00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Onto today's topic.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.905
Today we are going to be
focusing on issues associated

00:00:56.905 --> 00:01:00.000
with oxidation-reduction
half-reactions.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.470
And I want you think back to my
first lecture,

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.944
where I really talked a lot
about how unifying the concepts

00:01:07.944 --> 00:01:12.263
were that stemmed from the ideas
of Gilbert Newton Lewis,

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:16.042
because we talked about
acid-base, donor-acceptor,

00:01:16.042 --> 00:01:20.207
electrophile-neucleophile,
and oxidant-reductant all as

00:01:20.207 --> 00:01:23.755
parallel concepts,
with the related theme there

00:01:23.755 --> 00:01:29.000
being what is going on with the
electrons in the system.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.394
And it is really important to
consider not simply the

00:01:33.394 --> 00:01:37.704
reactions that occur between
molecules, but also the

00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:42.436
reactions that occur when
electrons coming from molecules

00:01:42.436 --> 00:01:47.507
or coming from ions or coming
from metals are connected up in

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:52.492
some kind of external circuit
that can be interfaced then to

00:01:52.492 --> 00:01:56.549
some real world problems through
the mechanism of

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.432
electrochemistry.
And so we will talk today about

00:02:01.432 --> 00:02:04.964
some of the basic concepts that
you will need.

00:02:04.964 --> 00:02:09.281
This will be the equipment that
you can use to do future

00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:12.812
research to solve the world's
energy problems.

00:02:12.812 --> 00:02:16.030
This is going to be good.
And it is pretty

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.562
straightforward.
I want to give you an example

00:02:19.562 --> 00:02:23.956
of a reaction that can be
decomposed into half-reactions.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:28.194
And that is the reaction of
magnesium metal with carbon

00:02:28.194 --> 00:02:31.935
dioxide.
And this will be two

00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:37.451
equivalence of magnesium going
to two magnesium O two plus

00:02:37.451 --> 00:02:41.806
elemental carbon.

00:02:41.806 --> 00:02:46.935
Now, this actually is an
important reaction in that it

00:02:46.935 --> 00:02:52.064
contains one molecule carbon
dioxide, that is really a

00:02:52.064 --> 00:02:57.774
critical energy and environment
molecule that we worry a lot

00:02:57.774 --> 00:03:02.209
about today.
I will emphasize this in a few

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.703
points during my lecture today,
but we want to be able to find

00:03:06.703 --> 00:03:11.049
ways of producing energy that
don't simultaneously produce a

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.689
whole lot of CO two that
goes up into the atmosphere and

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.446
is a greenhouse gas.
And so we will talk about that.

00:03:19.446 --> 00:03:23.792
I would like you to just start
thinking in the background of

00:03:23.792 --> 00:03:28.285
your mind right now about the
molecules, if you can list them,

00:03:28.285 --> 00:03:33.000
that are really important to
energy concerns today.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.512
With this reaction,
we can decompose this into the

00:03:38.512 --> 00:03:44.137
following half-reactions.
We can see that it can be

00:03:44.137 --> 00:03:51.112
written as carbon dioxide plus
four electrons plus four protons

00:03:51.112 --> 00:03:54.712
going to carbon plus two H two
O.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.000
And then simultaneously we can
also write two magnesium plus

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.000
two H two O going to magnesium
two equivalence O plus four H

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.389
plus plus four electrons.

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:23.491
Although the
reaction that one may actually

00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:29.491
carry out would be the one on
top here, that reaction can be

00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:34.779
separated out into the parts
that are associated with

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:42.000
oxidation and the parts that are
associated with reduction.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.131
And so, down here in equation
one, we see that CO two

00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:52.321
is undergoing reduction by four
electrons.

00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:56.000
This is a four electron
process.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.763
And down here,
in equation two,

00:04:58.763 --> 00:05:04.289
what we are seeing is that this
magnesium metal is ultimately

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.171
serving as a source of four
electrons in that process,

00:05:09.171 --> 00:05:14.144
each magnesium going to
magnesium two plus.

00:05:14.144 --> 00:05:18.381
There is implied,
here, that we are going to be

00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:24.000
able to know something also
about oxidation states.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.823
And so, as we talk about
oxidation-reduction processes,

00:05:27.823 --> 00:05:30.088
I want you to also,
if necessary,

00:05:30.088 --> 00:05:33.557
review about what you know
about the assignment of

00:05:33.557 --> 00:05:37.238
oxidation states in systems.
But by writing this out,

00:05:37.238 --> 00:05:40.707
you can see that on the left
side of equation one,

00:05:40.707 --> 00:05:44.035
electrons are going in.
And on the right side of

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:46.654
equation two electrons are
coming out.

00:05:46.654 --> 00:05:49.557
And, really,
if you can keep track of what

00:05:49.557 --> 00:05:53.946
the supply of the electrons are
and where the demand is for the

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:58.123
electrons in the overall system,
you will really have a good

00:05:58.123 --> 00:06:04.000
feeling for how these processes
physically may be taking place.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.147
And then, up here on top,
this is the sum of those two

00:06:09.147 --> 00:06:14.294
equations, one plus two.
And that is typical of how we

00:06:14.294 --> 00:06:18.179
write oxidation-reduction
half-reactions.

00:06:18.179 --> 00:06:22.550
And when we consider a pair of
half-reactions,

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:27.989
one of the things that we are
really interested in is the

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:31.000
potential difference.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.882
And that is to say if we have
some way, physically,

00:06:45.882 --> 00:06:51.058
of sequestering the two
individual half-reactions into

00:06:51.058 --> 00:06:55.355
different containers,
and if we allow them to

00:06:55.355 --> 00:07:01.312
communicate, but we don't allow
the reaction to proceed to any

00:07:01.312 --> 00:07:06.000
significant extent,
we can measure this.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.627
We can measure it when the
reaction is not allowed to

00:07:15.627 --> 00:07:18.000
proceed to a significant extent.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.422
And the reason for that latter
caveat is that when you put into

00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:37.320
communication two sequestered
cells that are each poised,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.393
one to undergo a reduction and
one to undergo an oxidation,

00:07:42.393 --> 00:07:47.116
then if you put them into
contact and let that reaction

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:51.227
start to proceed,
you can see that that reaction

00:07:51.227 --> 00:07:57.000
would proceed until such time as
equilibrium is reached.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.600
And so all throughout that
process, the potential

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:04.949
difference between the two would
be changing until it stops

00:08:04.949 --> 00:08:07.649
changing.
And when it stops changing,

00:08:07.649 --> 00:08:10.125
we would have reached
equilibrium.

00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:13.875
The two independent
half-reactions at the beginning

00:08:13.875 --> 00:08:17.850
have their own potential,
the degree to which they are

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:20.850
poised to undergo oxidation or
reduction.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:27.888
And then, how do we do this?
Well, you are going to see that

00:08:27.888 --> 00:08:32.779
we can use a thing called a salt
bridge.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:38.799
And with a salt bridge,
we can allow for not only

00:08:38.799 --> 00:08:46.200
communication of the electrons
from one of the half-reaction

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:52.220
cells to the other,
but we are also going to need

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:56.359
to allow for the movement of
ions.

00:08:56.359 --> 00:09:01.000
This permits ion movement.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.186
And this requirement for ion
movement stems from the

00:09:11.186 --> 00:09:15.152
necessity to maintain
electroneutrality,

00:09:15.152 --> 00:09:20.745
charge neutrality in each of
the two cells that we have,

00:09:20.745 --> 00:09:27.152
each of the two compartments of
the electrochemical cell that we

00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:31.688
are going to create.
And in reference to

00:09:31.688 --> 00:09:34.000
electrochemical cells,
--

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.463
-- there are lots of different
types of electrochemical cells.

00:09:49.463 --> 00:09:53.414
And today we are going to be
discussing two of these in

00:09:53.414 --> 00:09:56.268
particular.
We are going to start out by

00:09:56.268 --> 00:10:00.000
talking about what is called a
Galvanic cell.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.405
And then, I am going to talk
about how you can use Galvanic

00:10:04.405 --> 00:10:07.291
cells to measure standard
properties of

00:10:07.291 --> 00:10:09.873
oxidation-reduction
half-reactions.

00:10:09.873 --> 00:10:14.202
And then, after we do that,
we are going to talk about the

00:10:14.202 --> 00:10:16.784
properties of redox-active
systems.

00:10:16.784 --> 00:10:20.202
And then, finally,
I will finish up by talking

00:10:20.202 --> 00:10:23.392
about another type of
electrochemical cell,

00:10:23.392 --> 00:10:26.202
and this will be an
electrolytic cell.

00:10:26.202 --> 00:10:30.000
So, let's look at a Galvanic
cell.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.281
Last week I left my blue chalk
in here.

00:10:56.281 --> 00:10:57.859
Gone.
Oh, well.

00:10:57.859 --> 00:11:01.577
Down one color.
If anyone can find that blue

00:11:01.577 --> 00:11:04.000
chalk for me,
I will be very appreciative.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.394
As I have been alluding to,
we can set up an

00:11:26.394 --> 00:11:29.078
electrochemical cell.
In this case,

00:11:29.078 --> 00:11:33.184
called the Galvanic cell,
in which we sequestered two

00:11:33.184 --> 00:11:38.000
different half-reactions to the
different compartments.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:45.812
And then we are going need for
a control of the communication

00:11:45.812 --> 00:11:52.973
between the two compartments.
And we will do that in the

00:11:52.973 --> 00:11:57.791
following way.
What I am representing,

00:11:57.791 --> 00:12:03.000
here, is a piece of metallic
zinc.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.681
And the way I have drawn it,
it is supposed to be like a

00:12:08.681 --> 00:12:14.466
simple strip of zinc metal,
to which we could attach some

00:12:14.466 --> 00:12:20.665
alligator clips and can run an
external piece of wire over to

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:24.384
the other side.
And we can interpose,

00:12:24.384 --> 00:12:29.254
here, some kind of a meter.
This round unit,

00:12:29.254 --> 00:12:33.882
here, could be either a volt
meter or an ammeter to measure,

00:12:33.882 --> 00:12:36.392
respectively,
voltage or current,

00:12:36.392 --> 00:12:40.235
in a system like this.
And then, over on the other

00:12:40.235 --> 00:12:44.000
side, we will have a different
electrode.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:13:00.000
And this electrode will be made
of metallic copper.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.741
And I have got to have my salt
bridge so that we can maintain

00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:13.033
electroneutrality in these
solutions that we are going to

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:18.764
have on both sides in the two
separate compartments.

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:24.719
So, there is my salt bridge.
And this might contain an

00:13:24.719 --> 00:13:30.000
electrolyte, such as potassium
nitrate.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.509
And that electrolyte would be
suspended in a gelatinous medium

00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:40.025
like agar, for example.
And what we are going to be

00:13:40.025 --> 00:13:44.993
interested in will be the
directionality of the electron

00:13:44.993 --> 00:13:50.051
flow in a system like this.
We are going to be interested

00:13:50.051 --> 00:13:55.561
in the potential that gets set
up when the electrons flow in a

00:13:55.561 --> 00:14:00.016
system like this.
And we are going to want to

00:14:00.016 --> 00:14:04.349
know which side is the anode and
which side is the cathode,

00:14:04.349 --> 00:14:08.756
and what are the equations for
the reactions that are taking

00:14:08.756 --> 00:14:13.089
place at the side that is the
anode and at the side that is

00:14:13.089 --> 00:14:15.404
the cathode.
Let's look at that.

00:14:15.404 --> 00:14:20.036
Let me just point out that if I
had blue, I would be indicating

00:14:20.036 --> 00:14:22.501
the aqueous solution here in
blue.

00:14:22.501 --> 00:14:26.609
Maybe those of you who are
colorblind will think that is

00:14:26.609 --> 00:14:31.123
blue, but anyway.
The idea is that we have an

00:14:31.123 --> 00:14:33.955
aqueous solution here,
on both sides.

00:14:33.955 --> 00:14:36.393
And this one,
over on the right,

00:14:36.393 --> 00:14:40.955
is going to start off with some
concentration of copper two

00:14:40.955 --> 00:14:43.000
ions --

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.142
-- in solution.
So, some molarity of copper two

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:56.173
will be present in
the solution over here on the

00:14:56.173 --> 00:14:58.906
right-hand side,
where we have the copper

00:14:58.906 --> 00:15:01.967
electrode.
Inside the salt bridge,

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:07.101
we have potassium cations and
nitrate anions that can go into

00:15:07.101 --> 00:15:12.064
solution on either side to
balance the charged changes that

00:15:12.064 --> 00:15:16.171
are taking place as
oxidation-reduction reactions

00:15:16.171 --> 00:15:21.475
happen on the left-hand side and
on the right-hand side of this

00:15:21.475 --> 00:15:25.411
electrochemical cell,
which is a Galvanic cell.

00:15:25.411 --> 00:15:30.203
And so, what we find is that
you let this go into contact

00:15:30.203 --> 00:15:34.364
briefly.
And you would measure,

00:15:34.364 --> 00:15:36.944
for this cell,
1.1 volts.

00:15:36.944 --> 00:15:42.964
And so, that is the magnitude
of the potential difference

00:15:42.964 --> 00:15:49.413
between the two half-reactions
that are present on both sides

00:15:49.413 --> 00:15:52.530
of the cell.
And, furthermore,

00:15:52.530 --> 00:15:58.765
we would see that the electrons
are starting out over here,

00:15:58.765 --> 00:16:05.000
and they are going this way
around the circuit.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:12.656
And that tells us that what we
have on the left electrode at

00:16:12.656 --> 00:16:17.328
zinc is going to be called our
anode.

00:16:17.328 --> 00:16:22.000
That is because at the anode,
--

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.482
-- oxidation is taking place
because metallic zinc is

00:16:34.482 --> 00:16:39.332
undergoing oxidation and
becoming zinc two plus

00:16:39.332 --> 00:16:43.338
and providing,
in so doing,

00:16:43.338 --> 00:16:48.293
two electrons for every zinc
that gets oxidized.

00:16:48.293 --> 00:16:54.092
What you can think of as
happening over here on the side

00:16:54.092 --> 00:17:00.102
that we call the anode is that
you have this piece of zinc

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:04.662
metal.
And, in order for electrons to

00:17:04.662 --> 00:17:10.343
start coming out to the external
circuit, for every two electrons

00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:14.514
that comes around to the outside
of the circuit,

00:17:14.514 --> 00:17:20.017
you have a single zinc two plus
ion that jumps into

00:17:20.017 --> 00:17:23.301
solution.
A piece of zinc jumps off of

00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:28.360
the surface of the electrode.
That zinc atom leaves as the

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:34.766
zinc two plus ion.
That supplies two electrons to

00:17:34.766 --> 00:17:38.733
the external circuit.
And, at the same time,

00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:42.422
to balance charge,
we would have to have,

00:17:42.422 --> 00:17:47.679
from the salt bridge entering
solution, two NO three minus,

00:17:47.679 --> 00:17:50.631
two nitrate anions,

00:17:50.631 --> 00:17:55.703
because they are singly
charged, have to come out of the

00:17:55.703 --> 00:18:00.776
salt bridge and into solution
every time a zinc two plus

00:18:00.776 --> 00:18:06.218
drops away from the
electrode and starts flowing

00:18:06.218 --> 00:18:11.850
into the external circuit.
And electrons go around the

00:18:11.850 --> 00:18:15.482
initial voltage when the
reaction has not proceeded to

00:18:15.482 --> 00:18:18.291
any significant extent,
is this 1.1 volts.

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:22.129
So, we have measured the
potential difference between the

00:18:22.129 --> 00:18:24.802
two half-reactions.
Here is one of these

00:18:24.802 --> 00:18:27.063
half-reactions.
At the other side,

00:18:27.063 --> 00:18:31.038
if on the left side we have an
electrode that is the anode,

00:18:31.038 --> 00:18:35.149
then on the right-hand side we
must have an electrode that is

00:18:35.149 --> 00:18:37.000
the cathode.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.678
And we must have reduction
occurring there.

00:18:47.678 --> 00:18:52.759
And what is getting reduced?
Well, as electrons appear down

00:18:52.759 --> 00:18:57.489
here at this electrode,
they can encounter a copper two

00:18:57.489 --> 00:19:03.094
plus ion in solution
that can then become part of the

00:19:03.094 --> 00:19:08.000
surface of the electrode as a
copper metal atom.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.393
In other words,
we are depleting the surface of

00:19:11.393 --> 00:19:14.122
this piece of metallic zinc over
here.

00:19:14.122 --> 00:19:16.852
And zinc ions are going into
solution.

00:19:16.852 --> 00:19:20.909
And, on the right-hand side,
copper ions are coming from

00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:24.745
solution and becoming
incorporated into the electrode

00:19:24.745 --> 00:19:27.746
itself.
And so, if you ran this

00:19:27.746 --> 00:19:31.238
reaction for a while,
and then you took the two

00:19:31.238 --> 00:19:33.668
pieces of metal,
zinc and copper,

00:19:33.668 --> 00:19:37.084
that you had used to set up the
Galvanic cell,

00:19:37.084 --> 00:19:41.032
you could weigh them.
And you could see that the zinc

00:19:41.032 --> 00:19:44.828
electrode would have gotten
lighter, and the copper

00:19:44.828 --> 00:19:47.485
electrode would have gotten
heavier.

00:19:47.485 --> 00:19:51.281
And so, that is also the basis
for the technique of

00:19:51.281 --> 00:19:54.546
electroplating,
where you can take one metal

00:19:54.546 --> 00:19:59.101
and cover over the surface of it
with a thin layer of another

00:19:59.101 --> 00:20:03.357
metal.
Here we are just putting a new

00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:07.680
layer of copper on the surface
of this copper electrode,

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:11.688
and we are depleting what we
call, over on the left,

00:20:11.688 --> 00:20:15.617
the sacrificial zinc anode.
And this reaction then,

00:20:15.617 --> 00:20:19.940
over on the right-hand side,
is copper two plus plus two

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:24.891
electrons going to copper metal.

00:20:24.891 --> 00:20:30.000
So, that is a prototypical
example of a Galvanic cell.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.076
And in setting that up and
thinking about what is happening

00:20:36.076 --> 00:20:42.571
there, in terms of depletion of
one electrode so that the other

00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:48.752
one can be increased in mass,
you may be aware that you know

00:20:48.752 --> 00:20:53.676
of places where this principle
is actually used.

00:20:53.676 --> 00:20:56.609
In construction,
for example,

00:20:56.609 --> 00:21:03.000
there are large steel bridges
that are constructed.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.350
And one does not want those to
oxidize away and to become

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.779
fragile in their structure,
so that bridges break down and

00:21:11.779 --> 00:21:15.042
bridges are not safe anymore,
shall we say.

00:21:15.042 --> 00:21:19.393
And so, what is often done
there is large pieces of zinc,

00:21:19.393 --> 00:21:23.200
actually, are put into
electrical contact with the

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.862
metal of the bridge so that it
is the zinc that actually gets

00:21:27.862 --> 00:21:32.368
oxidized away as a sacrificial
anode, instead of the bridge

00:21:32.368 --> 00:21:36.329
itself.
The same for any of you who are

00:21:36.329 --> 00:21:40.612
sailors or boaters in general.
You probably know that zinc

00:21:40.612 --> 00:21:45.121
anodes are present usually in
several places on boats so that

00:21:45.121 --> 00:21:49.780
electrolysis does not occur and
corrode away the metal parts of

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.710
your boat.
Instead, the zinc sacrificial

00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:56.543
anode is oxidized away and is a
source of electrons.

00:21:56.543 --> 00:22:00.000
So, that is an important
principle.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.811
Once you have started looking
at some different kinds of

00:22:13.811 --> 00:22:16.168
oxidation-reduction
half-reactions,

00:22:16.168 --> 00:22:20.326
you are going to want to know
just how oxidizing is something

00:22:20.326 --> 00:22:22.613
or just how reducing is
something.

00:22:22.613 --> 00:22:26.425
And, in order to do this,
we need to pick one particular

00:22:26.425 --> 00:22:31.000
half-reaction that will serve as
our universal standard.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.666
And, to that half-reaction,
we will compare everything

00:22:34.666 --> 00:22:37.018
else.
And so, that brings us to the

00:22:37.018 --> 00:22:40.823
discussion of standard reduction
potentials, or standard

00:22:40.823 --> 00:22:42.000
potentials.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
For this, I am going to make
another Galvanic cell.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:23.873
And, concerning this Galvanic
cell, we will have a number of

00:23:23.873 --> 00:23:26.631
the same questions that we have
had before.

00:23:26.631 --> 00:23:30.439
But the one that we are going
to be using on the right-hand

00:23:30.439 --> 00:23:33.000
side is going to be very
special.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.994
Here we indicate our water
line, again, in green.

00:23:39.994 --> 00:23:47.864
And I am going to put in a salt
bridge into the system.

00:23:47.864 --> 00:23:56.316
And I will have an electrode,
here, on the left and another

00:23:56.316 --> 00:24:02.000
electrode over here on the
right.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.977
We will connect up these
electrode using alligator clips.

00:24:10.977 --> 00:24:14.173
We will need an external
circuit with a meter,

00:24:14.173 --> 00:24:17.937
so we will be able to compare
the potential of the two

00:24:17.937 --> 00:24:21.701
half-reactions of interest.
But then, over here on the

00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:25.607
right, this electrode is going
to be a little different.

00:24:25.607 --> 00:24:29.798
Because this one is going to
have something like a test-tube

00:24:29.798 --> 00:24:35.080
inverted over it --
-- because the reaction that we

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.948
will talk about here,
in fact, does involve a gas.

00:24:39.948 --> 00:24:45.214
And that gas is hydrogen,
another one of our important

00:24:45.214 --> 00:24:51.275
energy molecules to be talking
about in the context of today's

00:24:51.275 --> 00:24:55.150
lecture.
At the end, I would like to see

00:24:55.150 --> 00:25:01.112
if you have a list of energy
molecules collected from today's

00:25:01.112 --> 00:25:05.186
lecture.
But also, we are going to

00:25:05.186 --> 00:25:08.596
choose, as the electrode
material, here,

00:25:08.596 --> 00:25:11.920
this metal piece of electrode
material.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:17.079
This is going to be platinum.
And the reason we are going to

00:25:17.079 --> 00:25:20.490
choose platinum,
a very common electrode

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:26.000
material, is that platinum is a
so-called noble metal.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.004
And that means that it is quite
impervious to most chemical

00:25:35.004 --> 00:25:37.559
reactions.
Over there, we were talking

00:25:37.559 --> 00:25:41.977
about zinc and copper electrodes
that themselves do change during

00:25:41.977 --> 00:25:43.841
the reaction.
And over here,

00:25:43.841 --> 00:25:47.432
we want to have a piece of
metal that can provide the

00:25:47.432 --> 00:25:51.229
valuable function of giving us
electrical contact of the

00:25:51.229 --> 00:25:55.164
chemical reactions on the two
sides, but an electrode that

00:25:55.164 --> 00:25:59.307
will remain clean and unchanged
at its surface throughout the

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:04.542
course of the reaction.
So, we use a platinum electrode

00:26:04.542 --> 00:26:07.822
over here.
And you can see that with this

00:26:07.822 --> 00:26:12.825
inverted test tube through which
the wire passes and with some

00:26:12.825 --> 00:26:16.925
kind of a provision for a side
arm attachment here,

00:26:16.925 --> 00:26:20.862
we can hook up a cylinder of H
two gas.

00:26:20.862 --> 00:26:25.619
And we can start bubbling H two
over this electrode,

00:26:25.619 --> 00:26:30.211
like this, so that it actually
will have bubbles of H two

00:26:30.211 --> 00:26:35.878
coming out like that.
In fact, this solution over

00:26:35.878 --> 00:26:40.142
here will be saturated with H
two.

00:26:40.142 --> 00:26:46.005
And a further consideration for
our reference electrode,

00:26:46.005 --> 00:26:52.507
which is going to be known as
the standard hydrogen electrode,

00:26:52.507 --> 00:26:54.000
or SHE.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.268
That is, the electrode against
which everything else is going

00:27:12.268 --> 00:27:15.507
to be compared.
And it also has,

00:27:15.507 --> 00:27:20.208
in the solution here,
1.0 molar H three O plus.

00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:23.761
So, indeed, it is a very

00:27:23.761 --> 00:27:29.615
strongly acidic medium.
And what we are measuring,

00:27:29.615 --> 00:27:35.149
over on the right-hand side,
is a half reaction that may

00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:41.185
correspond either to two H plus
plus two electrons going to

00:27:41.185 --> 00:27:44.405
H two.

00:27:44.405 --> 00:27:49.737
And that will be the case if
this side is the cathode.

00:27:49.737 --> 00:27:53.963
But if this side turns out to
be the anode,

00:27:53.963 --> 00:28:00.000
then we would be measuring the
opposite reaction.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.814
And I will talk more about that
in a second.

00:28:03.814 --> 00:28:08.338
Let's say, for example,
that our electrode over here

00:28:08.338 --> 00:28:11.000
is, in fact, made of zinc.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.783
If our electrode over here is
made of zinc.

00:28:22.783 --> 00:28:27.558
And we may have zinc two plus
in solution,

00:28:27.558 --> 00:28:32.873
here, and we may again have
something like potassium nitrate

00:28:32.873 --> 00:28:37.648
or some other
electrolyte present in our salt

00:28:37.648 --> 00:28:41.069
bridge.
Then what we can do is put

00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:43.695
these things briefly into
contact.

00:28:43.695 --> 00:28:48.072
And we want to know two things.
We want to know what the

00:28:48.072 --> 00:28:52.211
magnitude of the potential
difference is and what the

00:28:52.211 --> 00:28:57.145
direction in which the electrons
are flowing is so that we know

00:28:57.145 --> 00:29:02.000
which one is the cathode and
which one is the anode.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.638
And, in this particular case,
the direction of electron flow

00:29:07.638 --> 00:29:10.791
is, as before,
away from the zinc.

00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:16.143
Once again, zinc atoms are
jumping off the surface of the

00:29:16.143 --> 00:29:20.252
electrode as zinc two plus
ions.

00:29:20.252 --> 00:29:25.412
And, every time that happens,
two electrons go into the

00:29:25.412 --> 00:29:30.000
external circuit and come around
here.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.320
And the chemical reaction that
occurs here, in this case,

00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.718
is that those two electrons
that came from one of the zinc

00:29:38.718 --> 00:29:43.115
atoms react, as shown here,
with two H plus ions to make

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.584
H two.

00:29:45.584 --> 00:29:49.133
And so, we know the direction of
electron flow,

00:29:49.133 --> 00:29:53.376
we know the exact reactions
that are taking place on the

00:29:53.376 --> 00:29:57.524
left and on the right.
And we know that,

00:29:57.524 --> 00:30:02.903
for this particular choice of
substances, our anode is on the

00:30:02.903 --> 00:30:06.220
left, and our cathode is on the
right.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.000
And let me come over here.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.668
There is another way that I can
write this cell.

00:30:21.668 --> 00:30:27.033
And so, I would like to
introduce cell notation to you.

00:30:27.033 --> 00:30:32.000
And that will be like this.
We will have zinc.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:41.267
And then, a solid line.
And then, zinc two plus.

00:30:41.267 --> 00:30:48.760
And then, a solid double
vertical line.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:57.633
And then, H plus,
another solid vertical line,

00:30:57.633 --> 00:31:02.696
H two.
And then another solid line.

00:31:02.696 --> 00:31:07.320
And then platinum.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.594
That is the way I set that up.

00:31:10.594 --> 00:31:15.410
We could, actually,
add another solid line here and

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:20.322
put platinum over here.
The thing that I want you to

00:31:20.322 --> 00:31:26.005
recognize about this notation
for Galvanic cells is that the

00:31:26.005 --> 00:31:31.303
solid single lines represent
interfaces, direct contacts

00:31:31.303 --> 00:31:36.031
between things.
Here, it would be a platinum

00:31:36.031 --> 00:31:39.659
solid electrode
connected with solid zinc,

00:31:39.659 --> 00:31:43.070
possibly.
And then, the way I drew it

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:47.278
over there, it would just be
solid zinc, no platinum on the

00:31:47.278 --> 00:31:49.383
left.
And then this solid line

00:31:49.383 --> 00:31:53.446
represents a solid liquid
interface because the electrode

00:31:53.446 --> 00:31:57.727
is dipped into a solution that
contains zinc two

00:31:57.727 --> 00:32:00.122
ions.
And that is in communication

00:32:00.122 --> 00:32:04.258
with the other half of this
electrochemical cell by a salt

00:32:04.258 --> 00:32:08.112
bridge.
And the salt bridge is

00:32:08.112 --> 00:32:11.855
represented by the double
vertical line.

00:32:11.855 --> 00:32:14.640
And then we have,
in solution,

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:17.807
protons.
And then, a solid liquid.

00:32:17.807 --> 00:32:20.496
Well, actually,
in this case,

00:32:20.496 --> 00:32:25.584
a liquid gas interface to the
gaseous H two.

00:32:25.584 --> 00:32:30.000
And H two is also
dissolved.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.919
In order for this to be used as
a reference electrode,

00:32:34.919 --> 00:32:38.167
we have to pick standard
conditions.

00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:43.922
And so, we are usually talking
about one atmosphere of hydrogen

00:32:43.922 --> 00:32:47.170
for the standard hydrogen
electrode.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:52.275
And we are talking about a
concentration of 1.0 molar of

00:32:52.275 --> 00:32:56.544
our strong acid.
And so, those are our standard

00:32:56.544 --> 00:33:01.000
conditions, along with 25
degrees C.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.470
And then this solution that
contains the protons and the

00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:10.266
hydrogen gas is in a solution
solid interface with the solid

00:33:10.266 --> 00:33:14.817
platinum electrode that is not
going to be undergoing any

00:33:14.817 --> 00:33:17.906
change.
So, these are the types of cell

00:33:17.906 --> 00:33:21.970
notations that you will
encounter when looking into

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:25.790
electrochemistry.
And we found out that the left

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:30.342
side, where the zinc metal
is going to zinc two

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:34.000
plus,
is our anode.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.239
And also, the potential
difference, when we measure it

00:33:39.239 --> 00:33:45.171
using our voltmeter right here
by turning on the contact very

00:33:45.171 --> 00:33:51.003
briefly, is around 0.763 volts.
So, that is the magnitude of

00:33:51.003 --> 00:33:56.243
our potential difference.
And this is equal to delta E

00:33:56.243 --> 00:34:02.625
zero cell.
When I write E zero,

00:34:02.625 --> 00:34:08.250
that means standard potential.
And this is written as a delta

00:34:08.250 --> 00:34:12.562
here because that is the
difference between the

00:34:12.562 --> 00:34:17.156
potentials for the two
half-reactions that we have

00:34:17.156 --> 00:34:20.906
written up there.
But it is a very simple

00:34:20.906 --> 00:34:26.718
difference precisely because the
standard hydrogen electrode is

00:34:26.718 --> 00:34:32.608
our reference electrode.
Over here we want to write the

00:34:32.608 --> 00:34:36.000
definition of standard cell
potential.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:14.277
And that is a delta E zero for
your cell is equal to delta E

00:35:14.277 --> 00:35:21.555
zero for your cathode minus--
Sorry, this is not delta here.

00:35:21.555 --> 00:35:28.462
Just E zero for your cathode
minus E zero for your anode.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.432
But E zero for the
standard hydrogen electrode,

00:35:44.432 --> 00:35:49.276
because this is our reference
electrode, is equal to zero at

00:35:49.276 --> 00:35:51.000
all temperatures.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:02.316
And that is by definition.
So, the standard potential for

00:36:02.316 --> 00:36:08.069
that set of conditions that
constitutes our standard

00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:14.273
hydrogen electrode is taken as
the zero of potential for

00:36:14.273 --> 00:36:21.041
comparison with any other type
of half cell that you might be

00:36:21.041 --> 00:36:25.891
able to consider.
And so, we can see further

00:36:25.891 --> 00:36:32.433
that, in this particular case,
where we have our cathode as

00:36:32.433 --> 00:36:39.314
the standard hydrogen electrode,
we have zero and minus E zero

00:36:39.314 --> 00:36:45.518
for the anode,
which we measured as 0.763

00:36:45.518 --> 00:36:48.000
volts.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.509
That means that for the
reaction zinc going to zinc two

00:36:57.509 --> 00:37:01.852
plus plus two electrons,

00:37:01.852 --> 00:37:06.862
which is our anodic reaction,
we have a standard potential of

00:37:06.862 --> 00:37:09.117
-0.763 volts.
And generally,

00:37:09.117 --> 00:37:12.291
what you are going to be
interested in,

00:37:12.291 --> 00:37:17.301
as you consider different kinds
of substances from throughout

00:37:17.301 --> 00:37:21.644
the periodic table with
reference to their ability to

00:37:21.644 --> 00:37:25.235
take place in
oxidation-reduction reactions,

00:37:25.235 --> 00:37:29.411
is you are going to want to
know what your standard

00:37:29.411 --> 00:37:33.758
potential is.
You are not going to always

00:37:33.758 --> 00:37:37.730
have a system that you want to
consider that is under standard

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:40.074
conditions.
These standard potentials

00:37:40.074 --> 00:37:43.265
always are referenced to some
standard conditions,

00:37:43.265 --> 00:37:47.367
as I mentioned specifically for
the standard hydrogen electrode.

00:37:47.367 --> 00:37:51.339
And so, part of next lecture on
Monday is we are going to show

00:37:51.339 --> 00:37:54.725
you how to handle systems that
are not under standard

00:37:54.725 --> 00:37:58.437
conditions because then you can
handle some real practical

00:37:58.437 --> 00:38:02.023
problems.
But let's look at a different

00:38:02.023 --> 00:38:03.000
type of cell.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Let's write down the following
cell.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.942
This new cell that I have
written the cell notation for,

00:38:43.942 --> 00:38:48.315
instead of drawing up the whole
diagram of this Galvanic cell,

00:38:48.315 --> 00:38:52.688
happens to be one in which we
have platinum electrodes on both

00:38:52.688 --> 00:38:54.910
sides.
Here we have the silver |

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:58.924
silver plus
redox couple on the left-hand

00:38:58.924 --> 00:39:02.240
side.
And we have the redox couple of

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:06.216
H plus with H two
on the right-hand side.

00:39:06.216 --> 00:39:09.831
So, the right-hand side
corresponds to the standard

00:39:09.831 --> 00:39:13.445
hydrogen electrode,
and the left-hand side is a new

00:39:13.445 --> 00:39:16.048
redox couple,
or a new half-reaction,

00:39:16.048 --> 00:39:20.385
that we want to compare to the
standard hydrogen electrode so

00:39:20.385 --> 00:39:23.204
that we will know,
on an absolute scale,

00:39:23.204 --> 00:39:27.325
where it falls relative to all
the other half-reactions we

00:39:27.325 --> 00:39:31.684
might want to measure.
And so, we want to know,

00:39:31.684 --> 00:39:34.000
which way do the electrons
flow?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.333
And, in this case,
it turns out that the direction

00:39:43.333 --> 00:39:48.285
of electron flow is this way.
So, this is the opposite of

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:53.238
what we talked about in the case
of comparing zinc to the

00:39:53.238 --> 00:39:57.659
standard hydrogen electrode.
Electron flow has been

00:39:57.659 --> 00:40:00.931
reversed.
What that means is that this

00:40:00.931 --> 00:40:05.000
over here, the SHE is now our
anode.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.109
And now the silver-silver plus
electrode is our

00:40:11.109 --> 00:40:14.656
cathode.
And we want to know not only

00:40:14.656 --> 00:40:20.667
the direction of electron flow,
the direction of electron flow

00:40:20.667 --> 00:40:26.284
tells us what is doing the
reduction and what is doing the

00:40:26.284 --> 00:40:32.000
oxidation, but we also want to
know the magnitude.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.572
And this one turns out to be,
this delta E cell,

00:40:37.572 --> 00:40:43.144
is equal to 0.8 volts.
And, by the definition of

00:40:43.144 --> 00:40:49.190
standard cell potentials that I
gave you over there,

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:55.355
you can see that what we are
getting now, because the

00:40:55.355 --> 00:41:00.927
electron flow is reversed,
our sign is reversed,

00:41:00.927 --> 00:41:06.737
and so our E zero for the
reaction Ag plus plus an

00:41:06.737 --> 00:41:12.902
electron going to silver is

00:41:12.902 --> 00:41:18.000
equal to 0.8 volts,
positive.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.169
Notice that the zinc-zinc two
plus couple was

00:41:22.169 --> 00:41:25.996
negative with respect to the
standard hydrogen electrode,

00:41:25.996 --> 00:41:29.892
but because the electron flow
is reversed for silver plus,

00:41:29.892 --> 00:41:32.762
silver redox couple,
we now have a positive

00:41:32.762 --> 00:41:37.000
potential relative to the
standard hydrogen electrode.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:51.310
What would like to arrive at is
a nice big table where we look

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:54.000
at standard potential --

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.179
-- with reference to this
standard hydrogen electrode,

00:42:06.179 --> 00:42:12.140
which is our zero of potential.
And you will be able to find a

00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:17.807
table like this in your book.
What we found is that zinc is

00:42:17.807 --> 00:42:22.693
down here at -0.763,
so that was zinc-zinc two plus

00:42:22.693 --> 00:42:28.557
at a negative
potential relative to hydrogen

00:42:28.557 --> 00:42:33.790
plus electrons.
We found that up here at +0.8,

00:42:33.790 --> 00:42:39.279
we have the silver-silver plus
redox couple.

00:42:39.279 --> 00:42:44.395
These are thermodynamic
quantities, so you can look on a

00:42:44.395 --> 00:42:49.418
table of standard reduction
potentials and you can tell

00:42:49.418 --> 00:42:54.906
which direction electrons will
flow if you set up cells that

00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:59.000
involve those redox
half-reactions.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.086
Another electrode that we used
today was copper two plus

00:43:04.086 --> 00:43:09.820
combining with two electrons to
give copper metal.

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.705
It turns out that one is

00:43:13.705 --> 00:43:17.497
positive also by about positive
0.3 volts.

00:43:17.497 --> 00:43:23.231
You see hydrogen is here and it
reduces silver-silver plus.

00:43:23.231 --> 00:43:27.115
Hydrogen reduces silver plus to

00:43:27.115 --> 00:43:32.430
silver because it is up there.
Zinc is down here.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:37.197
Zinc also serves as an anode
with respect to any one of those

00:43:37.197 --> 00:43:41.884
three because all of those three
are at a potential positive

00:43:41.884 --> 00:43:45.936
relative to zinc on this scale
of standard reduction

00:43:45.936 --> 00:43:49.035
potentials.
You can also have some other

00:43:49.035 --> 00:43:53.484
potentials, like way down here
at about -2.7 volts is the

00:43:53.484 --> 00:43:57.219
sodium-sodium plus
redox couple,

00:43:57.219 --> 00:44:02.451
way down there at -2.7
That is why sodium is so much

00:44:02.451 --> 00:44:05.241
fun to heave into a body of
water.

00:44:05.241 --> 00:44:09.300
I mean, it is fantastic.
You get reduction of the

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:13.104
protons to make hydrogen,
which then explodes.

00:44:13.104 --> 00:44:17.416
So, this is fantastic.
And some of you may know that

00:44:17.416 --> 00:44:21.559
there is an annual,
and I am not recommending that

00:44:21.559 --> 00:44:25.956
you do this, by the way.
You can see how negative the

00:44:25.956 --> 00:44:32.167
potential is down here.
Metallic sodium is a very

00:44:32.167 --> 00:44:35.842
strong reducing agent,
indeed.

00:44:35.842 --> 00:44:42.938
A very important reaction is up
here at about +1.23 volts

00:44:42.938 --> 00:44:48.386
relative to the standard
hydrogen electrode.

00:44:48.386 --> 00:44:56.243
And this important reaction is
oxygen plus four H pus plus four

00:44:56.243 --> 00:45:03.972
electrons going to two H two O.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.234
So, this +1.23 volts is very
important.

00:45:14.234 --> 00:45:18.489
In the time remaining,
I am not going to be able to

00:45:18.489 --> 00:45:23.085
tell you about electrolysis.
I believe next hour I will

00:45:23.085 --> 00:45:27.000
start off by talking about
electrolysis.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.981
And, if you can do electrolysis
using oxidizing and reducing

00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:35.950
equivalents that derive from
photovoltaic cells,

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:40.931
so you are converting sunlight
into separated electron whole

00:45:40.931 --> 00:45:45.829
pairs, you can drive a reaction
like this the other way and

00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:50.472
learn how to make oxygen from
water, and ultimately also

00:45:50.472 --> 00:45:54.272
hydrogen from water.
We will talk about that a

00:45:54.272 --> 00:45:57.005
little bit next time.
Have a nice weekend.
