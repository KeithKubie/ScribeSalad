so if I put you in situation a then DNA

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
help make up the way that your mind is
 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:29.930 align:start position:0%
help make up the way that your mind is
and<00:05:28.110><c> the</c><00:05:28.169><c> way</c><00:05:28.289><c> it</c><00:05:28.440><c> works</c><00:05:28.710><c> but</c><00:05:29.400><c> if</c><00:05:29.490><c> I</c><00:05:29.550><c> take</c><00:05:29.820><c> you</c>

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
and the way it works but if I take you
 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.180 align:start position:0%
and the way it works but if I take you
and<00:05:30.060><c> I</c><00:05:30.090><c> put</c><00:05:30.210><c> you</c><00:05:30.360><c> in</c><00:05:30.449><c> another</c><00:05:30.479><c> situation</c>

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 align:start position:0%
and I put you in another situation
 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.770 align:start position:0%
and I put you in another situation
completely<00:05:32.190><c> different</c><00:05:32.580><c> genes</c><00:05:32.849><c> turn</c><00:05:33.240><c> on</c><00:05:33.449><c> and</c>

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 align:start position:0%
completely different genes turn on and
 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.170 align:start position:0%
completely different genes turn on and

so what that means is that you have a
 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
so what that means is that you have a
