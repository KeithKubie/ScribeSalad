[Captions by Mike R. at YTranslator.com]
Hey, guys. I'm Nate.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.140
Welcome back to the studio.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:06.560
Today, we've got another fun experiment
suggested to us by user, Maverick Miller.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.840
He asks, "Can you freeze
diesel fuel with liquid nitrogen?"

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.680
Well, Maverick Miller, I'm pretty sure
I know the answer to this one.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.440
But we're gonna try it out anyway, and then
see if we can come up with a twist on it,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.940
to see what results we get.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.060
To start off I've got this little bottle
which I've filled with diesel fuel.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.020
I do think this diesel has
some additives added into it.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.720
That's what gives us this nice yellow color.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.220
I just poured this out of a diesel can
that Grant had in his shed.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.420
Diesel fuel can start to gel and turn thick,
at about 30º Fahrenheit.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:40.100
So, I'm pretty sure that at -320º Fahrenheit,
it's going to freeze solid.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.820
But let's see what happens if we do
and see if it can still burn once it's frozen.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.870
You may recall that we've tried this
with gasoline –

[SOUNDS OF FAST-BURNING
FLAME AND HELPER YELLING]

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.480
– and had some fun results.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.601
To start off, let's pour some of
the diesel into a metal bowl,

00:00:53.601 --> 00:00:56.520
and see what happens if we try and
light it without freezing it.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.480
Also, I should note,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.980
this is not an approved container
for long-term diesel storage.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.180
I poured it in here for this experiment,

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.720
and I'm going to be
throwing it away once I'm done.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.399
I don't know for sure
what the diesel would do

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.980
to this specific bottle eventually,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.780
but I know it's not good
for long-term storage.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.840
We'll pour some diesel out into the bowl
and see if this will light.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.320
[CLICKS LIGHTER]

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.460

Not getting much of an effect here.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.540
Time to upgrade our fire.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.720
That little barbecue lighter
was a little wimpy,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.340
so we've upgraded to a propane torch.

So, a barbecue lighter – not so much.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.080
A propane torch definitely
will get diesel to light.

it suctioned these two bowls together.

had clean enough edges.

Like, it didn't even occur to me
that that might happen.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.500
But now, of course, I have to see
if I can make it do it again.

All right. Well, now we know
what happens with normal diesel.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.660
We can light it on fire
using our propane torch.

Let's freeze some of it
and see how it does.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.700
All right. Now let's take our liquid nitrogen,
pour some off into our Styrofoam cup,

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.580
and then we'll pour our diesel
directly into that cup.

Let's see what happens.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.520
All right. There's one little bead of diesel
floating around the surface of our nitrogen.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.780
It sort of freezes and
then falls down to the bottom.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.600
I wonder if it doesn't stay as one clump –
kind of breaks itself up.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.360
I'm not really finding much. 
So let's just pour in a bigger amount.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.800
How weird!

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.100
It freezes on the outside layer very quickly,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.240
but then the inside layer sort of expands
and pushes its way out.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.220
And it was giving us sort of like
a hollow sheath made of diesel, I think.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.060
That, I think, is frozen diesel.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.940
And then, of course, it's just gonna
warm right back up in our bowl.

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:48.099
Let's pour this all back in and we'll pour in
another little healthy dose of diesel fuel.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.900
I'm also going to splash just a tiny bit
of liquid nitrogen down into our bowl

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.880
just to cool the bowl down,
so it stays frozen when I pour it in there.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.520
I hope all of this
liquid nitrogen will evaporate,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.080
but leave us with a very cold bowl.

Yeah, we're getting a good chunk
of frozen diesel here.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.480
And I think with our cooled bowl,
we'll be able to take that chunk,

[Grant]: Craziness!

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.880
[Nate]: You can get it to burn,

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.020
but it takes kind of 
a lot of concentrated, directed heat,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.040
and a little bit of time –
unlike the gasoline,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.740
which kind of just
goes up immediately.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.960
One more thing I do want to try. 
This is an anti-gelling agent.

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.840
It's designed to help keep your diesel
from freezing in low temperatures.

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.980
If you have a truck that runs on diesel
and it gets really cold,

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:30.780
the fuel can actually start to gel up
inside your car's fuel lines and tank.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.180
This is supposed to help
keep that from happening.

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.140
So, let's add a little bit
of this to our diesel, and see

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.700
if that does anything to prevent it
from freezing in liquid nitrogen.

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.540
Normally, the ratio is such that this
one bottle could treat up to 40 gallons.

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.720
The instructions recommend that
if you're going to be using it

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:50.940
in temperatures below 0º Fahrenheit,
you use this much in 20 gallons.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:54.100
Here, I have a little bit less
than one cup of diesel,

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.640
which, by my math, means
we should be using

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.600
about 1/4 teaspoon
of our anti-gelling agent.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:03.640
Liquid nitrogen is a lot colder
than 0º Fahrenheit.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.880
So, I'm gonna go as far as to add
one whole teaspoon of our anti-gelling agent

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.680
and see if it does anything.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.300

the same thing as before – freezing.

Well, that's frozen.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.520
It does seem like maybe it broke up
into smaller pieces this time.

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:49.980
So, maybe it does do something.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.020
It doesn't stop it from freezing.

00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:55.600
But I think it might make it
so it freezes into smaller particles.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.860
It's not gonna help much
if it's in your engine.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.500

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.080
to slow down the freezing process
of our liquid nitrogen.

Now, just as an experiment,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:08.200
let's see if we can freeze
our anti-freezing agent.

[LIQUID FIZZING]

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.300
Looks like we've got
an interesting structure here.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.160
[LAUGHS]

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.040
As I lowered the spoon
full of our anti-freezing agent

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.120
into the liquid nitrogen, it started
freezing around on the sides

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.160
and then more toward the middle.

00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.350
And that made it so that
all of the unfrozen liquid underneath

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.890
had only one place to go to escape,

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:37.740
and that was pushing up from the center.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:43.660
So, now, we've got a sort of
stalagmite of our anti-freezing agent.

00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:48.440
I guess this is maybe sort of like when
we tested if you can freeze antifreeze.

00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.400
And the answer is,
"Yes, you can."

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.060
And similarly, you can freeze
the anti-gelling agent for diesel.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:57.820
Liquid nitrogen is just too darned cold.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.400
So, to recap, we tried freezing diesel fuel
in liquid nitrogen and it froze.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.920
It froze very much the same way
that gasoline did.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:08.160
The frozen diesel fuel
did not light on fire very easily.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.680
It had a really hard time getting started,

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.780
and we really had to hit it
with the blowtorch until it was hot enough

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:16.200
to start letting off fumes,
at which point it was mostly melted.

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.740
So, when you freeze gasoline, it will
light on fire even while it's still frozen.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.200
The diesel doesn't seem
to have that same effect.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:25.940
We also tested whether or not
you can use an anti-gelling agent

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:28.660
to keep the diesel from freezing
in the liquid nitrogen.

00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.700
That didn't seem to do really anything
for how fast it froze,

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.240
although it might have changed the texture
of the frozen diesel a little bit.

00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.560
It seemed a little bit more crumbly to me.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:40.240
As a final experiment, we also
tested if you can just freeze

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.960
the anti-gelling agent itself.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.960
And it turns out you can.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.100
Liquid nitrogen is so cold,
it freezes just about everything.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.000
Well, there you have it.
