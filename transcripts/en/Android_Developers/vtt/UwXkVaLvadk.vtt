00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:09.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Good morning everyone and welcome
to a special tablet week edition of Android

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.539
Developers Strike Back.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:14.779
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Tablet week is like Shark Week
except not nearly as boring.

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:15.779
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's true.

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:16.779
That's not only true.

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.150
In fact, we're going to have to look at three
tablet apps today.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.259
We've got the developers from Mint, TinyCompany
and the Instapaper developers as well.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I think they actually call themselves
TinyCo.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:29.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: TinyCo.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.570
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: TinyCo.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.570
Okay.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.960
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: TinyCompany kind of sounds like
one of their games actually.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Actually, that's very true.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
All right.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.910
Well, we will--we will ask the TinyCo guys
about their naming choice for their brand

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.910
when we speak to them.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.679
So, we got those three apps to go through.

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:48.530
We're going to kind of spend about 10 minutes
on each.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.170
Find out a little bit about their experience
developing for tablets; what successes they've

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.319
had; what tips they've got for other developers
looking to develop for tablet as well.

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:59.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Excellent.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.319
So, I think we're going to start with Mint.com.

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:02.510
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We are--we are going to start with
Mint.com.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.510
Let's see if I got the slides right.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.510
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:06.510
&gt;&gt; TAN: There we go.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.510
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hey, check that out.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.510
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice, very nice.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.510
So, welcome.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.510
Thank you for joining us.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.510
&gt;&gt; TAN: Hi.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So you want to introduce yourself.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.830
Tell us a little bit about yourself and Mint.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:15.830
&gt;&gt; TAN: Sure.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.250
So, my name is Brian Tan and I'm actually
the product owner for the Android side for

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.250
Mint.com.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.960
So, I'm just happy to be here.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.120
I'm happy to talk to a little bit about Mint
and kind of our tablet experience.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Outstanding.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.030
So, I'm going to ask the same few questions
to everyone.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.870
I think we start off; just tell us a little
bit about Mint, about the app which you've

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.870
designed for tablet.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.240
You know, a little bit about the experiences
around, you know, what makes this a tablet

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.820
specific version of the app?

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.820
&gt;&gt; TAN: Sure.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.800
So, you know, Mint.com, first off, is a way
for you to take a look at your finances on

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.850
your tablet.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.680
Essentially, we aggregate all of your various
accounts, you know, credit accounts, checking

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.980
accounts and things of that sort on the tablet
so that you can have one view of your finances

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.140
and basically stay on top of them.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.410
You know, we have a website and then we wanted
to build a tablet app.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.950
And so what we did is we decided to take kind
of the best of what was on the Web and then

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.300
bring it to the tablet.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.940
But more specifically, you know, we want to
build this thing from the ground up.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.530
We want to make it native.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.220
And then we said we want to make it cool,
we want to make it interesting.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.750
I mean finances, for the most part, people
don't really think of it as cool and interesting,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.750
right?

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.750
It's not what I do for fun.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.750
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.440
So, you know, on the--on the overview screen
here that we've got, you know, basically we

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.580
have tried--just tried to make it a very rich
experience.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Okay.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.580
&gt;&gt; TAN: You know we have a nice little graphic
in the upper left-hand corner.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Dan, can you bring that up actually?

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.370
Just one second.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.370
&gt;&gt; TAN: Sure.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.160
Just so that you could quickly see kind of,
you know where your finances are in terms

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.530
of what you're spending.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.920
We've got nice little bar graphs in the right
and then nice little icons that represent

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920
spending there.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: By the way, I hope you don't
mind that I totally stole this UI for my custom

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:47.810
controls class.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.310
I don't know if you saw that.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.480
&gt;&gt; TAN: No, I didn't actually see that, but
that's cool.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480
We like--we like to hear that.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.480
I mean...

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.263
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I remember that you guys
came in to show us this...

00:02:54.263 --> 00:02:55.263
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So nice.

00:02:55.263 --> 00:02:58.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...when I--I think it was actually
pre-Honeycomb watch.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think it was.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.010
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And we were having some problems
because, you know, of course that was a new

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.240
GPU for everybody.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240
&gt;&gt; TAN: Right.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And there were some--there were
some issues.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.810
We couldn't get our hardware accelerate at
the normal canvas and it wasn't working quite

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:13.810
fast enough.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.220
And, you know, we looked at it, it wasn't
buttery smooth and you guys really wanted

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.560
to be really super smooth.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.480
And so we--I think we ended up recommending
that you draw it on its own hardware layer.

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.480
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.480
No, definitely.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.982
I mean that was--this screen right here, this
mini by category screen is kind of that one

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.500
thing that we want to get right.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.250
We wanted to make sure that interact with
your finances was kind of this very immersive

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.910
experience and that buttery smooth, you know,
rotation of the screen just clicking on or

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:43.880
tapping on the slices, even slowing down to
kind of, you know, move between the slices.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.430
We wanted to get that 100% right, and that
was just something that we poured a lot of

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.430
effort and a lot of time into.

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.430
So...

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's really nice.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.430
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.430
Yeah.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It really gives that feeling that
this is an app that--it feels solid.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.430
&gt;&gt; TAN: Right.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.430
&gt;&gt; TAN: Uh-hmm.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's like there's no jankiness,
there's no, "Oh, I can see what they tried

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.430
to do there."

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.430
It just kind of works exactly as you'd hope
it does.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.430
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.751
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You can see--one thing that may
not come out in the video but, something that

00:04:05.751 --> 00:04:12.140
really impressed us and really made it run
slower is there's a really light gradient

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:13.380
all the way around here.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.760
And, you know, we talk a lot about gradients.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: In [INDISTINCT] there are some
design guides belonging to our competitors

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.699
that emphasize gradients in a way that we
find less Androidy.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.699
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.740
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But this is a great use of gradients.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.960
It's a wonderful--it's--you wouldn't even
know it's there if it wasn't pointed out to

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.550
you; but it makes the whole thing feel a little
deeper, a little more...

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.550
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...lifelike.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.440
And of course it slowed down rendering because
the gradients at that time were done in software.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.490
But once you rendered that all out onto one
layer, then you can rotate the layer without

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.959
actually having to redraw all the gradients
every time.

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:51.959
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:55.639
I mean, you know, our designers are very thankful
that you noticed the gradient.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.639
I'm thankful of it.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:00.330
I mean, again, it's just one of those things
that, you know, in addition to the interaction

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.619
piece and getting that right.

00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:02.619
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:06.349
&gt;&gt; TAN: You know the visual aspect, the colors,
the gradients and even kind of the blend of

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:10.339
the colors, you know, we spent a lot of time
on that and we're very, very proud of it.

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:11.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Well, it's one of those big challenges.

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.360
I mean it seems funny; like, it's such a deceptively
simple screen that we're looking at here.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.360
It's a simple pie.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.490
Well, doing that chart, you know, with a simple
sort of explanation of what each thing represents,

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:23.870
but it's all of those little things.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.779
Like I have--I think anyone who's done any
kind of engineering for any amount of time

00:05:27.779 --> 00:05:30.490
has built charting controls from scratch because
it's like databases.

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.490
&gt;&gt; TAN: Right.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:35.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's a requirement of every job
you ever do to start from the beginning.

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.710
And even simple things like choosing what
colors you're going to have because you don't

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.330
necessarily know how many categories you're
going to have.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.330
So, it's a pseudo-random color generator but
you need to make sure that each one is noticeable

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.520
and that they look well together and, you
know, I think that attention to detail really

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
was worth it.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.229
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and even making it a doughnut
instead of a pie.

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.229
I think...

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:53.229
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.539
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And I don't know if this is what
you had in mind, but it feels like that gives

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.840
me a clue that I'm going to interact with
it instead of just looking at it.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.840
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But it looks like one of those spinning
wheels, you know.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:04.169
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.169
You know, like the Wheel of Fortune.

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:06.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:07.169
Yeah.

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:08.169
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:09.169
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Like that's the--that's the one
thing that, you know, when I did my version,

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.939
I had to add in was the, you know, the ability
to [MAKES NOISE].

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:11.939
So, I just...

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:12.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And we're spending money along the...

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:13.939
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:14.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Awesome fitness.

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:15.939
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Make it spin faster and faster.

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:16.939
Yeah.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:17.939
Great.

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:18.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:19.939
All right.

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:20.939
So, I guess the two questions I had.

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:26.229
So, the first one is, so you already had a
phone app and a website before you had the

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:27.669
tablet app.

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:31.759
What would you say is sort of the biggest
change that you've made in order to make something

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:36.189
which was really a great tablet experience
as opposed to the--to the phone version and

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.839
sort of, you know, more than that, what were
the results or, you know, what did you do

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:45.089
and how has that affected your install rate
or your engagement to or any of those sorts

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:46.089
of things?

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:47.089
&gt;&gt; TAN: Right.

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:48.490
So, you know, when we first developed the
tablet app, as you said, we had a phone app

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:49.490
already.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.720
And, you know, we weren't 100% sure kind of
where folks would fall in terms of how they

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720
would use both apps.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.060
So, we said let's release a basic version
of the tablet app and then let's kind of get

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.569
some data and let's iterate against that.

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:00.569
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:02.639
&gt;&gt; TAN: And so, one of the things that we
started to find with the tablet app is that

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:05.960
people were actually spending more time on
the tablet app.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.689
Basically, they're sitting there they're looking
back at their finances and they're also looking

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:11.689
forward into their finances.

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:13.399
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So as you said, the analysis and
plan?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.399
&gt;&gt; TAN: Exactly.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.729
Whereas on the phone, it's kind of like this
decision maker.

00:07:16.729 --> 00:07:20.249
You know like, you might be at the store and
you might decide should I really buy this

00:07:20.249 --> 00:07:21.249
TV?

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:23.409
And you pop open this thing and figure out
yes, I can, right?

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:25.639
&gt;&gt; MEIER: How much is in my consumer electronics
budget for this?

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:26.639
&gt;&gt; TAN: Right.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.639
Exactly.

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:31.229
And then so, we started to move down that
route of empowering the user on the tablet

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.499
to do things like, you know, editing budgets
and doing split transactions and just being

00:07:35.499 --> 00:07:41.499
able to do more in terms of really kind of
setting their financial foundation and, you

00:07:41.499 --> 00:07:44.579
know, looking back at their data and making
sure it's kind of jiving with what they think.

00:07:44.579 --> 00:07:45.579
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:07:45.579 --> 00:07:50.340
&gt;&gt; TAN: So, you know, our analogy is our phone
app is basically a snacking app; like, throughout

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:54.469
the day you're popping peanuts or you're,
you know, eating, you know, candy bars and

00:07:54.469 --> 00:07:55.469
whatnot.

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:56.469
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:58.099
&gt;&gt; TAN: And then with the tablet app, it's
basically like a full meal.

00:07:58.099 --> 00:08:02.479
You sit down and you'll kind of digest the
overview and then you'll, you know, go deeper

00:08:02.479 --> 00:08:04.939
into budgets and you start editing your budgets
and things of that sort.

00:08:04.939 --> 00:08:06.139
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I like that.

00:08:06.139 --> 00:08:07.240
That's a--that's a nice analogy.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:11.149
So, if I understand that correctly, so you're
actually--are you actually putting your spending

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:12.590
into the app as you're spending it?

00:08:12.590 --> 00:08:16.509
And so if you're out at the shops, you're
actually putting that budgetary information

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:18.459
in via the phone app?

00:08:18.459 --> 00:08:19.459
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:08:19.459 --> 00:08:22.149
So, basically on your tablet app, you can
go and set your budgets, you can edit your

00:08:22.149 --> 00:08:25.240
budgets and then when you have your phone
app, you know, that very same budget that

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.460
you've set, you can clearly see how much money
you've got left...

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:28.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yes.

00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.351
&gt;&gt; TAN: ...for this particular month and then
you can dive deeper into the various, you

00:08:31.351 --> 00:08:33.020
know, subcategories and whatnot.

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:36.349
And then, you know, conversely when you're
on your phone, you can enter transactions

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:37.599
on the go and on the fly.

00:08:37.599 --> 00:08:38.599
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:08:38.599 --> 00:08:40.370
&gt;&gt; TAN: And then when you get home, you know,
you can see them showing up on your table.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:41.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:42.370
Yeah.

00:08:42.370 --> 00:08:43.370
&gt;&gt; TAN: And then you can go in and do a little
bit more if you wanted to.

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:44.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:45.800
You can find out what punishment you've done
to your budgets...

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:46.800
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...on your phone when you get back
home.

00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:49.030
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:50.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's nice.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:54.880
So, does that mean that the tablet app; is
that something that's sort of a feature for

00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:56.870
feature equivalent of what you can do on the
website?

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.300
Do you just sort of see that in the future
as sort of becoming more and more the way

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.570
that maybe people are going to be using the
app?

00:09:02.570 --> 00:09:03.570
[INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; TAN: Definitely.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:04.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...of problem with it.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.170
&gt;&gt; TAN: I mean, you know, you kind of hit
the nail on the head in terms of, you know,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.020
we've got a website; we've got a tablet and
we've got a phone.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.630
You know, where the tablet sit in between
and it's looking more and more like, you know,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.949
it may kind of replace the Web.

00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:17.680
I mean, it kind of, you know, what--so we're
bringing some of those more Web-like features

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.940
to the tablet and then we'll keep the phone
to be very simple, very decision-oriented

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:25.509
or kind of enter information-oriented and
then on the tablet, you can do your analysis.

00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:26.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:29.089
I mean that's, I think, something which we
go on about quite a bit, which is the idea

00:09:29.089 --> 00:09:32.709
that on a--on a phone, you really want to
have almost a single action.

00:09:32.709 --> 00:09:33.709
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yup.

00:09:33.709 --> 00:09:36.620
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sort of you open it up and there's
sort one or two steps to do whatever it is

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:37.620
you want to do.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.709
Check to see whether I can but this thing
or, you know, basically enter the information

00:09:40.709 --> 00:09:42.399
that I have for this thing.

00:09:42.399 --> 00:09:43.399
&gt;&gt; TAN: Right.

00:09:43.399 --> 00:09:46.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Whereas on the tablet, you are expecting
people to sit down and spend a bit more time,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.040
so you can have a little bit more of a complex
work for them...

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.040
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...or have more complex actions
to take.

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.040
And our data tells us exactly that.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.040
I mean, you know to the point about snacking
and dining.

00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:59.360
I mean, on the tablet app, you know, we see
most people hopping into the app at about

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.600
8:00, you know, after 8:00 PM.

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.600
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You're right.

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.709
&gt;&gt; TAN: And that's when our usage spikes,
between 8:00 and 10:00.

00:10:03.709 --> 00:10:04.709
So, you know...

00:10:04.709 --> 00:10:05.709
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:10:05.709 --> 00:10:07.730
&gt;&gt; TAN: ...maybe folks put the kids down to
bed and then they pick up Mint for, you know,

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:09.959
or maybe they're in bed talking with their
wife or husband or whatnot about their finances.

00:10:09.959 --> 00:10:12.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We really need this TV and look
we can make it work.

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:13.610
&gt;&gt; TAN: Exactly.

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I can see that.

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:15.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Nice.

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's cool.

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:18.730
And so, did you see then--obviously you've
got a lot of analytics which is, again, something

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.529
which we tell people that they need to do.

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:23.899
You know, you need to understand what impact
the decisions you're making about your app

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:25.350
has on its usage.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:29.380
So, did you see as you were sort of adding
more of that dining experience to tablet that

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.540
you're usage was increasing?

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:31.540
&gt;&gt; TAN: Yeah, definitely.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:36.910
I mean we've seen, you know, a fair amount
of usage in terms of just, you know, installs

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:37.910
with the app.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.139
And then just in terms of, you know overall
time spent in the app.

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:42.139
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, great.

00:10:42.139 --> 00:10:47.390
&gt;&gt; Tan: You know I believe the number was
in the magnitude of 25% more time on the app...

00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:48.390
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Wow.

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.390
&gt;&gt; TAN: ...you know, versus on the phone.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:53.529
So, you know, again big thing for us, you
know, to know that and to kind of make that

00:10:53.529 --> 00:10:55.129
decision and go down that path.

00:10:55.129 --> 00:10:56.180
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:10:56.180 --> 00:11:00.450
That sounds like a--that sounds like a lot
of thought and effort has gone into every

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:03.970
aspect of this, which is really great to see
and you can see that from polished effect.

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:04.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Definitely.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It--the other thing I want to point
out as well because we had Mint, I think was

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.490
one of the nominees for one of our app clinics
a while back but we didn't spend much time

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.449
on it because A, it was already great and
B, we didn't have a demo account to log into.

00:11:17.449 --> 00:11:18.449
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:11:18.449 --> 00:11:21.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But, you know, one thing I want
to highlight for people watching is that this

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.010
is an app that looks very much like Mint.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:26.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It doesn't--it doesn't look a lot
like hollow.

00:11:26.990 --> 00:11:29.269
It's got more gradients than we would usually
expect to see.

00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:30.269
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:31.329
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Things like these reflections.

00:11:31.329 --> 00:11:32.329
But it really works.

00:11:32.329 --> 00:11:33.329
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, yeah.

00:11:33.329 --> 00:11:35.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, I think that's something
which we spend a lot of time telling people

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:38.800
like sometimes you can watch our show and
think we're basically saying make every app

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.319
look like it should be a native app like,
you know, that is shipped with the fun.

00:11:43.319 --> 00:11:44.319
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:45.350
Make everything flat.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:47.350
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Flat.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:48.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Flat, nothing.

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:51.529
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And to be fair, Roman Newark
does say that.

00:11:51.529 --> 00:11:56.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But this is a really good example
of going the whole way.

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.110
So it's like...

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:58.110
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it doesn't have to be that.

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:01.010
This still looks consistent with Android;
it looks like it belongs on this device.

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:02.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:04.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But it does look different to some
of the native apps which shipped with it.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:05.410
And I think...

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:06.410
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:12:06.410 --> 00:12:08.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it really just comes down to
having this holistic design that fits everything

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:09.790
in.

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.870
You know, you've got this action bar which
looks like legitimate action bar; I mean it

00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:13.870
is.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:14.870
You've got...

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:16.870
It works right.

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:17.870
Everything, everything is in the right place.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:18.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:19.870
If I want to...

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:20.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's where you expect it to be.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:21.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...do something, I can refresh;
I know here I've I got, you know, the compose

00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:22.970
icon meaning, you know, to add something in.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:23.970
It's all intuitive.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:24.970
It all works...

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:25.970
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:12:25.970 --> 00:12:26.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...the way I would expect.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.810
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And nothing--now, I have--I don't
think I've seen every nook and cranny of this

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:32.810
app.

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:34.310
But just as I--as I played with it, this is
probably the fourth or fifth time I've had

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:37.730
a chance to sit down and play with it.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:41.809
What's really impressive is that nothing feels
stitched on.

00:12:41.809 --> 00:12:42.809
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:45.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: There's never that point that
we get to with a lot of other apps where we

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.379
say, "Oh, this is where they ran out of time
and stopped."

00:12:47.379 --> 00:12:50.130
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And this is where the designers
also run out in the develop point, "Oh, you

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:51.360
know, what I could do?"

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.009
And you can see that they've solved a lot
of difficult technical problems.

00:12:55.009 --> 00:12:56.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:12:56.009 --> 00:12:57.009
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Look.

00:12:57.009 --> 00:12:58.100
This is a--this is a buttery smooth thing,
I don't know if you noticed but there's a

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.310
little fade out gradient...

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.310
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I did notice that, yeah.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:03.149
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...at the top there which--actually,
you know, isn't--in fact, I will say that

00:13:03.149 --> 00:13:06.490
a couple of versions ago, there were some
devices where we had to take that gradient

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.319
out because we couldn't make our GPU code
run fast enough.

00:13:10.319 --> 00:13:15.009
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's--this is really a good example
actually of using the inspiration of hollow

00:13:15.009 --> 00:13:17.949
and of the Android theming and applying it
within your own app.

00:13:17.949 --> 00:13:20.610
Because we, you know, we have something similar
with this when you get to the top and bottom

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:21.690
of a ListView.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:25.790
And this clearly isn't a ListView, but it
still has that same hinting as to there's

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.890
more up, you know.

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:27.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:28.890
Exactly.

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:29.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So it's really nice.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yup.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:31.890
All right.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:32.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:33.890
All right.

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:34.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So I think we've probably spend
enough time on Mint.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.890
So thank you very for coming in...

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:37.890
&gt;&gt; TAN: Sure.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...and joining us and talk a little
bit about the product.

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:39.890
We should get some other guys a chance.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:40.890
So...

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:41.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Absolutely.

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:42.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...let's move on to TinyCo.

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:43.890
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Indeed.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:44.890
One of my--one of my...

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:46.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Can you guys hear us and see us
all right?

00:13:46.299 --> 00:13:47.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS:...favorites.

00:13:47.299 --> 00:13:48.299
And there's a chair for you right on there.

00:13:48.299 --> 00:13:49.299
&gt;&gt; TAN: Oh, cool.

00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:50.299
Oh.

00:13:50.299 --> 00:13:51.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Hey guys.

00:13:51.299 --> 00:13:52.299
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Hi.

00:13:52.299 --> 00:13:53.299
How are you?

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hey, hey.

00:13:54.299 --> 00:13:55.299
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I'm very well.

00:13:55.299 --> 00:13:56.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Good to see you.

00:13:56.299 --> 00:13:57.939
We're going to shift over around here because...

00:13:57.939 --> 00:13:58.939
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:13:58.939 --> 00:14:02.439
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...we don't have any high tech
where--we need like a little chair carousel.

00:14:02.439 --> 00:14:03.439
That would be awesome.

00:14:03.439 --> 00:14:04.439
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, no.

00:14:04.439 --> 00:14:06.899
We need like a trapdoor because we're on--we're
on the second floor.

00:14:06.899 --> 00:14:07.899
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's true.

00:14:07.899 --> 00:14:08.899
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I guess because we're in the US.

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:10.819
I suggest lower people out and lower them
back in.

00:14:10.819 --> 00:14:11.819
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly.

00:14:11.819 --> 00:14:12.819
As long...

00:14:12.819 --> 00:14:13.819
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And then we'll just [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...as we're making an 80k project,

00:14:13.819 --> 00:14:15.079
we can expense it.

00:14:15.079 --> 00:14:16.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:14:16.790 --> 00:14:18.120
So first question.

00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:19.300
TinyCo, yes?

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.410
Not Tiny Company?

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.809
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yes, TinyCo.

00:14:21.809 --> 00:14:22.809
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Excellent.

00:14:22.809 --> 00:14:24.730
That's probably a good choice.

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:26.949
So apologies for mangling your company name.

00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:27.949
&gt;&gt; MAHER: That's all right.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:29.180
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Do you want to introduce yourself?

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:31.049
And tell us a little bit about TinyCo.

00:14:31.049 --> 00:14:32.049
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Sure.

00:14:32.049 --> 00:14:33.810
I'm Sean Maher.

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.730
I'm one of the mobile developers here.

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.889
We make mobile games.

00:14:38.889 --> 00:14:45.379
Most of them are premium games with in app
purchase and yeah, we've been moving everything

00:14:45.379 --> 00:14:51.100
that we can onto the Android store and trying
to support as many devices as possible including

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:52.120
the tablets.

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Outstanding.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.689
So let's say, so we've installed Tiny Monsters,
I think...

00:14:56.689 --> 00:14:57.689
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:14:57.689 --> 00:14:58.689
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...you know, on the device.

00:14:58.689 --> 00:14:59.689
Do you--we've got it up on screen.

00:14:59.689 --> 00:15:02.189
Do you want to tell us a little a bit about
the game?

00:15:02.189 --> 00:15:06.470
Perhaps, you know--it looks great on tablets
and maybe talk a little bit about the tablet

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.800
aspects and any differences that this may
have with the phone version.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.800
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Sure.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:12.800
Yeah.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:17.399
I mean we pictured that people would be using
the tablet version, you know, maybe at their

00:15:17.399 --> 00:15:21.709
desks; but probably on their couch or in bed
or something like that.

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:27.180
We definitely knew that people wanted to get
a bigger and better view of their island.

00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:32.460
For anyone who hasn't played the game, you
have your own island that you decorate and

00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:38.189
buy habitats in and then you hatch and raise
different monsters and then crossbreed them.

00:15:38.189 --> 00:15:39.189
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:42.660
&gt;&gt; MAHER: But we wanted to make sure that
people got as big and as clear a view of the

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:44.309
island as possible.

00:15:44.309 --> 00:15:49.720
So we took advantage of the full side of the--size
of the screen and we made sure that we had

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:55.279
high resolution assets for all of the buildings,
all of the monsters...

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.279
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:15:56.279 --> 00:15:57.279
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...everything that people would
be seeing.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.509
&gt;&gt; MEIER: The assets look fantastic, I think.

00:15:58.509 --> 00:15:59.509
It's only...

00:15:59.509 --> 00:16:00.509
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yeah.

00:16:00.509 --> 00:16:02.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...the first thing that I noticed
like you got the full screen experience with

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:06.269
the--sort of the chrome, the game chrome is
big enough without being too big.

00:16:06.269 --> 00:16:09.930
So it doesn't look like it's being stretched
but it's all big enough to touch and the assets

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:11.720
just look gorgeous, really crisp.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.940
You guys have come such a long way since.

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:22.050
I remember when we first got in touch, you
guys were working on--was it Tap Resort or

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.109
the--this little island game?

00:16:24.109 --> 00:16:25.109
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yes.

00:16:25.109 --> 00:16:26.109
Yeah.

00:16:26.109 --> 00:16:27.109
That would have been Tap Resort.

00:16:27.109 --> 00:16:28.109
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:16:28.109 --> 00:16:32.240
And that was--the first thing that we noticed
was, you know, the assets didn't' scale very

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.680
well and there were just, you know, lot of
things would come over from phone.

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.819
And I remember we sat down and talked to you
about, you know, the different, you know,

00:16:40.819 --> 00:16:42.750
form factors in Android and it took a while.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:43.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.271
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: But it seems like you guys really
took that to heart.

00:16:46.271 --> 00:16:51.160
I mean didn't you go back and basically you
wrote a cross platform engine which works

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160
really well.

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.510
You were able to get great performance out
of it.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:59.019
But most importantly you've got this images
that look...

00:16:59.019 --> 00:17:00.019
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Wow.

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:01.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...just fantastic even with this
really high zoom places.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:02.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:03.370
It's zoomed...

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:04.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm very, very impressed with
that.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...in here.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480
This looks fantastic.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.480
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.480
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yeah.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.180
We did--we were originally with the older
game that you were talking about.

00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:15.490
We were porting our apps and essentially had
two different code bases running but...

00:17:15.490 --> 00:17:16.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Always fun.

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:19.920
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...when we started to take this
very seriously, we knew that we needed a cross

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.070
platform engine which we wrote and probably
one of the biggest challenges was how were

00:17:25.070 --> 00:17:30.350
we going to deal with all these different
aspect to ratios and--because we knew that

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.510
we were--we were now dealing with more than
one screen size and just stretching everything

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:36.390
wasn't going to cut it.

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:41.870
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, one thing I do remember
too is that, you know, that we had a talk

00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:48.260
and I think you actually, if I remember right,
had an excellent blog post about just how

00:17:48.260 --> 00:17:55.220
you were able to grow your revenue by concentrating
on treating andler--Android like Android instead

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:00.600
of porting from some other platform that didn't
have the same benefits and challenges.

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.600
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Right, yeah.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.250
It has been a whole different--it's a whole
different ecosystem and different strategies

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.600
have worked well for us.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:12.270
I'm a coder, so I'm not--I probably can't
speak too much to the--to the financial side

00:18:12.270 --> 00:18:13.340
of things.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:19.650
But we have treated each platform--on the
engineering side, it's all fairly unified.

00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:22.840
But the monetization strategies are very different
on each ecosystem.

00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's interesting.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.080
You know, given that you are on the engineering
side, I'd like to dig a little bit deeper

00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:32.540
if possible to find out, you know, what was
some of the techniques that you used to get

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:36.450
past the--that challenge that you said of
all the different aspect ratios and screen

00:18:36.450 --> 00:18:40.770
sizes, so is that something that you can share
with some of the developers watching to--and

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:43.730
probably facing a lot those same issues.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:44.950
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Sure.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:45.950
Sure.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:46.950
Absolutely.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:49.570
Like a lot of games, we are using the Endeca.

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:52.370
We're writing the bulk of our game code in
C++.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:53.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:57.460
&gt;&gt; MAHER: And the--look, like I said, right
out of the game, we knew we needed to deal

00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:02.860
with this--not so much the screen size issue,
but the aspect ratio issue.

00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yes.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.300
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Some devices are extremely wide-screened.

00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:14.450
Others are taller, you know, than the standard,
you know, the four by three phone aspect ratio.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:18.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I've seen a lot of games which have
sort of the black bars along the side to say

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:20.130
it...

00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:21.130
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:23.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...really is four three, trust me.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.240
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Right.

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240
Yeah.

00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.460
We don't--we don't pretend that it's four
three.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:32.410
We actually--so since we're using the native
development kit, we're not using a lot of

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:37.860
the built-in Android features for scaling
and whatnot.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.580
We look at the raw number of pixels on the
screen...

00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:41.580
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.730
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...and based on that decide how
much we're going to have to scale the UI elements

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:48.160
and the game elements.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.040
Beyond that, we do have high-resolution assets
that we use.

00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:57.280
If we do decide we need to scale a button
to twice its original size, we used a double

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.110
size art asset for that.

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:01.900
So it doesn't look blurry like it...

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:02.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:04.820
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...would be if you just--if you
just scaled it up without using a larger asset.

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:06.800
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's a really interesting point.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:12.040
Do you make that decision initially based
on the screen size which assets you'll load

00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.680
or do you actually make it on an asset by
asset basis trying to determine how much it's

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.950
going to scale?

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:22.100
&gt;&gt; MAHER: We don't do the--second technique
you're talking about would be like level of

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.240
detail based on...

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.080
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...how big it is, decide which asset
to use.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.100
We don't do that.

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:31.670
We decide based on the raw number of pixels
in the display.

00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.419
We think we're going to need, you know, single
size assets or double size assets.

00:20:35.419 --> 00:20:37.680
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: So do you bucket them--I'm really
curious.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.840
Do you bucket them the same way we do or do
you have a different scheme?

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:48.010
&gt;&gt; MAHER: I'm not sure if you--I know in the
standard Android STK there's a number of folders

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:52.150
for medium resolution and high resolution
and things like that.

00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:57.360
We have what we call just the single resolution,
the one X and the double resolution, the two

00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:58.360
X.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.360
We're not using other...

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Okay.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:01.360
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...intermediate sizes.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Got you.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That probably makes sense; and in
fact we've...

00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...we've actually found that for
most cases, that actually works pretty well.

00:21:06.030 --> 00:21:07.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:10.820
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Like it's not always necessary even
when you're using the STK, to use each of

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.820
those buckets.

00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:15.400
And in fact when you have, you know, just
providing something very high res which can

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.320
then scale back works pretty well until we
get to the point where you almost needed a

00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.900
different style asset to work at the reduced
resolution.

00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.900
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.060
Of course you're also doing some quite fancy
scaling work here.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:29.060
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:30.180
It has some sort of zooming in...

00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:31.180
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Or actually...

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.540
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...on the--on the world.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.080
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:41.150
We're zooming in and out; and is that just
a set of mipmap textures or do you--do you...

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:44.040
&gt;&gt; MAHER: We're actually--we're not using
mipmaps, we're just...

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-huh.

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:47.450
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...using the single--the single
high resolution texture.

00:21:47.450 --> 00:21:52.120
That's why you can zoom in as far as you are
so that a single building feels like the entire

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.120
screen.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.120
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Wow.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.360
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Because we are using those high
resolution textures.

00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:57.440
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yeah.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:01.470
Mipmaps are really nice for scaling but of
course they use a lot more memory.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.470
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.700
&gt;&gt; MAHER: And we are still somewhat memory
constrained.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.000
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's really interesting.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Politically correct.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I would--well, I would actually
be very interested to know how that affects

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.940
your performance because typically, you know,
what we'll see is, Mint maps will take up

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.310
more room and memory obviously.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.710
But they'll also...

00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:21.690
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Render faster.

00:22:21.690 --> 00:22:25.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Exactly because they're--they
eat less GPU bandwidth on the way in, right?

00:22:25.860 --> 00:22:26.860
So...

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:27.860
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Sure.

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.360
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I'm actually really surprised
that you're able to get this frame rate with

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:33.720
nothing but full resolution samples.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.170
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Right.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.610
Well, we were--we just--we've always been
more constrained by memory than we were by

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:43.010
CPU and draw speed.

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:47.299
That may be because we don't have millions
of triangles on the--on the screen.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.310
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: That's a good point.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:51.140
&gt;&gt; MAHER: But for us, for the kind of games
that we're making right now.

00:22:51.140 --> 00:22:57.289
It made more sense to use less memory and
take the hit to the draw speed.

00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:58.289
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Got you.

00:22:58.289 --> 00:22:59.289
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, totally.

00:22:59.289 --> 00:23:02.720
It just looks really smooth, so I think that's
really a good choice.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.010
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And I love the graphics, like all
of the graphics look fantastic.

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:12.490
And if we're all of the--even just the style
itself and sort of the faces from the people

00:23:12.490 --> 00:23:14.290
who pop up and congratulate you and stuff,
it's just...

00:23:14.290 --> 00:23:15.720
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh yeah, absolutely,
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It looks like a lot of fun.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, I remember, I was actually
in the pitch meeting when you guys came and

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:20.870
showed this to us the first time.

00:23:20.870 --> 00:23:26.640
And we'd actually just reviewed a whole set
of very, very similar games but this still

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.640
really blew us away.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:29.630
That, you know kudos to your artist.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:30.630
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Well, thank you.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.100
Yeah, I can't take credit for that.

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:35.160
We have some amazing artists and some amazing
UI people.

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.850
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:37.850
So I was going to ask him.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:41.890
And you may not be--you may not be the right
person on the team to speak to this but I'll

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:43.930
ask anyway just in case.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:48.210
Having, you know, really build this excellent
experience on tablet, do you--have you found

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.470
any significant difference in terms of user
engagement?

00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:55.450
And I mean, frankly you guys have an app which,
you know, is paid.

00:23:55.450 --> 00:24:01.280
So if you found that you're making comparatively
more money on users who are using it on tablet

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280
devices?

00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yeah, I don't.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.550
I don't have access to the monetization numbers.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:10.910
But I do know that the percentage of our users
who are playing on a tablet has been definitely

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.910
been going up...

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:12.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Good.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.910
&gt;&gt; MAHER: ...over time.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.970
And it's--we definitely take that into consideration
when planning new features, because we know

00:24:17.970 --> 00:24:20.140
that that's where a lot of our users want
to play, on a tablet.

00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:22.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:26.840
You know if you click the games like this
which sort of more than to just I've got five

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.290
minutes while I'm waiting for my bus.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:32.870
It's more like, okay; I've got an hour or
two to spend gaming now, whether that's on

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.420
a train or at home or wherever else.

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.929
So, you know, for that experience, I think
tablets are just fantastic.

00:24:36.929 --> 00:24:40.610
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Well, and especially when you
want that really beautiful immersive graphical

00:24:40.610 --> 00:24:41.610
experience.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:42.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, absolutely.

00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:44.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And this, you know, you can see
very similar graphics on a phone but they

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.930
just won't blow you away like they do here.

00:24:46.930 --> 00:24:47.930
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:56.040
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I know that I--publicly you guys
have said a few things about how Android was

00:24:56.040 --> 00:25:04.750
very disappointing at first for TinyCo but
as we--as we worked with you and as you started

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.240
to see the Android ecosystem as a separate
thing.

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.800
Especially, you know, being able to take advantage
of things like different aspect ratios, different

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:20.420
sized devices, in a way that made the users
of each device happy.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:26.340
Then, you know, apparently and this is--again
what you guys said in your blog post, the

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.179
monetization just steadily climbed...

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:30.179
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's right.

00:25:30.179 --> 00:25:32.010
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...and got much, much better.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.630
And I don't know where it's at now.

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:37.800
That was--I think the last year is when you
guys were saying that.

00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.230
Actually before this game even came out but...

00:25:40.230 --> 00:25:42.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But it's great to see that it's...

00:25:42.030 --> 00:25:43.030
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Hopefully it's convenient.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:44.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, you'd like to think so.

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:47.720
The very least I think if we're seeing, you
know, apps or games of this sort of quality

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.980
and you guys are still investing your resources
to create them for tablets, that's probably

00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.980
a good sign.

00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: You know, holy crap, they got
clouds and everything.

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:53.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:54.980
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's awesome.

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I was wondering what those things
were, it's clouds.

00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:56.980
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Yeah, right.

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:57.980
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's just cool.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:25:58.980
All right.

00:25:58.980 --> 00:25:59.980
Well, we've--we spent a bunch of time on this.

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.630
We should give a little bit of a chance to
Instapaper to speak as well.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:03.630
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, absolutely.

00:26:03.630 --> 00:26:05.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Thank you very much for joining
us and thank you...

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:06.190
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Thank you.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:07.190
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...for creating an awesome looking
game.

00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:08.690
&gt;&gt; MAHER: Thank you guys.

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:11.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: All right.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.630
Let's move on.

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:17.640
Such a nice little animation you got going
there, Ian, very impressed.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:19.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's almost like magic...

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:20.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It...

00:26:20.250 --> 00:26:21.250
&gt;&gt;&gt;NI-LEWIS: The way it moves.

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:22.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It is almost like...

00:26:22.250 --> 00:26:23.250
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:26:23.250 --> 00:26:24.250
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it's moving magically.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:26.850
So, the last app that we wanted to talk about
today was Instapaper.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.240
So hopefully we've got the Instapaper guys
on the line, hi guys.

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.870
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Hey, how you doing?

00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:32.870
&gt;&gt; EMERICK: Hey.

00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:33.870
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Pretty good.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:35.030
Thank you for bearing with us and hanging
around.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.280
We're hopefully saving the best to the last.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.120
No offense to our friend who's just gone before.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.580
It's best to get them out of the room.

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:44.660
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.750
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Awkward.

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:49.500
So please introduce yourselves, tell us a
little bit about the company, the app.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.500
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Sure.

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:52.450
So, our company is called Mobelux.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.020
My name is Jeff Rock, I'm co-founder.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.590
I'm here with Jason Emerick who's our lead
Android developer.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:05.710
So Mobelux, we make apps for IOS, the Mac,
Android, pretty much anywhere there's a screen.

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:06.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:12.660
&gt;&gt; ROCK: A lot of our business is building
white label apps for other companies and startups.

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:17.420
So Tumblr, we built their 1st and 2nd generation
Android client.

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:18.420
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:22.530
&gt;&gt; ROCK: We built iHomes, Android client for
their alarm clock.

00:27:22.530 --> 00:27:27.390
We built other apps for Random House and some
other guys out there on the store.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:32.090
You just--you may not see our name but we
have a lot of people using our apps everyday.

00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:33.210
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.370
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: It's in business.

00:27:34.370 --> 00:27:37.430
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And they've never seen the--they've
never seen 90, probably used one of your apps.

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:39.030
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yup.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:41.740
We--this arrangement was a little different.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:46.080
We're real good friends with Marco Arment
and he came to us and said, "Look, I just

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:50.330
simply don't have the resources to devote
to Android development.

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:52.880
And I know you guys do this stuff."

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:58.271
And he was interested in seeing if we would
build it under our name because he felt like

00:27:58.271 --> 00:28:01.690
Instapaper would really shine on Android tablets.

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:07.990
So, we took it over and we developed the Android
code base from scratch.

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.990
We maintained it.

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:13.070
We worked closely with Marco on the features
we're going to implement time on.

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:14.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:18.370
&gt;&gt; ROCK: But it is very much a Mobelux/Instapaper
production.

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.480
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool, very cool.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.330
So he came to you guys specifically because
you've got that experience with Android and

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:29.530
sort of understand how to build an app which
is sort of a pure Android experience, is that

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:30.530
right?

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.640
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, I think we're all--especially--Mobelux
in particular and Marco and he feels this

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:35.640
way too.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:41.970
We really--we loathe that the kind of write
once, run anywhere frameworks.

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.750
We don't--in our experience, we've never seen
any of those do it particularly really well.

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.029
And I've never heard of anyone that loved
them once they used them, so.

00:28:50.029 --> 00:28:52.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, and that's what we've [INDISTINCT]
&gt;&gt; ROCK: We're pretty finicky about being

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:55.210
native for the platform, done the way it's
supposed to be done.

00:28:55.210 --> 00:28:58.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, I think that's when it comes
down to me and those write once, run anywhere

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:00.240
type platforms are a great idea?

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.690
And I'd be hugely supportive of them if they
produced awesome apps, which I couldn't tell

00:29:04.690 --> 00:29:08.230
were built on the write once, you know, run
anywhere type platform.

00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:09.230
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:10.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the
case.

00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:14.590
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: And every time I've ever, you
know, encountered any sort of automatically

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.200
generated UIs, it's never good.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.710
So, you know, I think at the moment, it's
definitely the way to go is to really try

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.350
and build something that is, you know, native
for each one.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:25.880
And that's the thing as well.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.690
People act as though it's a huge amount of
extra work.

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:30.610
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Sorry, we're losing you just a little
bit, can you say...

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:31.610
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's all right.

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:36.650
We're just basically talking amongst ourselves
but I see you guys are frozen on our screen

00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:37.650
as well.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.310
So we'll continue to talk amongst ourselves
until you unfreeze.

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:41.560
Oh, looks like they're back.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:42.560
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, good.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I can see some of it right now.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.240
&gt;&gt; ROCK: It's okay.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:47.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I can see on that corner.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Oh, great, great.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.910
Yeah, So I think people forget actually the
lessons of history.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:50.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.920
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Because if you can think about
even, you know, the first version of Microsoft

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.670
Office for Mac, for instance, and Office for
Mac, a lot of people don't realize is actually

00:29:57.670 --> 00:29:59.929
very profitable and...

00:29:59.929 --> 00:30:00.929
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:30:00.929 --> 00:30:02.220
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...well-respected product.

00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:05.480
But the first version was universally reviled
and it was mostly because they took their

00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.850
Windows product and plugged it...

00:30:06.850 --> 00:30:07.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: To the Mac.

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...directly on the Mac.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:09.860
You know, that's never going to fly...

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:10.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that's right.

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.860
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...right?

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:12.860
And it doesn't fly to go back the other way
either.

00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:13.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:15.270
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: I've had some, some things that
were obviously written for Mac on my Windows

00:30:15.270 --> 00:30:17.350
machine and they just don't jive right.

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.410
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So it's one of the little things,
it's like you hit a dropdown and the dropdown

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.180
in Mac and Windows is different.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:26.260
It's exactly the same functionality but it
looks different and it's that cognitive dissonance

00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.360
where you're like, wait, how do I select this?

00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.380
Oh, okay.

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.120
That slight little pause breaks you out of
that mindset of whatever it is that you were

00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:35.120
doing.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120
So you don't want to have to think about the
app.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.299
You just want to able to do whatever the app
lets you do.

00:30:38.299 --> 00:30:39.299
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Right.

00:30:39.299 --> 00:30:42.280
So respecting the platform and respecting
the user who chose...

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.280
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's really about the user.

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.280
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: ...to buy that platform.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's like you don't have to worry
about us, you know, we can take it but it's

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.770
about the users which you're trying to, you
know, leverage your app.

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:53.320
So we've got--we've got Instapaper up on the
screen.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:57.070
Can you tell us a little bit about the--the
way that you went about designing a tablet

00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:58.360
specific version of the app?

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:04.460
And sort of what are the have the key decisions
that you made and how that has affected usage

00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.970
of the app.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.490
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, absolutely.

00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:12.420
So I think unlike a lot of Android development,
we started with tablet primarily.

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.680
We actually designed out the seven inch and
ten inch layouts for tablets before we even

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.799
looked at the thumb-based layouts.

00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:19.799
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, that's interesting.

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:23.620
&gt;&gt; ROCK: We really felt like this was for
the people that read, you know, there's a

00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.450
lot of competition in the space now.

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:26.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.910
&gt;&gt; ROCK: For read it later style, you know,
consumption.

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:35.720
But Instapaper's really for reading and as
soon as we picked up a seven inch tablet we

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.830
really knew that was--that was a great place
to be.

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:44.780
We deploy on to Kindle as well with the same
layouts and Nook.

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.850
That was very important because we wanted
to get people that were buying primarily reading

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:56.600
devices as well as certain people in the--in
the Google Play Store that have these tablets.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.060
So, it was a pretty easy decision to make
once we held those tablets.

00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:07.460
That the phone would be a secondary place
to run Instapaper and most likely you're going

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:12.020
to want to sit down on your couch or lay in
bed and read on a nice, you know, tablet.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:15.160
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Just looking at it here, I can see
straight away what it reminds me of is my

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.160
Kindle.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.160
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.230
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, just a great experience
to being optimized for being able to read

00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:21.230
contents.

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.450
So it's a very simple display, very sparse.

00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:24.450
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yes.

00:32:24.450 --> 00:32:26.240
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Without being too small which I
think is important.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:27.240
&gt;&gt; NI-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.770
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, we really were focused on simplicity.

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:30.770
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:32.550
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Instapaper is not a complex interface.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:39.580
We have a lot of opportunities to create little
UI mechanisms that are fine or maybe a little

00:32:39.580 --> 00:32:40.870
overly complex.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:50.910
And we use this, you know, when we--for Instapaper
this--it really--the simplicity of the experience

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.539
is core, I think to that whole product.

00:32:53.539 --> 00:32:54.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, I totally agree.

00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:00.110
I think, you know, it's like you start up
the app and it almost looks and I say this

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.030
with respect, it almost looks a little boring.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.970
You know, you open it up and it's like, oh,
it's just bunch of things to read and then

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.900
you click them and there's articles to read.

00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:08.900
But that...

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:09.900
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Uh-hmm, yeah.

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:10.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think it's kind of a point, right?

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.440
There's no distraction, there's no oh, what
does this app do, how I do I use this?

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.440
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: What features are available?

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.440
And it's like...

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:20.550
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah, they do--yeah, there aren't
any crazy pop-ups or gigantic menus...

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:21.550
&gt;&gt; MEIER: None.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:22.550
It's just a bunch of stuff...

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:23.550
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...which is really...

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.840
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...that you've chosen to read and
provide it in a way for you--optimize for

00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.330
you to be able to read it, you know...

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.330
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.450
&gt;&gt; MEIER:...I love the fact that you can change
the fonts and the profile and everything else.

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:33.300
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: You know, the other thing that
I noticed about this design that I think is

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:38.020
really interesting is a lot of people--well,
almost everyone, I think that writes a tablet

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:46.090
app will start with a two column layout that's
a, you know, a master detail type of thing.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.470
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, so the navigation on your
left with, you know, detail on the right side

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:50.470
scenario.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:51.470
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Right.

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:55.340
And you guys did not do that you go with the
two columns if you--that's--it makes me think

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.340
of a newspaper...

00:33:56.340 --> 00:33:57.370
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, very much.

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:58.980
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...and I think that's very effective...

00:33:58.980 --> 00:33:59.980
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yup.

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:00.980
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...it's a really interesting
layout.

00:34:00.980 --> 00:34:04.530
&gt;&gt; ROCK: And so that's just goes to that same
tenet and we believe that the content is king

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.530
in Instapaper...

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:06.530
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:34:06.530 --> 00:34:11.650
&gt;&gt; ROCK: ...and we want to give you as much
content without, you know, we're not just

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:17.550
space filling here, we put two columns up
so that you could see the--the most recent

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:23.179
articles that you save or get a little bit
more content on the screen so you can quickly

00:34:23.179 --> 00:34:24.290
and get into that reading experience.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:25.360
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, I think that's a really good
point.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.639
The--a lot of the way that this is presented
is like you say it sort of inspired by newspapers,

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:30.710
I would say.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:31.830
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:35.510
&gt;&gt; MEIER: You know, in that--you can fit probably
as many articles probably not quite as many

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:39.260
if you had just this listed vertically with
the same amount of text but it would look

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.230
kind of weird because you'd have these really
long lines of text.

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:43.540
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: No, it wouldn't be nearly as
readable either.

00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.540
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, absolutely not.

00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:49.540
And so here, you've kind of taken that approach
which we've learned from over many decades

00:34:49.540 --> 00:34:54.610
of printing newspapers that people can read
columns much more easily than lots of long

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.610
flat strings.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:00.960
And so, you know, I love to see apps which
take things which we've learned from other

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.180
industries and saying well, you know what,
it's actually not that different what you're

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:10.190
creating here is an Instapaper, a way for
people to be able to quickly scan, browse

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.350
and read content.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:16.490
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah, in fact, I have to say
now when I click through to one of the stories

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:20.320
and it takes up the entire width of the screen
I'm actually kind of disappointed.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:24.270
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's interesting--I mean I think
it's one of the bigger challenges.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:28.440
So I'd been interested to know when you sort
of looking at the detail view for any of the

00:35:28.440 --> 00:35:33.640
articles, you know, how much of this is reformatted,
how much of it--are you displaying this just--did

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:34.640
I say just?

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.060
So you're displaying this in a web view and
just pulling the raw content out, are you

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.760
doing any kind of reformatting to it?

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:45.440
&gt;&gt; EMERICK: Yes, so, the Instapaper app provides
the--just a--basically a raw HTML content...

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.440
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-huh.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:51.640
&gt;&gt; EMERICK: ...we pull that down and catch
it locally on your SD card or your local storage

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:57.730
and then we have a web view that just opens
up that content and we apply a--like a cascading

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.920
cell sheet to that and some java script as
well...

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:00.920
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:03.150
&gt;&gt; EMERICK: ...and that allows you to--you
have things like change the font size, change

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.760
the font, change the line spacing, line height...

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.760
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:06.890
&gt;&gt; EMERICK: ...the margins that kind of stuff.

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:07.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:09.020
It will be...

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:10.020
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Right.

00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.020
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:12.570
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah, they kept this whole...

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:13.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:19.460
And this--we just sort of clicking on the--on
the font control dialogue here and one of

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:22.880
the things that I guess I want to point out
is again, this is another example of an app

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:29.290
which doesn't strictly conform to, like, standard
expectations of how an app should look.

00:36:29.290 --> 00:36:30.290
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:34.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: But it does do some of the--like
wherever it is close it's pretty much the

00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:35.110
same...

00:36:35.110 --> 00:36:36.110
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.110
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...so you've got the standard share
icon on what looks like an action bar which

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:40.110
has actions...

00:36:40.110 --> 00:36:41.110
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.490
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...it's obvious the way that it's
working.

00:36:42.490 --> 00:36:46.630
I kind of like to see an app affordance here
but that's kind of getting a little bit nitpicky.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:53.800
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: I think that as--as the app affordance
becomes more and more common people are going

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:54.900
to start really missing it.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:55.900
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:36:55.900 --> 00:36:56.900
So, that's yeah...

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.990
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, in some of those work you got
to remember that to target things like the

00:36:59.990 --> 00:37:00.990
Nook, they'll ask how you did it--Kindle...

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:01.990
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Right.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.990
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's a good point.

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.990
&gt;&gt; ROCK: ...we have to go back to two, one
and that...

00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.990
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.670
&gt;&gt; ROCK: ...and that presented some interesting
problems.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:13.200
That action bar is not actually, you know,
the ice cream sandwich action bar...

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, right.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:20.080
&gt;&gt; ROCK: ... that was built so as the code
base kind of modernizes and we can, you know,

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.860
the new Kindles and the new Nooks that--they've
moved off the older code base they're up the

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:24.860
ice cream sandwich now so...

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:25.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Nice.

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:30.650
&gt;&gt; ROCK: ...we're going to be able to kind
of move up to using more system frameworks

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:32.460
which we'd rather be using anyway quite honestly.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.460
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's cool.

00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:38.170
&gt;&gt; ROCK: One of those things were I don't
want to say they're hatched, they're not...

00:37:38.170 --> 00:37:39.260
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Creative backgrounds.

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.340
&gt;&gt; ROCK: ...what probably you guys would like
to see.

00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.340
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Right.

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.340
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, and that's fair enough.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:45.820
So I mean--I guess once you guys are saying
is if we had given you a backwards compatible

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.680
action bar you would have used it but we didn't
see you had to do what you could.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.550
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: That's a--that's a familiar story.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:58.210
Yeah, honestly, there's really only one thing
after playing the app for a while that bothered

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:59.790
me and that's the switch...

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:00.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:01.790
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS:...for dark mode...

00:38:01.790 --> 00:38:02.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah.

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:03.790
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...that looks like...

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:04.790
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It got me too.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:06.410
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...it may have been lifted from
somewhere else.

00:38:06.410 --> 00:38:09.970
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, the dark mode switch, the
thing which bothers me most in the look is

00:38:09.970 --> 00:38:13.710
that it's--it's not hugely responsive...

00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:14.710
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...so I find myself wanting to swipe
it...

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:17.390
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Right but you have to tap it.

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:18.390
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...but it doesn't work when you
swipe it, it's a tap.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.460
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah, and having yeah, something
that looks swipeable, that's only tappable

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.700
is actually really frustrating.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.840
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Well, I'm sorry.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:27.760
We lost you for a minute there, what element
are you talking about?

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:28.800
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Did you...

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.230
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: [MAKES NOISE] can't hear you
button.

00:38:31.230 --> 00:38:32.230
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah.

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:34.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Slick, see what you did there.

00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.579
The dark mode toggle.

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:36.579
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Uh-hmm.

00:38:36.579 --> 00:38:37.579
Yeah.

00:38:37.579 --> 00:38:38.579
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It looks like it's swipeable.

00:38:38.579 --> 00:38:40.050
&gt;&gt; ROCK: That should be changed, don't worry.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:41.050
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:42.830
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, it's going to change we know.

00:38:42.830 --> 00:38:44.450
And again, some of those were...

00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.710
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Just a quick thing.

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:49.510
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, time limitations and we really
wanted to get something out the market but

00:38:49.510 --> 00:38:54.300
we're definitely constantly looking at this
interface we're going to be adapting it at

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.300
the very near future.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.300
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:59.400
I mean I think that's--the K to this is it's
simplicity so if were any of the nitpicks

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:04.460
that we have around navigation it's actually
not too big a deal because it's really straightforward

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.760
you've only got two levels of nav, you can
never really get lost because there's only

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:09.020
so far you can go.

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:13.300
And you never sort of trying to figure out
where you're at, how does this all work, it

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.910
really use that epitome of something which
is easy to use and again one of the things

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.780
that we talk about a lot when we talk about
designing for tablet is to make sure that

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:26.150
you don't have excessive white space and I
think one of the tricks that a lot of people

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.580
do is they just fill it up with fragments
or whatever to just...

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.580
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:33.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER:...have not those long lines and
so I think that's, you know, I know we've

00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:36.720
talked about this a lot but I think that's
what you've done really well here is thought

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.290
beyond that as to well, how can we fill this
in a way that makes it a better experience

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:42.960
rather than just less sucky experience.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.290
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: And not just better but more
appropriate to the activity...

00:39:46.290 --> 00:39:47.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:39:47.290 --> 00:39:48.290
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...at hand.

00:39:48.290 --> 00:39:49.290
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:49.290 --> 00:39:53.410
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: You know, with--at the very beginning
of the show we looked at Mint.com which also

00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:58.540
filled space really, really well and they
did it by having sort of a multi-pane view

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.670
that felt like a, you know, a little bit like
a spaceship control center which I think was

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.540
really appropriate to this idea of controlling
your money whereas...

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.540
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.860
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...this feels a lot more like
it just opened up the afternoon paper and

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:11.860
I'm going to take a read.

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:12.860
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Absolutely.

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:16.230
I think that's really good observation is
sort of that difference where Mint did have

00:40:16.230 --> 00:40:22.270
sort of the gradients and the rounding to
make it sort of a more rich, sort of 3D, sort

00:40:22.270 --> 00:40:26.711
of experience and this is exactly the opposite,
this is about as flat as an app can be without

00:40:26.711 --> 00:40:30.680
disappearing into the background entirely
it's quite monochromatic.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:35.500
It doesn't have blends or gradients or anything
like that because well books and newspapers

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:36.500
don't, right?

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.850
It's just black and white text optimized for
you to be able to read.

00:40:38.850 --> 00:40:42.630
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: But of course, you know, you
can see where they wanted to have, you know,

00:40:42.630 --> 00:40:44.070
put in some nice design touches...

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:45.070
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:46.350
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...it's not that's it's not designed
it's just...

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: No, no.

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:48.350
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: ...it's designed this way.

00:40:48.350 --> 00:40:49.350
&gt;&gt; MEIER: It's designed the minimalistic way.

00:40:49.350 --> 00:40:50.350
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah, exactly.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.960
&gt;&gt; MEIER: I think that's the really important
thing, you know, it's tempting for us as engineers

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.520
I think sometimes to go oh, look at the things
I can do...

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.520
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah.

00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.920
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...and then to do them but that
can sometimes detract from a much more simple

00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:02.119
experience which can be easy for people to
use.

00:41:02.119 --> 00:41:05.850
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Well, we'll be really looking
forward to your next release.

00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:10.060
I know there's a bunch of little things I
think we've given some feedback already, you

00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:16.300
know, there was that [INDISTINCT] the way
icons are laid out on the action bar didn't

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.540
quite fit the brand new guidelines that just
came out a few months ago but I think you

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:26.050
guys are aware of all that and can't wait
to see what you guys come up with in your

00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:27.050
next version.

00:41:27.050 --> 00:41:28.050
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Definitely.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:29.050
The last thing...

00:41:29.050 --> 00:41:30.050
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yup.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:32.030
&gt;&gt; MEIER: ...I did want to ask you guys I
think we're well over the time we had initially

00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:33.030
planned.

00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:36.600
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yeah, because we've optimistically
budgeted half an hour for talking to three

00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:39.089
different developers that we're very interested
in talking to.

00:41:39.089 --> 00:41:40.089
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Exactly.

00:41:40.089 --> 00:41:41.089
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: It's...

00:41:41.089 --> 00:41:42.890
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We don't care if anyone else is
watching we've had a really good time.

00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:43.890
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: That's quite true.

00:41:43.890 --> 00:41:47.670
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So the one thing I did want to ask
so you started with tablet, have you built

00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:49.410
a phone version as well now?

00:41:49.410 --> 00:41:50.940
&gt;&gt; ROCK: No, absolutely.

00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:56.200
Yeah, and I think it more falls in your guidelines
than the newer guidelines actually.

00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.200
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's kind of cool.

00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:01.760
&gt;&gt; ROCK: And then the tablet interface does
but yeah, we absolutely run on phones at every

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:06.230
density and extremely outsize including the
newer--with the Galaxy Note layout.

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:09.950
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Oh, cool
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Which is so--I kind of have a weird

00:42:09.950 --> 00:42:12.740
voice but yeah, we've got apps for all phones.

00:42:12.740 --> 00:42:13.740
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Very cool.

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:17.830
So I guess the one question I had then is
based on that, have you seen a difference

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:23.300
in user engagement on tablet versus phone
the people reading longer on the tablet versions

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:26.110
of those metrics that you guys collect?

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:31.220
&gt;&gt; ROCK: Yeah, we do know that while people
will use the phone or the tablet really at

00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:34.580
three main times a day--right while they are
eating breakfast, probably eating lunch and

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.100
once they get home and they're--around dinner
time.

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:38.100
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Sure.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:42.730
&gt;&gt; ROCK: But we have noticed that later in
the day it's more tablet heavy.

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:43.730
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Uh-hmm.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:48.810
&gt;&gt; ROCK: So we're seeing a lot more tablet
use in a--I think kind of like when people

00:42:48.810 --> 00:42:51.184
are sitting down--I guess all these commercials
and the--they're all right.

00:42:51.184 --> 00:42:58.210
I mean people were in bed or sitting on the
couch and watching TV, pull out their tablet.

00:42:58.210 --> 00:43:03.370
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: For me, it's right when my 4G
LT phone runs out of battery that's when I

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:04.370
switch to the tablet.

00:43:04.370 --> 00:43:05.910
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Time for the tablet, very nice.

00:43:05.910 --> 00:43:06.910
All right.

00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:07.910
Perfect.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.540
So we--like I said we are well out of time
but thank you guys very much for coming on

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.900
and telling us about Instapaper and your experiences
there and thank you to all of our guests for

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:22.291
Mint, to TinyCo for joining us as well and
thank you everyone for watching and we will

00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:24.279
be back tomorrow for the App Clinic.

00:43:24.279 --> 00:43:28.500
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yes, indeed, it's going to be
a very special episode of the App Clinic by

00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.680
which I mean it will be an episode that will
run.

00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: Excellent.

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680
That is special.

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.680
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yes.

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:36.680
&gt;&gt; MEIER: That's very special.

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.020
We are looking at video player apps which
we will go in to look out last week but decided

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:45.350
that we needed to have a full extra week to
really understand what was going on in those

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:46.350
apps.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.350
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Yes.

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:48.510
&gt;&gt; MEIER: So do tune in tomorrow for that.

00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:53.160
We're also taking nominations for next week's
category which is Shopping Apps...

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.160
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Uh-hmm.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:58.000
&gt;&gt; MEIER: We're actually going to choose the
apps that we're going to look at during tomorrow's

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.300
show before tomorrow show so do make sure
if you got a shopping app you'd like us to

00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:05.570
take a look at that--you do throw it into
the moderation queue.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:06.570
Thanks again for watching.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:07.570
My name is Reto.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.570
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: I'm Ian.

00:44:08.570 --> 00:44:09.570
&gt;&gt; MEIER: And we'll catch you later.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:09.573
&gt;&gt; IN-LEWIS: Take care.
