00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.880
Hi I’m John Green, welcome to Crash Course
Navigating Digital Information.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.550
So, today, we are going to learn one of the
most important skills of 21st century life,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.000
and I don’t say that lightly.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.820
So, you know my name and that this is an episode
of Crash Course.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.900
But there’s a lot that doesn’t tell you.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.010
It doesn’t tell you, for instance, that
Crash Course is a product of Complexly, a

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.230
company owned by my brother and me and funded
partly by support from patreon, partly by

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.470
advertisements, and partly by grants from
organizations.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.810
It also doesn’t tell you who works on the
show--a large team of producers, editors,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.540
writers, illustrators, and more.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.790
You’re looking at some of them now.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.700
[camera pans to crew behind the camera]
And as I mentioned in the previous videos,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.440
the folks at MediaWise also helped us make
this video.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.500
MediaWise was created with support from Google,
and it’s a collaboration between the Poynter

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.719
Institute, a non-profit journalism school,
and the Stanford History Education Group,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:48.870
a university-based research group.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.930
All of this is helpful to know when navigating
digital information, because understanding

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.359
where information came from helps us to understand
if it’s reliable.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:02.879
How do you even find a source in a world where
no one has to cite sources, and what citations

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.160
exist are perpetually disappearing?

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.020
Well, to quote my friends Rhett and Link,
Let’s talk about that.[1]

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:20.240
INTRO
So, information doesn’t just appear, even

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.090
if it’s automated or driven by an algorithm.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:29.470
A twitter bot, for instance, is not a person--but
they were created by people, as are the algorithms

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.900
that declare what topics are trending in online
discourse.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.630
So all information is produced by someone,
but it’s also produced for a purpose.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.080
Like, newspapers are created by journalists
and editors to inform the public about things

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.610
editors think they should know.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.960
But of course, they also have to sell subscriptions
and advertisements to support themselves.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.040
Advertisements are created by companies to
convince customers to buy or use their products.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:59.420
Movies and books are created to entertain,
or to stir up important cultural conversations,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.420
or both.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.110
The lines between these motives, of course,
are not always clear.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.430
Advertisements often feel informative, and
sometimes seek to be informative-- like those

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.120
medicine ads that list 143 side effects in
10 seconds, because they are required to do

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120
so by law.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.090
And while journalism should seek to inform,
journalists are humans, and they make choices

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.880
both about what to cover and how to cover
it, choices we may not agree with.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.450
Movies and books may exist to entertain and
enlighten, but they can also exist to sell

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.340
things--it is no coincidence, for instance,
that everyone in The Fault in Our Stars movie

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.680
uses Apple products.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.310
So the first question we ask is who made this
and why?

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.800
And we mustn’t oversimplify the answers.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.220
Like, I wrote The Fault in Our Stars because
I was inspired by my friend Esther, and also

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.090
because I wanted to explore whether a short
life can be a full life, and also because

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.620
I thought people would read it--and pay for
it.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.620
The book was also a product of my editor and
Penguin Random House, my publisher.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.100
They also thought people would read and buy
it.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.490
None of those motivations negates any of the
others.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:06.480
But of course, understanding who is actually
behind a project can be difficult, especially

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480
online.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.690
I mean, “catfishing” is now a verb because
it’s so easy to pretend to be what you’re

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.690
not.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.430
The “Stop City-Funded Internet” campaign
is a good example of what I mean.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.000
So, in early 2018, the city of West Plains,
Missouri was working on a taxpayer-funded

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.569
municipal internet service project.

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.430
If successful, it would provide residents
with cheaper high-speed internet.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.800
And while the city was working on this plan,
a website for the “Stop City-Funded Internet”

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.410
campaign popped up.[2] It claimed to be a
grassroots community of local fiscal conservatives

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.410
against the plan.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.690
The campaign site looked pretty sleek and
professionally-designed.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.000
It had a clear, stated mission and high-quality
photography.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.330
Oh, and also, a list of all the ways municipal
internet service projects have failed.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.040
And just by looking at the website, you wouldn’t
have been able to tell who was really behind

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.650
that campaign, because it didn’t name names
or list its leadership.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.819
But in the end, someone did discover the brains
behind the operation.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.020
It was…of course...

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.070
Fidelity Communications, a local commercial
internet provider that didn’t want to lose

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:14.070
customers.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.600
And the only reason they came clean[3] was
because a Missouri man noticed the file name

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.910
of the site’s logo had “Fidelity” in
it.[4]

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.740
But most of the time, we don’t need to search
source code to know more about who’s sharing

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.790
the information we’re consuming.

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.080
We just need to read differently.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.400
So, we tend to read web sites like we read
books or articles: we start at the top of

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.400
the page, look at the title, and scroll down
from there.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.100
We read vertically.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.240
And many websites look really legitimate when
you’re reading vertically, because you’re

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.780
only seeing what their creators want you to
see.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.960
And creators know what we think make websites
look authoritative -- a well-designed logo,

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.620
references and citations, professional photography,
no grammatical errors or typos.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.680
And so when you read vertically, it is often
impossible to distinguish reliable information

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:01.840
from unreliable.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.750
But introducing other strategies into your
reading -- like looking elsewhere for additional

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.710
information -- can help you find out a lot
more.

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.990
When you’re on a new website, instead of
staying put and taking their word for it,

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.370
you should just... leave.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.800
Open a new tab and start looking for more
information.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.110
That’s called lateral reading.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.470
It’s lateral because, instead of moving
up and down, you’re moving from tab to tab.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.530
Basically, what I’m saying is that when
your browser looks like this, it can actually

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:29.530
be good news.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.210
Like, here’s a website from the American
Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.920
This page from 2018[5] is about a back-and-forth
in the federal government over regulating

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.500
internet service providers like Comcast, Verizon,
and AT&amp;T.

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.610
Regulating those providers could include setting
the prices and rates for their services or

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:52.139
whether they’re allowed to collect tolls
from websites or content creators, among other

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.139
things.

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.470
Apparently, ALEC is against government regulation
of internet service providers.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.010
So we want to know who ALEC is.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.430
We can tell a few things by looking at their
website.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.860
Namely that this site is apparently /not/
run by Hailey Baldwin’s famous uncle.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.010
Also the site does have a dot-org web address,
which is often used by nonprofits.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.790
The logo looks serious and kind of fancy.

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.370
The website is easy to use.

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.750
ALEC’s about page says it’s “America’s
largest nonpartisan, voluntary membership

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.330
organization of state legislators dedicated
to the principles of limited government, free

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.690
markets, and federalism.”

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.960
Its board of directors page lists many U.S.
representatives and senators.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.830
And if we stay on this page, it all seems...
you know, kind of boring and standard.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.690
But if you open a new tab and search ALEC
-- ok, yeah, the first results are Alec Baldwin.

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.090
Hailey’s uncle.

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:45.470
But below that, and below ALEC’s website,
lies their Wikipedia page and a website called

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:47.570
ALEC exposed dot org.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.930
Towards the bottom of the first page of search
results, there are news articles by websites

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:54.020
like The Atlantic and The Guardian.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.210
These say that corporations and nonprofits
are also members of ALEC.

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:02.790
We learn that one of ALEC’s stated goals
is to bring corporate leaders and legislators

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.220
together so they can craft laws.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.450
A search for “ALEC members” shows that
AT&amp;T, Comcast, and Verizon have all been members.[6]

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:15.190
Which means the original article about internet
regulation has some, you know, big conflicts

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:16.200
of interest.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.540
Internet service providers obviously have
a huge financial incentive to fight regulation.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.750
But that article doesn’t disclose that.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:27.100
So in this case, lateral reading helped us
find out who’s really behind information:

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.780
a huge group of lawmakers working with big
corporations towards their common interests.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.010
All right, so now that you understand the
idea of lateral reading, you may be wondering

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:38.590
where you should go when you open that next
tab.

00:07:38.590 --> 00:07:43.190
There are plenty of online sources you can
use to look into different organizations and

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.190
authors.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.150
They may not be perfect, but they’re a good
starting point if you’re just trying to

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.370
learn a little bit about a source of information.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.669
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:53.050
Newspapers can be a good place to start.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.919
Some of them have been around for decades
or even centuries.

00:07:55.919 --> 00:07:58.320
They have tons of information.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.199
Traditionally, newspapers provided written
information about current events printed daily

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.199
or weekly.

00:08:03.199 --> 00:08:08.460
Today, many newspapers have turned into digital
media companies that publish news online daily

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:10.680
in a variety of formats.

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.840
Some focus on international or national news
and others focus on local news.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.930
Magazines and digital news sites are useful
for lateral reading, too.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.350
However it’s important to note that many
online news organizations have their own points

00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:23.350
of view.

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:27.020
Sometimes these are explicit liberal or conservative
political leanings.

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.219
But sometimes they’re much harder to pinpoint,
like a mashup of their contributors’ own

00:08:32.219 --> 00:08:33.219
interests and perspectives.

00:08:33.219 --> 00:08:38.110
Like, a website written specifically about
comics for and by women might cover the new

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:42.829
Captain Marvel trailer differently
than a site with all male writers would, for

00:08:42.829 --> 00:08:43.829
instance.

00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:46.690
We’ll talk more about authorial perspective
in our next episode.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.939
Fact-checking websites can also be an excellent
resource.

00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:53.769
Sites like Snopes.com and Politifact.com are
well-respected fact-checking sites created

00:08:53.769 --> 00:08:55.510
by researchers and journalists

00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:57.839
with the goal of fact-checking:
articles,

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.040
public statements,
and even social media posts.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.050
Of course that doesn’t mean they’re never
wrong,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:06.430
because they’re also created by humans,
but they do strive to be right.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.420
But like every resource, fact checking websites
are just one tool in the tool box.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:12.819
There is no magic arbiter of truth.

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:14.000
Thanks, Thought Bubble!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.430
So, to reiterate, no newspaper or news site
is infallible.

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:23.579
All of this is created by humans, and humans
make mistakes constantly.

00:09:23.579 --> 00:09:24.579
All of us.

00:09:24.579 --> 00:09:29.749
Our modern media landscape is very difficult
to navigate and that has sowed distrust between

00:09:29.749 --> 00:09:33.170
the public and the quote unquote mainstream
media.

00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:35.570
But I think there are two important things
to remember here.

00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:38.519
First, “the media” does not exist.

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:40.430
It’s not a monolith.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:45.541
There are no secret meetings between every
reporter and editor and photographer in the

00:09:45.541 --> 00:09:47.930
world about what to report.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:53.720
It is a very large and diverse industry made
up of individuals with vastly different viewpoints.

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:58.600
But, secondly, it is possible to take those
different viewpoints into account when reading

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.100
laterally and checking information for yourself.

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:05.529
Now, having waded into controversial waters,
I’m about to dive into them.

00:10:05.529 --> 00:10:08.610
There’s another resource you can use while
reading laterally.

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:12.980
One you’ve been told not to use by teachers
and parents and other adults.

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.029
But I’m not like them, I’m young, and...what’s
that Stan?

00:10:16.029 --> 00:10:17.029
Oh.

00:10:17.029 --> 00:10:18.029
Apparently I am like them.

00:10:18.029 --> 00:10:23.119
Nonetheless, I am here to tell you that you
SHOULD USE WIKIPEDIA.

00:10:23.119 --> 00:10:25.600
Wikipedia can be a very good place to start
your research.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.119
You’ve definitely been told at some point
that it’s an unreliable source or that anyone

00:10:30.119 --> 00:10:32.689
can just edit at a whim.

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:33.689
Wikipedia can be wrong.

00:10:33.689 --> 00:10:34.829
It often is.

00:10:34.829 --> 00:10:41.040
Many articles CAN be edited by anyone, but
Wikipedia is also the largest general reference

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.239
work on the web, and its articles /are/ subject
to editing standards.

00:10:45.239 --> 00:10:46.940
Some of them are quite rigorous, in fact.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.819
So it can be a great place to find a general
overview of a topic.

00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:55.310
Now, not every article meets Wikipedia’s
editorial standards--as many articles say

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.779
/above/ the article--but the ones that do
are well-sourced and carefully written, and

00:10:59.779 --> 00:11:04.769
if you scroll down to the bottom of any wikipedia
page, you should find citations that work.

00:11:04.769 --> 00:11:08.410
We’re gonna talk about Wikipedia in a future
episode, but for now I just wanna say this:

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:13.790
There is no, like, single source on the Internet,
or off the Internet for that matter

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:18.199
There’s no secret way to understand the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the

00:11:18.199 --> 00:11:19.199
truth.

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:23.119
I think we sometimes forget this, so I want
to state it clearly: Information is made by

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:26.980
people--flawed, biased, imperfect people.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:32.959
But sometimes we conclude that because no
source is inherently objective, all information

00:11:32.959 --> 00:11:37.089
must be equally unreliable, and that is dead
wrong.

00:11:37.089 --> 00:11:40.480
No matter what you’re thinking about or
trying to learn about, understanding who is

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.699
sharing the information, and why, can help
you to evaluate what you’re reading and

00:11:44.699 --> 00:11:46.809
place it in its proper context.

00:11:46.809 --> 00:11:49.290
And lateral reading can really help with that.

00:11:49.290 --> 00:11:53.139
I know it feels like extra work--the entering
of search terms, looking through sources,

00:11:53.139 --> 00:11:57.319
and so on--but I’ve been trying this for
the last several weeks, and it has genuinely

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:58.540
worked for me.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.549
Instead of asking why read laterally, I think
we should consider what we lose when we don’t

00:12:03.549 --> 00:12:08.699
read laterally, when we passively scroll through
information feeds and accept what seems true

00:12:08.699 --> 00:12:11.350
and dismiss what seems wrong.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.730
Reading that way gives misinformation and
disinformation more power.

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:21.670
It allows people to hijack your consciousness,
and it also makes you part of the problem.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:26.640
The world wide web demands we utilize a new
kind of reading to evaluate information, one

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:30.089
that is very different from how we read books
or newspapers.

00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:33.040
There’s no beginning and no end to the web.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.040
Vertical reading doesn’t work because it’s
not vertical.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.199
It’s a web.

00:12:37.199 --> 00:12:42.720
So, we often need to leave individual websites
to understand that website...by using other

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.720
websites.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.699
It will get simpler over time and with practice.

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:49.029
Once, you didn’t know how to read vertically.

00:12:49.029 --> 00:12:50.389
So, we’re going to keep practicing.

00:12:50.389 --> 00:12:51.430
I’ll see you next time.

00:12:51.430 --> 00:12:56.999
For this series, Crash Course has teamed up
with MediaWise, a project out of the Poynter

00:12:56.999 --> 00:12:59.940
Institute that was created with support from
Google.

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:04.999
The Poynter Institute is a non-profit journalism
school.

00:13:04.999 --> 00:13:10.850
The goal of MediaWise is to teach students
how to assess the accuracy of information

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:12.050
they encounter online.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.679
The MediaWise curriculum was developed by
the Stanford History Education Group based

00:13:15.679 --> 00:13:17.560
on civic online reasoning research that they
began in 2015.

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:23.999

MediaWise and fact-checking, you can visit
