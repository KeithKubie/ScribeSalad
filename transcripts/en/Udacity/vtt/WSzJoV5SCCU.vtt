00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.990
Transcription factors that bind enhancer regions of DNA

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.000
and activate transcription, are called activators. And transcription

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.290
factors that bind silencer regions of DNA and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.090
repress transcription are called repressors. Now in reality,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.360
most genes are actually a mix of both

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.120
activators and repressors. Giving us a very fine

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.480
tuned gene expression pattern. Of course this is

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.730
called combinatorial regulation because there's a combination of

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.690
both activators and repressors. And a certain trait can

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.049
appear or disappear depending on the threshold of transcription

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:34.320
that we reach. For example, let's look at our

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.750
trait of lactose intolerance. If my hands here represent the

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.890
scales of a balance of lactose intolerance We're going to

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.270
look at how transcription can affect this particular trait. Over

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.760
here, we'll have lactose intolerance and over here we'll

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.060
have lactose tolerance. As a baby, many of us can

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.360
digest lactose in breastmilk. In fact, we can

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.420
do this because we have enough lactase being expressed

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.100
from the lactase gene. Having a lot of

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.720
lactase will allow us to digest that lactose, and

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.990
we won't show signs of lactose intolerance. In

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.490
fact, we'll be lactose tolerant. But as we get

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.170
older, gene transcription begins to slow or diminish

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.740
in some people, particularly those like Shao Lu. And

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.496
instead we reach a threshold, we reach a critical tipping point. Where

00:01:20.496 --> 00:01:24.620
we have so little lactose that we don't have enough to digest

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.750
the lactose in our diet. And instead the lactose stays around and gets

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.720
digested by all that bacteria and we have symptoms of lactose intolerance.
