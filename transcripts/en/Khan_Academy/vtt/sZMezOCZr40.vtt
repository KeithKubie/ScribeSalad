00:00:00.385 --> 00:00:02.733
Voiceover: We've already
seen that we can categorize

00:00:02.733 --> 00:00:07.314
triangles as being equilateral,
isoceles, or scalene

00:00:07.314 --> 00:00:09.732
based on the lengths of
the sides of the triangle.

00:00:09.732 --> 00:00:12.434
So, if none of the lengths are congruent,

00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:15.314
if you have something like this,

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.139
we would consider this scalene.

00:00:17.139 --> 00:00:19.254
I am assuming that this side
is not equal to that side

00:00:19.254 --> 00:00:21.723
and neither of these
are equal to that side.

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:23.999
So that would be scalene,
and this is all review.

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:27.074
If I have at least two
of the sides being equal,

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:30.053
so let's say that side is the same length

00:00:30.053 --> 00:00:32.709
as that side right over there,

00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:36.439
so I'll mark it off as
these are the same length,

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:42.941
this would be an isoceles triangle.

00:00:43.216 --> 00:00:47.491
Then if all three of them, all
three sides, are congruent,

00:00:48.617 --> 00:00:52.664
if all three sides are the same length,

00:00:52.664 --> 00:00:55.232
we would call this equilateral.

00:00:57.153 --> 00:01:00.008
And in most circles, you could
also say this is isosceles

00:01:00.008 --> 00:01:03.507
because isosceles would be at
least two sides being equal.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:05.120
So this one definitely
has at least two sides,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.549
it has all three.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:09.485
So this is, you could say,
equilateral and isosceles.

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:11.351
While this one, if we
assume this third side

00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:12.496
is a different length,

00:01:12.496 --> 00:01:14.441
this would just be
isosceles, not equilateral.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:15.488
Now all of that is review.

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:17.328
Now, what I want to
think about in this video

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:20.344
is well what if we're not
given the lengths of the sides

00:01:20.344 --> 00:01:22.981
and what if we're just
given a few of the angles.

00:01:23.295 --> 00:01:28.630
So, for example, let's say
we were given a triangle.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.569
Let's say that we were given a triangle

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:34.406
where we're given a few
of the angle measures.

00:01:34.456 --> 00:01:41.268
So let's say we are told that
this angle right over here

00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:46.561
is 40 degrees and this angle
right over here is 50 degrees.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.348
Now, based on that, could
you somehow classify

00:01:50.348 --> 00:01:53.312
this as scalene,
isosceles, or equilateral?

00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:56.440
Well, the key here to
realize is if you know

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.229
two interior angles of a
triangle you can always

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.683
figure out the third because the three

00:02:02.683 --> 00:02:05.541
need to add up to 180 degrees.

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:10.382
So if this is 40 and that is
50, these two add up to 90.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.205
So to add up to 180 degrees,

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:16.038
this one must be a 90-degree angle.

00:02:16.038 --> 00:02:19.624
We can even mark it as a right angle.

00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:24.550
So if you have a triangle where
all of the interior angles

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.430
are different, that means that all of the

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.600
side lengths are going to be different.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.363
One way to think about it
is if this angle became

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:41.632
wider, then this length
would have to become wider.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:45.255
If this angle became larger or smaller,

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:48.337
then this side is going to have
to become larger or smaller.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:50.699
If this angle became larger or smaller,

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.339
then this side is going to
become larger or smaller.

00:02:53.364 --> 00:02:56.189
So hopefully you
appreciate that if you have

00:02:56.189 --> 00:02:57.818
three different angles
you are going to have

00:02:57.818 --> 00:02:59.278
three different side lengths.

00:02:59.337 --> 00:03:01.290
So just based on the angles here,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.135
that we have three different angles,

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:09.339
we can say that this is going
to be a scalene triangle.

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:17.368
Now we can look at a
couple other examples.

00:03:17.368 --> 00:03:18.657
Let's do an interesting one.

00:03:26.564 --> 00:03:33.155
Let's say this angle right
over here is 70 degrees

00:03:33.155 --> 00:03:37.227
and let's say this angle
over here is 40 degrees.

00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:40.210
Now, based on the
information I have given you,

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.145
what kind of a triangle
is this going to be?

00:03:42.145 --> 00:03:43.931
Can you even figure it out?

00:03:43.937 --> 00:03:45.582
Well, we use the same idea.

00:03:45.582 --> 00:03:48.175
The interior angles need to add up to 180.

00:03:48.175 --> 00:03:54.025
70 plus 40 is 110, so
you can say 110 plus what

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.830
is equal to 180 degrees?

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.680
Well, this is going to
have to be 70 degrees.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.660
So this angle right
over here is 70 degrees.

00:04:03.114 --> 00:04:06.191
So now we have a scenario
where two of the angles

00:04:06.191 --> 00:04:07.868
have the same measure.

00:04:10.376 --> 00:04:11.502
One way to think about it,

00:04:11.502 --> 00:04:13.157
based on whether this
angle is large or small,

00:04:13.157 --> 00:04:16.287
Is going to define the length of that side

00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:18.186
and this angle right over here,

00:04:18.186 --> 00:04:20.111
depending on how large or small it is,

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:22.652
is going to define the
length on this side.

00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:26.491
So because these two angles are congruent,

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:28.239
because they have the same measure,

00:04:28.239 --> 00:04:30.689
their opposite sides are
going to be congruent.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.902
So this is going to be the same as that.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:35.554
So just based on the information
I had started giving you,

00:04:35.554 --> 00:04:38.224
because you can show that two angles

00:04:38.224 --> 00:04:40.403
are going to be the same, you can say that

00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:45.814
this is going to be an isosceles triangle.

00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:48.534
Now let's do a third example,
and you could probably guess

00:04:48.534 --> 00:04:50.907
what I am going to do
in this third example.

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.856
Let's say this angle is 60 degrees.

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.450
What type of a triangle
is this going to be?

00:05:00.346 --> 00:05:02.135
Well, if this is 60 and this is 60,

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:04.263
to make them add up to 180,

00:05:04.263 --> 00:05:08.616
that would have to be 60 degrees as well.

00:05:09.108 --> 00:05:12.123
If you have all of the angles congruent,

00:05:12.123 --> 00:05:14.763
that means that all of
the sides are congruent

00:05:14.842 --> 00:05:18.425
and so now you are dealing
with an equilateral.

00:05:18.432 --> 00:05:20.826
Now, as we said before,
also you can view this

00:05:20.826 --> 00:05:22.938
as a subset as isosceles
because you have at least

00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:25.656
two angles and you have
two sides being congruent,

00:05:25.656 --> 00:05:27.204
but here it is all three,

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:29.600
so this is an equilateral triangle.
