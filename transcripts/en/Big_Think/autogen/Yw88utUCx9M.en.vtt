the mathematics of field theory which is
 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.620
undergirds both particle theory and
general relativity so this has been an

incredibly exciting time because this

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210
and so what happened was we had a
 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.790
and so what happened was we had a
question

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800
question
 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.369
question
is there any way to go about finding

00:04:26.369 --> 00:04:26.379
is there any way to go about finding
 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:27.960
is there any way to go about finding
even better equations and we can

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970
even better equations and we can
 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.570
even better equations and we can
essentially prove that these equations

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580
essentially prove that these equations
 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.740
essentially prove that these equations
cannot be beaten in any simple way so

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750
cannot be beaten in any simple way so
 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.890
cannot be beaten in any simple way so
the possible elaborations I would say

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900
the possible elaborations I would say
 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.050
the possible elaborations I would say
are now obvious and we've tried all of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060
are now obvious and we've tried all of
 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.510
are now obvious and we've tried all of
them and none of them have seemed to

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520
them and none of them have seemed to
 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.730
them and none of them have seemed to
yield to anything that clearly advances

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740

the question is do we need a radical

00:04:50.809 --> 00:04:50.819
the question is do we need a radical
 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.070

make a modification to the foundations

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:10.520
make a modification to the foundations
 

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.160

of physics without having the whole

thing collapse around you and so even if

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:15.740
thing collapse around you and so even if

you have an idea that you're going to do

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:17.180
you have an idea that you're going to do

something very heterodox which is to

something very heterodox which is to
 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.300

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:24.670

the geometry the question is can you

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680
the geometry the question is can you
 

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:26.650
the geometry the question is can you
even get to it given the incredible
