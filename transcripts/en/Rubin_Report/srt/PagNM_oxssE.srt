1
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,970
[inaudible]

2
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,420
all right, here we go guys.
I got a Peterson. I gotta
Shapiro. I gotta Weinstein.

3
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:40,450
I got a Rubin. I feel I should go to you
first be screened using the Canadian.

4
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,330
Yeah, that's, I saw that
movie. It was pretty good and
not bad. All right. You're,

5
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,090
you're on real time tonight.
And I thought, yeah,

6
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,920
it's an interesting little piece of all
of this because we're sort of all out of

7
00:00:50,921 --> 00:00:53,830
the mainstream, but we kind of
dance in there every now and again.

8
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,990
You probably dancing. They're a
little more than the rest of us. Uh,

9
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:58,900
you're gonna smack around
Marta tonight or what?

10
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,330
You know, I, I'm, I'm, I think that
it'll probably be pretty, pretty cordial.

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,170
[inaudible] I think that Mara is secretly
one of us now, and maybe I'm wrong,

12
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,780
but I think the, I think that
Myra is tired of the, I mean,

13
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:10,400
his show was called politically incorrect.
I mean,

14
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,090
I think that he is tired
of the identity politics.

15
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,830
I think he's tired of the
intersectional nonsense.

16
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,300
I think that he wants to have
some open conversations. Uh,

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,840
I just think that he is,
he's tied politically left,

18
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:24,950
so I'll be interested to see how
much of that he goes after you know,

19
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,880
how much Trump talk there is,

20
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:29,240
which I find utterly uninteresting is
the roof and how much of it will be about

21
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,790
kind of broader issues of,
of freedom,

22
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,450
of speech and a and civility
and having decent conversations.

23
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:37,260
So I think that he's on the right
side of those issues. I mean I've,

24
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:39,290
I've played him on my show ran and
I disagree with them on everything

25
00:01:39,291 --> 00:01:39,890
politically,

26
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,580
but I play clips of him
on my show specifically on
those issues and him cracking

27
00:01:43,581 --> 00:01:45,770
the whip on people on the
identity politics nonsense.

28
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:47,000
And I think we're on the same page.

29
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,470
Well, if he wants to be an
effective advocate for the left,

30
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,490
he should lead the march and dissociating
the moderate left from the radical

31
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:58,330
unreasonable left someone's gotta do
it because the strategy that they're

32
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:00,940
abiding by right now is
pretty damn self destructive.

33
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,220
And he's in a good position to do that.

34
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:06,610
And I think he's motivated to do
it because he is a free speech guy.

35
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:08,020
Being a comedian and everything.

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,811
It's risky,
I think.

37
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:11,240
I think you take your life in your hands
if you're the leftist who says that

38
00:02:11,241 --> 00:02:13,010
right now, if you're the person
on the left who does this mean?

39
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,510
You did it and survived, but you, but
that's probably tired from the left.

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,440
That's right. You also, you
can try it. You found it,

41
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:19,800
you found a bunch of new
friends. Right? I mean that's,

42
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:22,010
that's really what people have
to understand is that when you,

43
00:02:22,011 --> 00:02:23,990
when you take these positions,
yes,

44
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:26,360
they're going to be a lot of people
who decide that you are Satan.

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:29,000
But there's going to be a whole lot of
people who are, who are your new friends,

46
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,390
who are, who are ready to
have these conversations,
which is why, you know, again,

47
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,090
this sort of IDW termed the,

48
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:38,300
that Eric coin is so fascinating because
everyone disagrees with everyone about

49
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:40,090
nearly everything in this group.
Um,

50
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,350
but because we don't want to
shut down the conversation,

51
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,260
it's created this whole audience for
every one of us, like each one of us,

52
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:48,740
our audience has increased tremendously
just by being part of conversations with

53
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:49,130
one another.

54
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,330
So that's,
that's it to me.

55
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:54,460
What is it that you guys think about
us and this wider world? Can I do it?

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,900
Come on. Just the awesomeness
and the amazing given all that,

57
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,050
but like about likeminded
that we just happen

58
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:03,940
to be the examples that are sitting here
that it is okay for all the differences

59
00:03:03,941 --> 00:03:07,630
that we've talked about
on I'm gay marriage and
abortion and death penalty and

60
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:10,480
all of these things that I know we
all have various disagreements on.

61
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:13,240
Why are we all okay with that?

62
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,530
And so many people outside of
this seemed to not be okay. Well,

63
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,650
I think it has to do with the fact
that most of us are confident.

64
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,360
There's a sort of a principle of,
um, faith in rationality that,

65
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,260
uh,

66
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,180
I'm not that worried about a lot of
the things that the far left is very

67
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:35,890
concerned about because I have an idea
that more or less if you do the reason

68
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,370
correctly, the reasoning correctly, uh,

69
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:41,080
everything is going to
work out pretty much. Okay.

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,150
And I think that we have the
dexterity in changing our minds,

71
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,890
um,
admitting when we're wrong,

72
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:52,450
when we've changed our perspective and
stealing each other's ideas and giving

73
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:56,170
credit. So that I have a
sense that if I'm, you know,

74
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,040
Ben and I have not gone toe to
toe on a abortion, for example.

75
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,410
And I have an idea of the
outlines of his position.

76
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,960
He probably has some idea of mine.
Um,

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:09,010
but my guess is is that he's not going
to go bananas on spermicide and I'm not

78
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:12,830
going to be advocating for the
right to abort a child, uh,

79
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,100
a day before it's due date. Um, and, uh,

80
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,230
except for extraordinary circumstances.
And even then, I'm not sure,

81
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,670
but I think what it is is a certain kind
of confidence that you can allow the

82
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:29,410
other person in a discussion to actually
have a genuine position and that you

83
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:30,490
can contend with it.

84
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:35,080
And what we need to do is to push out
more of the cognitive Lego that gives us

85
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,350
that confidence to more
people so that they can say,

86
00:04:38,351 --> 00:04:41,710
I don't need to fear the district.
You know,

87
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:45,430
pro choice and pro life are both
really limited positions in my opinion.

88
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,960
And it's just an example of one
of many things that we have.

89
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,530
We have gained the confidence with each
other that we're not going to devolve

90
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:55,970
into name calling if everybody,
uh,

91
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:58,440
plays in an honest fashion
and uses the full focus.

92
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,160
That's where it is. I mean, the honest
fashion things. I think what counts.

93
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:04,140
I asked him about this earlier, so I was
just doing a podcast with Sam, right?

94
00:05:04,141 --> 00:05:08,630
Because we all hang out together because
[inaudible] seven people lunch with his

95
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:13,280
mother was more important than us
events. But, uh, you know what,

96
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:17,460
what I asked him about this and what
Sam said is that he thinks that what,

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,070
what has changed is that there's,

98
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,540
there's a bunch of us who are not
interested in the stupidest version of the

99
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:27,530
argument, right? So if, if, if I want
to hear in a pro choice argument,

100
00:05:27,531 --> 00:05:30,050
I want to hear the most sophisticated
version of the pro choice argument and

101
00:05:30,051 --> 00:05:31,670
then see if I make an
argument against that.

102
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:34,130
I don't want the simplistic
version of the pro choice argument,

103
00:05:34,131 --> 00:05:36,550
just so I can knock down the simplistic
version of the prototype. Sorry. We, yes,

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,100
it makes for a great venture period
destroys video. Right? But is it,

105
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,730
but it's more fun for me,
like personally,

106
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,440
I really much more enjoy engaging with
the best ideas that somebody else has to

107
00:05:45,441 --> 00:05:48,210
offer. Then engaging with the, the worst
ideas that you can pick out of a hat.

108
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:51,820
That's really, well. So I mean, one
of the things that was useful for me,

109
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:56,260
for example, in this protracted
discussion with Sam is that my arguments,

110
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,190
my arguments are better now

111
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,080
than they were. And he might say, well,

112
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,760
why do you care if your
arguments are better?

113
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:05,660
And the reason I care about whether my
arguments are better is because I know

114
00:06:05,661 --> 00:06:10,661
that my arguments are part of the toolkit
that I use to operate effectively in

115
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,314
the world.

116
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,620
Like arguments aren't just
some abstraction that you
hold that's disconnected

117
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,820
from your actions in the world.

118
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:21,350
And if my arguments are
more fine tuned and sharper,

119
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:26,740
and if I'm able to and to our account
for a wider range of phenomena because

120
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,620
someone has put forward facts that
were hard for me to incorporate,

121
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,790
then my tool is much more efficient and
I can operate more effectively in the

122
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:39,050
world. So I find it, well it's a, it's
a variant of, of, of your position.

123
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,650
It's like I want to hear the best versions
of the arguments that run counter to

124
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,790
mine because I'd like to figure out
where I'm wrong and I'd like to make what

125
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:49,160
I'm doing better.
And that's more important to me.

126
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:52,970
It is literally more important to me
then making sure that what I already know

127
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,340
is right. How come? I'm
confident in what I know,

128
00:06:55,341 --> 00:06:59,270
but I also know that I could do a better
job of expressing it. That it could be,

129
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,270
it could be the system
could be more dynamic,

130
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,340
it could take more think
more things into account.

131
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:09,260
Like I've got plenty to learn and a real
discussion with someone who objects to

132
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:13,900
you. That's where you learn.
So, so more power to that.

133
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,260
I would say that I think
there's pretty easy test,

134
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:19,650
which is when someone catches you out on
a part of the argument that you've made,

135
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:22,800
that you, that you know was flawed
and someone catches you out,

136
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,940
do you smile or you get angry writing,

137
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,650
it really is almost that easy because
the truth is that there is something fun

138
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:33,090
about the idea of having to rethink
your position and something adventurous

139
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:34,830
about the idea that you haven't
thought everything through.

140
00:07:34,831 --> 00:07:36,990
That there are these new vistas of
thought that maybe you haven't considered

141
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:40,040
before and it does hone you.
It makes you better at it and it,

142
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,240
it also allows you to listen.

143
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,880
Life is funny and it's funny that we're
flawed human beings that are logic is

144
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:45,181
flawed.

145
00:07:45,181 --> 00:07:48,990
So there's certain humor to the idea
that somebody is exposing a rift in your

146
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,460
thinking that you know have to deal with
it. It's what makes life fun. If you,

147
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:54,600
if you were just a stone all the time,
it'd be really boring.

148
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,470
We kinda got there cause when
we did the abortion discussion,

149
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:00,020
my position basically I
think is similar to yours,

150
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:03,800
which is that at 20 weeks where they've
shown that the fetus can feel pain,

151
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:07,130
that to me is the cutoff. I described
myself as begrudgingly pro choice.

152
00:08:07,131 --> 00:08:07,821
But you said to me,

153
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,520
well if you're acknowledging that it's
a life at 20 well then it's obviously a

154
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:15,320
life at 18 now to be completely
cogent in my argument,

155
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:17,600
I have to concede that point to you.
It didn't,

156
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:21,920
it didn't move me to tell you that I'm
going to now agree with you on this,

157
00:08:21,921 --> 00:08:23,330
on what the policy should be.

158
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:27,830
But we can do that and we didn't punch
each other after and, and it's all right.

159
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,210
You know, and then what if somebody
comes in and says, well, you know,

160
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,040
life or not life is a boolean.

161
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,810
And the problem is in computer science
is one of casting, which is if you,

162
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:42,410
if you make it a float and you're
talking about the degree of life or the

163
00:08:42,411 --> 00:08:45,920
meaning of the life of the quality of
the life and does that change things?

164
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:46,500
And so,
you know,

165
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,930
this idea about may I break your frame
while I'd prefer if we stayed in it for a

166
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:53,750
little while,
but then let's explore that in a second.

167
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,070
And so there's sort of
a generosity of spirit,

168
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,360
um, argument. And I think
that quite frankly, um,

169
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:04,920
one of the strangest things about
this group of people is that I find it

170
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,970
spectacularly non egoic in
terms of when we have a dinner.

171
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:13,650
Um, I don't have a sense that
anybody needs to lead. I mean,

172
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:18,651
it's as close as I've seen like a
round table where the sheer pleasure of

173
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,590
talking to people at a ta in a time.
This is a McCarthy like time.

174
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,530
And we have,

175
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:29,820
I feel so happy to be at a table in
which I can talk about things that are

176
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:32,790
troubling me or bring out something that
I worry that says something negative

177
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:33,421
about myself,

178
00:09:33,421 --> 00:09:38,130
that I'm having these thoughts that nobody
wants to be booted out of the group,

179
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,570
um, by virtue of grand standing. And
I think that, that, that kind of, um,

180
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,200
it's really interesting watching people
who would be thought of as being highly

181
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,620
ago behaving in a ongoing fat.
It's,

182
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,900
I think that part of that too is one of
the things Dave and I have talked about

183
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,060
and the technology is enabling this,

184
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:57,300
is that because I've looked at
this group and thought, well,

185
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,640
why in the world did it ever
get categorized as a group?

186
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:01,890
Because it's a strange
group and there's some,

187
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:05,700
there's some reasons pretty much everybody
who's in it is entrepreneurial in the

188
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:09,750
fundamental sense in that everybody's
created their own little domain and it's

189
00:10:09,751 --> 00:10:13,230
Kinda hard to knock them over because
they're in their domain. So we're not,

190
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:18,420
I'm reliant in some important sense on
external funding, let's say, to, to,

191
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:21,480
to, to enable us to continue. So that
gives us a certain amount of freedom.

192
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,810
But another part of it is
that as far as I can tell,

193
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,870
everybody who's participated believes
that their audience is intelligent.

194
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,020
And I think that that's also a
reflection of that it's, it's,

195
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:36,540
it's not lack of
intellectual self confidence.

196
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,150
It is lack of commitment
to your set of ideas.

197
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,670
I guess if they're axiomatically true,

198
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:44,220
but that spills over to the
attitude towards the audience.

199
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:48,480
Like I don't feel that I'm there to tell
my audience a bunch of things that they

200
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:53,100
need to know that I already know when
I'm conducting my tour. It's like,

201
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,520
well here's a bunch of ideas that I'm
confused about still and I'm gonna use

202
00:10:56,521 --> 00:10:59,520
this as an opportunity to explore them
and I'm going to explore them with you

203
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:02,220
and you guys are going to come along
for the ride and that's going to be good

204
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:02,910
for everyone.

205
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:07,910
I really saw that with Harris in Vancouver
because we had a well as high level

206
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:10,470
an intellectual discussion
as we could manage.

207
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:14,340
And I would say it was approximately
at the same level as a good phd defense

208
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:18,870
when when the defense is going well and
the audience was with us the whole way

209
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:22,620
and they're participating
in this discourse process,

210
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:26,610
far more important to participate in
the process of discourse then to specify

211
00:11:26,611 --> 00:11:27,420
the outcome.

212
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,450
And the audience had made that decision
and abided by it while we were,

213
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,410
while we were

214
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:34,350
the discretion describing. I think that
that's, that is the difference between,

215
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,920
I think that's why like Joe
Rogan, for example, is so popular.

216
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:38,821
When I listened to Joe,

217
00:11:38,821 --> 00:11:41,820
I know he's going on an intellectual
journey that's going to take three hours.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,500
I don't know where the
destination is going to write,

219
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:45,220
but I know that the attorney is
going to be a lot of fun. Yeah.

220
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:48,840
And I think that that's, that's what
makes for success in this, in this field.

221
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,150
And so much of,
of our politics,

222
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:55,480
so much of our intellectual life has
become what you're talking about standing

223
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:58,480
on a stage and people yelling at you
what you ought to think if they're a good

224
00:11:58,481 --> 00:12:03,240
person. Right, exactly. And, and,
and it's, it's, it's no fun. I mean,

225
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,980
it's a lot. Julia was the same
thing that great authors do.

226
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:09,520
It's like a distinction between
Dostoevsky and Ayn rand. It's like,

227
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,820
you know where round is going to
aunt right from the beginning.

228
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,800
Whereas if you read a dusty yefsky novel,

229
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:17,740
you have no damn idea where that's
going to come out. And neither did he.

230
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:21,460
So he was exploring the ideas in
formulating them as he went along.

231
00:12:21,461 --> 00:12:24,860
And that's true art. And that is what
Rogan does is that, you know, and,

232
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:29,970
and he's very good at that because he's
a smart guy who isn't afraid of the fact

233
00:12:30,011 --> 00:12:31,990
that there's a whole bunch
of things he doesn't know.

234
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,510
And so he can lead people on that journey.

235
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,840
And the journey is more important
than to use a terrible cliche.

236
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,840
The journey is more important
than the destination.

237
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,620
Yeah. I think you're gonna use a tiny
time. We have to get on to other points.

238
00:12:44,621 --> 00:12:46,190
But the one thing I would add,
um,

239
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,040
which is a dangerous idea is that I think
there is a concept of good diversity

240
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:55,000
in bed diversity, which is not
understood in the general population. Um,

241
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,590
good diversity is when you
have a collection of people
with different ideas and

242
00:12:59,591 --> 00:13:02,350
they're somehow complimenting each other
and checking each other and people are

243
00:13:02,351 --> 00:13:05,350
backing down and seeing things that
they wouldn't have seen because you're

244
00:13:05,351 --> 00:13:07,900
walking around the elephant from all
the different sides and seeing all the

245
00:13:07,901 --> 00:13:08,800
different components.

246
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:13,840
Bad diversity is something like two people
grow up in different countries. One,

247
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,370
one drives on the left side of the road,

248
00:13:15,371 --> 00:13:18,740
one drives on the right side of the road.
And the idea is that you decide that,

249
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,000
uh,

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,610
everybody should be able to drive on the
same side of the road that they grew up

251
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:25,220
on. And so instead of everybody getting
to a really interesting panel, uh,

252
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,140
you get a lot of auto accidents and
nothing really interesting happens.

253
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,480
And so I think it's very important
to be honest that there is a lack of

254
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,730
diversity about what
constitutes conversation.

255
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,920
And I think that that's a
very troubling thing because,

256
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,330
um, we, there's no precedent for
discussing bad diversity at the moment,

257
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,090
which is I would much rather listen
to, to theologians talking, uh, and,

258
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,800
and building up a some
high structure and to, uh,

259
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,430
atheist astrophysicist talking
about the same thing than having two

260
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:57,790
conversations of an atheist
and an astrophysicist way
each of them keeps tearing

261
00:13:57,791 --> 00:14:01,240
down each other starting assumptions
and you come back eight hours later and

262
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:04,750
nothing has been achieved. But does that
kind of explain your success in a way?

263
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:09,010
Cause probably four years
ago in conservatives were
basically only talking to

264
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,980
conservatives the way the left seems to
only be talking to itself these days.

265
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:16,090
You started doing a little of this
and I would venture to guess that you

266
00:14:16,091 --> 00:14:17,110
probably in a way,

267
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,250
feel more comfortable with this crew who
you disagree with on a gajillion things.

268
00:14:21,251 --> 00:14:24,130
Then probably when you're hanging out
with just a bunch of conservatives that

269
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,720
you're like, yeah, we
all agree on this stuff.

270
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,640
I think that the,
the idea that I,

271
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:34,870
the phone conversations are the ones
where you're surprised and I think we have

272
00:14:34,871 --> 00:14:38,290
yet to have a group conversation or even
in conversation one on one cause we all

273
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:39,040
talk,
you know,

274
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,430
one on one to each other to where
something surprising doesn't get said. Uh,

275
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,240
and that, that makes everything
a lot more interesting and fun.

276
00:14:45,241 --> 00:14:48,550
And right now I got to say everything
is so boring. Like for all the chaos,

277
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:52,090
everything is so boring because it just,
it breaks down into a trouble.

278
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:56,630
[inaudible] court does business.
I mean it really,

279
00:14:56,631 --> 00:15:00,200
it really is just everybody feels like
everything is spun out of control,

280
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,180
but everybody's hunkered
down in their own bunker.

281
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,600
And so everything comes down to Trump
has always right or Trump is always wrong

282
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:07,280
and we're all supposed
to revolve around this,

283
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:10,670
this black hole that is Trump or the
sun that is Trump and he's the center of

284
00:15:10,671 --> 00:15:11,504
gravity.

285
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,540
I don't think most people live their
lives thinking about these problems.

286
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,110
And the whole Trump attack and Trump
defense thing is really dull. I mean,

287
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:20,650
when I went on Mars show,

288
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,410
there was the youtube part afterwards and
the panelists with the exception of me

289
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:26,910
were tearing Trump apart.

290
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,670
And I was sort of watching that
from the outside in some sense.

291
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,580
Partly because I'm a Canadian.
And I thought, well first of all,

292
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,260
it's just not that interesting
that you can list Trump's faults.

293
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:39,000
It's like you and you
and my crazy neighbor.

294
00:15:39,001 --> 00:15:43,980
It's like you're not bringing anything
to the table doing that. It's too easy.

295
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,460
And then of course the other problem
is while by going after Trump,

296
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:50,430
you're going after his supporters,
hypothetically speaking.

297
00:15:50,431 --> 00:15:52,710
And of course that's
50% of your population,

298
00:15:52,711 --> 00:15:56,340
which turns out to be a very big
strategic problem for you. You know,

299
00:15:56,341 --> 00:16:01,020
now and in the future. So it
is dull and, and, and I don't,

300
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,670
I don't think people are,
are,

301
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,090
people would rather have a
more interesting conversation.

302
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,370
That's what we can offer to so don't,
so that's what I wanted.

303
00:16:08,371 --> 00:16:09,870
Where I wanted to take this.
How do we,

304
00:16:09,871 --> 00:16:12,030
I mean we hit on this a little
bit in the first two hours,

305
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,490
but how do we do that now?
How do we lay out,

306
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,920
I think we're already laying out
a more interesting conversation,

307
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,070
but how do we also lay out something
that doesn't make everyone feel horrible?

308
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,380
Because that is a lot
of what's going on here.

309
00:16:25,381 --> 00:16:27,600
All of these people that are showing
up to your events, they're going, wow,

310
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:31,950
what a reprieve from the madness.
I mean,

311
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:34,500
I haven't been able to do that
politically. I wouldn't say,

312
00:16:34,501 --> 00:16:37,640
I mean what I've been suggesting
to people is that, um,

313
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,450
as intolerable as they find their lives
for reasons that are arbitrary and self

314
00:16:42,451 --> 00:16:43,284
inflicted,

315
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,590
there are things that they could do at
the individual level that will make a

316
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,900
radical improvement.
They're difficult things.

317
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:52,080
There are things that require the adoption
of responsibility and vision and the

318
00:16:52,081 --> 00:16:55,530
willingness to,
to speak your partial and imperfect truth.

319
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:59,100
But if you put that into
practice, there is a nap. Now,

320
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,580
one of the things that needs to be done
in the political sphere is to delineate

321
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:05,610
what that app might look like politically.
You know,

322
00:17:05,611 --> 00:17:08,490
to give people something that's
positive to strive for it.

323
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:12,060
While I mentioned earlier that I see
that to some degree in the burgeoning

324
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:16,170
literature that's suggesting that many
things around the world are improving

325
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:18,780
very rapidly. You know, and
your counter position was,

326
00:17:18,781 --> 00:17:22,460
well that doesn't mean our situation isn't
fragile, which I also agree with but,

327
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,210
but there is reason I think there is
genuine reason to be optimistic about the

328
00:17:27,211 --> 00:17:30,000
future at a sociological
and political level.

329
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:33,960
And I think that that's something
that we could be having a more serious

330
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,730
discussion about.
So

331
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,040
[inaudible] people I think.
I think that's right.

332
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,340
I also think that um,
you know,

333
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,150
what the reason that you've
been so successful is because
while you are speaking

334
00:17:46,151 --> 00:17:46,890
in,

335
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:51,280
in kind of terms about society reads it
as self help and everybody reads it a

336
00:17:51,281 --> 00:17:53,610
self help.
And I think that pretty much all of us,

337
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,830
what we are saying is
being read as self help.

338
00:17:55,831 --> 00:17:58,200
And I think that that's empowering because
basically we're saying to people is,

339
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,100
for the most part it's a free country.
Like shut up and get on with your lives.

340
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,070
Just assault. There's a bumper
sticker that was going around,

341
00:18:05,071 --> 00:18:08,700
you know that the Shapiro 2020 years for
2024 bumper stickers with the something

342
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:11,510
I tend on the show, which was solve
your own problems. Right? Which is to,

343
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,550
because we're all looking for other
veterans. One better than that.

344
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:17,790
It doesn't solve your own
problems. It's, it's three things.

345
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,170
Solve your own problems.

346
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,000
You can solve your own problems and you'll
find the deepest meaning in your life

347
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:26,490
if you decide that you're going to
solve your own phrase. Actually,

348
00:18:26,491 --> 00:18:30,180
I know that's a nice combination. I think
that message is for the vast amount.

349
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:32,880
Like even when you're talking
about societal problems,

350
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,450
the very emphasis on reason is a
suggestion that you can solve a lot of the

351
00:18:36,451 --> 00:18:38,340
problems in your life if you
change how you're thinking.

352
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,670
I think we are engaged in a collective
form of cognitive behavioral therapy.

353
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,750
I think that everybody is depressed and
we don't know why we're depressed and

354
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,440
we're upset when we don't
really know why we're upset.

355
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:49,530
I was saying my wife the other day,
if you w w a couple of things.

356
00:18:49,531 --> 00:18:51,870
So I say my wife the other day,
if you were in 19 three and he's,

357
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:55,490
someone just dropped you in 2018 you would
think, my God, this is heaven lately.

358
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,670
Like my kids aren't dying in in youth and
my wife's and gonna die in childbirth.

359
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,370
I'm not going to really have
to experience dire poverty.

360
00:19:02,490 --> 00:19:05,130
I can get anything I want from the
comfort of my own home there I have to go

361
00:19:05,131 --> 00:19:09,690
anywhere. Everybody has several cars, I
have entertainment that never ends. Right?

362
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,840
All of this stuff is just fantastic.
And then yesterday I was having,

363
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,600
I was having lunch with a
prominent Hollywood figure
whose name I won't mention,

364
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:19,320
so he doesn't lose work. And we're doing
it at a, at a restaurant in Brentwood,

365
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,500
and we're talking about Trump and politics
and I was looking around this room

366
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,340
and everybody's drinking $200 bottles
of Chardonnay and then they're,

367
00:19:26,341 --> 00:19:28,620
then they're bubbly water and they're,
and they've got their,

368
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:30,000
their Kale Salad and the whole thing.

369
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,020
And it occurred to me that 98% of the
people in this room think we are living in

370
00:19:34,021 --> 00:19:37,650
danger of incipient fascism right there.
If you'd pull the room and say,

371
00:19:37,651 --> 00:19:40,860
are we living in crisis mode? 98%
of the people that were and go, yes,

372
00:19:40,861 --> 00:19:43,210
we're living in a crisis while they
sit there chardonnay. Yeah, yeah.

373
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:46,320
That will then either you're not active
enough or you're just lying to yourself

374
00:19:46,321 --> 00:19:48,060
because you don't actually
think that we're in crisis. Now,

375
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,020
that's not to say that we,

376
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,200
we aren't at crisis point because there's
so many people willing to break the

377
00:19:52,201 --> 00:19:52,471
system.

378
00:19:52,471 --> 00:19:55,920
But I think that one of the things that's
coming true right now is that so many

379
00:19:55,921 --> 00:19:58,050
people think that the system
is irrevocably broken,

380
00:19:58,051 --> 00:20:00,180
that they are willing to break the system,
that he's not a replicable,

381
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,310
sad, essentially bring
on the recess. Yeah.

382
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,310
Because that'll rid of readiness
of Trump. It's like, well,

383
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:09,100
you want the disease so that you
can have the cure. It's like,

384
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,380
it's just not helpful. Yeah. Well,
yeah, you should sit this one out.

385
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:17,820
Oh, no, go. No, go for it.
This is the fun. Uh, so I,

386
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:19,690
I sort of radically disagree.

387
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:23,530
I think that a lot of the people who
are at the very top understand why these

388
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:28,000
games are fragile and so the
Games are still serviceable.

389
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:32,260
But if you actually understand how the
Games are played, you understand, um,

390
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,280
just how quickly this thing could turn.
So I think first of all,

391
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,600
it is precisely the people
with a enough success,

392
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:44,740
um, because how it shouldn't mean
they would be willing to turn it.

393
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,900
That's the thing. Well,
that's where I don't get the,

394
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,050
the number of people with nine and 10
figures worth of wealth who talk to me

395
00:20:54,051 --> 00:20:57,440
about like the rich and the powerful as
if they are some different groups. Yes,

396
00:20:57,470 --> 00:21:01,250
it's very hot and um,
Rich's richer than me.

397
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,020
That's what I think.
It's,

398
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:07,580
there's a difference between people who
have their senators on speed dial and

399
00:21:07,581 --> 00:21:10,850
people who don't. So, you know,

400
00:21:10,851 --> 00:21:15,320
the rich is not a monolith and that's one
of the huge problems, uh, in the story.

401
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:15,410
If,

402
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:19,880
if you're engaged in some kind of business
like armament or extraction where you

403
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:21,800
need to have a very close
relationship with government,

404
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,710
you see the world very differently
than if you're very good at picking

405
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,790
investment opportunities and you just
want to be unfettered in your ability to

406
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:31,700
go to go make more. Um, you know,

407
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:34,750
I think that one of the things that
really resonates about your message and,

408
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:39,260
and I feel a little bit less
close to Ben on is, is that, um,

409
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,930
somehow the message that you
should improve your own life got

410
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,540
conflated with if your
own life isn't awesome,

411
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,370
it's because you failed to make it so,

412
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,900
and I think that was the sort of more
true in a period of uniform high growth is

413
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:57,260
between 1945 and 1970 when,
you know,

414
00:21:57,261 --> 00:21:59,090
if you had Beta to the system,

415
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:02,420
if you just had exposure
hardwork usually paid off.

416
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:05,600
I think that depending on what sector
you're in, what your skill set is,

417
00:22:05,601 --> 00:22:09,500
where you are in your life, it's very hard
for some people to turn things around.

418
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:13,370
And the idea of, look, you may
not be able to solve your problem.

419
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:14,960
You solve the problems you can front,

420
00:22:14,961 --> 00:22:18,740
but you can solve the portion of the
problems that you can solve yourself and

421
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:20,750
that you should at least do that.

422
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,570
That is a very different
message because it says,

423
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,250
even if I'm not living in a luxury at
the end of it, it's not because I failed.

424
00:22:28,251 --> 00:22:29,210
And I think that

425
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:32,330
couple of years distinction and I,
and I, and I would probably, you know,

426
00:22:32,331 --> 00:22:33,051
given that criticism,

427
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,050
I'd probably agree to the curbing
of my own kind of solution. Right?

428
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:38,570
Like I think that, I think that's
right. Clearly there are people,

429
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,220
we are all created equal rights.

430
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:43,250
We're not all created equal and our
abilities are in our capacity to rise or

431
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:46,300
fall in a society sectors
or in terms of our 100% yes.

432
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:48,310
Yeah. And I would do the
other half of that thing,

433
00:22:48,311 --> 00:22:50,650
which is I would climb down from asking,
you know,

434
00:22:50,651 --> 00:22:54,040
if more people were willing to
admit that, I would say, okay,

435
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:58,000
it's very important that people at least
make an a copayment of trying to solve

436
00:22:58,001 --> 00:23:00,230
the problems in their own life
before demanding that the, yeah.

437
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,530
Well the [inaudible] and that's the part
that I focused on more simply because I

438
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,930
think that the government is so big.
I mean,

439
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,370
this is where politics and philosophy may,
right?

440
00:23:10,371 --> 00:23:14,180
So I think the government is so big and
so intrusive and so involved in so many

441
00:23:14,181 --> 00:23:16,560
areas of our life that the,

442
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:21,410
the tendency right now in America is to
blame other people for the problems that

443
00:23:21,411 --> 00:23:24,230
you have. And that's true on
virtually every side of the aisle.

444
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,630
I think that when you, and I have
disagreements about trait theory,

445
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:30,500
but I think when president Trump goes
to a rust belt town in Ohio and he says,

446
00:23:30,501 --> 00:23:32,720
I'm gonna bring back all your jobs because
the Mexicans or the Chinese screwed

447
00:23:32,721 --> 00:23:34,280
you. I think that that's a, that's a lie.

448
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:37,640
I don't think he's bringing
back those jobs, disagreeing
about that. Yeah. And so,

449
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,600
and so,
you know,

450
00:23:38,601 --> 00:23:43,601
I think that when my solution to that
is there's not necessarily a solution.

451
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,103
I think one of the,

452
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:47,630
that there's always a solution to every
problem that can be had if you just have

453
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:50,290
enough communal power behind
it. And I don't think that's
right. I think that the,

454
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,070
the solution for most problems in life,

455
00:23:52,071 --> 00:23:54,590
not all because I don't think all
problems in life ever get solved,

456
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,740
but at least the majority of the major
mistakes people make in their life that

457
00:23:57,741 --> 00:24:00,590
create obstacles that they can never
overcome the rest of their life are self

458
00:24:00,591 --> 00:24:02,150
inflicted. I think that the, the,

459
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:06,470
the UN barring health serious health
problems or mental disability,

460
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,550
I think the d the number of problems that
make it impossible for you to overcome

461
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,010
sheer dire poverty in the United States.

462
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,350
Virtually all of those problems are
problems that people put in front of

463
00:24:15,351 --> 00:24:17,690
themselves. And so if you can
make those basic decisions,

464
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:20,060
they can turn their life around
it and a pretty significant way.

465
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,940
Yeah. Or even if they're not problems
that people create for themselves,

466
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:29,010
there are problems that are there subject
to that are also very intractable to

467
00:24:29,251 --> 00:24:30,660
communal level solutions.

468
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,660
Like mental illness is a good example
of that and its contribution to

469
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:34,710
homelessness.
It's like,

470
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,980
well it's terrible to be mentally
ill and to end up on the streets.

471
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:42,840
It definitely is terrible, but it isn't
like we actually know how to solve that.

472
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,680
So even if that can't be put at the feet
of the individuals who are suffering,

473
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:48,420
it's like,
okay well we'd like to sort that out.

474
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:51,840
Community leads party to sort that out
without making it worse. We don't know.

475
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,530
Do you guys think we can only make it a
little better or a little worse? Like,

476
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:58,230
of course all hell could
break loose on one side of it,

477
00:24:58,231 --> 00:25:00,000
but that within the margins,

478
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:03,970
like it's pretty good and we can maybe
make it a little better, but that,

479
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,460
that the capacity for humans to make a
system much better than this that will

480
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:13,020
allow people to flourish works like
that's what I'm hoping is that we can aim

481
00:25:13,021 --> 00:25:15,780
for incremental improvement,
which compounds by the way,

482
00:25:15,781 --> 00:25:18,030
so that that's very powerful,
incremental improvement,

483
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,810
but we could aim for
incremental improvement while
deciding that we're going to

484
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:26,550
stay off stave off chaotic and unnecessary
descends into the abyss. Right.

485
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,560
Which is what I see the danger in this,

486
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,470
in this polarization processes generating.

487
00:25:31,471 --> 00:25:34,590
It's like a catastrophe
that we actually don't need.

488
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,230
W what do you make of the amount of
people that seem to want that right now?

489
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:40,680
I mean, I always say every week on this
show it's like Twitter is not real life.

490
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,010
Yeah.

491
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,180
But the amount of people that I'm seeing
constantly talking about tear it down

492
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,830
and now the new attack on civility where
even if you say be civil, be respectful,

493
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:53,370
that that is now thought of as a tool
of the patriarchy or a tool of the

494
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:57,570
oppressed or uh, all of that stuff.
What do you make of that assault?

495
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,850
I mean,
I think first of all,

496
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:02,000
the fun mental hatred of the
system by a lot of people is,

497
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,450
I'm not going to justify it given the
fact that the system that we have is the

498
00:26:05,451 --> 00:26:06,890
best that has ever,
you know,

499
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:09,440
happen to any human beings in
the history of the world. I mean,

500
00:26:09,441 --> 00:26:13,340
this is a pretty great place to live.
Um, compared to all other, right? Yeah.

501
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,680
That's him. That's him compared
to utopia compared to heaven.

502
00:26:15,681 --> 00:26:16,790
I'm not saying can't get any better.

503
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:20,210
I think that one of the great
dangers always his utopianism,

504
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,920
and I think you're seeing
it from both sides. I mean,

505
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:25,730
right now when you saw Alessandra Kazia
Sanchez when in New York and she's

506
00:26:25,731 --> 00:26:28,400
promising universal healthcare,
universal college tuition,

507
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,280
universal universal housing,
right.

508
00:26:31,281 --> 00:26:33,820
All of this stuff is going to magically
happen and she's asked on Msnbc are

509
00:26:33,821 --> 00:26:36,700
going to pay for any of this and she
just basically as well just how FDR did.

510
00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:40,280
FDR didn't, okay. That was one of
the big problems. Yeah and the,

511
00:26:40,281 --> 00:26:44,040
and also there is a giant world war
happening at the time so it's the,

512
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,120
the the itch to [inaudible]
to grow to provide that.

513
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,480
That's the thing that you really,
you really want to,

514
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:55,590
you want to make a state that has
enough power to grant all those wishes.

515
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,220
It's like careful what kind of genie
you generate cause it's going to have a

516
00:26:59,221 --> 00:27:00,150
demand on you.

517
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:05,490
So I don't think the market is that
free markets are inherently utopia and I

518
00:27:05,491 --> 00:27:07,780
don't think that a vast government
is inherently, you told me,

519
00:27:07,781 --> 00:27:10,290
but I think free markets at least have
a certain respect for human labor.

520
00:27:10,291 --> 00:27:14,370
Dignity and individuality and collectivist
utopia is certainly do not or they

521
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:17,590
also have a certain distributed quality.
It's like,

522
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:20,880
it's not like there's a central
administration making the decisions.

523
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,910
So even if the decisions are bad,
which sometimes they are,

524
00:27:23,911 --> 00:27:26,970
they tend to be self correcting
and mostly the operate locally.

525
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,990
So there's something to be said for that.
So what do you say it

526
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:33,030
people that are going to listen to
this that I think you're a little more

527
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:36,050
sympathetic to the that are going but,
but we need help or,

528
00:27:36,051 --> 00:27:41,051
or this is the sounds cold
or to individually apps
is going to be colder than

529
00:27:41,311 --> 00:27:43,410
this.
You guys are like warming my heart.

530
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,950
We hear stories about individuals calling
themself up with their bootstraps.

531
00:27:46,951 --> 00:27:51,951
I mean there was a phase change in the
economy around 1970 that I cannot get

532
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:57,330
people to focus on. And you
know, if you look at like GDP,

533
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,090
which is a very flawed measure
and median male income,

534
00:28:00,091 --> 00:28:03,540
which Tyler Cowen I think was the one
who pointed out that this is the best

535
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:06,180
version of the argument. One
of these things, they're,

536
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:10,960
they're both growing up together until
like 1970 and then one of them flat lines.

537
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:12,060
And then it keeps going.

538
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,150
And the idea that this is not a
structural change that is in every school

539
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:22,550
textbook and that we don't understand
that we've built up to plus generations of

540
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,500
experts lying about

541
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,280
what happened and how do you, what
do you think happened? What do you,

542
00:28:29,281 --> 00:28:32,760
why did that, cause I've read
criticisms of the decoupling theories.

543
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,690
Nobody likes my version of it,
but I'll give it,

544
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:36,990
give it to you cause
I don't understand it.

545
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,420
Everyone who cares about this stuff should
read a guy named Derek to solar price

546
00:28:44,751 --> 00:28:49,130
who was active in the late fifties and
started talking about there will be a

547
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:53,360
singularity in science. So he looked
at price's law. Yeah. Number of PhDs,

548
00:28:53,361 --> 00:28:55,850
number of journals,
number amount of funding.

549
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,540
Everything was going up exponentially and
things that go up exponentially cannot

550
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,973
continue.

551
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:04,790
And so he predicted this is going to
end because there will be too many Ph,

552
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,670
you know, too many PhDs per child. Um,

553
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,460
and sure enough that
system sort of came apart.

554
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:14,270
So if you look at the period from
between 1945 to 1970 you have this growth

555
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:19,271
regime and everything that
got built during that time
has what I call an ego and

556
00:29:19,401 --> 00:29:22,460
embedded growth obligation.
If it doesn't grow at this rate,

557
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,680
it's going to turn pathological.

558
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,890
And so we built a ton of infrastructure
around this beautiful period of high,

559
00:29:30,381 --> 00:29:34,190
broadly distributed,
fairly even in stable technology,

560
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,420
technologically like growth.

561
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:40,430
And that ended and then began this crazy
period of excuse making where we found

562
00:29:40,431 --> 00:29:43,660
every gimmick demand. And if you want
to read an article about this call,

563
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:48,130
I think I wrote one called a anthropic
capitalism in the new gimmick economy.

564
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,160
And so part of the problem is,

565
00:29:50,161 --> 00:29:55,161
is that the concept of jobs as how we
feed ourselves rather than creative

566
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:59,440
enterprises or something else,
um,

567
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:04,620
jobs are probably tied to a period of
time that isn't going to go on forever.

568
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,810
And it's probably weakening
as a means of feeding us.

569
00:30:07,811 --> 00:30:11,770
So the market was unbelievably brilliant.
And then there was a structural change.

570
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:16,180
And now the question is how do we
account for these egos that make embedded

571
00:30:16,181 --> 00:30:18,090
growth obligations that make layers of,

572
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,800
of all of the experts who
service the institutions.

573
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,420
So the big problem that we're having,

574
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:25,010
the reason we can't wake
up from this madness is,

575
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:29,740
is that you've had since about 1970
people having to lie to keep the

576
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,430
institutions afloat. So what's
the lie? Well, take a law firm.

577
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,040
The idea is you have some number of
partners. The partners have associates.

578
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:37,840
All the associates want
to become partners,

579
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,390
so you have to tell them a
story about if you work hard,

580
00:30:40,391 --> 00:30:44,710
you will become partners. But when you
hit steady state like the professors,

581
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:47,860
the professor wants to have 20 students,
20 students want to become professors,

582
00:30:47,861 --> 00:30:50,830
to have 20 students.
None of this stuff works anymore.

583
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,870
It's a hidden, they call that
game. It's a hidden pyramid scheme,

584
00:30:57,090 --> 00:31:00,510
hidden page and it scheme,
it got come ability levels since 1980.

585
00:31:00,511 --> 00:31:04,450
I've been relatively stable in the United
States while we've been a very rich

586
00:31:04,451 --> 00:31:07,930
family trying to figure out ways to
live out our days in the style to which

587
00:31:07,931 --> 00:31:10,990
we've become accustomed. And we found
every kind of gimmick known demand,

588
00:31:10,991 --> 00:31:15,280
whether it's offshoring or uh, you
know, mergers and acquisitions or,

589
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:17,980
um, you know, self regulation of markets.

590
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:21,520
All of these things that we learned how
to do it just the transfer over to the

591
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:24,220
service economy as opposed to in the
intellectual economy as opposed to

592
00:31:24,221 --> 00:31:28,210
manufacturing. Well, the thing is, is that
a lot of this was led by something like,

593
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,610
you know,
science in the form of let's say,

594
00:31:30,611 --> 00:31:33,970
just semiconductors coming out of
physics. You know, how much of, of,

595
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,620
of our current, uh, growth has been
scientifically led. And now, you know,

596
00:31:38,621 --> 00:31:39,311
with Moore's law,

597
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:42,040
the reason that everybody talks about
it is it's one of these growth laws that

598
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,760
can't go on forever.
So

599
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,450
do you think doing pretty
well? I mean, part of it,

600
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,690
I know things that are impossible
can't continue forever.

601
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,390
That's the rule of hasn't been
dabbling seems to be one of them.

602
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:56,470
The ideas that we've been pretty good
staving off disaster for a very long time,

603
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:59,770
but it seems to me though that
there is like this, and this is,

604
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,340
this is perhaps part of the contradiction
that people are arrested with is like,

605
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,660
ah, you're appointed to two structural
deception, let's say something like that.

606
00:32:07,661 --> 00:32:12,070
And delusion, the delusion that go along
with it. But it also does seem to me,

607
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,740
and this is where the measurement
issues become so complicated,

608
00:32:14,741 --> 00:32:19,741
is that even though wages among men have
been flat since the 1970s I think you

609
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:23,320
could make a pretty cogent case
that we are actually in many ways,

610
00:32:23,321 --> 00:32:26,830
much richer than we were. First
of all, the world's much richer.

611
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:30,250
There's much less poverty worldwide,
and in an absolute sense as well.

612
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:34,430
And so even if the average American
isn't richer, let's say, oh,

613
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:38,590
although we could dispute that the world
that surrounds him as much richer and

614
00:32:38,591 --> 00:32:42,140
that actually constitutes
a form of accrued wealth
because you're actually safer

615
00:32:42,141 --> 00:32:45,690
when when a quarter of the Chinese aren't
starving in a quarter of the Indians.

616
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:49,700
Appreciate. Okay. So, but so, but
then I would also say, so there,

617
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,370
although there's been local
stagnation in the west,

618
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,880
arguably there's been global
massive global improvements and,

619
00:32:56,890 --> 00:32:58,400
but then the other question is,

620
00:32:58,401 --> 00:33:02,090
is the idea of local
stagnation actually accurate?

621
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,420
Because there are lots of ways that we
are clearly way richer than we were now.

622
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,810
Um, we're certainly richer in terms of
our access to high quality information at,

623
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,570
at a very,
very low cost.

624
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:19,340
And so the technological revolution seems
to be real and we can purchase a lot

625
00:33:19,341 --> 00:33:23,300
more of this high quality technology for
less money than we could. So I'm not,

626
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,420
I'm not entirely convinced of the wage
state about the wage stagnation argument.

627
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:29,833
There's a

628
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,090
tremendous meant to be done, but the
metrics about how we measure things,

629
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,900
there's also a total flaw that
is suffused throughout economics.

630
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:40,920
I just came back from four days in Venice
and the first day in Venice, I thought,

631
00:33:40,921 --> 00:33:44,460
this place is unreal. The most beautiful
thing I've ever seen in my entire life,

632
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:49,350
every 52 years didn't prepare me for
four days later. I was like, wow,

633
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:50,460
there's so many tourists and

634
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:57,450
took almost no time to remove
that level of magic. Um,

635
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,620
because I got used to it that
quickly. Right? Yeah. Right. Yeah.

636
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,810
Well that's a problem we get. We get
used of the head on it are going well.

637
00:34:03,811 --> 00:34:07,020
Extraordinarily chronic numbing
is a real issue. And the thing is,

638
00:34:07,021 --> 00:34:11,280
is that what were the Gini coefficients
measuring the inequality during the

639
00:34:11,281 --> 00:34:13,620
period that was going up?
You know,

640
00:34:13,621 --> 00:34:18,600
we're now in a period of such
inequality that, um, you know,

641
00:34:18,601 --> 00:34:23,070
humans are very focused on
things like status and CSCS.

642
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:27,450
And so it's not clear to me that people
wouldn't be actually happier in a

643
00:34:27,451 --> 00:34:31,040
totally different regime. I mean,
we have enough stuff from China.

644
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:35,530
Exactly right now. In all in all
of that, Mike. Michael. Wow. Okay.

645
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:36,040
So that's,

646
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,700
that's an interesting issue because one
of the things we could say perhaps is

647
00:34:39,701 --> 00:34:44,701
that between 1945 and 1972 what was
provided for people wasn't so much on a

648
00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:48,610
standard of living that's
higher than we have now,

649
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:53,290
but a trajectory of development
that appeared more stable,
stable and believable.

650
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,030
And so low variance yet, right? Yes. Well,
so, so, and then the question is, well,

651
00:34:58,031 --> 00:34:59,380
what actually do you want?

652
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:03,610
Do you want a high standard of living or
do you want to believe that if you put

653
00:35:03,611 --> 00:35:04,570
an incremental effort,

654
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,960
your life can improve and it could easily
be that people will rather have the

655
00:35:07,961 --> 00:35:11,590
ability to make a 30 year
plan. We want the ability, yes.

656
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:16,980
If what I value the ability to bring a
30 year plan and I want to have some idea

657
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:20,650
of how I'm going to get to my retirement
and put kids through school and do all

658
00:35:20,651 --> 00:35:23,310
of this and I want them to,
it's this plan. Yeah. Right.

659
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:26,760
So the idea is that predictability is
gone, no question. And it's right. Right,

660
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:27,470
right.

661
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,430
That's why I said jobs are not going to
be the means of redistribution of the

662
00:35:30,431 --> 00:35:35,170
wealth. I do wonder if, you know, on the
individual level, I think that that's,

663
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:38,040
you're right, there's, there's
enormous amount of calves in

664
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,770
volatility in the system and it,

665
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:43,130
but I think that the only thing that you
can say to that is the same thing that

666
00:35:43,131 --> 00:35:45,090
that's been true for most of
human history. Okay. The, the,

667
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:47,140
the time when people
could actually stable,

668
00:35:47,141 --> 00:35:51,060
he predict that in 30 years I will be
significantly better off than I am now and

669
00:35:51,061 --> 00:35:54,810
I can make a retirement plan that's
about 50 years of human history. Right?

670
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,360
I mean, before that it was
basically you have two kids,

671
00:35:57,361 --> 00:35:59,450
one of them dies and then
your wife dies in childbirth,

672
00:35:59,470 --> 00:36:01,260
but birth with the second to you have,

673
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,890
you have eight right now you have
eight and six of them die three or

674
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:07,860
miscarriages in fine.
Yeah. And so, so this,

675
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:12,861
this dream that we had from 1940 to 1970
even if I actually love the premises,

676
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,810
uh, I'm not sure that that's a realistic
dream about what goes. My point is it,

677
00:36:16,811 --> 00:36:19,500
yeah. So that was the anthropic
capitalism. You just described it.

678
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,760
Now you've got 10 not don't
know for your article, but it's

679
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:26,400
in a bit more than that.
I mean I'm sure there is and just joking,

680
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,890
but I'm going to make it.

681
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,660
The only point I'm making is that I think
that what really has been lost in this

682
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:34,170
is the part that, that I'm really
focusing on a lot lately I is,

683
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,330
we can't control the situation around us,

684
00:36:36,331 --> 00:36:38,310
but we can't control our
reactions to the situation.

685
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:42,690
And what I mean by that is these massive
systemic changes that we're talking

686
00:36:42,691 --> 00:36:45,210
about. We number one, don't agree on what
the systemic changes should be, right?

687
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,120
And number two, even if they are what
they are or what they would do, right,

688
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:50,850
nobody knows what the hell they would do.
And with all of that said,

689
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:53,430
the one thing that you can control
is the amount of virtue that you,

690
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:55,230
yourself pour into your life.

691
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:59,210
And it seems to me in a non virtuous
position that because somebody else's

692
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,710
earning more than you,
you are therefore worse off.

693
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,760
And so what we really have lost, I
think, and this may be an outgrowth that,

694
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:07,140
I mean there's,
there's an argument to be made.

695
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,940
I know General Goldberg makes
this argument for example,

696
00:37:08,941 --> 00:37:13,650
but that sort of late stage capitalism
or advanced capitalism tends to, uh,

697
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,040
tends to lead to this rat race where we
are looking at what the guy next door to

698
00:37:17,041 --> 00:37:18,600
us has.
But the,

699
00:37:18,601 --> 00:37:23,601
but the lack of just basic virtue in the
position that I am more soft because my

700
00:37:23,911 --> 00:37:27,120
neighbor is better off even though I have
more stuff than I did five years ago.

701
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,050
Uh,

702
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:32,700
the lack of inculcation of any sense
of what I would call basic morality is

703
00:37:32,701 --> 00:37:34,350
having a significant impact.
Is it

704
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,050
one of the things that's
happening clearly in, in,

705
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,270
in the tour that I'm doing and the people
that I'm talking to is I'm actually

706
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:44,400
making a variant of that case.
I said that and, and it's,

707
00:37:44,401 --> 00:37:47,680
it's probably in keeping
with your vision as well. Um,

708
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,540
so let's imagine that a rising tide
does lift all boats and that's actually

709
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:53,021
happening.

710
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,440
But we're purchasing up that at the price
of a certain degree of predictability

711
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,080
and stability into the future.
That seems quite clear.

712
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:03,100
And now it's exaggerated by
this incredibly rapid rate
of technological change.

713
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:03,941
It's like,
okay,

714
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:07,840
so how do we tolerate all that
uncertainty given that we're also deriving

715
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:10,720
substantial benefit from it? We don't
want to, we don't want to mess it up.

716
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:15,280
And what I've been suggesting to my
audiences is get your act together as much

717
00:38:15,281 --> 00:38:18,970
as you possibly can because the way that
you deal with uncertainty is by being

718
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:21,700
prepared for anything and everything
that's going to come your way.

719
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:25,780
And so you want to put yourself together
so that when the difficult decisions

720
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:28,330
come along, even though we
can't predict what they are,

721
00:38:28,450 --> 00:38:30,550
you're going to be in the best
possible as a new message here.

722
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:35,020
The new message is that whatever,
like I want to tell somebody,

723
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,070
you know,
very

724
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:38,290
often I hear parents,
like we have uh,

725
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,710
two children and one of them is
living at home. And I say, okay,

726
00:38:41,711 --> 00:38:44,590
let me explain in part why your child
may be living at home when you're

727
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:46,960
disappointed that that's happening.
Right?

728
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:50,560
And so I go through the economics are
you, the person feels better. Oh Wow.

729
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,500
Or I explained, you know,
here's why you're not able
to catch up to your parents.

730
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:56,110
It's not all about your personal failure.
Right?

731
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,220
And so the idea is that that personal
responsibility is something that we need

732
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,100
and we also can't have,
right. It's too dangerous.

733
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:06,130
You have to do this tailored message.
And I think you've been intuiting this,

734
00:39:06,131 --> 00:39:10,150
like here's the portion of your life that
you're responsible for and we're going

735
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:12,160
to delineate it.
And if your room isn't cleaned up,

736
00:39:12,161 --> 00:39:16,600
it's not because of the government.
Right. That was your point saying,

737
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:19,900
and this is, you know, again,
you and I are going to have
to do this at some point.

738
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:24,670
Um, this is a great country and well,
if you put your mind to making money,

739
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,670
then it may be the case that stick to it.

740
00:39:27,671 --> 00:39:31,690
Agnus and passing the marshmallow test
and being inventive and creative works.

741
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,320
But there are a lot of people who are
given a very different message and they

742
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:36,790
grow up being told,
you know,

743
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:41,470
be a good person and work hard and a
lot of the stuff doesn't work the way it

744
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:45,070
used to. It just doesn't. And
whining about it offends me.

745
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,080
So I want to say,
look,

746
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:51,850
if making money is very important and we
need to be able to talk about the role

747
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,260
of money, it's money is
fungible. Everything else is
not. So if you make money,

748
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:59,470
then you have lots and lots of options
and we need to give people the idea that

749
00:39:59,471 --> 00:40:03,010
that's a good thing to pursue
if they have any hope and dream.

750
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:07,570
But it's also the case that fundamentally
what we are, what your message is,

751
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:11,710
is you have to make the copay and the
copay is the part of your life that you

752
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:15,130
absolutely control.
And if that's out of control,

753
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:18,690
don't expect anyone else to take any
sympathy. Then you can also make them.

754
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,530
If that part of your life is in order,

755
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:24,910
you can also make a more credible
argument for the existence of unreasonable

756
00:40:24,911 --> 00:40:28,000
systemic impediments. Because
you can say to yourself, look,

757
00:40:28,001 --> 00:40:30,440
I put everything into this group,
then you can make a credible,

758
00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:31,520
this is why this is the,

759
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:35,730
the attractive version of the personal
responsibility thing that the point we

760
00:40:35,731 --> 00:40:36,010
have it,

761
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,160
we have another problem here with our
discussion about dispossession because

762
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:43,060
like one of the things that bothered
me about the left and the right is the

763
00:40:43,061 --> 00:40:46,630
right tends to think, well if you just
got your act together and worked hard,

764
00:40:46,631 --> 00:40:50,620
you can make it and the, and the,
and the, the left tends to think,

765
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,720
well everybody's the same.

766
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,420
And if you removed systemic
impediments than everybody could,

767
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,230
could do whatever they needed to do while
the left is wrong because there's real

768
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,370
diversity of ability.

769
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,490
But the right is wrong because
there's a real diversity of ability.

770
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,560
And so for example, there is
a distribution of Iq which
is real. And if you're,

771
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,800
if you're the,

772
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:14,290
the psychometric data basically indicates
that if you have an Iq of less than 90,

773
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,620
which is about 15 20% of the population,

774
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:22,450
you actually can't read well enough to
follow instructions. And you might say,

775
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:23,600
well,
um,

776
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:27,610
that can be rectified say
through education means and
so forth and the evidence

777
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,870
for that,
it's pretty damn fan.

778
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,560
And so the problem with a society
that's meritocratic fundamentally,

779
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,660
even if it's meritocratic
based on character,

780
00:41:35,661 --> 00:41:38,780
is that they're still going
to be individual differences
that seem to be a Nate

781
00:41:38,781 --> 00:41:40,940
though you're going to produce
radically on equal outcomes,

782
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,410
many of which are painful.

783
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:47,240
The thing that you will have a hard time
convincing me of having gone through,

784
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:47,630
uh,

785
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,630
the PHD system in the sciences is that
some of the world's most brilliant people

786
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:55,430
hold PhDs in the sciences.

787
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,460
And I came up at a time when in the early
nineties these people were told that

788
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:03,950
the world was their oyster and that we
were desperately in need of scientists.

789
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:09,370
And I remember a friend of mine being
told that he had a $14,000 a year job

790
00:42:09,441 --> 00:42:14,441
offer post phd from Mit with a pregnant
wife and the person who offered it,

791
00:42:14,501 --> 00:42:17,840
it was like, this is great. We can,
we can, we can get people for pennies.

792
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:19,580
And why was that?

793
00:42:19,581 --> 00:42:24,350
It was because of something that came
out of the National Academy of Sciences

794
00:42:24,351 --> 00:42:29,351
and the National Science Foundation to
slam American workers in the sector.

795
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,040
This is very,
very important.

796
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:35,810
It had predicted that people would
be paid six figures for for PhDs,

797
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,520
uh, which was you know, larger than
they had been paid for a long time.

798
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,260
And it was the meddling with the market.

799
00:42:42,261 --> 00:42:45,910
The thing that I don't like about
the personal responsibility issue is,

800
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:50,911
is that individuals should not be solving
the problems of let's say tech groups

801
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,830
getting together and say we will
not poach each other's employees.

802
00:42:54,831 --> 00:42:58,880
That like the market has to work
for people, not just institutions.

803
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,120
And if you're in a sector in which
you can make the market work for you,

804
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,270
you have this feeling
of anybody can do this.

805
00:43:05,271 --> 00:43:09,050
And in fact what you need to do is you
need to migrate to these sectors because

806
00:43:09,051 --> 00:43:13,250
there are other sectors where you have
let's say government intervention which

807
00:43:13,251 --> 00:43:17,180
says we are going to interfere with the
free working of the market or we are not

808
00:43:17,181 --> 00:43:19,790
going to take into account that
some people produce public goods.

809
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:24,890
And so it's very important to me to
understand that some people are coming out

810
00:43:24,891 --> 00:43:29,060
of very different circumstances in which
it's very unlikely that they will be

811
00:43:29,061 --> 00:43:30,920
able to make their world, uh, you know,

812
00:43:30,921 --> 00:43:35,120
grow and blossom and that other people
have extraordinary ability and high Iq

813
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,110
and work ethic,

814
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:41,270
find themselves not fighting forces
that they don't even sort of criticism

815
00:43:41,271 --> 00:43:43,460
that's often levied at me
because people say, well,

816
00:43:43,461 --> 00:43:46,070
you don't take the systemic
problems sufficiently into account.

817
00:43:46,430 --> 00:43:49,460
And so that's a nice outline of
the systemic, you know, when,

818
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:54,260
when the banks decided that they should
be self-regulating, uh, with respect, uh,

819
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,340
you know, to, to their gearing
ratios or the risk. Um,

820
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,380
there was one guy who wrote in at this
to this sec hearing to allow these

821
00:44:02,661 --> 00:44:06,880
investment banks to, you know, do
the last little bit before 2008, uh,

822
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:11,060
blew up everything. This guy Len bullae,
who was a computer consultant to banks,

823
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:16,420
it's like one guy in the entire country
saw a disaster coming and got involved

824
00:44:17,901 --> 00:44:22,010
in this internal game that
was by banks for banks.

825
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:25,940
And so what's very important to me is
to understand when you have bad behavior

826
00:44:25,941 --> 00:44:27,020
by institutions,

827
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:32,250
it is pathological to put that
responsibility on shoulders. Well,

828
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,910
the only code I would make to that,
and I think that's a fair comment,

829
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,740
is that what I'm hoping and what I'm
trying to convince people of is that

830
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,140
they're ethical responsibility,

831
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:46,560
which is partly to further their own
development to the degree that they can,

832
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:50,610
does extend to the community is that you
want to make ethical citizens so that

833
00:44:50,611 --> 00:44:55,290
they don't make mistakes that corrupt
the operation of the system at a systemic

834
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,590
level. The best way to do that, in
my estimation over the long run,

835
00:44:58,591 --> 00:45:02,910
is to concentrate on the ethical
behavior of the sovereign citizen.

836
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:06,270
Now that doesn't address the systemic
problems that are already in place.

837
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,730
The systems systems affect more people.

838
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,150
That means that when people make vague
accusations about systems that are

839
00:45:12,151 --> 00:45:15,240
dysfunctional, then it's not
helpful. Know what I see is not,

840
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:19,830
you're making very specific criterias of
very specific institutions in areas and

841
00:45:19,831 --> 00:45:22,200
those that's useful because then we can
actually have a discussion about where

842
00:45:22,201 --> 00:45:23,070
those systems go wrong.

843
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:26,520
So you can have it as [inaudible] you're
balancing the patriarchy, right? Exactly.

844
00:45:26,521 --> 00:45:30,030
You can, we can discuss. No, I'm trying
to, I'm trying to crowd that out.

845
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:34,870
And part of it is, is that
almost nobody in the regular, um,

846
00:45:34,950 --> 00:45:37,410
commentary it wants to talk to me

847
00:45:37,790 --> 00:45:41,210
about what went wrong with
our immigration policy.

848
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,940
How do we get into trouble
with mortgage back securities,

849
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:48,410
what's going on with CPI adjustment
because I've fortunately we got something

850
00:45:48,411 --> 00:45:50,570
better going on here, so let's not
worry about that. But you know,

851
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,460
we only have about 10 minutes
left because you got a hard out.

852
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,740
So I thought we do a little
self therapy while we're here.

853
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:55,850
So I want to ask you each one thing,

854
00:45:55,851 --> 00:45:59,840
I'll even answer it myself and then we
can all sort of comment. Uh, I'll, uh,

855
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:03,560
I'll start there. Um, if
you had one blind spot,

856
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:05,360
what do you think it might be?
I,

857
00:46:05,361 --> 00:46:09,020
I've asked you guys some version of
all of this before. Um, but you know,

858
00:46:09,021 --> 00:46:11,240
a lot of changes over the
time that we keep doing this.

859
00:46:11,241 --> 00:46:14,690
But if there was something that you
thought was your personal blind spot,

860
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:16,360
what would it be?

861
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,890
Well, I would say, I don't know if I
can identify a specific blind spot,

862
00:46:20,891 --> 00:46:22,780
but I can say in general,
you know,

863
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:26,890
I know perfectly well that I don't know
enough about a lot of the things that I

864
00:46:26,891 --> 00:46:30,430
need to know about to make the sorts
of arguments that I make it like I'm

865
00:46:30,431 --> 00:46:33,460
painfully aware and increasingly aware,
I would say,

866
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,440
of of just how much,

867
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:39,730
I don't know how much more I need to be
reading and concentrating on to flesh

868
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,400
out what I have to say.
Like, I don't know,

869
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,090
I don't know enough about economics,
barely anything.

870
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,910
I don't know a lot about history,
barely anything.

871
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,350
And so I'm more and more aware
of how much I don't know.

872
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:57,160
And now I don't know if that's the kind
of blind spot that you were thinking of,

873
00:46:57,161 --> 00:47:00,580
but, but, but it, it,
it, it's terrifying to,

874
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,850
to comprehend that and still try to
move forward in this sort of space.

875
00:47:04,070 --> 00:47:06,300
It makes it tough to be a
public person these days. Right?

876
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:09,180
Because everyone wants you
to know everything about
everything, all the problems

877
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,600
that Eric was just describing,
which is, you know,

878
00:47:11,601 --> 00:47:16,070
the reason that people won't contend with
you is because you forced them to move

879
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:21,020
from their low resolution ideological
uncertainties into domains where specific

880
00:47:21,021 --> 00:47:24,350
knowledge is necessary. You instantly
exposed everyone's ignorance.

881
00:47:24,351 --> 00:47:25,230
It's like that's,

882
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:28,250
that's hard on the people that
you're having the discussion with.

883
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,430
But the devil is in the details.

884
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:32,140
Until the last sentence.

885
00:47:32,141 --> 00:47:35,080
I would say that I would
love you to shorten that and
put it on a bumper sticker

886
00:47:35,081 --> 00:47:39,140
for me. It was a brilliant summary.
Yeah. Blind spots. Shapiro. I mean,

887
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:43,420
I find it hard to argue with, with
any of that. I think that, you know,

888
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,760
if you're intellectually curious,
then that means that you know,

889
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:50,440
that you don't know anything. Um, so I, I
agree with, with everything you just said.

890
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:55,080
I mean, as far as other intellectual
blind spots, I mean, uh,

891
00:47:55,090 --> 00:47:56,380
or other blind spots generally.

892
00:47:56,381 --> 00:48:01,381
I would say that for me the
constant struggle is I find
myself more stressed out

893
00:48:02,201 --> 00:48:04,630
now than I was two years ago when no
one gave a crap when I thought, right.

894
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:08,850
I mean, that's so, so the fact is
that I, it's, you know, living a,

895
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,160
a less stressful life in the middle of
believing that people actually care what

896
00:48:14,741 --> 00:48:17,850
you think it means. You have to
take your stuff much more seriously.

897
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:20,380
That's not really a blind
spot as much as a concern. Uh,

898
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,920
and I think that that means that, you
know, just the, the commitment to,

899
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:28,060
to hearing more about things is,
is deeply necessary.

900
00:48:28,061 --> 00:48:29,350
But it also means that
it just means that you,

901
00:48:29,351 --> 00:48:31,660
your life in many ways is more miserable,
more people know about you.

902
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,070
And it's not a poor me thing. I love what
I do. I love the fact that people care.

903
00:48:36,071 --> 00:48:39,050
And I think like that's what I live.
But it wasn't really, I mean it's,

904
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:41,420
it's pretty sweet. You got a lot
of good stuff going on. No, I got,

905
00:48:41,421 --> 00:48:44,990
I got a ton of great stuff going on, but
the fact is that I spent, I spent the,

906
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,190
the risk is higher then in some
ways that makes you a better person.

907
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,340
It's almost like the, you know, the, the,

908
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,910
the old kind of religious Logan that
if you feel God is watching you all the

909
00:48:51,911 --> 00:48:54,040
time, then you're more likely
to, to be a better person.

910
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:56,290
And there is that feeling like,
okay, if I make a mistake,

911
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:58,840
I'd want to be the first person to notice
that I made the mistake and correct

912
00:48:58,841 --> 00:48:59,590
that mistake.

913
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:02,740
But that also means that you live with
a lot more self doubt and a lot more

914
00:49:02,741 --> 00:49:06,540
second guessing of yourself and you did
a, you know, when nobody cared. So it's,

915
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:08,920
so that, that's not as much
of a blind spot is concerned.

916
00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:11,440
The problem with trying to identify your
own blind spots that they're in your

917
00:49:11,441 --> 00:49:13,200
blind spot. Um, but it's,

918
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:15,490
that's why I asked the question I
wanted to make you pick a little bit.

919
00:49:15,491 --> 00:49:19,180
It's funny because just the other day
it was yesterday actually I did the Adam

920
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,290
Carolla podcast, which he's, you know,

921
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,350
it's comedy and he's doing more of a radio
show thing so you speak a little more

922
00:49:23,351 --> 00:49:27,220
freely and I was about to say something
very politically incorrect and I

923
00:49:27,221 --> 00:49:29,050
obviously don't have a
problem doing that generally,

924
00:49:29,051 --> 00:49:32,970
especially when I'm doing comedy and just
for a moment I had you sort of ringing

925
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:35,420
in my head about be careful about
your words and I was like, ah,

926
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:39,880
I just don't feel like offering up
one extra kind of fun that way. Right,

927
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:42,640
because like the stuff that you
felt like you could say a year ago,

928
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,900
now you realize not only maybe you
shouldn't have said it a year ago,

929
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,970
but also you feel like if I, if
am I, you're constantly saying,

930
00:49:51,971 --> 00:49:55,390
am I curbing myself because I'm afraid
or am I cribbing myself because it's the

931
00:49:55,391 --> 00:49:56,710
right thing to do to curb myself here?

932
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:59,500
And that's an interesting sort of
calculus you have to do all the time.

933
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,590
If you're concerned that
it's because of fear,

934
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:06,170
then you might want to take the risk of
saying it. You know, cause I've, I've,

935
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:09,130
I've tried, wrestled with that
problem is like, you know,

936
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,250
or maybe am I avoiding this because I
think it's better because I don't want to

937
00:50:12,251 --> 00:50:15,490
take on the responsibility.
If you have suspicions about that,

938
00:50:15,491 --> 00:50:17,710
then you should do it
because I think you should,

939
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:21,700
I should think you should arm yourself
against your weaknesses and take that

940
00:50:21,701 --> 00:50:24,790
risk. I think it's better
developmentally to do that. All right.

941
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,350
I'll answer or answer it for myself,

942
00:50:26,351 --> 00:50:28,040
which is a cue off
something your brother said

943
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,560
to me one shoe, which is, uh,

944
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,740
that perhaps I have a
little PTSD from the left.

945
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:38,900
So my focus on these completely
bananas ideas has been,

946
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,960
has been so singularly stuck in my mind
that maybe let some other things slide

947
00:50:44,031 --> 00:50:47,020
every now and again. I'm trying to be
very aware of that and trying to, uh,

948
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:49,070
figure out how to go forward on that show.

949
00:50:49,071 --> 00:50:51,650
Does that mean you're a little bit more
on the attack then you'd like to be?

950
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:55,130
Because I think I want to ease up on
a little bit of the attack on that.

951
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:58,310
I think I've spent the last couple of
years really it was first me identifying

952
00:50:58,311 --> 00:50:59,780
it for myself.
Really.

953
00:50:59,781 --> 00:51:04,670
I was interviewing all of these people
and figuring out that they were often

954
00:51:04,671 --> 00:51:09,370
going through the same thing I was, but
then it morphed into going on the attack.

955
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,420
Got It.
And now I feel like because,

956
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:15,620
and again I say the word winning with
you know a little tongue in cheek,

957
00:51:15,621 --> 00:51:18,920
but because I do send something
has turned here, that may be,

958
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:23,180
I can get my foot off the gas a little
bit on that and focus on the big ideas

959
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:26,570
that I really care about that in
relationship to this whole group.

960
00:51:26,570 --> 00:51:27,500
It might be nice.

961
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,090
I think we should really be careful
to use minimum necessary forest. Yeah,

962
00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:36,410
there's, there's idiocy on the left
and on the on the extreme right.

963
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:37,640
That needs to be pointed out,

964
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:43,030
but it might be better if
we did the minimum necessary
amount of that because it

965
00:51:43,761 --> 00:51:44,950
also starts to become same.

966
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:49,130
Something you can parody quite easily
at some point and more and more of

967
00:51:49,131 --> 00:51:53,090
delineating what the alternative might
be if there was a positive alternative.

968
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:53,450
Right.

969
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,940
Cause it's like you see that it will be
interesting to see what happens with the

970
00:51:55,941 --> 00:52:00,350
IDW as it moves beyond the
critique because what's
really unified as I think has

971
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:04,010
been a lot the critique
intersectionality and identity politics.

972
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:07,160
And once we move into the space where
we're actually trying to maybe build

973
00:52:07,161 --> 00:52:10,280
something together or come to some
sort of ideological continents, uh,

974
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:14,360
then some of these, some of these
healthy, what I hope is the difficult,

975
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:15,770
we capitulate the arguments.

976
00:52:15,770 --> 00:52:18,200
I hope that recapitulate the
arguments and more reasonable,

977
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,630
cogent and intelligent way. Uh, you know,

978
00:52:20,631 --> 00:52:23,270
in terms of the actual political
arguments. But I'm not sure that those,

979
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:24,980
I think that none of us,

980
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,250
I hope are dreaming that
there will actually be an
ideological continents among

981
00:52:28,251 --> 00:52:31,730
the lot of us. It was clearly
that is something that that
is not going to happen.

982
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:31,911
I mean,

983
00:52:31,911 --> 00:52:35,150
we all have significant disagreements
among ourselves on all of these issues.

984
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:36,320
But how beautiful that is,

985
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:39,100
that we're all kind of working
through it in our own way and we're,

986
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:41,690
we're all not going to get
to the exact same ending,

987
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:46,010
but we'll kind of go with each other
the whole time. Blind spot done.

988
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,100
Oh my gosh. Uh, it's more
or less infinite. Um,

989
00:52:49,370 --> 00:52:52,250
I think that I do a terrible job of,
um,

990
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:55,190
when somebody is making
a bed analytic argument,

991
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:57,530
but as intuitive their way
to the right conclusion,

992
00:52:57,560 --> 00:53:02,170
I tend to discount them as if
the analytic argument was how,

993
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:05,820
how they should be thinking. So
different kinds of minds, um,

994
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,510
who have their variables.
You know, if you've,

995
00:53:08,570 --> 00:53:10,190
if you think nothing of Myers Briggs,

996
00:53:10,191 --> 00:53:12,950
it should at least tell you that there
are kinds of minds that aren't working at

997
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:15,080
all. Like yours. Big Five
might be a little bit better.

998
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:19,430
So that's been a huge blind
spot. I think that, um,

999
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:24,590
I am very focused on provable,
um,

1000
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:27,180
institutional betrayal,

1001
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:32,220
which I can point at and no one else
seems to want to talk about and that

1002
00:53:32,221 --> 00:53:37,221
because no one wants to talk about
a really specific problems with the

1003
00:53:37,411 --> 00:53:39,480
institutions.
Um,

1004
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,680
it leads me sometimes to
not seeing the generic case.

1005
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:47,910
I think that I am very much a
prisoner of my learning disability.

1006
00:53:47,911 --> 00:53:51,660
I had to sort of construct
my own operating system to
get around them. Otherwise,

1007
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:56,250
if you ever want to see something funny,
asked Bret Weinstein to read aloud, um,

1008
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:57,141
because you could,

1009
00:53:57,141 --> 00:54:00,270
you just see that he's
having to impressionistically
figure out what's on the

1010
00:54:00,271 --> 00:54:04,740
page because he's not tracking it.
Exactly. So I think that, um, you know,

1011
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,770
that fight, uh, to say I'm not stupid, uh,

1012
00:54:07,830 --> 00:54:12,210
probably distorted me a great deal.
I'm having to build my own architecture.

1013
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:13,800
Uh,
and I think,

1014
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:18,450
I think we can safely say are not
stupid. So I think one last thing. Yeah.

1015
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:23,530
And I think that one of the things
that are most worried about is that I'm

1016
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:28,280
fighting the supposedly empathic army
of people trying to destroy conversation

1017
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:33,281
itself has had a very negative impact on
my empathy for exactly the people that

1018
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,500
they want me to have empathy for.

1019
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,180
And I think that it's very important
for all of us, um, to say, okay,

1020
00:54:41,181 --> 00:54:43,160
what's the steel manning of that position?

1021
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,990
And to make an extra effort when people
are making absolutely non empathic

1022
00:54:47,991 --> 00:54:48,501
arguments,

1023
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:52,580
trying to destroy you and fry you to
think about the empathy that you want to

1024
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:57,020
have for whatever went wrong in their
lives. Might be fun at some point. Um,

1025
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:02,410
to conjure up a panel where some of the
people that are in this group take the

1026
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,160
leftist position and defend it

1027
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:12,350
in every possible way, you know,
right from the postmodern conclusions,

1028
00:55:12,351 --> 00:55:16,790
which you know, I think are are worthy
of substantial skepticism to the,

1029
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:21,590
to the notion of the reality of the
dispossessed and they and the presence of

1030
00:55:21,591 --> 00:55:23,990
systemic oppression
and all of that and to,

1031
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:28,900
and to make the cases as as brutally as
we possibly can with acquity useful like

1032
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,040
another I will, I will
not steal man, those tech,

1033
00:55:32,550 --> 00:55:35,210
not the tactics we have to come
with you because then we could,

1034
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:38,480
cause it doesn't seem like we've been
able to have the debate with anybody who

1035
00:55:38,481 --> 00:55:42,320
can carry the debate. So it
might be really useful to
it and I have been trying,

1036
00:55:42,321 --> 00:55:43,070
but it's,
it's,

1037
00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:46,400
it's hard because we're spending
most of our energy fending off by,

1038
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,730
I think we've all tried, attacked the
tactics. That's exactly the point.

1039
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:52,130
It's not the conclusions. All
right, we got to move on. Jordan.

1040
00:55:52,131 --> 00:55:55,700
I or are going to a long beach tonight.
You're going to San Francisco,

1041
00:55:55,701 --> 00:55:58,310

1044
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:07,310
God can't share every boring who runs
the place. Uh, it is, um, the x scribble,

1045
00:56:07,311 --> 00:56:10,180
Michael Knowles,
Andrew Klavan and Jordan Peterson.

1046
