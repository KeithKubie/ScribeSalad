00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.680
We've built a Universe Matrix, and we did
it without Keanu.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.490
It's everything astronomical scientists could
ever want.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:18.250
Which has led them, inexorably, here.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.250
Howdy y'all, Trace here for DNews with your
weekly space update!

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.420
We've done it!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.940
We've created a computer simulated universe
using 13 billion years, 41,000 galaxies, 350

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:33.610
million light-years wide -- this simulation
is the largest most accurate EVER and ... what

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:34.980
is it for again?

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.600
Scientists have gathered reams of information
on our universe over the last few centuries,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.050
how it moves, interconnects, reacts, grows
and changes.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.760
We have theories about how it was formed,
how parts of it die, and how things behave!

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.970
But they're scattered through tons of books,
papers and human brains.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.290
This stimulated universe, called "Illustris,"
is a way to put ALL these theories in one

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.070
place and run experiments to check if these
vast hypotheses are correct.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:06.130
This is like a SimUniverse game... the researchers
can go forward or backward in time, from 12

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.780
million years after The Big Bang, all the
way to what we can see today.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.299
As time flies in the simulation, scientists
can track the formation of galaxies and follow

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.789
how we think the universe came to be.

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.579
This has been REALLY tough to create before
now because our understanding of dark energy

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.770
and dark matter is a HUGE variable.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.219
That dark stuff makes up 95% of the universe,
so getting it right in the simulation without

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.749
ever directly observing it is pretty tough,
but the guys at MIT where the simulation lives

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:37.749
are confident.

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.250
The best part about this simulation is the
tracking of the big stuff, like spiral and

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.789
elliptical galaxies, and small stuff like
protons, electrons and neutrons.

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.770
Seriously, that's all in there.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.461
It takes a supercomputer to run it.

00:01:54.461 --> 00:02:01.840
It uses 8,192 CPUs to render the graphics
for the simulator and it took six months to

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.569
chug through all 13 billion years.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.989
All this aside, these scientists aren't perfect,
and they know their amazing computer program

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.709
isn't perfect either, but it's a huge step
toward understanding how galaxies form and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.709
interact.

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:24.980
Each particle of gas in the simulator is 1
MILLION SOLAR MASSES -- like one million suns.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.750
Like early digital cameras, it's tough to
pick up ALL the details when you take a picture

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.090
-- but that doesn't mean you can't see the
image.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.500
Scientists are already finding things wrong
and calling them out, because science -- we're

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.500
not afraid to be wrong.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.939
This lil SimUniverse doesn't form low-mass
galaxy stars at the right time and they can't

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.140
model massive galaxy clusters -- but that's
due to minimum computer requirements.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.140
Dammit.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.030
Time to get a new graphics card... or 8,129
of them.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.019
If you had eight thousands computers what
kind of science would you want to simulate?
