00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.689
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:07.480
BILL CRAWFORD: Thanks
everybody for coming.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.350
This is the Talks
at Google series.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.880
We are very, very lucky to have
with us today Frances Stroh,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.440
the author of "Beer Money: A
Memoir Of Privilege And Loss."

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.020
And we thought we
would kick it off

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.650
with having Frances do
a reading from the book.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.910
Frances, thank you so
much for being here.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.534
FRANCES STROH: Thank
you so much, Bill.

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:31.150
It's a great
pleasure to be here.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.120
I obviously wrote a book about
what it was like growing up

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.380
in the Stroh family--

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.990
a big growing
family in Detroit--

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.420
beginning in 1850.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.940
And I thought maybe
I would just talk

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.160
a little bit about the
trajectory of the business

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.864
before I--

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:48.780
BILL CRAWFORD: Please.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.162
FRANCES STROH: --settle into--

00:00:49.162 --> 00:00:49.548
BILL CRAWFORD: Absolutely,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.600
FRANCES STROH: --a reading,
because it will just

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.460
give a little bit
of context to what

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.550
I'm going to read, which
is actually personal,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.940
family-oriented passage.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.820
So my great great
grandfather, Bernhard Stroh,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.390
came over from Germany in
1848 with a family recipe--

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.650
beer recipe, his family
had made in Germany--

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.260
and $150 in his pocket.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.980
And he settled in
Detroit in 1850.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.440
And he started brewing
beer in his basement.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.640
And he sold it door-to-door
out of a wheelbarrow.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.650
And he saved every spare penny
to buy a horse-drawn carriage.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.380
He took the company
through prohibition

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.030
with his sons Julius
and Bernhard Jr.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.310
They really took
over at that point,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.220
and took the company
through prohibition

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.240
by selling malt syrup
for homebrewing purposes.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.070
This was legal
during prohibition.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.892
BILL CRAWFORD: Nice
loophole, yeah--

00:01:47.892 --> 00:01:47.969
FRANCES STROH: Yes--

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:48.885
BILL CRAWFORD: --yeah.

00:01:48.885 --> 00:01:51.270
FRANCES STROH: It was a
great loophole for many.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.650
And also Stroh's ice
cream they started

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.610
producing during
prohibition, which

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.040
helped the family get through.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.900
Julius, my great
grandfather, bought out

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.330
his brother's share
of the company

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.100
during the Prohibition years.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.550
He was a really smart guy.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.850
He bought the shares
for almost nothing.

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.840
And then the company
went gangbusters

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.240
when Prohibition was repealed
under Julius' continued reign.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.100
And then my
grandfather, Gary Stroh,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.970
took over the business
just before World War II.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.180
And there was a very stubborn
streak in the Stroh family,

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.160
which is one of the reasons the
company survived in the family

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.080
for five generations.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.340
And this really presented
itself in Gary's case,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.590
when hops and wheat were
rationed during the war.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.140
And Gary refused to water
down the beer formula

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.540
to keep volumes up, as every
other US brewer did, and really

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.080
just sold less beer,
but stuck to his guns,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.350
and kept the strong beer taste.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.160
Ironically, after the war
ended, American beer tastes

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.900
had changed.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.510
And American consumers had
really, sort of, gravitated

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.340
at that point towards
the more watery beer.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.940
Which is why Europeans made fun
of us for having watery beer.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.890
Which of course is changing now
with the craft brew industry.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.090
But in those days, people
wanted the watery taste.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.330
When my great Uncle John
took over the company

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:31.650
after Gary died, he
watered down the beer.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.550
Again the company
went up exponentially.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.660
They bought Goebel.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.870
They buy other brewers
in the Detroit area.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.160
And then my uncle, Peter
Stroh, took the company over

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.990
in the late '70s, and decided to
grow through major acquisition

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.190
rather than small acquisition,
and, sort of, incrementally,

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.150
as we had done.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.350
We were regional Midwestern
brewers still in the late '70s.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.620
And what Peter decided to do was
purchase much larger companies

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.450
than Stroh's.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.010
He purchased Schlitz.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.780
He purchased Shaefer
in the early '80s.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.890
We were $100 million market cap.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.290
Schlitz was five times our size.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.850
We took out a half a billion
dollar loan to buy it.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:20.730
[WHISTLE]

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.530
And suddenly, we were a
big national powerhouse.

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.630
But we're still
family-owned and operated.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.480
We were number three in
size behind Anheuser-Busch

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.070
and Miller.

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.540
And we-- people ask all
the time, what went wrong?

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.270
Well, our company
culture was still

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.020
family-owned and operated,
family-run board, still

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.430
sort of a regional
brewing mentality.

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.710
And overnight we were national.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.630
We had breweries all
over the country.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.780
And we didn't have
the marketing budget

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.450
to go that big that quickly.

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:59.880
So a variety of other
factors impacted

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.280
our success between 1982 and
1991, when we were Forbes 400,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.200
and suddenly went from
being huge and seemingly

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.920
successful to almost
broke in about 10 years.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.690
So that's really the,
sort of, thumbnail sketch

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.130
of what happened.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.940
My book is about what it was
like growing up in the Stroh

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:28.440
family during those
years in the '70s,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.670
'80s, and '90s, when the
company was really big,

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.360
and then lost everything,
and sold for scraps to Pabst

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.010
in the late '90s.

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:39.740
It's my coming of age
story as an artist,

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.290
as someone who is, sort
of, reflecting the family's

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:46.090
story in a variety
of ways in my work.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.830
And it ties in the
fall out on the family,

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.520
in my branch of
the Stroh family,

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.660
what was happening
to the family members

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:01.220
as this beer story
was unfolding.

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.470
So that will bring me to this
passage, which takes place

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.920
in Grosse Pointe in 1980.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.690
I was 13 years old at the time.

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.700
The December light
faded so suddenly I

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.610
could hardly read my own words.

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.920
Rather than switch
on the chandelier,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.830
I slid my high school
application essay

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.720
across the dining table
closer to the bay window.

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.030
Snow was beginning to fall.

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.490
The empty house
creaked around me

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.520
as I bore down on my
paragraphs, determined

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.740
to get down exactly how things
had felt the summer before,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.300
when everything changed--

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.570
it seemed-- overnight.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.560
I wrote about my parents'
faces, pale and swollen

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.160
with sleeplessness,
and the knotted feeling

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.770
inside my stomach.

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.170
Something terrible
was happening.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.900
My mother had given
up playing backgammon.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.530
My father had stopped
leaving for work.

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.370
I described the hushed
voices, the closed doors,

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.750
my gnawing sense that everything
would come apart at any moment,

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.610
that only a barely discernible
tensing of all my muscles

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.100
might hold it together.

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.370
My parents sealed themselves
in the library for days.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.400
Whatever you do, my
father said as he

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:37.190
pulled the door behind
him, do not come in here.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:41.480
Whitney and I sat on the porch
watching TV, our blank faces

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.090
masking our alarm,
buoyed at least

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:50.840
partly by "The Brady Bunch,"
"Bewitched," "Happy Days."

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:54.260
My younger brother's auburn
hair was oddly disheveled,

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.900
his trousers an inch too short.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.950
How I envied my older brothers,
both of them off to college,

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:05.870
Charlie a sophomore,
and Bobby senior.

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:11.020
On day three, my parents
emerged drained, older,

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:16.520
yet united in their conviction
that we should know the truth.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:20.360
It's so awful to have to tell
you this, my mother began

00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:24.430
in a cracked voice, the puffed
wedges underneath her eyes

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:26.990
by now a deep purple.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.730
But it's important you know.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.840
Your brother Charlie
is a drug dealer.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.679
Her eyes filled up with
tears and she looked away.

00:08:36.679 --> 00:08:40.190
My father dragged down his
cigarette dismissively.

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.100
We're taking him out of college,
putting him into the Marines

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:45.920
to clean him up.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.410
As my mother wept, my
father put his cigarette

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.530
into the ash tray, and
gently rested both his hands

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.570
on her shoulders.

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:58.280
I couldn't remember the last
time I'd seen them touch.

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.880
You must never mention a
word about this to anyone

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.900
outside the family, my
mother said to Whitney and me

00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:09.260
with unusual sternness,
wiping her cheeks

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:15.140
with the back of her
hand, nobody at all.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:17.870
I felt the news and
accompanying emotions

00:09:17.870 --> 00:09:20.900
seal themselves
off inside my body

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:25.850
with the ease of a
closing elevator door.

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.530
Drug dealers were
something you saw

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.610
on TV, not in my own family.

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.670
I remembered an episode of
"Starsky &amp; Hutch," where

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.250
the drug dealer lived in
an abandoned apartment

00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:39.380
on the outskirts of town.

00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:44.660
Starsky kicked in the door
while Hutch aimed the gun.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:48.890
I turned on the chandelier, so
that I could reread my essay.

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:51.380
Outside, the snow was
falling harder now,

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:56.600
and a few stray sparrows pecked
aimlessly at the frozen ground.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.750
My last winter in Michigan--

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:02.780
next year I'd be gone,
away at boarding school

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.380
for ninth grade,
and away from house.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:09.560
I'd been waiting to
go since sixth grade,

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:12.800
counting down the
years impatiently.

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.500
The applications all
asked for an essay

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:20.040
on an experience that
had changed my life.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.620
And so while other
eighth graders

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:24.770
wrote about their
golden retrievers dying,

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.780
I wrote about
Charlie's drug bust,

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.510
and what I had done
to our family--

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:32.690
the shame and silence
spreading from my parents

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:37.355
to us, and then into just about
every aspect of our lives.

00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:43.370
Charlie had been selling
cocaine, a drug I knew about

00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:45.500
from Time Magazine.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.060
I'd seen pictures of it-- lines
of white powder on the cover.

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:53.300
My parents had heard the news
from Charlie's college dean

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.450
earlier that year in the Spring.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:11:00.080
He was expelled, and under
pressure from my parents

00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:04.250
immediately enrolled in
Marine boot camp in San Diego,

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.740
leaving in early June.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:11.310
But as June passed into July,
everything kept changing.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:13.865
And the tension in the
house got only worse.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.410
So at the end of the
summer, my parents

00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:22.370
go out to San Diego for
Charlie's boot camp graduation.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:27.830
On the day of the
ceremony, as I heard later,

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.990
my parents waited
in the auditorium,

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:33.140
holding their programs,
eager to see Charlie graduate

00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:35.630
into his new life,
desperate to put

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.990
the whole ordeal behind them.

00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:42.680
But when the Marines finally
filed in, clean and spiffed up

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:46.160
in their blue uniforms and
broad-brimmed marine hats,

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.690
my parents noticed that
Charlie was not among them.

00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:53.420
Confused, my father
walked up the aisle

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.610
to look into the hallway.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:59.990
There was Charlie, stiff
with fear in his uniform,

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:05.810
handcuffed and surrounded
by several federal agents.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.210
My father went back
into the auditorium,

00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.090
and took my mother
out by the arm.

00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.840
Charlie was gone-- done for.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.210
They drove back to
La Jolla, my mother

00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:20.840
in tears, my father
shocked and humiliated,

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:23.480
both of them determined to
conceal from their hosts what

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.010
had happened.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.540
Their worst nightmare
was unfolding.

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:30.590
Charlie's drug dealing would
surely make it into the papers

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:34.880
now, especially if he
ended up in prison.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.940
Everyone in Grosse
Pointe would know--

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.560
everyone, everywhere.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.590
I think I'll stop there.

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:49.739
BILL CRAWFORD: Thank you,
that's some powerful stuff.

00:12:49.739 --> 00:12:50.780
FRANCES STROH: Thank you.

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:55.160
BILL CRAWFORD: So, something
that stuck out to me--

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.980
you know, your father
coming out and saying,

00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.190
you know, tell no one-- right,
I mean, for obvious reasons.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.611
It could bring embarrassment.

00:13:02.611 --> 00:13:03.110
And--

00:13:03.110 --> 00:13:03.560
FRANCES STROH: Of course.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.660
BILL CRAWFORD: --it's
understandable.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.330
So natural next question--

00:13:09.330 --> 00:13:11.450
you wrote a book.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.460
You wrote a book all about it.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.130
And I know your father
is no longer with us.

00:13:16.130 --> 00:13:20.360
But your mother still with
us, and several other family

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.240
members, right?

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:27.359
So what has been the
reaction from your family?

00:13:27.359 --> 00:13:28.400
FRANCES STROH: Well, my--

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.840
Charlie is no longer with us.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.840
My father is no longer with us.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:35.630
My mother has been an
incredible support.

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:38.240
She's really had my
back from the beginning,

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.710
and, you know, handed
gallies out to her friends,

00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:45.020
read the book out
loud to a friend

00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:47.360
of hers who's lost her sight.

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.960
She comes to as many of
my events as she can.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.460
So--

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:50.870
BILL CRAWFORD: That's nice.

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:51.403
FRANCES STROH:
--she's been amazing.

00:13:51.403 --> 00:13:51.920
BILL CRAWFORD: That's great.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.065
FRANCES STROH: And--

00:13:52.065 --> 00:13:52.550
BILL CRAWFORD: Awesome.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:54.320
FRANCES STROH: I
would say overall,

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.817
it's been positive-- the
relatives who I've heard from.

00:13:56.817 --> 00:13:57.650
BILL CRAWFORD: Sure.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.233
FRANCES STROH: The
book really focuses

00:13:59.233 --> 00:14:02.930
on my branch of the Stroh
family, although it ties

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.060
in, of course, the
trajectory of the business,

00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:09.770
and what happened, and how that
was tied to Detroit's destiny,

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:12.320
and, sort of, the
decimation of Detroit.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.200
And some of the losses the
family experienced financially

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.880
was connected with that.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.580
So it's all connected.

00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:25.470
And yet the beauty of the
timing of when the story ends--

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.740
the story ends in 2009.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.000
And by the time the book
was being published,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.410
Detroit's Renaissance was in
the throes of its heights.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:37.910
I mean--

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:38.300
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.670
FRANCES STROH: It's really
come together tremendously

00:14:40.670 --> 00:14:43.282
in Detroit during the
time that the book was,

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:44.990
sort of, in the works
with the publisher.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.270
And so it's been an
exciting period to,

00:14:47.270 --> 00:14:50.330
sort of, come-- bring the
book forward at this time,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.480
and also with Pabst relaunching
Stroh's beer in Detroit,

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:59.157
and everything that has, sort
of, really coalesced there.

00:14:59.157 --> 00:14:59.990
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.680
Yeah, no-- that's-- it's
almost like a nice way to, kind

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.560
of, look back on where
we came from as a city,

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.770
and Southeastern
Michigan as a whole.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.210
So I mean, so on that, right--

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.950
I mean, near the
end of the book,

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.870
there is a little talk of
the decline of Detroit.

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:20.980
And you kind of said it.

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.440
But I mean, there is--
there's some kernels

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.180
of hope at the end.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.130
And I think that that
has really kind of

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:30.514
been the harbinger in a great
way of all the great things

00:15:30.514 --> 00:15:31.305
that are happening.

00:15:31.305 --> 00:15:32.471
FRANCES STROH: That's right.

00:15:32.471 --> 00:15:35.230
Yeah, I mention Music of
Contemporary Art Detroit,

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.660
the new wing at
the DIA, the fact

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:39.400
that the artists are moving in.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.570
And really, it's always
when the artists come in,

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.440
we know that the city is coming
back, because then, you know,

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:48.910
the buzz starts to happen.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.110
The restaurants come in.

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.410
The cafes, the
galleries, everything--

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:55.979
artists are always, sort of,
the canaries in the coal mine.

00:15:55.979 --> 00:15:56.770
BILL CRAWFORD: Yes.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.100
FRANCES STROH: So and of course
that was inspiring to me.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.120
And as-- in that last scene
in the book, where my--

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.890
we've just left in
my father's funeral.

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.320
We're driving downtown.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:11.200
We're watching-- you know,
seeing the places where

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.910
the houses are
being knocked down,

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:16.860
where there are holes
in neighborhoods.

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.700
The vegetables in
the gardens are

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.890
being planted to
make up for the fact

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:24.160
that there were no
grocery chains in 2009.

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.040
And of course that's all
changed dramatically.

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:33.940
But this feeling of rebirth,
and hope, and a resilience, that

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:39.410
really has been such a hallmark
of how I have lived my life.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:41.740
I've wanted to-- and you
know, as I carved out my own

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.370
identity-- sort of separate
from the Stroh family story,

00:16:45.370 --> 00:16:48.869
but then return to
it later in life--

00:16:48.869 --> 00:16:49.660
BILL CRAWFORD: Sure

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:51.880
FRANCES STROH: --as I
have, to write the book,

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:56.050
and sort of reclaim that
history and my own way.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:17:01.030
So Detroit I think has done
that in its own sense, as well.

00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.830
And it's been an
amazing thing to watch.

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:05.920
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah, no,
it's exciting for those

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.010
of us that are here living it.

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:12.280
So with that happening,
I mean, the timing

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:16.150
is serendipitous of
you writing the book.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:18.849
Is that what spurred
you to write the book?

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:21.690
Or was there other factors
that drove you to-- it's

00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:22.900
like, why now?

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.520
Why tell your story now?

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.920
FRANCES STROH: Well it
wasn't necessarily related

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.030
to what was going on
in Detroit at all.

00:17:29.030 --> 00:17:30.430
In fact, when I
started the book,

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.320
nobody was talking
about Detroit.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:35.540
It was right-- probably,
it was pre-bankruptcy.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.706
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah, or if--

00:17:36.706 --> 00:17:36.845
FRANCES STROH: That's when--

00:17:36.845 --> 00:17:38.428
BILL CRAWFORD: --they
were it wasn't--

00:17:38.428 --> 00:17:41.050
FRANCES STROH: --national
attention started to, sort of,

00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.860
really focus itself on
Detroit around the time

00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.420
of the bankruptcy.

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.220
I was writing the
book because it

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.830
was a story I felt I'd always
known I wanted to write.

00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:58.450
And somehow, when
my father died,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.890
it opened the doors to do that.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:00.870
There was just--

00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:04.000
I'd been working on a
novel for several years.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.760
Prior to that, I'd been
an installation artist--

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.060
and all through my 20s in fact.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.250
And because my work
was so narrative

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:17.410
based as an installation
artist, in fact I had done--

00:18:17.410 --> 00:18:20.680
the only piece I ever did
during those years that

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.010
involved family themes
was a piece that I

00:18:24.010 --> 00:18:26.770
describe in the
prologue to the book,

00:18:26.770 --> 00:18:29.410
where in a gallery space--

00:18:29.410 --> 00:18:31.990
in a room inside a gallery--
there is a piece that I made

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:35.080
with all six of my family
members telling the family

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:39.700
story from each of their, just
very disparate points of view--

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:44.140
all at the same time on
six video flat screen video

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:44.860
monitors.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.380
And it's this very
explosive experience

00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:49.660
in the center of the room
with all of these voices

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:50.970
overlapping.

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:57.490
And that really was
one of the seeds

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:01.690
for this book that came later.

00:19:01.690 --> 00:19:05.890
And perhaps even looking back on
the writing of the high school

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:10.060
application essay, the seeds for
the book were of course present

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.870
there, too.

00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:16.570
So there's been a creative
impulse for a long time,

00:19:16.570 --> 00:19:21.310
not just to tell my family
story and come to terms with it,

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:25.060
but just to, sort of,
penetrate the truth,

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:27.670
and really bring
things to light,

00:19:27.670 --> 00:19:30.430
and understand things
on a deeper level,

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.075
and create meaning
out of events.

00:19:32.075 --> 00:19:32.950
BILL CRAWFORD: Right.

00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.720
Right, and so--

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.740
I wouldn't put this
on you necessarily.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.580
I'll let you tell me.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.146
This has been a pretty
cathartic experience

00:19:42.146 --> 00:19:43.270
for you-- writing the book?

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:46.780
FRANCES STROH: I think that has
been one of the side effects

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.610
that has been wonderful.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:50.350
It was never the intention.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:53.470
But I did find through
the writing of the book

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:56.740
that I was able to make
connections between events

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:59.000
that I had never made before.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.370
And the book is--

00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:04.840
the story is told in a
very episodic way, where

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.210
each chapter is
essentially a snapshot

00:20:07.210 --> 00:20:10.810
either of a period in my own
life, or in the family's,

00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:11.740
or both.

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:12.880
I mean, I'm the narrator.

00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.600
I'm always present for
these events in the story.

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:23.380
And so figuring out what those
events were very emblematic

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:24.940
of the overall story--

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.100
because of course, the part
stands in for the whole

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.790
in a book like this--

00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:34.660
was an interesting process.

00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.030
When I think about that
drive down into Detroit

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.950
as a teenager with
friends, and we'd

00:20:38.950 --> 00:20:43.840
go and walk around the abandoned
Uniroyal tire plant, which

00:20:43.840 --> 00:20:46.900
of course is something
that Detroiters

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.040
I guess have always done--

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:48.640
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah
it's a little bit

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.810
of a right of passage for--

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:50.360
FRANCES STROH: Continue to do.

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.070
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.861
FRANCES STROH: Yes.

00:20:51.861 --> 00:20:54.760
these old warehouses,
and old factories

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.760
are places that kids
still love to explore.

00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.000
So we were doing that
back in the mid '80s.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.710
And a so that drive
down to Detroit--

00:21:05.710 --> 00:21:09.340
the experience of going in,
breaking in to this enormous--

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:13.800
almost city within a city-- the
abandoned Uniroyal tire plant--

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.160
and taking pictures.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.480
We were all artists.

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.150
We were all, sort of,
reading the same books.

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.850
And then we go back
to Grosse Pointe

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:25.300
and, like, re-enter the fold
of our families' worlds, which

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.530
were so different.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.500
And the contrast from
Detroit, Grosse Pointe--

00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.920
you know, being with
friends, being with family--

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.900
all of that,
especially in my world,

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:42.141
it was sort of as if Detroit
was this escape that I really

00:21:42.141 --> 00:21:42.640
needed.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.800
I needed-- you
know, my father had

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.710
been an astonishingly
talented photographer.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.310
I sort of carried that
torch forward in high school

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.130
and beyond.

00:21:52.130 --> 00:21:54.550
And my father had gone
into the family business

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:57.580
instead of pursuing his dream
of being a photographer.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.150
And a lot of Stroh
family members, I feel,

00:22:01.150 --> 00:22:02.110
were pressured.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:04.780
The men were pressured
to join the business,

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.740
didn't follow their dreams,
didn't necessarily play things

00:22:08.740 --> 00:22:11.200
out, and carve out their
own identities in the ways

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.250
that perhaps they
would have liked to.

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:20.350
And I see this as one of the
pitfalls of family businesses

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:21.460
in general.

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:25.120
But certainly, in my
own family, things

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:29.290
unfolded I think in
a particular way.

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:31.570
Because there were people
working at the company,

00:22:31.570 --> 00:22:34.501
people running the
company, who may not have

00:22:34.501 --> 00:22:36.250
really wanted to be
there-- who would have

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.960
preferred doing other things.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.376
BILL CRAWFORD:
That's interesting.

00:22:39.376 --> 00:22:41.200
So I have two questions on that.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.960
So-- the first being, and
you kind of touched on it--

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.820
I mean, hindsight being
what it is, what do you

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:51.880
think the Stroh family
could have done differently

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.045
to have kept in business.

00:22:53.045 --> 00:22:54.670
I mean, you touched
on it a little bit,

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.980
but I would love to get
your thoughts on that.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:01.060
FRANCES STROH: Sure, I feel that
during the '80s, certainly when

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.370
we went national, it was a big--

00:23:03.370 --> 00:23:05.920
it was-- my Uncle
Peter essentially

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.450
decided to bet the farm.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.220
It was his feeling that
we either had to grow--

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.900
"grow or go."

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.370
And that may have been true.

00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:22.300
But growing that quickly,
and without the marketing

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:27.370
budget to take those brands
national, and really this ethos

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:28.690
of wanting the--

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:32.230
wanting it to continue to be
family-owned and operated,

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:36.430
to have this company there
so that their sons could

00:23:36.430 --> 00:23:38.680
inherit it.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.640
It was the attachment.

00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.040
It was the over
identification with the brand

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:43.000
that was the problem.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.970
We got a million offer
in the early '80s

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:49.420
for the company, which the
family-run board turned down.

00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:50.170
Did I say million?

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:51.000
I meant billion.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.083
BILL CRAWFORD: Yeah I was
like, you know, Frances,

00:23:53.083 --> 00:23:55.185
it's probably good
they turned that down.

00:23:55.185 --> 00:23:56.810
FRANCES STROH: A
billion dollar offer--

00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.500
BILL CRAWFORD: Billion dollars.

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.583
FRANCES STROH: --which
back then, was $12 billion,

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.000
you know, in today's dollars--

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:01.270
BILL CRAWFORD: Easy.

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:03.810
FRANCES STROH: --if invested,
you know, in the S&amp;P--

00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:07.610
so turned it down.

00:24:07.610 --> 00:24:11.590
And I think the
over-identification certainly

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:17.710
was present then, and continued
to be as we fought to survive

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:18.970
for the next 10 years.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:22.870
Because almost as soon as the
offer was turned down, it--

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:27.790
things got pretty hairy in the
beer business, with price wars,

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:31.460
and shrinking margins, and
all kinds of other stuff.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.880
So I really feel that if they
wanted to stay in the business,

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.170
it would have been better.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:41.770
Like Bill Ford, he
knew when to step down

00:24:41.770 --> 00:24:45.160
bringing in outside management.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.590
We really didn't find the right
moment to, sort of, step aside,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:53.080
and decided that we'd be
better off if somebody else was

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.940
running it and not
a family member.

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.820
BILL CRAWFORD: Interesting,
and so the other

00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:01.270
question that you
spurred for me was,

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.881
so you had the males in the
Stroh family being encouraged--

00:25:04.881 --> 00:25:06.630
despite whatever their
other interests may

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:08.765
be-- to go into the business.

00:25:08.765 --> 00:25:10.140
But it seems like
from your book,

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.120
and things I've heard
you say, there wasn't

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.090
much of a path for the women.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.400
FRANCES STROH: No, the
patriarchal lines of succession

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.560
were fixed.

00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:22.510
That was how things were done.

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.300
And they-- I feel
as if, you know,

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:28.290
maybe it's more so in German
families than in others.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.370
I just read about a
brewer in Germany.

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.260
They've been around
for nine generations.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.930
And they just put the
first female family member

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:38.290
on the board.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:42.750
So this is very, very common
in family-run businesses.

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:45.370
I think it's starting to change.

00:25:45.370 --> 00:25:48.900
But no, the women in
the Stroh family or not

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:51.787
encouraged to join the business.

00:25:51.787 --> 00:25:52.912
BILL CRAWFORD: Interesting.

00:25:52.912 --> 00:25:53.240
FRANCES STROH: It just wasn't--

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:53.390
BILL CRAWFORD: Well--

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:54.045
FRANCES STROH: --part
of the conversation--

00:25:54.045 --> 00:25:55.290
BILL CRAWFORD: Maybe that
would have made the difference.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:25:55.860
Who knows?

00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:58.320
FRANCES STROH: Perhaps.

00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:01.050
BILL CRAWFORD: So
a lot of the book--

00:26:01.050 --> 00:26:02.940
just pivoting off the
business for a second--

00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:08.250
I want to talk
about entitlement.

00:26:08.250 --> 00:26:09.890
That's especially pertinent to--

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:12.750
I think sometimes, like,
at Google, we forget

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.340
how lucky we are sometimes.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:19.860
We're very, very lucky to
work at a place like this.

00:26:19.860 --> 00:26:22.260
In your book, you talk about
a lot of the family members

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:27.780
receiving their dividend
checks that were just coming.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.950
And, kind of, the expectation
was they would always come.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.220
You seem to have, kind
of, been able to get away

00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:36.480
from that entitlement.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.300
And it's clear you've instilled
that in your son, Mishka.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:43.740
How have you, kind of,
kept your head about that,

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:46.980
and been able to, kind
of, rise above the apathy

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:49.341
and entitlement?

00:26:49.341 --> 00:26:51.840
FRANCES STROH: Well, I think
my mother was extremely helpful

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:54.270
when we were young.

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.410
Well, to begin with, my
father was a big spender.

00:26:58.410 --> 00:26:59.802
He liked to live extravagantly.

00:26:59.802 --> 00:27:05.670
He was a big collector of
art and various objects,

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:10.770
antique firearms, vintage
Leica cameras, guitars.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:15.660
And my mother was very frugal,
and very careful with money.

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.210
Her motto was always
save for a rainy day.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.070
And she really conditioned
us to understand that.

00:27:23.070 --> 00:27:26.790
While she couldn't have known
what direction the company was

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:30.660
headed in, she certainly saw
that my father wasn't saving,

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:36.210
and that the future may
have not been so bright.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:40.200
And she made us, sort
of, integrate this

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.310
into the very fabric
of our outlook on life.

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:47.610
So there was a feeling
of potential scarcity,

00:27:47.610 --> 00:27:51.690
and at times real scarcity,
when she had to call our schools

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:53.810
and let them know the
tuition would arrive late,

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:55.890
or maybe even the phone
bill couldn't be paid,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.080
because of my father's
extravagances.

00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:58.920
BILL CRAWFORD: Wow.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.620
FRANCES STROH: And so
there was this feeling

00:28:01.620 --> 00:28:03.120
of great abundance--

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:05.160
in terms of what we
were surrounded with.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:09.270
And yet, sometime-- and then,
there were these kidnapping

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.670
drills, where my father would
take me out on the sidewalk

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:14.190
in front of the
house, and train me--

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:18.270
as a young child-- to learn
how to not be kidnapped.

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:19.980
He would circle a
car around the block

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:22.570
while I waited alone,
terrified on the sidewalk.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.800
And he would pull up next to
me and dangle a chocolate bar

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.480
out the window, and say--

00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.130
in a scary voice--

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.690
come here, little girl.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:32.730
And I would have run back
into the house crying,

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:35.140
as I'd been instructed to do.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.560
And the reason for these
drills, as he said,

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.730
was we couldn't afford
to pay the ransom.

00:28:41.730 --> 00:28:44.610
So there were very mixed
messages around money.

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:50.250
And so I feel as if I
internalized all of that.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:56.160
And as I got older, of course,
there was this drive to--

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:58.500
I was just naturally an artist.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.350
I always was for-- as a
young child, drawing--

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:05.040
as a teenager, a photographer--
in 20's, installation artist--

00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.160
later became a writer--

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.370
so wanted to pursue that path--

00:29:11.370 --> 00:29:14.580
and yet, always
knew that I somehow

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.590
had to figure out the
financial side on my own.

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:20.670
And especially when
my parents divorced,

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:23.670
and within several years
my father remarried--

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:29.070
and married my high
school classmate in fact--

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:33.030
the message was very
clear then that I had to--

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.150
I was very clear that I had
to figure it out on my own--

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.990
financially-- and
so taught myself

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.600
finance, and real
estate, and I was lucky.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.430
My timing was good.

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:46.770
I was living in the Bay Area.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:48.820
The real estate's
done very well there.

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.489
And so I was able to--

00:29:50.489 --> 00:29:51.780
BILL CRAWFORD: Very well, sure.

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:53.850
FRANCES STROH:
--create a nest egg

00:29:53.850 --> 00:29:57.630
that supports me to continue
to be a writer and an artist,

00:29:57.630 --> 00:29:59.277
which has been very lucky.

00:29:59.277 --> 00:30:00.360
BILL CRAWFORD: Very cool--

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.700
and so what-- you mentioned
you've gone through a couple

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:08.730
iterations as an artist,
as the installment artist,

00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:11.630
and a writer.

00:30:11.630 --> 00:30:13.480
What's next for you?

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:15.660
I mean, is writing--

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:16.590
is there more books?

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:16.704
Can we--

00:30:16.704 --> 00:30:16.880
FRANCES STROH: Well I identify--

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.330
BILL CRAWFORD: --expect--

00:30:17.330 --> 00:30:18.490
FRANCES STROH: --as a writer.

00:30:18.490 --> 00:30:18.795
And I was-- so--

00:30:18.795 --> 00:30:18.930
BILL CRAWFORD: OK--

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:19.065
FRANCES STROH: Yes--

00:30:19.065 --> 00:30:19.360
BILL CRAWFORD:
--you identify as--

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:19.420
FRANCES STROH: --I'm--

00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:19.845
BILL CRAWFORD: --a writer.

00:30:19.845 --> 00:30:21.510
FRANCES STROH:
--working on a novel.

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.020
BILL CRAWFORD: Oh really?

00:30:22.020 --> 00:30:22.380
FRANCES STROH: Yes.

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.853
BILL CRAWFORD: Can you divulge--

00:30:23.853 --> 00:30:24.140
FRANCES STROH: I'm not--

00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:24.570
BILL CRAWFORD: --any--

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.250
FRANCES STROH: --saying
a lot about it,

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.370
but it's definitely--
it's early stages.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.590
And it's an exciting project.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.090
BILL CRAWFORD: Very
cool, very cool.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:35.256
So what-- like, what are
we thinking-- like, a year?

00:30:35.256 --> 00:30:37.449
When can we keep
an eye out for it?

00:30:37.449 --> 00:30:39.240
FRANCES STROH: Oh,
probably more than that.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:39.490
BILL CRAWFORD: OK.

00:30:39.490 --> 00:30:41.900
FRANCES STROH: Yes, it
took me about four years

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.110
to write "Beer Money," so--

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.480
BILL CRAWFORD: Really?

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:43.950
All right.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:45.574
FRANCES STROH: Yeah,
I like to do draft

00:30:45.574 --> 00:30:49.770
after draft to really get
the language exactly where I

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.182
want it.

00:30:51.182 --> 00:30:52.390
BILL CRAWFORD: Perfectionist?

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:53.223
FRANCES STROH: I am.

00:30:53.223 --> 00:30:54.810
BILL CRAWFORD: Very good.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:56.490
And you talk about Detroit.

00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.200
Now you've transplanted
yourself to San Francisco.

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:05.850
Any plans to take that
real estate prowess,

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.786
and bring it to the D?

00:31:08.786 --> 00:31:10.410
FRANCES STROH: That's
a great question.

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.630
I've been thinking
about different options.

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:13.567
And I would love to.

00:31:13.567 --> 00:31:14.400
BILL CRAWFORD: Good.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:17.850
FRANCES STROH: It's a great
time to invest in Detroit.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:22.080
And I can't say enough about
all of the exciting things

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.500
happening here.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:26.310
So I actually
encourage the world

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.120
to come experience Detroit
in one way or another.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:34.110
It's just so exciting to see
how the financial base is

00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:38.430
so diverse now compared to
what it was when it was really

00:31:38.430 --> 00:31:41.730
run by the automotive industry.

00:31:41.730 --> 00:31:45.210
And then of course the city
suffered so dramatically when

00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:47.480
they moved out.

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:50.170
And of-- you know, the
industry is still here.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:53.250
But a lot of other industries
are moving in as well,

00:31:53.250 --> 00:31:57.370
like Google, and like so
many other tech companies.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:32:02.879
And so I feel as if it's a more
sustainable economic space.

00:32:02.879 --> 00:32:04.920
BILL CRAWFORD: I would
completely agree with you.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.120
FRANCES STROH:
Which is exciting.

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.350
BILL CRAWFORD: Very exciting.

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:10.504
Yes, well we would
love to have you.

00:32:10.504 --> 00:32:12.420
We'd love to have your
investment in the city,

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.074
but we'd love to see more
of Frances Stroh around--

00:32:15.074 --> 00:32:16.115
FRANCES STROH: Thank you.

00:32:16.115 --> 00:32:16.490
BILL CRAWFORD: --Detroit.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:16.990
Yeah.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:23.232
OK, so final question--

00:32:23.232 --> 00:32:25.440
a lot about the book is
about the business, and about

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.210
the family, and how those
two things intertwined.

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:31.800
Any-- it's certainly--
I read it almost

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:35.400
as a little bit of
a cautionary tale.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.670
Do you see any similarities
between that situation

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:40.590
and, like, the Silicon Valley--

00:32:40.590 --> 00:32:42.509
kind of, these, like,
inflated values,

00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:43.800
and all these different things?

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:48.390
Is there anything we-- as
folks working at Google,

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:52.020
or working at Facebook,
or working at any of the--

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:56.370
LinkedIn, wherever--
any words of advice?

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.660
Anything to be careful of?

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:59.160
FRANCES STROH: Well
I would see more

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.150
of a parallel between Detroit
and the auto industry,

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:08.220
and you know, what
Detroit was at that time,

00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:09.555
to Silicon Valley.

00:33:09.555 --> 00:33:15.915
I see that parallel,
because it's really--

00:33:15.915 --> 00:33:20.370
it's an industry
that defines an area.

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:24.690
In a way that Detroit was
defined by the auto industry,

00:33:24.690 --> 00:33:27.180
Silicon Valley is
defined by tech.

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:29.790
That isn't necessarily
the case in a lot

00:33:29.790 --> 00:33:34.650
of other American cities
or areas of the country.

00:33:34.650 --> 00:33:38.340
The parallel-- I would
find more of a parallel

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:42.180
between my family's business
and other family businesses.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:47.490
But the sense of hubris kind
of crosses all those barriers.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.030
And I feel as if
that is something

00:33:51.030 --> 00:33:54.660
that we all need to be
very, very vigilant about,

00:33:54.660 --> 00:34:01.170
because the bubble mentality
is incredibly contagious.

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:05.670
And we lose perspective
very easily.

00:34:05.670 --> 00:34:07.830
And suddenly,
things have changed.

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:10.860
And we didn't even know
that change was coming.

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:16.739
So appreciating what we have,
and the perseverance that--

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.210
you know, the founder's values--

00:34:18.210 --> 00:34:21.420
I think of Bernhard's values.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.900
If that could be carried
on through each successive

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:27.389
generation somehow--

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.170
I work with, now I consult
with family businesses

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:34.530
about how to get the
younger generation out

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.670
into the world after
college and build some grit,

00:34:38.670 --> 00:34:42.000
and not have their
parents hand them jobs,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.489
or call up their friends to
give them a job for a year

00:34:44.489 --> 00:34:47.504
before they come back and work
at the family business, which

00:34:47.504 --> 00:34:50.460
was how it worked in my family.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:54.719
Send them out with a small
amount of money to get started,

00:34:54.719 --> 00:34:58.690
and make them figure it out
on their own for 10 years.

00:34:58.690 --> 00:35:02.530
It's only when we figure
out who we are in the world,

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:07.640
we follow a passion, or two, or
three, carve out an identity--

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.380
only then might
we have something

00:35:09.380 --> 00:35:12.320
to offer our family's
business, or any other business

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.650
for that matter.

00:35:13.650 --> 00:35:18.859
So that's my advice for families
and everybody else in business.

00:35:18.859 --> 00:35:20.400
BILL CRAWFORD: Thank
you so, so much,

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.280
Frances for coming here from San
Francisco, through Detroit now,

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:28.250
to Ann Arbor to talk with us.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.170
So yeah, we really
appreciate it.

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:30.890
thank you so much for your time.

00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.957
FRANCES STROH: Thank you.

00:35:30.957 --> 00:35:31.620
It's been a pleasure.

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:33.161
BILL CRAWFORD: This
has been amazing.

00:35:33.161 --> 00:35:34.220
Very, very great.
