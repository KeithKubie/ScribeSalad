00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.150
We're asked to identify which
expression is larger.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.570
5 squared plus 3 to the fifth.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.010
Or 3 to the fifth and then
that whole thing squared.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:11.680
So let's just work this out.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.610
So let's do the first
one here, 5 squared

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.860
plus 3 to the fifth.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.890
So what is 5 squared?

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.040
5 squared is the same
thing as 5 times 5,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.040
which is equal to 25.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.100
So that right there is 25.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.090
And what's 3 to the fifth?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.630
Well, 3 to the fifth is equal
to 3 times 3 times 3

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.270
times 3 times 3.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.190
And what's this going to be?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.980
3 times 3 is 9.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.640
9 times 3 is 27.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.500
27 times 3 is 81.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.300
And 81 times 3 is 243.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.940
So this up here is the same
thing as 25, that's what 5

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.790
squared is, plus 243.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:23.480
Which is equal to, we can do
this in our head, 268.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.500
So that's what the first
expression is.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.750
Now let's see what 3 to
the fifth squared is.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.805
Well we already figured out what
3 to the fifth is, 3 to

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:39.730
the fifth is 3 times 3 times
3 times 3 times 3.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:41.500
It's 243.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.900
So this expression right
here is 243.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.170
And we're going to square
that entire thing.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.430
So this is equal
to 243 squared.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.240
Now, they just want to know
which expression is larger.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.890
And we already have a
pretty good sense.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.460
The first expression
is only 268.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.330
The second expression, the
number is a little bit smaller

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.330
than 268, but it's that
number squared.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.250
This is 243 times 243.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.540
Which you might already sense
is going to be a much larger

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.980
number than 268.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.900
So you should at this point
already say, hey this is a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.240
much larger number than that.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.840
We don't know the exact
number yet.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.150
But if they just want to know
which expression is larger,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.810
it's definitely going
to be this one.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.370
And if just out of curiosity
you want to know what that

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.040
number is, we can solve it.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.670
So if we do 243 times 243.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.650
3 times 3 is 9.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.320
3 times 4 is 12.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.300
3 times 2 is 6.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.420
Plus 1 is 7.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.690
Put a zero down here.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.270
4 times 3 is 12.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.265
Let me do this in a
different color so

00:02:54.265 --> 00:02:55.515
we don't get confused.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.640
4 times 4 is 16.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.080
Plus 1 is 17.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.500
Put a 1 here.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.600
4 times 2 is 8.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.820
Plus 1 is 9.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.890
Now let's do this last
row over here.

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:15.950
We have the 2's.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:16.990
Put two 0's here.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.390
2 times 3 is 6.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.630
2 times 4 is 8.

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.000
2 times 2 is 4.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.860
So let's add everything
up and what do we get?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.020
We get just a 9 there,
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.030
7 plus 7 is 14, plus 6 is 20.

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:44.910
2 plus 9 is 11, plus 8 is 19.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.500
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:53.210
So you get 59,049 which is
clearly way bigger than 268.
