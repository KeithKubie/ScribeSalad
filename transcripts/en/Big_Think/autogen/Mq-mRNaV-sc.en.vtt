00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.819
quantum computing is a whole new

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829
quantum computing is a whole new
 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.400
quantum computing is a whole new
category of computing and it directly

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
category of computing and it directly
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.079
category of computing and it directly
leverages the laws of quantum mechanics

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089
leverages the laws of quantum mechanics
 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.780
leverages the laws of quantum mechanics
to do a computation as we all know

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
to do a computation as we all know
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.759
to do a computation as we all know
quantum quantum mechanics are the most

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769
quantum quantum mechanics are the most
 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.320
quantum quantum mechanics are the most
fundamental laws in the universe

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330
fundamental laws in the universe
 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.820
fundamental laws in the universe
it describes how everything in the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
it describes how everything in the
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.420
it describes how everything in the
universe works so what we've built and

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430
universe works so what we've built and
 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.390
universe works so what we've built and
what other quantum computing researchers

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400
what other quantum computing researchers
 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.150
what other quantum computing researchers
have done is create computers that

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160
have done is create computers that
 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.939
have done is create computers that
directly use those laws of quantum

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949
directly use those laws of quantum
 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.400
directly use those laws of quantum
mechanics and that sounds fairly

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410
mechanics and that sounds fairly
 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.380
mechanics and that sounds fairly
straightforward but in fact it's quite

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390
straightforward but in fact it's quite
 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.139
straightforward but in fact it's quite
difficult to do because the enemy of

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
difficult to do because the enemy of
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.569
difficult to do because the enemy of
quantum computing is the environment so

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579
quantum computing is the environment so
 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.430
quantum computing is the environment so
you and when I say the environment I

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
you and when I say the environment I
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.069
you and when I say the environment I
mean things like temperature when you

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
mean things like temperature when you
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.600
mean things like temperature when you
have temperature you have molecules

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610
have temperature you have molecules
 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.970
have temperature you have molecules
moving around that cause interference to

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980
moving around that cause interference to
 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.630
moving around that cause interference to
the quantum computation you also have

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640
the quantum computation you also have
 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.450
the quantum computation you also have
electromagnetic interference from radio

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460
electromagnetic interference from radio
 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760
electromagnetic interference from radio
sources and gamma rays and all sorts of

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770
sources and gamma rays and all sorts of
 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.889
sources and gamma rays and all sorts of
things so you need to create a very

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
things so you need to create a very
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.689
things so you need to create a very
quiet clean cold environment for these

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699
quiet clean cold environment for these
 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.229
quiet clean cold environment for these
these chips to work in and ultimately

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
these chips to work in and ultimately
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.210
these chips to work in and ultimately
what we're building is a quantum

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220
what we're building is a quantum
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.160
what we're building is a quantum
computer on a chip that's about the size

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
computer on a chip that's about the size
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770
computer on a chip that's about the size
of your fingernail in this very exotic

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050
of your fingernail in this very exotic
environment so that that environment

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
environment so that that environment
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.960
environment so that that environment
runs at near absolute zero so absolute

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
runs at near absolute zero so absolute
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.700
runs at near absolute zero so absolute
zero as you know is the lowest

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710
zero as you know is the lowest
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.490
zero as you know is the lowest
temperature possible and in the universe

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500
temperature possible and in the universe
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.399
temperature possible and in the universe
it so-called zero degrees Kelvin so

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409
it so-called zero degrees Kelvin so
 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.440
it so-called zero degrees Kelvin so
these machines run at a very low

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
these machines run at a very low
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.330
these machines run at a very low
temperature to so that they can have

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340
temperature to so that they can have
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.819
temperature to so that they can have
that pristine very quick clean quiet

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829

environment to run in it doesn't disturb

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
environment to run in it doesn't disturb
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.859
environment to run in it doesn't disturb
that quantum computation and in fact it

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869
that quantum computation and in fact it
 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.240
that quantum computation and in fact it
runs down at what's called 10

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
runs down at what's called 10
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.350

millikelvin which is 0.01 Kelvin

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360
millikelvin which is 0.01 Kelvin
 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.420
millikelvin which is 0.01 Kelvin
absolute zero is zero degrees Kelvin so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430
absolute zero is zero degrees Kelvin so
 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.569
absolute zero is zero degrees Kelvin so

because we're also running in a
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.999
because we're also running in a
effectively a magnetic vacuum so you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
effectively a magnetic vacuum so you
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.639
effectively a magnetic vacuum so you
could consider these environments these

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649
could consider these environments these
 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.920

00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:20.589
quantum computer and then there's the
 

00:08:20.589 --> 00:08:22.320
