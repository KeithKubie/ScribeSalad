00:00:00.109 --> 00:00:05.710
So if the name Ivan Pavlov rings a bell, it’s
because his experiments are among the most

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.389
famous in the history of psychology.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.019
His work contributed to the foundation of
the behaviorist school of thought that viewed

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:18.120
psychology as an empirically rigorous science
focused on observable behaviors and not unobservable

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.630
internal mental processes.
Even though today we view psychology as the

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.050
science of both behavior AND mental processes,
Pavlov’s influence was tremendous. His research

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.170
helped pave the path for more experimental
rigor in behavioral research, right up to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.370
the present day.
Born in 1849 in Russia, Pavlov was never much

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.489
for psychology. After giving up on his original
aspirations to become a Russian Orthodox priest

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.600
like his father, he instead earned a medical
degree and spent nearly twenty years studying

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.680
the digestive system, earning Russia’s first
Nobel Prize in his mid-50s for his research

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.210
expanding our understanding of how stomachs
worked.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.540
He didn’t study human stomachs though...cause
the procedures were terrible and cruel...he

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.130
studied dog stomachs.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.650
And while researching those dogs, he noticed
how the animals would salivate at a mere whiff

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:06.650
of their dinner.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.970
At first he found all that slobber annoying,
but soon started to suspect that this behavior

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.500
was actually a simple but important form of
learning.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.950
For us scholars of psychology, we can define
learning as the process of acquiring, through

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.299
experience, new and relatively enduring information
or behaviors.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.700
Whether through association, observation,
or just plain thinking, learning is what allows

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.710
us to adapt to our environments and to survive.
And as Pavlov began to discover, it wasn’t

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.080
only humans who learned.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.869
Soon enough he was turning out his famous
series of experiments, in which he paired

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.659
the presence of meat powder - yummy - which
got the dogs to drooling, with lots of different

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.840
neutral stimuli -- things that wouldn’t
normally make you drool, like a certain sound,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.170
a shining light, or a touch on the leg.
Then Pavlov observed, after several of these

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.351
pairings, a dog would start to drool just
at the sound or the light or the touch, even

00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:59.400
if there wasn’t any slobber-inducing meat
powder around.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.880
Animals, he found, can exhibit associative
learning. That’s when a subject links certain

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.830
events, behaviors, or stimuli together in
the process of conditioning.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.190
This may be the most elemental, basic form
of learning a brain can do. But that doesn’t

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.700
mean that the processes behind conditioning
are, or ever were, obvious. Or, for that matter,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700
simple.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.910
In fact, the research that’s gone into how
we’re conditioned by our environments has

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.680
helped shape the science of psychology, from
a still-kinda-subjective-thought-exercise

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.780
into the more rigorous discipline we know
today.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.580
And it also starred some of psychology’s
most notable, and often controversial, figures,

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.260
including Pavlov, B. F. Skinner -- aaaand
that guy who trained kids to be terrified

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.480
of furry animals...
[INTRO]

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:51.459
OK, I’m not a licensed dog-trainer - do
they license dog trainers? But I can break

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.440
down for you the sequence of steps in Pavlov’s
famous experiment, to help you get a sense

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.370
of how conditioning works:
First, before conditioning, the dog just drools

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.459
when it smells food. That smell is the unconditioned
stimulus, and the slobbering, the unconditioned,

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.260
or natural response. The ringing sound, which
at this point means nothing to the dog, is

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.180
the neutral stimulus, and it produces no drooling.
During conditioning, the unconditioned stimulus

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.410
-- that food smell -- is paired with the neutral
stimulus -- the bell sound -- and results

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.099
in drooling. This is repeated many times until
the association between the two stimuli is

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.239
made, in a stage called acquisition.
By the time you get to the after-conditioning

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.750
phase, that old neutral stimulus has become
a conditioned stimulus, because it now elicits

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.920
the conditioned response of drooling.
Sounds super simple, right? If you have a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.019
dog, you’ve probably seen it tapdance at
the sight of a leash, but in Pavlov’s day,

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.000
this whole series of steps hadn’t really
been studied in a lab setting, or thought

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.700
about in scientific terms.
Pavlov’s work suggested that classical conditioning

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.940
-- as this kind of learning came to be known
-- could be an adaptive form of learning that

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.010
helps an animal survive by changing its behavior
to better suit its environment. In this case,

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.450
a bell means food, and food means survival.
So get ready!

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:07.170
Not only that, but methodologically, classical
conditioning shows how a process like learning

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.330
can actually be studied through direct observation
of behavior, in real time, without all those

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:15.670
messy feelings and emotions.
This was something Pavlov especially appreciated

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:21.329
given his disdain for “mentalistic” concepts
like consciousness and introspection championed

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.159
by Freud.
Behaviorist psychologists, like Pavlov’s

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:28.930
younger American analogues B.F. Skinner and
John B. Watson, also embraced the notion that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.310
psychology was all about objective, observable
behavior.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.020
In his 1930 book Behaviorism, he argued that
given a dozen healthy infants he could train

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.659
any one of them to be a doctor, artist, lawyer,
or even a thief, regardless of their talents,

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:43.139
tendencies, or ancestry.

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.369
Whoa there, Watson! Thankfully no one gave
him any infants.

00:04:46.369 --> 00:04:51.129
In his most famous and, yes, controversial
experiment, Watson conditioned a young child,

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.621
dubbed “Little Albert,” to fear a white
rat. Maybe that doesn’t sound so bad, but

00:04:55.621 --> 00:05:01.060
he accomplished this by pairing the rat with
a loud, scary noise, over and over and then

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.940
demonstrated that the child’s terror could
branch out and be generalized to include other

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.029
furry, white objects… like bunnies, dogs,
or even fur coats.

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:13.830
So yeah, that’d never fly today, obviously,
but Watson’s research did make other psychologists

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.009
wonder whether adults, too, were just holding
tanks of conditioned emotions -- and if so,

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.059
whether new conditioning could be used to
undo old conditioning. Like, if you’re terrified

00:05:24.059 --> 00:05:27.960
of roller coasters, but you made yourself
ride one ten times a day for two weeks, would

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.909
your fears fade?
For the record, recent exploration has revealed

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:35.520
that the boy known at Little Albert sadly
died a few years after these experiments,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.009
while Watson eventually left academia and
got into advertising, where he put all that

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.360
associative learning to lucrative use.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.270
So that’s classical conditioning. But we’ve
also got another kind of associative learning:

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.779
operant conditioning.
If classical conditioning is all about forming

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:55.539
associations between stimuli, operant conditioning
involves associating our own behavior with

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:59.710
consequences. The kid who gets a cookie for
saying please, or the aquarium seal that gets

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.860
a sardine for balancing a ball on its nose,
they’ve both been trained with operant conditioning.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:09.349
The basic premise here is that behaviors increase
when followed by a reinforcement, or reward,

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:13.449
but they decrease when followed by a punishment.
And the most well-known champion of operant

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:18.910
conditioning is American behaviorist B.F.
Skinner. He designed the famous operant chamber,

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:23.619
or “Skinner Box”--a confined space containing
a lever or button that an animal could touch

00:06:23.619 --> 00:06:28.479
to get some sort of reward, typically food,
along with a device that keeps track of its

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.930
responses.
Okay, time for a debunking break!

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.749
Other than maybe Freud, no other figure in
psychology seems to be as shrouded in lore

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:40.680
and misinformation as B. F. Skinner. So I’m
just going to tell you straight that, no,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.280
Skinner never put any kids in this box. And
no, he didn’t raise his children without

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.229
love or affection, and his daughter didn’t
hate his guts until the day she committed

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.750
suicide. Deborah Skinner is alive and well,
and she loved her dad plenty.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.190
Skinner DID, however, invent something called
an air crib--a climate controlled box with

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.199
a window on the front that was meant to keep
babies warm and safe while moms ran around

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:08.339
doing their 1950’s-lady thang. It’s not
exactly where I’d like to spend the night,

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:11.050
but it wasn’t remotely the same as the Skinner
Box.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:14.979
No one knows where all of these myths came
from, but being a somewhat controversial guy,

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.909
Skinner had a lot of haters, some of whom
were probably happy to perpetuate misinformation.

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:23.680
But back to the rat in the box. Basically,
the box provided an observable stage to demonstrate

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:28.139
Skinner’s concept of reinforcement, which
is anything that increases the behavior that

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.529
it follows. In other words, you push the lever,
you get a snack, and then you want to keep

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.680
pushing the lever.
But most rats aren’t going to push a lever

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.050
for no reason. I mean, there aren’t food-dispensing
levers in a natural environment, so operant-conditioning

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.020
behavior requires shaping.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.349
Maybe you give the rat a nibble of food each
time it gets closer to the bar, then only

00:07:46.349 --> 00:07:50.699
when it touches the bar, until little by little,
in a series of successive approximations to

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:54.599
the desired behavior, you only reward them
only when they do what you’re trying to

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.729
shape them to do.
In everyday life, we’re all continually

00:07:57.729 --> 00:08:02.659
reinforcing, shaping, and refining each other’s
behaviors, both intentionally and accidentally.

00:08:02.659 --> 00:08:06.119
We do this with both positive and negative
reinforcement.

00:08:06.119 --> 00:08:11.189
Positive reinforcement obviously strengthens
responses by giving rewards after a desired

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:15.879
event, like the rat snack after a lever push,
or getting a cookie when you say please.

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:19.589
Negative reinforcement is a little trickier.
It’s what increases a behavior by taking

00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:24.559
away an aversive or upsetting stimulus. Like,
say, you get in your car and it does that

00:08:24.559 --> 00:08:29.459
infernal beeping thing until you fasten your
seatbelt. The car is reinforcing your seatbelt-wearing

00:08:29.459 --> 00:08:33.919
by getting rid of that horrible beeping. And
it’s good, because you should wear your

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:35.509
seatbelt.
It’s important to recognize here that negative

00:08:35.509 --> 00:08:38.659
reinforcement is NOT the same as punishment.

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:43.919
Punishment decreases a behavior either positively,
by say, giving a speeding ticket, or negatively,

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:48.029
by taking away a driver’s license.
But negative reinforcement removes the punishing

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:53.250
event to increase a behavior. So, painkillers
negatively reinforce the behavior of swallowing

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.079
them by ending the headache.

00:08:55.079 --> 00:08:58.519
So by now hopefully you’re getting the picture.
There are things that we want and things that

00:08:58.519 --> 00:09:03.120
we don’t want, and we can be taught by way
of those impulses to behave certain ways.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.370
But it’s worth pointing out that conditioning
is way more complex than just the cookie and

00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:10.459
the beeping car.
For one thing ending annoyance or getting

00:09:10.459 --> 00:09:15.690
a cookie, are types of primary reinforcers--you
don’t have to learn that, they just make

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:19.370
innate biological sense. Beeping is annoying,
cookies are delicious.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.569
But there are other kinds of reinforcers that
we only recognize after we learn to associate

00:09:23.569 --> 00:09:29.019
them with primary reinforcers. Like, a paycheck
is a conditioned reinforcer--we want money

00:09:29.019 --> 00:09:32.730
because we need food and shelter, which are
still the primary drivers.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:37.500
Plus, just as there are different kinds of
reinforcers, so are there various reinforcement

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.850
schedules. Like, those boxed rats were getting
continuous reinforcement when they got a treat

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:45.420
every single time they hit that lever, so
they picked it up pretty quickly.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:49.310
But if one day the rat chow doesn’t come,
that connection quickly dwindles, and the

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:53.040
rat stops hitting the lever. This is a process
called extinction.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:58.160
And it is important, because that’s how
real life works. Outside of a Skinner box,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.149
you’re not gonna get continuous reinforcement.
All of life is a series of partial, or intermittent

00:10:03.149 --> 00:10:08.139
reinforcements, that occur only sometimes.
Learning under these conditions takes longer,

00:10:08.139 --> 00:10:11.819
but it holds up better in the long run and
is less susceptible to that extinction.

00:10:11.819 --> 00:10:16.089
So, say a cafe gives out a free cup of coffee
for every ten you buy, while another shop

00:10:16.089 --> 00:10:20.779
pours a free double shots every Tuesday morning,
and yet another has a free-coffee lottery

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:25.279
that customers win at random. These are all
different kinds of intermittent reinforcement

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:28.019
techniques that get customers coming back
for more.

00:10:28.019 --> 00:10:32.709
Now, Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner’s ideas
were definitely controversial -- as well as

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:36.279
the whole scary-rat experiments. Plenty of
folks disagreed with their insistence that

00:10:36.279 --> 00:10:40.829
only external influences, and not internal
thoughts and feelings, shaped behavior.

00:10:40.829 --> 00:10:45.540
It was clear to many of the behaviorists’
rivals that our cognitive processes - our

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.480
thoughts, perceptions, feelings, memories
- also influence the way we learn.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.750
We’re going talk about how these other things
factor into learning next week when we look

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:59.029
more at conditioning, cognition and observational
learning -- and yeah, also watch kids beat

00:10:59.029 --> 00:11:03.100
the face iff blow-up dolls.
Today you learned about how associative learning

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.939
works, the essentials of behaviorist theory,
the basic components of classical and operant

00:11:07.939 --> 00:11:13.389
conditioning, including positive and negative
reinforcement, and reinforcement scheduling.
