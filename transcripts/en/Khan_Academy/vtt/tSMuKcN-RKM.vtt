00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.420
A rectangular storage
container with an open top

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.790
needs to have a volume
of 10 cubic meters.

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.290
The length of its base
is twice the width.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.840
Material for the base
costs $10 per square meter.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.950
Material for the sides
costs $6 per square meter.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.440
Find the cost of the material
for the cheapest container.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.570
So let's draw this
open storage container,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.040
this open rectangular
storage container.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.720
So it's going to
have an open top.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.190
So let me draw its open
top as good as I can.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.250
So it's going to
have an open top.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.310
That's the top of my container.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.945
And then let me draw the sides.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.330
Just like that.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.780
So it might look
something like that.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.960
And then I could draw--
and since it's open top,

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.890
I can see through, I could see
the inside of the container

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:54.410
as well.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.774
So the container would
look something like that.

00:00:59.774 --> 00:01:00.940
And so what do they tell us?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.935
They tell us that the volume
needs to be 10 cubic meters.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:05.110
So let me write that down.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.360
The volume needs to be
equal to 10 meters cubed.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.040
The length of its base
is twice the width.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.090
So the length, let's
call the width x,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.910
so the length is going
to be twice that.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.350
It's going to be 2x.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.320
That's what they tell
us right over here.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.110
They tell us the
material for the base

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.490
costs $10 per square meter.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.530
So this area right
over here-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.560
if I was transparent I could
continue to draw it down here.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.010
But this right over
here, that material

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.150
costs $10 per square meter.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.324
Let me label that
$10 per square meter.

00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:46.990
And then they say
material for the sides

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.830
costs $6 per square meter.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.680
So the material over here
costs $6 per meter squared.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.310
So let's see if we can
come up with a value

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.550
or how much this box would cost
to make as a function of x.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.661
But x only gives us the
dimensions of the base.

00:02:10.661 --> 00:02:12.160
We also need a
dimension for height.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.320
So it'll be a function
of x and height for now.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.790
So let's write h as the
height right over here.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.410
So what is the cost of
this container going to be?

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.090
So the cost is going to be
equal to the cost of the base.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.750
Well, the cost of the base
is going to be $10 times--

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.290
I'll just write 10.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.634
This is going to be 10
times the area of the base.

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.050
Well, what's the
area of the base?

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.133
Well, it's going to be the
width times the length.

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:44.380
So 10 times x times 2x.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.285
That is the cost of base.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.872
And now what's going to
be the cost of the sides?

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.330
Well, the different
sides are going

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.690
to have different dimensions.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.040
You have this side
over here and this side

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.750
over here, which have
the same dimension.

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.370
They both have an
area of x times h.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.110
You have x times h.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.490
And then our material
is $6 per square meter.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.670
So it's 6 times x times h
would be the cost of one

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.540
of these side panels.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.920
So for two of them we
have to multiply by 2.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.080
So plus 2 times 6 times h.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.890
And then we have
these two side panels.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.070
We have this side
panel right over here

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.340
and we have this side
panel right over here.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.760
The area of each of them
is going to be 2x times h.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.380
So it's going to be 2x times h.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.970
The cost of the material
is going to be 6.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.430
So the cost of one
of the panels is

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.320
going to be $6 per square
meters times 2xh meters squared.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.760
But we have two of these panels.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.060
One panel and two panels.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:55.390
So we have to multiply by 2.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.120
And so we will get-- so
this is right over here,

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.410
this is the cost of the sides.

00:04:03.652 --> 00:04:05.360
And so let's see if
we can simplify this.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.640
And I'll write it all
in a neutral color.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.360
So this is going
to be equal to 10.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.860
Let's see.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.690
10 times 2 is 20.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.660
x times x is x squared.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.620
And then you have
2 times 6 times xh.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.206
So this is going
to be plus 12xh.

00:04:22.206 --> 00:04:24.080
And then this is going
to be 2 times 6, which

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.560
is 12 times 2 is 24xh plus 24xh.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:39.730
So this is going to be equal
to 20x squared plus 36xh.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.339
So this is going to be my cost.

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:42.880
But I'm not ready
to optimize it yet.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.000
We don't know how to optimize
with respect to two variables.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.416
We only know how to optimize
with respect to one variable,

00:04:47.416 --> 00:04:50.460
and maybe I'll say let's
optimize with respect to x.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.730
But if we want to optimize
with respect to x,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.360
we have to express h
as a function of x.

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.650
So how can we do that?

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.030
How can we express h
as a function of x?

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:05.310
Well, we know that the volume
has to be 10 cubic meters.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:13.300
So we know that x, the width
times the length times 2x times

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.010
the height times h
needs to be equal to 10.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:19.880
Or another way of saying
that, this tells us

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.210
that 2x squared h,
2x squared times h

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.700
needs to be equal to 10.

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.430
And so if we want h
as a function of x,

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:30.290
we just divide both
sides by 2x squared.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:37.720
And we get h is equal
to 10 over 2x squared.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:44.550
Or we could say that h is
equal to 5 over x squared.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.430
And then we can substitute
back right over here.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.930
h is equal to 5 over x squared.

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.290
So all of this business is
going to be equal to 20 times

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:00.950
x squared plus 36 times
x times 5 over x squared.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:12.810
So our cost as a function
of x is going to be 20x

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.000
squared 36 times 5.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.130
Let's see, 30
times 5 is 150 plus

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.340
another 30 is going to be 180.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.170
So it's going to be plus
180 times, let's see,

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:27.730
x times x to the negative
2, 180x to the negative x

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.150
to the negative 1 power.

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.340
So we finally have cost
as a function of x.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.700
Now we're ready to optimize.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.650
To optimize, we just
have to figure out

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.784
what are the
critical points here

00:06:38.784 --> 00:06:40.325
and whether those
critical points are

00:06:40.325 --> 00:06:42.490
a minimum or a maximum value.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.972
So let's see what we can do.

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:47.430
So to find a critical point,
we take the derivative, figure

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.357
out where the derivative
is undefined or equal to 0,

00:06:50.357 --> 00:06:52.190
and those are our
candidate critical points.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.060
And then from the
critical points

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.040
we find, they might be
minimum or maximum values.

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.980
So the derivative of c of
our cost with respect to x

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:09.310
is going to be equal to 40
times x minus 180 times x

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:11.450
to the negative 2 power.

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:16.730
Now, this seems-- well
it's defined for all x

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.910
except for x equaling 0.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.157
But x equaling 0 is
not interesting to us

00:07:21.157 --> 00:07:22.740
as a critical point
because then we're

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.864
going to have a degenerate.

00:07:23.864 --> 00:07:25.454
This is going to
have no base at all.

00:07:25.454 --> 00:07:27.620
So we don't want to worry
about that critical point.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.009
We would have no volume at
all, so it would not work out.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:31.800
And actually, if x
equals 0 then our height

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.260
is undefined as well.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.780
So this was defined
for everything else,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:39.410
for anything other
than x equals 0.

00:07:39.410 --> 00:07:41.520
So let's see when
this derivative is

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:46.590
equal to 0 in our search for
our potential critical points.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:48.900
So when does-- I'll
do it over here.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:57.760
When does 40x minus 180x
to the negative 2 equal 0?

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.530
Well, we could add the 180x to
the negative 2 to both sides.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.310
We get 40x is equal to 180.

00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:10.010
And I could write it
as 180 over x squared.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.740
Now let's see.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.940
We could multiply both sides
of this equation by x squared

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:21.430
and we would get 40x to
the third is equal to 180.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.680
Divide both sides by 40.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:29.040
You get x to the third
is equal to 180 over 40,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.400
which is the same
thing as 18 over 4,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.350
which is the same
thing as 9 over 2.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.980
And so if we want
to solve for x,

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.730
we get that x is equal
to a critical point.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:47.370
We get a critical point of x is
equal to 9/2 to the 1/3 power,

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.689
the cube root of 9/2.

00:08:48.689 --> 00:08:49.230
So let's see.

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:52.600
Let's get an approximate
value for what that is.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:58.150
So if we take 9/2,
9 divided by 2--

00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:59.820
I guess you could
call that 4.5--

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.670
and we want to raise
it to the 1/3 power.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:06.860
To the 1/3 power we get 1.65.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:12.925
So it's approximately equal
to 1.65 as our critical point.

00:09:12.925 --> 00:09:14.300
Now the way the
problem is asked,

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.280
we're only getting one
legitimate critical point here.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.840
So that's probably going
to be the x at which we

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.000
achieve a minimum value.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.930
But let's use our second
derivative test just in case

00:09:25.930 --> 00:09:27.500
to make sure that
we're definitely

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.830
concave upwards over here,
in which case, this will

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.160
definitely be the
x value at which we

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.960
achieve a minimum value.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.615
So the second derivative.

00:09:35.615 --> 00:09:36.740
I'll do it right over here.

00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:39.060
The second derivative
of our cost function

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.850
is just the derivative
of this, which

00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:49.770
is going to be equal to 40 minus
180 times negative 2, which

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.660
is negative 360.

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:58.960
So it's going to be plus
360 over x to the 1/3.

00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.970
The derivative of this is
negative 2 times negative 180,

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.460
which is positive 360x to
the negative 3 power, which

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:06.630
is exactly this right over here.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.200
So when x is equal to 1.65,
this is going to be positive.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.740
This is going to be positive.

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:15.620
So let me write this down.
c prime prime of 1.65

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:18.050
is definitely greater than 0.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:22.320
So we're definitely concave
upwards when x is 1.65.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.500
Concave upwards, which
means that our graph is

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.260
going to look
something like this.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.680
And so where the
derivative equal

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:32.540
to 0, which is right over there,
we are at a minimum point.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.424
We are minimizing our cost.

00:10:35.424 --> 00:10:37.590
And so if we go back to the
question, the only thing

00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.750
that we have to do now--
We know the x value

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:41.040
that minimizes our cost.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.070
We now have to find the cost of
the material for the cheapest

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:44.920
container.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.456
So we just have to figure
out what our cost is.

00:10:48.456 --> 00:10:49.830
And we already
know what our cost

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:51.460
is as a function
of x, so we just

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:55.240
have to put 1.65
into this equation.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.270
Evaluate the function at 1.65.

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.690
So let's do that.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:05.520
Our cost is going to be
equal to 20 times 1.65.

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.020
I should say
approximately equal to,

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:08.436
because I'm using
an approximation

00:11:08.436 --> 00:11:09.860
of this original value.

00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:18.870
1.65 squared plus 180.

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:20.681
I could say divided by 1.65.

00:11:20.681 --> 00:11:22.180
That's the same
thing as multiplying

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.140
by 1.65 to the negative 1.

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:33.520
So divided by 1.65,
which is equal to 163.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:37.370
I'll just say $163.5.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.670
So it's approximately.

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.100
So the cost-- let me
do this in a new color.

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.420
We deserve a drum roll now.

00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:57.770
The cost when x is 1.65 is
approximately equal to $163.54.

00:11:57.770 --> 00:12:05.300
So $163.54, which is
quite an expensive box.

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.610
So this is kind of expensive.

00:12:07.610 --> 00:12:10.370
This is fairly
expensive material here.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.820
Although it's a
fairly large box.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:16.410
1.65 meters in
width, and it's going

00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.110
to be twice that in length.

00:12:18.110 --> 00:12:20.830
And then you could figure out
what its height is going to be.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.620
Although it's not
going to be too tall.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.567
5 divided by 1.65 squared.

00:12:24.567 --> 00:12:27.150
I don't know, it'll be roughly
a little under two meters tall.

00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:30.485
So it actually is quite
a large box made out

00:12:30.485 --> 00:12:32.310
of quite expensive material.

00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:37.240
The minimum cost to make this
box is going to be $163.54.
