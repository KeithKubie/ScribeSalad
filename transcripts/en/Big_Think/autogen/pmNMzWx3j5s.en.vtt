00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:53.410 align:start position:0%
you've got to build the architecture as

that's sold I think about cell phone so
 

00:11:59.829 --> 00:12:01.529 align:start position:0%
that's sold I think about cell phone so

00:12:10.349 --> 00:12:10.359 align:start position:0%
used 34 years ago in the market because
 

00:12:10.359 --> 00:12:12.029 align:start position:0%
used 34 years ago in the market because
that's<00:12:10.749><c> not</c><00:12:10.959><c> what</c><00:12:11.019><c> people</c><00:12:11.289><c> want</c><00:12:11.559><c> to</c><00:12:11.649><c> buy</c><00:12:11.769><c> today</c>
