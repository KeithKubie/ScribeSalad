00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Sometimes it's useful to have a number which has lots of factors.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.760
Like the number 12 which can be divided by 2 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 12 itself.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.360
We find these things useful sometimes.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.860
The ancient Greek philosopher Plato

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:23.460
He thought the best choice for something like this was the number 5040.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.420
He thought this was the best choice because it had loads of divisors, lots of factors.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.980
So, 1 divides into it obviously.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.340
2 divides,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.720
3, 4, 5, 6, 7 divides, 8 divides, 9 divides, 10 divides

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.080
So all the numbers up to 10 divide,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.700
12 divides into it as well,

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.600
And it's got 60 divisors all together.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.060
So Plato was thinking this is the best number you could have for, like say, a city.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.300
If the population of a city was 5040 you could divide that up into all kind of different groups.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.180
If you wanted to divide up the land

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.600
Then you'd divide it up into units of 5040.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.400
5040, lots of divisors, plus it has more divisors

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.040
then all the numbers less than 5040.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.280
We now call this a Highly Composite Number.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.980
[Brady Haran] It's like an Antiprime

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.400
[James Grime] It's like, yeah, it's like an Antiprime

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.580
it's the most divisible number, lots of divisors

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.780
In fact the first guy who really properly studied this

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.200
was the famous indian mathematician Ramanujan

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.040
did it about 100 years ago

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.040
Let's take a look at properties of Highly Composite Numbers.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.740
Antiprime Numbers

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.940
(laughs) I don't think it's gonna catch on Brady, I think you are 100 years too late for that!

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.060
So the definition of a Highly Composite Number

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.540
is one that has more divisors,

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.940
factors if you wanna call it factors,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.520
more divisors than any number smaller than it

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.560
let's just run through the numbers, let's find some

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.640
so these are like the previous title holders

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.840
yeah, exactly!

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.220
How many divisors for 1, it's just one.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.270
So, 2, it's a prime, so like primes do, the
only things that divide primes are 1 and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.800
itself it has two divisors, primes have
two divisors

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.640
so 3 would be the same, it has two divisors

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.500
4, now 4 is gonna be different

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.130
it can divide by 1, 2 and 4 so it has
three divisors, and hey!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.760
This has more divisors than the others before it

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.780
so now this is the current winner

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.320
This is the highly composite number so far.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.620
Let's see what 5 does, well 5 is a prime

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.780
so 5 loses

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.800
all right, way down there, 2.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.160
So 4 is still the title holder?

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.500
Yeah, 4 is still winning,

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.260
but then 6 comes along

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.880
oh dear, 6, it can be divided by 1, 2, 3 and 6.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.640
Four divisors, and now 6 is ahead of the game.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.590
We keep going, oh 7, ah no
7 is no good, is a prime it has two divisors

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:14.400
8, does 8 do any better? So we can
divide by 1, 2, 4 and 8

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.340
is has four divisors

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.730
and it's not better than 6 then

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.080
so four divisors, no it hasn't won
anything, and 9 has three divisors so

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.880
it's 1, 3 and 9

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.120
10 has four divisors

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.980
11, prime, two divisors.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.180
12 has six divisors, cause, I told you

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.350
12 is one of these numbers that have lots of
things that divide into it

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.250
1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12. So that has six divisors,

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.250
12 is really good, really up there

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.360
and then so on.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.360
So then yeah, well let's have a look at the title holders there, ok

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.520
highly composite numbers

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.050
let's write out the sequence

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.580
1, you're correct, 1 is there

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.140
2 is there

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.180
4, 6, 12

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.380
and if we carry on, 24, 36, 48, 60

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.660
60 is a good number, that's why we have 60 minutes in an hour,
60 seconds...

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.800
120, 180, 240

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.760
360's there like degrees in a
circle

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.130
lots of things divide into 360, it's a good number to do

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.430
720 and 840 and so on. right

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.990
and they carry on like that.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.860
So these are, this is our sequence of highly composite numbers

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.460
There's is a very important
theorem in maths

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.320
called the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.820
if you want its fancy name.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.440
It means all
positive whole numbers can be written as

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.070
a product of primes by multiplying
prime numbers together

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.270
this is why primes are important, they're our building blocks for other numbers

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.720
they're our atoms for other numbers

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.280
So all
other numbers can be written like this

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.340
if you had a number you'd have primes,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.280
let's just call them just call them prime 1 to a power,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.480
prime 2 to some power, prime 3 to
some power,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:13.800
and that would go on and then and you would end at some point you have
the last prime here prime K to some

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.570
power

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:19.280
let's do an example so if you had the
number 30 it's built up from primes it's

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:29.270
2 times 3 times 5. Primes that divide 30
has to be either 2 3 or 5. 7 doesn't

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.020
divide

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:37.700
yeah so if i had if i do another example
had 550 it be 2 times 5 squared times 11

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.640
up three doesn't divide into it, seven
doesn't divide into it

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.810
19 cannot divide into this number

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.730
I know if you want to do you want to
have a factors you just use that idea

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:50.930
repeatedly

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:56.810
so the factors are the primes that
divide into it repeatedly so I could

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:05.990
divide this by 25, 'cause I can divide by 5 and 5 again or
if I want to divide by 10,  I can divide it by 2 and then divide by 5.

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:11.630
So the factors are just all the possible
combinations or permutations of these

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.810
prime atoms that you've been given to
work with

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.590
They would all look like this all the
factors would look like this would be

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.990
the same primes to be a P1 and P2

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:29.960
P3 to Pk you would have powers here, let's call them B1 and B2 and B3

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.600
Just these powers would be 0 or 1
or 2 or 3 or up to and including

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.970
the final thing

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.240
So anything less than what I've called a
pair

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.300
Now those are your factors so how many factors are there just to show you how

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.110
many factors that are then the factors
of a number of, let's call it n, are the

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.240
divisors of n is a well how many
choices do I get for these powers and

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.990
it's this

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.140
it could be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, anything

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:05.640
look to A1 so it be at A1 plus 1 multiplied by how many choices for the second prime power

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:13.890
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, anything up to A2 that's 1
plus A2 choices

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.750
You just do the same thing for each of
these prime powers so that would go up

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:24.120
to the last one which is Ak plus 1 and
that's how many divisorss the I'll do an

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.530
example of these shall I

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:30.390
So if I do like 30 and look for the divisors
of 30 I can use this here formula

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.340
look called the powers are just one

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.870
How many choices would I have for each of
these powers there's two choices there two

00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:38.280
for that one two for that one

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:45.180
So all the powers are one and this is going
to be 2 times 2 times 2 which is 8

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:52.140
and there are 8 divisors of 30 and if I
did it for 550 slightly different 'cause I've

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:57.930
got this square in it so many choices
here for the first prime power it is 2

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.700
and so I would have 12 factors of 550

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:08.400
so we've seen how to work out divisors
and we should just check 5040 mentally

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.440
great 5040 let's see how many devices
that has if you break it down into

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.740
primes then it's going to look like this

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:28.200
It's 2 to the power 4 multiplied by 3 squared multiplied by 5 multiplied by 7
and so let's look at  the divisor formula

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:33.750
so we want divisors of 5040 and we can
use the powers to help us work out

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:42.120
So it's just gonna be 5 by 3 by 2 by 2 and
that's going to be 60 so there are 60

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.960
devices are 5040 which is greater than
the number smaller and 5040 that makes

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.950
it highly composite a hundred years ago
Ramanujan's those studying these and

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:58.020
notice three properties that highly
composite numbers have to have which

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:02.130
I'll show you now and the not too
difficult to understand but the first

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:06.720
property is the primes of the
factorization of our highly composite

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.870
number have to be consecutive primes

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:14.490
I mean look that's what happened here
you've got 5040 at the where they were

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:20.310
consecutive primes they were 2, 3, 5, and 7 if you look at 550 just

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:24.480
to compare it to something that doesn't
work and that wasn't consecutive primes

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.720
and that was 2 by 5 squared by 11

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.900
now I know that this is not a highly
composite number because I could replace

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:40.770
this 11 for one of the missing
primes

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.940
I could replace it for 7 and it
would be a smaller number but with the

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:48.870
same number of divisors same number of
factors so it's not going to be highly

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.940
composite or the best choice would be if
I picked a number which had consecutive

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.110
primes

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:59.070
so if I picked i'm going to use the same
powers they like they are there so I'm

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:03.690
going to use this 2 by 3 squared by
5

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:08.250
yeah that's better that has consecutive
primes it's a lot smaller number is 90

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:14.580
and 90 we can see has the same number of
devices than 550

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.150
so this is much better choice than 550
so it failed

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:23.070
so yes if you've got a highly composite
number of primes are consecutive that's the

00:10:23.070 --> 00:10:24.150
that's kinda nice

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:31.110
the second thing Ramanujan noticed is the
powers in their prime factorization they

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:35.550
have to be weakly decreasing they have
to be going down like this

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.980
so you can see it here in 540
look 4, 2, 1, and 1

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:45.209
so they're going weakly down so they're
not increasing but it didn't

00:10:45.209 --> 00:10:49.829
happen here with my 550 didn't happen
here with my 90 either

00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:53.220
I tell you why because I can make a
better choice

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:58.889
if I swapped the powers around and if i
put them in a decreasing order it would

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:00.300
look like this

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:08.369
I can have a 2 squared multiplied by 3 multiplied by 5 so it's the
same powers but in a decreasing order

00:11:08.369 --> 00:11:12.059
that makes the number smaller as to why
is that a 60

00:11:12.629 --> 00:11:18.179
so now you've got 60 there has the same
number of divisors and hey this is the

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:23.910
most better choice than 19 in fact 60
there's a highly composite number at the

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:24.660
third thing

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:31.019
Ramanujan noticed was these highly
composite numbers all end with a with

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:38.069
with 1 as the last power so they always end
up with a single prime there at the end

00:11:38.069 --> 00:11:41.610
and so it doesn't end with a square and
then there's actually a couple of

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.519
exceptions for that there are two
exceptions

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:49.559
these are highly composite numbers that
break that rule 4 is a highly

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.519
composite number

00:11:50.519 --> 00:11:58.889
and that's 2 squared and the other number is
a 36 which is a 2 squared by 3 squared

00:11:58.889 --> 00:12:03.360
what Ramanujan showed is that highly
composite numbers have to end with a

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:10.769
prime that has a power one or two and
two has these two exceptions there and

00:12:10.769 --> 00:12:15.119
everything else they all end with one
with their prime power at the end

00:12:16.139 --> 00:12:20.009
oh that's less obvious less obvious than
hear the facts i showed you i took some

00:12:20.009 --> 00:12:25.649
while to prove but it's another
necessary condition for a highly

00:12:25.649 --> 00:12:27.750
composite number

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:32.190
[Brady Haran] In addition to our usual supporters we'd
like to thank audible.com for supporting

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.690
this video if you have to cover a few
miles in planes or trains or automobiles

00:12:36.690 --> 00:12:41.370
one of the best ways to pass the time is
listening to audiobooks

00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:44.940
so while you watch me driving here from
Bristol to Nottingham let me tell you

and I'm going to suggest airframe by
michael crichton it deals with the topic

00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:02.730
i always find fascinating that is air
crash investigations

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:06.330
maybe not want to listen to on a plane
if you're a nervous flyer but definitely

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:07.290
worth your time
