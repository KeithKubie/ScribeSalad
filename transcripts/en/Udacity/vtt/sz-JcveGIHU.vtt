Now before we explore touch support in detail, it's

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.910
imprtant to dunderstand that you may not even need to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.830
do anything in order to support touch. Touch evenets emulate

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.960
mosue clicks already, and the web broswer builds in some

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.710
estures like scrolling and zooming. So, you only need to

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.210
implement somehtin here in cases where the gesture support Or

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.390
mouse emulation does not give an optimal user experience. In

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.760
fact, for most of our conference app we don't use

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.500
touch or pointer events at all. The built

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.790
in mouse emulation works great for clicking on

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.250
items and it's only buried inside the session

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.850
schedule and the map that touch is handled directly.
