00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:10.130
When my phone dies, I like to be tactful;
I prefer to say that it “passed away”.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.120
Hey there power hungry people, I’m Jules
here for DNews.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.600
Smartphone batteries suck.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.720
Actually, all commercial batteries suck, and
that’s kind of a big problem.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.560
Every new smartphone iteration seems to have
twice the megapixels, three times the storage

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.460
space, no headphone jack, and… barely better
battery life.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.739
And that battery life isn’t even guaranteed.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:34.360
On an average smartphone, the lithium-ion
battery is generally expected to last between

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.640
300 and 500 charge cycles, and many of us
do go through an entire charge cycle every

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.860
single day.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.190
So the fact is, smartphone batteries aren’t
really meant to stay fully functional for

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.519
more than a year.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.969
The problem comes from the fact that since
the late 1970s, there hasn’t really been

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.570
a revolutionary commercial breakthrough in
battery technology.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.120
Nearly all rechargeable modern batteries work
by creating electrical current from the movement

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.999
of lithium ions between electrodes, and for
this purpose, lithium is amazing.

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.950
It’s the least dense metal and has the highest
energy-to-weight ratio of comparable metals.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.659
So when we made the shift from chunks of lead
floating in acid to slick smooth lithium as

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.920
a source of storable energy, batteries became
portable and lightweight.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.299
It was an amazing breakthrough and changed
consumer electronics irrevocably… but that

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.040
was 30 years ago.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.630
Today, we still use those same batteries.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.229
But that’s not to say that battery life
isn’t getting better, sometimes in unexpected

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.229
ways.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.490
Just this year, the iPhone 7 Plus came out
with about an hour more battery life than

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.530
the iPhone 6S Plus.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.079
But the battery capacity is only a tiny bit
larger.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.650
The trick is that what we consider “battery
life” is actually capacity, divided by consumption,

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.530
and while capacity is stagnant, power consumption
is not.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.590
The new iPhone processor chip uses only two-thirds
as much power as the previous iteration, while

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.630
reportedly increasing performance by 40%.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.799
Basically, the less power your phone uses,
the better its battery life, without making

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.830
any substantial changes to the battery itself.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.510
Every year, computers and smartphones are
able to do more with less.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.060
But that doesn’t quite solve the bigger
problem: batteries wear out and become useless

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.060
pretty quickly.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.140
According to Apple, on their Macbooks, after
about 1000 cycles, you’re left with only

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.180
about 80% of the battery’s original capacity,
maybe less, and it only gets worse from there.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.750
To solve this seemingly unavoidable issue,
researchers from University of California,

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.750
Irvine accidentally invented a battery that
never dies.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.190
Well, seemingly never.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.790
Apparently, a doctoral candidate in their
research lab was fooling around, and as we

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.879
all do for fun, she coated a set of gold nanowires
in manganese dioxide, and then sealed them

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.370
in an electrolyte gel.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.510
Hahaha, oh those scamps!

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.510
Manganese!

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.860
The trick is that nanowires conduct electricity
very very well and have a large surface area

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.240
to store and transfer electrons.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.879
But these wires are also SUPER fragile, and
they tend to break down after use.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.620
But coating the wires seems to have solved
this major problem.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.049
In the lab, this mini-battery went on to experience
200,000 charge cycles.

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.650
That's roughly 500 times more than the expected
optimal lifecycle of a lithium-ion battery,

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.440
while still operating between 94 and 96 percent
efficiency.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.680
Even after three months, the normally super-fragile
wires were still fully functional thanks to

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.680
their gel coating.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.560
Although its in the early research stage,
researchers think this battery could last

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.100
up to 400 years.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.451
But your smartphone is still gonna die in
a few years and that's because it's still

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:41.379
using technology from the 1970s.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.409
It's optimized, but obsolete.

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.849
A number of tech groups have developed small
scale solutions, a combination of which may

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:53.209
prove to be the next big battery breakthrough,
but as for now, most solutions are impractical

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.620
due to cost, longevity, and most importantly;
safety.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.709
New batteries need to be tested for a long
time before they’re introduced on the market.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.299
Just look at the Note 7.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:05.780
For now, it looks like battery life will continue
to suck.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.890
