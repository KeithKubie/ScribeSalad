[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:42.302 --> 00:00:44.010
DR. HASLENDA HASHIM:
Industrial processes

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.450
are highly energy intensive,
and currently account

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.350
for one third of
global energy use.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.590
CO2 emissions from
industries have increased

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.190
about 0.6% from 2012 to 2013.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.630
This is equivalent to adding
27 million cars on the road.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.760
How can industry
remain competitive

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.150
and commercially viable without
jeopardizing the environment?

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.080
One of the promising solutions
is the implementation

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.080
of industrial symbiosis.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.900
In this teaching module, I'll
present an industrial symbiosis

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.220
case study In Nusajaya,
Iskandar Malaysia.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.550
What is industrial symbiosis?

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.400
The concept of
industrial symbiosis

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.450
comes from natural ecosystems.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.040
Let's take a look
at a simple example.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.140
In nature, there is no
such thing as garbage.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.850
Outputs becomes inputs
for a different part

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.330
of the ecosystem.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.240
A falling leaf decomposes
into soil nutrients

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.430
when then allows tree to grow.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.870
In other words, waste
has become resource,

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:56.020
and the process is repeated
in a closed ecological system.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.950
The same principle is applied
in industrial symbiosis.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.150
Industrial symbiosis is
an innovative concept

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.640
where the byproduct, or
output, of one company

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.720
can become the raw
material of another company

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.570
by creating a closed
cycle of waste

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.670
resources between companies.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.280
It involves exchanges
of byproduct and energy

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.740
between companies.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.600
More than 170 successful
industrial symbioses

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.830
can be found in the world,
such as Kalundborg Symbiosis

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.120
Park in Denmark, Kawasaki
Eco Industrial Park in Japan,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.300
Smart Park in Texas,
USA, Ulsan in Korea,

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:42.280
[INAUDIBLE] Industrial
Park in China,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.420
and Green Industrial
Park in Nusajaya.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.635
In Malaysia,
industrial symbiosis

00:02:48.635 --> 00:02:51.540
is put into practice
in Iskandar Malaysia,

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.590
located in southern
peninsula Malaysia,

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.170
in a complex known as
the Southern Industrial

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.480
and Logistics Cluster
located in Nusajaya.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.220
Industrial symbiosis
in Nusajaya is

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.710
built as a network
of cooperation

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.470
between four biotech companies.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.200
The companies exchange
materials, byproduct,

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.040
or energy with each other.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.870
For example, one utility
company [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.820
is using palm oil waste as fuel
to give its steam steady supply

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.940
to nearby industries.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.960
Industrial waste generated
from other companies

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.580
will also be sent to
[INAUDIBLE] treatment facilities

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.380
for further processing, to
produce an alternative fuel

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.010
called bio-gas.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.160
The bio-gas generator can then
be used as a renewable energy

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.620
source to generate steam or
electricity to supply back

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.870
to the industrial area nearby.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.280
The waste left after
this process is then

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.360
sold as fertilizer.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.340
AS you can see, the
visualization clearly shows

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.180
the main concept of
industrial symbiosis,

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.600
which is utilization of one
company byproduct, energy,

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.000
or what is raw material
for another company

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.450
has been implemented
in Nusajaya.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.340
How can industrial
symbiosis reduce emissions,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.690
and generate economic benefits?

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.640
Or, in other words,
what is the advantages

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.839
of industrial symbiosis.

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:25.290
There are multiple advantages
industrial symbiosis.

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.290
First, the practice
significantly

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.640
reduces the volume of waste
being disposed in landfills.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.980
Second, the cost of raw material
and waste treatment is reduced.

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.900
Third, raw material,
energy, and water

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.660
are conserved, because
the byproduct always

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.300
are turned into raw material,
energy is recovered,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.940
and what there is used.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.690
Fourth, industrial
symbiosis also

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.820
leads to reduction in fuel
consumption and transportation

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:58.280
costs, due to shortened
transportation distances

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.900
for byproduct or
waste to the industry.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.270
As a result,
industrial symbiosis

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.810
could produce fewer
transportation-related

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.740
emissions.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.520
An sample of successful
industrial symbiosis

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.040
is Kalundborg It is the world's
first industrial symbiosis

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.560
site, and has been in operation
for more than 30 years.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.990
It has achieved significant
environmental and economic

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.790
returns.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:22.465
Through integrating
30 companies,

00:05:22.465 --> 00:05:29.260
Kalundborg has reduced about
160,000 tons of CO2 emissions,

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:33.360
and saved 3 million
meters cubed of water.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.170
The process also saved more than
$1 million US dollar annually,

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:42.000
all due to recycling and reuse
of industrial byproducts.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.470
in comparison, industrial
symbiosis in Nusajaya

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.450
has only been
operating since 2009,

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.480
and is still at
its infant stage.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.330
However, given the
benefit at Kalundborg,

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.640
industrial symbiosis in
Nusajaya in the long run

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.730
could be a very
promising strategy

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:07.170
to help reduce carbon emissions
by 50% in the Iskandar region

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:09.940
by 2025.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.470
This is in line with the action
plans in the low carbon society

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.860
blueprint for Iskandar Malaysia.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.300
As we all know,
our prime minister

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:22.320
was launched low carbons
blueprints in 2012.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:26.820
So could you please explain,
what is the insight low carbon

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.606
society blueprint for
Iskandar Malaysia.

00:06:29.606 --> 00:06:30.980
SPEAKER: I believe
we are talking

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.350
about this blueprint, the low
carbon society blueprint, that

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:38.630
actually give the 12
action framework for how

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.510
Iskandar nation should drive.

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.150
And it actually cover our three
main core component, economy,

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:47.530
[INAUDIBLE] and
also environment.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.470
And this 12 actions
plan is actually

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.950
looking at how each of us
can actually working together

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:57.200
to actually drive this
initiative in Iskandar

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.094
Malaysia.

00:06:58.094 --> 00:07:00.010
DR. HASLENDA HASHIM:
Successful implementation

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.010
of industrial symbiosis
will not happen by accident.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.230
Several challenges
need to be overcome

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:08.570
for the development of
industrial symbiosis

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.330
in Nusajaya to become
a successful model.

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:15.910
First issue is related
to logistic factor.

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:19.240
There are four palm oil mills
within 20 to 40 kilometers

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.310
in Iskandar Malaysia.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.810
These mills are a
potential supply of waste

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.030
to the industrial park.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:29.820
This long distance however
will require large storage

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.440
in industrial park to ensure the
continuous supply of palm oil

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.760
waste.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.290
Thus, it is recommended to site
industrial symbiosis in an area

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:43.280
adjacent or close to the source
of waste, such as palm oil

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.300
mills, to minimize the
cost of transportation,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:49.850
as well as reduce
the size of storage

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.970
needed for palm oil waste.

00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:57.590
Second, a major challenge
concerns laws and regulations.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.140
The national green technology
policy and feed-in tariffs

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.680
were established
in 2009 and 2011

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.490
to promote sustainable
development for industry

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:08.470
in Malaysia.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:12.400
However, there are no specific
regulations or policies

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:17.050
to encourage industry to
form symbiotic linkages.

00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:20.820
in Japan, for example, the
sound material cycle society

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.770
was formed.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:26.125
It consists of various recycling
and green purchasing laws

00:08:26.125 --> 00:08:29.740
to support the creating
and selling of waste

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:34.340
for industry inside and
outside the industrial park.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.120
This initiative will create
sufficient and comparatively

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.270
cheaper waste to use as
raw material for industry.

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.620
In addition to the lack
of appropriate policy,

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:47.350
lack of financial
support is also

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.250
one of the barriers that
hinder the development

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:54.310
of a more complex industrial
symbiosis park in Nusajaya.

00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:58.800
In Japan, for example,
227 million US dollar

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.960
were allocated by the government
to build new recycling plants

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.885
in Kawasaki Eco-Town in 1997.

00:09:05.885 --> 00:09:09.730
In Malaysia, the sustainable
energy development authority

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.430
provides financial incentive
in the form of feed-in tariffs.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:18.060
However, these incentive are
only beneficial for palm oil

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.180
industry park because
they have no cost

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:23.360
for waste or transportation.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.650
In addition to the factors
that I have just highlighted,

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:29.840
the concept of industrial
symbiosis in Nusajaya

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.340
can be extended to urban
symbiosis similar to the system

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:35.070
in Kalundborg.

00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:37.310
Special planning
factor, which is

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:41.370
the distance between industrial
park and residential area,

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:44.480
and strong linkages between
state and local government,

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.630
have contributed to
this integrated effort.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.460
The sustainable
supply of waste could

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.180
be generated from this effort,
since municipal waste could

00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:56.690
also become a source off
raw material for industry.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:01.800
In return, the municipality also
benefits from this initiative.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.320
Since the energy generated
by industrial symbiosis

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.000
will be supplied to
the municipality,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.116
thus reducing the municipality
heavy reliance on fossil fuel.

00:10:13.116 --> 00:10:14.990
What can be learned from
industrial symbiosis

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:16.580
in Nusajaya?

00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.860
And how can it be
duplicated elsewhere?

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:22.480
The case of industrial
symbiosis in Nusajaya

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.960
provides a good
lesson to accelerate

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:27.070
the development of
industrial symbiosis

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.700
in developing countries.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.810
The primary elements that
are necessary to support

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.930
the successful implementation
of industrial symbiosis

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:38.750
in other countries are,
first, availability

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.610
of renewable energy source.

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:45.230
Second, distance from the
renewable energy source

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:48.790
to the industrial park.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.240
Third, a strong regulatory
and legal structure

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.730
around climate
change mitigations.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.620
Fourth, financial incentives.

00:10:57.620 --> 00:11:01.840
Fifth, strong linkages
between national, state,

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.650
and local development
to encourage

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:07.730
integrated industrial
and urban symbiosis.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:10.250
Last but not least,
this initiative

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:13.660
would not be possible
without strong commitment

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:18.630
