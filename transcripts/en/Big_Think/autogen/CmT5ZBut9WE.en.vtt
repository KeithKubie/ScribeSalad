00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.430

recession can mean you're out of the
 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.800
recession can mean you're out of the
health care system second is it has to

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810
health care system second is it has to
 

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.110
health care system second is it has to
modernize the health care system so that

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120
modernize the health care system so that
 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.390

it we really get value for what we put
 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.260
it we really get value for what we put
into it the misconception that you

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270
into it the misconception that you
 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.020
into it the misconception that you
referenced is that the idea the goal is

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030
referenced is that the idea the goal is
 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.380
referenced is that the idea the goal is
to save money the goal is not to save

they're appropriate and not do them
 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.990
they're appropriate and not do them
where they're not appropriate which is a

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000
where they're not appropriate which is a
 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.730
where they're not appropriate which is a
way of looking at it that's much more

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:54.740
way of looking at it that's much more
 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.650

consistent with where people are and the
values that we have and then the third

values that we have and then the third
 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.760

the quality of care and lower spending
 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.590
the quality of care and lower spending
at the same time think about those

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600
at the same time think about those

not getting treated appropriately treat
 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.919
not getting treated appropriately treat
them more appropriately they don't go

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929
them more appropriately they don't go
 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:40.199
them more appropriately they don't go
into the hospital they spend less and

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209
into the hospital they spend less and
 

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:41.940
into the hospital they spend less and
their quality of life their length of

their quality of life their length of
 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.300
their quality of life their length of
life is increased that's what we can do

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310
life is increased that's what we can do
 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.779
life is increased that's what we can do
if we really do it right so yes we need

00:01:48.779 --> 00:01:48.789
if we really do it right so yes we need
 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.660
if we really do it right so yes we need
to save money but we will save money as

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670
to save money but we will save money as
 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.639
to save money but we will save money as
a byproduct of having a system that

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:53.649
a byproduct of having a system that
 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:56.339
a byproduct of having a system that
works better we're not going to save

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349
works better we're not going to save
 

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.139
works better we're not going to save
money by taking a meat axe and just

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149
money by taking a meat axe and just

Klein off some part of health care
spending that's what a lot of the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780
spending that's what a lot of the
 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.240
spending that's what a lot of the
alternative is if we don't do this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250
alternative is if we don't do this
 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.179
alternative is if we don't do this
what's going to happen probably a lot of

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:06.189
what's going to happen probably a lot of
 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:07.679
what's going to happen probably a lot of
employers will just say hey you know

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689
employers will just say hey you know
 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.419

what we're just going to stick you in a
health plan with very high cost share

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:11.049
health plan with very high cost share
 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.559
health plan with very high cost share
you go out and deal with it everything

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
you go out and deal with it everything
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.960
you go out and deal with it everything
we know is that people will stop taking

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970
we know is that people will stop taking
 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:18.089
we know is that people will stop taking
their medications they'll save money and

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099
their medications they'll save money and
 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.729
their medications they'll save money and
their health will deteriorate we have to

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739
their health will deteriorate we have to
 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.089
their health will deteriorate we have to
find a way and we believe there are ways

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099
find a way and we believe there are ways
 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:26.699
find a way and we believe there are ways
where we can save money and we can

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709
where we can save money and we can
 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.650
where we can save money and we can
improve health and people know this

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660
improve health and people know this
 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.960
improve health and people know this
people know that the health care system

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970
people know that the health care system
 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.449
people know that the health care system
costs more than it should and a part of

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459
costs more than it should and a part of
 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.009
costs more than it should and a part of
that is because the thing just doesn't

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019
that is because the thing just doesn't
 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.740
that is because the thing just doesn't
work right and you wind up having people

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750
work right and you wind up having people
 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.289
work right and you wind up having people
in very expensive circumstances after

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299
in very expensive circumstances after
 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.580
in very expensive circumstances after
the fact when you could have prevented

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590
the fact when you could have prevented
 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.520
the fact when you could have prevented
it so I don't think that convincing

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530
it so I don't think that convincing
 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.610
it so I don't think that convincing
people of that presumption is that hard

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620
people of that presumption is that hard
 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.490
people of that presumption is that hard
I think what we have to do is one make

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500
I think what we have to do is one make
 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.050
I think what we have to do is one make
sure we do that make sure we put the

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060
sure we do that make sure we put the
 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.599
sure we do that make sure we put the
steps in place to do that and second is

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609
steps in place to do that and second is
 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.520
steps in place to do that and second is
we need to make sure we don't demagogue

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
we need to make sure we don't demagogue
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.409
we need to make sure we don't demagogue
it so we just say to people oh what the

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419
it so we just say to people oh what the
 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:00.930
it so we just say to people oh what the
president wants is to ration your care

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
president wants is to ration your care
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.659
president wants is to ration your care
or what senator Kennedy wants is to make

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:03.669
or what senator Kennedy wants is to make
 

00:03:03.669 --> 00:03:05.339
or what senator Kennedy wants is to make
sure you don't get so we need to get

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349
sure you don't get so we need to get
 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:06.690
sure you don't get so we need to get
away from that because people without

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
away from that because people without
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640
away from that because people without
it's complicated enough no one's going

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650
it's complicated enough no one's going
 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.440
it's complicated enough no one's going
to understand all the details and if

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450
to understand all the details and if
 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.909
to understand all the details and if
people hear those things and they get

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:11.919
people hear those things and they get
 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:13.770
people hear those things and they get
scared then they'll be tempted to back

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780
scared then they'll be tempted to back
 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.270
scared then they'll be tempted to back
off and that would be just the worst of

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280
off and that would be just the worst of
 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.870
off and that would be just the worst of
all situations

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880
 
 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.780
 
I mean give you three examples of why we

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790
I mean give you three examples of why we
 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.970
I mean give you three examples of why we
have waste and how you could get rid of

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980
have waste and how you could get rid of
 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.980
have waste and how you could get rid of
them the first example is look at what

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990
them the first example is look at what
 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.750
them the first example is look at what
actual providers are doing on a

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760
actual providers are doing on a
 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.840
actual providers are doing on a
moment-to-moment basis so if you people

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:34.850
moment-to-moment basis so if you people
 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:37.840
moment-to-moment basis so if you people
done studies where you follow nurses in

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850
done studies where you follow nurses in
 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.820
done studies where you follow nurses in
a hospital with stopwatches or you have

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:39.830
a hospital with stopwatches or you have
 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.650
a hospital with stopwatches or you have
them carry a Palm Pilot that where they

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660
them carry a Palm Pilot that where they
 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.710
them carry a Palm Pilot that where they
record everything that they do the most

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720
record everything that they do the most
 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.320
record everything that they do the most
common thing that a nurse in a hospital

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.330
common thing that a nurse in a hospital
 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.310

responsibility for figuring out how to
 

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.879
responsibility for figuring out how to
do something different that's just one

to encourage innovation across the board

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:55.910
to encourage innovation across the board
 

00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:01.369
to encourage innovation across the board
or else it's not going to succeed

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:01.379
 
 

00:11:01.379 --> 00:11:04.309
 
I think innovation is going to be key to

I think innovation is going to be key to
 

00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:07.879
I think innovation is going to be key to
health care and if you say to me what's

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:07.889
health care and if you say to me what's
 

00:11:07.889 --> 00:11:09.679
health care and if you say to me what's
going to solve the health care problem

different kinds of innovation there are
innovations in medical devices and drugs

innovations in medical devices and drugs
 

00:11:17.429 --> 00:11:20.329

there was an old TV show Marcus Welby

00:11:35.149 --> 00:11:35.159
there was an old TV show Marcus Welby
 

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:37.460
there was an old TV show Marcus Welby
that probably the older listeners who

I think was the 1950s or so there is
 

00:11:45.299 --> 00:11:47.179
I think was the 1950s or so there is
nothing that is done in the medical

00:11:47.179 --> 00:11:47.189
nothing that is done in the medical
 

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:48.919
nothing that is done in the medical
system today that Marcus Welby would

00:11:48.919 --> 00:11:48.929
system today that Marcus Welby would
 

00:11:48.929 --> 00:11:52.699
system today that Marcus Welby would
recognize no procedure no pills nothing

00:11:52.699 --> 00:11:52.709
recognize no procedure no pills nothing
 

00:11:52.709 --> 00:11:55.309
recognize no procedure no pills nothing
but he would completely recognize how

00:11:55.309 --> 00:11:55.319
but he would completely recognize how

medical care is delivered it's a doctor

00:11:58.519 --> 00:11:58.529
medical care is delivered it's a doctor
 

00:11:58.529 --> 00:12:01.579
medical care is delivered it's a doctor
in an office with a patient and that's

00:12:01.579 --> 00:12:01.589
in an office with a patient and that's
 

00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:04.759
in an office with a patient and that's
what happens so almost nothing is the

00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:04.769
what happens so almost nothing is the
 

00:12:04.769 --> 00:12:07.789
what happens so almost nothing is the
same in the world today as it was in the

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:07.799
same in the world today as it was in the
 

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:11.509
same in the world today as it was in the
1950s accept the fact that we go about

00:12:11.509 --> 00:12:11.519
1950s accept the fact that we go about
 

00:12:11.519 --> 00:12:13.489
1950s accept the fact that we go about
providing medical care in the same way

00:12:13.489 --> 00:12:13.499
providing medical care in the same way
 

00:12:13.499 --> 00:12:16.279

let me just take one example of why that

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:16.289
let me just take one example of why that
 

00:12:16.289 --> 00:12:19.429
let me just take one example of why that
is so harmful if you look at patients

00:12:19.429 --> 00:12:19.439
is so harmful if you look at patients
 

00:12:19.439 --> 00:12:21.710
is so harmful if you look at patients
with chronic disease diabetes or

hypertension or high cholesterol many of
 

00:12:24.989 --> 00:12:27.439
hypertension or high cholesterol many of
them do not take the medications that

have side effects and they don't know
 

00:12:32.399 --> 00:12:34.879
have side effects and they don't know
how to deal with them so very easy to

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:34.889
how to deal with them so very easy to
 

00:12:34.889 --> 00:12:36.439
how to deal with them so very easy to
help them nurse practitioners can help

00:12:36.439 --> 00:12:36.449
help them nurse practitioners can help
 

00:12:36.449 --> 00:12:37.879

them physician's assistants that does

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:37.889
them physician's assistants that does

them physician's assistants that does
not have to be a doctor we do not pay

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:40.350
not have to be a doctor we do not pay
 

00:12:40.350 --> 00:12:42.529
not have to be a doctor we do not pay
for that we do to recognize that we do

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:42.539
for that we do to recognize that we do
 

00:12:42.539 --> 00:12:45.319
for that we do to recognize that we do
not allow that in most circumstances and

00:12:45.319 --> 00:12:45.329
not allow that in most circumstances and
 

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:46.699
not allow that in most circumstances and
the result is that those people are not

00:12:46.699 --> 00:12:46.709
the result is that those people are not
 

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:47.960
the result is that those people are not
treated well they wind up with

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:47.970
treated well they wind up with
 

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:50.539
treated well they wind up with

care system that's focused around
 

00:12:57.289 --> 00:13:00.199
care system that's focused around
helping the patient and if that means

00:13:00.199 --> 00:13:00.209
helping the patient and if that means
 

00:13:00.209 --> 00:13:01.699
helping the patient and if that means
that there's a nurse practitioner who's

00:13:01.699 --> 00:13:01.709
that there's a nurse practitioner who's
 

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:04.249
that there's a nurse practitioner who's
there to help you out hey great if that

00:13:04.249 --> 00:13:04.259
there to help you out hey great if that
 

00:13:04.259 --> 00:13:06.109
there to help you out hey great if that
means that that there's a physician's

00:13:06.109 --> 00:13:06.119
means that that there's a physician's
 

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.939
means that that there's a physician's
assistant or a group visit with lots of

00:13:07.939 --> 00:13:07.949
assistant or a group visit with lots of
 

00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:09.199

other people figured out how to do that

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:09.209
other people figured out how to do that
 

00:13:09.209 --> 00:13:11.049
other people figured out how to do that
then that's what we have to

00:13:11.049 --> 00:13:11.059
then that's what we have to
 

00:13:11.059 --> 00:13:15.249
then that's what we have to
able so far we almost prohibited we

00:13:15.249 --> 00:13:15.259
able so far we almost prohibited we
 

00:13:15.259 --> 00:13:17.319
able so far we almost prohibited we
don't help it we're not even neutral we

00:13:17.319 --> 00:13:17.329
don't help it we're not even neutral we
 

00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:18.969
don't help it we're not even neutral we
basically say we're not going to allow

00:13:18.969 --> 00:13:18.979
basically say we're not going to allow
 

00:13:18.979 --> 00:13:21.519
basically say we're not going to allow
that which is just a huge huge mistake

00:13:21.519 --> 00:13:21.529
that which is just a huge huge mistake
 

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:23.289
that which is just a huge huge mistake
and it's something that's going to have

00:13:23.289 --> 00:13:23.299
and it's something that's going to have
 

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:25.209
and it's something that's going to have
to be have to be very different or else

00:13:25.209 --> 00:13:25.219
to be have to be very different or else
 

00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:26.799

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.759
 
a lot of the innovations in health care

00:13:33.759 --> 00:13:33.769
a lot of the innovations in health care
 

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:35.590
a lot of the innovations in health care
recently have come from a couple of

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600
recently have come from a couple of
 

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.910
recently have come from a couple of
places one is the kind of analyst

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:39.920
places one is the kind of analyst
 

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.560

reform effort 16 years ago where you

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:45.769
reform effort 16 years ago where you
 

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:47.009
reform effort 16 years ago where you
know have much more attention

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:47.019
know have much more attention
 

00:13:47.019 --> 00:13:49.150

information technology and how you'd

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:49.160
information technology and how you'd
 

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.680
information technology and how you'd
eliminate waste and so on none of what

you saw and then the what's very
 

00:13:53.209 --> 00:13:54.449
you saw and then the what's very
interesting is the provider community

00:13:54.449 --> 00:13:54.459
interesting is the provider community
 

00:13:54.459 --> 00:13:57.519
interesting is the provider community
has a number and ensure community for

not going to tolerate patients getting

not going to tolerate patients getting
 

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.860
not going to tolerate patients getting
substandard care care that's not as good

substandard care care that's not as good
 

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:10.569
substandard care care that's not as good

table and I'm going to try and see where
 

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:37.990
table and I'm going to try and see where
we can agree about what to do this is a

00:17:37.990 --> 00:17:38.000
we can agree about what to do this is a
 

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.690
we can agree about what to do this is a
very very hard policy problem it's

00:17:40.690 --> 00:17:40.700
very very hard policy problem it's
 

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:42.430
very very hard policy problem it's
probably the hardest policy problem we

00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:42.440
probably the hardest policy problem we
 

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.740
probably the hardest policy problem we
have today and what people are trying to

00:17:44.740 --> 00:17:44.750
have today and what people are trying to
 

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.840
have today and what people are trying to
do is gather around and see can they

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:46.850
do is gather around and see can they
 

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:48.700
do is gather around and see can they
produce some consensus that really makes

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:48.710
produce some consensus that really makes
 

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:53.169
produce some consensus that really makes
sense and i'm somewhat hopeful that this

00:17:53.169 --> 00:17:53.179
sense and i'm somewhat hopeful that this
 

00:17:53.179 --> 00:17:54.910
sense and i'm somewhat hopeful that this
time we'll do it even if in the past

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:54.920
time we'll do it even if in the past
 

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.670
time we'll do it even if in the past
we've been unable to

00:17:58.670 --> 00:17:58.680
 
 

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.740
 
you
