00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.912
We can notice that we have an x squared and an x here. So, one of our x's from

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:08.166
the top will cancel with the x from the bottom. We can also combine our two

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:14.525
coefficients by just dividing 1.932 over 2. That gives us a reduced form of

00:00:14.525 --> 00:00:19.707
0.966x times x plus 10 over 11x plus 50.
