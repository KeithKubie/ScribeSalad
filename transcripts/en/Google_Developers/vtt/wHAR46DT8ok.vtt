00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.390
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: How is it going, everyone?
&gt;&gt; Terrific.

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:16.500
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: Have a seat, please. We are about
to begin.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.720
Hi.
So my name is Wayne Pan. I'm lead -- front-end

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.670
engineer on the Google ads team.
I am not here today to talk to you about how

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.990
to build a mobile application but how to build
a mobile business and the tools we have available

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.070
for you to actually do that.
I game to Google about a year ago through

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.070
the AdMob acquisition and a few years before
that we were building a successful ad network

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.692
on WAP, for those of you that remember WAP.
And then all of a sudden the iPhone happened

00:00:47.692 --> 00:00:56.610
and I was part of the team that led the development
of our first i OS ads SDK. And just like everyone

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.070
else we were completely shocked and blown
away at the growth in the coming years.

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:11.079
And then we started expanding our platform
onto multiple emerging platforms, like Android,

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:19.639
Web OS, and now Windows phone 7.
Every month, at last count, more than 50,000

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:24.929
applications monetized with AdMob and Google
every month.

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:30.039
So as the mobile ecosystem, mobile app ecosystem
evolves and develops, developers need to evolve

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.810
and develop and so do the tools.
So today we are going to give you an overview

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.579
of how mobile advertising works in mobile
applications, and more advanced topics such

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:48.020
as cross-motion, mediation, and even analytics.
So hopefully by the end of this session you

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.460
guys will have a better idea how to build
a mobile business, whether or not you have

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.069
a company and a team that you are already
working with or you simply have an idea.

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:02.909
So before we get started, here is the QR code
to leave feedback for the session. If this

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.740
session is useful, how well I am doing as
a speaker, things like that. Please leave

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.710
feedback for all your sessions. That's how
we know we can improve I/O.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:18.340
If you are twitting use io2011 and you guys
are on the Android track so use the hashtag

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.450
Android.
If you guys have questions you can login Google

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.990
moderator. There is the URL. I will put this
slide up at the end of the presentation also.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.550
So how many of you out there have actually
built an app and put it in the app store or

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:40.170
marketplace? Raise your hands. Quite a few
of you guys. All right.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.110
So how do you actually make money off of applications?
I am going to go through four basic mobile

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:51.660
business strategies.
So first of all, paid downloads. Pretty obvious.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.310
You put the app in the app store or marketplace.
You charge the user a fee, let's say a $1.99,

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.680
and you take a cut after the app store or
marketplace or sometimes even the carrier

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.390
has taken a cut.
It's a one-time monetization fee. Games are

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.120
very successful with this strategy.
Keep in mind these aren't succinct business

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.380
models, but you can mix and match and use
a variety of them. I am just going to explain

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.540
to you what each one of them refer, to the
strategy behind them.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:33.050
The next one is freemium. This is where you,
as a developer, put an application, sometimes

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.300
ad supported, sometimes with limited functionality,
you put it in the app store for free and you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.780
build your audience and you get a bunch of
users and you try to up-sell them or convert

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.290
them into a paid download, either by offering
them incentives, such as more features, more

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:55.440
levels, or simply removing the ads if your
free app is ad supported.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.530
Many businesses are successful with this.
One of them is Outfit 7. They produce an app

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:08.040
called Talking Tomcat. If you have kids, kids
love this app. My nieces and nephews love

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.120
it. It's a little cat that talks and it's
ad supported. You can download a paid version

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.840
and you will get more voices, more gestures,
things like that. They have a variety of talking

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.490
animal apps.
The next business strategy is in app purchases

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:33.400
or virtual goods. This is where you put in
a, most often, free application in the app

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:41.460
store, and you monetize your users with virtual
goods, either more levels, selling them more

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:50.310
gold for a price or a better sword. Our good
friends at Realview have used this strategy

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.650
successfully in Angry Birds. Even though it's
a paid app, they offered a virtual good called

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:01.840
the mighty eagle. For 99 cents, you can pay
them to get this massive bird called the mighty

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.909
eagle that will allow you to skip a level.
It's very successful. They found a way to

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:11.400
use virtual goods to monetize their game.
If you get a chance, definitely look it up.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.050
It's a very good case study on how they were
successfully able to do that.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.330
So the last one which we're going to focus
on today is advertising.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:29.020
So first of all, what is advertising? We work
with thousands of publishers. Like I said,

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:35.240
we have over 50,000 publishers and apps -- or
50,000 apps monetizing with our platform.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:43.900
Ads, what you do is, as a developer, you download
our SDK. AdMob and Google conveniently provide

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.439
one. There are many more ad networks out there,
though. You download the SDK as a developer.

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:53.270
You, as a developer, get to choose where the
ads show up in the app, how often they show

00:05:53.270 --> 00:06:01.850
up. It's very simple integration.
So you integrate, you launch the app in the

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:07.409
app store or marketplace. The user downloads
your app. They open it, they play the game

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.499
or they use the application. They come across
an ad that's relevant to them or that they

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:18.080
want to check out. They tap on it, and you
make some money. It's simple as that.

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:25.259
Now, keep in mind that this is -- You have
the choice on how often and where you want

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:30.069
the ads to be shown. So that means every time
a user opens an application, you have a chance

00:06:30.069 --> 00:06:34.669
to monetize them, versus some of the other
business models, it's more of a one-time thing.

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.410
But with advertising, users get a free app.
They like that because they don't have to

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:46.270
pay, and you as a developer get to monetize
every time a user is engaged with the application.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:51.210
We have a session tomorrow, some of the AdMob
engineers are going to show you how to integrate

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:58.749
both, I think, the Android and iOS and Windows
7 SDKs. It's at 1:45 tomorrow. So if you have

00:06:58.749 --> 00:07:02.069
time and you are interested, please attend
that session. I think it's in Room 9.

00:07:02.069 --> 00:07:09.240
So let's talk a little bit more about advertising
and -- whoops.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:16.349
Hold on one second here.
Sorry. I jumped ahead.

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:23.150
So let's talk a little bit more about the
terms behind advertising. So these are some

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:27.610
basic concepts on advertising. If you are
familiar with these, don't worry. This will

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.930
go by pretty quickly.
The first term we are going to talk about

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.039
is cost per click or CPC. This is how much
money you get paid when a user clicks on an

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:38.620
ad.
We are going to go through some examples so

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.650
we are going to use example numbers here and
in our examples we are going to use ten cents

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.629
as a cost per click. So you get paid ten cents
every time a user clicks on an ad -- or clicks

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:53.680
on an ad in your application.
The next term is ad request. This is when

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:59.629
your application goes out to the ad network
and says I want to show an ad. Simple as that.

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:03.289
So in the examples we are going to use 120,000
ad requests.

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:07.899
Now, this is different than impressions, which
is the next term. An impression is actually

00:08:07.899 --> 00:08:13.389
when an ad is shown in your application and
the user has a chance to click on it. So not

00:08:13.389 --> 00:08:18.040
every ad request results in an impression,
and I will explain that later and the terms

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.599
behind that.
And in our example, as I said, 100,000 impressions.

00:08:23.599 --> 00:08:30.409
The ads were shown 100,000 times.
The fourth one on this slide is clicks. So

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:35.061
we're going to use 1500 clicks, and clicks
are self-explanatory. That's when the user

00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:43.910
actually taps on an ad in your application.
So combining some of these terms is a more

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:50.150
advanced term called click-through rate. This
is a good measurement for when -- a measurement

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:55.040
of how relevant the ads are to the users.
So click-through rate is calculated by clicks

00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:01.000
divided by impressions. So in our example,
like I said, 1500 clicks divided by 100,000

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.750
impressions results in a 1.5% CTR. So 1.5%
of the time a user saw an ad, they liked it

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:15.900
and clicked on it because it was helpful to
them, and so in our example, 1.5% CTR.

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.560
The next term is revenue, how much money you
are making.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:25.620
That's calculated by the number of clicks
multiplied by the cost per click, pretty easy.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:32.250
1500 clicks multiplied by ten cents results
in $150 in revenue.

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:37.270
So for these numbers, the publisher here made
$150.

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:45.460
Now, the next term is a little bit more advanced
term, eCPM. This is effective cost per million.

00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:53.800
It's essentially, in simple terms, how much
money am I expected to make per thousand impressions.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:10:01.780
This is a common metric to gauge ad networks.
It's not the only network, but it is one of

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:06.400
the most useful ones because there's multiple
ways you can buy advertising. In our examples

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:11.310
we are only use CPC. It's every time someone
clicks on an ad, you get paid. There's another

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:18.960
way to buy advertising, such as CPM. You can
get paid on an impression basis. CPA or cost

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.520
per acquisition. You get paid when there is
acquisition.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:29.560
So eCPM is a way to measure across -- to level
the playing field and kind of have one metric

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:34.840
to judge how much money you are going to make
off of different ad networks.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:40.130
So the calculation is revenue divided by a
thousand -- or divided by impressions multiplied

00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:47.210
by a thousand. So that's expected cost per
-- or expected revenue per thousand impressions.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:53.930
So in our example, 150 divided by 100,000
times a thousand, $1.50. So for every thousand

00:10:53.930 --> 00:11:01.030
impressions, you expect to make $1.50. Pretty
straightforward.

00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:08.510
I said earlier not every ad request results
in an impression, and that number is called

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:16.950
fill rate. It's essentially impressions divided
by ad requests. So in this example, 100,000

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:23.200
impressions from 120,000 ads, 83% fill rate.
Now, fill rate some people would expect to

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:31.070
be 100 percent but there are many reasons
why an ad request doesn't result in an impression.

00:11:31.070 --> 00:11:38.970
There are things such as available ad inventory.
GO is a large one. There may not be a relevant

00:11:38.970 --> 00:11:46.030
ad to serve to someone in Finland, for example.
It's just a fact of ad networks, and not reaching

00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:51.640
100 percent fill is common and it's not something
that should be looked down upon because it's

00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:58.310
-- it shows that we want -- as an ad network
and as a developer, too, you want to show

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.010
the most relevant ad to your user. And in
some cases there may not be one. Simple as

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.410
that.
Let's combine all these terms I have been

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:15.620
talking about into a more complicated scenario.
So in this scenario that's on the screen back

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:22.120
there, ad network A is offering you a dollar
eCPM. That's $1 for every thousand ad impressions.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:31.440
They are offering you 83% fill rate. So your
expected revenue per thousand requests is

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.800
going to be a dollar multiplied by 83%, or
83 cents. So for every ad request, you are

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:42.840
going to make 83 cents.
Now, ad network B is offering you a $3 eCPM,

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:48.990
which is $2 more than network A, yet they
only fill 25% of their ad requests. So for

00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:54.650
every hundred ad requests, you only get 25
ads.

00:12:54.650 --> 00:13:04.360
So $3 eCPM multiplied by 25% fill rate, 75
cents. So you can see eCPM of network B is

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.470
much larger than network A but you will be
make being more money, your revenue will be

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:14.950
much higher -- or higher than with Network
A, going with ad network A.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:21.800
So as a developer, you are probably thinking
to yourself, okay, so what if I want to use

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:29.130
both ad networks? Maybe why should I stick
with one? And you would be right.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:36.860
So for those of you that have apps in the
marketplace or apps store and are using advertising

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:45.230
to monetize -- How many of you are using more
than one ad network? Only a few of you. Okay.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:49.670
So I am going to show you why you would want
to use more than one ad network.

00:13:49.670 --> 00:13:57.740
So this is a chart of eCPM over time, of just
some fictitious ad network A.

00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.630
eCPM fluctuates for a variety of reasons,
just like fill fluctuates. Campaigns coming

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:12.600
online, different mix in inventory, seasonality.
Q4 is a big quarter for ads. So it's natural

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:19.880
to have CPMs fluctuate over any given amount
of time. It's natural.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.891
But not every ad network's CPM fluctuates
-- or eCPM fluctuates in the same way. So

00:14:25.891 --> 00:14:32.280
in this case, ad network A's eCPM is lower
at the beginning of whatever we have as time

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:39.840
there than network B's, but it goes above
network B in the middle and then C takes over,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.150
so on and so on.
So as a developer, what would you do in this

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:52.320
scenario? Should you pick A? Should you pick
B? Should you pick C?

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:56.640
Well, you obviously want to make the most
money. That's what you guys all want to do;

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.240
right? We want you guys to make the most money.
So to accomplish that, you would want to be

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:09.751
on the top of all these charts. So you want
to pick the highest or optimal eCPM at any

00:15:09.751 --> 00:15:14.640
given time, no matter what network. You want
to serve that ad network's ad at any given

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:22.000
time. So what you want to do is called mediate.
You want to mediate between multiple ad networks.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:28.920
And mediation means in any ad slot, so in
this application here arcs the top of that

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:36.190
-- there's one ad slot at the top of this
app, and mediation allows you to serve any

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:40.250
ad network into that ad slot.
Let's say this week, ad network A is making

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.650
the most money. You can serve ad network A's
into that ad slot. Next week, it's ad network

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:48.780
B.
This is a little bit more complicated on mobile

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:53.920
than it is on desktop because users download
apps and you can't change things on the fly.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:00.560
So mediation is important. So Google and AdMob
offer a free solution. This is 100 percent

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:07.540
open source. It's called ad whirl. It's at
AdWhirl.com. You can use it free of charge

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:12.340
and you can also look at the code to know
that we're not doing anything fishy.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.910
You can even launch your own version of AdWhirl,
if you want. It's that open.

00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:22.550
And AdWhirl allows you to use unlimited number
of ad networks, any number of them. You can

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:28.029
turn them on and off on the fly in real time.
You can change allocation percentages. You

00:16:28.029 --> 00:16:34.070
can maximize your revenue by using mediation.
There's many other mediation solutions out

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:40.180
there. This one provides some pretty basic
functionality. And we understand that mediation

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:46.620
is important, so we're building mediation
as the core functionality of AdMob. We are

00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:49.690
not ready to announce anything yet but we
are going to have an announcement in a few

00:16:49.690 --> 00:16:53.779
weeks, so stay tuned for that.
Okay.

00:16:53.779 --> 00:17:02.220
So you have built an app, and you have started
monetizing that. Now what's the next natural

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:07.360
step? It's to build another app; right?
So further of you who raised your hands earlier

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:15.550
who have built an app, how many have built
another, a second app? Quite a few. Okay.

00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:22.050
All right.
So let's take a look at active users over

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:29.090
time. This chart represents the adoption of
app A over time. It's a pretty common curve.

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.210
Many apps are different. This is not applicable
to every app, but this is a pretty common

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:39.370
adoption curve. Little bit slow at first,
reaches a peak. Some users tail off, and you

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:44.530
have some sticky users at the end.
When you build a second app, or let's say

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:52.130
there's another app, it would follow generally
the same adoption curve. Now, app A and app

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.410
B could be from different publishers, but
if you guys have built two apps or multiple

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:04.501
apps, do you actually have control over app
A and app B. So how could you take advantage

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:11.320
of that to increase or -- increase the slope
of the user adoption of app B? How could you

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:16.309
somehow take advantage? You already have an
app. You already have an active user base,

00:18:16.309 --> 00:18:20.780
to start getting users on app B or to start
building a brand, start building a business.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:25.480
If you can do something like that, it would
be awesome; right?

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:32.460
You increase the slope. App B's adoption skyrockets
and you get users right away for your successive

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:37.160
apps.
So it turns out you can because you have app

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:45.920
A. And doing this is called cross-promoting,
or house ads, as our feature is called.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:51.980
What you are doing is you are taking your
active users from app A and driving them to

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:59.100
also adopt your second application. And I
will show you how to do that in a bit. But

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:04.520
here is a little case study of one of the
most successful -- or one of our more successful

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:08.530
cross-promoters on Internet network. This
is Backflip Studios. You guys may know them

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:14.240
from Paper Toss.
So in this slide here, you can see that they

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.950
are using Strike Knight and Nin Jump. At the
bottom, you see an ad for Buganoids on both

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:25.559
those applications. So users or players of
Strike Knight and Nin Jump, they see the ad

00:19:25.559 --> 00:19:31.010
Buganoids, they click on it, and they land
on the app store's landing page, and they

00:19:31.010 --> 00:19:35.680
see it's also from Backflip. Hey, I like Strike
Knight, I like Nin Jump. Why shouldn't I try

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.750
out Buganoids?
We find that cross-promoting and house ads

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:46.370
cause a much higher conversion rate because
and if users like your application, they will

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:52.760
generally trust you and download successive
apps. And Backflip Studios has built a brand

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.040
around this, has built a business, an actual
business.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:03.190
So I am going to show you a demo of how to
create a house ad using AdMob. So hopefully

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:13.740
this will work.
All right. So this is AdMob.com. It's a free

00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:16.600
service, self-service. You can sign up, AdMob.com
if you haven't already. I am going to show

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:23.170
you a small section which is just our house
ads functionality to create a cross-promotion

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:32.810
ad.
So I am going to play the role of the publisher.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:38.820
I have an app out there, it's called Golden
Gate Defender, it's a game. I have created

00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.940
another app called Aliens Attack, and I want
to start cross-promoting it. I want to drive

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:48.920
users that are using Golden Gate Defenders
into Aliens Attack.

00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:57.780
So I come to AdMob.com. I go to the house
ad section. I create an ad. It's an Android

00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:03.330
marketplace ad -- or app, so I am going to
link to the marketplace. I am just going to

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:21.520
call it Aliens Attack promo. So the URL is
basically the URL of your marketplace app.

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:26.990
And I want to advertise that in my app, which
is Golden Gate defense.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:36.080
And then from there, I can start to choose
where I want the ads to show up.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:39.440
I've already picked I want it to show up in
Golden Gate Defense. But what countries I

00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.980
do want it to show up in?
I'm actually just going to pick U.S., because

00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:49.530
maybe I haven't internationalized the app
yet. You can see here, you can highly target

00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:54.530
via Geo which -- where this app shows up.
So let's say you want to make a heavy push

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:58.780
into Germany, you can pick Germany and run
a promo for that.

00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:04.140
And you can pick just any country that you
want.

00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:08.390
After that, I can pick which devices I want
this to run on. So the first one is going

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:14.610
to be -- or my first option is to run on all
Android devices. I can pick specific Android

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:20.970
devices here. This is a list of all the Android
devices that are in our network or they're

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:28.280
using your application. So you can see it
gets very specific. Google Nexus One, et cetera,

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:32.660
et cetera, G2.
You can also pick which versions. So let's

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:39.870
say my new game, Aliens Attack, only works
on Android 2.0. So I can pick 2.0. Then, from

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:45.460
there, I just simply need to create the ad.
So we offer banner ads and text ads. I'm just

00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:49.770
going to create a regular text ad. The lowest
barrier to entry.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:54.770
I can upload a custom tile, which is this
one here, or I can just pick a standard one.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:23:00.880
I'm just going to pick a standard one for
this demo here. That's this little thing on

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.490
the left.
This is what my ad is going to look like.

00:23:04.490 --> 00:23:14.390
So I'm going to start typing. Download Aliens
Attack free now. And that's it.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:19.960
My ad is done. I hit "create ad," and finish.
And there you go. And my ad's created. This

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.870
will run in my Golden Gate Defense, the users
will see this ad. If they like Golden Gate

00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:30.800
Defense, hopefully, they'll download my Aliens
Attack game.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.780
In here, there's a bunch of reporting after
the fact. It will immediately be scheduled,

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.550
start running. You can track clicks, your
conversion rate. You can track all kinds of

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:48.130
things. We have some enhancements coming up
to House ads that will be coming in a couple

00:23:48.130 --> 00:23:54.180
weeks also. So stay tuned.
Hopefully this works again.

00:23:54.180 --> 00:24:03.400
All right. All right. So now we've talked
about how to make money off of the applications,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:08.059
all the business models that are available.
We've talked about how to cross-promote your

00:24:08.059 --> 00:24:12.020
applications. We could, you know, jump-start
your successive applications.

00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:19.510
So let's talk about what do you do now? There's
a lot going on. You've got a business, you've

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:25.633
got a couple apps, maybe your cross-promoting,
you're making money. What should you do? You

00:24:25.633 --> 00:24:29.980
should start to measure and analyze your business;
right?

00:24:29.980 --> 00:24:34.600
Next logical step.
How many of you who have shipped an app also

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.090
have an Analytics package in your app?
A few people. All right, you guys are on the

00:24:40.090 --> 00:24:49.600
right track.
So we -- well, if you're Android developer,

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.370
there are -- this is -- screen looks probably
very familiar to you. Simply the number of

00:24:53.370 --> 00:25:00.580
downloads that you have for your application
over time. And you can get a little bit -- slightly

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:05.590
deeper by looking at which countries your
apps have been downloaded in.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:12.420
But what's lacking here is, you know, deeper
metrics, like user loyalty, engagement. How

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:17.540
many people have reached level 5 in your application?
What is the most-used feature in your application?

00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:24.090
Where should you focus your energy on? Where
should you be devoting your development resources

00:25:24.090 --> 00:25:28.980
on? Maybe nobody has reached level 10. Is
there a bug in my app? Maybe. I don't know.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.570
So how do you do that?
Well, you can use Google Analytics. We provide

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:42.200
a mobile ads SDK -- or mobile Google Analytics
SDK that provides the same great functionality

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.410
as Google Analytics desktop. You can measure
engagement, loyalty, all those things I just

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:48.610
said.
In this example here, this is actual data

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:57.880
from an app. This is visitor loyalty. So this
is measuring over the last three days how

00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:03.620
many repeated uses -- how many users have
repeatedly used my app.

00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:08.260
So if you can't read it, it's a little bit
hard to read, but the bucket that has the

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:14.280
most is 15 to 25 times, followed very closely
by 25 to 50 times. And that tells me a lot.

00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:21.600
That tells me that my users are engaging and
using my app at least once a day. A lot of

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:28.400
them. At least 34%. I can't do the math in
my head. But a lot of them are using my app

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.410
every single day. That's great. 'Cause if
I'm monetizing, like I said, with ads, every

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.350
time the user engages with my application,
I have a chance to monetize them.

00:26:37.350 --> 00:26:44.080
So for a majority of my users, I'm monetizing
them every day.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.160
Now, if you install Google Analytics and your
chart looks a little different, there's maybe

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:53.310
some improvements that you can do. But without
Google Analytics, you won't know this deep

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:59.870
dive into data. You won't know anything more
than just past downloads. And if you can't,

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:04.600
you know -- if you don't know these metrics,
like, you can't improve it. That's the basic

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.600
concept of good engineering, right? If you
can't measure it, you can't improve it.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.570
So getting started with Google Analytics is
-- or Analytics for Mobile Applications is

00:27:13.570 --> 00:27:24.200
very easy. Download the SDK, available in
iOS and Android. Code.Google/mobile/analytics.

00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.600
And then go to Google Analytics or sign up
for an Analytics account as you would any

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:34.400
other site. And then create a profile for
your app. There's the -- the Google Analytics

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:40.140
team is doing a session tomorrow also at 12:30.
Please attend if you're interested in doing

00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:43.950
some deeper integrations.
And going to go through deeper concepts than

00:27:43.950 --> 00:27:51.700
we're going to cover here.
They launched last week something called e-commerce

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:56.960
tracking. This is applicable if you're selling
virtual goods, you can actually measure which

00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.190
virtual good is doing well, which ones do
users like. Is it the blue sword or the green

00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:06.010
sword, et cetera. If you're selling actual
goods, you can do the same e-commerce tracking

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:12.570
that you would do on a desktop site.
They also launched Android referral tracking.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:18.380
If you're advertising your app, you can see
which sources are driving the most engaged

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:27.180
users. Where am I spending my money and getting
the most value. And it may turn out that House

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.419
ads you're getting the most value, so you
may be wanting to devote some of your inventory

00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:36.400
-- forgoing some of your ad inventory for
House ads. These are things that you can find

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:46.260
out with Google Analytics.
So we covered building -- or building a mobile

00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:52.930
business, all the ways you can monetize; cross-promotion,
cross-promoting your apps. Mediating, using

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:59.299
more than one ad network, which we are totally
cool with you doing. And Analytics.

00:28:59.299 --> 00:29:03.620
So all these, we're launching a new site,
this is actually -- we're actually announcing

00:29:03.620 --> 00:29:09.830
it in this session, called the App Galaxy
Map. It's at guidetotheappgalaxy.com.

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:17.880
It covers measuring, promoting, earning, everything
we covered in this session today, plus case

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:24.830
studies from successful businesses. It's a
really cool, well-put-together microsite.

00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:29.490
And we hope you like it. We're launching it
and announcing it here.

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:38.820
So 
with that, we're going to move on to Q&amp;A.

00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:46.380
So if you have questions, please come up to
the mike in the front. And I'll hopefully

00:29:46.380 --> 00:30:06.750
answer them.
[ Applause ]

00:30:06.750 --> 00:30:11.510
&gt;&gt;&gt; I'm curious if there is ever a chance
that Google will allow us to have a special

00:30:11.510 --> 00:30:16.750
permission specifically for Analytics so that
we're not required to incur the full Internet

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:20.690
permission if we just need to send Analytics
data.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:26.410
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: I actually don't know the answer
to that. I'm not sure if they're having office

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:31.490
hours, but that would be something to ask
them. Or I can ask and you can find me offline.

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.590
But that's definitely a good thing to find
out.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:39.970
So --
&gt;&gt;&gt; When I -- when are you guys going to support

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:44.830
larger ad formats on AdWhirl?
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: On AdWhirl?

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.510
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: Like I said when I mentioned

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:56.970
AdWhirl, we're actually developing mediation
into our core AdMob product. We're not ready

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:03.130
to announce anything yet. But if you find
me after, I can maybe show you a sneak preview.

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:08.990
&gt;&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: I'm going to take a question

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:13.900
from the moderator.
The first question is which ad position does

00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:18.340
Google recommend which would generate the
most revenue in Android apps.

00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:26.600
We've had a bunch of experience with this,
multiple publishers. We find the way -- where

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:32.020
you put your ad has a great effect on how
much money you're going to make.

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:35.630
Users generally don't want to be -- if you're
using -- if they're using your app, let's

00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:40.870
say it's a game, they generally don't want
to be bothered by an ad. So they're not -- probably

00:31:40.870 --> 00:31:45.580
not likely to click on it. Like, if I'm sitting
down and ready to play a game and the first

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:49.630
thing I see is an ad, no, I want to play your
game. That's why I opened your app in the

00:31:49.630 --> 00:31:53.710
first place.
So we found -- let's talk about games specifically.

00:31:53.710 --> 00:32:00.010
We found that if you put your ad in between
levels or at the end of a score screen, you

00:32:00.010 --> 00:32:05.760
know, the user has consumed your app, they're
done with it, they'll most likely -- at that

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.820
point, they'll be ready to click on an ad.
They'll be ready to go somewhere else.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:14.490
So you need to think -- as a developer, you
need to think what would I want as a user.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:17.730
You don't want users to leave your application.
You want them to engage. You want to give

00:32:17.730 --> 00:32:19.860
them a good experience. You want them to come
back.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:26.120
So we find that putting an ad placement in
the -- in a spot in which users are ready

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:30.380
to move on to the next thing or they're finished
with your experience is the best place and

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.020
it's going to definitely make you the most
money.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:39.980
&gt;&gt;&gt; So I was wondering, are there tools to
get competitive data, competitive application

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:44.450
data, how they're doing versus how my app
is doing statistically?

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:50.570
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: Application on how many downloads
or were you talking about --

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:55.580
&gt;&gt;&gt; So if I have a gaming application of a
certain kind, then how are the other gaming

00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:58.140
applications doing?
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: In what metric?

00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:05.100
&gt;&gt;&gt; Competitive, as in someone else is giving
information how they are performing in Android

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:10.160
Market versus mine.
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: So you can rank in the Appstore

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:18.130
is good one obviously. There's no tools that
we have that you can build. But, I mean, we

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:22.620
found the developer community is pretty -- they're
willing to share. There's probably a bunch

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.799
of developers. The person next to you has
probably developed a game application, so

00:33:25.799 --> 00:33:32.400
you can probably ask them. Yeah. I'm sorry.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:39.070
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. Is Google Analytics open source? And
how is it compared to Flurry?

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:47.030
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: I think the server side is open
sourced. I'm not sure if the SDK is. I believe

00:33:47.030 --> 00:33:56.440
so. But it's -- Flurry's a great product.
And actually one of our good friends. But

00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:02.900
Google Analytics is -- we're adapting the
-- all the features they have in Google Analytics,

00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:09.560
which is, I believe, one of the leading free
Analytics solutions, onto mobile. So all the

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:13.369
great features that you know and love from
desktop version of Google Analytics or Web

00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:17.399
site versions, you'll be able to take advantage
and do deep tracking, deep thinking, all the

00:34:17.399 --> 00:34:22.440
great stuff that you'll do in desktop, we're
going to make them available -- or they are

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.580
available in Google Analytics Mobile. So I
can't say feature for feature which one is

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.620
better, but -- I don't know if that answers
your question.

00:34:29.620 --> 00:34:33.870
But definitely --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there anything that Google Analytics

00:34:33.870 --> 00:34:39.940
-- Analytics can do that Flurry can't?
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: I don't know. You're going to

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:44.310
have to ask the Google Analytics team. Or
I can hook you up with one of them if you

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:48.000
find me after.
&gt;&gt;&gt; Okay. Thanks.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:55.470
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: Okay. Well, we're going to take
one more question from Google Moderator here.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:00.770
So this question is what is the best way to
make money with an app, free, ad supported,

00:35:00.770 --> 00:35:08.450
or paid app?
So it really depends. We like advertising,

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:12.900
obviously. Advertising-supported apps. Users
love them because they don't have to pay to

00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:19.170
experience your app. And like I said, a paid
app download is a one-time monetization event.

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:23.960
The user pays you when they download the app.
They get to use it indefinitely.

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:29.980
With ads, you can monetize every time the
user engages in your app. So it really depends.

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.810
I mean, some apps are better as a sale. Some
apps are better with ads. Some apps are better

00:35:34.810 --> 00:35:40.110
with virtual goods. It just all depends on
what your app is and who your target audience

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.850
is.
So....

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:50.920
&gt;&gt;&gt; Hi. I would like to know, on AdMob, if
there are any other ways for getting more

00:35:50.920 --> 00:36:01.490
relevant ads other than filtering the categories.
&gt;&gt;Wayne Pan: So we have -- so filtering the

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:07.910
categories is -- we're working on key word
relevance for AdMob. But right now, you have

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:14.550
-- your options are -- a lot of our targeting,
our ads targeting, is going to be through

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:19.460
the device -- like I -- when I showed you
the House ads creation, is through device

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.980
or Geo.
We're working on piping through the key words

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:32.640
into AdSense. So you actually get AdSense
ads through AdMob. So if -- there's a key

00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.550
word section in the SDK. And you can come
to office hours and we will show you how to

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:40.740
implement it if you don't know or you haven't
figured that out yet. But that's going to

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:49.570
be the best way to drive relevant ads into
your application.

00:36:49.570 --> 00:36:57.560
Any other questions? No?
Okay. That's it. Thanks, everybody, for coming.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:57.890
