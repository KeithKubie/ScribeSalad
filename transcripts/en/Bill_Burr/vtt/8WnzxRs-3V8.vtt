00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:04.910
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:04.911 --> 00:00:08.250
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.630
I'm checking in on you.
I'm just checking in on you.

4
00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:13.970
I really need to check in on you.
At least half of you.

5
00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.560
A little less than half old g shoes.
Make sure you guys are right.

6
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.450
There's a lot of crying going on out there.

7
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.260
<v 1>Okay?</v>

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:24.580
<v 0>Jesus fucking Christ.</v>

9
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.760
I've never seen so many fucking adults crying in my life.

10
00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:36.550
What is with all the fucking crying?
I get it.
Your person didn't win,

11
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:41.290
but Jesus Christ,
you're making the left look horrible.

12
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.390
Going to Canada.
I love this shit where people like threatening like share,

13
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.730
share goes.
If Trump wins,
I'm going to go to Canada.
It's like,
who gives a fuck?

14
00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.730
You know?
I didn't even know you was still here.

15
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.093
<v 1>Here.</v>

16
00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.290
<v 0>Look,
I'm not saying I'm happy.
I wasn't happy with either one of these people.</v>

17
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:02.680
All right.
Yeah.
Um,

18
00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:07.830
but the level of fucking arrogance of celebrities during all of this shit was

19
00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:12.280
just,
it's such a,
a whole other level.

20
00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.960
Do you realize how fucking arrogant you are that you're making this to you?

21
00:01:16.961 --> 00:01:20.800
Basically,
you're threatening that if your candidate doesn't get in,

22
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.180
your going to leave the country and your ego is so fucking big.

23
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:28.870
You think somebody going like,
well,
I want to vote for Trump,

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.180
but if he gets elected,
we lose share.

25
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.560
I got you.
Beat the Fuck Outta here.

26
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.891
Heard Barbra Streisand.
Really?

27
00:01:43.891 --> 00:01:46.740
You're going to leave fucking Malibu to go live in Manitoba?

28
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.350
Railey you fucking

29
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.261
go ahead and do it.

30
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:58.490
I'll give you 40 bucks for your house that only get yet that 9,000 fucking acres

31
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:02.710
up there.
Go ahead.
Go,
go,
move up to yellow knife.
The dumbest shit.

32
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.670
But I literally think like that's the level of ego that you have to have as like

33
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:14.230
an actor or a comedian or something like that.
Literally too.
I mean,
I know,

34
00:02:14.231 --> 00:02:16.990
I guess I talk about it,
but you know,
I fuck around.
I trashed replied.

35
00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:20.270
Now I told you guys who to vote for or whatever.
I just trashed.

36
00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.940
And both I tried to evenly,

37
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.980
but that fucking level that people take it to where they just start,
uh,
you know,

38
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.310
I kind of was on,
I was on Conan last night,
which was really difficult show,
uh,

39
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.140
to do last night because,
uh,
you know,
you know,

40
00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.570
people I like fucking stunned out here.
They can,
they can't believe it,
um,
as,

41
00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:43.060
I can't believe it in San Francisco,
Berkeley,

42
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.600
fucking New York City and all that type of shit.
Um,

43
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.550
so it was kind of weird.
It was like going on like right after a funeral.

44
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.560
I felt so.
Um,
but,
uh,
I really think this is just my own opinion.

45
00:02:56.561 --> 00:02:57.010
What do you guys,

46
00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.570
what do you guys think about celebrities endorsing a,

47
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.460
uh,
a candidate?
Because I think the candidates,

48
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:10.740
they also kind of reach out to people a little bit.
Like I like,
I,

49
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.220
I've never understood that.
Like,
why would I be like,
you know,

50
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:16.090
who are some of the people,
you know,

51
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:17.810
some of the fucking people that have done it,
like I just,

52
00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:21.610
I just don't understand.
It's,
Oh,
you know I was going to vote this way,

53
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.010
but the guy from my three kings told me to do,
Oh,

54
00:03:25.011 --> 00:03:27.280
the other movie where he tries to get the sky miles.

55
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:30.640
The Guy who did the movie about this guy getting the sky miles is telling me

56
00:03:30.641 --> 00:03:33.880
this should be the person to lead the free world.

57
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:38.290
You know,
I got a lot of feelings on our gun control,

58
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.320
but let me check in with Sean Penn first.
See what he has to say.

59
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.380
The level of fucking arrogance

60
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.030
<v 2>that you have to have.
I don't know.
It's a fine line cause it's like,
all right,</v>

61
00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:55.540
well it's good that they're involved politically,
but like you know,

62
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:58.630
there's a lot that once you're famous then they're actually going to put a

63
00:03:58.631 --> 00:04:00.430
camera on you and then you're going to start talking.
You know,

64
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:04.220
it's the same thing.
It's when you become a huge fan of your t,

65
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.220
you're a big fan of your team,
right.

66
00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.080
<v 0>And you know,
you're always sitting down,</v>

67
00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.070
<v 2>but the nose bleeds and then all of a sudden you get a part on a Sitcom and then</v>

68
00:04:13.071 --> 00:04:15.650
they got you sitting down there and then your team's doing well.

69
00:04:15.651 --> 00:04:19.790
And next thing you know,
the stick and the microphone in the face of an actor,

70
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.640
right.
To be or not to be a,

71
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.240
what do you think buffalo has to do here in the second half?
Well,

72
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.920
I thought I'd like to see you out of your checking down a little bit.
It's like,

73
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.700
<v 0>I don't know.
I don't understand.
I'm pain.
I'm it.
You know what?</v>

74
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:36.190
In defense of celebrities,

75
00:04:36.191 --> 00:04:40.210
regular people do the same thing on the news and they get away with it.

76
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.830
Cause you don't know what their names are.
You see it all the time on these,

77
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.290
uh,
you know,
when you watch the news,
if he ever watched the news,
they always go,

78
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.350
yeah,

79
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.910
<v 2>we went out on the street to ask people what they thought about this new target</v>

80
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:58.470
that's going up.
I think it's going to take away jobs.
Eh,
you know,

81
00:04:58.471 --> 00:05:01.870
I just think that downtown area,
we don't need that.
There's always that fun

82
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.330
<v 0>person,
right?
So maybe that's what it is.</v>

83
00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:09.050
That's that person is no different than any of those other people.
It's just,

84
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.670
I don't know.
I think once you get to a certain level,
you,

85
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.240
you kinda need to gracefully shut the fuck up.

86
00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.150
<v 2>All right.
Having said that,
Kim's,</v>

87
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.160
anybody explain to me why they're making such a big deal about the transition of

88
00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:28.220
power here is far as,
you know,

89
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.660
we hope that it's going to be graceful and we hope that it's going to be the,

90
00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:36.890
when Obama came in,
George Bush was very graceful,
gracious.

91
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.150
He was very blood.
They all,
they all were by entire life.
I've never,
you know,

92
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:45.490
Reagan did knock on the White House door and Jimmy was just like,
Hey,

93
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.530
get the fuck out.
And we don't want any,

94
00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.930
<v 0>there's literally camera's on.
That's another thing too.</v>

95
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.850
There's cameras filming you as this transition happens.

96
00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:00.650
Everybody,
everybody's always,
you know,
you're going to be grace gracious.

97
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.080
They know where you live.
You know,
they don't like each other.
You know,

98
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:10.010
this one's gonna be particularly fucking weird,
you know,

99
00:06:10.011 --> 00:06:15.011
considering the sizable overtly racist individuals that,

100
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.990
you know,
I don't know what the fuck they were here,

101
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:26.540
but they gravitated towards Trump.
So considering,

102
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:31.130
you know,
Barack being the first black president to now let this guy into,

103
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.300
I dunno,
according to people I hear,
I don't,
I don't,

104
00:06:34.301 --> 00:06:36.730
I mean fucking looked it up was endorsed by the clan.

105
00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:43.310
This was just fucking nuts.
Well that's it.
That was the end.

106
00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:47.300
It's the end and now it's over and now everybody can fucking move on.

107
00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.980
And um,
you know,
I got,

108
00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.480
I did call last night,
I think a,
I think it went as well as it could have gone.

109
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.290
And then of course,
you know,
I get people giving me shit.
You know,

110
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.150
I was trying to say,
look,
whoever's president,

111
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:04.580
it's not really going to affect my fucking day to day.

112
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.400
And then of course [inaudible] you fucking white guy.
But with Ebay they,
it,

113
00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:12.740
it's like,
yeah,
I get it,
I get it,
I get it.
But your day to day,

114
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:16.850
your day to day,
this is my,
and this is supposed to be uplifting by the way.

115
00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.180
All right.
Knowing full well that the world isn't fair.
Okay.

116
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.590
And that some people start way closer to the finish line than others.

117
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.780
That's just how it is.
All right.

118
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:33.560
And there's advantages and disadvantages to that.
You know,

119
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:36.410
if you got to run further,
you always think that other guy.
Yeah,

120
00:07:36.411 --> 00:07:37.790
he's fucking Angel's wings.
All,

121
00:07:37.791 --> 00:07:41.240
all he's gotta do is just fucking go fright from there to there.
Right?

122
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.930
And you see all these fucking rich kids that got drug fucking problems because

123
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.100
they have no worries in life.

124
00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.930
They're fucking red alerts and all that type of shit.

125
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:51.920
Everybody wants to think if you filthy stinking fucking rich that you just skip

126
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.530
around you,
life is fucking awesome.
Um,

127
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.730
I've done enough corporate gigs to see that there's not a lot of happiness over

128
00:07:58.731 --> 00:07:59.564
there.

129
00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:06.620
They're fucking with really rich people.
I gotta tell you out in Malibu,
you know,

130
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.470
Neil always wants to go out to Malibu.
She loves the fucking beach.

131
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:14.120
And we go out there and his fucking,
you know,
the seaside restaurants and shit.

132
00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:16.640
You know,
what's your cool,
it's great.
You fucking watch people surfing.

133
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:17.470
It's awesome.
You go out,

134
00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.640
you have a couple of crab legs and then you get the fuck out of there.

135
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:24.380
But there's a mall over there.
All right,
the Malibu Mall,
whatever the fuck.

136
00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:26.690
He go over there and I'm just telling you,
the people over there,

137
00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:30.290
I cannot put my finger on it.
They are fucking weird,

138
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:34.940
really rich people.
There's,
there's some sort of fucking disconnect.

139
00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:39.530
I don't know what's going on with them.
They just there,
I sent it to me.
I go,

140
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:42.620
what,
what is,
what the fuck is what these people,
there's no vibe.

141
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:47.180
There's no laughing,
what's going on?
And she just,
she goes,

142
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:51.810
the board.
That's what it is.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

143
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:55.220
I did gigs.
Um,
um,

144
00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.070
<v 1>yeah,</v>

145
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.860
<v 0>way back in the day I did some gigs out on the Hamptons,</v>

146
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:03.750
another place with like super rich people and they just fucking weird.

147
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:06.000
They'd sit there and they all look at each other.

148
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.990
They're looking you up and down.

149
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:09.120
Like I showed up and immediately they were just like,
all right,

150
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.880
this guy's in here for the day is a day tripper.

151
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:16.830
Should look at his fucking sneakers.
Yeah,
we'll get his fucking orange Afro.

152
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:20.940
Nobody has red hair and makes it in this world before they met Donald Trump on

153
00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.210
the fuck.
Did he go from a Brunette to fucking looking like me in seventh grade?

154
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:29.100
I don't understand it.
Um,
anyways,
but yeah,

155
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:32.160
you make your own fucking opportunity and I think,
uh,

156
00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:33.963
<v 1>okay.</v>

157
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.820
<v 0>You know,
is is depressing.
Is that,
is it,
I always looked at that like a,</v>

158
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.880
I dunno,
I always try to see like,
what the fuck I can do.
Um,

159
00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.570
I just can't believe that all the names that I'm hearing now,
if Jesus Christ,

160
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.920
Newt Gingrich,
Rudy Giuliani,
these fucking guys are coming back.

161
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:53.781
Jesus Christ,

162
00:09:53.781 --> 00:09:57.470
that's like that Stallone movie where he took all the fucking action heroes from

163
00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:01.490
back in the day,
Seagal and they all got to be level one last fucking thing.

164
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:06.290
Unless it's ahead,
then we'll make like three of them.
What was that called?

165
00:10:06.291 --> 00:10:07.124
The fucking

166
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:13.540
last gladiator erection hero to fucking,
I dunno.

167
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:16.970
Drink your juice in the hood.
I what the fuck with the expendables?
Yeah.

168
00:10:16.971 --> 00:10:19.820
This is like,
he's bringing back,
this is like the Republican expendables.

169
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.130
He's bringing all these guys back trying to think of another classic name he's

170
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:29.570
got to go for from way back in the day.
Somebody didn't die,

171
00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:32.780
I dunno,
whatever.
But she knows something.
It's over.

172
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.520
Get on with your fucking lives.
And uh,
you know,

173
00:10:38.610 --> 00:10:38.730
<v 1>yeah.</v>

174
00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:42.030
<v 0>There's all these protests at colleges.
I don't know what they're protesting.</v>

175
00:10:42.031 --> 00:10:44.220
I don't quite get it.
It's like there was an election.

176
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:48.600
It was legal and your person lost.
Um,

177
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.660
I guess they're just voicing their displeasure with the fact that this guy's in

178
00:10:51.661 --> 00:10:52.290
there.
I,
dude,

179
00:10:52.290 --> 00:10:57.260
I cannot fucking believe that the host of the apprentice is now president of the

180
00:10:57.261 --> 00:11:00.030
United States,
and that people are this excited and hopeful.

181
00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.560
Half the country is excited and hopeful.
You know what I mean?

182
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.583
<v 1>Okay.</v>

183
00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:09.000
<v 2>You know,
the,
the most amazing thing ever,</v>

184
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.100
our broke ass people that are Republicans,

185
00:11:11.101 --> 00:11:14.820
that's the most amazing fucking thing on the planet.

186
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:18.770
So you guys in guys,
he's gonna make it great again for you.

187
00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:22.590
All right?
Please keep checking in on me throughout the years.

188
00:11:22.591 --> 00:11:27.210
I want to know how your life individually will become great again.

189
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:31.410
Oh,
this country will become great again.
So then your life will be great again.

190
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.370
All those fucking people who are galloping sideways.
Um,

191
00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:37.460
<v 1>okay.</v>

192
00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:39.860
<v 2>I love how he wants to fuck it.
He doesn't want to have healthcare,</v>

193
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.540
but he wants to build a fucking wall from California,
New Mexico.

194
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.690
Oh,
how much money is that?
Gonna fucking cost Uber.

195
00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:50.210
The job that's going to create you the fuck out of here.
That's a,

196
00:11:50.211 --> 00:11:53.860
that's a government job.
Do you know,
bet all of these.
Fuck me.
You know something?

197
00:11:53.861 --> 00:11:54.070
That's

198
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.030
<v 0>one thing that they'll never police,
but that fucking bullshit.</v>

199
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.350
Where these contractors,

200
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:03.790
they get these government jobs to build shit and they charge 10 times the amount

201
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:04.624
that they should,

202
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.040
and these politicians just throw the fucking money around and they don't give a

203
00:12:09.041 --> 00:12:13.030
fuck,
or they have to do it.
Whatever the deal is.
You know,

204
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.850
like the math on this whole thing.

205
00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:20.851
Do you realize like $7 billion was spent to get somebody a job that pays 500

206
00:12:22.501 --> 00:12:27.010
grand a fucking year?
You know why?
Cause I bet it was,

207
00:12:27.011 --> 00:12:30.640
I bet it was a bunch of people that build forms,
you know,
foundations and shit.

208
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.080
That's what,
you know,
they were like,
oh man,
I gotta get that.
I it,

209
00:12:34.110 --> 00:12:37.150
I got to build the wall,
man.
You know,

210
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.280
some go with the fucking rusted out pickup truck
do to fight,

211
00:12:42.281 --> 00:12:46.630
get that fucking job.
All our problems are going to be over.

212
00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.650
I'll be building that for the rest of my life.
Um,

213
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.290
what a fucking crazy God damn time.
You know,

214
00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.310
everybody wondering how the fuck this happen.
I think you know what it is,

215
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:04.340
is people are still digging out of what happened in 2008 and it would've been

216
00:13:04.341 --> 00:13:07.970
nice if one of these fucking pussy politicians would have said something about

217
00:13:07.971 --> 00:13:12.770
the fucking bankers,
you know?
Um,
I dunno,

218
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.440
we will see what happens,
but uh,

219
00:13:17.450 --> 00:13:20.420
yeah,
boy.
Oh boy.
I'll tell you.
You know,
it was great though,

220
00:13:20.421 --> 00:13:23.030
was when I went to go to the elect to vote,
I fucking had,

221
00:13:23.060 --> 00:13:27.380
I look through all the fucking,
uh,
propositions,
everything.
I had all my,

222
00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.570
filled it all out,
like a fucking old lady.

223
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:34.510
And I went in there and I was just like,
Bang,
Bang,
boom,
boom,
boom.
I,

224
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.450
I blew through the whole thing,
knew exactly what I wanted to vote for.

225
00:13:38.451 --> 00:13:41.840
Actually felt a mildly informed this time.

226
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.900
Um,
so
he just showed up in his own fucking,

227
00:13:48.350 --> 00:13:53.010
this guy's a gangster.
I'm literally,
we shall see.

228
00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:56.840
You know what's funny is my wife had on a MSNBC,
by the way,

229
00:13:56.841 --> 00:13:59.720
you know what I was doing during the election where I just kept flipping back

230
00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:02.960
and forth to like,
uh,
who,
if whoever was losing,

231
00:14:03.470 --> 00:14:08.390
I would start watching them.
I would put on like CNN,
you know,

232
00:14:08.391 --> 00:14:12.050
I put that on Fox at first in the beginning.

233
00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:17.150
And once they started looking like they were winning and they were surprised and

234
00:14:17.151 --> 00:14:18.710
I went over to a,

235
00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.770
the CNN thing and then I went down to the comedy store and uh,

236
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.370
did Doug Stan hopes live podcast.
And,
uh,
I,

237
00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.910
that was the most amazing election I've ever fucking seen.
That it was like,

238
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:37.040
it was riveting for hours.
It never got boring.
Um,

239
00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:42.830
and as much as I don't like Trump,
I didn't like Hillary either.
Uh,
I have to say,

240
00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.190
watching people crying,
um,

241
00:14:48.550 --> 00:14:50.260
uh,
white people,
I want to say white people.

242
00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:53.000
If I see somebody of crying on my gut,
Jesus,
this is brutal,

243
00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.090
but just somebody white crying,

244
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.440
like I'm still white America.
Um,

245
00:15:00.441 --> 00:15:02.180
there was just something funny about that to me,

246
00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.610
like people hugging and stuff.
Um,

247
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:12.530
blew my mind,
blew my mind.
How many people just still look at Hillary Clinton.

248
00:15:12.531 --> 00:15:16.130
Like she's not a complete dishonest piece of shit and like the best I could get

249
00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:20.060
anybody to say.
It's like,
yeah,
but they're all like that.
Um,

250
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.950
all right.
Are you guys done amp done enough of this shit?
All right,

251
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:28.580
let's watch the gracious,
the Obamas,
they,

252
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.850
where they shook hands,
they were very gracious.

253
00:15:31.851 --> 00:15:35.090
And this is what makes the United States,
the United States,
this,

254
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.920
this peaceful passing of power.
Or this is what makes the Americas,

255
00:15:39.921 --> 00:15:42.840
the United States of America,
those of,
well,

256
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:48.380
I don't know why this is like such a,
an amazing fucking thing.

257
00:15:48.381 --> 00:15:53.381
This is just like just a different head that's owned by the same what fucking 20

258
00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:57.710
corporations out pill with your hacky conspiracy theory,
but isn't it?

259
00:15:57.770 --> 00:16:02.660
Isn't that what it is?
Well,
isn't it?
Um,
anyways,

260
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.370
let's move on everybody.

261
00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.930
Let's move on to a little bit of bread and circus there.
Um,

262
00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:14.720
so this,
guess what just went on sale?
Everybody,
um,
as of yesterday,

263
00:16:14.721 --> 00:16:18.520
promoted it on,
on the Conan show,
uh,
Conan O'brien's show,
um,

264
00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.050
the fifth annual Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit as always at the New York City

265
00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:29.000
Center.
Uh,
tickets are already on sale once we pay for the house.

266
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:34.160
All the money goes to his,
uh,
his mother and his family.
And,
um,

267
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.190
it's been such a great event that we do every year and um,

268
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.090
and has had an amazing effect on,
uh,

269
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:48.500
on people's lives that he loved.
It's been a great thing.
And,
um,

270
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.160
as I've said year after year,
the reason why we do whatever years,

271
00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:53.390
cause I always hate when somebody,

272
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:58.870
somebody passes and it's just like you do like that one fucking benefit.

273
00:16:58.911 --> 00:17:00.290
Like okay,
here's a sack.

274
00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.790
Aleut I hope this will last you for the next 60 fucking years.
Um,

275
00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.240
we all know Patrice so much that we all decided that we were going to do it

276
00:17:08.241 --> 00:17:12.020
every year and um,
make sure that uh,

277
00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.320
we continued to take care of the people that he was taken care of and the people

278
00:17:15.321 --> 00:17:19.100
that he loved.
So,
um,
it is,
it is a great cause.

279
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.580
It is 100% honest.
It's something you can get behind.

280
00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:27.020
None of the comedians are going to be dressed in pink,
none of that shit.

281
00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:31.940
You know,
it'll be a,
it'll be a great thing.
And um,

282
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:36.260
I'm also doing a,
the comp come home benefit with Denis Leary,

283
00:17:36.261 --> 00:17:41.150
Cam Neely,
uh,
this weekend and um,
oh Jesus.

284
00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:45.890
Oh Jesus did fucking Billy red faced by some cigars.
Holy fucking shit.

285
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.160
I've never smoked these before,
but um,

286
00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.280
I'm not going to tell you where I got them.
Let's see.

287
00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:54.720
Let me take a picture of him here.

288
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:58.820
I actually left him down in the fucking humor door there,
dude.

289
00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.610
Why is this fucking phone so difficult with me?
Um,

290
00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.170
a reality TV show start people with an orange toupee is now going to be the

291
00:18:08.171 --> 00:18:09.370
leader of the free world.

292
00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:12.820
That's what you did then half of the country feels good about us.

293
00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:15.620
I can't fucking believe it.

294
00:18:18.820 --> 00:18:23.060
Oh Jesus.
You know what it is?
It's just none of it is really that funny.

295
00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:25.540
It's just not funny.
The whole thing was just fun.

296
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.880
How to fuck a on the right and the left people,

297
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.450
how to fuck did we end up with those two?
How did that happen?

298
00:18:32.451 --> 00:18:37.190
I just kept thinking back,
but like all the fucking candidates just stunk.

299
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:43.420
God,
they stunk.
That QT pioneer camel hair coat.
The fuck is she doing now?

300
00:18:43.430 --> 00:18:47.420
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry,
I got on Msnbc here.

301
00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.450
Where the hell's that goddamn camera here.
All right,
there it is.
There it is.

302
00:18:52.451 --> 00:18:57.400
Okay.
It's Ah,
fuck.
It's a blurry goddamn picture on more old

303
00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:03.650
Hoyle Dell.
Oh fuck.
I can't read it.

304
00:19:03.651 --> 00:19:07.490
I took a blurry picture of it,
then I thought if I,
if I zoomed in,

305
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.290
it would somehow get better.
Um,
wait,
wait,
wait,

306
00:19:12.291 --> 00:19:17.290
wait,
wait.
Sorry.
Sorry again.

307
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:23.710
The fuck is it?
Oh,
there it is.
Okay.
Julio,
Yo de Monterrey,

308
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.920
not
Monterri Siri,

309
00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:32.300
La Hoya and apologies to anybody Latino.

310
00:19:32.301 --> 00:19:36.110
Listen to this 56 ring gauge.
It's like a fucking two hours smoke.

311
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:40.790
I got a fucking box of those goddamn things and bringing it to comics,

312
00:19:40.791 --> 00:19:44.750
come home and I'm hoping,
uh,
there's gonna be some cigar smokers there.

313
00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:50.090
Um,
oh,
it's going to be such a great event.
Going to be a great event.
So anyways,

314
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:52.310
I have not been paying attention to shit,

315
00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.150
but editing my new fucking special and a,

316
00:19:56.151 --> 00:19:59.360
I'm probably gonna add another fucking standup date while I'm out here is I'm

317
00:19:59.361 --> 00:20:01.790
waiting for my kitchen to get done,
which still is not done.

318
00:20:01.791 --> 00:20:03.740
It was supposed to be done by now,
but then,
you know,

319
00:20:03.741 --> 00:20:08.420
we ran into the cloth wiring,
so,
uh,
you know,

320
00:20:08.421 --> 00:20:11.120
and then the place we were staying at the haunted fucking house,

321
00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:16.170
the person who owned it came back.
So now we're,
we're in a hotel and,
uh,

322
00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:20.210
has a little kitchen,
right?
So I keep saying the Nia,
you know,

323
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:24.410
it's fucking hilarious.
It has this little kitchen and has pots and pans,

324
00:20:24.411 --> 00:20:28.550
but it has no spatula,
had nothing that you could fucking cook with.

325
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.300
It's hilarious.
They just had like the,
the pants and,
um,

326
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.420
so I was like,
oh,
I see that fucking game plan.

327
00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.450
They gonna act like there's a kitchen and then I got to give me any fucking
shit.

328
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.360
You know,
they're gonna have a couple of props.

329
00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:43.430
Is looks like a Goddamn like sitcoms kitchen.

330
00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.700
They've got a couple of glasses up front and then there's like nothing else.

331
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:51.070
Even like the cereal bowls I like so fucking shallow.
It's like a,

332
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.980
it's like a deep plate,
you know,
you pour a little bit of milk in.

333
00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:55.360
It's already going over the sides.

334
00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.900
So I drove back to my house and got all my fucking tongs and spatulas and all

335
00:21:00.911 --> 00:21:04.330
that type of ship and I'm,
now I'm viewing it like,
um,

336
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.940
I'm going to try to beat them at their own game.
Right.

337
00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.860
Cause you don't stay in hotels fucking expensive,
right.

338
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.370
So Nia keeps filling an order.
God Damn Room Service.
And I keep saying to,

339
00:21:12.371 --> 00:21:17.350
I was like,
Nia,
every time we eat in the kitchen,
all right,

340
00:21:17.351 --> 00:21:21.760
the terrorist's loose.
Okay.
This,
this is a victory for us.
I fucking,
I haven't,

341
00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:24.640
I have not enjoyed food the way I have.

342
00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:28.300
When you are in a fucking hotel and you actually buy food,
you know,

343
00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.620
and start cooking up a mate eggs the other day,
right?
Simple Shit.

344
00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:36.850
Just filling myself up.
I still got that fucking elk that Rogan gave me.

345
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.870
You know,
I made a little American shops,
so we with that shit.
And um,

346
00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.000
I don't know.
My wife,
she's telling me,
right,
let's go downstairs.

347
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:48.820
I'll meet you downstairs.
You know,
they just love,

348
00:21:48.821 --> 00:21:53.080
like women are hilarious.
They just loved that whole,
the whole scene,
right?

349
00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:58.740
Oh you got like a fountain down there and you said in a sunny area,

350
00:21:58.910 --> 00:22:02.830
they have like a little tent is nice.

351
00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.850
Why don't you want to come to town?
They just wear you down.

352
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.280
You just like quiz.
It's like fucking nine zillion dollars for fucking eggs.

353
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:18.460
I know,
but it's nice.
Like fuck.
All right,

354
00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:24.100
fine.
All right,
here we go.
The NHL,
this was out trying to get to,

355
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:28.930
we got the Columbus blue jackets.
You'll be,
uh,
the Boston Bruins.

356
00:22:28.931 --> 00:22:32.020
Maybe I can finally watch your fucking game.
You know,

357
00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:35.140
maybe like the fucking NHL network here.
Something.

358
00:22:37.490 --> 00:22:39.470
I don't fucking know.
I don't even know what the fuck's on our team.

359
00:22:39.471 --> 00:22:42.500
All I know is our first line as far as I remember was

360
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:45.380
Marshawn Bergie and a pasta not going.

361
00:22:45.381 --> 00:22:50.330
I don't know what the fuck else is on the thing.
Bruins forwards d more.
No idea.

362
00:22:50.331 --> 00:22:55.330
Patrice Bergeron
back as we had last year.
David Craigy,

363
00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.730
Brad Marshawn Volesky is back.
Nash.
I don't know who the fuck that is.
Jimmy,

364
00:23:03.410 --> 00:23:07.610
Jimmy Hayes.
Ryan's Boba tea Shaller no idea.

365
00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:12.690
Pastor knuck.
CISGENIC Zeigarnik.

366
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:13.583
No idea.

367
00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.343
<v 3>Okay.</v>

368
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.260
<v 0>And I don't know anybody else.
Somebody get</v>

369
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:24.010
Myla Ciara McQuade and I'm okay.
Both millers to crew.
Crew back.

370
00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:28.130
Both millers it back.
Cruise back.
Mcquade Shara.

371
00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:30.120
<v 3>Okay.</v>

372
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.250
<v 0>I don't know.
Do we never fucking recovered,
man?</v>

373
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.870
Whatever that fucking move was to free up all the salary cap money when we just

374
00:23:36.871 --> 00:23:41.430
basically imploded the team.
We're two years into this shit.
I don't know.

375
00:23:41.431 --> 00:23:43.060
It just seems like it's,
this is,

376
00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:45.920
it's the same as like last year as far like the level

377
00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:50.330
<v 2>that we're at,
where we're going to,
I don't know.
Joe Barton at said it best.</v>

378
00:23:50.331 --> 00:23:53.510
He goes,
you did the worst fucking thing you could do is you,
you,

379
00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.450
you missed the playoffs on the last day,

380
00:23:56.451 --> 00:23:59.330
so you lost all the playoff revenue and then you're going in.

381
00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.480
You're not going to be,
you didn't suck.
So you could be like fucking,

382
00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:08.030
you know,
Toronto and have a shot at someone like a

383
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:13.310
Austin Matthews,
you know,
whatever the fuck are you going to do.

384
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:17.900
As long as the Canadians don't win it,
I'm happy.
I'm a happy,
happy fucking guy.

385
00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:20.821
All right,

386
00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:23.150
let's read a little bit of advertising here and then I'm going to give you my

387
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:24.830
predictions for a Trump presidency.

388
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.620
What's going to change how he's going to make it great?

389
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.710
He's gonna make it great again.
All right.
A legacy box,
everybody.

390
00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:38.030
This is,
this is the greatest fuck in the world.

391
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:41.750
The legacy box.
No legacies like pass down,
right?

392
00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:46.250
He's a legacy.
All right.
What was the last time you watched home movies,

393
00:24:46.490 --> 00:24:47.323
your home movies.

394
00:24:47.390 --> 00:24:50.470
If you're like most Americans as a box in your closet of videotapes,

395
00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:54.380
film videos and photos that don't get watched and taken out worse,

396
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:56.090
they are actually deteriorating.

397
00:24:56.091 --> 00:25:00.560
Introducing legacy box as simple and affordable way to get your recorded moments

398
00:25:00.561 --> 00:25:04.550
digitally preserved on a DVD or thumb drive.
Here's how it works.

399
00:25:04.551 --> 00:25:06.950
Load legacy box with your old tapes,
films,

400
00:25:06.951 --> 00:25:11.060
pictures and auto audio recordings and send it back.

401
00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:15.080
You'll get them back in a couple of weeks on DVD or a convenient thumbdrive

402
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.600
ready to watch,
share and relive.
That's pretty cool.

403
00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:20.570
Just make sure if he did a personal porno,

404
00:25:20.571 --> 00:25:23.390
you don't accidentally send that legacy box.

405
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.690
Takes care of everything and provides updates at every step of the process.

406
00:25:26.691 --> 00:25:31.550
That's why over 250,000 families have used them.
The Huffington Post,
Booboo,

407
00:25:32.270 --> 00:25:36.410
parents magazine,
USA Today and the view are all talking about legacy box.

408
00:25:36.411 --> 00:25:39.980
Even Disney has trusted legacy box to digitize their media.

409
00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.020
And for a limited time,
go to legacy

410
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.760
box.com/bird to get 40% discount on your water.
That's legacy

411
00:25:48.650 --> 00:25:51.980
box.com/burr one more time.
Legacy box.com/bar

412
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:56.240
uh,
with everyone gathered for the holidays.

413
00:25:56.241 --> 00:26:00.860
Now is the perfect time to share all those old photos and cassettes and home

414
00:26:00.861 --> 00:26:02.750
videos.
Go to legs.
We got it.
Lazy

415
00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:09.050
box.com/bernie at 40% off you fucking discount on your legacy box that I

416
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:14.000
mentioned.
It's legacy box.
All right,
Joe Rogan's company.
Everybody Audit,

417

<v 2>Breaking News,
Trump and Obama meeting at the White House.</v>

461

Well,

talking,

462
00:29:01.451 --> 00:29:04.720

Shut the fuck.
I mean,
I got a lot of nerve telling people to shut up.

463
00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.143
<v 1>MMM.</v>

464

What is wrong with you guys?
Jesus Christ.

467
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:24.920
You pick the reality show TV star.
That's who the fuck you picked.

468
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:30.290
Then you picked George W.
Bush.
Hey Sharon critique here.
Can you give me a guy?

469
00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:35.220
You know,
this is what kills me about you.
Dumb fucks over there.

470
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:40.440
I I lean right a lot.
I lean left too.
Sometimes I'm liberal.

471
00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:42.190
Sometimes I'm,
but for fuck's

472
00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:45.910
<v 0>sakes,
can you get me a guy that could give a speech?</v>

473
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:50.920
You haven't done it since.
Herbert Walker Bush.
He gave a great speech.

474
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.530
I like that guy.
I had no fucking beat with that guy.

475
00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.820
Now I'm going to go from my shack or chicken.

476
00:29:55.821 --> 00:29:58.300
I could check for fucking eight years.
Right?

477
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.750
I didn't like everything that Obama did,
but she got it.
You have to admit,

478
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:06.760
even you fucking racist cops.
Got To admit that guy was phenomenal speaker.

479
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.280
Phenomenal speaker is fucking hilarious.

480
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:12.430
He wasn't an embarrassment to hear the world talking.

481
00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.920
Now we're going to have a fucking Trump,
Jesus Christ.

482
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:19.690
Oh,
it's unbelievable.

483
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.620
I've got a lot of nerve cause I actually liked Bernie Sanders watching that guy

484
00:30:23.621 --> 00:30:26.230
give his speech.
Jesus Christ.
It was like he was at a town meeting

485
00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.240
[inaudible] fucking hands flapping all over the place.

486
00:30:33.130 --> 00:30:37.180
You know what?
I don't know if there was,
there wasn't a right choice in this one.

487
00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:41.180
There really wasn't.
All right.
Now the,
the marines,

488
00:30:42.610 --> 00:30:45.220
well gonna most of the two best guys in the world.

489
00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:46.830
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

490
00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.560
<v 0>How do they think they've got to have now the,
how the fuck did they do that?</v>

491
00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:52.190
Where they face each other?
They pause for a second.

492
00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:54.993
<v 1>Right.</v>

493
00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.250
<v 0>And then they put the same time.
They both fucking,
ah,
they salute.</v>

494
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.720
You know what I mean?
It's like you have to listen to led Zeppelin and then they,

495
00:31:03.990 --> 00:31:07.980
they all just fucking the play in the play and then the song just stops and then

496
00:31:07.981 --> 00:31:11.010
they come back in again.
And sometimes it's on time.
Sometimes it isn't.

497
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.040
It's cause you know somebody just,
yeah,

498
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.900
it's a look that give somebody look and then boom,

499
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:18.990
you look at these fucking marines said they don't give each other.
We look.

500
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:22.110
They still brought their fucking hand up at the same time.

501
00:31:22.111 --> 00:31:23.810
There's gotta be some sort of,
some sort of marine,

502
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.800
a little wiggle with an eyebrow.

503
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:29.190
Granted we are like 40 yards away with the camera and then I'm sitting in a

504
00:31:29.191 --> 00:31:30.060
fucking hotel room.

505
00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.710
I wonder what the fucking audition was to get that Gig.

506
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.400
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

507
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.420
<v 0>You know,
how many fucking doors did you have to open?
Like perfectly to be there.</v>

508
00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.850
You know,
it's gotta be some proud mom out there.
That's my son.

509
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.790
He's going to open the door.

510
00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.710
What was the last time a president with the toupee
was president.

511
00:31:58.030 --> 00:32:02.980
They've all had full heads of hair.
All have full heads of hair.
Hey ladies,

512
00:32:02.981 --> 00:32:05.860
who's going to be the next lady president?
I mean the next,

513
00:32:05.861 --> 00:32:08.920
the first one I should say.
Do you think Hillary's done?

514
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:13.870
Do you think she has enough pants?
Suits for another run?
You know,

515
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.030
I dunno.

516
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.420
I just hope she goes to a chiropractor and gets her fucking neck fixed because I

517
00:32:19.510 --> 00:32:22.450
don't what she was like a baby,
you know?
I,
you fucking,
you know,

518
00:32:22.451 --> 00:32:27.250
babies can hold their heads up.
She kind of was fucking flopping all around.

519
00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:32.890
Um,
I love the pantsuit though.
You know what I mean?

520
00:32:32.891 --> 00:32:35.710
If I was a fucking check of a certain age,
you know what I mean?

521
00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:40.130
I had the kids already,
you know,
shut down

522
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.480
<v 2>the park,
if you know what I mean.
You know,
hot flashes are over,
right?</v>

523
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.350
Wally world's closed for renovations,
you know,

524
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.510
then you got to rock the fucking pants suit.

525
00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.050
You got to get the shorter fucking hair.
Like,
I don't give a shit anymore.

526
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:59.180
You know,
my husband's old.
What's he gonna do?
Ah,
he ain't going anywhere.

527
00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:00.680
And you go out,
right?

528
00:33:00.681 --> 00:33:03.880
You get the Ellen degeneres haircut and you go out and you get a fucking pants

529
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:07.880
suit walk around and some flatties for once in your life.

530
00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.950
You fucking concerned about your own comfort,
you know?
Ah,

531
00:33:12.951 --> 00:33:16.700
man.
You know what?
If I was Hillary,
my next fucking move is you're more,

532
00:33:16.701 --> 00:33:19.370
Johnny Carson had his own line of fucking sport coats.

533
00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.360
I would have my own line of fucking pants suits.
Right.

534
00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:25.190
But you get people like Rihanna,

535
00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.580
people in the prime of their fucking life that like walking around half naked

536
00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.640
and they somehow,
you know the sound out turn the pants suit.

537
00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:37.550
Who the fuck is is good looking enough in their twenties to make the fucking

538
00:33:37.551 --> 00:33:38.720
pants suit come back.

539
00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:40.713
<v 1>You know,</v>

540
00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.350
<v 2>I,
you know,
I don't mind the pantsuit when I was coming up the fucking,
you know,</v>

541
00:33:46.351 --> 00:33:49.260
Rhoda had them,
Mary Tyler Moore had them,
you know what I mean?

542
00:33:49.261 --> 00:33:50.220
And they will fucking young,

543
00:33:50.221 --> 00:33:53.230
broad say I was sitting there as a little fucking fire,

544
00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.880
bald fucking freckled jerk off.
And I would,

545
00:33:56.990 --> 00:34:00.570
I would watch all of those fucking Charlie's angels that they will use to wear

546
00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:03.060
them for Pfizer killed the fuck at pantsuit.

547
00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:07.320
But the parents do back then was sorta like the diversion of the John Travolta

548
00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.730
Su.
You know what I mean?

549
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:13.780
It was just a bunch of ray on and no condoms in the 70s and that's,

550
00:34:13.781 --> 00:34:15.400
that's how we ended up where we're at.

551
00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.250
That's why the fucking Rhodes is so god damn filled up.

552
00:34:20.410 --> 00:34:21.243
<v 1>MMM.</v>

553
00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:24.990
<v 2>Oh Jesus.
The sound down on em,
MSNBC right now.</v>

554
00:34:24.991 --> 00:34:26.940
Just looking at the looks on people's faces.

555
00:34:26.941 --> 00:34:30.120
I don't know why this shit is so funny to me because I am not thrilled with this

556
00:34:30.121 --> 00:34:34.680
guy being president.
But seeing people disappointed and crying on television,

557
00:34:34.980 --> 00:34:37.790
you know,
past,
obviously if somebody they love died or something like that,

558
00:34:37.791 --> 00:34:38.970
that I don't laugh at that shit.

559
00:34:38.971 --> 00:34:43.970
But like I told you guys are back in the day when the biggest loser was on and

560
00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:46.670
those fat people would just start crying about how they could stop eating

561
00:34:46.671 --> 00:34:48.830
hamburgers and shit.
It just fucking always,
I mean,

562
00:34:48.831 --> 00:34:51.230
I wanted them to lose weight and shit,
but there's just something,

563
00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:55.460
there's something fucking hilarious about people cry,

564
00:34:56.330 --> 00:35:00.470
adults crying.
I don't know why.
It's probably me being a walled off,

565
00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:05.780
you know,
I'm not actually,
I'm not that fucking walled up,
walled off.
Right.

566
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:10.160
I can get choked up with the best of them.
But if I did it,
you know,

567
00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:14.660
I expect people to laugh at me.
Um,

568
00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.050
this is when you know you have too much news coverage.

569
00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:22.700
I'm sitting here watching this marine opening and closing a door and these

570
00:35:22.701 --> 00:35:26.500
fucking nerd guys keep
from the press.

571
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:31.250
Keep walking in and out of the shot.
Look at this.

572
00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.211
There's a lady right now,

573
00:35:32.211 --> 00:35:36.110
she's backing up to take a picture with their cell phone of,

574
00:35:36.111 --> 00:35:40.620
I dunno what now the marines opening the door.
She walks out.

575
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.790
You really,
you know what?

576
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:45.090
There's actually great that she was in there just to see.

577
00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.573
<v 3>MMM.</v>

578
00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.600
<v 2>Who the fuck just walked out of the place?</v>

579
00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.590
What was that like?
His cousins or something.

580
00:35:58.810 --> 00:35:59.540
<v 3>Okay.</v>

581
00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.950
<v 2>That's such a weird gig.
Does that mean you're a good marine</v>

582
00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.220
but they make you like the fucking bellhop or the White House?

583
00:36:08.221 --> 00:36:09.540
I know at the end of the day,
I mean,

584
00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:13.350
you went through all of that fucking training.
You can snap somebody's neck,

585
00:36:13.351 --> 00:36:17.970
right?
Can fucking shoot somebody from 200 yards away and then yeah.

586
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.290
What's,
what should detail.

587
00:36:19.650 --> 00:36:22.230
You're going to open and close the back door at the White House.

588
00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:28.570
And then what?
Nah,
that's it.
You can be dressed in your formal,

589
00:36:28.571 --> 00:36:31.350
so you're going to have your whites on and you're just going to stand at fucking

590
00:36:31.351 --> 00:36:34.200
attention.
There's no way that anybody can do that.

591
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:38.220
It's gotta be like two hours shifts.
How long can you just stand there?

592
00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.760
That fucking straight.
Yeah,

593
00:36:41.761 --> 00:36:44.640
but he's also gotta be of some lunatic comes fucking running up this,

594
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:49.590
remember that guy jumped over the fucking fence and just ran up and he actually

595
00:36:49.591 --> 00:36:52.110
got into the fucking White House.
That was unbelievable.

596
00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:57.060
That's when I really realized like how not important the president was.
You know,

597
00:36:57.090 --> 00:37:00.180
once again,
they don't even lock the door.

598
00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:05.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

599
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:10.580
<v 2>Do you understand that fucking ass who jumped over that gate and ran up to the</v>

600
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:10.581
White House?

601
00:37:10.581 --> 00:37:13.680
Do you realize that that guy got further into the White House than he would've

602
00:37:13.850 --> 00:37:16.900
got into my house?
My door is locked.

603
00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:18.403
<v 1>Okay.</v>

604
00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:21.300
<v 2>Then he ran down the hall.</v>

605
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:25.470
He gave a head fake and he broke the ankles is some secret service guy.
Right?

606
00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.350
Like Iverson did the Jordan,
when he first came into the league and he went,

607
00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.930
he went to,
he got like
[inaudible] instead of zagged.

608
00:37:33.931 --> 00:37:36.720
And that was the only reason why he didn't just fucking get in there.

609
00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:41.460
It's really not funny,
but you know,
the fact that nothing happened,

610
00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.810
that's kind of fucking hilarious.
Um,

611
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:50.340
Jaisal go scan with this pea soup,
green fucking tie,

612
00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:55.720
just pointing and all that type of stuff.
He's fucking,
yeah.

613
00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:58.320
Geez.
Everybody thinks they're making a point,
including me.

nine.

probably that's the reason.

657
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:51.190
Most part,
we all have arms and legs of fucking head on top of the torso.

So there's,
you know,

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:25.100
These people I've never hung out with who are somehow my friends send me a few

702
00:43:25.101 --> 00:43:29.180
pairs a while back and now I can't imagine wearing anything else that is alike.

703
00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:32.240
I where I'm not even wearing them right now.
Okay.
But what they send me,

704
00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.650
we're comfortable except for the Greg losing glue gain is cut.
All right.

705
00:43:36.651 --> 00:43:41.450
Was riding up on my bulls.
Um,
it wasn't even that.

706
00:43:41.451 --> 00:43:43.850
I just,
I just,
I could not wear them in front of my wife.

707
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:46.340
She was just dying laughing at me as I was walking by.

708
00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:48.320
You know what he should've done,
you know,

709
00:43:48.321 --> 00:43:50.750
that fucking crazy things that Olympic swimmers do.

710
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:53.990
You know where they bend over and then they just start fucking moving their arms

711
00:43:53.991 --> 00:43:56.940
like propellers.
I'm going to do that next time.
Put It on my fucking,
uh,

712
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.240
my Greg Louganis one's right.

713
00:43:59.270 --> 00:44:02.790
I'm going to put on my swimming goggles when my wife is looking.

714
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.320
I'll put it on one of her fucking head wraps and I'm just going to come out and

715
00:44:06.321 --> 00:44:07.154
do that.

716

undies.com/bar.
All right?

733
00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:18.390
And that is the,
uh,
that is the Thursday afternoon podcast and a,

734
00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:22.410
and that is the election.
All right?
It is over.
This is the guy that we picked.

735
00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.990
And just because you know,
your person didn't win,

736
00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:28.460
it doesn't mean you got to yell at other people.
All right?
You know,

737
00:45:28.570 --> 00:45:31.770
it'd be great is everybody,
if everybody just sort of stop yelling at each other,

738
00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:36.330
okay.
You know,
maybe help each other out.
You know,

739
00:45:36.331 --> 00:45:40.140
somebody actually said to me,
you know,
um,
obamacare's going to go away.

740
00:45:40.141 --> 00:45:43.380
How to fuck am I going to pay for my meds?
And that immediately made me think,

741
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:48.210
wow,
you know what?
Why don't regular people just pick up the slack?
You know,

742
00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:49.890
I don't know how to fuck to do.

743
00:45:49.891 --> 00:45:53.130
It's what sets something up or maybe just help out one person.

744
00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.000
What if you're in the prime of your life or your earning power or whatever,

745
00:45:57.001 --> 00:46:01.020
you know,
and somebody down the street needs meds.
You know what?

746
00:46:01.021 --> 00:46:04.920
If you booze a couple of less times a fucking month and you hook them up with

747
00:46:04.921 --> 00:46:08.310
some money to get their meds,
you save you one

748
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.430
and then you won't be [inaudible] is bloated.

749
00:46:11.431 --> 00:46:12.870
You won't be drinking as much booze.

750
00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:17.280
Why don't just regular people help each other out instead of waiting for these

751
00:46:17.281 --> 00:46:20.340
fucking people to do it because they don't get along with each other.

752
00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:23.070
Like when Obama went into office,

753
00:46:23.071 --> 00:46:27.990
evidently all the Republicans on the first fucking day in the house,

754
00:46:27.991 --> 00:46:31.800
the Senate or whatever,
just basically said,
we're just going to disagree with,

755
00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:35.500
we're not going to pass anything that this guy says.
Um,

756
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:40.470
which is really fucking treasonous behavior,
I think.

757
00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:44.700
Not Saying you've got to pass everything the guy says you do.

758
00:46:44.701 --> 00:46:47.880
Have to keep them in check,
but to before it even comes down the pipe,
you saying,

759
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:52.560
we're not going to fucking work with this guy.
I don't know.
Um,
so,

760
00:46:52.561 --> 00:46:55.410
but you can't ever expect these assholes to ever get along.

761
00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.840
They act like a bunch of fucking babies.

762
00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:02.850
They really are a bunch of babies the way that they behave.
So,
uh,

763
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.020
but that doesn't mean you have to fucking behave like that.
You know,

764
00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:11.160
you could be a,
it can be that person who doesn't scream and yell.

765
00:47:11.810 --> 00:47:15.150
You can be that person that doesn't talk down to somebody because they don't

766
00:47:15.151 --> 00:47:16.110
live near an ocean.

767
00:47:16.530 --> 00:47:20.100
Or You could not judge somebody because they do live near the ocean for whatever

768
00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:22.350
fucking reason.
The blue states near the ocean,

769
00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.620
the other ones are fucking in the middle and everybody's screaming and yelling

770
00:47:25.621 --> 00:47:29.280
at each other.
I've gone to all 50 states and Goddammit,

771
00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:33.130
I've met great people out there.
I really have great food,
great fun.

772
00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:38.080
You know,
quit fucking yelling at everybody and now you gotta be all right.

773
00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:42.580
Trump's gonna be president for a lot of people.

774
00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.770
I guess it'll be a good thing for other people.

775
00:47:44.771 --> 00:47:47.350
It's not going to be a good thing,
but you know what,
you're not going to die.

776
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.210
Okay.
Get out in front of it.
Think something positive.

777
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.480
The end of the day,
if you want to get your business going,

778
00:47:55.481 --> 00:47:58.240
you're still going to have to do it.
Even if Obama was still in office,
I,

779
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.920
Hillary got,
they're a fucking newt Gingrich or Rudy Giuliani.
The end of the day,

780
00:48:02.921 --> 00:48:05.920
your life is on you and life is not fair.

781
00:48:06.130 --> 00:48:10.030
And people don't have the time to give a shit,
you know?

782
00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:13.330
And that's how it is.
It's unfortunate,
but that is how it is.

783
00:48:13.331 --> 00:48:17.890
But the second you fucking address that,
it's kind of empowering.
Right?
Oh fuck.

784
00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.540
I gotta handle this shit.
You know?

785
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.390
And this is coming from a privileged white male,
so

786
00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:25.960
<v 5>yeah.</v>

787
00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.410
<v 2>Oh,
go fuck yourselves.
All right.
That's the,
that's it.
Okay.</v>

788
00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:32.530
I'm just trying to say shit positive.
Yes.

789
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:34.463
<v 5>Oh,</v>

790
00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:39.460
<v 2>but it's all right.
Well then quit.
Quit moved to fucking Canada was sheriff.</v>

791
00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:43.420
See if anybody gives a fuck.
Um,
anyways.

792
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:48.070
Uh,
yeah,
it comes to music,
I guess is what happens now.

793
00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:52.690
And then we'll get to listen to some greatest hits before,
uh,

794
00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:58.570
the,
uh,
orange toupee guy was,
he made possible even running for president.

795
00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.150
Who knows?
Hey,
who do you think he,
you know,

796
00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:05.170
he should pick another reality TV show star for his fucking vice presidency.

797
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:08.740
You know,
he should get the guy from survivor,
you know,

798
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:12.200
who gets progressively angrier with every fucking season.

799
00:49:12.201 --> 00:49:14.410
I don't know if you guys have noticed that.
I don't understand.

800
00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:18.130
Like I stopped watching the ears ago because of it.
He just like,
you know,

801
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.000
red team

802
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.300
<v 5>falling behind.
They got to step it up.</v>

803
00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.230
<v 2>Just starts fucking yelling at him.
He used to just be,</v>

804
00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.750
they used to be more excited,
happy.

805
00:49:27.751 --> 00:49:31.050
I think he's just sick of being out on that island,
watching people eating bugs.

806
00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:33.450
I don't know what his issue was,

807
00:49:33.451 --> 00:49:36.450
but he seems to be taking it out on the people there in the islands,
you know,

808
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:39.690
and say waste away.
Alright,
I'm done.
Babbling.
All right.

809
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:44.060
<v 6>Uh,
you have a great weekend.
You're constantly does see on Monday</v>

810
00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:19.273
[inaudible]

811
00:50:25.430 --> 00:50:26.510
<v 2>hey,
what's going on?</v>

812
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:33.130
<v 7>Is the Monday morning podcast to what happened yesterday,</v>

813
00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:37.940
man,
I'll tell you.
Uh,
I was in,
uh,

814
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:42.650
what the hell was I?
Fort Collins,
Colorado.

815
00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:46.790
I was still forming a Colorado state university and I was going to do the

816
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.200
podcast from there,
but every time I went to call up I couldn't get service.

817
00:50:51.710 --> 00:50:52.670
So that's what happened.

818
00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:58.450
And right now I am in Indianapolis Cause I'm doing Bob and Tom Radio tomorrow

819
00:50:59.451 --> 00:51:03.430
morning to hide my Gig in Nashville.
All right,

820
00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:08.210
so I'm on the road this week.
In fact,

821
00:51:08.211 --> 00:51:12.020
earlier this week I heard that I heard a commercial,

822
00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:16.770
you know that Johnny Cash song where he's like,
I've been to Tupelo stuff stuff,

823
00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.830
Brett,
we're rattling off all these cities have been everywhere,
man.

824
00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:26.640
And I literally yelled,
I said,
shut the fuck up Johnny.
Sylvie,
Sylvie.

825
00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:27.773
All right.

826
00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.780
So have a lot of fucking people and not to mention the fucking cities he

827
00:51:32.781 --> 00:51:36.380
mentioned in that song aren't just a bunch of cities you wouldn't want to go to

828
00:51:36.381 --> 00:51:40.880
anyways.
Yeah.
I haven't been to any everywhere you fucking Redneck,

829
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:44.510
you should've said I've been to Paris,
London.
You know what I'm saying?

830
00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:49.310
Rome places people want to go,
not Tupelo,
Toledo,

831
00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.390
Charlestown.
Nobody gives a fuck.
And what did you do that Johnny?

832
00:51:54.110 --> 00:51:55.910
Maybe that's why you were so fucking angry.

833
00:51:56.170 --> 00:52:00.170
And that's why I'm so fucking angry because I'd been in those goddamn cities too

834
00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:02.150
when it's,
you know what I like about him?
Let's,

835
00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:06.260
let's turn it around here and make it a little more positive as I go on the 70

836
00:52:06.261 --> 00:52:10.370
east trying to figure out where the fuck up.
There we go.
There we go.

837
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:15.350
Um,
you know what I like about them is they're a,

838
00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:18.200
they don't have enough money to Redo that downtown areas.

839
00:52:18.201 --> 00:52:21.750
So you get to see what you know,
you know,

840
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:25.010
America used to look like,
like 50 years ago,

841
00:52:25.011 --> 00:52:26.570
and I'm not trying to be condescending here.

842
00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.470
I actually liked architecture was better,
you know,

843
00:52:30.471 --> 00:52:31.670
stuff was made out of brick.

844
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:36.460
Everything wasn't like a fucking cheesecake factory and an Applebee's.

845
00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:39.770
Every time that's happened to me in my life.
I've been on the road,
Hey,

846
00:52:39.771 --> 00:52:41.180
I'm good on the front desk.

847
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:45.050
Do you have any place where I can get something healthy to eat?
Um,

848
00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.190
we have an apple base
that's a solution.

849
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:54.220
He wants something Klc.
Um,
what's healthy?
Oh,

850
00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:58.700
you know what healthy is healthy is when they wrap the silverware in the Napkin.

851
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:03.080
That means you're eating healthy and you know where they do that.

852
00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.650
They do it at Applebee's.
They do what?
It's Shoney's.

853
00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:11.050
Shoney's.
I've never,
um,

854
00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:16.370
never eaten there and show me this certain recipe fucking restaurant.

855
00:53:16.371 --> 00:53:21.350
You just go by those chains and for me anyway,
let me not speak for you.

856
00:53:21.500 --> 00:53:24.770
I don't want to be arrogant here,
but for me anyways,
some certain restaurants,

857
00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:26.250
fast food chains,

858
00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:31.880
I literally just look at the sign and it gives me a stomachache and I can never

859
00:53:32.731 --> 00:53:36.060
eat there.
And Shoney's is one of them.

860
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:41.580
Steak and shake is another one of the two of them.
I don't know,

861
00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:45.270
maybe I'm combining them.
They have like this orange fucking sign that just,

862
00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:49.590
it just reminds me of what I'm going to feel like after I eat that shit food.

863
00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:52.560
But I'm not always right cause I gotta tell Ya,

864
00:53:53.070 --> 00:53:58.070
I avoided the waffle house like the plague for like a decade on the road.

865
00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:03.360
I would just see that yellow sign with those,

866
00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:07.560
just that regular typescript waffle house and it just,
you know,

867
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.930
you could just drive and buy it.

868
00:54:09.931 --> 00:54:12.720
You knew how sticky the fucking tables we're going to be,

869
00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:17.760
how toothless the waitress was going to be,
how many felonies,

870
00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:20.730
how many convicted felons we're going to be.
It's just,

871
00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.800
it just wasn't worth it to get fucking waffle.

872
00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.140
Not to mention I have a great recipe for Waffles,

873
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.630
but then you know what I did the rich bitch tour and the two guys I was on tour

874
00:54:33.631 --> 00:54:36.660
with on the Chappelle show one night to let's go to the waffle house.

875
00:54:37.530 --> 00:54:40.020
And I went in there and uh,
you know,
wasn't that bad,

876
00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.280
although I gotta admit that it's been so long since I'd been there.
Whatever.

877
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:47.180
They have their home fries smothered,
covered and all that stuff.
With,

878
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:52.140
it's fucking gross.
You know,
I don't like you.
I don't mind you.

879
00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:55.530
You're punching up the food a little bit or kicking it up a notch.

880
00:54:56.970 --> 00:55:00.780
Is that uh,
it's gonna say Harold Carmichael.

881
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:05.190
What the fuck did his name popped?
What's that guy's name?
Emilio.
Emilio Estevez.

882
00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:06.990
What's the name of that chef where he goes,
Bam.

883
00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:12.180
He throws the sugar and everybody goes fucking crazy.
Emilio.

884
00:55:12.900 --> 00:55:17.490
Elios
I think the cell phone is affecting my fucking memory.

885
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:21.300
What is his name?
Jesus Christ.

886
00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:28.530
Uh,
Emerald.
Yeah,
we'd go Emma.
Look gassy.
Fuck the worst.

887
00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:29.311
You know,

888
00:55:29.311 --> 00:55:34.080
I was trying to remember the name screech yesterday from saved by the bell

889
00:55:34.950 --> 00:55:38.010
because I was talking about,
uh,
people being able to sell tickets.

890
00:55:38.010 --> 00:55:42.000
I couldn't fucking remember his name.
I was like scratchy,
skippy,

891
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:45.300
Sebastian.
I knew it began with an s,

892
00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:50.610
some sort of harder continent afterwards.
Screech.

893
00:55:52.080 --> 00:55:56.850
Okay.
What would you do if you,
the parent of a child star,
you know,

894
00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.270
besides steal his money before he turned 18.
Well,
put the fuck would you do,

895
00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:03.890
especially if,
I mean,
I'll,

896
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:08.250
I'll give screeches parents a break.
Okay.

897
00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:13.020
But I gotta say from here on out,
if you put your kid into show business,

898
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.410
first of all,
you're fucked in the head.
All right?

899
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:19.890
You wanted to make it on some level.
All right?
And secondly,

900
00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:23.120
if the kid books to show and his character,

901
00:56:23.890 --> 00:56:27.610
his character's name is like 50 or you know,

902
00:56:27.611 --> 00:56:31.510
just something you would name a fucking ferret if the,

903
00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:34.780
if that's what his character's name is.
Yes.
Or uncle,

904
00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:38.350
you just know he's going to be a fuck up.
I,
why did I say Urkel?

905
00:56:38.351 --> 00:56:41.860
Cause he's not a fuck up.
But you know what I'm saying?
That point,

906
00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:46.320
you got to stick to that kid and drug counseling.
You know when,

907
00:56:46.321 --> 00:56:50.640
when he's still eight years old.
Oh my God.

908
00:56:50.641 --> 00:56:52.650
You know what tells me a great fucking show.

909
00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:54.750
<v 8>Okay,</v>

910
00:56:54.750 --> 00:56:58.800
<v 7>you could have a scared straight for a child stars.</v>

911
00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:04.050
What you do is you have whoever the next fucking Hannah Montana is,
right?

912
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:07.050
That's another one.
You fucking name rhymes.
You finished,

913
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.510
she can be on coke on her knees in the bathroom of the viper room within three

914
00:57:12.511 --> 00:57:16.020
years.
I'll wait a minute.
But her dad's Billy Ray Cyrus.

915
00:57:16.021 --> 00:57:20.700
So he knows he's been there.
He's been there baby.
Okay.

916
00:57:20.701 --> 00:57:25.200
You understand whether my eyes look and see the pain that is pain of,

917
00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:29.910
of having a mullet and singing a song called Achy breaky heart.

918
00:57:29.970 --> 00:57:33.030
I swear to God.
No,
it was not for five year olds.
No,
it wasn't.

919
00:57:33.031 --> 00:57:38.031
It was for adults who was for adults and they fucking loved it and they bought

920
00:57:38.311 --> 00:57:42.180
it.
And then one day they figured out it's stuffed and then they all acted locked

921
00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:45.870
than ever bought it and no one will ever come to my shows again.

922
00:57:46.050 --> 00:57:50.760
So I cut off a moat and I'm pregnant at your Mama and then we had you,

923
00:57:51.660 --> 00:57:56.660
well now it's your fucking turn to continue the legacy of horrific fucking

924
00:57:57.121 --> 00:58:00.770
moments in show business.
Um,

925
00:58:02.310 --> 00:58:04.470
oh.
So this is a show.
You basically have

926
00:58:06.490 --> 00:58:08.580
former child stars who've done drugs.

927
00:58:09.920 --> 00:58:14.290
That dude from the courtship of Eddie's father.
Uh,
yeah.

928
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:17.170
Do you have to do Michael Diamond?
No.
Michael diamond

929
00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:23.670
in the Beastie boys.
Dustin diamond.
Yeah.
Have him fucking in there.
Yeah.

930
00:58:23.671 --> 00:58:25.380
You know your random Brady bunch.

931
00:58:25.381 --> 00:58:29.190
But they never really did anything fucking fags.

932
00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:33.630
They never really did anything just other than linger around
God,

933
00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:36.000
what a boring cast the people,
um,
whatever.

934
00:58:36.001 --> 00:58:39.570
You just take a bunch of child stars who fucked up,
who haven't died yet,

935
00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:44.520
and then you bring them in there and you haven't just started screaming at

936
00:58:44.521 --> 00:58:47.610
whoever the next Urkel is to make sure he's not on drugs.

937
00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.780
And if I could somehow smooths it out,
I think I could,
uh,

938
00:58:51.781 --> 00:58:56.760
I could sell that show to VH one,
right.
Stick a former rapper in there,

939
00:58:56.761 --> 00:58:59.400
get some hoes and you've got to show.

940
00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:02.580
So you might be asking yourself built,
you know,

941
00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:04.680
you've been doing this podcast for quite a while.

942
00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.970
You've been driving for quite a while on shift your hotel yet.
Uh,
no,

943
00:59:08.971 --> 00:59:12.850
I am not because I'm,
I dunno,

944
00:59:13.330 --> 00:59:16.120
I didn't want to spend the night in Indianapolis even though I have to do radio

945
00:59:16.121 --> 00:59:18.110
tomorrow at six in the morning.
And I looked,
uh,

946
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.950
I saw that the Redwings are playing the fucking,
uh,

947
00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:26.690
Pittsburgh penguins up in Detroit,
the best two teams in the NHL last year.

948
00:59:26.691 --> 00:59:29.030
I take a fuck it,
I'll drive up the street.

949
00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.880
They can't be more than an hour and a half to Detroit belts.

950
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:36.530
Turns out it's three hours and I already had a fucking car,
so joke's on me.

951
00:59:36.531 --> 00:59:40.910
This better be a good fucking game.
Um,
but anyways,

952
00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:44.750
I'm driving along here so I don't have the questions.
I don't have to question.

953
00:59:44.751 --> 00:59:48.080
So all I can do,
it's just run my fucking mouth this week.

954
00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:51.650
What should I have done for nine minutes and 51 seconds.
What?

955
00:59:51.651 --> 00:59:55.140
That also includes the intro intro.

956
00:59:55.550 --> 01:00:00.350
I talk to that fucking machine every week.
Um,

957
01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:03.380
all right,
so this is that.
Hey,
there's a waffle house.

958
01:00:03.381 --> 01:00:05.990
Now I'm driving down the road and I'm trying to make the decision,

959
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:10.190
the decision that Americans have to make everyday in this country.

960
01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:13.910
How do I not become a fat?
Fuck,
I'm Italian.
It's very difficult.

961
01:00:13.911 --> 01:00:18.020
Now here it's very difficult.
Where can I eat at here?

962
01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:22.640
There's a place called Joe's as a throwback.
What is this place?

963
01:00:22.700 --> 01:00:26.660
Joe's Joe's crab shack.
Oh yeah.

964
01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.550
That's what I do when I go to the middle of the country.

965
01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:32.840
Let me order some seafood show that's fresh.
The fuck is wrong with you.

966
01:00:34.130 --> 01:00:38.240
I'll tell you,
you know we do in Indianapolis and he likes Sushi.
We love it.

967
01:00:39.350 --> 01:00:41.750
What do you have?
What kind of Sushi?
What do you have?
Trout Sushi.

968
01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:45.603
So sort of fresh.

969
01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:52.370
They have catfish fish Sushi out here.
Oh,
you guys just go down there.
We just,

970
01:00:52.371 --> 01:00:53.750
can we just pull it out of the Crick?

971
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:57.890
Why does every more on in my act have a southern accent?

972
01:00:57.891 --> 01:01:00.560
I really have to stop that.
I'll tell you why.

973
01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:02.360
Because every time you get outside of a major city,

974
01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:07.220
everybody fucking talks like that.
Everybody's got a little bit of a lazy,

975
01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.940
Lazy Way of speaking
that was awful.

976
01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:14.570
Apartments every fucking one looking the same,

977
01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.430
but it's right near a manmade lake.

978
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:20.600
I got to tell you one of the most depressing things ever for me.
Oh,
that's nice.

979
01:01:20.601 --> 01:01:24.920
We just merge down to two lanes.
Were there signs?

980
01:01:24.921 --> 01:01:26.780
Maybe if I wasn't doing the podcast,

981
01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.520
can you imagine if I actually caused one of those horrific highway accidents?

982
01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:36.000
You know,
like anybody used to watch that show chips.
Remember that?
Uh,

983
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:38.090
Erik Estrada,
Larry Wilcox,

984
01:01:38.530 --> 01:01:42.470
<v 9>bad bad jet jet jet is.</v>

985
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:44.263
It is

986
01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:48.840
<v 7>is that in driving down the street and the motorcycles and once you show they</v>

987
01:01:48.841 --> 01:01:51.990
would literally have a 20 to 30 car pile up,

988
01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:56.830
which in all my years of being on the road,
I have never fucking seen it.

989
01:01:56.860 --> 01:01:58.830
My favorite thing about those pileups right

990
01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:03.030
was they would last for like a good fucking,
I don't know,

991
01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.550
one minute on television,

992
01:02:05.551 --> 01:02:10.470
which basically in real life is like a five minute catastrophe and everything.

993
01:02:10.471 --> 01:02:14.700
When everything was all said and done,
there's like 25 cars upside down,

994
01:02:14.950 --> 01:02:15.650
twist it around.

995
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:19.830
It was always like an oil tanker and then there was always that guy.

996
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:22.200
The last guy would always,

997
01:02:22.201 --> 01:02:27.201
somehow he'd get air off of cars rather than just plowing into them.

998
01:02:27.301 --> 01:02:28.320
He just defined,

999
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:33.350
he would defy physics and he would somehow get air shoot up and over everybody

1000
01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.580
and if you listen to the audio,

1001
01:02:35.581 --> 01:02:38.190
for some reason the guy would still be hitting the gas.

1002
01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:43.060
He's literacy in the air and his car is still going [inaudible]

1003
01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.490
like he thinks he's going to make it over.

1004
01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:51.960
I never understood that even as a little boy,
little lad watching it.

1005
01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:57.540
And I look at my dad and I would say,
dad,
why did he do that?
And He'd be like,

1006
01:02:57.541 --> 01:03:00.600
shut the fuck up.
Just shut the fuck up.

1007
01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:06.450
And the cat's in the cradle and a seal of approval.
Silver Spoon.
There it is.

1008
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:10.320
I'm telling you,
I think the fucking cell phone is affecting my memory.
So anyway,

1009
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:14.100
let's talk conspiracy theories.
Hey everybody.
How about that?

1010
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:18.720
$700 million bail out.
Isn't that awesome?
As an amazing country.
A lot better.

1011
01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.310
He's fucking motherfuckers.
You know,
I realized after eight years,

1012
01:03:23.311 --> 01:03:27.780
you know the [inaudible] is,
it's the goddamn factors.
You know what I mean?

1013
01:03:27.910 --> 01:03:30.720
No more fucking terrorists than anybody.
He sons of bitches,

1014
01:03:30.721 --> 01:03:31.800
you know what they're doing with that money.

1015
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:36.860
If they lowered interest rates so people can get alone,
fuck no.

1016
01:03:37.810 --> 01:03:41.450
GM is going under.
You know what they're doing with the money from what I,

1017
01:03:41.451 --> 01:03:45.210
I overheard on the radio,
is there a,

1018
01:03:45.780 --> 01:03:48.780
they're using it to buy up other failing banks,

1019
01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:54.000
just itching a sports.
The one World Bank,
that's what they're using it for.

1020
01:03:54.030 --> 01:03:59.030
And they have the audacity to raise the interest rates on credit cards to help

1021
01:03:59.731 --> 01:04:01.770
pay for this mortgage mess.

1022
01:04:02.070 --> 01:04:05.430
Then we just give you $700 billion to get you out of it.

1023
01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.660
I didn't know you were going to keep it so you could buy more assets and then

1024
01:04:09.661 --> 01:04:11.250
further,
fuck me in the ass.

1025
01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:15.480
It's up to 27% on some people's cards.

1026
01:04:16.410 --> 01:04:18.210
Don't they have some sort of usury laws?

1027
01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:21.660
There's anybody who's remotely,

1028
01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:26.610
I want to say majored in economics because anybody who understands this,

1029
01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.640
at what point w w what percentage is usually

1030
01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:36.600
they're up to 27% I mean,
back in the day did,
did the mob even do that?

1031
01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.430
They own everybody.

1032
01:04:41.431 --> 01:04:44.340
That's when I realized when I really looked at the whole economy that broken

1033
01:04:44.341 --> 01:04:47.370
everything down and I realized all the money I've made in this business,

1034
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.020
how much of it I've am I ever held in my hand?
You know,

1035
01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:55.290
I take out 100 bucks here,
a hundred bucks there.
I pay everything with the check.

1036
01:04:55.410 --> 01:04:58.140
I get paid and checks check numbers on a piece of paper.

1037
01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.520
And I kind of realized that even if I own shit,

1038
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:08.340
they can still be seized
with the Patriot Act that can be arrested,

1039
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:13.770
not charged and fucking waterboard you don't,

1040
01:05:13.780 --> 01:05:16.650
I realize I'm going to grow a mustache just in case Evian water pour it.

1041
01:05:17.290 --> 01:05:20.380
You know,
it's like you're still going to slowly draw me,
right.

1042
01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:21.730
Take water going up my nose.

1043
01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.290
It's going to grow in those big fucking 1976 symbols.
Mustaches,

1044
01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:31.290
you know Burt Reynolds,
you know,

1045
01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:34.540
he's got the best mustache ever.
And of course,
I don't know his name.

1046
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.940
He's a guy who was in the,
uh,

1047
01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:41.620
he was actually in the big Lebowski.
He was the narrator.
Sam Elliott.

1048
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:45.700
I mean that guy's mustache.
It's just,
it's fucking ridiculous.
Number one,

1049
01:05:45.701 --> 01:05:49.330
a mustache wasn't cool for like 20 years,
but he kept his,

1050
01:05:49.331 --> 01:05:53.570
his was so fucking cool.
You couldn't question his mustache.

1051
01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.920
That's like a man that's like a fucking panning for gold in the

1052
01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.600
1847 when the gold rush was anybody listen to this from San Francisco.

1053
01:06:05.710 --> 01:06:09.310
And he went out there and you're saying those awful fucking songs.

1054
01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.810
Oh my Darwin Oman.

1055
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:19.370
Darlin Darlin Klamath time.
You got the worst fucking name in the world.

1056
01:06:19.371 --> 01:06:21.140
You must be an ugly bitch.

1057
01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:24.500
Has there ever been a good looking woman named Clementine?

1058
01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:28.790
You notice that there's like hot girl names like Natasha.

1059
01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:31.250
I've never seen an ugly girl named Natasha yet.

1060
01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:33.230
I've never seen a cool girl named Natasha.

1061
01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:37.610
I always just see some hot girl who knows she's fucking hot at eight because her

1062
01:06:37.611 --> 01:06:42.470
name is Natasha,
which ends up making a B.
Really,
um,
uh,

1063
01:06:42.790 --> 01:06:44.390
con be honest with you.

1064
01:06:45.890 --> 01:06:48.890
Or is it more about me than I never had the courage to approach a girl named

1065
01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:53.840
Natasha Natasha.
That's actually about Brooke.

1066
01:06:53.870 --> 01:06:55.880
That's a good one.
Brooke.
Natasha.

1067
01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.793
<v 8>Uh,</v>

1068
01:06:59.820 --> 01:07:02.700
<v 7>not Melissa.
Let's just can kind of be down to earth.</v>

1069
01:07:05.010 --> 01:07:09.450
Some sort of offshoot of Melissa that I always noticed was what the fuck?

1070
01:07:10.290 --> 01:07:15.240
I don't know Jesus Christ as if the pressing out here,
it is absolutely overcast.

1071
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:20.010
I'll tell you,
the Midwest Midwestern,
the summertime,
when all the props,
you know,

1072
01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:24.870
a waving in the air,
you know,
makes you proud to be an American.

1073
01:07:24.871 --> 01:07:28.110
But when you're out here,
the beginning of winter,

1074
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.140
you start to understand crystal meth.

1075
01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:35.520
I get it now I understand the anger of slipknot.
I never understood those guys.

1076
01:07:35.521 --> 01:07:37.020
Like what the fuck are they so angry about?

1077
01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:41.010
And then I was in Iowa in like February and I was like,
you know what?
I get it.

1078
01:07:41.490 --> 01:07:44.370
I get it.
It's like a,

1079
01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:49.200
I dunno,
it,
it really fucking affects your mood.

1080
01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:53.820
This is awful for those guys looking for guys in the side of the road.

1081
01:07:54.550 --> 01:07:57.030
Then that's why those guys you see on the side of the road,

1082
01:07:57.031 --> 01:08:01.380
you're not picking up litter.
You know,
you're not mowing the grass.

1083
01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.100
You're not waiting to give somebody a ticket,
but you still got a little shine,

1084
01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:09.660
a little fucking siren on top of you car.
It's the neutral one though.

1085
01:08:10.770 --> 01:08:11.610
That orange one.

1086
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:14.590
<v 8>It's</v>

1087
01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.090
<v 7>like the,
uh,
that's</v>

1088
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:20.540
<v 8>like the Jen Brady of emergency vehicles.
Oh,</v>

1089
01:08:20.541 --> 01:08:24.020
the dad is super eight motel with an indoor pool.
Huh?

1090
01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:29.060
Who says this country's in trouble?
In trouble.
Wow.
They've really,

1091
01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:32.210
they really stepped it up.
They finally living up to that name.
Super Eight.

1092
01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:37.870
<v 7>Never Super.
When I went to it,
there's a steak and shake.
Next exit.</v>

1093
01:08:39.820 --> 01:08:42.430
Oh,
this is this part of the country.
For those you who don't travel,

1094
01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:43.600
this is steak and shake.

1095
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.730
Dairy Queen country heartland resort camping.

1096
01:08:49.690 --> 01:08:50.370
Do you know I had a,

1097
01:08:50.370 --> 01:08:55.370
I had a chance to go skeet shooting and DC and I got so fucking drunk with Joe

1098
01:08:55.680 --> 01:09:00.470
to Rosa the night before.
I couldn't do it.
Me and Joe de Rosa,

1099
01:09:00.650 --> 01:09:03.440
the guy I do uninformed with,
we are not good for each other.

1100
01:09:03.470 --> 01:09:07.280
That's what I realized when I think when we're by ourselves we can make good

1101
01:09:07.281 --> 01:09:11.050
decisions,
but when we are hanging out together,
everyone else,

1102
01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:14.150
you've got a friend like that.
We're after a while,

1103
01:09:14.151 --> 01:09:15.890
you know you just have to kind of tap out.

1104
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.400
I'm not saying I'm not going to be friends with Joe to Rosa anymore.
I just,

1105
01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:21.590
I dunno.
I don't think I can hang out with them anymore.

1106
01:09:23.070 --> 01:09:28.070
Why are you driving so fucking slow in the left lane with your high performance

1107
01:09:28.111 --> 01:09:32.720
muffler
type performance?
Mufflers a ridiculous,

1108
01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:35.360
didn't somebody sends something in about those being overrated?

1109
01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:40.810
Is Food Little Asian girls into thinking that you have a fast car?

1110
01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:43.740
<v 8>Bye.</v>

1111
01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:47.180
<v 7>You think it's an old guy with white hair or is that a baseball cap?</v>

1112
01:09:48.190 --> 01:09:52.750
Basically a Honda civic.
Early nineties
see ya.

1113
01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:54.100
<v 8>Okay.</v>

1114
01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.130
<v 7>With the hatchback,
it looks like he's got some sort of erector set</v>

1115
01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:01.170
suspension and you remember that shit.

1116
01:10:01.171 --> 01:10:04.810
Maybe erectus stuff that's back when they used to give you toys to try to make

1117
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:07.650
it smart to give like a chemistry set.

1118
01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:10.970
Can you hear that?
Can you hear his car?

1119
01:10:13.450 --> 01:10:14.850
<v 10>Well Wah Wah Wah.</v>

1120
01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.280
<v 7>No one's fucking 65</v>

1121
01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.960
he sounds like a motorcycle off in the distance and he's literally fucking 30

1122
01:10:20.961 --> 01:10:21.794
yards in front of me.

1123
01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:26.420
Some physics major out there doing the math right now to see if I'm not,

1124
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:28.160
if I'm following too closely behind.

1125
01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:29.730
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

1126
01:10:29.730 --> 01:10:33.440
<v 7>All right,
so we're up to 20 minutes.
That's not bad.
That's not bad.
You know I,</v>

1127
01:10:33.441 --> 01:10:36.910
this is how I used to do them.
It was like an old school one throw back,

1128
01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:40.320
a fucking throw back.
Um,
uh,

1129
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:44.540
I'm really going to be hating this drive when I come back to you realize that

1130
01:10:44.541 --> 01:10:47.600
I'm such a mate.
Why doesn't this guy have a side view mirror?
Okay,
here we go.

1131
01:10:47.710 --> 01:10:51.860
I'm driving by him and it is,
uh,
you know what?

1132
01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:55.690
It was a younger kid and he had one of those,
uh,

1133
01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.740
you know the goatee where you don't have the mustache,

1134
01:10:58.460 --> 01:11:03.140
but then you have like the really long shit hanging off your Chin basically says

1135
01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:05.750
,
uh,
you know,
I'm not wearing a condom.

1136
01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:12.280
Um,
I dunno.
Anyways,
let's,
let's heighten my gigs upcoming this week.
Okay.

1137
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:17.460
If you've enjoyed this podcast and you have a radio,
I will be,

1138
01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.530

1139

which is still great.

1140
01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:29.550
If we could get rid of these motherfucking bankers.
Um,

1141
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.250
and I'm going to be hyping my upcoming Gig,

1142

Friday and Saturday,

1145
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:49.110
We're going to be a telling some jokes or whatever.
And uh,

1146
01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.490
he came and saw me last year.

1147
01:11:50.491 --> 01:11:53.460
I wrote a whole new hour people in Nashville and listen to this.

1148
01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:57.390
I want to go skeet shooting.
I blew it in DC.
I want to go.

1149
01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:02.070
I want to learn how to shoot something.
That's my next pocket move.

1150
01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:07.170
Was I planned for the new world order?
Um,
so come on man.

1151
01:12:07.171 --> 01:12:10.590
I'm going down in Nashville.
I know what's The music city?
Capitol of the world.

1152
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.560
But God dammit,
just outside of it.

1153
01:12:13.561 --> 01:12:16.710
I know there's a bunch of people with guns and he got fields and I want to go up

1154
01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:21.630
there and shoot little plate disks is,
why don't you hook me up?
I got,
I got it.

1155
01:12:21.631 --> 01:12:24.720
Here you go.
Anybody who hooked me up,
take me out.

1156
01:12:24.721 --> 01:12:28.650
Go skeet shooting gets a free three,
three,

1157
01:12:28.740 --> 01:12:32.910
three DVD.
Say That 10 times fast for you.
Your buddy,

1158
01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:36.810
you go hunting within your best girlfriend with them.
Daisy Dukes,
mother fucker.

1159
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:40.560
I'm serious.
I want to,
I want to learn.
Okay.

1160
01:12:42.950 --> 01:12:47.030
Hey is his kid's mind greatest fucking conspiracy that I know they're going to

1161
01:12:47.031 --> 01:12:49.920
combine this country with fucking Mexico and with Canada.

1162
01:12:50.370 --> 01:12:54.810
Aside from the fact that they got that creepy commercial about how they have a

1163
01:12:54.811 --> 01:12:58.710
new enhanced driver's license that'll make it easier to travel between the

1164
01:12:58.711 --> 01:13:03.000
United States,
Canada and Mexico.
Personally,
I didn't know that was a problem.

1165
01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.570
I don't,
there was people around here going,
you know,
I love this country,

1166
01:13:06.571 --> 01:13:09.840
but I just wish it was easier to go to Canada.
God Damn it.

1167
01:13:09.841 --> 01:13:13.950
If I could just go to Mexico a little bit earlier,
I mean easier.

1168
01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:17.700
This is my big conspiracy.

1169
01:13:17.900 --> 01:13:22.050
I've noticed lately I'm traveling and airports and all of a sudden there's this

1170
01:13:22.051 --> 01:13:26.790
new software out there called the Rosetta stone,
which is a

1171
01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.960
Goddamn,
and I wish I looked it up.
I know that Rosetta stone is some sort of,

1172
01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.020
I don't,
I didn't know what the fuck it is.
It's something difficult.

1173
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:36.390
Is it like the hope diamond?
I don't know what it is,

1174
01:13:36.391 --> 01:13:40.980
but basically they took that name and it is now a software that teaches you a

1175
01:13:40.981 --> 01:13:45.090
bunch of different languages.
Okay.
Which I always thought was cool.

1176
01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.600
I want to learn another language,
but nobody in America has ever given a fuck.

1177
01:13:48.601 --> 01:13:51.390
Now all of a sudden they're selling these fucking things.

1178
01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:54.570
I was just getting off at the airport.
I can see if you're in New York,

1179
01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:59.310
if you're in Las hung delays where you could actually speak Spanish every

1180
01:13:59.311 --> 01:14:03.900
fucking three feet.
I get it
from maybe French or something like that.

1181
01:14:03.901 --> 01:14:04.261
I don't know,

1182
01:14:04.261 --> 01:14:09.261
but like I just got off it I the airport here in Indianapolis and this selling

1183
01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:12.880
the resent a stone software.
Who the fuck in Indianapolis

1184
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.540
is clamoring to learn a different language?

1185
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:19.840
You know something's going on.

1186
01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:23.170
They're putting it in your head and I'm telling you,
if you stick it around,

1187
01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.870
stick it out in front of people long enough they can.

1188
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:29.440
It's like Rubik's cubes when you really think about it.
Was that thing fun?

1189
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:34.900
It was kind of like a toy that was fixed and you spun it three times and then it

1190
01:14:34.901 --> 01:14:38.680
was broken and you can never get it fixed again unless you had an Asian friend

1191
01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:41.860
who for some reason figured out how to do it.

1192
01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:46.900
I don't know what it is about those guys.
They just fucking smarter than us.

1193
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:52.750
Is that like reverse racist in a way?
Because I actually said something,
uh,

1194
01:14:52.780 --> 01:14:53.613
fucking

1195
01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:59.110
you allowed to do that and I know you're not allowed to say something bad

1196
01:14:59.111 --> 01:15:02.800
straight across the bottom.
A race of people.
Can I say something good?

1197
01:15:04.980 --> 01:15:07.060
The politically correct police going to come at me.

1198
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:11.410
Now that's just as bad because that's offensive to stupid Asian people.

1199
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:15.730
It's going to make them feel even more retarded and we don't want that.

1200
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:21.730
Um,
anyways.
Wow.
I am really out here in the heartland right now.

1201
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:26.290
You know something?
People always say like,
that's the movement.
Start a farm,

1202
01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:30.910
start a farm,
save your money and that type of shit.
But as far as I can tell,

1203
01:15:31.570 --> 01:15:36.430
these farmers are fucked too.
What are you,
because they only grow one crop.

1204
01:15:37.450 --> 01:15:40.330
So what are you going to do?
What are you going to grow?
Fucking corn,
you know?

1205
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.860
All right,
you grow corn,
then everything goes down.
You can't afford food.

1206
01:15:44.861 --> 01:15:49.060
Even if he got well water on you,
on your fucking property.

1207
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:53.360
When you eat corn every fucking day.
Some point you got,

1208
01:15:53.390 --> 01:15:57.670
I guess maybe you can go out and shoot a pheasant
knows,
reminds me of a joke.

1209
01:15:57.671 --> 01:16:02.170
I used to wait a minute,
the hall of fame,
Nem,
Indiana basketball hall of fame.

1210
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:06.430
Get the fuck Outta here.
Jesus Christ.

1211
01:16:06.540 --> 01:16:09.460
That's going to be the big biggest collection of white basketball players with

1212
01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:13.690
booty shorts in the goddamn countries.
And you know Larry Bird,
he said Jesus,

1213
01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:18.280
and I can't argue with them.
Larry Bird.
Now there is,
it was,

1214
01:16:18.281 --> 01:16:22.310
it was an awful mustache.
He at a,

1215
01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:25.420
I have a cleft palate mustache at pieces.
That was me.

1216
01:16:25.421 --> 01:16:28.280
But you know what actually bought one of those kids a new smile.

1217
01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:33.010
So I'm able to do that joke.

1218
01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:39.480
Larry Bird had a fucking 14 year old white trash mustache when he was like 28.

1219
01:16:42.250 --> 01:16:44.530
I don't think it ever filled in his entire career,

1220
01:16:46.270 --> 01:16:50.200
that awful oval face,
goddammit.
He could play,

1221
01:16:50.530 --> 01:16:53.680
he could definitely place look at me trash and one of the icons of bus than they

1222
01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:58.000
would have thought.
Um,
anyways,
I'm going to end this podcast this week with uh,

1223
01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:03.790
with a joke I used to do back in my college days.
I was back in college.

1224
01:17:03.791 --> 01:17:06.430
This is what I,
when I do all the,
uh,
my college gigs,

1225
01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:11.240
standup gigs back before I was doing mainly clubs.
I used to land at the airport.

1226
01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:15.140
So I get around a car,
you know,
grab a couple of cds,

1227
01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:20.030
possibly cassette tapes,
depending on what point in my career.
And I drive across,

1228
01:17:20.170 --> 01:17:24.770
you know,
the farm lands out here in
the Midwest.

1229
01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:30.380
And I ended up getting a joke out of it and this was the joke that was like,

1230
01:17:30.381 --> 01:17:32.420
you know,
every time you see farmers on the news,

1231
01:17:32.421 --> 01:17:36.140
you always see him bitching about how difficult farming is.
You know what?

1232
01:17:36.170 --> 01:17:41.000
I must've driven by 10,000 farms during my standup career.
And you know what?

1233
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:42.800
I've never seen anybody doing shit.

1234
01:17:44.390 --> 01:17:47.570
Attract is always parked.
Cows standing around,

1235
01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.660
there's absolutely no fucking activity whatsoever.

1236
01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:55.070
And there's always a big satellite dish.
They're in there watching fucking ESPN.

1237
01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:56.870
And then when the media comes by,

1238
01:17:56.890 --> 01:17:59.780
they just smear a bunch of dirt on their face and they're like,
oh my God,

1239
01:17:59.781 --> 01:18:04.370
there was a typhoon
joke when something like that.
And you know what,

1240
01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:08.260
today is no different.
I just drove by 40 farms.

1241
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:11.690
I have not seen one fucking person.
The lights aren't even on there.

1242
01:18:11.691 --> 01:18:15.590
And then napping,
I don't know.

1243
01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:18.160
I don't know what they do at the time of year.
All the crops,
it cut down.

1244
01:18:18.170 --> 01:18:19.660
Who the fuck knows?
But anyways,

1245
01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.530
here's something out to all the people on my space.

1246
01:18:21.531 --> 01:18:23.840
I would really appreciate it if you would,
uh,

1247
01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:28.790
go onto my website [inaudible] dot com and sign up for my mailing list because,

1248
01:18:29.210 --> 01:18:32.690
uh,
I'm sort of inching my way over to that one more so than the mindspace.

1249
01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.000
I'll still put shit up on my space,
but,
uh,

1250
01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:38.930
I plan to start blogging and all that crap once I get done with this uninformed

1251
01:18:38.931 --> 01:18:42.780
tour.
A lot of,
uh,
putting some extras on there because,
you know,

1252
01:18:43.310 --> 01:18:47.420
I haven't joined Facebook yet and I just really don't feel like going over to

1253
01:18:47.421 --> 01:18:51.500
Facebook and have to add the same 30,000 fucking people that I already have.

1254
01:18:51.501 --> 01:18:55.550
So if you go to my website,
then,
you know what I mean,
and I won't spam you.

1255
01:18:55.640 --> 01:19:00.320
And plus you're also able to control
what sort of,

1256
01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:04.310
uh,
emails you get from me.
Like when I said I was going in Nashville,

1257
01:19:04.311 --> 01:19:06.680
I just emailed people on my Nashville lists.
Okay.

1258
01:19:06.681 --> 01:19:10.430
So you're not going to get fucking updates from me every week is I have some

1259
01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:13.850
sort of Zany picture trying to utilize the web.

1260
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:18.170
This is my one once a week thing that I do,
which I think is a good thing.
Okay.

1261
01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:23.270
I usually do it on Mondays.
I fuck around.
I give you a fucking free audio show.

1262
01:19:24.140 --> 01:19:28.070
All right?
It's a lot more than that.
Some of these other cons out there doing.

1263
01:19:28.071 --> 01:19:30.140
Right?
All right.
That's it.

1264
01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:34.700
That's the Monday morning podcast on a Tuesday.
I Apologize,

1265
01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:38.300
I didn't get any cell phone service.
So,
uh,
God bless all of you.

1266
01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.680
God bless the United States of America.
Fuck the bankers.

1267
01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:46.400
Please go on the Internet and start reading about banking.

1268
01:19:46.401 --> 01:19:49.980
Please read about it and just read what the fuck over it is.
And,
uh,

1269
01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000
educate yourself with conspiracy theory that is based in Wikipedia

1270
01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:02.150
and youtube videos.
It's not all bad,
everybody.

1271
01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:05.090
I don't like this.
I'm telling you,
man,
I don't like Internet.

1272
01:20:05.150 --> 01:20:07.400
Internet gets a bad rep and like it.

1273
01:20:07.960 --> 01:20:09.810
I like how the everything on the Internet's a lie,

1274
01:20:09.811 --> 01:20:13.260
but TV's telling you the truth.
Think about the insanity of that man.

1275
01:20:13.261 --> 01:20:17.020
That's fucking ridiculous.
Dip bowls full of Shit.
And so my throwing,

1276
01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:20.340
fucking listen to me.
I have a good week.
And please,

1277
01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:24.510
if you live anywhere in the Nashville,
please come down,
come out and see me.
Um,

1278
01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:29.320
and um,
that is it.
That's it.
All right,
everybody have a good week.

1279
01:20:29.530 --> 01:20:33.470
I said that 15 test.
Got Them.
But I want you to know,
I really mean it.

1280
01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:36.260
I hope you have a great team.
All right.
God bless.
