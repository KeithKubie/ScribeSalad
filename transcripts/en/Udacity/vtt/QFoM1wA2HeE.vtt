00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.840
Our code now feels a little easier to read because previously the move

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.000
function was stored outside the carlike function.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.860
And it was at a different level of indentation, even though it

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:13.930
was a property of the object eventually, just like the loc property is.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.060
At this point all the code related to the obj that gets returned is at

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.490
the same level of indentation.
