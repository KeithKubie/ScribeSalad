just begin by saying it's I'm relatively
 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.279
just begin by saying it's I'm relatively
new to Columbia this is the middle of my

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289
new to Columbia this is the middle of my
 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.010
new to Columbia this is the middle of my
second year but I feel like I've come in

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020
second year but I feel like I've come in
 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.740
second year but I feel like I've come in
a particularly fortunate and exciting

time it's like getting on a train that's

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430
time it's like getting on a train that's
 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.969
time it's like getting on a train that's
really going in very interesting journey

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979

throughout the 20th century but in the

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:52.900
throughout the 20th century but in the
 

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.989
throughout the 20th century but in the
past decades it's been those areas that

00:07:54.989 --> 00:07:54.999
past decades it's been those areas that
 

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.689
past decades it's been those areas that
have been more restricted by by lack of

have been more restricted by by lack of
 

00:07:57.699 --> 00:08:00.899
have been more restricted by by lack of
space and so these buildings give us a

00:08:00.899 --> 00:08:00.909
space and so these buildings give us a
 

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:03.480

think one concrete way to think about it

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:10.719
think one concrete way to think about it
 

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:12.329
think one concrete way to think about it
is it gives us a chance to improve the

is it gives us a chance to improve the
 

00:08:12.339 --> 00:08:13.890
is it gives us a chance to improve the

departments and they're very well ranked
 

00:08:17.889 --> 00:08:20.279
departments and they're very well ranked
but we would like to bring them all into

but we would like to bring them all into
 

00:08:20.289 --> 00:08:22.559
but we would like to bring them all into
the top five if we possibly can that is
