00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.900
Hi, I’m Thomas Frank, this is Crash Course
Study Skills, and today you’re going through
planning and organization boot camp.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.440
As a student, you have two modes, which I
like to call Planning Mode and Robot Mode.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.600
When you buckle down to study for a test, finish a
homework assignment, or slog your way through
a textbook chapter, you’re in Robot Mode.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.540
You’re doing the work.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.020
But robots can only do what they’re
programmed to do, and they need a
well-maintained environment to work in.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.820
I’ve seen videos of those robots in car
factories – they’re not working with dirty laundry
or cheeseburger wrappers laying around.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.920
Those places are pretty clean.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.160
So, if you want your Robot mode to work efficiently,
you need to know how to program it and how to
create a good environment for it to work in.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:43.140
[Theme Music]

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.820
To get started, you’re going to need an
organizational system.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.860
This is the framework for storing all
information and resources that we’ll need,
and also for capturing “ideas.”

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.440
An “Idea” is my term for any intangible
information that you need to save and have
easy access to later on.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.400
This can include: Tasks, Events, and actual,
you know, ideas – things you want to write,
create – anything like that.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:11.140
Additionally, you’ll need a reliable way to store:
Notes, Handouts, and any other output you create, be
it writing, code, art, or cheeseburger wrapper origami.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.540
So let’s get down to business, defeat the
huns, and create that system.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.740
In my mind, any good organizational system
worth its salt includes:

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.450
A task manager
A calendar

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.280
A note-taking system
And Some kind of physical storage for paper documents

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.800
Your task manager is the place where you record
the stuff that you need to get done.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.319
It’s what you look to when you get that
sudden burst of motivation to do ALL THE THINGS,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.869
and then wonder what all the things actually
includes.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.640
You’ll find a zillion different types of
task managers out there, but there are only
a few really essential features.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.460
Pick a system that makes it easy to record a
task’s details and due date, and also make sure it’s
a snap to see what’s coming due in the near future.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.400
The task manager that I personally use these
days is called Todoist, and it ticks all those boxes.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.660
But there are lots of other options, including
Trello, Microsoft To-Do, and Any.Do.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.900
And if paper systems are more your speed, the classic day planner works just as well, as do more recent systems like the Bullet Journal method.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.460
In addition to tasks, you’ll also need to
remember upcoming events, and that’s what
your calendar is for.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.920
Now if you’re using an old-fashioned paper
planner, then your task manager and calendar
might be one in the same –

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.420
but personally, I’ve always found that keeping
the two separate works better for me.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.320
A calendar – in my case, Google Calendar, but it might be Apple’s Calendar app or something else for you – is best for events that will happen at a specific time,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.840
while a task manager better handles things
that have due dates, but that you can work
on whenever you want before then.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.360
Next, you need to figure out how to organize
your notes.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.610
This is pretty simple for paper notes; you
just use paper notebooks, and have a separate
section or entire notebook for each class.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.300
But, for digital notes, you’ve got a lot
of options.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.820
Now, my app of choice has always been Evernote,
but you can also take a look at Microsoft’s OneNote,

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.320
Apple’s Notes (they’re not always
super imaginative with naming over there
in Cupertino), or even Google Docs.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.580
Lastly, make sure you’ve got some kind of
physical storage for handouts, loose papers,
and notebooks you’ve filled up.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.280
Keeping one of those portable accordion folders in your bag works well when you’re away from home, and it combos well with a file box for longer-term storage.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.540
Now once you’ve cobbled your system
together, the next step is to develop an scheme
for keeping it all organized.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.680
Now, sometimes a scheme is a plan for getting a bunch of small, yellow minions and attempting to steal the moon, and I definitely don’t want to discourage you from doing that.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.980
But, in this context, it just means a set
of rules and conventions that help to keep
your system organized and useful.

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.560
If you choose a good scheme and stick to its rules
every time you file away a new task, event, or handout,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.980
then the system will remain useful and you won’t find yourself digging through your laundry basket at 3 a.m. looking for that essay you wrote on Hamlet.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.380
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:28.140
Your computer’s file structure is a great place
to start, since so many people seem content to
just let everything sit out on their desktop.

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.220
This is a pretty bad scheme to use, because
you’re eventually going to lose something.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.060
Plus, all those files will be covering up
that Hatsune Miku desktop background
that I know you have.

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.600
So a better long-term solution is to create a
folder structure that’s well-defined, yet flexible.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.180
My recommendation is to set up your computer’s
folders like a tree with lots of branches.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.240
The top-level folder is the root of the tree,
and that’s where the scheme starts.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.879
So, in this case, that folder will be called
“College.”

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.140
From there, try to create branches that represent
the different aspects of that part of your life.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.000
The first logical branch point in this situation is
the year – freshman, sophomore, junior, senior.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.310
Then, as we go further and hit even more
specific branch points, choose a logical category
for drilling down to the next level.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.340
And this changes depending on the type of
information you're organizing.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.560
Like, here, organizing by class makes sense.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.079
We’ve got Sports Psychology, History of
Rome, and Film Studies 101.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.580
And finally, add subfolders for big group
projects.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.340
If you’re constantly vigilant about saving your work in the correct folder, then this structure will ensure that it’s always easy to find what you’re looking for –

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.800
you just go down the branches that lead to it.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.960
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.220
You can use a similar structure with your
digital notes as well.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.460
This is why I like using Evernote so much.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.840
Since everything is organized into Notebooks,
and Notebooks themselves can be put into stacks, I
can create a scheme that organizes my entire life.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.340
For instance, I’ve got a notebook stack
for classes.

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.320
Within it, every class I’ve ever taken gets
its own notebook,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.920
and within those notebooks I can
create notes for individual lectures, reading
assignments, and other things.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.860
With your calendar, color-code events so you
can see which part of your life they represent,

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.940
like classes, extracurricular activities,
and part-time job hours.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.460
If you use a paper planner, you can do this
by using colored stickers or markers, as well.

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.240
Lastly, create projects within your task manager
for grouping similar tasks together.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.500
If you’re a student, the most logical way to do this is
to create a project for each class, as well as additional
projects for anything else you’ve got going on.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:12.240
Now that you’ve chosen your tools and have your system set up, you need to make sure you’ll actually use it, since putting things into your system properly takes work.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.680
If your teacher assigns something in class,
you eventually need to open your task manager
and record all the details correctly.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.700
That takes more effort than simply tossing
that handout into your backpack or telling
yourself, “Eh, I’m sure I’ll remember it.”

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.940
But if you don’t do it, your system started
to get unorganized and incomplete – which
means your brain can’t rely on it anymore.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.620
So you need to build the habit of using your system
correctly all the time, even though it takes effort.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:38.260
And one of the best ways to do that is to
remove as much friction as you possibly
can from the process.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:45.520
This is an idea that I like to call quick capture –
figuring out the quickest, easiest way to file things
into your system without compromising its structure.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.039
There are two main ways to go about practicing
quick capture.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.700
The first is to commit to entering things into
the correct place the moment they come up.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.820
For instance, if your teacher assigns
homework in class, you’d immediately open your
task manager and record all the details.

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.740
If you do choose to go this route, you can
streamline things by choosing apps and tools
that simplify the recording process.

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.340
A good example is Google Calendar’s iPhone app,
which lets you set the date, time, and location of
an event just by typing them into the event’s title.

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.639
That’s a lot quicker than tapping on each
individual field.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.860
It also means eliminating any unnecessary
features from your system;

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.380
while it might be cool that your to-do
app can add priority levels to each task,
you probably don’t need them,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.560
and they just add more friction
to the process.

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.600
The second option here is to use a daily note,
which is a simple piece of notebook paper,

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.020
or a note that’s quickly accessible on your
phone, where you record everything that comes
up during the day.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.880
This is a temporary holding place.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.660
At the end of each day, you need to move everything
you’ve recorded to the correct place within your system.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.180
All right, so now we are ready to finally
dig into the details of planning.

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:44.280
Now, I like to view planning in two separate
contexts: weekly and daily.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:49.540
The main purpose of your weekly planning session is to look at everything that’s coming due during the upcoming week, as well as in the following one.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:51.180
I recommend doing this on Sunday;

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:57.020
that way, you’ll be aware of everything that’s coming up, and you’ll have a rough idea of when you’ll be able to work on it all based on what’s already in your calendar.

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.040
However, there is also some long-term planning
that should be done here.

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:04.660
First, if you’ve got an exam coming up in
the next month, it’s a good idea to look over
everything that will be covered,

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:10.020
and then to schedule study sessions over
the upcoming weeks to ensure you don’t find
yourself cramming right before it.

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:16.080
If you’ve just been assigned a big project, you
can similarly break that project down into small
chunks and assign due dates to those chunks.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.740
Think about other big events that might be
coming up in your life as well.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.680
Maybe there’s a scholarship deadline coming
up, or a birthday you want to remember.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.560
If something comes to mind, add it to your
system so you won’t forget it.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.860
In addition to planning out your week, you
should also take a few minutes each day to
create a daily plan.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:32.259
This is simply a list of the events you’ve
got planned and the tasks you want to accomplish.

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:37.580
Now you can do this in the morning before
you start school, or you can do it at night before
you go to bed, which is what I prefer to do.

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.940
As you create it, try to batch your tasks.

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:46.100
If you have a bunch of easy, low-energy tasks, or
errands that require travel, plan ahead and combine
them into one big maintenance session.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:53.020
Doing this will help you get them all done in a short, compact block of time, which in turn frees up lots of uninterrupted time that you can dedicate to your really challenging work.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.220
Finally, to keep your system running smoothly,
choose one day per week to do a review session.

00:07:57.220 --> 00:08:02.680
And if you want to be extra-efficient, you
can just combine it with your weekly planning
in order to get it all done in one fell swoop.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.060
During this review session, you’ll do a
couple things.

00:08:05.069 --> 00:08:08.120
First, look over your plans and reflect on
the past week.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:13.620
Compare what you planned to do with what
actually got done, and if there’s a gap between
the two, try to figure out what caused it.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.780
Doing this can help you to pinpoint things that are hurting your productivity – maybe you were distracted a lot, or maybe you simply planned to do too much.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.060
After that, go through your task manager and
calendar.

00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:24.680
If there are any tasks or events that need
changes, make them.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:32.440
This prevents what I like to call “entropy” which is a term in thermodynamics that generally refers to how everything in the universe tends to move toward disorder and chaos.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:40.620
This is exactly what organizational systems tend to do as well, but by regularly bringing them back to order on a weekly basis, you can keep things from getting too chaotic.

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:48.340
So now that you’ve got your system build and your planning habits in place, you’re well equipped to tackle all the work your classes are going to throw at you in the most effective way possible.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:53.940
Additionally, you can rest assured knowing that
nothing will slip your mind or fall through the cracks,
as long as you keep those habits up.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:56.770
That’s all for now, so thanks for watching,
and I’ll see you next time.
