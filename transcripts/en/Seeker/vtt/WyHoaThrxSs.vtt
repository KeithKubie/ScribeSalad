00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.690
Just a heads up, we’re gonna talk about
contrails today and I’m going to say the

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.259
word moist.

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:11.330
A lot.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.390
Moist Hey there everyone, Julian in for DNews.

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.490
Every now and then you’ll look up and see
thin white clouds streaking across the sky.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.890
As most of you know those come from airplanes,
but you may be wondering how they form, or

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:22.939
what they’re made of.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:27.080
Now, some might have you think that contrails
are chemicals dumped into the air by the government

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.189
to control your mind and make you download
Pokemon Go.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.540
But as it turns out they’re just Ice.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.540
Ice baby.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.540
For the most part.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.660
See, ice crystals form more easily when water
vapor has a seed it can latch onto and start

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.660
crystallizing.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.640
If you’ve ever done that fun experiment
at home where you cool distilled water past

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.850
0 degrees celsius and then dunk an ice cube
in to instantly freeze the whole thing, you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.440
might know what I’m talking about.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.720
Aircraft exhaust consists of CO2, water vapor,
nitrous oxides, carbon monoxide, sulfates,

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.430
hydrocarbons, soot and metal flakes.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.220
Some of those aerosols are just the “ice
cube” needed for larger ice crystals to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.220
grow.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.140
Actually aircraft exhaust provides more than
just the starting point for water vapor in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.920
the air to condensate, it actually adds more
water vapor.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.320
Jet fuel, like the gasoline in your car, is
made up predominantly of hydrocarbons.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.260
Hydrocarbons, as the name implies, are molecules
of hydrogen and carbon.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.010
When they’re mixed with oxygen and combusted,
the chemical products are carbon dioxide and

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.010
H2O.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:21.680
You know that water dropping out of your muffler?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.680
Same concept.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.260
So exploding jet fuel contributes more water
to the air, upping the moisture past its saturation

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.250
point and kicking off the ice forming process.

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.270
At least that’s how it happens when the
ambient air is already moist and cold enough.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.400
If it’s too dry or warm, you get no contrails
at all.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.950
The moisture also determines how long the
contrails stick around for.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.710
As the exhaust cools, if it’s just barely
in the moisture threshold, contrails will

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.700
form and then disappear after a few minutes.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.729
If the ambient air was more moist to begin
with, they’ll persist, sometimes even spreading

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.670
out as a sheet with the wind.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.260
You may have seen contrail cousins like the
wisps left by wingtips.

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.170
Obviously those aren’t caused by jet exhaust,
but they are caused by a drop in pressure.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.400
At high angles of attack like during takeoff
or during high g-maneuvers, the wingtip boundary

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.640
stirs up a vortex, and the vortex drops the
pressure.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.350
When pressure drops, temperature drops, so
even though the moisture level hasn’t changed,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.750
the air is now cold enough to become liquid
water, albeit briefly.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.180
Now I know, I can practically hear some of
the comments already, claiming that contrails

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.349
are one big fat conspiracy and I’m a shill
or a sheeple… sheeperson?

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.319
What’s the singular form of sheeple?

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.680
But evidence would suggest otherwise.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.500
There are actual airplanes that intentionally
dump out chemicals, like crop dusters or aerial

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.320
acrobatic teams like the RAF’s Red Arrows
that use smoke effects.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.320
The Red Arrows actually make smoke by dumping
diesel directly into the exhaust, so it sounds

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.940
pretty similar to how chemtrails are purported
to work.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.690
But these mists or plumes of smoke can be
seen directly behind the nozzles or engine.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.240
Since contrails are formed by freezing water,
there’s a gap between the engine and the

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240
trail.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.430
At 8 kilometers up it is mighty cold, less
than -40 degrees celsius, but it still takes

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.459
some time to cool the hot exhaust gasses to
freezing.

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.459
Hence the gap.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.459
Hence the evidence that it’s just ice.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.870
Much as I like thinking about conspiracies
they’re almost never true…

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:06.240
almost [wink].

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.740
Yet people still believe them.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:22.060
To find out why, I explored it in another
video over here.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:35.960
Seriously what is the singular form of sheeple?
