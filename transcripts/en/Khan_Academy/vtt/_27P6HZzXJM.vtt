00:00:00.682 --> 00:00:02.429
- [Instructor] In the part
one video, we already saw

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.204
James Madison and Federalist number 10.

00:00:05.204 --> 00:00:08.451
argue strongly that a
republican form of government

00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:11.319
is better for addressing
the issues of having

00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:13.829
an majority faction that might try

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.299
to overrun minority groups.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.026
In this video, we're
going to continue to see

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:21.793
that argument that not
only is a republic better,

00:00:21.793 --> 00:00:23.485
but if you're going to have a republic,

00:00:23.485 --> 00:00:25.177
it's better to have a large republic.

00:00:25.177 --> 00:00:28.681
In the next place, as each
representative will be chosen

00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:31.021
by a greater number of
citizens in the large,

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:33.421
the large republic, than
in the small republic.

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:36.246
It will be more difficult
for unworthy candidates

00:00:36.246 --> 00:00:40.197
to practice with success the
vicious art by which elections

00:00:40.197 --> 00:00:44.085
are too often carried and
the suffrages of the people

00:00:44.085 --> 00:00:48.348
be more free will be more
likely to center in men

00:00:48.348 --> 00:00:51.064
who possess the most attractive merit.

00:00:51.064 --> 00:00:53.167
Once again, elite democracy,
and the most diffusive

00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:55.142
and established characters.

00:00:55.142 --> 00:00:56.665
Once again, elite democracy.

00:00:56.665 --> 00:00:58.130
So here, he is making the
argument that not only

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.963
in a large republic will
you have a better choice

00:01:00.963 --> 00:01:03.748
of candidates, but because
the candidates have to appeal

00:01:03.748 --> 00:01:07.002
each to a large number of
people, that they are less likely

00:01:07.002 --> 00:01:09.115
to come to power through shady dealings

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:12.246
and you're mostly likely
to get the best folks.

00:01:12.246 --> 00:01:16.314
It must be confessed that in
this, as in most other cases,

00:01:16.314 --> 00:01:18.921
there is a mean on both
sides of which inconveniences

00:01:18.921 --> 00:01:20.700
will be found to lie.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.585
So you say hey look, there
is, as in all things,

00:01:23.585 --> 00:01:25.222
there is kind of a moderate middle ground.

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:27.592
By enlarging too much
the number of electors,

00:01:27.592 --> 00:01:31.233
you render the representatives
to little acquainted

00:01:31.233 --> 00:01:35.302
with all their local circumstances
and lesser interests,

00:01:35.302 --> 00:01:37.969
as by reducing it too
much, you render him unduly

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.579
attached to these and too
little fit to comprehend

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.187
and pursue great and national objects.

00:01:44.187 --> 00:01:48.340
The federal Constitution
forms a happy combination

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.796
in this respect.

00:01:49.796 --> 00:01:52.864
The great and aggregate
interests being referred to

00:01:52.864 --> 00:01:55.367
the national, the local and particular

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.441
to the state legislatures.

00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:59.599
So what he's saying is that
the Constitution offers

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.255
this really nice balance here.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:05.247
You can have the people
participating at the national level

00:02:05.247 --> 00:02:09.731
who are interested in the
great and aggregate interests

00:02:09.731 --> 00:02:13.381
and it's okay if those folks
aren't completely attached

00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:15.571
to what is happening at
home, the local interests.

00:02:15.571 --> 00:02:17.867
In fact, he'd probably prefer
that they're not attached

00:02:17.867 --> 00:02:20.093
too much to the local interests,
but the local interests

00:02:20.093 --> 00:02:23.176
could be focused at
the state legislatures,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:25.550
which the Constitution provides for.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.092
The other point of
difference, so once again,

00:02:28.092 --> 00:02:29.383
he is referring to the
difference between a republican

00:02:29.383 --> 00:02:31.684
government and a pure democracy.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:33.968
The greater number of
citizens in the extent

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:36.295
of territory which may be
brought within the compass

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:39.337
of republican than of
democratic government.

00:02:39.337 --> 00:02:40.964
So it's that point that he believes

00:02:40.964 --> 00:02:43.286
the republican government
can better govern

00:02:43.286 --> 00:02:45.750
a large population than a pure democracy

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.427
and it is this circumstance principally

00:02:48.427 --> 00:02:52.365
which renders the factious
combinations less to be dreaded

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:54.453
in the former than in the latter.

00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:57.587
So he's saying because a
republican model can govern

00:02:57.587 --> 00:03:01.499
over more people, it
better addresses this issue

00:03:01.499 --> 00:03:03.944
of factious combinations.

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:07.931
The smaller the society,
the fewer probably will be

00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.909
the distinct parties and
interests composing it.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:13.994
The fewer the distinct
parties and interests,

00:03:13.994 --> 00:03:17.470
the more frequently will a
majority be found of the same

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.705
party, and the smaller
the number of individuals

00:03:21.705 --> 00:03:24.953
composing a majority and
the smaller the compass

00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:27.627
within which they are
placed, the more easily

00:03:27.627 --> 00:03:32.467
will they concert and execute
their plans of oppression.

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:36.280
Extend the sphere and you
take in a greater variety

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.576
of parties and interests.

00:03:38.576 --> 00:03:41.428
You make it less probable
that a majority of the whole

00:03:41.428 --> 00:03:43.799
will have a common motive to invade

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.535
the rights of other citizens.

00:03:46.535 --> 00:03:48.860
What Madison is saying here
is if you have too small

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.258
of a society, you're not going
to have enough pluralism,

00:03:51.258 --> 00:03:53.734
you're not going to have
enough points of view,

00:03:53.734 --> 00:03:56.421
that it will be easy because
people will be very aligned

00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:59.851
for a majority to take over and infringe

00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:01.518
on the rights of a minority.

00:04:01.518 --> 00:04:04.030
So he is very pro pluralism here.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.169
He wants to see a large society
with many different views

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.034
because he says if you
have a large society

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.403
with many different views,
with many different parties,

00:04:14.403 --> 00:04:16.447
so to speak, well then it's less likely

00:04:16.447 --> 00:04:19.554
that one party can just take
over and infringe on the rights

00:04:19.554 --> 00:04:21.412
of other people.

00:04:21.412 --> 00:04:24.452
This is the exact opposite of
what Brutus one argues for.

00:04:24.452 --> 00:04:28.062
Brutus one argues that
pluralism is a bad thing,

00:04:28.062 --> 00:04:30.274
that people are just going to
be bickering the whole time

00:04:30.274 --> 00:04:32.309
and decisions aren't going to be made.

00:04:32.309 --> 00:04:35.246
Brutus one argues that in a
republic, people should be

00:04:35.246 --> 00:04:37.875
of roughly the same
opinion, to have roughly

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:40.629
the same interests while
here in Federalist number 10,

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.214
Madison is arguing that no,
pluralism is a good thing,

00:04:44.214 --> 00:04:47.635
it is a check on an overbearing faction,

00:04:47.635 --> 00:04:50.000
it is a check on majority rule.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.723
Hence, it clearly appears
that the same advantage

00:04:53.723 --> 00:04:57.624
which a republic has over
a democracy in controlling

00:04:57.624 --> 00:05:01.291
the effects of faction
is enjoyed by a large

00:05:02.295 --> 00:05:05.632
over a small republic,
is enjoyed by the Union

00:05:05.632 --> 00:05:08.049
over the states composing it.

00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:11.488
So the big picture of Federalist number 10

00:05:11.488 --> 00:05:13.068
is how do you control faction?

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:15.634
And faction is really
about how do you control

00:05:15.634 --> 00:05:17.344
a majority faction
that's trying to control

00:05:17.344 --> 00:05:20.535
everyone else and trying
to oppress everyone else.

00:05:20.535 --> 00:05:22.126
Madison makes the argument that one,

00:05:22.126 --> 00:05:25.048
through a republican system,
you're more like to do this,

00:05:25.048 --> 00:05:27.373
by having a representative government.

00:05:27.373 --> 00:05:29.312
And then if you have that,
you want to make it larger

00:05:29.312 --> 00:05:32.804
rather than smaller so that
you have a pluralist society,

00:05:32.804 --> 00:05:35.080
so you have many points
of view and you don't have

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.282
one group being able to dominate.

00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:39.574
And in order to have that larger society,

00:05:39.574 --> 00:05:41.936
the Union is more favorable over having

00:05:41.936 --> 00:05:44.686
13 independent, sovereign states.

00:05:46.088 --> 00:05:49.290
In the extent and proper
structure of the Union,

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:51.983
therefore, we behold a republican remedy

00:05:51.983 --> 00:05:54.908
for the diseases most incident
to republican government

00:05:54.908 --> 00:05:58.335
and according to the degree
of pleasure and pride

00:05:58.335 --> 00:06:01.232
we feel in being republicans
ought to be our zeal

00:06:01.232 --> 00:06:03.533
and cherishing the spirit and supporting

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.571
the character of Federalists.
