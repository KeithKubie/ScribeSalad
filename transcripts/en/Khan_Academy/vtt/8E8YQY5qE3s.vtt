00:00:00.379 --> 00:00:01.492
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.492 --> 00:00:04.233
is dig a little bit deeper
into confidence intervals.

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:08.399
In other videos, we compute
them, we even interpret them,

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.978
but here we're gonna make sure that we are

00:00:10.978 --> 00:00:12.385
making the right assumptions

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:14.991
so that we can have confidence
in our confidence intervals

00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:17.098
or that we are even calculating
them in the right way

00:00:17.098 --> 00:00:19.179
or in the right context.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:21.031
So just as a bit of review,

00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.955
a lot of what we do in
confidence intervals is

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:28.421
we're trying to estimate
some population parameter.

00:00:28.421 --> 00:00:29.598
Let's say it's the proportion,

00:00:29.598 --> 00:00:31.737
maybe it's the proportion that
will vote for a candidate.

00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:35.586
We can't survey everyone
so we take a sample.

00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:36.540
And from that sample,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.447
maybe we calculate a sample proportion.

00:00:39.447 --> 00:00:42.046
And then using this sample proportion,

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:44.866
we calculate a confidence interval

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.393
on either side of that sample proportion.

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:50.611
And what we know is that if we do this

00:00:50.611 --> 00:00:51.753
many, many, many times,

00:00:51.753 --> 00:00:53.988
every time we do it we
are very likely to have a

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:55.636
different sample proportion.

00:00:55.636 --> 00:00:58.782
So that'd be sample proportion
one, sample proportion two.

00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:01.478
And every time we do it, we might get,

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:03.171
maybe this is sample proportion two,

00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.180
not only will we get a different,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.165
I guess you can say
center of our interval,

00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.718
but the margin of error might change

00:01:09.718 --> 00:01:13.575
because we are using the
sample proportion to calculate.

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.216
But the first assumption,
that has to be true.

00:01:16.216 --> 00:01:19.326
And even (mumbles) any claims
about this confidence interval

00:01:19.326 --> 00:01:22.756
with confidence, is that
your sample is random.

00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:25.506
So that you have a random sample.

00:01:27.194 --> 00:01:29.866
If you're trying to estimate
the proportion of people

00:01:29.866 --> 00:01:31.805
that are gonna vote
for a certain candidate

00:01:31.805 --> 00:01:36.331
but you are only surveying
people at a senior community,

00:01:36.331 --> 00:01:38.269
well, that would not be
a truly random sample,

00:01:38.269 --> 00:01:40.901
if we were only to survey
people on a college campus.

00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:42.625
So like with all things with statistics,

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:43.649
you really wanna make sure

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.609
that you're dealing with a random sample

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:47.956
and take great care to do that.

00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:50.131
The second thing that we have to assume,

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:53.550
and this is sometimes known
as the normal condition,

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.029
normal condition.

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:58.967
Remember, the whole basis
behind confidence intervals

00:01:58.967 --> 00:02:00.987
is we assume that the distribution

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.458
of the sample proportions,

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:05.115
the sampling distribution
of the sample proportions,

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:08.198
has roughly a normal shape like that.

00:02:09.437 --> 00:02:11.632
But in order to make that assumption

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:12.882
that it's roughly normal,

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.955
we have this normal condition.

00:02:14.955 --> 00:02:18.996
And the rule of thumb here
is that you would expect

00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.829
per sample more than 10 successes,

00:02:23.298 --> 00:02:24.131
successes,

00:02:25.893 --> 00:02:28.310
successes, and failures each,

00:02:29.375 --> 00:02:30.315
each.

00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:34.015
So for example, if your
sample size was only 10,

00:02:34.015 --> 00:02:38.492
let's say the true
proportion was 50% or 0.5,

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:39.941
then you wouldn't meet
that normal condition

00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:42.582
because you would expect five successes

00:02:42.582 --> 00:02:44.667
and five failures for each sample.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.257
Now, because usually when we're
doing confidence intervals

00:02:47.257 --> 00:02:49.821
we don't even know the
true population parameter,

00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:51.714
what we would actually just do is

00:02:51.714 --> 00:02:54.145
look at our sample and just count

00:02:54.145 --> 00:02:56.711
how many successes and
how many failures we have.

00:02:56.711 --> 00:03:00.934
And if we have less than
10 on either one of those,

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:03.858
then we are going to have a problem.

00:03:03.858 --> 00:03:07.347
So you wanna have at least
greater than or equal to

00:03:07.347 --> 00:03:08.889
10 successes or failures on each.

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.690
And you actually don't
even have to say expect

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.383
because you're going to get a sample

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:14.471
and you could just
count how many successes

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:16.044
and failures you have.

00:03:16.044 --> 00:03:19.391
If you don't see that, then
the normal condition is not met

00:03:19.391 --> 00:03:21.987
and the statements you make
about your confidence interval

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:24.737
aren't necessarily going to be as valid.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.296
The last thing we wanna really make sure

00:03:27.296 --> 00:03:30.080
is known as the independence condition.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.997
Independence condition.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.703
And this is the 10% rule.

00:03:35.703 --> 00:03:38.161
If we are sampling without replacement,

00:03:38.161 --> 00:03:39.796
and sometimes it's hard to do replacement.

00:03:39.796 --> 00:03:41.859
If you're surveying people who are exiting

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.265
a store, for example,

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:45.577
you can't ask them to
go back into the store

00:03:45.577 --> 00:03:48.548
or it might be very awkward to
ask to go back in the store.

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:51.618
And so the independence condition
is that your sample size,

00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:54.035
so sample, let me just say n,

00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:58.898
n is less than 10% of the population size.

00:04:00.162 --> 00:04:03.896
And so let's say your
population were 100,000 people.

00:04:03.896 --> 00:04:05.744
If you surveyed 1,000 people,

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:07.746
well, that was 1% of the population

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:09.116
so you'd feel pretty good

00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:11.231
that the independence condition is met.

00:04:11.231 --> 00:04:14.068
And once again, this is
valuable when you are sampling

00:04:14.068 --> 00:04:15.599
without replacement.

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.754
Now, to appreciate how
our confidence intervals

00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:20.688
don't do what we think they're gonna do

00:04:20.688 --> 00:04:22.635
when any of these things are broken,

00:04:22.635 --> 00:04:24.130
and I'll focus on these latter two.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.911
The random sample condition,

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:28.490
that's super important
frankly in all of statistics.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.151
So let's first look at a situation where

00:04:30.151 --> 00:04:33.685
independence condition breaks down.

00:04:33.685 --> 00:04:35.553
So right over here,

00:04:35.553 --> 00:04:38.789
you can see that we are using
our little gumball simulation.

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.283
And in that gumball simulation,

00:04:40.283 --> 00:04:41.990
we have a true population proportion,

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.789
but someone doing these
samples might not know that.

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.490
We're trying to construct
confidence interval

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.194
with 95% confidence level.

00:04:50.194 --> 00:04:52.609
And what we've set up here
is we aren't replacing.

00:04:52.609 --> 00:04:54.031
So every member of our sample,

00:04:54.031 --> 00:04:56.507
we're not looking at it
and putting it back in.

00:04:56.507 --> 00:04:57.996
We're just gonna take a sample of 200.

00:04:57.996 --> 00:05:00.195
And I've set up the
population so that it's a

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:02.916
far larger than 10% of the population.

00:05:02.916 --> 00:05:05.402
And then when I drew a bunch of samples,

00:05:05.402 --> 00:05:07.064
so this is a situation where I did

00:05:07.064 --> 00:05:10.978
almost 1500 samples here of size 200,

00:05:10.978 --> 00:05:12.649
what you can see here is

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:17.422
the situations where our
true population parameter

00:05:17.422 --> 00:05:20.062
was contained in the confidence interval

00:05:20.062 --> 00:05:22.540
that we calculated for that sample.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.571
And then you see in red
the ones where it's not.

00:05:24.571 --> 00:05:28.122
And as you can see, we are
only having a hit so to speak.

00:05:28.122 --> 00:05:30.289
The overlap between
the confidence interval

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.858
that we're calculating in
the true population parameter

00:05:32.858 --> 00:05:35.305
is happening about 93% of the time.

00:05:35.305 --> 00:05:38.121
And this is a pretty
large number of samples.

00:05:38.121 --> 00:05:40.591
If it's truly at a 95% confidence level,

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:43.761
this should be happening 95% of the time.

00:05:43.761 --> 00:05:45.733
Similarly, we can look at a situation

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:48.303
where our normal condition breaks down.

00:05:48.303 --> 00:05:49.743
And our normal condition,

00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:53.440
we can see here that our
sample size (mumbles) is 15.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.846
Actually, if I scroll down a little bit,

00:05:55.846 --> 00:05:57.958
you can see that the
simulation even worries me.

00:05:57.958 --> 00:06:00.798
There are fewer than
10 expected successes.

00:06:00.798 --> 00:06:01.797
And you can see that when I do,

00:06:01.797 --> 00:06:03.673
once again I did a bunch of samples here.

00:06:03.673 --> 00:06:05.816
I did over 2,000 samples.

00:06:05.816 --> 00:06:08.649
Even though I'm trying to set
up these confidence intervals

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:12.991
that every time I compute
it, that I've overtime,

00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:16.114
that there's kind of a
95% hit rate so to speak,

00:06:16.114 --> 00:06:17.831
here's only a 94% hit rate.

00:06:17.831 --> 00:06:19.828
And I've done a lot of samples here.

00:06:19.828 --> 00:06:21.397
And so the big takeaway,

00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:23.708
not being random will really skew things,

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:24.990
but if you don't feel good about

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.314
how normal the actual
sampling distribution

00:06:27.314 --> 00:06:28.989
of the sample proportions are

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:32.239
or if your sample size
is a fairly large chunk

00:06:32.239 --> 00:06:34.704
of your population and
you're not replacing

00:06:34.704 --> 00:06:36.753
and you're violating the
independence condition,

00:06:36.753 --> 00:06:37.736
then your confidence level

00:06:37.736 --> 00:06:39.200
that you think you're computing for

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.862
when you make your confidence
intervals might not be valid.
