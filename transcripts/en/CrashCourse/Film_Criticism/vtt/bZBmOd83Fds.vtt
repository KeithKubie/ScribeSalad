00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.840
Mainstream American films don’t often tackle
race and racism head-on, and when they do,

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.110
they often end up trying to find easy answers.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.710
Which makes films like Spike Lee’s Do the
Right Thing all the more powerful.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.019
It’s an intimate portrait of a Brooklyn
neighborhood, with a vibrant, intergenerational,

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.380
multi-ethnic community.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.119
But it also has an explosive climax, fueled
by racial resentments, economic anxiety, and

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.480
rising tensions on the hottest day of the
year.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.300
Lee uses an incredible array of filmmaking
techniques to make audiences think and engage.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.960
And the issues he’s wrestling with are still
very much alive today, more than 25 years later.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:49.640
[intro music plays]

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.450
Do the Right Thing burst onto screens in 1989,

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.390
after electrifying audiences and polarizing
critics at the Cannes Film Festival.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.480
At the time, writer-director Spike Lee was
just 32 and had made only two feature films

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.680
– the sly, sexy She’s Gotta Have It and
School Daze, a comedy set at an all-black

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.680
Southern college.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.130
Lee began conceiving Do the Right Thing with
his cinematographer Ernest Dickerson as they

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.670
were finishing work on School Daze.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.950
He was partially inspired by an incident in
1986 in which Michael Griffith, a 23-year-old

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.240
African-American, was beaten up and chased
from an Italian-American pizzeria, only to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.119
be killed by an oncoming car.

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.840
Having grown up in Brooklyn, steeped in the
complex lives and racial politics of its residents,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.520
Lee wanted to make a film that captured that
world.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.590
The story of Do the Right Thing takes place
almost completely over one blistering day

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.539
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood of Brooklyn.

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:41.810
Rather than following one traditional protagonist,
this film follows a variety of characters

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.539
as they try to beat the heat, make a living,
take a stand, or just get by.

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.399
It’s a film about community.

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.560
Spike Lee plays Mookie, a young African-American
man who delivers pizzas for Sal’s Famous

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.159
Pizzeria, a neighborhood hangout.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.760
And it’s through Mookie and the restaurant
that we’re introduced to most of the other characters.

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.480
There’s Sal himself, a proud Italian-American
played by Danny Aiello.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.460
He works with his two sons, the aggressive
Pino, played by John Turturro, and the more

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.619
passive Vito, played by Richard Edson.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.340
Then there’s Da Mayor, played by the legendary
Ossie Davis, a kind of elder statesman and

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.690
alcoholic who wanders the streets trying to
keep the peace.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.890
Mirroring that, there’s Mother Sister – played
by Ruby Dee, Davis’s real-life wife – who

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.000
keeps a watchful eye on the neighborhood from
her open apartment window.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.480
Mookie runs into friends throughout the day,
from Giancarlo Esposito’s politically outspoken

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.570
Buggin’ Out, to Bill Nunn’s Radio Raheem,
who carries around the world’s biggest ghetto-blaster,

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.200
cranking Public Enemy’s hip-hop anthem “Fight
the Power.”

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.640
Woven through the story is Smiley, a developmentally
delayed man played by Roger Guenveur Smith,

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.410
who makes a few dollars here and there
selling a photo of Malcolm X and Dr. Martin

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.410
Luther King, Jr.

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.570
And overlooking the whole thing is a smooth-voiced
radio DJ played by Samuel L. Jackson.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.710
He not only spins tunes, but also watches
the day unfold from his window, calling out

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.570
to characters as they pass his studio.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.200
Beyond the Italian-American and African-American
characters, there’s a grocery store run

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.220
by a Korean couple, a group of Latino kids,
and Mookie’s girlfriend Tina, played by

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.220
Rosie Perez.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.170
There’s also one white yuppie, who signifies
the coming gentrification of the neighborhood.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.480
And, finally, a pair of white New York City
policemen patrol the streets in a squad car.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.870
All of these characters and their plots keep
interweaving throughout the day, leading to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.640
a climactic showdown that ends with a riot,
Radio Raheem dead from a police chokehold,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.920
Sal’s Famous Pizzeria in flames, and everyone
trying to find a way forward.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.970
This film, like many films, is all about emotion
and visual communication.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.570
Lee, his cinematographer, and production designer
worked tirelessly to create a mood and the

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.320
sense of a ticking bomb.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.720
So looking at this film is a great way to
understand how cinema affects an audience.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.850
One of the things Lee does to ratchet the
tension and immerse us in this very specific

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.480
world is to emphasize how hot it is.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.790
And he uses all kinds of filmmaking techniques
to do it.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.690
Not only does the cinematography highlight
the blasting rays of the sun, but Lee had

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.130
production designer Wynn Thomas remove all
the blues and greens he could from the costumes,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.430
props, sets, and make-up.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.540
Instead, the film is a feast of warm colors:
vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.571
Lee and Dickerson even put heat lamps right
under the camera lens in some shots to produce

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:07.360
those wavy heat shimmers.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.390
Characters are routinely covered in sweat.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.220
Their clothes stick to their bodies.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.820
And their tempers are set on a hair trigger,
just waiting to be ignited.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.650
Lee mixes all kinds of filmmaking styles,
mirroring the way the block mixes cultural

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.650
identities.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.720
The movie begins with an heavily-stylized,
color-saturated dance sequence that plays

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.870
during the opening credits.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.100
In it, Rosie Perez dances alone to “Fight
the Power.”

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.170
This is the film asserting its agenda right
up front, both stylistic and musical.

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.120
It’s a challenge, but it’s also fun and
exciting, just like the rest of the film.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.160
Lee makes excellent use of wide tracking shots
as characters move from one part of the block

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.160
to another.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.210
These shots feel expansive and natural, and
yet they’re clearly highly choreographed.

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.310
He’ll have minor characters move through
the background or step in at the end of a

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.980
scene to redirect the story.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.600
That kind of meandering is actually really
hard to pull off, and the work here is seamless.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.660
It underlines the interconnectedness of the
film’s community.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.340
At other times, Lee and Dickerson will tilt
the camera 45 degrees in what’s often called

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.420
a Dutch or canted angle.

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.760
Suddenly, the horizon line isn’t flat and
the world feels unstable and off-kilter.

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.810
It’s almost as if the characters are in
danger of falling out of the screen because

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.420
their world is so off balance.

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:18.910
In one of the film’s most powerful sequences,
Lee even has his characters look directly

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.440
into the camera, breaking the fourth wall.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.740
And they unleash the most profane string of
ethnic and racial insults in the film.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.540
As the film critic Thomas Doherty writes in
Film Quarterly:

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.169
“The interethnic, interracial animosity
explodes in a montage of face-front slurs...that

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:36.470
serve as warm-ups for the ultimate bonfire.”

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.650
All this anger and resentment simmering below
the surface prepares us for the eruption that’s

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.650
about to come.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.370
It also adds another dimension to a film about
community.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.430
Because this community, however harmonious
it may seem, is deeply, perhaps irrevocably,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:50.430
fractured.

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.700
The film echoes this fracturing by shifting
tones and moods.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.090
Scenes will go from light-hearted and funny
to tense at the drop of a hat.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:01.860
In one sequence, kids from the neighborhood
open a fire hydrant and cool off in the spraying water.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.840
All the tensions dissolve for a while as people
start dragging their friends in to get soaked.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.120
It’s a glorious free-for-all!

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.610
And suddenly, this carefully-choreographed,
stylized film seems to take the approach of

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:12.610
a documentary.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:17.060
It’s as though Lee set the action in motion
and is just capturing it as it happens.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:19.870
The freedom of the camera mirrors the freedom
of the characters.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:24.110
Then, a middle-aged Italian-American drives
a beautifully-maintained convertible up the

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.110
street.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.840
He threatens the kids not to spray him as
he passes.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.320
And not in a nice way, either!

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.610
As the insults fly back and forth, and the
tension returns, Lee and Dickerson lock their

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:34.820
camera down again.

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:39.070
And sure enough, when the man drives past
the hydrant, the kids turn the water loose,

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.940
dousing both him and the car.

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.400
The man storms out of his car, the kids run,
and the cops show up, shutting off the hydrant,

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.400
and ending the fun.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.560
The shifting moods of Do the Right Thing are
a large part of its power.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.170
The film keeps us unsure about which encounters
are going to lead to trouble and which ones

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:54.280
are going to end in humor.

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.240
In the lighter moments, we empathize with
the community.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.870
We don’t want to see it torn apart.

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.770
At one point, Radio Raheem faces off against
a group of Latino kids who are playing their

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.110
own music from a slightly smaller boom box.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.560
When Radio Raheem cranks his volume to the
max, the other kids nod sheepishly, conceding

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.710
that Radio Raheem’s speakers can’t be
beat.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.510
And this moment is more than just a funny
gag.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.770
That ghetto blaster means something.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:18.449
When Radio Raheem cranks it up, he’s not
only demonstrating his machine’s power,

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.670
he’s also asserting his cultural identity
and the coming dominance of hip-hop.

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.710
And in fact, the final confrontation that
ends with Radio Raheem’s death and the destruction

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:30.710
of the pizzeria escalates when Sal demands
Radio Raheem turn down his music.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:34.850
This time, instead of ending with a laugh,
Lee flips the script and has Sal smash the

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.370
ghetto blaster to bits, bringing on the killing
and the riot.

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.889
Critics and scholars have been debating the
film and its ultimate stance on race and racism

00:07:41.889 --> 00:07:42.890
since it was released.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:47.620
Film critic David Denby initially labeled
the film incoherent and irresponsible.

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:51.770
Political columnist Joe Klein even warned
that the movie might spark actual riots.

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.870
Roger Ebert, on the other hand, strongly disagreed,
writing:

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:58.639
“Thoughtless people have accused Lee … of
being an angry filmmaker.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:02.080
He has much to be angry about, but I don't
find it in his work.

00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.140
The wonder of “Do the Right Thing” is
that he is so fair.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:08.650
Those who found this film an incitement to
violence are saying much about themselves,

00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:10.230
and nothing useful about the movie.

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:14.009
Whatever its stance, Do the Right
Thing is an unapologetically political film.

00:08:14.009 --> 00:08:18.419
It wrestles very explicitly with two strands
of black activism, and what those two approaches

00:08:18.419 --> 00:08:20.169
mean for the community as a whole.

00:08:20.169 --> 00:08:24.800
There’s peaceful direct action, as advocated
by Martin Luther King, Jr., and a more militant

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.980
strain, most often associated with Malcolm
X.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.800
The film presents us with characters on all
sides of this divide, from Buggin’ Out,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.789
who tries to organize a boycott of Sal’s
pizzeria, to Mookie, who just wants to get

00:08:34.789 --> 00:08:36.310
through his day and get paid.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:40.039
Outside of the black community, we have everything
from the obvious racial antagonism of the

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:44.580
Italian-American in his convertible, to Sal,
who begins the film with a kind gesture toward

00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:47.320
Da Mayor, despite the objections of his own
son, Pino.

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.260
By the end of the film, though, Sal is revealed
to be a much less sympathetic character.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.640
His stubborn refusal to add photos of African-Americans
to his “Wall of Fame” and his destruction

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.760
of Radio Raheem’s boom box led directly
to violence.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:04.150
Not only that, but Sal destroys the boom box
with a worn baseball bat, itself a heavy

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:08.610
symbol of violence against African-Americans,
including in the incident with Michael Griffith.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:12.490
Some scholars point to this character as key
to Spike Lee’s strategy for engaging with

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.580
white audiences, especially when he’s tackling
racism.

00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:19.590
In the journal Thinking Through Cinema: Film
as Philosophy, Dan Flory writes:

00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.740
“Lee depicts sympathetic racist characters
so that viewers may initially forge positive

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:29.990
allegiances with them in spite of those characters’
anti-black beliefs and actions, which in earlier

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:33.970
stages of the narrative seem trivial ... or
may even go unnoticed.

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.140
He then alienates viewers from such characters
by revealing the harmfulness of these typically

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.839
white beliefs and actions.”

00:09:39.839 --> 00:09:44.100
In other words, Lee’s choice to make Sal
sympathetic early in the film forces non-black

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.830
audiences to confront their own, perhaps deeply
buried, notions of race and racism – especially

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:54.160
as the story reaches its boiling point, and
Sal is revealed to be a much more harmful

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.160
character.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.050
During the film’s climax, Mookie finds himself
sharing a shot with Sal and his sons as they

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.860
face down Buggin’ Out, Radio Raheem, and
Smiley.

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.730
He’s on one side of the divide.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.730
Only after Radio Raheem has been killed by
the police does he signal that he’s had

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.490
enough, crossing the street, emptying a garbage
can, and then hurling it through the window

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:13.490
of Sal’s restaurant.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.149
Did Mookie do the right thing?

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:19.420
A more traditional film about race may have
ended there, suggesting triumph in his revenge.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.940
But Spike Lee isn’t interested in declaring
right and wrong.

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:25.450
Remember, he’s making a film about a community.

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:30.080
And that community has to get up the next
day, sweep up the ashes, and find a way to

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.350
move forward.

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.610
And that’s exactly what happens.

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:38.640
It’s an uneasy ending, not traditionally
satisfying, but it feels very real and immediate.

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:42.550
These same difficult conversations about race,
violence, and community are as relevant to

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.070
our society today as they have ever been.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.970
For Mookie, Sal, Spike Lee, and the rest of
us, the struggle continues.

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:51.430
Next time, we’ll look at Lost in Translation.

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:55.630
It’s a quieter, more contemplative film
about a lost young woman who strikes up a

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:59.260
friendship with an older, fading movie star
in contemporary Japan.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.400

association with PBS Digital Studios.
