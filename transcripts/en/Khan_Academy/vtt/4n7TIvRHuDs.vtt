00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.759
I have a piecewise defined function here,
and my goal is to figure out its domain

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.099
and its range. So first let's think about the
domain.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.990
And just a bit overview, the domain is
the set of all inputs

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.440
for which our function is defined. 
And over here, an input variable

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.480
is x, so to think about, it's the set of all
the values that x can take on,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.359
and actually have this function be defined,
and actually figure out what f of x is.

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.050
And when we look at this, we see, okay, if 0 is
less than x is less than or equal to 2. We're

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.250
in this clause, it's x crosses 2 and it is greater than 2.
We follow this clause

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.700
As we approach 6 but right when we get
to 6, we fall into this clause right over here,

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.719
all the way up to and including 11. 
But if we get larger than 11, the function is

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.870
no longer defined. I don't know which of
these to use.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.390
And if we're 0 or less, the function is
longer defined as well.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.750
So in order for this to be defined, x has
to be greater than 0 or if we say 0 is less

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.449
than x,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.700
and you see that part right over there.
And x has to be less than or equal to 11.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.340
and x has to be less then or equal to 11.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.890
It's defined for everything in between. 
As we, as we see, once again,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.290
as we get to 2, we're here.
As we cross 2, between 2 and 6, we're

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.180
here, and at 6, from 6 to 11 we're

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.630
over here. So we're defined for all real
numbers in this interval. So our domain is --

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.009
actually let me write this all, all

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.340
real values, are all real

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.030
all real values. maybe --

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.290
Let me write that way.  All real value such
that, such

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.380
that, 0 is less than x, is less than
or equal to 11.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.939
So now think about the range.
Let's think about

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.040
the range of this piecewise
defined function.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.040
And that's a set of all values that this
function can actually take on.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.530
and this one is, is maybe deceptively
simple because there're only three values

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.979
that this function can take on.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.479
You can take on, f of x can be equal to
1. It can be equal to 5,

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.159
or it could be equal to negative 7.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.439
So the range here, we could say that f of x

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:08.869
needs to be a member of, 
this is just a fancy

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.300
mathy symbol, just to say this is a member of the set

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.730
1, 5, negative 7. f of x is going to take,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.930
is going to take on one of these three
values. Another way to say it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.379
is that f of x is going to be equal 1,

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.400
5 or negative 7. This is maybe a little

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.640
less -- a little -- a less

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.040
a less mathy way, a less precise way

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.720
of saying the same thing. But one way
or another, f of x can only take on

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.879
one over these three values.
