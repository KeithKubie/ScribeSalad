00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:04.634
Schalk: Okay, cool.
Anyway, welcome.

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:07.067
Sorry we have
a slightly late start.

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:10.033
We're actually attempting
something that I think is

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:11.734
quite aggressive.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.801
So we have a star-studded panel
here.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.667
Let me introduce myself
very quickly,

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:17.767
and then I'm gonna hand the mic
down to our panelists here

00:00:17.767 --> 00:00:19.367
and just do some quick
introductions.

00:00:19.367 --> 00:00:21.634
And then I have
a few intro slides,

00:00:21.634 --> 00:00:23.400
and then we'll get into
a bunch of demos, okay?

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.834
So my name is Chris Schalk.

00:00:25.834 --> 00:00:27.267
I'm a Google developer
advocate.

00:00:27.267 --> 00:00:29.667
And, essentially, I work
with OpenSocial.

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:32.534
And because my past is a bit
of an Enterprise past,

00:00:32.534 --> 00:00:34.234
I have a special feeling
for those out

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:35.734
in the Enterprise community.

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.901
And I've been having numerous
discussions with these guys

00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:41.734
for a long time now
on how we can, essentially,

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.934
make OpenSocial work
in the Enterprise.

00:00:43.934 --> 00:00:45.901
And so that's, essentially,
the goal of this talk.

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:47.834
So let me go ahead
and hand the microphone over

00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:49.400
to our star-studded panel here,

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.000
and they can introduce
themselves.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.534
Carroll: Hi, my name is
Dave Carroll.

00:00:53.534 --> 00:00:58.200
I'm a technical evangelist
for salesforce.com.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.834
Mayerhofer: Hi, I'm
John Mayerhofer,

00:00:59.834 --> 00:01:03.667
and I run the business
standards team at SAP.

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.567
Grall: I'm Tug Grall,
and I'm responsible

00:01:05.567 --> 00:01:09.167
for the product strategy
on eXo Platform.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:10.334
Brookes:
Mike Cannon Brookes.

00:01:10.334 --> 00:01:13.868
I'm the co-founder
and co-CEO of Atlassian.

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:16.934
Manalang: Rich Manalang,
and I work for Oracle.

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:19.567
I'm part of the product
strategy team in Oracle

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:23.934
that looks after
social networking.

00:01:23.934 --> 00:01:25.734
Weitzel: Mark Weitzel,
from IBM.

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:29.400
Part of the emerging
standing team at IBM.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.067
Schalk: And you can hold onto
the mic, I think, for now.

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:33.868
So anyway,
before we get started,

00:01:33.868 --> 00:01:38.200
also, we do have
a Google moderator page.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.234
The URL is actually quite long,
so I created a bit.ly URL.

00:01:42.234 --> 00:01:44.901
so bit.ly/enterpriseopensocial.

00:01:44.901 --> 00:01:47.200
So feel free.
Toss out any questions

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.868
you think are relevant.

00:01:48.868 --> 00:01:50.701
And we'll be spending
a considerable amount of time

00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.100
in the second half
of our presentation

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.767
just, you know,
working with your questions.

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:56.467
Okay?

00:01:56.467 --> 00:01:58.400
Now, as I mentioned before,
that's our agenda.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.601
It's fairly straightforward.

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:01.701
I'm gonna provide
a very quick overview

00:02:01.701 --> 00:02:04.000
for any people who are new
to OpenSocial.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.601
I just want to make sure that
everyone's kind of

00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:06.701
on the same page.

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:08.200
Actually, a real quick show
of hands.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.300
How many people are not really
familiar with OpenSocial yet?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.701
Okay, so that's good.

00:02:13.701 --> 00:02:16.534
I'm at least providing you
a bit of a starting point.

00:02:16.534 --> 00:02:19.767
Okay...so let's just jump
right into it.

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:21.367
What is OpenSocial?

00:02:21.367 --> 00:02:24.701
Well, it's essentially a set
of APIs that allow you

00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:26.267
to build social applications.

00:02:26.267 --> 00:02:28.067
And these APIs are standard.

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.567
So what that means is that
it's not one company or,

00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:32.501
you know, one particular
technology.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:34.634
These standards have been
brought together

00:02:34.634 --> 00:02:37.968
by a set of companies
that have been collaborating.

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:39.767
And they've been working,
essentially, since...

00:02:39.767 --> 00:02:42.634
almost, like, two years now.

00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:46.634
So very quickly, what are
the benefits of OpenSocial?

00:02:46.634 --> 00:02:49.200
Well, as you can see here,
before OpenSocial,

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.200
if you wanted to build
an application

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.734
that had social features,

00:02:52.734 --> 00:02:54.267
and you wanted to take
your application

00:02:54.267 --> 00:02:56.367
and put it into
different networks,

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:57.367
it was a bit of a challenge.

00:02:57.367 --> 00:02:58.767
You really couldn't do that.

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:02.667
So as you can see here, our
Joe Developer is not too happy.

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:06.868
But now, with OpenSocial,
that was launched back in 2007,

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:08.734
there's, essentially,
a set of standards

00:03:08.734 --> 00:03:10.400
for building
social applications.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.667
And these standards revolve
around three core areas.

00:03:13.667 --> 00:03:16.467
So friends, profiles,
activities.

00:03:16.467 --> 00:03:20.133
And so, basically, once these
standards have been launched,

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:24.067
this allows for
standardization

00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:25.934
of social application
development

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:29.434
across any, what we refer to
as container sites,

00:03:29.434 --> 00:03:31.200
or Enterprise companies, for
that matter,

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.400
that have the ability to,
you know, adopt these standards.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.901
Then they can essentially run
the same applications

00:03:36.901 --> 00:03:38.701
and the same technology.

00:03:38.701 --> 00:03:40.901
So this guy's much happier.

00:03:40.901 --> 00:03:43.968
I should also say
who owns OpenSocial?

00:03:43.968 --> 00:03:45.334
Is it Google?

00:03:45.334 --> 00:03:47.634
Do you guys think that's true?

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.267
You may think so,
but it's not.

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:51.834
It's actually run by
the OpenSocial organization.

00:03:51.834 --> 00:03:55.000
And true, Google did
kind of spearhead

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.968
these initial set of standards
early off.

00:03:57.968 --> 00:04:01.167
Google did donate
a substantial amount of code,

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:04.033
especially when you get into,
like, Gadget, and so forth.

00:04:04.033 --> 00:04:05.400
Gadget Rendering
and things like that.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.133
But it's now essentially managed
under the auspices

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:11.667
of the OpenSocial Foundation.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:13.300
So if you really want
to have, like,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.167
a high-level starting point
to learn about OpenSocial,

00:04:16.167 --> 00:04:19.100
you can just go to
www.opensocial.org.

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.334
And from then on
you can start to get

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:25.000
a nice, high-level view
of what exactly OpenSocial is.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.200
Who's using it?

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.868
Well, we have, like,
a number of partners.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.868
We have millions of end users
around the world globally.

00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:32.801
I've been personally involved
in reaching out

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.567
to a lot of different companies
in India and Japan and Korea.

00:04:35.567 --> 00:04:39.701
And to be honest, it's been
a real pleasurable experience.

00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.467
Just to be able to share
this technology

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:44.467
and the adoption rate
with our partners

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:46.501
is quite substantial.

00:04:46.501 --> 00:04:49.133
And they really jump on
to the technology.

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:54.934
This is a latest-number chart
that basically shows, you know,

00:04:54.934 --> 00:04:58.634
over 800 million end users
are now being able to use

00:04:58.634 --> 00:05:00.200
OpenSocial technology

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.634
in a number of different
web sites and--

00:05:03.634 --> 00:05:05.300
Well, we refer to them
as container sites.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.434
So just to kind of give you
an idea of the breadth,

00:05:07.434 --> 00:05:11.534
or the overall volume
of the OpenSocial users

00:05:11.534 --> 00:05:12.834
is quite substantial.

00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:16.767
The overall volume of
OpenSocial developers, globally,

00:05:16.767 --> 00:05:19.234
is also in the thousands
as well.

00:05:19.234 --> 00:05:21.367
So it's serious technology.

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:22.868
I don't want to take up
too much time,

00:05:22.868 --> 00:05:24.434
but a few main points.

00:05:24.434 --> 00:05:26.667
It was launched
back in 2007.

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:31.767
We very quickly evolved
from version 0.5, 6, 7.

00:05:31.767 --> 00:05:34.534
We had some new containers
launched, like MySpace, hi5

00:05:34.534 --> 00:05:36.300
early in the day.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.334
And then, I think, another thing
that I'd like to point out

00:05:38.334 --> 00:05:41.334
on this slide is that
version 0.8, last year,

00:05:41.334 --> 00:05:44.534
that came out came with
essentially restful APIs.

00:05:44.534 --> 00:05:46.601
So what that actually did is
that opened up the door

00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.701
to other service site
entities

00:05:48.701 --> 00:05:50.567
to allow for two-way
communication.

00:05:50.567 --> 00:05:54.701
So essentially, transfer
of social data became possible.

00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.000
And that is, essentially,
one of the key things

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.133
that a lot of our Enterprise
partners are looking to

00:05:59.133 --> 00:06:00.601
take advantage of.

00:06:00.601 --> 00:06:03.000
And here we are--
we've already passed

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.200
our one-year milestone.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.300
We have, you know,
well over 600 now.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:08.634
And we're now looking
at 0.9 now

00:06:08.634 --> 00:06:12.934
as the current version
of the API.

00:06:12.934 --> 00:06:15.234
So why are we doing
this session?

00:06:15.234 --> 00:06:19.400
Because personally I feel,
and all of my partners feel

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.734
it's too important to ignore
the Enterprise

00:06:22.734 --> 00:06:25.234
when you're referring
to social technology.

00:06:25.234 --> 00:06:30.000
So we feel that the core
concepts of people collaboration

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.734
is vitally important.

00:06:32.734 --> 00:06:35.534
And by using standard
technologies,

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:39.901
we all feel very strongly
that there is a justification

00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:41.467
for exploring this area.

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:43.234
Are we there yet?
Not yet.

00:06:43.234 --> 00:06:45.067
We're still working.
There's a lot of prototypes.

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:46.234
A lot of cool technology.

00:06:46.234 --> 00:06:48.234
But do people equally--

00:06:48.234 --> 00:06:51.334
Do people, like, equate
OpenSocial and Enterprise today?

00:06:51.334 --> 00:06:53.000
I wouldn't say that yet.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.067
But that's hopefully what we're
trying to do is kick this off.

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:59.434
Hopefully get some buzz started
and see what you guys think.

00:06:59.434 --> 00:07:01.534
So basically,
we want to educate, brainstorm,

00:07:01.534 --> 00:07:03.567
and share what we have today.

00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:07.367
So with that, I'm gonna
go ahead and kinda jump into--

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:09.367
'cause I want to make sure
we have enough time--

00:07:09.367 --> 00:07:11.501
is to our first set
of demos.

00:07:11.501 --> 00:07:13.734
And so I believe
we have Mark Weitzel,

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:19.033
who's gonna come up and show us
what IBM has got in the works.

00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:22.667
I'll just...

00:07:22.667 --> 00:07:24.100
Oh, the switch.

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.100
And on number one, right?

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.300
Are you on four?
Weitzel: Four.

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.901
Schalk: Okay.

00:07:29.901 --> 00:07:31.701
Weitzel: Thank you.

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.501
One of the things
that I'm gonna show now is

00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:37.167
some work that we're doing
as part of my team

00:07:37.167 --> 00:07:41.234
in the emerging standards--
the emerging technology group.

00:07:41.234 --> 00:07:44.667
I've got a pretty good gig
because I get to play around

00:07:44.667 --> 00:07:46.601
with a lot of the things
that are forthcoming.

00:07:46.601 --> 00:07:49.934
I get to work with
our product teams.

00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:53.934
And early on, IBM has been
looking at mashup technology--

00:07:53.934 --> 00:07:55.801
situational-app technology
for a while.

00:07:55.801 --> 00:07:58.267
And we have a number of products
that deal with

00:07:58.267 --> 00:08:01.834
this kind of mashups,
and also collaboration.

00:08:01.834 --> 00:08:04.767
And so OpenSocial, as we start
to get involved in this,

00:08:04.767 --> 00:08:08.467
is very interesting to IBM
for a number of those reasons.

00:08:08.467 --> 00:08:11.000
What I'll be showing today
is some early

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.667
proof of concept-type work
that we're doing

00:08:13.667 --> 00:08:15.334
with one of our Lotus teams.

00:08:15.334 --> 00:08:17.667
The Lotus Mashup Maker team.

00:08:17.667 --> 00:08:26.367
And I'll show what we have here
here is...not that.

00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:29.701
Now, let's see here.

00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:31.000
Schalk: You'll have to go easy
on us

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.667
because we have a fairly
elaborate setup.

00:08:32.667 --> 00:08:37.667
Weitzel: No, I need this icon
that got moved around.

00:08:37.667 --> 00:08:41.234
Uh, everything is small.

00:08:41.234 --> 00:08:44.334
So this is our
IBM Mashup Center.

00:08:44.334 --> 00:08:49.000
And one of the things that we've
been doing inside of IBM

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.801
is working with Gadgets
and Widgets for a while.

00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:57.000
Unfortunately, at this time
they're not OpenSocial gadgets.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.467
We have a specification that
we've been working on internally

00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:02.934
because we've been doing this
for a number of years.

00:09:02.934 --> 00:09:05.367
And we've been working also
with an open foundation--

00:09:05.367 --> 00:09:09.300
the OpenAJAX Foundation--
trying to get metadata

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.267
and Widget/Gadget technology
interoperable.

00:09:13.267 --> 00:09:18.334
So what I'm actually gonna
show here is a demo

00:09:18.334 --> 00:09:22.367
of our Mashup Center.

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:23.901
Schalk: You want me to hold
the mic?

00:09:23.901 --> 00:09:29.801
Weitzel: No, I got it.
Schalk: Okay.

00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:32.367
Weitzel: And the sizing might be
a little off here,

00:09:32.367 --> 00:09:36.033
but what we'll look at is--
this is our Mashup Center.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:38.968
And we've created
a little bit

00:09:38.968 --> 00:09:42.000
of a very straightforward demo
that talks about

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.267
how you can assemble
these Mashup pages.

00:09:45.267 --> 00:09:47.400
And one of the things
that we can do

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:53.234
inside of our Mashup product
is eventing back and forth,

00:09:53.234 --> 00:09:55.000
like you can do in OpenSocial.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.701
We externalize those
to have wiring

00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:01.901
that you can use declaratively
in things like Tools,

00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:04.968
which we think is
an important way

00:10:04.968 --> 00:10:06.334
to get consumability.

00:10:06.334 --> 00:10:09.601
So I have
a very simple demo here,

00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:11.334
where you can take
a random number

00:10:11.334 --> 00:10:12.767
and you can publish it.

00:10:12.767 --> 00:10:17.834
But I can go into this page,
into edit mode...here,

00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:23.801
and I can then drop down
and select, maybe...

00:10:27.434 --> 00:10:31.567
maybe not...
some OpenSocial gadgets.

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:33.000
Now you gotta hold the mic.
Schalk: Here you go.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.400
Weitzel: Let me see
what I can do here.

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.601
Let's see...

00:10:38.601 --> 00:10:40.801
Schalk: That's the one.
Weitzel: Yeah.

00:10:40.801 --> 00:10:45.467
I'm gonna have to get this here.

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:48.901
Oh...well...

00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:53.567
Looks like I lost my, uh...

00:10:53.567 --> 00:10:56.601
Looks like we might need
to go to plan "B" here.

00:11:04.634 --> 00:11:08.767
That should not be there.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:12.200
Here we go.
There we go, all right.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:18.868
So now I've got the OpenSocial.

00:11:18.868 --> 00:11:21.000
Where'd that guy go?

00:11:27.367 --> 00:11:30.868
So there's one of my OpenSocial
widgets that I've grabbed

00:11:30.868 --> 00:11:33.300
that will do the subscription.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:38.100
And I'll grab another one here
that will do the publish.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.901
And I can just drag those on.

00:11:40.901 --> 00:11:44.801
And I can resize these
and move 'em around.

00:11:44.801 --> 00:11:47.667
So now when I don something
like a subscribe here,

00:11:47.667 --> 00:11:49.734
I can publish this.

00:11:49.734 --> 00:11:53.300
This is being published
from an OpenSocial gadget.

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:56.834
And this is being published
from one of our internal gadgets

00:11:56.834 --> 00:12:00.367
using technology from OpenAJAX
called the OpenAJAX hub.

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:03.000
We can talk more about that,
maybe, in the Q&amp;A.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.100
The important thing from us is
this gives us a way

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:08.467
to take some of our existing
work that we've done,

00:12:08.467 --> 00:12:10.100
some of our existing products,

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.467
and start to bring some
of the OpenSocial technologies

00:12:12.467 --> 00:12:14.367
into these things

00:12:14.367 --> 00:12:17.133
and have them coexist
peacefully together.

00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:20.501
And it also allows
the consumers

00:12:20.501 --> 00:12:22.767
to be able to easily
bring these things together

00:12:22.767 --> 00:12:24.200
and create these pages.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.133
The last thing that
we want to look at is--

00:12:27.133 --> 00:12:30.100
I talked a little bit about
the eventing here.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.767
This is being able to read
some of the externalized events

00:12:33.767 --> 00:12:35.400
in the metadata
that's available

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.634
in something like
an OpenAJAX widget.

00:12:38.634 --> 00:12:40.968
And one of the things
that we're interested in is

00:12:40.968 --> 00:12:45.067
if we're gonna do these complex,
consumable mashups,

00:12:45.067 --> 00:12:47.367
we'd like to have
the same kinds of things

00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:48.601
in OpenSocial.

00:12:48.601 --> 00:12:50.000
And you can see now
that we don't have that.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.767
So the kind of extensions
to externalize that information

00:12:53.767 --> 00:12:55.100
is one of the things we're
interested in

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:57.167
working together on
and finding out

00:12:57.167 --> 00:12:59.400
from the rest of the group here

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:01.334
what sorts of things
they'd like to see.

00:13:01.334 --> 00:13:04.767
So with that being
seven minutes into it,

00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:07.334
I'll turn it over to, uh...

00:13:07.334 --> 00:13:08.367
Schalk: Well, thank you
very much, Mark.

00:13:08.367 --> 00:13:09.901
Weitzel: Sure.

00:13:09.901 --> 00:13:11.267
Schalk: Yeah, we're definitely
looking forward to seeing

00:13:11.267 --> 00:13:13.334
what more innovations that
you guys are coming up with.

00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:15.200
So anyway, thanks a lot, Mark.
Weitzel: Okay.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.100
Schalk: Come on up.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.200
Rich, from Oracle,
is gonna show us

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.601
a cool demo as well.

00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:22.000
Manalang: Hello.
Schalk: What number again?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.968
Oh, you're number two.
Manalang: Two. Okay.

00:13:24.968 --> 00:13:28.501
So I'm gonna go through
a real fast speed demo here.

00:13:28.501 --> 00:13:29.901
Schalk: And if you have
questions about each demo,

00:13:29.901 --> 00:13:31.667
feel free to enter 'em
in the moderator page as well.

00:13:31.667 --> 00:13:32.934
We can--We could take it
at that point.

00:13:32.934 --> 00:13:33.968
So go for it.

00:13:33.968 --> 00:13:35.601
Manalang: So the history
behind Oracle

00:13:35.601 --> 00:13:40.300
and its involvement in...

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:42.467
...internal social network
within Oracle

00:13:42.467 --> 00:13:47.100
just as kind of a Skunk Works
kind of development effort

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:51.067
to try and test out some of
the interesting things happening

00:13:51.067 --> 00:13:53.067
with things like Facebook
and MySpace,

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:54.834
and bringing it into a firewall.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.767
So we built this thing
called Connect--Oracle Connect.

00:13:57.767 --> 00:13:59.067
And basically it's a--

00:13:59.067 --> 00:14:01.601
This is basically, I think,
the fourth revision--

00:14:01.601 --> 00:14:02.834
fourth version.

00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:05.000
And we have an Oracle person
out here--Oliver--

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.234
that's taking pictures
and posting them onto Connect

00:14:08.234 --> 00:14:09.567
as we talk here.

00:14:09.567 --> 00:14:12.267
But basically it's a...

00:14:12.267 --> 00:14:15.167
If you can think of, uh...

00:14:15.167 --> 00:14:18.234
man: I have a job.

00:14:18.234 --> 00:14:21.467
Manalang: If you can think of,
you know,

00:14:21.467 --> 00:14:23.734
Facebook and Twitter
and all the things

00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:28.667
that are happening
on the public web these days,

00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.067
and kind of mash it up
and try and figure out

00:14:31.067 --> 00:14:36.534
how that works...

00:14:36.534 --> 00:14:40.367
Um, and mash that up...

00:14:40.367 --> 00:14:42.534
And what we've done is
we've kind of taken

00:14:42.534 --> 00:14:44.601
all those pieces--
all the interesting pieces--

00:14:44.601 --> 00:14:48.567
and built a tool that would
allow people to share things

00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:50.501
inside Oracle.

00:14:50.501 --> 00:14:53.234
So here's what it is.

00:14:53.234 --> 00:14:55.667
Basically you have the ability
to do things

00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:58.901
like post your status on Note,
which is similar to a blog.

00:14:58.901 --> 00:15:03.534
Link--share links, ideas,
questions, and media,

00:15:03.534 --> 00:15:05.067
and also code.

00:15:05.067 --> 00:15:07.734
So you know, code is for
our developers

00:15:07.734 --> 00:15:11.067
who want to be able to, like,
share code out there

00:15:11.067 --> 00:15:14.968
that's similar to just posting
some piece of source code,

00:15:14.968 --> 00:15:16.968
and have people comment on it
and things.

00:15:16.968 --> 00:15:21.033
You have different views,
like a network activity

00:15:21.033 --> 00:15:23.334
or a group activity
and all the activity.

00:15:23.334 --> 00:15:26.968
You can comment.
You can like something.

00:15:26.968 --> 00:15:31.534
You can, you know, just go
through what people are doing.

00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:35.968
It's kind of a stream
of what's going on at Oracle.

00:15:35.968 --> 00:15:41.501
As well we have
a profile system

00:15:41.501 --> 00:15:43.334
that allows you--

00:15:43.334 --> 00:15:45.367
It's kind of like
a company directory as well.

00:15:45.367 --> 00:15:48.868
So if you take Facebook--
the elements of Facebook--

00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:50.634
where you can look
at someone's profile

00:15:50.634 --> 00:15:52.934
and see the information--
phone numbers and things.

00:15:52.934 --> 00:15:54.033
It's the same kind of thing.

00:15:54.033 --> 00:15:55.167
You can see a hierarchy.

00:15:55.167 --> 00:15:59.033
You can see how far down
I am from Larry Ellison.

00:15:59.033 --> 00:16:02.767
You can see a bio and, you know,
my status

00:16:02.767 --> 00:16:04.734
and groups I belong to
and tags.

00:16:04.734 --> 00:16:07.100
And then we also introduce
the notion of

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.701
what we call "Kudos."

00:16:08.701 --> 00:16:11.601
It's our version of the "Wall"
on Facebook.

00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:15.434
It's much more focused,
and our use cases for

00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:18.901
all the times when you had to
send out an email

00:16:18.901 --> 00:16:21.400
to someone you worked with,
or their manager,

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:25.667
to say thank you for, you know,
doing a great job

00:16:25.667 --> 00:16:27.434
on this particular project.

00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:30.501
So Kudos has been
a great little widget

00:16:30.501 --> 00:16:34.300
for us to be able to
put inside Connect

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.801
to encourage people
to thank each other

00:16:36.801 --> 00:16:38.834
for doing good work.

00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:40.801
And you can also see
people's network--

00:16:40.801 --> 00:16:42.234
who they're networked with,

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:46.434
contact information,
and location.

00:16:46.434 --> 00:16:50.467
So in terms of posting,
it's interesting.

00:16:50.467 --> 00:16:53.133
People can post
different types of things,

00:16:53.133 --> 00:16:54.367
like media.

00:16:54.367 --> 00:16:57.200
Um, there are some videos
in here, I think, that--

00:16:57.200 --> 00:17:02.234
We actually have a nice
filtering mechanism--

00:17:02.234 --> 00:17:03.667
dynamic filtering mechanism,

00:17:03.667 --> 00:17:06.968
so we can filter things
like source--where it came from.

00:17:06.968 --> 00:17:12.501
You know, we can sort by,
you know,

00:17:12.501 --> 00:17:14.767
what type of activity it is.

00:17:14.767 --> 00:17:17.901
If it's a status,
a question, an idea

00:17:17.901 --> 00:17:20.934
from a particular time period.

00:17:20.934 --> 00:17:24.534
It's sorted in different ways,
by freshness, popularity,

00:17:24.534 --> 00:17:26.767
whether it's recently active.

00:17:26.767 --> 00:17:29.767
So some of the things
people use to post--

00:17:29.767 --> 00:17:33.334
Like, there's people in here
posting things about Wave.

00:17:33.334 --> 00:17:36.801
There's video
that people have posted.

00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:40.434
So it's similar to, like,
a Twitter experience,

00:17:40.434 --> 00:17:43.667
but you can post
whatever you want.

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:47.968
And the other aspect of this
is, you can imagine,

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:51.334
you know, at Oracle, there's
80,000, 90,000 employees

00:17:51.334 --> 00:17:53.033
posting in this one system.

00:17:53.033 --> 00:17:57.000
And this activity stream is
just flooded with stuff.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.834
So there's a way
to scope that down.

00:17:58.834 --> 00:18:00.567
So we've introduced
a thing called Groups,

00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:04.934
which allows you to go in
and basically look at things

00:18:04.934 --> 00:18:07.200
in a much more focused--
And you can invite people.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.300
You can create public groups,
private groups.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:12.634
And you have, basically,
the same kind of feature set

00:18:12.634 --> 00:18:16.701
as the public piece of it,
but it's much more focused.

00:18:16.701 --> 00:18:20.467
And so we have lots of teams
in Groups within Oracle

00:18:20.467 --> 00:18:22.234
that are actually using
this tool

00:18:22.234 --> 00:18:24.434
as a communication
productivity tool

00:18:24.434 --> 00:18:25.767
within their teams.

00:18:25.767 --> 00:18:29.234
You can do feeds
and things like that too.

00:18:29.234 --> 00:18:32.267
In terms of OpenSocial and
the way we started interacting

00:18:32.267 --> 00:18:36.367
with OpenSocial, um,
when we created this--

00:18:36.367 --> 00:18:38.734
You know, our team consists
of four people,

00:18:38.734 --> 00:18:40.567
and there's two of us
that code this.

00:18:40.567 --> 00:18:44.100
And so, you know,
when we first launched this,

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.534
there was a lot of excitement
toward being able--

00:18:46.534 --> 00:18:48.367
people being able
to contribute to it.

00:18:48.367 --> 00:18:50.234
Everyone has an idea, right?

00:18:50.234 --> 00:18:52.434
And there's tons of developers
at Oracle

00:18:52.434 --> 00:18:56.100
who want to participate and
build something on top of it.

00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.300
So we were thinking of ways
to be able to scale the ability

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:01.901
to contribute to their project,

00:19:01.901 --> 00:19:04.868
and, you know, short of, like,
giving people commit rights

00:19:04.868 --> 00:19:07.267
to the code.

00:19:07.267 --> 00:19:09.767
So at the same time,
around 2007,

00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:11.400
that's when OpenSocial was
announced,

00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:14.200
and we were thinking
this is a great project

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.534
because then we can just,
you know--

00:19:15.534 --> 00:19:18.200
here's a framework
we can introduce

00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.767
that's got an API,
it's all fully documented.

00:19:22.767 --> 00:19:26.634
We can introduce this as a way
for people to build applications

00:19:26.634 --> 00:19:29.667
on top of the platform
that we've built,

00:19:29.667 --> 00:19:33.400
uh, without us having to
have to do that ourselves.

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.033
And so we got involved
and contacted Chris.

00:19:37.033 --> 00:19:39.067
Chris actually used to work
at Oracle as well.

00:19:39.067 --> 00:19:46.133
And, you know,
looked at the ability to--

00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:50.501
to use OpenSocial
within Connect.

00:19:50.501 --> 00:19:52.334
So what we've done is we've--

00:19:52.334 --> 00:19:57.434
Right now we have the ability
to say, like, add a gadget--

00:19:57.434 --> 00:19:59.868
an OpenSocial gadget
on people's profiles.

00:19:59.868 --> 00:20:02.968
So, like, on your profile
you can go in and, say--

00:20:02.968 --> 00:20:08.334
I have this one OpenSocial app
that I created called Tag Buzz.

00:20:08.334 --> 00:20:10.634
And I'll add that to my profile.

00:20:10.634 --> 00:20:12.267
I'm being told
I'm out of time here,

00:20:12.267 --> 00:20:15.000
so I'll show you this
real quick.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.968
So Tag Buzz is basically--

00:20:16.968 --> 00:20:19.567
It goes through and looks at
your user profile tags

00:20:19.567 --> 00:20:21.334
that you've tagged yourself
with.

00:20:21.334 --> 00:20:23.667
And within there it'll
basically go out

00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:25.234
and search Twitter for things.

00:20:25.234 --> 00:20:26.767
I used to work
on the PeopleSoft product,

00:20:26.767 --> 00:20:29.400
and one of the things
I used to work on

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:31.634
was PeopleTools.

00:20:31.634 --> 00:20:34.334
And I can say what people
are saying about PeopleTools,

00:20:34.334 --> 00:20:35.901
and I can reply directly.

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:41.400
So that's initially what we were
trying to do with OpenSocial.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.601
Schalk: Great. And I know
you have the Gadgets,

00:20:43.601 --> 00:20:45.634
but you also have Shindig
and stuff also running.

00:20:45.634 --> 00:20:46.801
Manalang:
Yeah, we're using Shindig.

00:20:46.801 --> 00:20:48.133
We've got an app directory.

00:20:48.133 --> 00:20:51.534
And the code is JRuby on Rails,

00:20:51.534 --> 00:20:55.367
but you know, Shindig is running
as a separate part of it,

00:20:55.367 --> 00:20:57.067
and acting as a container.

00:20:57.067 --> 00:20:58.801
Schalk: Okay, well,
thank you very much, Rich.

00:20:58.801 --> 00:21:00.200
All righty.
[applause]

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.868
Yeah, feel free to clap.
I mean--

00:21:01.868 --> 00:21:03.501
Unfortunately,
we don't have steps.

00:21:03.501 --> 00:21:06.100
Who do we have next?
Uh, yes. Go ahead.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:13.601
We have John Mayerhofer
of SAP.

00:21:13.601 --> 00:21:15.467
Mayerhofer:
Computer number three, please.

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:17.701
man: Yeah, and if you could
turn on the microphone.

00:21:17.701 --> 00:21:19.767
Mayerhofer: No,
I've got a mic.

00:21:19.767 --> 00:21:21.133
'Cause I noticed your arm
getting tired.

00:21:21.133 --> 00:21:22.133
Schalk: Okay.

00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:24.300
Mayerhofer: So...

00:21:42.067 --> 00:21:44.467
Okay, so again,
I'm John Mayerhofer,

00:21:44.467 --> 00:21:46.801
and I lead the business
standards team at SAP.

00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:49.267
And I want to say thank you
to all of you

00:21:49.267 --> 00:21:51.334
who must be highly interested
in this topic,

00:21:51.334 --> 00:21:52.834
as opposed to going to lunch.

00:21:52.834 --> 00:21:54.667
That's a true show
of interest.

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:56.701
And so I hope we can,
as a panel,

00:21:56.701 --> 00:21:58.701
not disappoint you here.

00:21:58.701 --> 00:22:02.434
I'm gonna just give you
a few words on who SAP is

00:22:02.434 --> 00:22:04.934
as context for why we care
about OpenSocial.

00:22:06.934 --> 00:22:09.434
So SAP is focused
on business applications.

00:22:09.434 --> 00:22:11.834
We are the number one
business applications provider

00:22:11.834 --> 00:22:13.200
in the world.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.267
Our customers represent
the output of about

00:22:15.267 --> 00:22:17.501
50% of the world's
gross domestic product.

00:22:17.501 --> 00:22:19.701
So we have a pretty big
footprint.

00:22:19.701 --> 00:22:21.934
I'd say, more importantly,
we touch the lives

00:22:21.934 --> 00:22:23.334
of everyone in this room.

00:22:23.334 --> 00:22:26.501
So we help power 75%
of the world's beer production.

00:22:26.501 --> 00:22:29.901
We help power 65% of the world's
chocolate production.

00:22:29.901 --> 00:22:32.934
If you guys have bought a song
on iTunes recently,

00:22:32.934 --> 00:22:35.734
you touch an SAP system.

00:22:35.734 --> 00:22:38.334
Because we sell things
that are from the core,

00:22:38.334 --> 00:22:42.601
like General Ledger,
Human Capital Management,

00:22:42.601 --> 00:22:48.000
Master Data Management, to
Business Intelligence Software,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.334
we touch everything.

00:22:49.334 --> 00:22:52.067
Because we do that,
we have a great opportunity

00:22:52.067 --> 00:22:55.267
to bake in processes,
and to enable processes

00:22:55.267 --> 00:23:00.033
that help our customers run
more sustainable businesses.

00:23:00.033 --> 00:23:02.601
And that's a great opportunity
and a responsibility

00:23:02.601 --> 00:23:04.434
that we take very seriously.

00:23:04.434 --> 00:23:07.200
So why do we care about
OpenSocial?

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.801
Well, we enable business
processes--

00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:11.868
software business applications,

00:23:11.868 --> 00:23:14.200
model and enable business
processes

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.901
which power business networks.

00:23:15.901 --> 00:23:19.133
Business networks consists
of people in other entities.

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:22.834
The relationship between people
has been important in business

00:23:22.834 --> 00:23:25.167
since the beginning of time.

00:23:25.167 --> 00:23:28.267
Many of the business processes
that we enable

00:23:28.267 --> 00:23:32.200
can benefit greatly
by providing the full benefit

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.467
of those relationships
between people.

00:23:34.467 --> 00:23:36.901
And the relationships between
people and other entities,

00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:41.501
like the processes themselves,
or companies or groups,

00:23:41.501 --> 00:23:42.634
for example.

00:23:42.634 --> 00:23:46.133
So this is why we care
about OpenSocial.

00:23:46.133 --> 00:23:50.801
I'm gonna show you, briefly,
one component--

00:23:50.801 --> 00:23:54.200
one tiny component of SAP
Social Composite.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.968
This is not actually
a product yet,

00:23:56.968 --> 00:23:58.501
although it's being used
internally

00:23:58.501 --> 00:24:00.267
by our employees at SAP.

00:24:00.267 --> 00:24:04.934
It's called the
Relationship Analysis Server.

00:24:04.934 --> 00:24:09.133
The Relationship Analysis Server
enables you to gather in data

00:24:09.133 --> 00:24:10.734
from multiple sources.

00:24:10.734 --> 00:24:12.968
It could be an exchange server,
for example.

00:24:12.968 --> 00:24:16.467
It could be an HR system
or a CRM system

00:24:16.467 --> 00:24:18.267
or many other sources.

00:24:18.267 --> 00:24:22.534
And it enables you to define
and divine the relationships

00:24:22.534 --> 00:24:24.033
between these entities.

00:24:24.033 --> 00:24:27.501
This thing is accessible
via a RESTful API.

00:24:27.501 --> 00:24:29.434
Any of you guys can
download this server

00:24:29.434 --> 00:24:30.934
and write apps against it,
by the way,

00:24:30.934 --> 00:24:32.467
and I'll show you where
to do that in just a moment.

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:35.234
And we've written an app
against it

00:24:35.234 --> 00:24:37.734
called the Social Network
Analyzer.

00:24:37.734 --> 00:24:44.200
And I'm gonna go and change
my identity for this demo.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.868
So I'm no longer
John Mayerhofer of SAP.

00:24:47.868 --> 00:24:53.501
I am now Nicholas Cox,
a collections manager

00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:55.868
in a mid-size software company.

00:24:55.868 --> 00:25:00.067
And what you see here is
how to access

00:25:00.067 --> 00:25:02.567
the Social Network Analyzer
if you want to download it

00:25:02.567 --> 00:25:04.534
or play with it online.

00:25:04.534 --> 00:25:07.000
This sample data
that I'm about to show you

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.300
is accessible on demand.

00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:12.334
So feel free to go here
afterwards.

00:25:12.334 --> 00:25:15.734
This site, by the way, is
our equivalent of Google Labs.

00:25:15.734 --> 00:25:18.534
So this is our kind of
labs area

00:25:18.534 --> 00:25:22.033
for business intelligence
software.

00:25:22.033 --> 00:25:24.501
So in the course
of my job--

00:25:24.501 --> 00:25:26.701
in the flow,
in the context of my job

00:25:26.701 --> 00:25:29.400
as a collections agent,
I get an invoice.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.200
I try to collect
on this invoice.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.868
For some reason,
it's overdue.

00:25:32.868 --> 00:25:35.567
In this case, Calex,
the customer--

00:25:35.567 --> 00:25:37.567
They're a big customer.
They're a good customer.

00:25:37.567 --> 00:25:39.701
They usually pay on time.
There's something wrong.

00:25:39.701 --> 00:25:41.534
But for the last three weeks,

00:25:41.534 --> 00:25:43.734
they haven't been returning
my phone calls.

00:25:43.734 --> 00:25:46.934
And so I want to use
the relationship--

00:25:46.934 --> 00:25:48.734
or the Social Network Analyzer
here,

00:25:48.734 --> 00:25:52.767
which can be in the flow
of my SAP system

00:25:52.767 --> 00:25:55.767
to do my job and collect
on this invoice.

00:25:55.767 --> 00:25:58.834
What you see here
on the right-- this view--

00:25:58.834 --> 00:26:01.367
is the profile panel.

00:26:01.367 --> 00:26:03.534
Nicholas Cox is the user.

00:26:03.534 --> 00:26:06.200
And Nicholas' profile
is aggregated

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.467
from multiple systems.

00:26:07.467 --> 00:26:09.801
In this case, an HR system
and a Project system.

00:26:09.801 --> 00:26:12.501
In the middle is
the entity pane.

00:26:12.501 --> 00:26:17.868
These are all the entities
that Nicholas has access to.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:20.367
And on the left you see
a search bar

00:26:20.367 --> 00:26:21.801
in faceted browsing,

00:26:21.801 --> 00:26:26.434
using the two in conjunction
to get to where you want to go.

00:26:26.434 --> 00:26:29.234
So if I click on one of
Nicholas' profile elements--

00:26:29.234 --> 00:26:30.467
Palo Alto--

00:26:30.467 --> 00:26:32.801
I will see all the people,
or all the entities,

00:26:32.801 --> 00:26:35.400
that are associated
with Palo Alto.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.367
33 out of 63.

00:26:37.367 --> 00:26:41.968
If I want to see all developers
in Palo Alto...I can do that.

00:26:41.968 --> 00:26:47.467
But back to my job--
collecting on this invoice.

00:26:47.467 --> 00:26:49.534
So I'm gonna search on Calex.

00:26:49.534 --> 00:26:52.467
Yep, Ursula Nobel is the contact
from Calex.

00:26:52.467 --> 00:26:55.167
A lot of her profile
comes from our CRM system.

00:26:55.167 --> 00:26:58.767
I'm going to explore
Ursula's connections

00:26:58.767 --> 00:27:00.434
to my company.

00:27:00.434 --> 00:27:02.567
So I see here there's multiple
different types

00:27:02.567 --> 00:27:04.100
of relationships.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.234
You can define "relationship"
such as "is a member of."

00:27:08.234 --> 00:27:11.067
In this case we're looking at
"is a member of" types

00:27:11.067 --> 00:27:12.868
of relationships.

00:27:12.868 --> 00:27:16.467
And Ursula is a member
of these groups.

00:27:16.467 --> 00:27:20.834
We could also have--instead of
the Ursula Nobel entity,

00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:23.367
we could also have
the entity Apple,

00:27:23.367 --> 00:27:25.734
and show the connections
to all the products

00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:28.968
that Apple has bought
from our company, for example.

00:27:28.968 --> 00:27:31.133
In this case, though,
this is good enough.

00:27:31.133 --> 00:27:34.033
Ursula Nobel is a member
of multiple groups.

00:27:34.033 --> 00:27:37.300
So likely, if I go
to the connect tab,

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:41.467
it's gonna be easy to calculate
the shortest path to Ursula.

00:27:41.467 --> 00:27:44.767
This is what it's all about is
the shortest path to Ursula,

00:27:44.767 --> 00:27:46.534
who is not paying
her invoice.

00:27:46.534 --> 00:27:53.100
So I, Nicholas Cox,
am related to Ursula

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.400
through three or four steps.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.834
The relationships are: I report
to Marge Collins, the CFO.

00:27:59.834 --> 00:28:04.400
Marge is a member of
the sales steering committee.

00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.467
And Ursula is also a member
of the sales steering committee.

00:28:08.467 --> 00:28:11.367
So Marge, and executive,
sits together with Ursula.

00:28:11.367 --> 00:28:15.367
The odds are if I throw both
Marge and Ursula on a clipboard,

00:28:15.367 --> 00:28:19.334
and initiate an action
to both of them--

00:28:19.334 --> 00:28:21.367
So here it says "send email."

00:28:21.367 --> 00:28:23.868
I could easily say
initiate conference call

00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:27.267
or initiate an Adobe Connect
session.

00:28:27.267 --> 00:28:31.234
It could be trigger an alert
to an ERP system.

00:28:31.234 --> 00:28:34.033
Anyway, I click on that,
I get an email triggered

00:28:34.033 --> 00:28:35.300
to both these people.

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:38.300
And now Ursula's bound
to get back to me

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.100
because she doesn't want
to embarrass herself

00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:43.133
in front of her executive friend
on the sales steering committee.

00:28:43.133 --> 00:28:46.200
This app also runs
on an iPhone.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:50.734
And I'm told by
our business innovation people

00:28:50.734 --> 00:28:52.734
that it will be running
on an Android system

00:28:52.734 --> 00:28:55.133
in the not-too-distant future.

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:58.434
So this is just on small aspect
of what we're doing

00:28:58.434 --> 00:29:03.200
to work in the social component
of business,

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:05.033
and enable the social component

00:29:05.033 --> 00:29:07.534
with the best available
technology.

00:29:07.534 --> 00:29:12.267
So SAP and OpenSocial...
SAP is a supporter.

00:29:12.267 --> 00:29:16.300
We believe that the concepts
behind OpenSocial

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:21.200
are going to make the lives
of our customers better.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.801
We believe that the standard
is viable--

00:29:24.801 --> 00:29:26.834
it's, you know,
out of the gate.

00:29:26.834 --> 00:29:28.367
And we would like
to work together

00:29:28.367 --> 00:29:31.000
the colleagues here
on this panel,

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.267
as well as other Enterprise
companies

00:29:33.267 --> 00:29:35.234
and the broader
OpenSocial community

00:29:35.234 --> 00:29:39.267
to help modify and evolve
the standard

00:29:39.267 --> 00:29:41.734
so that it actually meets
the needs

00:29:41.734 --> 00:29:43.200
of Enterprise customers.

00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.400
And it's a pretty big
population

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.300
with a pretty big impact.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:51.334
So, if you have any questions,
I think I'm done for now.

00:29:51.334 --> 00:29:52.334
Schalk: We can hear
the questions at the end.

00:29:52.334 --> 00:29:53.601
But anyway,
thank you very much.

00:29:53.601 --> 00:29:54.801
Mayerhofer: Thank you.

00:29:54.801 --> 00:29:56.200
Schalk: Who do we have next?
[applause]

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.701
We have Dave.

00:29:59.701 --> 00:30:01.334
So hopefully we'll have
enough time

00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:03.467
for the panel discussion
as well.

00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:05.534
Do you want me to hold the mic,
or do you want to do it--

00:30:05.534 --> 00:30:07.467
Carroll: Yeah, you can hold
the mic for me.

00:30:07.467 --> 00:30:09.701
Schalk: Okay.

00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:11.000
Do you still have to plug in?

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.634
Carroll: No, no, I just have
to cheat and get a URL.

00:30:13.634 --> 00:30:16.734
Schalk: Okay, okay.

00:30:16.734 --> 00:30:18.167
Carroll: I need my glasses.

00:30:18.167 --> 00:30:20.267
I didn't need my glasses
when I first started

00:30:20.267 --> 00:30:23.667
in this industry.

00:30:23.667 --> 00:30:26.767
So salesforce.com...

00:30:26.767 --> 00:30:32.300
we have historically looked
to the consumer web--sorry--

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:36.200
the consumer web...
to give us direction

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.100
for the business web.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:41.901
And like we've seen,
internet applications,

00:30:41.901 --> 00:30:43.968
business applications,
Enterprise applications

00:30:43.968 --> 00:30:48.968
go onto the web
in terms of sass and on-demand.

00:30:48.968 --> 00:30:52.567
Rich UIs, some of the
UI paradigms

00:30:52.567 --> 00:30:54.234
that you're used to seeing.

00:30:54.234 --> 00:30:57.934
We're also seeing, now, Social
as another thing

00:30:57.934 --> 00:31:00.801
that we need to make sure
that the people

00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:02.801
who are using the internet

00:31:02.801 --> 00:31:04.767
can use it in the business
scenario.

00:31:04.767 --> 00:31:06.267
And Social's a big part
of that.

00:31:06.267 --> 00:31:11.033
To start,
what I'd like to do--

00:31:11.033 --> 00:31:13.400
I'll hold it for now--

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:15.901
--not that I don't
appreciate that--

00:31:15.901 --> 00:31:21.701
is start off with a couple
of customers of ours

00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:23.934
who are currently
taking advantage of

00:31:23.934 --> 00:31:28.267
the social web today
on our platform.

00:31:28.267 --> 00:31:32.167
So what you see here is a site--
a live site at a Starbucks

00:31:32.167 --> 00:31:34.000
called "My Ideas."

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.200
And this is a site that
they built

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:39.067
on the first dot com platform

00:31:39.067 --> 00:31:41.634
that is used to reach out
to their customer base

00:31:41.634 --> 00:31:44.601
to enable Starbucks
to better listen

00:31:44.601 --> 00:31:49.234
to what their customers want,
and react with that.

00:31:49.234 --> 00:31:51.100
But there's more to it
than that.

00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:53.734
So this application
is not only available

00:31:53.734 --> 00:31:57.667
right here on their web site,
but is available on Facebook

00:31:57.667 --> 00:31:59.300
as an application.

00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:03.067
And so people that come
to this site from Facebook,

00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:06.868
when they vote for an idea,
when they suggest an idea,

00:32:06.868 --> 00:32:09.767
of course, that's updated
on their activity stream

00:32:09.767 --> 00:32:11.400
so other people can see it.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.701
That way Facebook--
sorry, Starbucks has

00:32:15.701 --> 00:32:19.667
this viral exposure
to a lot more people

00:32:19.667 --> 00:32:22.434
than those who might wander by
and see their site.

00:32:22.434 --> 00:32:27.033
Which I think is a big part
of Social on the Enterprise.

00:32:27.033 --> 00:32:31.734
Dell, another large company--
Enterprise-class company--

00:32:31.734 --> 00:32:36.334
building a social application
on the force.com platform.

00:32:36.334 --> 00:32:41.133
This one is aimed towards
innovation, as you can see.

00:32:41.133 --> 00:32:42.934
And I know we're
running low on time,

00:32:42.934 --> 00:32:47.367
so I'll go to one more site,

00:32:47.367 --> 00:32:50.767
which really has a kind
of two-edged social--

00:32:50.767 --> 00:32:53.501
social networking as well as
social awareness.

00:32:53.501 --> 00:32:56.567
This is a site
by Starbucks again,

00:32:56.567 --> 00:32:58.934
built on the force.com
platform

00:32:58.934 --> 00:33:05.467
to get people to volunteer
for charity events.

00:33:05.467 --> 00:33:11.834
And so salesforce.com's approach
to OpenSocial, in particular,

00:33:11.834 --> 00:33:13.734
is to create a platform

00:33:13.734 --> 00:33:16.000
on which you can build
these applications,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.133
connect to various
social sites.

00:33:19.133 --> 00:33:23.667
And in that way bring
the social aspect--

00:33:23.667 --> 00:33:26.601
the professional networking
and social networking--

00:33:26.601 --> 00:33:28.234
to the Enterprise.

00:33:28.234 --> 00:33:32.334
Now, I have a demo,
and Lord willing, it'll work.

00:33:32.334 --> 00:33:35.968
So if you'll hold the microphone
for me...

00:33:35.968 --> 00:33:41.300
I just have to type in
a correct URL.

00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:43.067
Okay, so it's gonna be:

00:33:43.067 --> 00:33:51.200
61demo-developeraddition.

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:56.601
na6.force.com

00:33:56.601 --> 00:33:58.400
[laughter]

00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:01.901
Now you know why I had to look
at my cheat sheet.

00:34:01.901 --> 00:34:06.000
So you know, the force.com
platform allows you

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.667
to exercise various kinds
of APIs.

00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:13.667
In particular, REST APIs are
very easy on the platform.

00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:15.801
And what I've done here
is built a site

00:34:15.801 --> 00:34:17.667
using a developer edition,

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.067
which anybody can use today.

00:34:20.067 --> 00:34:24.601
Oh, by the way, security is
a very big, important thing

00:34:24.601 --> 00:34:27.100
for Enterprise customers.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:29.133
And that's why I'm willing
to put up with

00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:32.067
the mixed security message
there.

00:34:32.067 --> 00:34:35.033
And what I've got is
kind of a customer portal site

00:34:35.033 --> 00:34:38.200
where my customers who--

00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.467
they may be at arms' reach
from me,

00:34:41.467 --> 00:34:43.534
but they still want
to let me know about

00:34:43.534 --> 00:34:47.367
maybe some support issues
that they have--

00:34:47.367 --> 00:34:51.267
can come here and,
rather than create

00:34:51.267 --> 00:34:53.901
yet another set
of password credentials,

00:34:53.901 --> 00:34:56.434
they can just sign on
with Google Connect.

00:34:56.434 --> 00:34:59.400
Of course, Google Connect
leverages the OpenSocial APIs

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.000
and specifications,
so I can go ahead and select

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.234
maybe my Google account.

00:35:08.234 --> 00:35:13.000
Sign in as a different user
here...'cause that wasn't me.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:14.234
Schalk: Oh, right.
[laughter]

00:35:14.234 --> 00:35:18.200
Carroll: And see, this is coming
from Google,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:22.601
so it's not just my site.

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:31.934
Okay, so once I sign in there...

00:35:31.934 --> 00:35:37.234
then I can automatically
be signed in as a user

00:35:37.234 --> 00:35:42.567
inside of this new portal
that I've created for my site.

00:35:42.567 --> 00:35:44.801
And this is something
that our customers can do.

00:35:44.801 --> 00:35:47.267
And so once I'm signed in,
of course,

00:35:47.267 --> 00:35:50.033
I have access now
to a "cases" tab,

00:35:50.033 --> 00:35:52.534
where I can see various cases

00:35:52.534 --> 00:35:54.501
that other people
have published.

00:35:54.501 --> 00:35:57.901
I can submit my own
support case.

00:35:57.901 --> 00:36:00.567
I get things like--
interesting information,

00:36:00.567 --> 00:36:03.167
such as profile pictures.

00:36:03.167 --> 00:36:06.467
But more than that,
I also magically get

00:36:06.467 --> 00:36:09.501
some social networking
capabilities

00:36:09.501 --> 00:36:12.801
without actually having to
implement them on my platform.

00:36:12.801 --> 00:36:16.367
Because I'm allowing Friend
Connect now to keep track of

00:36:16.367 --> 00:36:19.200
a lot of the activity
that's happening on this site.

00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.267
For instance, we have
an activity stream.

00:36:21.267 --> 00:36:24.534
This can be on a per-page basis,
or you can submit an ID,

00:36:24.534 --> 00:36:27.267
so maybe the activity's related
to a specific case.

00:36:27.267 --> 00:36:30.467
I can also see--whoops.

00:36:30.467 --> 00:36:35.601
I can also jump into comments
about a particular use--

00:36:35.601 --> 00:36:41.734
er, uh...support case that
somebody might have filed.

00:36:41.734 --> 00:36:44.534
They can give us answers
and so on.

00:36:44.534 --> 00:36:48.167
And so in this way
we allow our customers

00:36:48.167 --> 00:36:51.367
and our developers who are
building applications

00:36:51.367 --> 00:36:53.968
to connect to the various
social networks.

00:36:53.968 --> 00:36:57.067
And so I'm a little under time,
and I'm gonna leave it at that

00:36:57.067 --> 00:36:59.067
and turn it over
to the next person.

00:36:59.067 --> 00:37:01.901
Schalk: Okay, thank you
very much, Rich--uh...Dave!

00:37:01.901 --> 00:37:04.000
I was looking at Rich
when I said that.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.667
Anyway, so next up we have Tug,
from eXo Platform.

00:37:08.667 --> 00:37:12.434
And thank you very much
for coming.

00:37:12.434 --> 00:37:14.400
Are you all set?

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:18.567
Or good afternoon,
actually.

00:37:18.567 --> 00:37:23.400
Grall: I want to start
with a very short one slide

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.501
to show you at least--

00:37:26.501 --> 00:37:29.534
If you don't know
what eXo Platform is...

00:37:29.534 --> 00:37:32.133
Schalk: Is that microphone on?
Okay, okay.

00:37:32.133 --> 00:37:34.601
Grall: We are an integrated
portal.

00:37:34.601 --> 00:37:39.934
We develop data for contact
management, collaboration,

00:37:39.934 --> 00:37:42.834
knowledge management,
discussion forums, calendars,

00:37:42.834 --> 00:37:45.434
this kind of stuff that use
and are based

00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:53.000
on a standard-based portal
on all the sub-layer standards

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.467
in the Java world.

00:37:54.467 --> 00:37:58.467
So portlets, Java Content
Repository to manage content,

00:37:58.467 --> 00:38:02.400
but also for RESTful,
based on AJAX--

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:05.300
or REST--REST services.

00:38:05.300 --> 00:38:10.267
And we have added OpenSocial
to be able to communicate

00:38:10.267 --> 00:38:13.667
and create social applications
between all these components.

00:38:13.667 --> 00:38:16.634
And we [indistinct]

00:38:16.634 --> 00:38:18.767
and we leveraged
the security model

00:38:18.767 --> 00:38:25.133
and the storage that is already
in eXo Platform.

00:38:25.133 --> 00:38:27.501
So when you arrive
in your portal--

00:38:27.501 --> 00:38:30.033
I will authenticate...

00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:41.000
And depending of my profile,
I will see, more or less,

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.234
more information.

00:38:43.234 --> 00:38:49.067
And using OpenSocial,
you can create your friend

00:38:49.067 --> 00:38:50.734
contact clusters.

00:38:50.734 --> 00:38:52.100
You can remove or add.

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:57.267
But also we do mashups
of two portlets.

00:38:57.267 --> 00:39:00.100
So it's not kept yet
in this specific page.

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:04.534
It's two standard-based portlets
that use OpenSocial as a beacon

00:39:04.534 --> 00:39:09.634
to aggregate the list
of my profile of my friends,

00:39:09.634 --> 00:39:14.167
but also some Google Maps
information.

00:39:14.167 --> 00:39:18.234
So it's not only able
to share information

00:39:18.234 --> 00:39:21.167
between multiple consumer
services,

00:39:21.167 --> 00:39:23.434
but also internal applications,

00:39:23.434 --> 00:39:25.467
such as the Content Management
System,

00:39:25.467 --> 00:39:31.834
will be able to provide
information on the platform

00:39:31.834 --> 00:39:35.100
using Activity Stream
to the different contacts.

00:39:35.100 --> 00:39:37.067
So what I will do--

00:39:37.067 --> 00:39:42.367
I am connecting
my operating system

00:39:42.367 --> 00:39:45.167
to the Content Management
System.

00:39:51.667 --> 00:39:54.801
[indistinct]

00:39:54.801 --> 00:39:57.667
So now I can surf
my Content Management space

00:39:57.667 --> 00:39:59.167
on Java Content Repository.

00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:02.167
So it's based on the pure
Java-based standards.

00:40:02.167 --> 00:40:09.367
I'm taking one content
from my local drive

00:40:09.367 --> 00:40:12.667
and push it on the server.

00:40:12.667 --> 00:40:14.834
So now it's stored,
it's secure,

00:40:14.834 --> 00:40:18.367
and it could be shared
between different users.

00:40:18.367 --> 00:40:22.501
And if I go on "Chris...
activities..."

00:40:22.501 --> 00:40:25.567
I can see now that
one new activity

00:40:25.567 --> 00:40:27.934
has been added
to the stream.

00:40:27.934 --> 00:40:32.601
And I can also see that,
on my dashboard.

00:40:32.601 --> 00:40:34.767
And here we are moving
to the gadgets.

00:40:34.767 --> 00:40:38.601
So I show you more of
the server side of OpenSocial,

00:40:38.601 --> 00:40:42.501
where now I can see
the client side using gadgets.

00:40:42.501 --> 00:40:45.033
So we see this new activity
streaming.

00:40:45.033 --> 00:40:47.434
And they are purely
OpenSocial gadgets running,

00:40:47.434 --> 00:40:50.934
for most of them,
inside eXo Container.

00:40:50.934 --> 00:40:53.133
But this one is coming,
for example,

00:40:53.133 --> 00:40:55.267
from [indistinct].

00:40:55.267 --> 00:41:02.067
And what we have here is
we have multiple gadgets.

00:41:02.067 --> 00:41:05.200
One, the list of my documents.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:09.434
And I will show you how we built
this specific gadget,

00:41:09.434 --> 00:41:11.634
and how you can
administrate that.

00:41:11.634 --> 00:41:18.133
So I will go to my, let's say,
back office.

00:41:18.133 --> 00:41:21.467
But, in fact,
it's the web OS.

00:41:21.467 --> 00:41:25.400
So the web overriding system.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:29.767
It's a new way of using
the application

00:41:29.767 --> 00:41:31.200
directly from your browser.

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.300
So what I have here is
I have a portlet.

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.100
But this portlet,
instead of being

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.868
on the standard portal page,

00:41:37.868 --> 00:41:40.334
it's directly in
my multi-window system

00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:43.167
inside my browser.

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:47.033
And what we see is it's
a total base portlet.

00:41:47.033 --> 00:41:52.901
Another way of using the gadget
on top of desk port desk.

00:41:52.901 --> 00:41:57.300
And this specific portlet is
where I administrate and create

00:41:57.300 --> 00:42:00.634
and deploy portlets and gadgets.

00:42:00.634 --> 00:42:04.901
So for portlets,
you deploy your [indistinct].

00:42:04.901 --> 00:42:06.634
You deploy your
standard applications.

00:42:06.634 --> 00:42:09.534
You can do the same
with Gadget.

00:42:09.534 --> 00:42:11.701
But we have, also, something
that is quite interesting,

00:42:11.701 --> 00:42:14.367
if you want to be able
to make your platform

00:42:14.367 --> 00:42:15.901
richer and richer,

00:42:15.901 --> 00:42:20.701
is we can directly edit
new gadget

00:42:20.701 --> 00:42:23.834
directly from the browser.

00:42:23.834 --> 00:42:26.834
Or use WebDash to push
the XML file.

00:42:26.834 --> 00:42:31.934
So here is an OpenSocial gadget
that is stored inside eXo.

00:42:31.934 --> 00:42:33.534
And one important part

00:42:33.534 --> 00:42:35.234
when you deploy
for the Enterprise,

00:42:35.234 --> 00:42:38.234
it's about how you expose
these gadgets or portlets

00:42:38.234 --> 00:42:41.100
to the user
based on their profile.

00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:43.968
So when I choose to expose
a specific gadget,

00:42:43.968 --> 00:42:46.734
for example this one,

00:42:46.734 --> 00:42:49.334
I can choose who will
be able to use it,

00:42:49.334 --> 00:42:51.934
who will be able to put that
on his dashboard.

00:42:51.934 --> 00:42:56.400
So I show you, like,
how I can create the gadget.

00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:00.167
But how I created the backend--
the REST services--

00:43:00.167 --> 00:43:03.701
so you can use any REST API
of Java API.

00:43:03.701 --> 00:43:06.133
But what we also have
extended is--

00:43:06.133 --> 00:43:11.400
We create, using Groovy
as our scripting language--

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.834
an editor that you can
directly use from your browser.

00:43:15.834 --> 00:43:19.100
So I am using, again,
the Java Content Repository

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.868
because, you see that here,
I have the content

00:43:20.868 --> 00:43:22.167
with the newer command.

00:43:22.167 --> 00:43:28.667
But I can also directly edit
my Groovy card

00:43:28.667 --> 00:43:30.767
inside the browser.

00:43:30.767 --> 00:43:36.868
And for people that are familiar
with REST services--

00:43:36.868 --> 00:43:42.367
REST uses, Java based--
we use a connection to GSR,

00:43:42.367 --> 00:43:45.534
and I can deploy and update
the service as I need

00:43:45.534 --> 00:43:48.567
when I am running
in production also.

00:43:48.567 --> 00:43:51.334
And since we can access Gadgets
using WebDash,

00:43:51.334 --> 00:43:53.467
you can also plug that
to your IED

00:43:53.467 --> 00:43:56.501
to be able to put that
in the most standard life cycle

00:43:56.501 --> 00:43:58.868
of that kind of the allotment.

00:43:58.868 --> 00:44:01.200
Schalk: Okay, well,
thank you very much.

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.367
We're gonna go ahead
and switch over now to Mike.

00:44:04.367 --> 00:44:06.267
I can hold the mic.
Thank you.

00:44:06.267 --> 00:44:09.767
And again, feel free
to submit your questions

00:44:09.767 --> 00:44:12.133
to the moderator page
that we have.

00:44:12.133 --> 00:44:13.467
And hopefully we'll have
some time

00:44:13.467 --> 00:44:17.434
to have a good discussion
afterwards.

00:44:17.434 --> 00:44:20.400
So I'll go ahead and
hold the mic for you as well.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.934
Feel free to introduce yourself
again as well.

00:44:22.934 --> 00:44:26.634
Brookes: Uh...

00:44:26.634 --> 00:44:33.133
Schalk: Oh, you zoomed in.
Yeah, there you go.

00:44:33.133 --> 00:44:35.100
Brookes: All right, I'll try
and do it briefly,

00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:38.300
and I'll try and use some--
oh, jeez.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:42.767
That's gonna make life
interesting, isn't it?

00:44:42.767 --> 00:44:45.868
All right, well, sorry.

00:44:45.868 --> 00:44:48.667
I'm using someone else's machine
with a PDF

00:44:48.667 --> 00:44:50.467
that didn't come across
properly.

00:44:50.467 --> 00:44:52.100
Um...

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:54.434
Schalk: Do you want to switch
to one of the other machines?

00:44:54.434 --> 00:45:00.133
Brookes: No, that's all right.
Schalk: Okay.

00:45:00.133 --> 00:45:03.667
I can hold the mic.

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:07.100
Brookes: [muttering]

00:45:13.434 --> 00:45:17.467
All right, so how many people
know who Atlassian is, or...

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:19.334
Excellent. More people
than OpenSocial.

00:45:19.334 --> 00:45:21.400
I love that.
Thank you.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:23.667
So we make collaboration tools
and development tools.

00:45:23.667 --> 00:45:25.400
Our collaboration tools,
obviously,

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:27.534
large enterprise wikis,
et cetera.

00:45:27.534 --> 00:45:32.567
Um, the, uh--
There we go.

00:45:32.567 --> 00:45:34.968
Well, you'll just have
to scan through this.

00:45:34.968 --> 00:45:36.634
I apologize.
Schalk: I'll pull it down.

00:45:36.634 --> 00:45:39.400
Brookes: So one of the things
I wanted to talk today about

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.467
was the development tools--

00:45:40.467 --> 00:45:41.634
so something a little bit
different.

00:45:41.634 --> 00:45:43.167
Collaboration tools, obviously,
are wiki.

00:45:43.167 --> 00:45:44.467
You have friends and other
people,

00:45:44.467 --> 00:45:46.534
so it can be implemented
as a social network

00:45:46.534 --> 00:45:47.734
relatively easily.

00:45:47.734 --> 00:45:49.234
But I wanted to talk about
development tools

00:45:49.234 --> 00:45:52.200
and how we're trying to make
them also into a social network.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.267
So if you think about developers
very quickly,

00:45:54.267 --> 00:45:56.567
they're people who work
in teams,

00:45:56.567 --> 00:45:58.067
collaborate on some sort
of shared objects,

00:45:58.067 --> 00:46:00.534
and they generate
a whole lot of activity, right?

00:46:00.534 --> 00:46:03.934
So if we have a look
at who they are, briefly...

00:46:03.934 --> 00:46:06.534
Down here you can see
the shared objects they work on:

00:46:06.534 --> 00:46:09.434
obviously source code,
issues, builds, projects.

00:46:09.434 --> 00:46:11.434
Some sort of documentation,
specs.

00:46:11.434 --> 00:46:13.534
These things, as developers,
we're all used to.

00:46:13.534 --> 00:46:15.868
And the activity they generate,

00:46:15.868 --> 00:46:18.100
obviously things like Commits,
build values,

00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.868
comments, new tasks, new issues,
that sort of thing.

00:46:20.868 --> 00:46:22.300
So we thought it'd be
really interesting

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:24.868
if we take all of this activity
in these shared objects

00:46:24.868 --> 00:46:27.567
and try to put them into
some sort of a social context

00:46:27.567 --> 00:46:29.868
using OpenSocial.

00:46:29.868 --> 00:46:33.033
So the other part for us
that's important is--

00:46:33.033 --> 00:46:35.367
this slide
in the bottom left-hand corner--

00:46:35.367 --> 00:46:37.300
is today, pretty much
all your Enterprise apps

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:38.601
are basically silos.

00:46:38.601 --> 00:46:40.734
So we also look at OpenSocial,

00:46:40.734 --> 00:46:42.100
besides being a social
technology ,

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:43.701
as a very interesting
technology stack

00:46:43.701 --> 00:46:45.968
for connecting a lot
of Enterprise applications

00:46:45.968 --> 00:46:50.367
in a very, very simple,
standard way.

00:46:50.367 --> 00:46:52.167
So in this case,
your applications--

00:46:52.167 --> 00:46:55.133
In this case, one application
might be your source code for,

00:46:55.133 --> 00:46:56.734
looking again
at the developer network--

00:46:56.734 --> 00:46:58.968
your issues, tasks, projects.

00:46:58.968 --> 00:47:01.100
And let's assume you store
your documentation

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:02.601
in some sort of wiki.

00:47:02.601 --> 00:47:05.667
These are all, at the moment,
relatively disconnected.

00:47:05.667 --> 00:47:08.000
So what we can see is
with OpenSocial,

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.601
we can do some things where
we can actually connect

00:47:09.601 --> 00:47:11.234
all of the applications
together,

00:47:11.234 --> 00:47:14.167
so we can put pieces of the wiki
into the issue tracker.

00:47:14.167 --> 00:47:16.033
Or pieces of source code,
for example,

00:47:16.033 --> 00:47:18.200
into the issue tracker.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.300
And then we can do things like

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:21.667
get a complete view
of your project.

00:47:21.667 --> 00:47:23.400
So instead of just seeing
the tasks,

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.434
and then moving to another
server to see the source code,

00:47:25.434 --> 00:47:27.667
we can start integrating all of
these different things together

00:47:27.667 --> 00:47:29.868
so you get a single activity
stream across everything.

00:47:29.868 --> 00:47:32.367
No matter which set of tools
you're using,

00:47:32.367 --> 00:47:36.300
you can comment, interact,
and things like that.

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.934
And another scenario I'm going
to show you very briefly

00:47:38.934 --> 00:47:40.367
is "managers."

00:47:40.367 --> 00:47:42.334
So let's assume the developer
on your development team

00:47:42.334 --> 00:47:44.868
works inside JIRA,
or some other issue tracker

00:47:44.868 --> 00:47:46.234
as their center point.

00:47:46.234 --> 00:47:49.467
Most managers spend
a lot of time doing email.

00:47:49.467 --> 00:47:52.100
Most of their time, all their
time doing their work email.

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.934
So Gmail actually gives us

00:47:53.934 --> 00:47:55.367
a really nice,
open social container

00:47:55.367 --> 00:47:57.634
to start pulling
various development tools into

00:47:57.634 --> 00:47:58.801
that the manager might want
to look at

00:47:58.801 --> 00:48:01.234
in order to see
what's going on--

00:48:01.234 --> 00:48:03.968
viewing activity status
and creating issues

00:48:03.968 --> 00:48:04.968
and that sort of thing--

00:48:04.968 --> 00:48:06.467
during their development
management.

00:48:06.467 --> 00:48:08.501
So we've launched this site.

00:48:08.501 --> 00:48:10.467
If you want to get more detail,
there's a whole bunch of movies,

00:48:10.467 --> 00:48:13.300
screen shots, and other stuff
at atlassian.com/opensocial.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.300
If you want to find out about
OpenSocial in the Enterprise,

00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:17.234
it's a good place
to have a look.

00:48:17.234 --> 00:48:20.601
So let me give you the briefest
of brief demos.

00:48:20.601 --> 00:48:26.734
So this is JIRA 4,
which is in beta, as of Monday,

00:48:26.734 --> 00:48:29.968
running with a whole bunch
of different things inside it.

00:48:29.968 --> 00:48:32.234
So for those familiar
with JIRA,

00:48:32.234 --> 00:48:34.834
you'll be relatively familiar
with things like these charts.

00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:36.601
What you want to be
familiar with is that

00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:38.467
you can now, obviously,
move them around

00:48:38.467 --> 00:48:39.968
into a whole bunch of things.

00:48:39.968 --> 00:48:42.234
Everything you see on this page
is an OpenSocial application

00:48:42.234 --> 00:48:43.801
or a gadget.

00:48:43.801 --> 00:48:45.834
So they're all running here.

00:48:45.834 --> 00:48:48.000
The different colors I've used
in this case to connote

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.167
that these things come from
Confluence.

00:48:50.167 --> 00:48:53.167
So I can do nav against
Confluence,

00:48:53.167 --> 00:48:55.000
and go and navigate
to my wiki pages.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.033
Similarly, I can see
my code reviews.

00:48:57.033 --> 00:48:59.501
And these gadgets themselves
are, obviously,

00:48:59.501 --> 00:49:01.934
just standard OpenSocial clocks
and weather widgets

00:49:01.934 --> 00:49:03.434
and that sort of thing.

00:49:03.434 --> 00:49:06.067
And things like the build data
I can get here,

00:49:06.067 --> 00:49:07.601
so I can see when
the build is failing.

00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:09.200
It'll refresh itself.

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:11.267
So one's failing,
one's passing.

00:49:11.267 --> 00:49:13.167
So this is the sort of thing
you can get.

00:49:13.167 --> 00:49:14.467
And similarly,
like everyone else,

00:49:14.467 --> 00:49:15.868
we have a directory.

00:49:15.868 --> 00:49:17.367
But remember, these are all
development tools,

00:49:17.367 --> 00:49:18.767
and all the tools
I'm interacting with here

00:49:18.767 --> 00:49:21.634
are for developers.

00:49:21.634 --> 00:49:23.033
So if you want to get charts,
you can here.

00:49:23.033 --> 00:49:24.567
See, I can get charts
for my build system,

00:49:24.567 --> 00:49:25.968
charts for my issues--

00:49:25.968 --> 00:49:27.801
go and get them from Source
Control, that sort of thing.

00:49:27.801 --> 00:49:30.200
So, trying to bring all your
development tools together.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.601
And obviously, because
it's an open standard,

00:49:31.601 --> 00:49:34.000
XML based, other development
tools can implement gadgets,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.467
and we can pull them in as well.

00:49:35.467 --> 00:49:37.100
And all of this, uh--

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:39.133
If I had more time I could show
you this entire dashboard

00:49:39.133 --> 00:49:40.234
running in iGoogle.

00:49:40.234 --> 00:49:41.667
So if you have JIRA running
publicly,

00:49:41.667 --> 00:49:43.267
we support OAUTH
and everything else.

00:49:43.267 --> 00:49:44.300
And because these are
all gadgets,

00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.767
you can them pull them out,

00:49:45.767 --> 00:49:47.968
and put them into a different
portal container the same way.

00:49:47.968 --> 00:49:50.100
So more interesting here--
ooh.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.334
Let me sign out of Dave's email.
Sorry.

00:49:53.334 --> 00:49:56.367
If we think about the job
of a manager--

00:49:56.367 --> 00:50:00.267
So in this case we've created
a fake Google mail account.

00:50:00.267 --> 00:50:02.834
I apologize to Google for using
some of your resources--

00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:07.901
of pseudo-development manager.

00:50:07.901 --> 00:50:10.434
Schalk: We do the same thing.

00:50:10.434 --> 00:50:12.234
Brookes: Everyone has multiple
Gmail accounts.

00:50:12.234 --> 00:50:14.267
It's allowed, right?

00:50:14.267 --> 00:50:16.467
So this pseudo-development
manager has

00:50:16.467 --> 00:50:20.968
a development environment--
sorry, an email environment

00:50:20.968 --> 00:50:23.067
that actually involves a whole
bunch of different gadgets.

00:50:23.067 --> 00:50:25.300
So for those that don't know,
Gmail is actually

00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.734
an entire sort of
social container.

00:50:26.734 --> 00:50:29.200
You can put gadgets into it,
you have lists of friends,

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:30.634
you can make a network.

00:50:30.634 --> 00:50:32.667
So if you're using, for example,
Google Enterprise apps,

00:50:32.667 --> 00:50:35.601
you can have all
of your colleagues in there,

00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:37.033
and then you can create
social groups

00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:40.067
in apps for the Enterprise,
or whatever the code name is.

00:50:40.067 --> 00:50:42.968
But what you'll start to see
is things like--

00:50:42.968 --> 00:50:44.667
You know, for example,
this is a developer.

00:50:44.667 --> 00:50:47.667
Obviously Mark's a little lazy
'cause he's just emailed me

00:50:47.667 --> 00:50:50.067
and said, you know,
here's a bug.

00:50:50.067 --> 00:50:51.534
Which doesn't really help me.

00:50:51.534 --> 00:50:53.133
But what I can now do is,
inside Gmail,

00:50:53.133 --> 00:51:00.067
I can actually create the issue
from inside here.

00:51:00.067 --> 00:51:02.334
And I can obviously go
and create it.

00:51:02.334 --> 00:51:04.367
It's gonna create it in JIRA
in here.

00:51:04.367 --> 00:51:05.868
I have the issue--
I can go and look at it,

00:51:05.868 --> 00:51:08.567
or I can just email him back
and say, "Here's the issue."

00:51:08.567 --> 00:51:11.467
We can pull in
all sorts of gadgets.

00:51:11.467 --> 00:51:14.200
So we have your social network
from Confluence coming in.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.734
That's the sort of standard
Facebook-like

00:51:15.734 --> 00:51:17.167
social network, if you like.

00:51:17.167 --> 00:51:19.300
You can see, you can mash it up
with Twitter and other things.

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.534
And then this is
a particular gadget here

00:51:21.534 --> 00:51:23.234
that shows you--

00:51:23.234 --> 00:51:24.701
This gadget here is
actually running

00:51:24.701 --> 00:51:26.367
with the social data
from Gmail.

00:51:26.367 --> 00:51:28.968
So I have Jonathan and Tim
actually added as friends.

00:51:28.968 --> 00:51:30.834
So I will only see
their activity

00:51:30.834 --> 00:51:32.667
in this particular gadget
in Gmail.

00:51:32.667 --> 00:51:35.400
It uses a Canvas View,
so it'll open up...

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.734
It would show me Jonathan's
activity if I logged in there.

00:51:37.734 --> 00:51:39.100
But the interesting thing,
I always think,

00:51:39.100 --> 00:51:40.767
is you can sort of chat
over the top.

00:51:40.767 --> 00:51:42.167
So I can have all these
different services

00:51:42.167 --> 00:51:43.801
running in Gmail.

00:51:43.801 --> 00:51:45.901
And if I had more time,
and Wave was public,

00:51:45.901 --> 00:51:48.167
I would give you a demo of
the same thing running in Wave.

00:51:48.167 --> 00:51:50.667
Schalk: The paper that you
just des--or the URL.

00:51:50.667 --> 00:51:52.033
The new web site
that you launched,

00:51:52.033 --> 00:51:53.534
it gives details
on this thing--

00:51:53.534 --> 00:51:55.200
Brookes: Yes, there's movies
of this in much more detail--

00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:57.434
atlassian.com/opensocial.

00:51:57.434 --> 00:52:00.400
And you'll be able to download
the JIRA container for Monday.

00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:01.868
Thank you.

00:52:01.868 --> 00:52:03.667
Schalk: Well, anyway,
we're getting towards the end.

00:52:03.667 --> 00:52:05.267
Thank you very much.
Awesome demos.

00:52:05.267 --> 00:52:08.634
[applause]

00:52:08.634 --> 00:52:12.133
I am going to shift us over
into Q&amp;A.

00:52:12.133 --> 00:52:15.334
And we have moderator questions,
but feel free to come up

00:52:15.334 --> 00:52:16.567
to the front here.

00:52:16.567 --> 00:52:18.234
We're obviously running out
of time.

00:52:18.234 --> 00:52:20.968
Our timer says that we have
seven and a half minutes,
