00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.330
According to the World Health Organization,
cancer cases are expected to rise a whopping

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.770
57% worldwide in the next 20 years.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.540
You probably know or are related to someone
who has fought cancer and you may have seen

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.129
them go through chemotherapy.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.650
But...what is it?

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.390
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.840
Currently a diagnosis of cancer leaves patients
with three main options for treatment: surgery,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
radiation, or chemotherapy.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.939
Of the three, chemotherapy can be the most
debilitating.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.470
It’s a pretty barbaric treatment.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.910
Technically, chemotherapy is poison, but it's
a poison that ultimately saves lives.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.430
The original chemotherapy drug was a derivative
of mustard gas.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.860
During WWII, scientists noticed poison gas
exposure shrunk the lymph nodes and along

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.570
with it, it shrunk lymphoma, a malignant tumorous
growth of the lymph nodes.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.050
Even though it's a poison, it proved extremely
successful in treating cancers throughout

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.110
the mid 20th century.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.960
Today, chemotherapy is used to dramatically
improve survival rates for breast cancer,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.960
it is the primary form of treatment for cancers
of the blood, and has great success in the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.920
early stages of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.160
It’s often used before or after other treatments
for other types of cancers.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.440
For example, when cancerous cells are left
behind after surgery or radiation adjuvant

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.240
chemotherapy is used, whereas neoadjuvant
chemotherapy is used to shrink a tumor before

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.620
a surgery.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.770
Chemotherapy works by targeting cells that
divide rapidly, one of the hallmarks of malignant

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.970
tumors and other cancers.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.210
Like the chemotherapy drug, Etoposide is used
frequently to treat diseases like lung cancer,

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.960
Ewing’s Sarcoma, and lymphoma.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.350
According to a study published in the journal
Chemistry and Biology, the drug attacks the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.090
topoisomerase II enzyme which cancer and other
rapidly dividing cells depend on to unwind

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.090
DNA.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.770
By inhibiting this enzyme, the cell can’t
make DNA as well and thus the cell gets programed

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.240
for death, which in medical speak is called
apoptosis.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.190
But unfortunately, these kind of drugs don’t
target just cancer cells, they effect other

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.540
rapidly dividing cells in the body as well.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.740
Like hair follicles, which is why chemo patients
often lose their hair.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.550
Other common side effects, I’m sure you’ve
heard of include nausea and fatigue.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.209
As common as nausea is, it affects people
differently, perhaps because of their expectations.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.480
A study published in the journal Cancer found
that patients who think nausea is a “very

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.370
likely” side effect, experience it 5 times
more often than those who think it’s less

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.370
likely.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.980
According to the National Cancer Institute
up to 96% of chemotherapy patients experience

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.000
fatigue.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
People describe it as feeling "jet lagged
all the time."

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.110
Chemotherapy makes people tired because it
changes the endocrine system, circadian rhythms,

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.390
metabolism, and serotonin production.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:44.160
There is some evidence that antidepressants
and weirdly, exercise helps fight fatigue.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.880
Chemotherapy can also cause diarrhea, hearing
loss and even decreased sex drive.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.459
But will we one day treat cancer without chemotherapy?

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.200
Well, new treatments are paving the way.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.080
One study published in New England Journal
of Medicine found that molecularly targeted

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.780
drugs work just as well as chemotherapy without
many of the negative side effects.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.630
Rather than suppressing all fast growing cells,
targeted therapy works by honing in on specific

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.880
mechanisms cancer cells use to grow.

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.880
Basically it’s like hitting the bullseye
rather than spraying the wall full of bullets.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.410
As Dr. George Demetri, at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute told Time, the future lies

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.250
with personalized medicine where therapies
are targeted towards an individual’s cancer.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.630
When planning a strategy to fight against
a cancerous tumor, it’s helpful to know

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.060
what a tumor is.

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:52.099
I explain more in this episode right here?
