00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:01.702
 What I want to talk about in this video 

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:04.925
 Is the concept of "modified" 

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:07.180
 So, let's look at some examples of averages 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.018
 Which you have experienced most often in your daily life. 

00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:11.893
 If you drive your car in the way 

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:13.251
 I looked at the speedometer 

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.311
 You'll see him driving quickly 

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.452
 35 mph, for example (35 mph) 

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.020
 Where the mph characters you see mean 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.085
 35 miles 

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.859
 In the hour. 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.587
 Well, what does that mean? 

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:28.653
 That means the number of miles you travel every hour 

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:32.542
 If you continue driving at this rate. 

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:34.613
 That is, it can be a measure of speed: 

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:38.590
 Indicates the distance you travel in the unit of time. 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.654
 Mostly, when people talk about rates 

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:41.622
 That's what they're talking about 

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.421
 They talk about how much something happened 

00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.338
 Per unit of time. 

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.933
 And not necessarily a distance per unit time. 

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.842
 It may be an average income per hour 

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.366
 For an employee doing something 

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.153
 The staff member may say that he is paid 

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:59.613
 He earns $ 10, so he gets $ 10 

00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:01.251
 In fact, let me write the word dollars 

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:04.281
 Let unity become clearer 

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:08.304
 $ 10 per hour 

00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:11.814
 $ 10 per 

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:13.673
 $ 10 per hour 

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:15.545
 Again, this represents how much money 

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.890
 - And here we are not talking about the distance as before - 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.603
 How much money does an employee earn per unit of time? 

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.089
 Although the rates are always seen 

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:25.639
 As the amount of time something happens for each unit of time 

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.415
 It can be miles per hour, 

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:29.325
 Or Amtara per second, 

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:30.977
 Or as in this case, it can be a staff wage. 

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:32.552
 It will be a dollar per hour, 

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:35.592
 However, the rates are not necessarily confined to these units. 

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:38.072
 In fact, you might say for example: "Well, 

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:40.713
 I love a certain kind of dessert, 

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:42.103
 But I am careful 

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:45.571
 Number of calories consumed " 

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.985
 Maybe you see somewhere 

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:53.155
 It has 200 calories 

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:57.083
 In each share 

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.633
 In each share 

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:01.051
 So this information tells us the number of calories 

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:02.069
 In each serving of dessert. 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.246
 Such information usually tells us the amount of the quota. 

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:06.226
 The quota could be Cuba or 8 ounces or any other amount. 

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.899
 So I can say: "Well, look, if you take two portions, 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.455
 Then I will consume 400 calories " 

00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.902
 "In the same way, if I worked for two hours, I would get $ 20" 

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:15.544
 "Or if you move for two hours, 

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:17.453
 I will cut 70 miles " 

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:19.051
 If rates give you an idea 

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.082
 How fast something happened. 

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.995
 Or the amount of something happening 

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.955
 Each time something else happens. 

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:28.604
 Now, I can write averages 

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:31.692
 In a way that looks exactly like the proportion 

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:34.043
 There is a link between these two words (in English) 

00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:35.583
 In view of their spelling 

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.550
 RAT, RAT 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.459
 You see that their roots come from the same idea 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.034
 In fact, this rate here, 35 mph 

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:45.717
 Perhaps he came from a question: 

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:49.448
 "If you cut 35 miles in one hour 

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:51.133
 What is the ratio? " 

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.577
 Rate 

00:02:53.577 --> 00:02:56.385
 Mileage 

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.355
 To watches 

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.844
 Then she says "Well, I've cut 35" 

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:03.958
 "Mileage to hour ratio" 

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.297
 "Was 35 to 1" 

00:03:06.297 --> 00:03:07.657
 Or maybe it was 

00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:10.257
 70 to 2, or something like that 

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.840
 But in this case the ratio is reduced to 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.357
 35 to 1 

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:14.019
 So, the ratio 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.990
 You see it mostly written this way 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.624
 Or maybe you see it this way, you see it this way .. 

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.930
 Sometimes you may also see it written this way 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.876
 35 miles 

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:28.751
 On 1 hour 

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.333
 But in this way it is more like 

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.928
 The special case of the ratio which we call the "rate" 

00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:35.482
 Because this amount is the same: 35 

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.598
 Instead of writing "miles per hour" complete 

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:39.800
 Mostly you'll see a shortcut 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.338
 Mile / hour 

00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.794
 All these ideas are interrelated 

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:50.007
 If you know the ratio between the number of calories and quotas 

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.752
 Then you will be able to write 

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.151
 You will be able to express it on average 

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.521
 vice versa. 

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:57.907
 Why do we care about rates? 

00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:00.730
 Well, if we're talking about things like speed, for example 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.913
 Without rates, then it will be difficult to determine how much 

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:05.360
 The speed of things happening. 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.626
 In that case we would live in a world where we say: 

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:07.926
 "See, I'm faster than you" or 

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.818
 "It's faster than me" 

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:11.084
 But we are unable to identify 

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.846
 Their speed is exact. 

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:15.702
 While using averages, I can say: "Look, that person ran 

00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:17.760
 100 yards in 10 seconds " 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.745
 "Ran 10 meters per second" 

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:24.322
 We can determine exactly how quickly that thing happens 

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:26.357
 Or rate of occurrence. 

00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:28.987
 In this example, instead of saying: "A cup of this 

00:04:28.987 --> 00:04:33.567
 Will give you more energy, 

00:04:33.567 --> 00:04:35.046
 Or maybe it increases your weight more 

00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:38.220
 Of a cup of it "instead of these absolute comparisons 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.784
 Here you can really quantify things 

00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:42.799
 And when we study the rate 

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.652
 We will study the rate a lot in mathematics 

00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:46.694
 Will be essential in algebra 

00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:48.956
 When we look at the rate of change 

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.271
 Line For example, look at how fast it moves in the vertical direction 

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:54.391
 For its movement in the horizontal direction 

00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.318
 We will call it "tilt" 

00:04:56.318 --> 00:04:58.747
 You can even imagine the slope of a hill 

00:04:58.747 --> 00:05:02.294
 But the speed of escalation for your movement forward 

00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:04.190
 We will also look at the rates in detail 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.351
 When we are in calculus 

00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:08.251
 In fact, the origin of the science of differentiation 

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.762
 - which will be studied later in the secondary and first years at the university - 

00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:13.530
 Is the measurement of intraday averages 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.752
 That is, the speed of movement of something at the moment. 

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.643
 The rates are very pleasant too 

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:19.794
 Very very important 

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.467
 I can say that you are 

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:22.847
 If you care about life around you 

00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:24.287
 Even if only for the next few hours 

00:05:24.287 --> 00:05:25.494
 You'll see a lot more 

00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:28.222
 Plenty of rates.
