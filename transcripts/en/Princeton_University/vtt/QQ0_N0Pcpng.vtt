00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.290
SPEAKER 1: So my photo is
called Tuesday In London.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.880
I actually took
it-- on Tuesdays,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.120
I had my early modern art class.


00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.430
And that day we were actually
having class at Tate Modern.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.930
And so the picture I took was
when I was coming out of class

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.010
and going back to class
over the Thames River

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.950
on the Millennium Bridge.


00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.280
The fact that you have a
beautiful piece of architecture

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.840
just rising up in the
skyline and that contrast

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.150
between the old and the new.


00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.520
So I thought it would give
you a really good idea of what

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.450
London is all about.


00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.600 position:97%
 


00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.860
SPEAKER 2: So we are
staying in the mountains.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.500
And we decide to
do a gaucho ride

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.680
and just spend about two hours
riding through the mountains.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.860
And so I was there
with my camera just

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.770
snapping away at anything I saw.


00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.650
And this photo came about
when I let my camera rest

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.660
as it was hanging
around my neck.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.930
And as I look through
it, I saw, oh, it's

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.760
actually a nice king of
frame within a frame.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.940
And so I snapped and that
is how it came about.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.740 position:97%
 


00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.990
SPEAKER 3: When I was up
there on top of the mountain,

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.510
I wanted to try to capture
the entire scene, which

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.830
is nearly impossible to do.


00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.170
So there was an option
on the phone at the time

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.800
that you could take
an aerial view.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.920
So you essentially just
captured every scene around you,

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.090
above you, and below you
forming a globe-like picture.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.080
It somehow managed to
make the part of Tenerife

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.520
that I was at look like
it's own individual world,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.300
little country.


00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.080 position:97%
 


00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.250
SPEAKER 4: I want to become
a foreign correspondent.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.980
And that's directly because of
having taken journalism classes

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.190
here and then
being able to apply

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.160
some of the lessons
learned, especially

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.810
in terms of the on-the-ground
ethical behaviors

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.600
that are necessary.


00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.240 position:97%
 


00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.820
SPEAKER 5: Through
the global seminar,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.620
through environmental and
scientific filmmaking,

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.540
I felt that my experience,
my artistic experience,

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.900
and my artistic eye along
with my course work in science

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.610
and my interest in
science, I was finally

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.010
able to sort of marry these two
disciplines into something that

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.420
was incredibly fun and
engaging to work on.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:49.020
