00:00:00.086 --> 00:00:01.486
- [Voiceover] So we've already started to

00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:03.367
familiarize ourselves
with the notion of charge.

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:06.455
We've seen that if two
things have the same charge,

00:00:06.455 --> 00:00:08.312
so they're either both positive,

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.773
or they are both negative,

00:00:10.773 --> 00:00:13.142
then they are going to repel each other.

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:15.022
So in either of these cases

00:00:15.022 --> 00:00:17.321
these things are going
to repel each other.

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:18.622
But if they have different charges,

00:00:18.622 --> 00:00:19.945
they are going to attract each other.

00:00:19.945 --> 00:00:23.535
So if I have a positive
and I have a negative

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:25.007
they are going to attract each other.

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.613
This charge is a property of matter

00:00:27.613 --> 00:00:28.722
that we've started to observe.

00:00:28.722 --> 00:00:31.089
We've started to observe of
how these different charges,

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:32.329
this framework that we've created,

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.659
how these things start to
interact with each other.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.337
So these things are going to,

00:00:36.337 --> 00:00:39.194
these two things are going
to attract each other.

00:00:39.194 --> 00:00:42.471
But the question is, what causes,

00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.650
how can we predict how strong the force

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:47.320
of attraction or repulsion is going to be

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.363
between charged particles?

00:00:49.363 --> 00:00:51.918
And this was a question
people have noticed,

00:00:51.918 --> 00:00:53.844
I guess what you could
call electrostatics,

00:00:53.844 --> 00:00:57.583
for a large swathe of
recorded human history.

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.673
But it wasn't until the 16 hundreds

00:00:59.673 --> 00:01:01.109
and especially the 17 hundreds,

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.761
that people started to seriously view this

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:05.261
as something that they could manipulate

00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:07.892
and even start to predict
in a kind of serious,

00:01:07.892 --> 00:01:10.098
mathematical, scientific way.

00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:12.725
And it wasn't until
1785, and there were many

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:13.584
that came before Coulomb,

00:01:13.584 --> 00:01:17.235
but in 1785 Coulomb formally published

00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:20.010
what is known as Coulomb's law.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.536
And the purpose of Coulomb's law,

00:01:22.536 --> 00:01:24.355
Coulomb's law,

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:28.047
is to predict what is
going to be the force of

00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:31.321
the electrostatic force
of attraction or repulsion

00:01:31.321 --> 00:01:33.271
between two forces.

00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:35.407
And so in Coulomb's law, what it states is

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:36.917
is if I have two charges,

00:01:36.917 --> 00:01:39.440
so let me, let's say this
charge right over here,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.407
and I'm gonna make it in white,

00:01:40.407 --> 00:01:41.862
because it could be positive or negative,

00:01:41.862 --> 00:01:45.113
but I'll just make it q
one, it has some charge.

00:01:45.113 --> 00:01:47.783
And then I have in Coulombs.

00:01:47.783 --> 00:01:50.709
and then another charge
q two right over here.

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.195
Another charge, q two.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.468
And then I have the distance
between them being r.

00:01:55.468 --> 00:01:58.872
So the distance between these two charges

00:01:58.872 --> 00:02:01.313
is going to be r.

00:02:01.313 --> 00:02:05.314
Coulomb's law states that the force,

00:02:05.314 --> 00:02:06.870
that the magnitude of the force,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.005
so it could be a repulsive force

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:10.515
or it could be an attractive force,

00:02:10.515 --> 00:02:12.512
which would tell us the
direction of the force

00:02:12.512 --> 00:02:14.114
between the two charges,

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:15.739
but the magnitude of the force,

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.456
which I'll just write it as F,

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:20.423
the magnitude of the electrostatic force,

00:02:20.423 --> 00:02:21.822
I'll write this sub e here,

00:02:21.822 --> 00:02:23.624
this subscript e for electrostatic.

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:25.630
Coulomb stated, well this is going to be,

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.697
and he tested this, he didn't
just kind of guess this.

00:02:27.697 --> 00:02:30.739
People actually were assuming
that it had something

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.732
to do with the products of the magnitude

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:37.305
of the charges and that as the particles

00:02:37.305 --> 00:02:38.680
got further and further away

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.653
the electrostatic force dissipated.

00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:42.418
But he was able to actually measure this

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:44.856
and feel really good
about stating this law.

00:02:44.856 --> 00:02:47.317
Saying that the magnitude
of the electrostatic force

00:02:47.317 --> 00:02:49.012
is proportional,

00:02:49.012 --> 00:02:50.800
is proportional,

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.958
to the product of the
magnitudes of the charges.

00:02:53.958 --> 00:02:58.532
So I could write this
as q one times q two,

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:00.343
and I could take the
absolute value of each,

00:03:00.343 --> 00:03:01.693
which is the same thing as just

00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:03.563
taking the absolute value of the product.

00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:05.335
Here's why I'm taking the
absolute value of the product,

00:03:05.335 --> 00:03:06.914
well, if they're different charges,

00:03:06.914 --> 00:03:08.121
this will be a negative number,

00:03:08.121 --> 00:03:10.907
but we just want the overall
magnitude of the force.

00:03:10.907 --> 00:03:12.417
So we could take, it's proportional to

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:15.063
the absolute value of the
product of the charges

00:03:15.063 --> 00:03:17.214
and it's inversely proportional to

00:03:17.214 --> 00:03:18.965
not just the distance between them,

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:23.167
not just to r, but to the
square of the distance.

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:25.884
The square of the distance between them.

00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:27.323
And what's pretty neat about this

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:31.550
is how close it mirrors
Newton's law of gravitation.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.856
Newton's law of gravitation,
we know that the force,

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:37.447
due to gravity between two masses,

00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:40.117
remember mass is just
another property of matter,

00:03:40.117 --> 00:03:42.554
that we sometimes feel is
a little bit more tangible

00:03:42.554 --> 00:03:45.342
because it feels like we can
kind of see weight and volume,

00:03:45.342 --> 00:03:46.897
but that's not quite the same,

00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:50.766
or we feel like we can feel or

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.818
internalize things like weight and volume

00:03:52.818 --> 00:03:54.281
which are related to mass,

00:03:54.281 --> 00:03:56.394
but in some ways it is
just another property,

00:03:56.394 --> 00:03:58.043
another property, especially
as you get into more

00:03:58.043 --> 00:04:00.463
of a kind of fancy physics.

00:04:00.463 --> 00:04:04.483
Our everyday notion of even mass starts to

00:04:04.483 --> 00:04:06.053
become a lot more interesting.

00:04:06.053 --> 00:04:07.937
But Newton's law of gravitation says,

00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:09.595
look the magnitude of the force of gravity

00:04:09.595 --> 00:04:12.322
between two masses is going
to be proportional to,

00:04:12.322 --> 00:04:14.459
by Newton's, by the gravitational concept,

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.686
proportional to the
product of the two masses.

00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:19.242
Actually, let me do it
in those same colors

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:21.957
so you can see the relationship.

00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:25.033
It's going to be proportional to

00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:28.971
the product of the two
masses, m one m two.

00:04:28.971 --> 00:04:30.782
And it's going to be
inversely proportional

00:04:30.782 --> 00:04:32.895
to the square of the distance.

00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:35.820
The square of the distance
between two masses.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.562
Now these proportional
personality constants

00:04:37.562 --> 00:04:39.442
are very different. Gravitational force,

00:04:39.442 --> 00:04:42.628
we kind of perceive this
is as acting, being strong,

00:04:42.628 --> 00:04:45.236
it's a weaker force in close range.

00:04:45.236 --> 00:04:47.186
But we kind of imagine it
as kind of what dictates

00:04:47.186 --> 00:04:49.386
what happens in the,

00:04:49.386 --> 00:04:52.086
amongst the stars and
the planets and moons.

00:04:52.086 --> 00:04:54.199
While the electrostatic
force at close range

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.500
is a much stronger force.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.495
It can overcome the
gravitational force very easily.

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.143
But it's what we consider happening

00:05:00.143 --> 00:05:03.347
at either an atomic level
or kind of at a scale

00:05:03.347 --> 00:05:06.482
that we are more familiar to operating at.

00:05:06.482 --> 00:05:08.433
But needless to say,
it is very interesting

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:12.078
to see how this parallel
between these two things,

00:05:12.078 --> 00:05:14.795
it's kind of these
patterns in the universe.

00:05:14.795 --> 00:05:16.884
But with that said, let's actually apply

00:05:16.884 --> 00:05:18.510
let's actually apply Coulomb's law,

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.761
just to make sure we feel
comfortable with the mathematics.

00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:24.454
So let's say that I have a charge here.

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:26.752
Let's say that I have a charge here,

00:05:26.752 --> 00:05:29.353
and it has a positive
charge of, I don't know,

00:05:29.353 --> 00:05:32.092
let's say it is positive five

00:05:32.092 --> 00:05:36.606
times 10 to the negative three Coulombs.

00:05:36.606 --> 00:05:40.173
So that's this one right over here.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:41.449
That's its charge.

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.490
And let's say I have this
other charge right over here

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.766
and this has a negative charge.

00:05:47.766 --> 00:05:49.206
And it is going to be,

00:05:49.206 --> 00:05:53.408
it is going to be, let's
say it's negative one...

00:05:53.408 --> 00:05:57.404
Negative one times 10

00:05:57.404 --> 00:06:01.048
to the negative one Coulombs.

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:03.230
And let's say that the
distance between the two,

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:05.565
let's that this distance right here

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:10.393
is 0.5 meters.

00:06:10.393 --> 00:06:14.254
So given that, let's figure out what the

00:06:14.254 --> 00:06:15.717
what the electrostatic force

00:06:15.717 --> 00:06:17.126
between these two are going to be.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:17.946
And we can already predict that

00:06:17.946 --> 00:06:19.363
it's going to be an
attractive force because

00:06:19.363 --> 00:06:20.778
they have different signs.

00:06:20.778 --> 00:06:22.010
And that was actually
part of Coulomb's law.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.287
This is the magnitude of the force,

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.386
if these have different
signs, it's attractive,

00:06:25.386 --> 00:06:27.280
if they have the same sign then they

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.905
are going to repel each other.

00:06:28.905 --> 00:06:29.672
And I know what you're saying,

00:06:29.672 --> 00:06:30.665
"Well in order to actually calculate it,

00:06:30.665 --> 00:06:32.481
"I need to know what K is."

00:06:32.481 --> 00:06:35.628
What is this electrostatic constant?

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:39.099
What is this electrostatic
constant going to actually be?

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:42.025
And so you can measure that
with a lot of precision,

00:06:42.025 --> 00:06:44.137
and we have kind of modern numbers on it,

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.322
but the electrostatic constant,

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.086
especially for the sake of this problem,

00:06:47.086 --> 00:06:52.086
I mean if we were to get
really precise it's 8.987551,

00:06:52.102 --> 00:06:55.445
we could keep gone on and
on times 10 to the ninth.

00:06:55.445 --> 00:06:59.578
But for the sake of our
little example here,

00:06:59.578 --> 00:07:00.902
where we really only have

00:07:00.902 --> 00:07:02.457
one significant digit for each of these.

00:07:02.457 --> 00:07:04.105
Let's just get an approximation,

00:07:04.105 --> 00:07:05.406
it'll make the math a little bit easier,

00:07:05.406 --> 00:07:07.263
I won't have to get a calculator out,

00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:08.401
let's just say it's approximately

00:07:08.401 --> 00:07:11.157
nine times 10 to the ninth.

00:07:11.157 --> 00:07:14.346
Nine times 10 to the ninth.

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:18.223
Nine times, actually let me
make sure it says approximately,

00:07:18.223 --> 00:07:19.638
because I am approximating here,

00:07:19.638 --> 00:07:21.869
nine times 10 to the ninth.

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:23.726
And what are the units going to be?

00:07:23.726 --> 00:07:25.282
Well in the numerator here,

00:07:25.282 --> 00:07:26.884
where I multiply Coulombs times Coulombs,

00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:29.020
I'm going to get Coulombs squared.

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.831
This right over here is going to give me,

00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:33.873
that's gonna give me Coulombs squared.

00:07:33.873 --> 00:07:35.312
And this down over here is going

00:07:35.312 --> 00:07:37.565
to give me meters squared.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:39.491
This is going to give me meters squared.

00:07:39.491 --> 00:07:41.117
And what I want is to get rid of

00:07:41.117 --> 00:07:42.486
the Coulombs and the meters and end up

00:07:42.486 --> 00:07:43.904
with just the Newtons.

00:07:43.904 --> 00:07:47.065
And so the units here are actually,

00:07:47.065 --> 00:07:49.732
the units here are Newtons.

00:07:49.732 --> 00:07:52.332
Newton and then meters squared,

00:07:52.332 --> 00:07:53.563
and that cancels out
with the meters squared

00:07:53.563 --> 00:07:55.095
in the denominator.

00:07:55.095 --> 00:07:59.617
Newton meter squared over Coulomb squared.

00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:02.592
Over, over Coulomb squared.

00:08:02.592 --> 00:08:04.307
Let me do that in white.

00:08:04.307 --> 00:08:08.241
Over, over Coulomb squared.

00:08:08.241 --> 00:08:10.135
So, these meter squared will cancel those.

00:08:10.135 --> 00:08:11.625
Those Coulomb squared in the denomin...

00:08:11.625 --> 00:08:13.061
over here will cancel with those,

00:08:13.061 --> 00:08:14.500
and you'll be just left with Newtons.

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.244
But let's actually do that.

00:08:15.244 --> 00:08:16.706
Let's apply it to this example.

00:08:16.706 --> 00:08:17.867
I encourage you to pause the video

00:08:17.867 --> 00:08:20.654
and apply this information
to Coulomb's law

00:08:20.654 --> 00:08:22.279
and figure out what
the electrostatic force

00:08:22.279 --> 00:08:25.089
between these two
particles is going to be.

00:08:25.089 --> 00:08:27.387
So I'm assuming you've had your go at it.

00:08:27.387 --> 00:08:29.244
So it is going to be, and this is really

00:08:29.244 --> 00:08:31.590
just applying the formula.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:34.097
It's going to be nine
times 10 to the ninth,

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.675
nine times 10 to the ninth,

00:08:36.675 --> 00:08:37.882
and I'll write the units here,

00:08:37.882 --> 00:08:41.922
Newtons meter squared
over Coulomb squared.

00:08:41.922 --> 00:08:44.824
And then q one times q two,
so this is going to be,

00:08:44.824 --> 00:08:46.497
let's see, this is going to be,

00:08:46.497 --> 00:08:48.396
actually let me just write
it all out for this first

00:08:48.396 --> 00:08:49.910
this first time.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.810
So it's going to be times five times ten

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.480
to the negative three Coulombs.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:00.148
Times, times negative one.

00:09:00.148 --> 00:09:02.704
Time ten to the negative one Coulombs

00:09:02.704 --> 00:09:04.120
and we're going to take
the absolute value of this

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.837
so that negative is going to go away.

00:09:06.837 --> 00:09:10.621
All of that over, all of that over

00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:12.920
and we're in kind of the
home stretch right over here,

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.569
0.5 meters squared.

00:09:14.569 --> 00:09:18.991
0.5 meters squared.

00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.790
And so, let's just do a
little bit of the math here.

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:24.669
So first of all, let's look at the units.

00:09:24.669 --> 00:09:25.955
So we have Coulomb squared here,

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:27.757
then we're going to have
Coulombs times Coulombs there

00:09:27.757 --> 00:09:29.591
that's Coulombs squared
divided by Coulombs squared

00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:31.984
that's going to cancel with that and that.

00:09:31.984 --> 00:09:34.049
You have meters squared here,

00:09:34.049 --> 00:09:35.349
and actually let me just write it out,

00:09:35.349 --> 00:09:37.356
so the numerator, in the numerator,

00:09:37.356 --> 00:09:39.367
we are going to have

00:09:39.367 --> 00:09:42.717
so if we just say nine times five

00:09:42.717 --> 00:09:44.336
times, when we take the absolute value,

00:09:44.336 --> 00:09:45.218
it's just going to be one.

00:09:45.218 --> 00:09:46.634
So nine times five is going to be,

00:09:46.634 --> 00:09:47.910
nine times five times negative...

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.676
five times negative one is negative five,

00:09:49.676 --> 00:09:50.975
but the absolute value there,

00:09:50.975 --> 00:09:52.857
so it's just going to be five times nine.

00:09:52.857 --> 00:09:55.427
So it's going to be 45

00:09:55.427 --> 00:09:58.955
times 10 to the nine,

00:09:58.955 --> 00:10:02.005
minus three, minus one.

00:10:02.005 --> 00:10:04.313
So six five,

00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:07.639
so that's going to be 10 to the fifth,

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:10.457
10 to the fifth, the Coulombs
already cancelled out,

00:10:10.457 --> 00:10:15.203
and we're going to have
Newton meter squared over,

00:10:15.203 --> 00:10:20.203
over 0.25

00:10:20.312 --> 00:10:22.562
meters squared. These cancel.

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:24.305
And so we are left with,

00:10:24.305 --> 00:10:26.302
well if you divide by 0.25,

00:10:26.302 --> 00:10:28.183
that's the same thing as dividing by 1/4,

00:10:28.183 --> 00:10:30.458
which is the same thing
as multiplying by four.

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:32.567
So if you multiply this times four,

00:10:32.567 --> 00:10:37.330
45 times four is 160

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.677
plus 20 is equal to 180

00:10:40.677 --> 00:10:44.088
times 10 to the fifth Newtons.

00:10:44.088 --> 00:10:46.015
And if we wanted to write
it in scientific notation,

00:10:46.015 --> 00:10:48.802
well we could divide this by,

00:10:48.802 --> 00:10:51.959
we could divide this by 100
and then multiply this by 100

00:10:51.959 --> 00:10:55.456
and so you could write this as 1.80

00:10:55.456 --> 00:10:57.478
times one point...

00:10:57.478 --> 00:10:58.948
and actually I don't
wanna make it look like

00:10:58.948 --> 00:11:00.805
I have more significant
digits than I really have.

00:11:00.805 --> 00:11:03.553
1.8 times

00:11:03.553 --> 00:11:07.085
10 to the seventh,

00:11:07.085 --> 00:11:09.049
times 10 to the seventh units,

00:11:09.049 --> 00:11:11.883
I just divided this by 100
and I multiplied this by 100.

00:11:11.883 --> 00:11:12.796
And we're done.

00:11:12.796 --> 00:11:15.675
This is the magnitude of
the electrostatic force

00:11:15.675 --> 00:11:18.369
between those two particles.

00:11:18.369 --> 00:11:19.970
And it looks like it's fairly significant,

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.132
and this is actually a good amount,

00:11:21.132 --> 00:11:22.711
and that's because this is
actually a good amount of charge,

00:11:22.711 --> 00:11:23.872
a lot of charge.

00:11:23.872 --> 00:11:27.354
Especially at this
distance right over here.

00:11:27.354 --> 00:11:28.933
And the next thing we have to think about,

00:11:28.933 --> 00:11:31.533
well if we want not just the magnitude,

00:11:31.533 --> 00:11:33.042
we also want the direction,

00:11:33.042 --> 00:11:34.014
well, they're different charges.

00:11:34.014 --> 00:11:36.011
So this is going to be
an attractive force.

00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:38.750
This is going to be an
attractive force on each of them

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:42.326
acting at 1.8 times ten
to the seventh Newtons.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:45.368
If they were the same charge,
it would be a repulsive force,

00:11:45.368 --> 00:11:48.176
or they would repel each
other with this force.

00:11:48.176 --> 00:11:50.042
But we're done.
