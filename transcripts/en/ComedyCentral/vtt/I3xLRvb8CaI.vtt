- My brother's on the cheese,
my brother's on the cheese.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:26.893
What's up ComicCon?

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:27.994

You ready to see the
Workaholics out here?

00:00:36.903 --> 00:00:40.340
(audience cheers)

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.574
That's not loud enough.

00:00:41.574 --> 00:00:42.909 align:start size:84% position:16%
Let's hear it a
little louder here.

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:44.744
Let's make some noise.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:52.152
My brother's on the cheese,
my brother's on the cheese.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:53.620

Let's make some noise!

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:22.849
(audience cheers)

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:37.964
- What's up?

00:01:37.964 --> 00:01:40.133
(mumbles)

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:46.739
- I'm very sorry about that.

00:01:46.739 --> 00:01:49.008
This is very exciting guys.

00:01:49.008 --> 00:01:52.212
It's so great to be able
to talk to you today and

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:54.747
interview you guys here today.

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:56.649
- I want to get to
know some people.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:57.617
- This dude is just eating.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:58.451
Hey, check out the dude in

00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.786
the corner just eating.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.554
- Get it boys.

00:02:01.554 --> 00:02:02.989
- Hey, what are you guys eating?

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:03.890
What is it?

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:07.861
- It's a sandwich.

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.664
Give it up for sandwiches!

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.666
(audience cheers)

00:02:13.666 --> 00:02:17.036
- This Comiccon panel
goes out to sandwiches.

00:02:17.036 --> 00:02:19.539
- So guys, when you're in
a situation like this, you

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:21.107
started out you're friends.

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:24.844
You started the show together
and now you've got this tit

00:02:24.844 --> 00:02:28.448
show and now you've got all
of do you pinch yourselves

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:31.384 align:start position:0%
sometimes and say look at this,
how did this amazing thing

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:32.352
happen?

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.553
- We pinch each other.

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:36.656 align:start size:81% position:19%
It's a game we
play when no one's

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.159 align:start size:88% position:13%
looking and I just
told you guys about it.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.093
- It's a late night game.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.262
A very, very, very late night

00:02:42.262 --> 00:02:46.900 align:start position:0%
game that we play where we pinch
each other until we bruise.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.768
- Yeah, it's the morning
actually if it's that late.

00:02:48.768 --> 00:02:50.803
- That's how late it is.

00:02:50.803 --> 00:02:52.839
No, it's super, crazy surreal.

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:55.742
Well, Roseanne Barr
just came up to us.

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:57.243
- Yeah.

00:02:57.243 --> 00:02:59.913 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Like 15 minutes ago and
was like my kid is a big fan,

00:02:59.913 --> 00:03:01.748
I have no idea who you
are, but my kid is a fan.

00:03:01.748 --> 00:03:03.016
(audience laughs)

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:05.451
And that still was very cool.

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.688 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I like how on that show,
remember how they switched out

00:03:08.688 --> 00:03:09.889
the Becky's on us?

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.124
- Yeah.

00:03:11.124 --> 00:03:12.058
- Like we weren't
going to notice.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:13.393
That was the coolest shit.

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:14.294
- Who's team Leesie?

00:03:14.294 --> 00:03:15.328
Team Leesie?

00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.563
The first one?

00:03:16.563 --> 00:03:17.931
- No, 'cause she's the
first one, original.

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.399
- Yeah, Sarah Chalk.

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.233
Chalkie?

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.167
Chalk?

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:22.168
- Nah, not me.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:23.369
- This is our transition into

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:25.471 align:start size:84% position:16%
saying we're
switching out Carl's.

00:03:25.471 --> 00:03:27.040
- Yeah, we're going
to flip out Carl.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.274
- Goodbye.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.143 align:start size:81% position:19%
- It's going to
be Louie Anderson.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:31.611
- Yeah!

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:32.745
Family Feud!

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.680
- I think it's a step up.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.281
- Every week it'll change.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:37.584
Tom will give you an ep as Carl.

00:03:37.584 --> 00:03:38.851
- You like Carl?

00:03:38.851 --> 00:03:40.086
- That would actually,
that'd be pretty good.

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:42.755
- You'd make a great Carl.

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.158
- Now, you guys all
still live together?

00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:46.559
- No, no.

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:48.061
Thank God.

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:49.529
- No, you're not all living
together anymore now that the

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.298 align:start size:97% position:3%
show's a hit, you all moved
out to separate houses?

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:53.132
Or?

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.434
- Yeah, we just moved.

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:56.336
Blake and I lived
together up until

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.770
about four months ago.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.339
Which is weird.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:03.476
People were like you guys are
gay dudes together, right?

00:04:03.476 --> 00:04:05.311
(audience laughs)

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.447
You guys are gay dudes.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.715
- No haha.

00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:09.749 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Which, it's a
lifestyle you know?

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.251
Don't judge us.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:12.785
We so finally just moved on.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.854
But we lived together for like
seven years, and before that,

00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.223 align:start size:97% position:3%
Kyle and I and Blake all lived
in the house that we shoot

00:04:17.223 --> 00:04:18.858
Workaholics in.

00:04:18.858 --> 00:04:22.095
Which was a very
weird first season.

00:04:22.095 --> 00:04:23.396
We're saving a lot of money.

00:04:23.396 --> 00:04:24.897
- Yeah, that was so weird.

00:04:24.897 --> 00:04:27.634
- We were convinced, oh we'll
do one season, get canceled,

00:04:27.634 --> 00:04:30.903 align:start size:97% position:3%
and 'cause we're going to
say tight butthole on TV and

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.138
they're immediately
going to cancel us.

00:04:32.138 --> 00:04:33.606
- Nobody's gonna like it, yeah.

00:04:33.606 --> 00:04:36.142
- And then, oh, some
tight butthole fans.

00:04:36.142 --> 00:04:37.410
Okay cool.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:38.745
(audience applauds)

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:39.712
- Tight butthole.

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:40.546
Keep it tight.

00:04:40.546 --> 00:04:42.081
Who would have known?

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.250
- Hey everybody here is a
tight butthole fan, right?

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.084
Yeah.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.289
- Put your hands up if
you like tight buttholes.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.558 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Hands up if you
like tight buttholes.

00:04:54.093 --> 00:04:57.163
- See mom, I told
you they'd like it.

00:04:58.231 --> 00:04:59.465
- Told you.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:00.900
I don't think that's
going to catch on.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.672 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Now what is the back
story behind tight butthole?

00:05:05.672 --> 00:05:09.175 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's actually pre-dates
the existence of Workaholics,

00:05:09.175 --> 00:05:10.610
which is even weirder.

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.844
- Well, you know
Lisa Ann, right?

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:14.614
- Yeah, it's based
on her butthole.

00:05:14.614 --> 00:05:17.684 align:start size:97% position:3%
It was, we were talking about
how people say like tits

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:22.488 align:start size:94% position:6%
instead of cool, which
just seems like, you know?

00:05:22.488 --> 00:05:24.190 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Which is disgusting
by the way.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.426
- Yes, inappropriate.

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.260
- Chauvinist.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.695
But it seems arbitrary.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.196 align:start size:97% position:3%
It's like yeah, tits are
cool, but you can say anything

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:34.367
you can say tight butthole
and it's like maybe we will.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:36.235
- Wait a second, wait a second.

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.838
- It still gets me too.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.039
- What's the, wait a minute,

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.175 align:start size:84% position:16%
so you write the
show together right?

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:43.409
How do you do that?

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.378
Do you go sit in a room
and go through ideas?

00:05:45.378 --> 00:05:46.612 align:start size:81% position:19%
- We sit in a room
just like this.

00:05:46.612 --> 00:05:48.314
It's the exact same
size as the room.

00:05:48.314 --> 00:05:52.485
- With rats and cereal and
we just josh each other.

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:54.687
- So much joshing.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:55.521
It's a lot of joshing.

00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.523
- Yup, non-stop joshuas.

00:05:58.958 --> 00:06:01.928
- Has anyone ever had like
a hidden camera reality show

00:06:01.928 --> 00:06:06.733
where the host is named Josh
and it's called Just Joshing?

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.101
- That's gotta happen.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:08.935
- Well, it's mine.

00:06:08.935 --> 00:06:11.037
I said it here.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:12.605
- Where's Josh Gad?

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:18.644
- He's got a tight butthole.

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:22.815
- I think you're
saying it out of,

00:06:22.815 --> 00:06:24.050
that's not the proper context.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.451 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I invited it so I
can say it how I want.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.853 align:start position:0%
- Yeah, I think you're supposed
to say like something is

00:06:26.853 --> 00:06:29.455 align:start position:0%
tight butthole, not the
specifics about his actual anus.

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.923
- Gross.

00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.558
- But what are we to do if
we really want to explain how

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:35.995 align:start size:84% position:16%
actually tight
someone's rectum is?

00:06:35.995 --> 00:06:37.096
- It's a tight rectum.

00:06:37.096 --> 00:06:38.264
- There we go!

00:06:39.198 --> 00:06:41.234
- Josh Gad, tight rectum.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.403
- And he is, tight butthole.

00:06:43.403 --> 00:06:44.237
- Yes.

00:06:44.237 --> 00:06:45.638
- Okay, I'm catching up.

00:06:45.638 --> 00:06:49.876 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And, coming this fall,
he'll be joshing you.

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:52.111
- That's a good idea for a show.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:55.348
- Kyle, was it hard
directing these guys?

00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:56.182
- Yeah.

00:06:56.182 --> 00:06:57.016
It's the worst.

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:57.850
These guys are divas.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.519
- Scuze me?

00:06:59.519 --> 00:07:00.720
- No we're not!

00:07:03.122 --> 00:07:04.590
- It's a lot of fun.

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:06.893 align:start position:0%
Honestly, these guys are my
best friends in the whole world

00:07:06.893 --> 00:07:09.395
and we get to work every day
together and we just get to

00:07:09.395 --> 00:07:10.229
make each other laugh.

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.397
- Awww.

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:14.333 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I'm sorry, I'm
totally going to cry.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:15.501
- You said you wouldn't cry.

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:16.769
- I didn't mean to.

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:19.038 align:start size:84% position:16%
I said I wouldn't
cry, but fuck it man.

00:07:19.038 --> 00:07:20.740
They need to know how I feel.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.742
- Are you really crying?

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:28.915
- It's hard keeping the has
your friendships improved

00:07:28.915 --> 00:07:30.983
since the success of the show?

00:07:30.983 --> 00:07:33.352
Sometimes it's hard,
the pressures of fame.

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:34.187
Has that changed?

00:07:34.187 --> 00:07:35.021
Anything?

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:35.855
- Oh yeah.

00:07:35.855 --> 00:07:36.789
We're so tight now.

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:38.391
We like buy each other ice.

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:41.561 align:start position:0%
We don't wear it, it's strictly
around the house kind of

00:07:41.561 --> 00:07:43.396
stuff like Drake does.

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.566
- Well, no new friends,
he taught us that so.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:47.533
We're stuck with each other.

00:07:47.533 --> 00:07:49.068
- No new friends.

00:07:49.068 --> 00:07:50.803
I'll meet all of you, but
as far as friendship goes,

00:07:50.803 --> 00:07:51.804
staying right here.

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:52.638
- Not gonna happen.

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:53.539
Sorry guys.

00:07:54.974 --> 00:07:57.610
- It is pretty cool though, I
don't know, we've been doing

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:00.947
this a while, we started off
doing YouTube videos together.

00:08:00.947 --> 00:08:02.148
- You guys heard of YouTube?

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:03.015
- Yeah, have you
guys heard of this?

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:03.983
It's a website.

00:08:03.983 --> 00:08:06.552
- You guys heard of YouTube?

00:08:06.552 --> 00:08:09.655
If you've heard of
YouTube, say yeah.

00:08:11.624 --> 00:08:12.825
It's amazing.

00:08:12.825 --> 00:08:14.894 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Great, I like how only
40 people said yeah.

00:08:14.894 --> 00:08:17.630
Everybody else was like
I'm not saying that shit,

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:19.031
obviously I know about YouTube.

00:08:19.031 --> 00:08:20.633
(audience laughs)

00:08:20.633 --> 00:08:23.569
I obviously know
about YouTube, Tom.

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:24.670
Come on, Tom.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:29.909
Yeah, I mean it's cool that
we get to go to work with

00:08:31.677 --> 00:08:34.747 align:start size:84% position:16%
our best friends
and write a tv show.

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:38.317 align:start size:88% position:13%
So, it's, thank you guys
so much for watching.

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:39.552
- Yeah, thank you.

00:08:39.552 --> 00:08:42.154
- A lot of word play, a
little bit of writing.

00:08:42.154 --> 00:08:44.123
- Yeah give yourselves
a round of applause.

00:08:44.123 --> 00:08:45.525
- Yeah, honestly.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.161
Actually, we'll clap for you.

00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:52.031
- It's the same 40 people.

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:54.534
- Yeah, there's not a
lot of participation.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:56.435 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What's the biggest
change, you start out making

00:08:56.435 --> 00:08:59.906 align:start size:97% position:3%
YouTube videos, you don't have
a big budget, now you have

00:08:59.906 --> 00:09:02.475 align:start position:0%
this big network budget, what's
the biggest change when you

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:05.578 align:start size:97% position:3%
got all this money to spend
on the show and stuff?

00:09:05.578 --> 00:09:07.747
- Well, we could turn
you into a Cyborg.

00:09:07.747 --> 00:09:08.981
- Yeah, did you see your laser?

00:09:08.981 --> 00:09:10.883
- The laser beam sword.

00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:14.921
Light saber.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:17.223
- Now we can do that.

00:09:17.223 --> 00:09:18.891
Before we were putting like

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:23.029 align:start size:97% position:3%
cryptonite locks on our
necks and we've elevated to

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:24.730
cool things like laser swords.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.932
Everyone should have one.

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.967
- Yeah, but it hasn't
changed that much.

00:09:27.967 --> 00:09:31.537
I mean, we still kind of
attack the comedy like we

00:09:31.537 --> 00:09:32.972
did when we started.

00:09:32.972 --> 00:09:34.273
- Damn right.

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:36.609
- We're still grinding guys.

00:09:37.944 --> 00:09:38.778
Hard.

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.047
We're grinding.

00:09:41.047 --> 00:09:43.215
You're going to get in
trouble over there lady,

00:09:43.215 --> 00:09:45.418
I'm hearing everything.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:46.919
Aight?

00:09:46.919 --> 00:09:50.590 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'm going to bite your
nipples off, girl.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.158
You watch it.

00:09:52.158 --> 00:09:55.461
- That just got crazy
violent very quickly.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:58.230
It went from like someone
might ask you to pipe down

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.032
to I'll bite your nipples off.

00:10:00.032 --> 00:10:02.201
- I'll bite your nipples.

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:03.035
- Woah dude.

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:03.970
- Cool your jets.

00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:06.439
- Hey Blake, how you feeling?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.108 align:start position:0%
You had that accident, you
jumped off a roof and hurt your,

00:10:09.108 --> 00:10:12.311
everyone heard about this I'm
sure, but how you feeling?

00:10:12.311 --> 00:10:14.614
- I feel great Tom.

00:10:14.614 --> 00:10:17.883
(audience laughs)

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.419
- Well, he broke his back for
those of you that don't know.

00:10:20.419 --> 00:10:21.854
- Yeah, snapped it.

00:10:21.854 --> 00:10:22.688
Whoopsies!

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.125 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah, he's got that like
Dr. Octagon spine now.

00:10:26.125 --> 00:10:27.326
- I do.

00:10:27.326 --> 00:10:29.962 align:start size:84% position:16%
I feel great though,
thank you, Tom.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.498
- How exactly did
that happen though?

00:10:32.498 --> 00:10:36.669 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I can't remember everything,
but I remember falling.

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It's like the Tom Petty
song is based on it.

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:41.607
- Yeah, Freefalling.

00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:43.142
- He went back in time.

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:47.346
- I was such a bad friend and
roommate too because he was

00:10:47.346 --> 00:10:49.415 align:start size:97% position:3%
like I think I might have
broke my back and I was like

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:50.249
no way.

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:57.023
I'm like here you just
chill out, go to bed,

00:10:57.023 --> 00:11:00.660
I'll keep partying and then
we'll look at it tomorrow.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:03.462
- Just drink a bunch
of Nyquil and shut up.

00:11:03.462 --> 00:11:06.532 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Chug this Nyquil
and go to bed.

00:11:06.532 --> 00:11:10.569
- Take these sleeping
pills, never wake up.

00:11:10.569 --> 00:11:11.404
His words.

00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:14.807
He's putting on a
face for you guys.

00:11:14.807 --> 00:11:15.641
He said that.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.475
I was there.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:17.309
- I didn't say that.

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:18.244
- He's an evil drunk.

00:11:18.244 --> 00:11:19.712
- I didn't say that verbatium.

00:11:19.712 --> 00:11:21.981
Yeah, I'm a murderer drunk.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:25.951 align:start position:0%
You know how like you get a
friend that gets like dumb drunk

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:26.786
or crazy drunk?

00:11:26.786 --> 00:11:28.788
I murder people.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.189
- It's cool.

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.457 align:start position:0%
It's like little shop of
horrors, but with your friends.

00:11:31.457 --> 00:11:32.792
It's like feed em people.

00:11:32.792 --> 00:11:35.261
- Yeah it's like a
Dexter situation.

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:37.363
I only kill other drunks.

00:11:39.965 --> 00:11:41.734
- What'd you say bro?

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:44.637
- What'd you say?

00:11:44.637 --> 00:11:46.706
- Hey jump off that roof.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:49.408
- I fucking will.

00:11:49.408 --> 00:11:50.810
- Whoopsies!

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:52.044
- Maybe I will.

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:56.148
- You didn't get it
on film, did you?

00:11:56.148 --> 00:11:57.116
Jumping off the roof?

00:11:57.116 --> 00:11:58.818
- No I think it's on YouTube.

00:11:58.818 --> 00:12:01.921 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You've heard of
YouTube, right guys?

00:12:03.322 --> 00:12:07.093
If you've heard of
YouTube, say yeah.

00:12:07.093 --> 00:12:08.327
- Alright!

00:12:08.327 --> 00:12:10.596
- Wow, so some people
Googled it and alright.

00:12:10.596 --> 00:12:12.598
- Yeah, the word is spreading.

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.934 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Maybe by the end of this
panel, everyone will know what

00:12:14.934 --> 00:12:15.768
YouTube is.

00:12:15.768 --> 00:12:17.236
That's cool, we learnt.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:19.138
Who would've thought you
came to Workaholics and you

00:12:19.138 --> 00:12:20.339
learnt something?

00:12:20.339 --> 00:12:21.974
- We're here to teach.

00:12:21.974 --> 00:12:24.710
Save your money, Google YouTube.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.945
- I'll bite your nipples off.

00:12:25.945 --> 00:12:27.747
(audience laughs)

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:29.949
- So you're writing
the next season now?

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:30.783
- Yeah, we are.

00:12:30.783 --> 00:12:32.051
- Any surprises?

00:12:32.051 --> 00:12:34.887
Anything you can let
slip now, or is that

00:12:34.887 --> 00:12:36.655
not the way it works?

00:12:39.492 --> 00:12:40.326
- Well.

00:12:42.695 --> 00:12:43.863
- We could but

00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:51.203
- Let's give people a little
tidbit about what's going to

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:53.372
happen next season.

00:12:53.372 --> 00:12:56.542
- There's a lot of
chicks this season.

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.379
- Oh Yeah, the chicks.

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.181
- So dudes, get ready.

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:07.253 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The guys almost
get laid this season.

00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:09.421 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The dudes are
getting hella sexual.

00:13:09.421 --> 00:13:13.592 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That's what happens the
more we go on, we're like we

00:13:15.027 --> 00:13:18.297
should have some more good
looking girls on set, right?

00:13:18.297 --> 00:13:22.168
What if like the dudes hooked
up with a ton of hot babes?

00:13:22.168 --> 00:13:24.036
- That's funny stuff.

00:13:24.036 --> 00:13:26.572
- Wouldn't it be hilarious
if like Adam would just sleep

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:29.241
with a ton of babes this season?

00:13:30.676 --> 00:13:32.978 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're off doing the
adventures, like meanwhile,

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.980
(moans)

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:39.385
- That's a good impression.

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:42.254
That's how I do it.

00:13:42.254 --> 00:13:43.189
I drop in.

00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:44.123
- What are we going to do?

00:13:44.123 --> 00:13:45.524
Alice is going to be here?

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:47.526
(moans)

00:13:57.069 --> 00:14:00.439 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't move anything
else but my nose.

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.010
- It sends sonar waves down.

00:14:06.178 --> 00:14:09.949
- Oh man, that guy
bangs like a rabbit.

00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:10.783
Literally.

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:14.053
- That's cool.

00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:16.789
So that's this season.

00:14:16.789 --> 00:14:18.824
- Yeah, there's a lot of that.

00:14:18.824 --> 00:14:20.392 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We're kind of, I mean,
we're still in the middle of

00:14:20.392 --> 00:14:24.597 align:start size:97% position:3%
writing everything, so we
don't know who will like guest

00:14:24.597 --> 00:14:26.031
stars we're going to get.

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.400 align:start size:97% position:3%
But, if I had to guess,
Denzel Washington, probably I

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.435
don't know.

00:14:29.435 --> 00:14:30.369
- Probably.

00:14:30.369 --> 00:14:31.670
- If I had to guess, Jamie Foxx.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:33.339
I don't know.

00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:34.940
Like maybe.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:36.508
- Taraji Henson?

00:14:36.508 --> 00:14:38.410 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't know who that
is, but definitely.

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.311
- She's good.

00:14:39.311 --> 00:14:40.379
She's good.

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:41.547
- Celine Dion maybe.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:43.415
- Possibly, we don't know.

00:14:43.415 --> 00:14:44.984
We haven't casted yet.

00:14:44.984 --> 00:14:46.218
- There's no way to tell.

00:14:46.218 --> 00:14:47.419
- More than likely,
none of those people.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:48.354
- Yeah.

00:14:48.354 --> 00:14:49.855
- So don't get your hopes up.

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.257 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And just some like sketch
comedian friends that we have.

00:14:51.257 --> 00:14:52.758
- Safe bet.

00:14:52.758 --> 00:14:55.361
(upbeat music)
