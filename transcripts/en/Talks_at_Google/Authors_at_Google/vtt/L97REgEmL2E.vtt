EMMA DONOGHUE:
Thank you very much.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.530
It's a thrill to be here.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.091
Your smoothies are
fantastic I'm going

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:09.340
to read just a couple of
pages from this, because what

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.190
I really love is answering
questions and chatting,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.934
so I don't want
to read too long.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:15.850
But on the other hand,
I love giving readings,

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.640
so I couldn't quite
do without that.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.080
I wrote "Frog Music"
because about 15 years ago I

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.976
came across a particular
unsolved murder.

00:00:23.976 --> 00:00:26.100
And there's a lot of unsolved
murders in the world,

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.600
you can't worry
about them too much,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.300
but this particular one
was about 27 year old

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.100
frog catcher you made her living
collecting sacks of live frogs

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.320
and delivering them to
San Francisco's Chinese

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.770
and French restaurants.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.960
And to do this
she wore trousers,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.900
and that means she got
arrested roughly once

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.520
a month under San
Francisco's little

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.380
known anti cross-dressing laws.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.859
So she's the kind
of character who,

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.150
if you dropped her on the
streets of San Francisco now,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.540
she wouldn't turn a--
nobody would bat an eyelid.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.620
That's the metaphor
I'm looking for.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.690
But in 1876, her
attitude towards gender,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.540
her playful, individualistic, do
your own thing kind of attitude

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.860
was unprecedented.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.550
She never disguised
herself as a man,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.500
she just swaggered around town
in her pants and her pistol,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.545
which in fact she'd taken out
on a kind of hired purchase

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.580
from a pawn broker.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.710
It didn't even belong to her.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.770
And somebody shot her
through a window at 27.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.710
And the other woman in the
room who emerged unscathed

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.830
was this French erotic
dancer called Blanche Beunon

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.080
I'm going to read you a
little scene where Blanche

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:40.576
is she's performing on stage at
the house of mirrors bordello.

00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:42.490
Here we go.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.040
"Blanche goes to stand
outside the stage door,

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.270
recognizing the final thumps
of Fabienne's flamenco

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.270
skipping rope act.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.430
The piano has been tuned,
which is some relief to her.

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.710
Blanche goes over her
routines in her head,

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.200
trying to block out the
sound of Madame's hushed,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.510
thrilling voice as
she warms the crowd up

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:03.470
for the enigmatic
Blanche le Danseuse.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.780
Blanche opens the stage
door a crack to check

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.690
whether the lights have gone
low, and she waits for silence.

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.509
The excited battle
of the audience

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.850
dies away in the near dark.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.500
Blanche walks out
onto the stage,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.950
as formal as some courtier,
and a storm of applause

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.170
rises when the lights flare up.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.810
Blanche averts
her face from them

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.760
until the cheering subsides.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.000
She makes a rapid scan
of the whole room.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.150
Not a single red
velvet chair is empty.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.280
The tune is a nervous
tarantella, slow at first,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.530
and then it starts to
hurry, and Blanche twitches.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.810
This one's a simple routine,
no intricate steps to remember

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.562
or fleets of
flexibility to perform.

00:02:41.562 --> 00:02:43.270
Blanche simply pretends
there's something

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.620
in her clothes, flea, spider,
skeeter, bee, wasp, it really

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.540
doesn't matter as long as she
imagines it vividly enough.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.900
And the music is half
the trick of this one.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.070
Stop and start,
itchily agitated,

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.660
then more, and more maddened
as the invisible parasite

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.380
starts to bite.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.560
Madame has always advertised
Blanche the lively flea

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.320
as having the speciality
of the tarantella

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.640
straight from gay
Paris, and in June

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.660
when some girl over
on California street

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.950
started doing the dance, Madame
sent a bouncer over to put paid

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.820
to that.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.200
But the fact is, Blanche
picked the gist of this act

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.830
up from another show girl
who spent only a few weeks

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.640
at the house of mirrors
before heading off to Chicago.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.480
The only difference is
that Blanche plays it

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.340
for earnest, not for laughs.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.160
Tonight, what she
pictures up her skirts

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.280
is one of those vicious
mosquitoes from San Miguel

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.700
station.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.420
So she flinches, twists,
spins around on herself.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.760
Her fingers pursue the
invisible invader up her gloves,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.830
down her neck, under
her sweeping black hem.

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.370
Every customer in
the house must be

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:44.870
able to imagine
where the bug has

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.640
got to, every fold and crevice.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.740
The tarantella is driving
Blanche out of her mind now,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.150
and she's peeling her gloves
off and flinging them away

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.140
towards the audience.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.570
Her own hands molesting
her, plunging up her skirt,

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.620
raking her thighs,
clawing at her skin

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.415
as if she wants to shed it.

00:04:01.415 --> 00:04:03.540
She's not even wearing
flesh colored tights tonight

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.550
because she has
broken with protocol,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.970
and her pale flawless
legs are bare,

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.940
and her eyes are terrified.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.910
She wrenches off the
little bolero jacket,

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.510
hearing a seam rip.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.470
She fights her hair in it's
[INAUDIBLE] till it falls down.

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.060
She tears the black satin
bodice open down the middle,

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.990
and fake pearls explode onto
the boards of the little stage.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.190
Some of the men in the
audience look more alarmed

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.725
than aroused, it
occurs to Blanch,

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.610
but does she give
a good goddamn?

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.890
She goes into one
last fit of frenzy

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.350
and collapses in the
middle of the stage.

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.940
Woo hoo!

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.330
Men are throwing up their
hats and catching them,

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.950
roaring Blanche,
Blanche, Blanche!

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.492
She waits for the
clamor to die away.

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:47.450
Do they like her like this,
laid low, hair in her eyes,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.680
coal halfway down
her cheeks, kneeling

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.620
in a plain corset and drawers
like any destroyed woman.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.740
The professor's eyes at the
piano are as neutral as ever.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.740
He gives Blanche that private
nod that means, ready?

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.100
And then he launches into
the simple, jolly chords

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.910
of her last number.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:08.300
Rage, Blanche recognizes
the feeling of last.

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.450
Rage, and deep down revulsion,
at the prospect of spending

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.370
another night of her life
turning this old crank.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.630
She summons her
forces and stands,

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.150
hand on her hip like some
slap dash street walker.

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.010
I wish I was the diamond--
she begins sweetly.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.930
I wish I was a diamond
upon my Lulu's hand,

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.070
and every time I
wiped my ass, I'd

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.520
see the promised land, oh lordy.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.250
Her gestures are broad, clownish
now, and the men love it.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.050
For the chorus, she
throws out her arms,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.680
conducting the audience
like an orchestra.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.060
Bang away Lulu, bang
anyway good and strong.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.160
Oh what'll we do for
a damn good screw

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.210
when our Lulu's dead and gone."

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.856
I'll leave that there.

00:05:50.856 --> 00:05:53.854
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:56.020
EMMA DONOGHUE: One of the
hardest things to research

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.020
for this book was to find out
what exactly erotic dancers did

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.880
in the 1870s.

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.640
You might think it's pretty
obvious what erotic dancers do,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.490
but no, they did not strip.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.590
They didn't take off
their clothes bit by bit.

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.890
They did not pole dance.

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:09.620
Nobody had invented
the poll dance.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.740
So it was very hard to
find out what they did.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.180
There's a lot of vague
stuff about mysterious women

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.780
of eroticism in
previous centuries,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.810
but it was very hard
to find specifics.

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:21.110
And two of the only
specifics I did

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.090
find where this Tarantella
thing, this bug up the skirt

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.870
dance that seems the oldest
form of erotic dance known.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.320
I mean, maybe the fact that
they were all flea infested,

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.200
they just decided to
make a virtue of that.

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.283
EMMA DONOGHUE: I cannot imagine
thrilling an audience nowadays

00:06:35.283 --> 00:06:37.390
by pretending that
you're infested.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.254
We just have
different standards.

00:06:39.254 --> 00:06:40.670
And another kind
of dance they did

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:42.250
a lot was the skirt
dance where they

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:45.960
would have this huge
skirt, 44 feet around,

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:49.950
and they would hide in the
skirt, make a butterfly of it,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.660
make a screen of it, and then
at the end they would undo

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.590
the skirt and have it
swoop over the audience.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.416
I decided that I didn't know
whether these dancers sang,

00:06:59.416 --> 00:07:00.790
but there were so
many good songs

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.750
around that I decided we have
to include some songs in it.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:08.110
I had to find out of copyright
texts for all the songs, which

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.140
proved very difficult.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:11.907
Because often, some lyrics
just float around online.

00:07:11.907 --> 00:07:13.990
And everyone says, oh yeah,
here's an old version.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:15.864
And you're thinking,
how old is that version.

00:07:15.864 --> 00:07:16.860
I need specifics.

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:19.730
There's a great folk
music site, called Mudcat,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.510
where all these really geeky
guys share their knowledge.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.260
And they're like,
that's the 1921 version,

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:25.790
you're mistaking
it for the 1922.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:29.860
EMMA DONOGHUE:
It's just fantastic

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.160
getting to suck the brains
from geeky guys online.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.910
They're just so happy to
share their knowledge.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.730
So I found really early
versions for most of the songs,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.770
but that Lulu song was almost
impossible to track down

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.340
because it was a dirty song.

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.070
And some of the later
versus are far worse.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:48.775
And because it was rude,
before the 20th century

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:49.900
nobody would write it down.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.774
They'd say things like,
and of course, we all

00:07:51.774 --> 00:07:53.300
know the notorious Lulu song.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.880
And I'd say, no we don't.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.460
Give me details.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:59.040
And then finally,
in the 1960s, bless

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:01.550
him, one particular editor
of a book of dirty songs,

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.327
he not only published
the text, but he

00:08:03.327 --> 00:08:05.660
said at the start-- I always
imagined he was smoking pot

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:08.420
at the time-- this
book copyright free,

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.410
share the songs.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.150
And then I noticed in the second
edition his publisher was like,

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:15.290
all applications must be
sent in writing to us.

00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:18.090
This book is copyright-- I had
a copy of the first edition

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.720
with this lovely
hallucinogenic cover.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:25.097
I finally got a copyright-free
version of Lulu.

00:08:25.097 --> 00:08:26.930
There are also many sad
things in this book.

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:30.330
It's not all fun
and games obviously.

00:08:30.330 --> 00:08:32.690
San Francisco was having
a particularly hard summer

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.498
in 1876.

00:08:33.498 --> 00:08:35.039
I didn't need to
make any of this up.

00:08:35.039 --> 00:08:37.360
It was having a record
heat wave, which is unusual

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.770
for San Francisco.

00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:41.490
Ice would fall off
carts in the street

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.630
and children would surround
it and lick the blocks.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:47.440
And they were simultaneously
having a smallpox epidemic,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.650
which usually was
a winter thing.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.220
So they were just
having a cursed season.

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:54.710
And, as you can probably
tell, I absolutely

00:08:54.710 --> 00:08:58.020
loved immersing myself in
this strange, and sticky,

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.070
and unhygienic world.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:02.200
Questions please.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.236
Questions about anything.

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:08.230
AUDIENCE: Well,
I will start off.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:11.780
I wanted to know, when you
were in your college career,

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:13.570
and then graduate
career, did you

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.445
think that you were
going to be an historian,

00:09:15.445 --> 00:09:19.100
or did you know that you were
going to be a writer, as well,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.050
of literary stuff.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.307
And did you plan to
merge those two things?

00:09:22.307 --> 00:09:23.140
EMMA DONOGHUE: Sure.

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:25.265
I thought I was going to
be a professor of English.

00:09:25.265 --> 00:09:27.040
My dad, Dennis Donoghue,
who taught at NYU

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.044
until last year, he's
a professor of English,

00:09:29.044 --> 00:09:30.710
and I thought I was
going to be one too.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.168
I now realize that would have
been a doomed plan, because I

00:09:33.168 --> 00:09:35.550
would've been the less
famous professor of English.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:37.550
You should really try not
to follow your parents

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.787
into any line of work.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:41.120
But I thought that's what I
would do, because I thought,

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.953
well, at least then I
can read books all day

00:09:42.953 --> 00:09:44.300
and write books at night.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.716
I think in fact,
I would have been

00:09:45.716 --> 00:09:47.425
a very discontented
professor of English.

00:09:47.425 --> 00:09:49.840
And you know the better kind
is always saying to students,

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:51.720
well I did an hour
of office hours,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.086
but now I'm writing my novel.

00:09:54.086 --> 00:09:56.460
I didn't think I would be a
historian because, growing up

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.510
in Ireland, I
thought history was

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.340
the tale of the many pathetic
little revolutions we had.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.300
Every few years we'd rise up and
the English would gun us down.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.100
And I just thought
that's what history was.

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.000
I hadn't quite clicked that
social history is history too.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.970
But anyway, then
I started writing

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.597
novels when I was about 20
during my undergrad degree.

00:10:15.597 --> 00:10:17.096
And my mother was
like, couldn't you

00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:18.835
get your exam first
and then your novels?

00:10:18.835 --> 00:10:23.120
And I was like, no, can't
wait, inspiration is knocking.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.980
And I managed to sell two
novels when I was about 23,

00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:28.820
and then I thought, maybe I
could just not have a job.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:29.980
I could just write.

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:31.140
How cool would that be?

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.185
And somehow, at 44, it has
worked, so far at least.

00:10:35.185 --> 00:10:38.054
And yeah, so I've never had,
not just a nine to five job,

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:39.470
but any kind of
job where you have

00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:42.740
to turn up and do what
anybody else tells you to.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:43.240
Never.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.130
Somehow got away without it.

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:47.430
Which means that when I'm
writing contemporary fiction,

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:50.330
I have difficulty describing
real jobs for my character.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.582
So I have to say to
friends, what's it like?

00:10:52.582 --> 00:10:54.540
What time do you have to
get up in the morning?

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.820
You have to shower every day?

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.230
[LAUGHTER] But you
probably don't have to

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:01.320
at Google, do you?

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.410
So yeah.

00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:05.970
In a way, I'm an
academic gone wrong.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.060
And I think my academic
training has left me

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:12.379
with not only a profound
interest in research,

00:11:12.379 --> 00:11:13.420
and getting things right.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.520
I absolutely love
the forensic task

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.950
of making a book
like "Frog Music"

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.140
true as much as I can make
it, as well as fiction.

00:11:22.140 --> 00:11:25.400
You've got these two
loyalties, these two jobs.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.210
I would say there are about 26
characters in "Frog Music" who

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:30.930
are real people from the time.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:32.620
Often all I know
is one tiny thing,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.161
like one particular
French prostitute

00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:37.400
in the gold rush, Maria la
Forge, she got in a fight

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:39.025
with her pimp and he
threw acid at her,

00:11:39.025 --> 00:11:40.882
which was the crime of the day.

00:11:40.882 --> 00:11:42.340
That was very common
in those days.

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:43.517
She had half a face.

00:11:43.517 --> 00:11:44.975
I just thought,
she's irresistible,

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.120
I have to include her as an
older woman in my novel set

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:50.150
20 years later
wandering around San

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:52.390
Francisco with
this mangled face.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.620
I'm not suggesting that
I'm able to completely

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.782
conjure these people up as
they were, but give them

00:11:58.782 --> 00:12:00.490
at least a moment in
the spotlight again.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.060
I always assume
they're grateful,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.280
because otherwise they would
be completely forgotten.

00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:06.370
Whereas if you're writing
about really famous people

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.080
from the past, you might
feel that they're like,

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:08.850
don't bug me.

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:10.750
Don't dig me up again.

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.000
But the kind of obscure
nobody's and oddities

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.480
that I write about,
I always assume

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.755
they're grateful for
a little attention.

00:12:15.755 --> 00:12:16.582
You know?

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.848
AUDIENCE: So how do
you write? [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:22.848 --> 00:12:25.150
Given that you don't
have to get up at 6:30

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.230
and get on the train.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.900
What do you actually do?

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:27.290
EMMA DONOGHUE:
Well, a great thing

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.180
that structures the
day is children.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.770
So, I used to be able
to write any old time,

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.350
so sometimes I'd find it
a bit hard to get started.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.959
But now, when my kids are
deposited on the school bus,

00:12:37.959 --> 00:12:39.500
I just feel this
surge of adrenaline.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.460
They're gone, I can write.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:45.330
And so I run to my desk, and
these days I run at my desk

00:12:45.330 --> 00:12:47.330
as well because I use a
treadmill for about half

00:12:47.330 --> 00:12:48.090
the day.

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:50.770
And again, it'll be not
that exciting to you,

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.740
but in the writing
world it's fairly freaky

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.064
still to use a treadmill.

00:12:54.064 --> 00:12:54.910
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we have a few
of those around the building.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:55.280
EMMA DONOGHUE: Yeah.

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:55.960
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.220
EMMA DONOGHUE: Fantastic.

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:57.410
You see, I hate exercise.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.040
So the idea that I can be
exercising without knowing it

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.864
while I'm writing is fantastic.

00:13:02.864 --> 00:13:04.780
For the first year I was
getting static shocks

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:07.029
because nobody had told me
about antistatic bracelets.

00:13:07.029 --> 00:13:08.560
I should have asked earlier.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.310
I just thought it was
part of the process.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.996
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:11.996 --> 00:13:13.120
EMMA DONOGHUE: And so yeah.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.370
So I would say the day
alternates between sitting down

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:18.210
writing, standing up writing.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.370
And I do a huge
amount of planning.

00:13:20.370 --> 00:13:23.650
I use a really good Apple
program, a program for Mac

00:13:23.650 --> 00:13:25.160
called Scrivener.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:27.110
I used to use Word, and
so I'd write my novel

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:28.740
in one huge, long Word file.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.240
And then I'd go, where is
the bit about the dog, search

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.870
for the dog, cut
and paste sections,

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:37.020
occasionally forgot to
paste a section and lose it.

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:39.090
I know this sounds
silly, but Scrivener

00:13:39.090 --> 00:13:42.600
lets you write in lots of
tiny, little postcard chunks

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.732
and then move them around.

00:13:43.732 --> 00:13:45.190
So, for instance,
I started writing

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:47.590
this book in chronological
order from when

00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:50.130
Blanche and Jenny, and all their
friends meet in the summer,

00:13:50.130 --> 00:13:52.400
through to Jenny's
murder and the aftermath.

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.150
I'm not giving too
much away because Jenny

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:55.960
get's killed in the first page.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.790
And so I was writing it that
way, and then I thought,

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:00.290
you know, it feels
too undramatic

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.980
just starting with
them making friends.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:04.340
I want to start with
blood on the floor,

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:05.850
and then cut back and forward.

00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:08.700
And so I was able to just
move all the scenes around

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.200
like a puzzle pieces.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.680
So I'm a big planner,
and sometimes

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:15.150
when I'm describing this to
audiences of book lovers,

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.820
they look at me like,
how coldblooded you are.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.060
But to me, it's like you
wouldn't try and plan

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.717
a building without blueprints.

00:14:22.717 --> 00:14:24.800
You wouldn't just say, oh,
let's just get creative

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.661
and build it from the ground
up, because it would fall down.

00:14:27.661 --> 00:14:29.160
And some of my books
would fall down

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.534
if I didn't do a
lot of planning.

00:14:30.534 --> 00:14:32.820
And in particular I'm
not very good at plots.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:34.950
I can do dialogue till
the cows come home.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:36.450
I'm sort of natural
with characters,

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:39.650
but plotting, and in particular
suspenseful plotting,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.070
doesn't come naturally to me.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:42.790
So I do a lot of
planning, because if I

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.260
have got a chart of what happens
in each chapter and each scene,

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.992
then I can easily see that
it's a big problem when nothing

00:14:48.992 --> 00:14:50.950
happens in chapter three,
nothing real happens.

00:14:50.950 --> 00:14:53.170
There are no revelations,
no major changes.

00:14:53.170 --> 00:14:55.340
And I say to myself, let's
not have a chapter three,

00:14:55.340 --> 00:14:56.290
let's just cut it.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.260
So that kind of planning,
I think for the last

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.780
maybe about four
books, has really

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.360
helped me tighten
the narrative thread.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.760
Whereas I think
some writers just

00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.530
do that at an unconscious level.

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:08.130
The writers who say that
they just sit down and start

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.690
on page one, and they don't
know where they're going,

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:11.106
I think in the
back of their minds

00:15:11.106 --> 00:15:13.490
they must somehow know
where they're going.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.010
But I need an actual blueprint.

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.830
And of course, you can still
change things as you go along.

00:15:18.830 --> 00:15:20.020
Just because you've
committed yourself

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.070
to the bar fight in chapter
six, it doesn't mean,

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:24.721
when you get there, you can't
have a love scene instead.

00:15:24.721 --> 00:15:26.720
AUDIENCE: Do you do all
the research first then?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.580
EMMA DONOGHUE: I do a lot
first but then-- Of course, I

00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.680
don't use most of it.

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.970
So I'm just looking for that
one bizarre little detail.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:36.506
And so it's not like
researching for-- If you're

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:37.880
writing an article
about a place,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.046
you feel obliged to tell
people all about the place.

00:15:40.046 --> 00:15:43.230
I'm more like, what's the
one, little, odd thing?

00:15:43.230 --> 00:15:46.130
So I do a lot beforehand,
then I start to story plan.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.360
For instance, one of
the newspaper articles

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.940
I found about
Jenny had mentioned

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.660
that when the press had caught
up with Blanche's boyfriend

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.720
Arthur, he had a couple
of poxs on his face

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.250
from a recent
outbreak of smallpox.

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:58.195
And I thought, oh, did
they have that at the time.

00:15:58.195 --> 00:16:00.445
So next thing I knew, I was
planning an entire chapter

00:16:00.445 --> 00:16:02.570
in which Arther nearly
dies of smallpox.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:05.720
So the story sort of arises
naturally out of the research.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.620
So then I start
drafting it, and I

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.700
have to stop constantly to do
more research as I go along.

00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.760
And on the research
involved a lot of pictures

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:16.220
this time, a lot of photographs
of San Francisco, architecture

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:20.060
that just all crumbled away
in the earthquake in 1906.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.010
Lots of, say, promotional
postcards of burlesque dancers.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:26.810
Because nobody was keeping
detailed accounts of what they

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:30.820
did, so you have to deduce
it from their crazy costumes.

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:34.250
You know, girls wearing horses
heads, and bows and arrows,

00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:37.437
and breast plates, and ofter
quite playful military stuff.

00:16:37.437 --> 00:16:39.145
They'd have a jacket
with frogging on it,

00:16:39.145 --> 00:16:42.140
and military stripes,
and then no skirt.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.690
So you had to deduce a
lot from the pictures.

00:16:45.690 --> 00:16:48.530
So some of the amazing
photographs of Eadweard

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:52.520
Muybridge, he'd had some
almost stop motion one's he

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:53.870
would take.

00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:55.860
He'd rig up a string
and take 20 pictures

00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:58.360
over three seconds of,
either a horse most famously,

00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.770
or of a woman carrying
a towel or something.

00:17:02.770 --> 00:17:04.130
So yeah, I love the research.

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.984
I don't find that
it gets in the way.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:09.569
So long as you ruthlessly drop
anything that doesn't fit.

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:11.403
I really don't
like any paragraph

00:17:11.403 --> 00:17:13.069
in a book that sounds
like the author is

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:15.200
stopping to educate you.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.440
So if my point of view
character wouldn't

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.240
care what political party
has won the election,

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:21.240
then I don't mention it.

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:31.336
AUDIENCE: Anyone else have
a few questions or comments?

00:17:31.336 --> 00:17:33.280
Come on.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.710
Googlers are not this shy.

00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.120
AUDIENCE: So with
"Room," which, I'm sure

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.380
you've gotten this question
before, you have children

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:45.689
so-- although I have children,
I wouldn't be able to do it--

00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:49.858
but I'm assuming that helped
in the five year old's voice.

00:17:49.858 --> 00:17:54.384
I thought what was interesting
was not so much the lack self

00:17:54.384 --> 00:17:56.634
pity, because he had no idea
why he would pity himself

00:17:56.634 --> 00:17:59.986
through the whole thing, but
it's after they were escaped,

00:17:59.986 --> 00:18:03.215
and for him this new freedom
wasn't really freedom.

00:18:03.215 --> 00:18:07.190
How were you-- the adult
and child situations

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:11.621
were flipped in the
real world, so to speak.

00:18:11.621 --> 00:18:13.466
I don't have a question.

00:18:13.466 --> 00:18:13.966
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.966 --> 00:18:15.607
AUDIENCE: Talk about that.

00:18:15.607 --> 00:18:16.190
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:16.190 --> 00:18:17.310
Talk about it.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.420
EMMA DONOGHUE: In a way,
what anchored "Room," writing

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:23.300
about such a weird,
one off situation,

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.250
is that I kept trying
to think of every day,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.920
normal experiences we've
all had which are like that.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:31.380
Because Jack goes from
being in a new born

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:35.200
situation, in that he's never
more than a few feet away

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.880
from his mother.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:37.420
She's eternally
available to him.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.560
He's still breastfeeding,
so he's like a newborn.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.499
And then he goes through to
being more like a seven year.

00:18:42.499 --> 00:18:44.790
Having to spend lots of time
away from his mother even.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:49.360
So I kept thinking of what's an
everyday situation like that?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.330
The first time you drop
a kid off at playschool

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:54.650
and you're thinking the
child will be sobbing

00:18:54.650 --> 00:18:56.930
and the child walks away
without looking back.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.160
And you think, where's
that intense bond gone.

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:01.373
He just used me.

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:01.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.872 --> 00:19:04.580
EMMA DONOGHUE: So every
parent has got those moments.

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:06.162
Or when you're
playing with a child,

00:19:06.162 --> 00:19:07.620
and you're giving
it all you've got

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:10.119
and you think, I'm so magical,
and then they say, I'm bored.

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:12.840
Could we do something else?

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.130
Those moments of reversal.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.250
Or I remember one
moment with my daughter

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:19.373
where I briefly
lost her on a cliff.

00:19:19.373 --> 00:19:22.440
We were at a monument to
[INAUDIBLE] in France,

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:25.164
and it was this amazing glass
tube heading towards the sea.

00:19:25.164 --> 00:19:27.330
So I was having my moment
thinking about [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.000
and then I can't find
my three year old.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.680
And I just completely panicked,
and then I spun around,

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.600
and there she was, She
saw I was all shaky

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.350
and she was like, it's OK.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:37.500
I'm right here, it's OK.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:38.958
And I thought,
she's comforting me.

00:19:38.958 --> 00:19:41.760
This is just a bizarre reversal.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.654
And similarly, I
find as adults we

00:19:43.654 --> 00:19:45.820
have to explain the rules
of our society to children

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.945
all the time, because in
a way, they're always new.

00:19:47.945 --> 00:19:50.160
The first time you have
to explain to a child

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.410
that things like in
a big supermarket

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:57.590
you can collect everything
and only pay at the end,

00:19:57.590 --> 00:20:00.479
but in a shopping mall, even
though there's no actual door,

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:02.270
as soon as you step
out of one little space

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:03.978
and into the corridor
you're shoplifting.

00:20:03.978 --> 00:20:06.240
So you have to
remember to pay first.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.340
That rule was actually
explained in the hand book

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.900
for new Canadians that I was
given when I moved to Canada.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.400
They're clearly
assuming that you're

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.566
coming from some very other
culture where they don't

00:20:14.566 --> 00:20:17.157
do shopping malls, and so they
spell all these rules out.

00:20:17.157 --> 00:20:19.490
And I remember thinking that
a child wouldn't know that,

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.560
so a child would
accidentally shoplift.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.510
A child would hug,
rush towards a dog

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.320
and get their hand
bitten as my son did.

00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:29.590
And a child would hug somebody
who they're not meant to.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:32.014
And so I just thought
Jack is just like that,

00:20:32.014 --> 00:20:33.930
but he's having to learn
the rules all at once

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:37.712
instead of gradually
over a number of years.

00:20:37.712 --> 00:20:39.560
But it was a very
interesting exercise.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.580
It was a defamiliarization
effect on my entire life.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:44.122
Everything I looked
at, I'd say, wow,

00:20:44.122 --> 00:20:45.913
if you'd been living
in a locked room, that

00:20:45.913 --> 00:20:47.160
would look very different.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:49.010
And a lot of it,
a lot of our world

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.370
seemed incredibly stressful
from Jack's perspective.

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.880
And I put myself in the
book as a bad Starbucks mom.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.460
I have Jack brought
to Starbucks,

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.090
and there's moments where he's
noticing some mother who's

00:21:00.090 --> 00:21:02.110
fobbing her child off
with a giant cookie

00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:06.340
so she can talk to her friends
and check her messages.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:08.900
I thought, that's
me the part mother

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.950
saying leave me alone
so I can write my scene.

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:13.039
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:15.580
EMMA DONOGHUE: That book made
me feel like such a bad mother.

00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:17.850
But luckily, in
this book, Blanche

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:19.569
has a baby she's
very neglectful of,

00:21:19.569 --> 00:21:21.610
and I felt like a great
mother compared with her.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:23.394
So this one was
a real refresher.

00:21:23.394 --> 00:21:24.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.580
EMMA DONOGHUE: You know,
by 1870s standards,

00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.680
I'm supreme as a mother.

00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:34.254
AUDIENCE: So where did the
idea for "Room" come from.

00:21:34.254 --> 00:21:36.920
EMMA DONOGHUE: It happened to be
the Fritzl case in Austria that

00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:38.360
inspired it, but I
remember thinking, OK, I

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.890
don't want anyone thinking I'm
writing about a real victim

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:42.331
here, that would be tacky.

00:21:42.331 --> 00:21:44.330
Because when you write
about people in the past,

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:44.860
that's fine.

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.080
They're never going
to knock on your door.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.300
But writing about
real people now,

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.690
that would give me the creeps.

00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:50.720
So I thought, I'll
set it in America,

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:52.400
very far away from Austria.

00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.620
In the Fritzl case in
Austria, she and her children

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:56.912
were in an underground dungeon.

00:21:56.912 --> 00:21:58.744
And I thought, OK, I'll
make it above ground

00:21:58.744 --> 00:21:59.906
in a shed with a sky light.

00:21:59.906 --> 00:22:01.030
It'll be totally different.

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.779
And then right after
I'd written the book,

00:22:02.779 --> 00:22:05.130
Jaycee Dugard was discovered
in a shed in California.

00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:07.270
And I thought, you
just can't win.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.880
And then the Cleveland
case happened,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.700
and I had people
blogging saying,

00:22:11.700 --> 00:22:13.230
Emma Donoghue must
feel so guilty

00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:16.604
that she's inspired this crime.

00:22:16.604 --> 00:22:18.890
And I thought, don't tell
me that those monsters read

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:19.930
literary fiction.

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:21.270
I just don't believe it.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:25.010
I mean, copycats all of
other crimes to copy from.

00:22:25.010 --> 00:22:28.734
They don't need to
read novels to do it.

00:22:28.734 --> 00:22:31.150
It's funny, you get so used
to a particular subject you're

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:35.270
researching like
smallpox, or infanticide,

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:38.130
that you learn to be able to
talk about it quite flippantly,

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.505
and then you suddenly think,
I've just said the word rape

00:22:40.505 --> 00:22:41.990
and I'm giggling.

00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:46.293
It's awful how you get used
to whatever your topic is.

00:22:46.293 --> 00:22:47.959
AUDIENCE: What's
coming up next for you.

00:22:47.959 --> 00:22:49.125
What are you working on now?

00:22:49.125 --> 00:22:51.036
Well you see, with
"Frog Music" I

00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.160
set myself the challenge
of making it a real murder

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:54.701
mystery, as well as
a literary novel.

00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:57.040
I thought the mystery
side of it has to work,

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.340
because people who like
crime, they read it a lot,

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.340
and they're very sophisticated
readers of crime,

00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:03.900
and they do not want you to
make some pathetic, halfhearted

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:04.710
attempt at crime.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.189
It's got to work.

00:23:06.189 --> 00:23:08.230
And there's a kind of a
contract with the reader.

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.160
And similarly, I
found it so enjoyable

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.990
to have that particular kind of
gun to my head, at every point

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:16.030
I was like, will the crime
fans be happy enough?

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:19.151
Will they accept it
as a crime novel?

00:23:19.151 --> 00:23:20.900
Now I'm trying to write
a children's book,

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:24.180
and that's way scarier,
because a lot of writers

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.730
think, oh, I've
written for adults.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:27.990
I can write for children.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.823
Or, oh, I'm a mom, I
can write for children.

00:23:29.823 --> 00:23:31.650
But I don't assume that
any of these things

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:34.130
give me the ability
to write for children.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:37.210
And so, in another month I
have to submit the first draft

00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:38.675
to my son and his
two best friends.

00:23:38.675 --> 00:23:39.175
[LAUGHTER}

00:23:39.175 --> 00:23:40.490
EMMA DONOGHUE: I'm terrified.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:43.760
So I've written up a
reader's report for them

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.160
to fill in for me.

00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:47.034
I'm trying to give
them questions

00:23:47.034 --> 00:23:48.200
that won't hurt my feelings.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.010
So I don't at any point
say, do you like this book?

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.770
I say things like,
which character did you

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:53.900
find most interesting?

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:58.040
But of course, they could still
subvert this by going, none.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.375
Because kids just have no tack.

00:24:00.375 --> 00:24:03.090
So I'm nervous about that,
but on the other hand

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.480
I'm planning a five book series.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:07.017
So I'm very
confident in one way.

00:24:07.017 --> 00:24:08.600
Or rather, with every
book, I've found

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.450
that if you just, from
the very beginning,

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.270
assume it will be published in a
lovely cover and given a title,

00:24:13.270 --> 00:24:16.150
and even write those
blurbs on the jacket.

00:24:16.150 --> 00:24:18.560
I write them very early
on before the book.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:19.540
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.530
EMMA DONOGHUE: It's like, if I
fake it, somebody will make it,

00:24:21.530 --> 00:24:22.130
you know.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:24.970
I'll call it a room, and I'll
even talk about it in public

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:27.120
to Googlers, and
therefore it will happen.

00:24:30.295 --> 00:24:32.170
AUDIENCE: So, does
anybody else have anything

00:24:32.170 --> 00:24:35.040
they would like to add
or ask or anything?

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.270
We do have McNally
Jackson in the back

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:39.920
with us-- yay-- to have
copies of both "Frog

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.260
Music" and "Room."

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.692
These are the
subsidized editions

00:24:42.692 --> 00:24:45.290
that you can get for $10 cash.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:48.699
And maybe Emma will sit
for a few more minutes

00:24:48.699 --> 00:24:49.990
and sign copies of them for us.

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.540
EMMA DONOGHUE: Sure.

00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.605
AUDIENCE: So, if anybody
else-- Unless there's

00:24:53.605 --> 00:24:55.244
anything else to
ask, let's just hang

00:24:55.244 --> 00:24:56.660
out and chat for
a couple minutes.

00:24:56.660 --> 00:24:57.260
Thank you Emma.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:58.301
EMMA DONOGHUE: Thank you.

00:24:58.301 --> 00:24:59.710
That was fun.
