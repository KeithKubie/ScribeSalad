NICOLAS GARNIER: Hello, hello
everybody, and welcome to

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.070
"What's New with the Google
Drive SDK: One Year Later." My

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.800
name is Nicolas.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.030
I'm a developer advocate.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.059
I've been working on Google
Drive pretty much since we

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.000
launched Google Drive
about a year ago.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.120
During this session we're going
to have a look at what

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.090
happened to the Google Drive
SDK since we launched it,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.946
basically, up until today.

00:00:28.946 --> 00:00:32.369
As I said, we launched Google
Drive about a year ago.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.610
And when we launched Google
Drive, we had

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.120
several goals in mind.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.650
So of course one of the goals
was to offer to our users a

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.750
way to back up all of the
files that are in their

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.320
desktop and upload it online
and share their files with

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.300
their friends, for example.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.600
So that's pretty much what
people expected from a service

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.500
like Google Drive.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.350
But that was actually
not the main goal.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.260
The main goal was really to
make Google Drive a pretty

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.760
central place on the
web platform.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.010
And we'll see that
in just a second.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.230
You guys all know now
that the web is

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.000
really a platform, right?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.480
You're all using web
apps, for instance.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.810
I know I have moved online for
a lot of my work needs.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.830
For example, I use Google
Sheet, Google Docs--

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.210
that's the old name--

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.970
Google Slides, pretty
much everyday now.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.160
And there's a lot more than
you can do online.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.720
You can find really nice
image editors online.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.720
I started using, for example,
a online development

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.940
environment lately.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.240
You can fax files online.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.640
You can actually listen
to music online.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.420
So my point is, there is now a
lot of very high quality web

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.030
apps that you can
find and use.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.570
And we see this trend where
people are really moving away

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.160
from the desktop and really
started doing more and more

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.930
things online.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.940
As people are really moving
online, they wanted to have a

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.140
place to basically keep all
of their files online.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.340
And that's why we launched
Google Drive.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:14.640
It's really to provide our users
a place to manage and

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.800
organize all of the
files online.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.810
But not only that, it's really
also a place for your favorite

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.670
web apps to be able to write
files on your Google Drive,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.830
have a place to write and
read files, basically.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.150
That's also why we built Google
Drive, is the case.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:42.010
It's really to basically
offer the web

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.530
platform a file system.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.680
So that that's really important
message here.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.410
Google Drive is really the file

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.130
system for the web platform.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.650
And the SDK, it's pretty much
the programmatic interface to

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:56.900
this file system.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.730
So we really wanted to make the
SDK a really easy to use,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.790
easy to integrate
user experience.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.960
So as you'll see, we wanted to
make it pretty much as easy to

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.470
integrate as a desktop
application would today

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.670
integrate with the local
file system.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.880
We actually didn't want
to stop there.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.350
We wanted to not only make it
as easy for web applications

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.730
to use this web file system that
Drive SDK is, but we also

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.410
wanted to use some of the
collaboration and security

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.190
features that are available on
the web today to make it

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.280
basically more powerful and more
secure that if your app

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.530
was not on the cloud.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.930
When we launched Google Drive,
of course, what was available

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.470
is a programmatic way to access
and manage files.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.730
That's really the API
part of our SDK.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.960
With the Google API, you can
basically do all of the things

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.730
that you would expect
from a file system.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:08.730
You can manage, read,
write file.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.560
You can delete files.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.040
You can create files
on Google Drive.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.400
All that is using a REST API.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.700
It's using also OAuth 2.0 for
our authorization mechanism.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.100
This is all pretty much expected
from the file system

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:29.000
from a data web API that
Google could provide.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.450
One thing that's pretty special,
though, is one of the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.500
security features that we
launched with Google

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.980
Drive a year ago.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.060
There's basically a way for
application to restrict

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.190
themselves to only gain access
to the files they have either

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.740
created or the files that the
user has manually opened

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.060
through the drive
user interface.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.670
We'll see how that's possible
in just a second.

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:55.560
And this is actually very, very

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.690
convenient for users, right?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.180
Because the application doesn't
gain access to the

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.610
entire Google Drive, at least
not programmatically.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.120
They're not restricted to only
a subfolder, like sometimes

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.720
it's done here.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.430
The user can potentially open
any of the files that is in

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.610
the user's drive with an app,
but without giving the access

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:22.110
to files that potentially you
wouldn't want to give access

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.390
to applications out there.

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.860
That brings us to the other very
important feature that

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.320
was launched with Google
Drive a year ago.

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.260
It's the ability for the
application to deeply

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.300
integrate with the user
interface, with the user

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.720
interface case of the
Drive file export.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.790
Basically, how it works is,
apps can register to

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:47.100
[? append ?] certain
file types.

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.210
For example, a user could go in
his drive and try to open

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.620
that vacation photo that you
see on the screen here with

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.100
PicMonkey or Pixlr Editor.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.860
If you don't know what PicMonkey
or Pixlr Editor is,

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.610
these are pretty powerful image
editors that are online,

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.140
that you can use online and
that have integrated with

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.860
Google Drive.

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:21.440
How it works is, the user is
going to connect his Google

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.990
Drive-enabled applications
to Google Drive.

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.180
And how he can do that, he can
basically go to his Drive and

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.940
directly browse all of the
applications that are Google

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:38.260
Drive compatible that
are available today.

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:41.880
He will simply go to his Create
Menu, click on Connect

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:45.410
More Apps, and he will be able
to browse and search all of

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.830
these Google Drive
compatible apps.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.120
There's apps like AutoCAD,
for example.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.250
There are music players.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.720
There are diagramming
applications, photo editors.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.700
There's a lot you can
do right now.

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.080
And we're going to have
a look at one of them,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:03.705
called Hello Fax.

00:07:03.705 --> 00:07:07.690
It allows you to do very
easily fax documents.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.610
And they've done a pretty good
job on their Google Drive

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:13.360
integration.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.580
So this is my drive.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.890
There's only a few documents.

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:20.110
And what I want to do is, I
want to fax that PDF here

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.090
that's on my screen.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.650
So how I'm going to do
that, is I'm going to

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.070
look for Hello Fax.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.110
I simply have to search the
kind of embedded app store

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:35.020
that's inside Google
Drive here.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.820
I'm going to connect
Hello Fax.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.990
And I get a confirmation
dialog.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.990
And then I can do as a user
is right-click, Open With,

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:45.390
select Hello Fax.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.330
Now Hello Fax is part of the
options to open that the type

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:49.970
of file, PDF.

00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.870
This is the first time I'm
running Hello Fax from Drive.

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.530
I get this OAuth 2.0
configuration dialog, just

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:02.780
basically granting Hello Fax
access to my Google Drive.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:04.140
Now I get redirected
to Hello Fax.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.390
Hello Fax has these
two features.

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:09.800
One is online signature
management feature.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.080
The other one is their faxing
feature, which I want to use.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.320
And as you can see here,
Hello Fax is

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.580
pulling my PDF, basically.

00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.470
It's a very simple,
very small PDF.

00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:21.690
It just says Hello.

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.530
And that's it.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.560
Hello Fax has my PDF.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.670
I can now use Hello Fax
to fax that PDF.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:29.300
I could enter any bogus
phone number.

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.480
It's going to go to
Austria somewhere.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.190
And that's it.

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:37.159
Hello Fax is actually trying
to send my PDF to

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:39.500
this number I entered.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.230
Hello Fax does a lot more
cool stuff with the

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.530
Google Drive API.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.980
For example, they will upload
a confirmation fax to your

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.860
Google Drive.

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.710
You can also purchase, for
example, phone numbers and

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.630
receive all of your faxes
through Hello Fax.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:58.010
They're going to write all of
those faxes you receive as PDF

00:08:58.010 --> 00:08:59.160
inside Google Drive directly.

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.110
So there's all pretty
nice features.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:09.510
When we launched Google Drive
there was 18 partners that

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:12.510
were offering this Deep
UI integration.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:18.530
And I think you're going to
find about 150 apps today

00:09:18.530 --> 00:09:21.920
connectable through
the Google Drive.

00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.370
There's of course a lot more
applications using the API on

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.660
Android, on iOS, and on the
web that are not as deeply

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.060
integrated as these 150 apps.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.260
So you can find a lot more.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:35.680
You can find a lot of
cool applications.

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:39.980
But there's also a lot of room
still left for you to

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.570
basically get noticed
inside Google Drive.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:45.430
So if you're interested in
learning more about this, I

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:49.110
invite you to attend Steven
and Josh's session.

00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:54.450
It's called "Getting Your App
Noticed Inside Google Drive."

00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:57.360
So they're going to talk about
how, of course, you can get

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.810
your app noticed inside Google
Drive, but also how Google

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:03.310
Drive can be an efficient way
to drive traffic or drive

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:05.470
users to your application.

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:09.420
That's at 10:00 AM tomorrow.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.450
We also wanted to allow you to
very easily integrate with

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:13.770
Google Drive.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:16.850
So we've built basically
a bunch of widgets.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.140
These widgets are common UI
components that you can

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:26.780
integrate very easily inside
your web apps, typically using

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:30.030
a few lines of JavaScript
or a few lines of HTML.

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:34.080
And the first widget that we
launched, actually, when we

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.690
launched the API that was
available a year ago, is the

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:37.400
Google Picker.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:43.110
So the Google Picker is really
a widget that allows your

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:47.910
users to basically browse their
file and select files

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.180
inside Google Drive.

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.920
That's basically the equivalent
of, if you were on

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.490
the desktop application,
starting a file explorer

00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:59.060
process to let your users
select a file.

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.100
We basically wanted to bring
the same easy integration

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.740
experience to web applications
online.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.450
The second widget that was
launched actually at Google

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:14.650
I/O last year, so a bit less
than a year ago, is the

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:15.520
Sharing Dialog.

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.270
So it's actually the same exact
sharing dialog that

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.790
you're going to find in web
properties like Google Docs,

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.430
Google Spreadsheets, or Google
Slides, actually even in

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:26.630
Google Drive.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:29.520
It's exactly the same UI, except
you're going to be able

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:33.270
to use it inside your website,
embedded inside your website,

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:38.580
and let user share files
directly from your website.

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:40.490
So if you think about it,
that's actually not

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:42.170
so trivial to build.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:46.070
We have a nice feature like
Autocomplete here.

00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:50.330
The widget is also going to look
at if your Google Apps

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:53.800
administrator has enabled public
sharing and display

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:55.540
that option or not.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.130
It's also going to send an email
to the people you've

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.600
shared the document with
when you confirm.

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.280
So all that is already built for
you and you can integrate

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.580
this very easily inside
your website.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:07.950
I think that's a few lines
of JavaScript.

00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:14.170
Also the last widget that we
launched-- that was actually

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.700
last week-- is the Safe
to Drive button.

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.480
So Safe to Drive button is
pretty simple, right?

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:25.590
It basically allows your users
to download the file directly

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:28.260
to Google Drive instead of
having to download it locally

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.170
and maybe re-upload it.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.230
That's all done in basically
one operation.

00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:36.440
And what's really nice about
that widget is that it's only

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.690
really two lines of HTML.

00:12:40.810 --> 00:12:41.730
I'm not kidding.

00:12:41.730 --> 00:12:43.510
You copy and paste those two
lines of HTML and it should

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.290
work pretty much for most of
the files you could think

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:52.020
about downloading from
your website.

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.560
I'm actually going to
show you some of

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.410
these widgets in action.

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:58.626
The first app I wanted to show
you is called Neutron Drive.

00:12:58.626 --> 00:13:02.360
Neutron Drive is a nice online
ID for Google Drive.

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.120
It's nice and integrated
with Google Drive.

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.990
Let me switch to
Neutron Drive.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.740
This is Neutron Drive.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.680
As you can see, I'm currently
editing an HTML file in there.

00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:17.330
And if I wanted to open a file
that's in my drive, I could

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:21.300
click this button here and
Neutron Drive just pulls up

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.260
the Google Picker, where
I could simply

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:24.790
open another file.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:29.230
What I could do also is, for
example, share that file,

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.280
right-click on the tab here
and select Sharing.

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.330
You can see that's the
embeddable sharing dialog

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:36.780
that's inside Neutron Drive.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.430
I could just share it with my
friends or my colleagues.

00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:48.070
Also the other widget was the
Safe to Drive button.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:51.480
O'Reilly was one of the launch
partners for that button, so

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.800
they had integrated the
button at launch.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.360
That was just a week ago.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.600
And as you can see here, that's
actually one of their

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.000
free e-books that you
can download.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.790
And they've added a bunch of
buttons, one for each of the

00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:07.840
file formats that you
can download.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.080
Here I'm simply going
to download the PDF.

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.650
You have to confirm.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:15.510
As you can see, the PDF
is downloading.

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.460
It's actually a pretty
big PDF.

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:21.380
Once it's done, you can
very simply open it

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.810
within Google Drive.

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:24.970
Let me just show you, since it
should take just a second.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.170
As you can see, the PDF
is now in my drive.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:37.080
And this is our PDF URL.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:38.330
All right.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.560
One of the features that we
launched that actually got

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.200
quite some attention was the
ability for users to basically

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.680
publish websites from
Google Drive.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.130
So this feature is actually
pretty simple to use.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.170
Basically, any folder that you
would make public in Google

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:05.610
Drive, the content of the folder
would become directly

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.190
accessible through a URL that
you can see here on the

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.470
screen, a special URL.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:15.860
And under that URL, basically,
all of the resources, all of

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.490
the files, all of the documents
that would be part

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:22.230
of that folder would be
accessible by path, basically,

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:28.460
just like if they were served
from a regular web server.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:32.860
Some people did quite some
interesting things with it.

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.970
Actually I'm going to go back
to Neutron Drive, who is

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:39.350
actually surfacing that
feature directly from

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.582
within their UI.

00:15:41.582 --> 00:15:45.990
So Neutron Drive has this
nice file explorer.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:48.115
It's basically showing all
the files that are

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:49.510
inside my drive here.

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:51.880
And one of the things you can do
is, you can right-click on

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.900
a folder and make it web
viewable, they call it.

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.660
So that basically makes
the folder public.

00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:00.930
Shared publicly.

00:16:00.930 --> 00:16:03.470
Once you've done that, you could
simply right-click on

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.250
any of the files that are inside
that folder, and click

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:07.110
View Files.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:11.120
And that's going to open, for
example, that HTML file I was

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.840
working on directly as if it was
served from a web server.

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.320
That's actually one other
presentation I am sometimes

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.610
giving about OAuth 2.0.

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.630
So as you can see, that's
HTML5 slides here.

00:16:25.630 --> 00:16:28.400
It uses a bunch of service
[INAUDIBLE]

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.310
images, et cetera.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:32.060
So that's all working very
nicely now that it's served

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:36.060
directly from a [INAUDIBLE]
folder.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:41.110
Let me go back, actually
to Neutron Drive.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.040
Yes, there was one more feature
I wanted to show you

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:46.430
on Neutron Drive here.

00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:49.290
Let's say I'm in Neutron Drive
and I'd like to work on the

00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:52.500
file with one of my colleagues
named Bob.

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:54.290
Bob's on the right-hand side
of the screen here.

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:55.750
That's Bob's computer.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.030
And I'm on the left.

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:01.270
So what I could do is
very simply share

00:17:01.270 --> 00:17:02.660
the file with Bob.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.300
His name is Bob Awesome.

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:09.440
And as I just shared it, you can
see that the file popped

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.859
up in his drive.

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:13.950
And he also has Neutron
Drive installed.

00:17:13.950 --> 00:17:19.500
So he's going to open that
file with Neutron Drive.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.960
And something very cool
just happened.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.270
The two users--

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:27.140
Anonymous User, that's
pretty strange--

00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.090
as you can see, those two users
are put in real time

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:30.726
collaboration mode.

00:17:30.726 --> 00:17:31.770
Actually, I'm going to reload.

00:17:31.770 --> 00:17:33.766
I think there was
a little bug.

00:17:33.766 --> 00:17:35.016
It didn't show Anonymous.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.730
OK, well.

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:49.070
It's not the first time a demo
fails at I/O, right?

00:17:49.070 --> 00:17:50.320
OK.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.900
And we have some realtime
collaboration

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:57.050
engineers in the room.

00:17:57.050 --> 00:17:57.950
Maybe they can do something?

00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:59.200
Just kidding.

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:02.760
Well, if things were
working correctly--

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:06.330
actually, it's quite working,
except we have this anonymous

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.230
user issue here.

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:12.060
As you can see, the two users
are put in realtime

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.150
collaboration mode.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:16.880
Everything that-- if you
select some text, the

00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.410
selection is actually shared
and displayed to the user

00:18:19.410 --> 00:18:21.490
world, in one direction.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.280
Let's pretend it was working
very nicely.

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:30.450
You could also see what the
other user is typing live.

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:34.970
So that's all pretty much
Google Docs real time

00:18:34.970 --> 00:18:36.220
collaboration here.

00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.010
This very awesome feature--
which would be even more

00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:45.440
awesome if it was working nicely
during the demos--

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.640
is actually built using one of
the APIs that we launched two

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.290
months ago, which is the Google
Drive Realtime API.

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.730
So the Google Drive Realtime API
is, as I said, basically

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:00.610
its goal is really to enable
you to build realtime

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:04.510
collaboration features,
to implement realtime

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.510
collaboration features in your
web app very easily.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:10.150
So I've actually used
the API myself.

00:19:10.150 --> 00:19:11.040
It's very nice.

00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.350
It really feels like using
regular JavaScript objects,

00:19:14.350 --> 00:19:18.520
except those objects are shared
amongst collaborators.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.000
And the API takes care a lot
of issues for you, like

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.380
persistence or conflict
resolution, or, of course, the

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:31.770
broadcasting and delivery of
modifications to all of the

00:19:31.770 --> 00:19:32.340
collaborators.

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:36.130
It also does Undo/Redo
presence.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:37.640
You get the list of people
who have your

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.400
document open at the time.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.460
This is a very, very cool API.

00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.950
It's actually one of the APIs
I'm the most excited about.

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:49.310
It's really advanced web
technology made easy for you.

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:53.720
So, yes, you should really check
it out if your app could

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:56.790
use some realtime collaboration
features, all

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.740
makes it really easy for you.

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.760
I actually wanted to show you
another app called Draw.io--

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.820
we have the founder here
on the third row--

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:09.860
which is a cool diagramming
application that also uses the

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:13.210
Google Drive Realtime API
to implement realtime

00:20:13.210 --> 00:20:14.460
collaboration.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.180
So here is Draw.io.

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:22.580
I've actually already shared my
drawing document with Bob,

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.830
who is here on the right.

00:20:26.250 --> 00:20:33.020
As I drop elements here on the
page, you can see them just

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:36.965
popping up on Bob's computer.

00:20:36.965 --> 00:20:41.310
I'm actually really bad at
making these drawings.

00:20:41.310 --> 00:20:44.300
And you get very nice visual
cues of what the other

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.770
collaborators is doing.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.905
You also have this
little chat here.

00:20:47.905 --> 00:20:49.800
You can chat with Bob.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.840
Hey, Bob.

00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.800
Wassup?

00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.820
So that chat window was actually
implemented using the

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.600
Google Drive Realtime API.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:02.260
So if you think about it, a chat
window could be almost as

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.630
simple as a collaborative or
shared list of strings.

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:10.360
Using the realtime API,
that was actually

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:11.610
quite nice to implement.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.840
All right.

00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.880
That was Draw.io.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:24.230
If you're interested in learning
more about the Google

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:27.220
Drive Realtime API, you guys
should attend Brian and

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:30.990
Sheryl's talk, which is
at 2:35 PM tomorrow.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:34.330
Yes, they're in the room.

00:21:34.330 --> 00:21:36.120
It's going to be a great talk.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.830
I think they're not only going
to talk about how you can use

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:41.920
the API yourself as a developer,
but they'll talk a

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.200
little bit about how
the API works.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:49.160
So you'll learn about things
like operational transforms

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:50.490
and a lot of different
things like that.

00:21:50.490 --> 00:21:52.600
You guys should really check it
out if you're interested.

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:56.000
All right.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.760
So one of the other features
that we launched-- that was

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.690
actually a month ago--

00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:05.270
it was actually two features.

00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:11.270
We really wanted to allow
applications to write data

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:13.310
they have complete
control over.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.660
So let me explain a bit.

00:22:15.660 --> 00:22:17.710
So, as you all know,
Google Drive is a

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:19.500
user-managed cloud storage.

00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:22.570
That would typically mean that
the user has total control

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:25.670
over the files that are
in his Google Drive.

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:29.430
He could go ahead and read any
of the files, delete or modify

00:22:29.430 --> 00:22:31.320
any of the files in his drive.

00:22:35.150 --> 00:22:38.030
It's not always the best.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:39.750
It's not always working
for every use case.

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:42.320
Let's say you have a web
application and you'd like to

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.770
write a configuration file
to Google Drive.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:47.950
Well, you wouldn't really want
the user to go ahead and mess

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.040
up that configuration file.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.160
Maybe that would make your
application have some issues

00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:55.150
when it loads.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:57.690
And probably the user doesn't
even want to see that file in

00:22:57.690 --> 00:22:58.490
the first place.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.750
He's going to be like, what the
hell is this configuration

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:01.670
file again?

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.790
I haven't created that.

00:23:03.790 --> 00:23:07.170
Same goes for a web-based
game, for example.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:10.980
What if a game would want
to Save Game State

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.420
to the user's drive.

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.550
You wouldn't really want to be
the user to be able to go and

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:17.950
potentially change what's
inside that

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:19.030
Save Game State, right?

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:21.980
The user could go in and like,
change his gold coins for

00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.660
something, and cheat,
basically.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:27.540
So it's not always working for
every use case to give total

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.310
control to the user.

00:23:31.310 --> 00:23:33.920
To mitigate this, we launched
a couple features.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.010
The first one is called
the App Data folder.

00:23:37.010 --> 00:23:41.070
The App Data folder is basically
a hidden folder that

00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.900
is only accessible to
your application.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.520
It's really private
to your app.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.710
The user doesn't even see it.

00:23:46.710 --> 00:23:48.310
It's really hidden.

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:50.670
So that really means that the
user cannot see what's inside

00:23:50.670 --> 00:23:54.750
that folder, cannot read the
files, cannot go in and modify

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.380
these files.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:24:01.330
The only thing that the user can
actually see is the amount

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.380
of data that your application
is using.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:06.600
And he sees that inside the
Manage Apps dialog, as you can

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.630
see here on the screen,
as an example.

00:24:09.630 --> 00:24:13.280
Also, the only action that a
user can take is to wipe

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.510
entirely the data.

00:24:14.510 --> 00:24:17.560
So he can just basically reset
the data for an app.

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:19.710
Or he could also uninstall
the app.

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.420
That would also wipe
the folder.

00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:25.930
So that's the App Data folder.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.960
Oh, and by the way,
in Ali's talk--

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.380
that's today at 4:25 PM--

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.050
called "Using Drive as a Storage
Solution on Android,"

00:24:34.050 --> 00:24:37.600
Ali's going to basically explain
how you can use the

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:39.620
App Data folder effectively
on Android.

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:43.170
For example, to save
the state of your

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:44.510
Android app across devices.

00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:48.610
That's really something that
developers have wanted to do

00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:51.820
for a long time, save
the state of

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.180
your app across devices.

00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:56.040
You can now do that
through Drive with

00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:56.780
the App Data folder.

00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.620
So if you're interested, you
should really show up at Ali's

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.560
talk today.

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:06.130
The second feature that allows
your application to write

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:08.910
basically app that they control
is called the Custom

00:25:08.910 --> 00:25:09.780
File Properties.

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:15.550
So Custom File Properties is
basically a way for you to

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.240
attach metadata to a file
itself in Google Drive.

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.340
There's an option to actually
make that metadata private to

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.650
your app so that only your app
can read it and access

00:25:27.650 --> 00:25:30.030
it and modify it.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.690
That's actually great for the
use cases where you would

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:38.360
actually have to keep, for
example, a folder or files in

00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.890
sync with your own system.

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:44.310
You could actually write, for
example, the ID of the file in

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:47.090
your own system and directly
attach that to the

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:50.170
application, make that private
so nobody else can modify it

00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.470
or read it.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:55.910
Basically, just like you were
attaching a foreign key to a

00:25:55.910 --> 00:25:58.130
Google Drive file.

00:25:58.130 --> 00:25:59.740
That's called Custom
File Properties.

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:06.570
That was actually all of the
major features that we

00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:10.010
launched this year concerning
Google Drive.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:13.740
And we're working on a lot more
cool features as well.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:18.290
One of the next features that
is coming up is called Push

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:18.860
Notifications.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:23.300
So hopefully, this is coming
very, very soon.

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.680
I'm saying that because
I think we also

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:27.080
announced it last year.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.580
So hopefully, this will be
available very, very soon.

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:33.710
Push Notification is really a
way for your application to

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:36.100
get notified when something
changes in the

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:38.790
user's Google Drive.

00:26:38.790 --> 00:26:41.900
For example, when the user
modifies a file or adds a new

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.260
file or deletes a file in his
drive, you could potentially

00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.470
be notified by a server
to server call.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:53.310
So that really solves some
of the issues where--

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:55.430
basically if your application
wanted to know if something

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.870
has changed in the user's drive,
they would have to

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.070
check, basically poll every five
minutes, let's say, or

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.400
every half an hour, or
every day, to see if

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.620
something has changed.

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:05.550
Well, now you won't have to
do that anymore with Push

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.090
Notifications.

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:10.010
You will, basically, almost in
real time get notified when

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:12.550
something has changed
in the user's drive.

00:27:12.550 --> 00:27:18.210
And potentially, then, get
faster notification, take

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:19.380
faster action.

00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.750
And it's a win-win, because
for us, you also put less

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.630
strain, probably,
on our servers.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.380
Instead of polling every five
minutes or every 30 minutes,

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:30.250
you'll just have to wait until
a notification arrives.

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:33.860
There's of course, a lot
more we're working on.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.380
If you'd like to actually be one
of the first to try all of

00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.740
the new upcoming features, you
should really join our SDK

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:42.910
Early Access Program.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:46.470
The SDK Early Access Program--

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:49.560
basically all of the features
that we've launched in the

00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:53.260
past six months have been
available early to our Early

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.610
Access Program members.

00:27:54.610 --> 00:27:57.530
For example, the Push
Notification system that I

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.610
just talked to you about
is currently

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.000
being tested by our--

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.560
EAP, we call them--

00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:04.010
Early Access Program members.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:09.080
So if you're interested in Drive
and want to try out some

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:14.230
really cool technology before
they launch and also help us

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:17.350
make those features right, you
should really try and join our

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.240
Early Access Program.

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:24.870
For example, the Realtime API
was really one of the features

00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:27.990
that really used some good
feedback from our Early Access

00:28:27.990 --> 00:28:29.980
Programs members.

00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:32.270
And they really made some
features happen.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:34.820
They really helped us test
the integration.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:38.170
They helped also show other
developers what can be

00:28:38.170 --> 00:28:41.240
potentially done with it.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.040
During the launch announcements
we point to the

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:45.660
apps, show what they
can do with it.

00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:49.030
So thanks again to our currently
existing Early

00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:49.970
Access Program members.

00:28:49.970 --> 00:28:53.850
And if you're interested,
check out our technical

00:28:53.850 --> 00:28:55.220
documentation on

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:59.480
developers.google.com and apply.

00:28:59.480 --> 00:28:59.890
Conclusion.

00:28:59.890 --> 00:29:03.510
So, as you've seen,
we launched Google

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:04.680
Drive a year ago.

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:09.396
Really, our goal was really not
to make it a very simple

00:29:09.396 --> 00:29:10.660
data API only.

00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:14.760
We really wanted to bring you to
bring a lot more to you, a

00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:18.580
simple programmatic access
to your files.

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:19.810
We're bringing some--

00:29:19.810 --> 00:29:23.390
we have this nice User Interface
Integration within

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:24.660
our file explorer.

00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.176
We also have all
these widgets.

00:29:27.176 --> 00:29:29.800
We even have Realtime
API now, which is

00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.700
really, really awesome.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.090
And you should check it out.

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:35.390
That's really groundbreaking.

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.620
There is, again, as I said,
a lot more coming up.

00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:42.060
So you guys should really look
for what we're doing.

00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:43.800
Read our blog.

00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.220
That's where we do all
the announcements.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.310
And keep building really
cool apps.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.680
Links.

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:54.640
You can find a lot of the links
to the technologies and

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.790
integration points that
I've talked about

00:29:56.790 --> 00:29:58.930
today during this talk.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:00.790
If you'd like to sign up to the
Early Access Program, for

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.300
example, that's here.

00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:06.950
Also, point to all the other
technologies, Realtime API.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:09.020
You should also go
to all of the

00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:11.830
sessions, the related sessions.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.260
Today there is "Using Drive
as the Storage Solution on

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.200
Android," by Ali.

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.530
And tomorrow there is "Getting
Your App Noticed Inside Google

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:22.110
Drive" and the "Realtime
API Deep Drive" talk.

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:25.050
These two are tomorrow.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:25.720
All right, that's it.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.380
I'll be happy to answer
questions.

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:28.546
Thank you very much.

00:30:28.546 --> 00:30:34.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:34.140 --> 00:30:34.810
NICOLAS GARNIER: Question.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:35.470
AUDIENCE: Hey, Nicolas.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.370
Charlie Wood from Spanning.

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:38.050
NICOLAS GARNIER: Hello.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.550
AUDIENCE: So, you showed
how users can

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:42.830
connect apps to Drive.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:45.310
Can domain admins do that?

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.010
NICOLAS GARNIER: Not yet.

00:30:47.010 --> 00:30:47.370
Not yet.

00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:50.960
It's really something that
we want domain admins

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.020
to be able to do.

00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:55.220
So your question is really, can
a domain admin connect an

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:57.930
app for all of the users of his
domain basically in like,

00:30:57.930 --> 00:31:00.110
one operation?

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:02.550
It's something we want to do,
something we're working on,

00:31:02.550 --> 00:31:05.005
but it's not available
today, unfortunately.

00:31:05.005 --> 00:31:06.255
It's coming up.

00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:12.310
Any other questions
in the room?

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.595
Yes.

00:31:12.595 --> 00:31:13.830
AUDIENCE: Hi, Nicolas.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:16.100
It's [? Winn ?] from
Smart Technologies.

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.270
We're using the Realtime API
to create a collaborative

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:21.130
whiteboarding application

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:23.310
NICOLAS GARNIER: Sorry, what
is your application doing?

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.010
AUDIENCE: It's a collaborative
whiteboarding application.

00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:26.450
NICOLAS GARNIER: OK,
whiteboarding.

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.060
AUDIENCE: So, we're very
impressed with it so far.

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:34.380
However, we're kind of wondering
in terms of storing

00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.780
data using the shared
[INAUDIBLE] data model, we're

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:40.230
kind of reaching limits in terms
of how much data we can

00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:41.350
put in that shared model.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:46.160
I'm just wondering what type
of practices we should

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.410
[INAUDIBLE]

00:31:49.186 --> 00:31:51.540
NICOLAS GARNIER: So what is
the limit you're reaching?

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:55.045
Is that the limit per
realtime model?

00:31:55.045 --> 00:31:57.120
AUDIENCE: Yes, that's correct.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:57.980
NICOLAS GARNIER: What's
the limit?

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:04.190
Actually, you have engineers
working on their Google Drive

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:07.151
Realtime APIs, so maybe they
can make that possible.

00:32:07.151 --> 00:32:08.540
AUDIENCE: I'm Brian Karens.

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:11.220
I'm an engineer on
the Realtime API.

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:14.090
Right now, we have a roughly
10 megabyte limit.

00:32:14.090 --> 00:32:16.820
It's not fixed in stone.

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:20.270
We're actually working to make
it a little more clear.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:23.020
You'll have insight into exactly
how much data you're

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:26.550
using in the model so you can
understand where you might be

00:32:26.550 --> 00:32:28.680
using space and reduce that.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.410
And we're looking at increasing
that limit over

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.110
time as performance allows.

00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:38.150
But for now, the limit
would be 10 megs.

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:39.790
NICOLAS GARNIER: You have
pretty big whiteboards.

00:32:39.790 --> 00:32:42.150
Yes.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:43.680
Is there any other questions
in the room?

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:53.380
AUDIENCE: My name is Martin.

00:32:53.380 --> 00:32:54.640
I have a couple questions.

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.380
One is the File Picker
that you released.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.810
It's very useful if
you're looking for

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:00.510
file but not a folder.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:02.350
NICOLAS GARNIER:
Yeah, we know.

00:33:02.350 --> 00:33:03.700
AUDIENCE: I knew you knew.

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.016
I wondered if you had
any updates for us.

00:33:06.016 --> 00:33:07.800
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah, it's
something we've been

00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.120
requesting.

00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.900
It's currently being
worked on.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.930
So the issue is that
you cannot--

00:33:13.930 --> 00:33:15.780
basically you can browse, and
if you double-click on a

00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:17.690
folder, it's just going
to open that folder.

00:33:17.690 --> 00:33:20.690
But you cannot select
a folder, per se.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:25.440
Yeah, we've heard lots of
requests for that feature.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:26.130
It's being worked on.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.130
I'm not sure exactly when it
will be ready, but definitely

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.440
we're working with that.

00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:36.100
AUDIENCE: Another related
question is, if we had the

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.960
application data folder, the
Custom Metadata, and we wanted

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:43.490
to share that from one user to
another, we've been looking at

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:45.990
something where we were storing
a folder in Drive so

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:48.170
we could use all that sharing.

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.080
I used the sharing widget
and shared across.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:54.110
But then the user or has
to have a file, and

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:55.370
that's kind of ugly.

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:57.870
So I was wondering if you could
advise if there's a way

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.505
around sharing files.

00:33:59.505 --> 00:34:04.130
NICOLAS GARNIER: So is your
issue, like, when there is a

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.520
file inside the Add Data
folder, basically

00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:07.540
you can share it.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.380
Is that your current issue?

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:16.020
AUDIENCE: so I hadn't realized
that there was the sharing

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.210
widget you already have.

00:34:17.210 --> 00:34:19.560
So I haven't played
exactly with that.

00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.060
But I guess we were putting a
file that was publicly visible

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.810
so that users could share the
configuration they've set up

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:27.420
with some people they want
to collaborate with.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.139
Say, here, it's all
set up for you.

00:34:29.139 --> 00:34:30.320
Here it is.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:33.650
But if they could not need to
see that, that'd be great.

00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.900
NICOLAS GARNIER: Yeah.

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:39.429
In that case, you could--

00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:42.900
well, you can, of course, try
to create your own user

00:34:42.900 --> 00:34:44.320
interface for sharing.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.400
That's probably what you've
been doing is using

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.159
the API that our--

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:52.469
AUDIENCE: Well, we use the file
so that users could use

00:34:52.469 --> 00:34:55.480
the existing sharing interface
for the file and just go and

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:56.310
share that level.

00:34:56.310 --> 00:34:57.860
But then the user has
to understand

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.660
files, and that's risky.

00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.740
NICOLAS GARNIER:
Yes, it's true.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.100
But what you could probably do
is, instead of using the

00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.750
Sharing Dialog, which is
really file oriented.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.340
We tell you the user, hey, you
want to share that file?

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:12.240
Who do you want to
share it with?

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:16.970
You could maybe probably build
your own user interface and

00:35:16.970 --> 00:35:18.825
provide your own sharing.

00:35:18.825 --> 00:35:20.720
Then you don't have to use the
[? world ?] file if you don't

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.640
want you to use it.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.350
You could just say, hey, want
to copy that configuration

00:35:24.350 --> 00:35:27.400
file that your friend
has shared with you.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.150
And you could actually
share the file or

00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:30.910
copy, make a new copy.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.530
That's probably what you
want to do for a

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:34.690
configuration file.

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.220
Basically, build your own
sharing UI would probably be

00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:39.600
better for you in that sense.

00:35:44.970 --> 00:35:46.460
Yeah.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.550
You want to take
the microphone.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:53.780
Yeah, I think related to App
Data, JDR, our tech lead on

00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.910
Google Drive, wants to--

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.220
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.520
At the moment, App Data is
completely private on the

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.700
theory that it was private
to the app.

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.680
We weren't imagining any
scenarios wherein people would

00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.500
want to share it.

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:11.440
So thank you for surfacing
this important use case.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.440
We'll talk it over as soon as
we're out of here and figure

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.032
out how to help out.

00:36:15.032 --> 00:36:17.480
NICOLAS GARNIER: Basically,
sharing is disabled for files

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.970
that are inside the App Data
folder, if you wanted to use

00:36:19.970 --> 00:36:20.980
the App Data folder.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:24.700
So as I said, what you can
probably do right now if you

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.750
want to have something working
right now, is copy that file

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:31.620
to App Data folder of
the other user.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:34.870
That'd be the only way.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.120
Thanks for your question.

00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:41.242
AUDIENCE: Spreadsheets.

00:36:41.242 --> 00:36:42.113
NICOLAS GARNIER: Spreadsheets.

00:36:42.113 --> 00:36:43.079
Oh, my God.

00:36:43.079 --> 00:36:44.045
Go ahead.

00:36:44.045 --> 00:36:46.120
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
it's the right forum.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:49.410
Can we have a more [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:51.560
maybe some groups or
users [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.290
NICOLAS GARNIER: Sorry,
can you just--

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:57.540
I didn't get your question
entirely.

00:37:00.722 --> 00:37:04.445
AUDIENCE: Like a group cannot
change a column value in

00:37:04.445 --> 00:37:06.040
[? A or B. ?]

00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.515
I know a spreadsheet now
has to be shared.

00:37:08.515 --> 00:37:12.220
It cannot have a particular
[? section of the ?] log for

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.195
some reason.

00:37:13.195 --> 00:37:15.010
NICOLAS GARNIER: So you'd
like to share a

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.260
spreadsheet with a group.

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:17.950
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:18.880
NICOLAS GARNIER: An
entire group.

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.060
I think that's possible today.

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.370
Have you been facing
issues with this?

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:23.590
For a particular column.

00:37:23.590 --> 00:37:23.990
I don't--

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:25.630
NICOLAS GARNIER: Oh, you
want to share just a

00:37:25.630 --> 00:37:27.170
column with a group.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:31.790
Well, I'm not a perfect expert
on Google Spreadsheet.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.040
I think you can--

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:36.720
I'm not sure that's--

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.500
No, I don't think that's
possible today.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:42.540
What you can do is, I think
restrict column, like Block

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.810
Columns or something.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:45.190
I'm not a super expert.

00:37:45.190 --> 00:37:47.120
So I don't think that's
possible today.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:51.990
But potentially if you file a
Feature Request and enough

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.900
people want the same feature,
we might build it.

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:57.880
I don't think you can basically
share per column.

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.588
It's not like sharing
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:09.100
AUDIENCE: So as I understood,
the App Data is [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.260
But can I write app
scripts which can

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.100
access that App Data?

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.370
NICOLAS GARNIER: Oh,
good question.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.430
Engineering team, can
we access add data

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.790
through Apps group?

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:22.130
No, I don't think so because,
through app

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:23.380
script you're not really--

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.850
well, actually can we?

00:38:27.850 --> 00:38:30.330
That would be an Add Data just
private to app script.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:32.690
The point with Add Data is
that it's private to an

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.390
application.

00:38:33.390 --> 00:38:35.970
So you have to use your
application credentials to

00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:38.390
really access it.

00:38:38.390 --> 00:38:39.590
Throughout App Script, we could

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.190
potentially make it available.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:43.490
I don't know if it's
possible today.

00:38:43.490 --> 00:38:44.640
I don't think it is.

00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:47.820
JDR will confirm or not.

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:50.730
AUDIENCE: I just pinged the
guy that works on the App

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:53.080
Script integration with Drive to
double check this, but I'm

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.980
pretty sure that the way we
work right-- we do use the

00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.530
same Google Drive API you're
using to access Google Drive

00:38:59.530 --> 00:39:00.830
from App Script.

00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:03.540
So if it's not possible, it's
only a limitation in the

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.910
interface we've designed.

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.210
So it is, in principle,
possible.

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:11.460
We may not have the interface
quite ready.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:15.050
You should attend John McGowan's
talk later today

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:17.290
about App Script integration
with Drive, where he will go

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.740
into these topics
in great detail.

00:39:18.740 --> 00:39:19.700
And he's the expert on this.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.120
NICOLAS GARNIER: And
you can ask him.

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:26.290
If that was working, I think all
of your App Scripts would

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.330
basically share the
same App Data.

00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:29.590
Because that would be
seen as the same

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:32.430
application through the API.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.920
That's how it would work.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.100
Is there any other questions?

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.730
Yes.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:43.220
AUDIENCE: You have a really
awesome feature of publishing

00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:45.170
the HTML from Drive.

00:39:45.170 --> 00:39:48.780
Is there any way we can just
have that for Google Apps

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.160
users so it could be restricted
to a domain?

00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:57.840
NICOLAS GARNIER: I know the team
has been wanting to make

00:39:57.840 --> 00:40:00.640
this work with the
Sharing settings.

00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.540
Right now it only works
for public--

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.030
you have to make the public.

00:40:04.030 --> 00:40:08.880
I think they were speaking about
also allowing it for

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.990
even protected documents so
that you could share, for

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.820
example, a folder just
with your domain.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:18.220
Then the website would only be
available to your domain.

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:22.310
I'm not sure how far they are
with this or if they are still

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:24.930
going to this direction.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:25.690
I have to double-check.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.480
But that's something they wanted
to do from the start.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:31.920
It's just harder.

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:32.460
It's harder.

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:35.050
It's all in a sub-domain.

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.260
You have to know who's
signed in.

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:42.340
So that's a bit technically
harder .

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.590
Any other questions?

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:47.560
All right, well, thank
you, everybody,

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:49.880
for coming and listening.

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:54.093
