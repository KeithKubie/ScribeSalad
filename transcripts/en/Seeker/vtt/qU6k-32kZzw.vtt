Kem cho!

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:03.270
That means “how are you?” in the Indian
language Gujarati.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.940
I understand it fluently but I don’t remember
learning it at all.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.080
So what the heck happened?

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.010
Hey guys what’s up I’m Sapna here for
DNews.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.000
Learning a second language is technically
referred to as “second language acquisition”.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.380
That’s because acquisition and learning
are not quite the same.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.220
ACQUIRING a second language is a subconscious
process but LEARNING a language is a conscious

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.669
process based on formal instruction.

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.070
Both are important.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.950
In 1967 linguist and neuroscientist Eric Lenneberg
popularized the Critical Period Hypothesis.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.080
It’s a theory that proposed the best age
range to acquire a new language.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.910
Lenneberg said the critical period was age
2 to 13- that’s around the age you reach

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.910
puberty.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.150
Now, this age range is debated by language
experts and today they prefer to call it the

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.800
“SENSITIVE period” instead of the “CRITICAL
period”.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.870
That’s because it’s not SO CRITICAL that
you learn a language during THAT TIME period

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.100
only… it’s actually never too late!

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.730
BUT research shows there are advantages to
starting early and here’s why…

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.190
Kids brains are way better than adults when
it comes to LEARNING because of their plasticity

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.100
- their brains are just better at creating
new neural pathways.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.660
It does that through the creation of new SYNAPSES…
the connective junctions where one neuron

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.990
talks to another using electrical and chemical
signals.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.500
Shortly after birth, synapses form at a rate
that’s faster than any other time period

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.710
in our lives - it’s known as the exuberant
period where a young brain can create up to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.420
2 million synapses every second.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.250
The NUMBER of synapses you have peaks between
the ages of 4 to 8, but your brain still has

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.940
a lot of plasticity until puberty.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.840
THAT is why exposure to language at an early
age makes such a big difference.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.240
Now… although Lenneberg’s ‘Critical
Period’ hypothesis states that that the

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.200
ideal window to acquire language is age 2
to 13, synapses in the brain’s cortex actually

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.909
start forming much earlier than that- during
the second trimester of pregnancy.

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.790
And there’s pretty convincing research that
shows language development starts before a

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.039
baby’s even born.. so it’s probably never
too SOON for a pregnant mother to speak to

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.099
her baby.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.019
And If you are past puberty- don’t worry,
it’s not too LATE either...

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.709
Yea kids brains are more ADAPTABLE and better
at making new brain connections but ADULT

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.730
brains are better at focusing and better at
complex thought processes.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.239
In fact, adults are FASTER at learning a new
language.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.810
SO aLthough kids are better at SUBCONSCIOUSLY
acquiring a language .. adults may be better

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.249
at conscious, systematic, learning.

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:36.620
AND your BRAIN is NOT the only thing that
matters.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.939
There are external factors like who’s teaching
you the language? and are you around native

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:42.930
speakers of that language.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.719
And there are internal factors like personality.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:50.099
If you’re outgoing you’re more likely
to practice and not be so afraid to make mistakes.

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.299
And then there’s motivation - if you enjoy
learning a language or if you really want

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.939
to communicate with a hot new boyfriend or
girlfriend.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.390
It sounds cheesy but studies shows you’ll
be more successful!

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.129
There is a catch to learning a language as
adult.

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.069
The research shows you’re probably not gonna
nail an authentic accent...no matter how hard

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:10.299
you try, you’re going to sound like a foreigner.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.430
But that’s ok because did you know that
being bilingual could make you smarter?

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:33.989
Trace and Alice explain in this video

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.599
Do you speak a second language?

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.959
Or third or 4th?

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:38.469
If so how did you learn it?

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:40.680
And do you have any advice on what worked
and what didn’t?

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.109
Tell us down in the comments section!
