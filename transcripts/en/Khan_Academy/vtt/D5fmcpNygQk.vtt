00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.660
Let's multiply 1.21,
or 1 and 21 hundredths,

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.336
times 43 thousandths, or 0.043.

00:00:09.336 --> 00:00:10.960
And I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.540
and try it on your own.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.490
So let's just think about a
very similar problem but one

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.560
where essentially we
don't write the decimals.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.550
Let's just think about
multiplying 121 times 43,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.517
which we know how to do.

00:00:25.517 --> 00:00:27.100
So let's just think
about this problem

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.269
first as kind of
a simplification,

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.560
and then we'll think about
how to get from this product

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.120
to this product.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.020
So we can start with-- so we're
going to say 3 times 1 is 3.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.920
3 times 2 is 6.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.650
3 times 1 is 3.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.927
3 times 121 is 363.

00:00:45.927 --> 00:00:47.760
And now we're going to
go to the tens place,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.950
so this is a 40 right over here.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.750
So since we're in the tens
place, let's put a 0 there.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.900
40 times 1 is 40.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.682
40 times 20 is 800.

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:04.970
40 times 100 is 4,000.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.410
And we've already known
how to do this in the past,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.210
and now we can just add
all of this together.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.880
And we get-- let me do a new
color here-- 3 plus 0 is 3.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.940
6 plus 4 is 10.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.340
1 plus 3 plus 8 is 12.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.660
1 plus 4 is 5.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.970
So 121 times 43 is 5,203.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.240
Now, how is this useful for
figuring out this product?

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.890
Well, to go from
1.21 to 121, we're

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.020
essentially multiplying by 100.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.610
Right?

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.600
We're moving the decimal two
places over to the right.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.930
And to go from 0.043 to
43, what are we doing?

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.700
We're removing the
decimal, so we're

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.630
multiplying by ten,
hundred, thousand.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.730
We're multiplying by 1,000.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.480
So to go from this
product to this product

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.720
or to this product, we
essentially multiplied by 100,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.530
and we multiplied by 1,000.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.350
So then to go back to this
product, we have to divide.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.700
We should divide by
100 and then divide

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.650
by 1,000, which is equivalent
to dividing by 100,000.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.920
But let's do that.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.569
So let's rewrite this
number here, so 5,203.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.985
Actually let me
write it like this

00:02:33.985 --> 00:02:39.570
just so it's a little
bit more aligned, 5,203.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.240
And we could imagine a
decimal point right over here.

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.150
If we divide by 100-- so you
divide by 10, divide by 100--

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.520
and then we want to
divide by another 1,000.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.620
So divide by 10, divide
by 100, divide by 1,000.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.510
So our decimal point is
going to go right over there,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.260
and we're done.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.900
1.21 times 0.043 is 0.05203.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.270
So one way you could think about
it is just multiply these two

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.240
numbers as if there
were no decimals there.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.394
Then you could count
how many digits

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:17.060
are to the right of
the decimal, and you

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.500
see that there are one,
two, three, four, five

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.980
digits to the right
of the decimal,

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.790
and so in your product, you
should have one, two, three,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.680
four, five digits to the
right of the decimal.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.497
Why is that the case?

00:03:37.497 --> 00:03:39.580
Well, when you ignored the
decimals, when you just

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.360
pretended that this
was 121 times 43,

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.570
you essentially multiplied
this times 100,000--

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.985
by 100 and 1,000-- and so to
get from the product you get

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:51.860
without the decimals to
the one that you need

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.450
with the decimals, you have to
then divide by 100,000 again.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.520
Multiplied by 100,000
is essentially

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.210
equivalent to moving the decimal
place five places to the right,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.110
and then dividing by 100,000
is equivalent to the moving

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.540
the decimal five
digits to the left.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.530
So divide by 10, divide
by 100, divide by 1,000,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.475
divide by 10,000,
divide by 100,000.

00:04:18.475 --> 00:04:20.779
And either way, we are done.

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:24.660
This is what we get.
