The John W. Kluge Center is
pleased to host today's symposium,

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.230
The Emergence of Life on the
Earth, in the Lab and Elsewhere,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.150
which has been organized and will
be led by Dr. Nathaniel Comfort,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.040
who is the Blumberg NASA/Library
of Congress Chair in Astrobiology.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.990
The Kluge Center is a vibrant
Center for scholarly research

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.760 position:56%
on Capitol Hill that brings together
individuals from around the world

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.190
to exchange ideas and learn from
one another, to distill wisdom

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.840
from the Library's rich
resources and to interact

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.240
with policymakers and the public.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.270
The Center offers opportunities
for senior scholars

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.700
and postdoctoral fellows

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.300
to do research using the
unparalleled collections

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.300
of The Library of Congress.

It offers free public
lectures, conferences, symposia

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.620
and other programs and it
administers the Kluge Prize,

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.210
which recognizes outstanding
lifetime achievement

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.890

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.760
The Blumberg Chair in
Astrobiology is a result

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.640 position:56%
of what has been a unique and
rewarding collaboration between NASA

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.710
and The Library of Congress.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.380
It takes its name from Nobel Prize
Winner Baruch Barry, Blumberg,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.090
Founder of the NASA Astrobiology
Institute and a Founding Member

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.820
of The Library of Congress
Scholars Council.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.620 position:56%
Dr. Blumberg envisioned the creation
of a Chair in the Kluge Center

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.450
that would focus on the humanistic

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.770
and societal impacts
of astrobiology.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.220
Nathaniel Comfort is the third
person to hold the Blumberg Chair,

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.630
and I'm delighted to say that
the two previous Chair holders,

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.290
David Grinspoon and Steven Dick,
as well as the incoming Chair,

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.020
Luis Campos, are all with us today.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.990
And please note that we are
currently accepting applications

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.990
for the 2017-2018 Chair.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.140
As I hope any of the past Chairs
will tell you this is a fantastic

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.360
opportunity to spend a year
of research, reflection

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.250
and writing at the Kluge Center.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.760
The application is
available on our website

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.710
and the submission
deadline is December 1st,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:11.870 position:56%
so please consider applying yourself
or encouraging others to do so.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.200
It has been a true pleasure
to have Nathaniel with us

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.810
at the Kluge Center this year.

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.020
He spent his time examining the
history of the genomic revolution

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.130
and origin of life research.

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.130
Dr. Comfort is a Professor in
the Department of the History

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.290
of Medicine at Johns
Hopkins University.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.510
He has published several
books and scores of articles,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.890
including his book, The
Science of Human Perfection,

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.170
How Genes Became the Heart
of American Medicine.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.090
He has written for The
Atlantic, The Nation,

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.170
The New York Times Book
Review, among others.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.250
His blog is
Genotopia.scienceblog.com

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.310
and he tweets from @nccomfort.

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.270
Before Nathaniel takes the stage
to launch today's program I would

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.300
like to invite Dr. Mary Voytek, the
Senior Scientist for Astrobiology

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:56.430
at NASA, to the podium to give
some introductory remarks.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.730
Dr. Voytek?

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary Voytek: Well, thank you very
much for allowing me to do this,

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:09.200
and I'm delighted that this is the
third or fourth time I've been able

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.600
to be up on this podium and
I hope we continue it along

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.650
into the rest of the
decade at least.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.690
The Kluge Center agreement
that we have

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.530
with NASA has been
extremely important

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.810
to explore an area that's
fundamental to NASA's mission,

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.150
which is looking at the
societal implications

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.560
of the work that we do at NASA.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.640
The search for life has been
part of our original mission

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.940
and a responsibility to the
public has always been a part

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.870
of our mission, both
to inform and educate,

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.940
to let you know what we're doing,
and also to establish studies

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.920
to look at the consequences
and benefits of the exploration

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.750
that we're doing in space.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.970
And one of the things
that we have typically

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.840
or we generally focus
on are enabling science.

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.150
So I run a research program that
actually funds research projects

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.370
to understand the origins and
evolution of life here on earth

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.990
in order to characterize the
sort of habitats we might look

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.190
for life elsewhere in the
solar system and beyond.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:18.500
But one of the areas that we have
not made a substantial impact

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:21.070
on is really evaluating
the societal impacts.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.600
And the Kluge Center and this Chair
has served a very important role

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.340
in allowing us to bring in scholars
from the humanities, philosophy,

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.350
theology, history, many other
scholars besides scientists

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.310
to interact with scientists

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.180
to actually explore these
very important issues.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.000
So I should have probably begun

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.490 position:56%
by saying what can you imagine being
more exciting than our discovery

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.460
of life somewhere else
in our universe?

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.150
And I think that this last half
decade or so has been remarkable

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.870
in encouraging us and informing
us on what that search should look

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.350
like in looking for it and
the possibility of finding it.

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.940
I just highlight that
it's two years ago

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:09.270
that we discovered
the first XO-planet.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.130 position:56%
We suspected that there were planets
that were orbiting other stars,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:14.010
but we actually confirmed it.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:18.190
And then since then we've
actually discovered thousands

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.070
of planets orbiting stars and
at least a couple dozen that are

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:26.310
in what are the so-called
habitable zone, that's the distance

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:28.550
from a star that allows a planet

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.380
to actually have a hospitable
environment on its surface

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:37.020
that could potentially
support life as we know it.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:41.320
And now when you look up into the
sky you're not looking at stars,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.760
but you're looking at suns
and around each and every one

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.250
of those suns we imagine
are planets.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.940
So the billions and billions and
billions of stars are now billions

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.490
and bazillions of planets and that
has to be incredibly exciting,

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.860
that you yourself can observe.

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.780 position:56%
We've spent the last several decades
exploring the habitability on Mars

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:05.080
and we're learning more and more.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.430
You know, our mantra has
always been look for the water

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.050
and we're finding water everywhere.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:13.560
And our most recent launch last
week, we launched OSIRIS-Rex,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.020
which is a mission that's going out
to take a sample from an asteroid.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.950
And one of the things that
we believe about those bodies

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:23.210
in our solar system is they are
responsible for delivering water

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.310
and organics, two essential
things for life, to our planets

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.830
and delivering it to other
places around our solar system

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.910
that might create habitable
environments.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:38.200
In addition, we've started looking
at extending what we used to think

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:42.500
of as a habitable zone, where
earth is in the sweet spot,

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.990
but looking at places like
the moons that orbit Saturn,

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:49.470
the giant planets, gas
planets, Saturn and Jupiter,

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:52.270
and looking at the
so-called ocean worlds.

00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:56.070
And we're pleased to see that
this has caught the imagination

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.950
of our policymakers and
lawmakers and now we have funding.

00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.980
In fact, we just got - we
usually get unfunded mandates,

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.160
so if somebody decides
we need to do something

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:09.300
and we don't typically
get money, and this year,

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.230
past year we got a
funded non-mandate,

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:14.740
that basically said we think
ocean worlds is really important

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.600
for exploration at NASA and we
want you to go set something up.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.540
And it wasn't, you know, we didn't
have a lot of strings attached

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.500
and it allowed us to really
explore what might be needed

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.910
to really move forward.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:28.020
And the moons that I'm talking
about are in Enceladus and Europa,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.260
and so I'm sure you've
heard a lot about this.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.220
Enceladus, in particular,
is a moon of Saturn

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:37.640
that has been spewing its interior
ocean, which we believe Europa has

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.260
as well, out into space and so
we want to have the opportunity

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.260
to explore these new planets

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.560
or new planetary bodies
that could support life.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.680
I would also just say, my
last comment, as you may know

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.780
that very recently, I think it
was within the last two weeks,

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.800
maybe last week, losing
track of time,

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.100
it's the end of the fiscal year,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.350
kind of crazy at a government
agency, but there was a report

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:06.030
that scientists had found
evidence of life here on earth

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.590
at 3.7 billion years ago.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:13.790 position:56%
That means that it took much less
time than we may have thought before

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:17.190
for life to start from nothing,
just the building blocks,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:20.430
and to have it have arisen to the
point where there's enough of it

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:22.890
around that we were able
to detect it somewhere.

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.470
And that's a phenomenal discovery,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:28.470
so now we have all these planets
orbiting stars, we have planets

00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:32.070
that seem to be in the right
space that could support life,

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.930
and now we know that
it's maybe not as hard

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.600
as we thought for life to occur.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.980
So we at NASA and the Astrobiology
Program think it's highly likely

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:42.920
that we're going to find
life somewhere else.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:46.910
And when we do we need to know what
all of the public thinks about it

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:49.760
and this seminar is going to
address some of those things.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:51.070
So thank you very much.

00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:52.370
Thank you so much, Nathaniel.

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.810
This is a great lineup, and
thank you all for coming.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:07.060
[ Applause ]

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.360
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Okay, well,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:12.580
thank you very much,
Mary, for those remarks.

00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:17.610
And I just want to say that if we
do find life elsewhere it's going

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:20.300
to be a very long time before
it evolves into something

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.340
as cool as the Kluge Center.

00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.970
I have had an absolutely
marvelous time this year.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:32.350
I've gotten to do all sorts of - I
had all sorts of great adventures,

00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:36.170
not least including getting to
go bowling with Astrobiologists

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.280
at the White House,
which was really awesome.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.350 position:56%
Mary, I think, got a strike, I got a
couple strikes, it was really cool.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:47.180
And I've been poking around the
thermal pools at Yellowstone.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.690
I've gotten out to the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:53.510
and made chemical gardens.

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:59.050
The access - the Library is
an obvious and incredible set

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:03.700
of resources, but NASA also
provides an amazing set

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.610
of resources that we can draw upon.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.200
And getting to have both of those
and try to pull that together

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.340
into something meaningful
has been a tremendous treat.

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:17.740
So I just wanted to give
you a very brief sort

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:19.590
of conceptual overview
of the conference.

00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:23.380
I'm not going to take long
before we can turn it over

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:25.400
and begin the actual sessions.

00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.700
But I wanted to tell
you a little bit.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.380
Well, first of all, let me
just thank everybody here

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.190
at the Kluge Center for their --

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.820
this is an amazing team
of incredibly professional

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.820
and friendly and warm people.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.500
Jason Steinhauer, Dan Turello,
and especially JoAnne Kitching,

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.100
the Administrator here, who
keeps everything together,

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.920
and John [inaudible] does an
incredible job with the AV.

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.340
So thank you to everybody.

00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:57.990
Oh, and not to forget
Emily, also a very,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.090
very important member of the team.

00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.090
So thank you.

00:12:05.090 --> 00:12:13.170
Okay, so my project is, Mary said,
has been to examine the history,

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:17.170
the recent history of
origin of life research.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:21.560
In the last 35 or 40 years the
way scientists have thought

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.170
about the origin of life
has changed dramatically.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:30.490
It is, historians shy away from
the word scientific revolution,

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:35.000
it's become kind of a cliche,
but it's a scientific revolution.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.460
The old, what you learned about
the primordial soup and all

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.010
that stuff is gone, the
soup is out the window,

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:48.190
and there are whole new ways of
thinking about how life emerges

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.170
and it's a tremendously
exciting period.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:55.160
And so I've been trying to
piece some of that together,

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.250
and so that's been my project.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:01.740
And what I wanted to do today was
to bring together groups of people

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.730
who are working on different
aspects of that problem.

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:10.270
And one of my favorite things to
do is to get people who rarely talk

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:14.230
to each other in a serious way,
together talking in a serious way.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:20.560
So I have invited historians,
philosophers, scientists

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:28.340
and science writers to bring their
expertise to bear on questions

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:35.720
of the search for life, the origins
of life on earth and in the lab,

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:40.680
which means synthetic biology,
efforts to create life in the lab

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:46.860
and a lot of overlap with
the search for or the study

00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.170
of the possible mechanisms of
the origins of life on earth.

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.290
Some people, such as Steve
Bennett [Assumed Spelling],

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.870
have actually worked
in both of those areas.

00:13:56.870 --> 00:14:01.830
And then, of course, all of
that bears upon the search

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:06.180
for the possibility of life as
we know it on other planets.

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:10.100
So these are all very
much integrated dimensions

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.120
of astrobiology.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:19.260 position:56%
And I am absolutely thrilled to have
such a great group of experts here.

00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:25.060
These are some of the absolute
top people in their areas,

00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.100
and you all should
feel very privileged

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:31.020
to get a chance to
meet all these folks.

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.170
And I encourage you at coffee
break to try to engage them.

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:36.580
They're also all very
nice warm people.

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:42.570
So, with that, I think we're going
to turn it over to Nsikan Akpan,

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:50.900
who is with the PBS New Hour,
Senior Science Producer, is that -

00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:55.930
with them, and he is going to
be moderating the first session.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:15:00.630
What I've done is asked some of
the best science writers I know

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:03.130
to moderate these sessions.

00:15:03.130 --> 00:15:08.860 position:56%
What they're great at is
interpreting science and scholarship

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.370
in ways that the regular people
can understand and really good

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.590
at interviewing people and
pulling out the important themes.

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:17.840
So I've asked them to do
that, and they're going

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.520
to be leading some
discussion with the panelists

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.110
and fielding questions
with the audience, okay?

00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:27.330
So, with that, Nsikan?

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:38.520
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Hello, everyone.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:41.630
I just want to start by
thanking The Library of Congress,

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.350
NASA and the Kluge
Center for inviting me

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:47.510
to moderate what I think is going
to be a very fascinating panel.

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:50.730
The title of that panel is The
Emergence of Life on Earth,

00:15:50.730 --> 00:15:53.700
and we have one programming note

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:57.850
in that Jim Cleaves couldn't make
it today due to a personal matter.

00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.400
So our first speaker
is actually going

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.230
to be our last speaker, Nathaniel.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.140
Nathaniel, as you heard, is
the Blumberg/NASA Library

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.170
of Congress Chair in Astrobiology
here at the Kluge Center.

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:11.410
He's also a Professor
of History and Medicine

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:15.340
at the Johns Hopkins University.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.690
And his current research
focuses on the origin of life

00:16:18.690 --> 00:16:22.480
and his talk today is going
to focus on the creation

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.070
of the early genetic code.

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.650
Our other speaker is Matt Schrenk.

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:30.290
He's Assistant Professor
in the Departments of Earth

00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:34.540
and Environmental Sciences and
Microbiology and Molecular Genetics

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:37.450
at Michigan State University.

00:16:37.450 --> 00:16:41.220
His research studies
microbial activities

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:45.410
in hydrothermal environments
in the deep sea and deep earth.

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:50.930
And his recent publications have
focused on genomics based methods

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.320
to study the function and evolution
of these microbes in order to sort

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.000
of glean a picture of what early
microbes might have looked like.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.550
So, with no further ado, Nathaniel?

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:13.020
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: All
right, first, let me just say

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:19.870
that this is very much a work in
progress because this is stuff

00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:23.500
that I've been doing
all this past year.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.550
So some of the data for
this talk has actually come

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:30.070
in this week, so please
bear with me.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:32.090
A lot of this is new,
I've been really trying

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:35.650
to integrate a lot of new material.

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:40.640
But if you can bear with me, and
it gets a little geeky at times,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.530
I admit, but if you
bear with me I'm going

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.890
to give you all you need to know.

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:50.500
You don't have to be a technical
scientist to understand this,

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:56.570
and if you do you'll have a
better appreciation I think

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.310
of how science works
and why we think

00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:02.720
about the origins of
life the way we do.

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:06.390
I open with one of my
favorite illustrations

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:09.960
by M.C. Escher, Three Worlds.

00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:14.460
In one sense this is all
one world, of course, right?

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.460
Yet the tree and the carp
are unaware of each other.

00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.980
The pond surface, the
interface between the two,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.990
reflects one and reveals the other.

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.620
In the world of the
picture it constructs both.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:32.740
Well, I want to do something
similar to that with one

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:40.550
of the central concepts in origin
of life research, the RNA world.

00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:44.640
The usual explanation of what
the RNA world is goes something

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.490
like this.

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:50.010
There's a chicken-and-egg problem
at the heart of modern biology.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:55.800
Most of the genes spelled out in
our DNA encode the instructions

00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:57.760
for making proteins.

00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.130
Among the most important proteins
are enzymes, complex molecules

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:04.810
that catalyze biological reactions.

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:11.980
Among the reactions that enzymes
catalyze are the synthesis of DNA.

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.330
In other words, you can't
make proteins without genes

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:16.300
and you can't make
genes without proteins.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:20.280
How did this system evolve?

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.040
The RNA world breaks
this infinite loop.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.590 position:56%
Differing from DNA by only one atom
it's capable of storing information,

00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:31.820
just like DNA, but it's
usually single stranded,

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.570
which means it's more
chemically reactive than DNA.

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:41.630 position:56%
In fact, in the 1980s researchers
found that RNA can act as an enzyme.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:46.570
It can then in theory copy itself,

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:50.800
perhaps it also evolved
a way to make proteins.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:54.990
So proof there goes the
chicken-and-egg problem

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:59.350
and a bird-like dinosaur
gave rise to both, all right?

00:19:59.350 --> 00:20:01.350
That's the RNA world.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:06.180
So the RNA world then
describes a time very early

00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:13.540
in evolution before DNA, before
protein, when RNA did both jobs.

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:19.150 position:56%
Eventually it handed off information
storage to DNA, which is more stable

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:24.930
and can copy itself very easily,
and it handed off most catalysis

00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:29.030
to proteins, which are more
complex and versatile and,

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.330
therefore, more powerful.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:38.220
The canonical history of the
RNA world is very simple.

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.990
In the 1960s the researchers
first speculated

00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:46.260
on the idea of RNA catalysis.

00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:51.480 position:56%
The first person always mentioned
is Francis Crick of Watson and Crick

00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:56.790
and the double helix, and often
usually mentioned is his colleague,

00:20:56.790 --> 00:20:58.090
Leslie Orgel.

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.480
Sometimes the renegade
Microbiologist,

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.390
Carl Woese, is also mentioned.

00:21:04.390 --> 00:21:08.370
Then people say there was a
period in which not much was done

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:12.500
with this idea because it was just
a speculation and no one knew what

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:18.230
to do with it until in the early
'80s RNA catalysis was actually

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:26.570
found twice by Tom Cech's group
at Colorado and then independently

00:21:26.570 --> 00:21:29.070
by Sidney Altman's [Assumed
Spelling] group at Yale.

00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:34.270
And then shortly thereafter
the RNA world was articulated

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:38.210
by Walter Gilbert in 1986.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:41.770
And that's sort of it.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:46.000 position:56%
Well, surprise, surprise, I've found

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.900
that there's a lot
more to it than that.

00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.960
There is a rich context and
an earlier history going back

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:57.030
to the early 1950s that I
can only weigh that today.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:01.780
I'm going to spend most of my
time cutting into this period

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.930
in which supposedly nothing
happened and I'm going to close

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:12.090
with a few remarks on how this
narrative of the RNA world

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:18.310
that people understand was carved
out of all of this other stuff

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.610
that I'm going to be talking about.

00:22:19.610 --> 00:22:23.540
My hope is to give you at least a
taste of what was really at stake

00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.040
in the creation of the RNA world.

00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.610
So here briefly are the remarks
that earned the early guys' credit

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:33.920
for predicting the RNA world.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:40.980
In his 1967 book, The
Genetic Code, Carl Woese wrote

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.910
of the era of nucleic acid life.

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:48.070
This was based on a speculative
and later disproven idea

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:51.890
about the function of the
molecule transfer RNA,

00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:54.920
and in this Woese concluded

00:22:54.920 --> 00:23:00.430
that a proto RNA could have
been the original genome.

00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:03.470
Then the next year
Francis Crick imagined

00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:09.150 position:56%
that the primitive protein synthesis
machinery could have been made

00:23:09.150 --> 00:23:12.150
entirely of RNA.

00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:17.520 position:56%
In a companion paper in the same
journal his colleague, Leslie Orgel,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.600
said that a primordial protein
only world was impossible

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:26.610
because of the nature of
proteins they're not able

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:30.430
to template their own replication

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:35.660
and a nucleic acid only
world was possible,

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:38.550
but he said it wouldn't
have gotten very far,

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:43.080
it wouldn't have gotten past
what he called the stage

00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:49.070
of evolutionary doodling until
it had evolved a genetic code

00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:55.500
to link nucleic acids
and proteins, okay?

00:23:55.500 --> 00:24:03.220 position:56%
So my main point here is simply that
because the early RNA world evolved

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.920
around the genetic code

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:09.380
and its origin it presumed
the existence of protein.

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.480
That's not true for
the later RNA world.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:18.680
So thinking about the genetic
code implies an RNA protein world.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:24.140
Because today is - oh, and
here's the RNA protein world,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:25.940
this is the genetic code.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:30.670
And so even from these
brief snippets it's obvious

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:33.590
that all these three were
writing in the context

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.310
of making proteins, right?

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:38.080
The genetic code and
the nucleotide sequence

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:44.310
of the transfer RNA had just been
solved in the preceding years,

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.960
in the 1960s, crowning
touches on a decade's worth

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.100
of spectacular research
characterizing the machinery

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:55.750
involved in reading out
the nucleic acid sequence

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:59.020
and converting it into proteins.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.670
And the whole complicated
process was shot through with RNA.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:08.790
We had messenger RNA,
transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA.

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:15.510
And so molecular biologists saw
the flow of genetic information

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.350
through the cell as one of
the defining essences of life

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.720
and this essence was
mediated by RNA.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.020
Even though they weren't trained

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.230
in evolutionary biology they
immediately recognized the question

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.160
of how something is
abstract and self-referential

00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:37.080
as the genetic code could
have evolved and that

00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.460
that was a knotty and
important problem.

00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.970
So this is the RNA protein world.

00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.440
Now because my focus today is
mainly on Walter Gilbert I'm going

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.730 position:56%
to jump forward a few years to 1976.

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:52.680
That year Gilbert and
his student, Allan Maxam,

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:57.000
invented a new technique
for sequencing DNA.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.530
The paper describing the method
was published in February of 1977.

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:08.200
This followed the method invented
by Frederick Sanger in 1975,

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.700
but Maxam-Gilbert sequencing
was a good deal faster

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.230
and it became the method of
choice for sequencing DNA

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:19.070
until automated DNA
sequencing came in in the 1990s,

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:23.650
which sort of sent us hurtling
toward the human genome project.

00:26:23.650 --> 00:26:26.930
Gilbert had trained as a
physicist, but had been immersed

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:31.040
in the RNA world since
the mid-1950s.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:36.250
He had participated in the
discovery of messenger RNA in 1960

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:40.510
and he shared the laboratory
of Jim Watson, the other half

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.710
of Watson and Crick at Harvard.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:48.320
And in 1976 Watson moved
down to Long Island

00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.890
to become fulltime Director of
Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:55.440
and bequeathed his
entire lab to Gilbert,

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.080
and Gilbert did some pretty
interesting things there.

00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:04.520
So in the spring of 1977 the
immunologist, Susumu Tonegawa,

00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:11.250
visited Gilbert's lab and in order
to sequence some of the genes

00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:16.780 position:56%
that he was finding for
immunoglobulins, important molecules

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:20.590
that create the antigens
that recognize the antibodies

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:22.270
in our immune system, okay?

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:26.650
And Gilbert says when
he says Tonegawa came

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:29.850
to sequence it he meant
that Maxam sequenced it.

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:37.260
And Maxam found when he was doing
this, found this 93 base sequence

00:27:37.260 --> 00:27:41.510
that appeared to be skipped
over during transcription.

00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:48.170
So the messenger RNA from the
gene was missing this chunk

00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.270
of DNA, right?

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.350
And they didn't quite
know what to do with that,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:28:00.610
but that June they went down to
Long Island to the Annual Symposium

00:28:00.610 --> 00:28:03.050
at Cold Spring Harbor
Lab where they heard

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.650
about a stunning new
development in gene structure

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.600
in higher organisms or eukaryotes.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.580
Independently Richard Roberts, a
scientist at Cold Spring Harbor,

00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:17.300
and Phil Sharp, who had been at
Cold Spring Harbor but was now

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:22.290
by this time at MIT, performed
essentially the same experiment.

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:29.060 position:56%
They captured the messenger RNA from
a viral gene and then hybridized it

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:33.750
to the original DNA gene, and
when they did so and looked at it

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:39.370
under the electron microscope
they found these loops, okay?

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:46.430
So the messenger RNA, you can
see, is binding to the DNA

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:51.040
and it's skipping over
chunks of the DNA.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:55.540
In other words, the DNA
gene existed in segments

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:58.010
with little spacers
in between them, okay?

00:28:58.010 --> 00:29:04.210 position:56%
This was one of the many discoveries
in science that made anomalies

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:08.200
in other researchers'
data suddenly make sense.

00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:12.430
Rich Roberts told me back in
1993 they all had the data

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:16.870
in their notebooks, all they had to
do was go back and reinterpret it.

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.460
Gilbert went back and
reinterpreted it.

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:25.460
So after the symposium
he took a trip to Europe.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:29.590
Gilbert likes to travel the
world, and he went to Switzerland

00:29:29.590 --> 00:29:33.960
to visit Tonegawa, he went to
Poland to visit another scientist.

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:40.330
And as he was traveling around
he said he had a big idea.

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:45.230
The genes weren't in pieces,
he thought, they weren't just

00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:48.450
in pieces, he thought,
they must be modular.

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:54.450
He imagined that the coding regions
represented ancient mini genes

00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:57.560
that would have functioned on
their own and he was already

00:29:57.560 --> 00:30:01.230
by this time calling the
intervening sequences introns

00:30:01.230 --> 00:30:04.120
and the coding regions exons, okay?

00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.530
And the evolutionary role
of introns, he thought,

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.870
was to enable the exons
to be shuffled in order

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:16.730
to rapidly create complex genes.

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:20.060
When I came back to Harvard for
the fall term, Gilbert told me,

00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:23.600
I was very excited about the
exon shuffling idea and gave it

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.170
as a seminar, centering
on the idea that genes

00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:29.090
and pieces might explain
the Cambrian evolution,

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:30.390
Cambrian explosion.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:36.760
The evolutionary burst around 540
million years ago in which most

00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:40.020
of the major animal phyla appeared.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.040
Introns had not been seen in
bacteria, they'd only been seen

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.520
in eukaryotes, higher organisms.

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:51.340
So if, as many people believed,
simple prokaryotes, like bacteria,

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:56.440
had evolved into complex
eukaryotes then Gilbert thought the

00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.740
introduction of introns could
have sped the diversification

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:04.450
of higher organisms leading
to the Cambrian explosion.

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:09.400
Now note that this reasoning is
based on a lot of assumptions

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.090
that are no longer believed
as to be true, okay?

00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:13.390
But this is the way he was thinking

00:31:13.390 --> 00:31:17.200
and it was reasonable
thinking at the time.

00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:22.200
So Ford Doolittle began a
sabbatical year in Gilbert's lab

00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.410
that same fall, when Gilbert
came back all excited.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:31.300
And he remembers Gilbert's
seminar and he told me

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:34.130
that afterward he went
home that night

00:31:34.130 --> 00:31:38.370
and wrote an essay in response.

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:41.500
Doolittle had trained
under Carl Woese,

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:46.370
who was at this time campaigning
heavily to get rid of this idea

00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:51.270
of a prokaryote to eukaryote
progression in evolution.

00:31:51.270 --> 00:31:56.980
And Doolittle was kind infected
with that idea, why should we think

00:31:56.980 --> 00:32:04.150
that prokaryotes were primitive
and disadvantaged, he reasoned,

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:07.380
perhaps introns had always
been present all the way back

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:12.420
to the last common ancestor and
had subsequently been streamlined

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:18.200
out of the prokaryotic
lineage, enabling them to adapt

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.090
in a different way
to their environment.

00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:26.050
So this became known as the
introns early theory, okay?

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:29.120
Well, Gilbert liked this idea.

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.450
It pushed exon shuffling
back earlier in evolution

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:38.320
than he'd thought, so he had to
relinquish the Cambrian explosion,

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:43.420
but shuffling and in return he
gained evolutionary primacy,

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.860
this was a fundamental
thing in evolution.

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.730
So that seemed a good tradeoff.

00:32:50.730 --> 00:32:57.610
And he wrote up this idea as a now
classic essay, why genes in pieces?

00:32:57.610 --> 00:33:00.740
This appeared in February of 1978

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:05.100
and Ford Doolittle's response
appeared two months later in April.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.560
In a conference paper
titled Playgrounds

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:13.350
of Evolution published the
next year Gilbert argued

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:18.040
that if exons were mini genes
then they ought to correspond

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:21.720
to functional protein
domains, right?

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.980
They ought to have made
functional things at one point

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.610
and if they were mixed and matched

00:33:27.610 --> 00:33:31.310
to put together more complex things
you ought to see them correspond

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.910
when you look at more
complicated proteins,

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:39.020
such as this immunoglobulin
molecule, okay?

00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.940
And so the pool of
exons and the genome

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:45.950
at any given time would
provide a set of Lego-like parts

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:50.280
from which evolution could
draw to make complex proteins.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.270
He concluded poetically that exons
were inserted into a background

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:58.900
of noncoding DNA, like bubbles
he wrote the exons float

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.460
on a sea of introns.

00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:06.490
In 1980 Gilbert received a
Nobel Prize for DNA sequencing.

00:34:06.490 --> 00:34:10.290
In his Nobel lecture he
talked about DNA sequencing,

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:11.590
but he also spent a lot

00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:15.040
of time discussing
evolution and exon shuffling.

00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:18.980
So clearly these ideas were
all linked in his mind.

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.610
Well, Doolittle began
to diverge from Gilbert.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:28.340
Evolution, he said, can't think
ahead and invent things in order

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.680
to speed future evolution, right?

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:36.020
In 1980, jumping off from
Richard Dawkin's argument

00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:42.610
that an organism is a gene's way of
making more genes, Doolittle said

00:34:42.610 --> 00:34:46.360
in essence, wait a second,
not all DNA is genes,

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.700
any DNA that replicates
itself ought to spread whether

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:52.890
or not it encodes a protein.

00:34:52.890 --> 00:34:56.530
This suggests that a lot of
DNA should merely be junk,

00:34:56.530 --> 00:35:00.550
and this is the origin of
the notion of junk DNA,

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:01.850
which you've probably heard.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:05.720
Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel
had roughly the same idea

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:10.660
at the same time, selfish DNA they
said could be considered parasitic

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.460
because it takes metabolic energy
to make and to maintain it,

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:19.670
so it should have some cost
to the organism, right?

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:24.310
And they published the ideas back
to back in the Journal Nature.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:31.180
It was on this background
- did I go forward, okay -

00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:36.050
it was on this background then
that catalytic RNA was discovered.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:42.350
In 1982 working with the
eukaryotic pond animal tetrahymena,

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:48.220
pictured here on the left, Tom
Cech at Colorado found an intron

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:55.280 position:56%
in a ribosomal RNA gene that spliced
itself out of the messenger RNA.

00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.650
It didn't require another
enzyme to come in

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:01.100
and cut it up, it could
just hop out.

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:07.230
The next year Sid Altman at Yale
published a paper on RNase P,

00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:12.440
which is an enzyme that has a
protein part and an RNA part,

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:18.660 position:56%
and what it does is snip off part
of the transfer RNA and activate it.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:24.790
And accidentally in a control
experiment he found that one

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:26.520
of his technicians actually found

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:31.800
that the RNA component alone
could catalyze that reaction,

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:35.270
and so this was a big surprise.

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.950
So we have two examples back
to back of catalytic RNA,

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:41.170
now we know that this
can actually happen.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:47.390
So these papers caused a sensation
accompanied by much speculation.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:54.000
And so in 1985 Norm Pace, another
member of the Carl Woese age,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.060
suggested that Cech's self-splicing
introns could be parasitic,

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:03.080
selfish transposons,
ala Crick and Doolittle.

00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:05.200
He also proposed an RNA world.

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:09.640
He suggested that originally RNA
could have served as both genotype

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.610
and phenotype, in other words,
as both gene and enzyme.

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:16.670
So this is an important idea
because it links this intron idea

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:22.720
and selfish DNA to the idea of
RNA as the original molecule.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.400
But Gilbert stuck to his guns,

00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:27.910
the same year he revisited
his exon theory of genes,

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:32.050
comparing it against the data
that had been gathered since 1978.

00:37:32.050 --> 00:37:38.500
In some cases the predictions
bore him out, in other cases not.

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:41.870
Ever the optimist he concluded
that the glass was half full,

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:46.500
the exon theory of genes, he
said, had held up rather well.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:51.270
This then is the context
for Gilbert's classic paper,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:55.250
which we can call The
RNA Only World.

00:37:55.250 --> 00:37:59.620
He opened the paper with the
recent discoveries of RNA splicing,

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:02.640
but they were several
years old by this time,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.190
why an editorial at this moment?

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:07.750
Because the paper was
as much about introns

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.970
as it was about RNA splicing.

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:14.430
Most people quote the deservedly
famous line from the paper,

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:20.440
one can contemplate an RNA world
containing only RNA molecules

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:25.040
that serve to catalyze the
synthesis of themselves.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:35.640
And this then is the
classical RNA world described

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:38.800
with Gilbert's characteristic
literary flare.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:43.290
But the paper also stated this
picture of the RNA world is one

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:46.900
of replicating molecules
that re-assort exons

00:38:46.900 --> 00:38:52.350
by transposable elements
created by introns, okay?

00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:55.460
So in a recent e-mail
Gilbert confirmed,

00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:59.960
my stress in the RNA world
paper, he said, was twofold.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.980
One was being struck with
the idea of RNA splicing,

00:39:02.980 --> 00:39:07.340
with the idea of RNA enzymes
doing everything, he said,

00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:12.230
and the second was the RNA based
exon shuffling of RNA pieces

00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:15.460
as a way of speeding up evolution.

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:20.840 position:56%
But the second idea would be written
out of the received narrative.

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:25.860 position:56%
Gilbert's paper led to a Cold Spring
Harbor Symposium the next year

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:30.050
in which one of our participants,
Stephen Bennett, participated.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.410
He may be hiding behind that tree

00:39:32.410 --> 00:39:35.310
or maybe that's his
shoulder, I'm not sure.

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:43.520
But a published volume followed in
1993 with later editions in 1999,

00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:50.210
2005, 2010, the RNA world
became a plurality of worlds

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:56.910 position:56%
as new research revealed many new
roles for RNA molecules in the cell.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:03.000
Today RNA world denotes a world
of contemporary physiology as much

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.210
as one of chemical evolution.

00:40:06.210 --> 00:40:08.400
RNA world became a mean.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.150
Here's an image taken from Carl
Zimmer's Science Tattoo Emporium,

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.910
in which a guy got a
tattoo of the RNA world,

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:19.590
except that he changed
the RNA to DNA

00:40:19.590 --> 00:40:24.470 position:56%
because he thought it looked better,
so the double helix looked cool.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:27.630
So here's an RNA world
with no RNA, okay?

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:34.310
And the received version of the
history of the RNA world began

00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:38.000
to crystalize within the scientific
community, roughly the one

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.640
with which I began, the
chicken-and-egg thing, okay?

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.720
This quote from Crick and Orgel

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:48.960
in 1993 represents an
act of myth making.

00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:52.710 position:56%
You can see all the elements of that
first RNA world that I described

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:54.240
to you at the beginning here.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:58.740
The RNA world, he said, they called
retrospectively the most important

00:40:58.740 --> 00:41:04.840
novel concept relevant
to our papers of 1968.

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:08.270 position:56%
We were thinking about it, you know,
it's just we didn't have a name yet.

00:41:08.270 --> 00:41:11.020
That he goes straight
to Cech and Altman,

00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.550
he talks about specific
catalysts made of RNA,

00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:19.300
not about exon shuffling,
and the key idea

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:23.760
of being a biochemistry
based on RNA alone.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:30.710
All right, I'm not calling them out
as doing something really unusual.

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.250
This kind of thing
shouldn't be surprising.

00:41:33.250 --> 00:41:37.530
Internal histories almost
always work this way, okay?

00:41:37.530 --> 00:41:40.870
Workers in the field make tacit
decisions about what counts

00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:47.940
as being worth passing down
to students, what and who does

00:41:47.940 --> 00:41:50.700
and does not deserve
credit and so forth.

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:55.070
So my point here, though, is
that nif making has consequences.

00:41:55.070 --> 00:42:01.730
There's a politics and a culture
to which stories are called true.

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:07.200
So I've shown you several RNA
worlds - the RNA protein world,

00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:13.280
the selfish RNA world, the RNA only
world, and a constructed RNA world.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.910
All of them are real and
all of them are imagined.

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:23.560
It's incontrovertible that RNA lies
at the heart of many fundamental

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:27.740
and ancient biological
processes, and it's nearly certain

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.940
that RNA preceded DNA in evolution.

00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:36.390
But beyond that these are models,
right, they can guide experiments

00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:38.020
but they can never be proven.

00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.770
That makes them incredibly
interesting

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:41.940
as a historical topic, right?

00:42:41.940 --> 00:42:49.140
The plurality of worlds may be,
in fact, not a flaw but a virtue.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.980
The power of the RNA world may
lie precisely in its ambiguity,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:57.010
in its existence as a
kind of virtual reality

00:42:57.010 --> 00:43:00.910
in which we all see
what we want to see.

more than one

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:40.180
of those worlds exist
at the same time?

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.590
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Let's see, in what sense?

00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:47.350
I mean there either
was protein, either RNA

00:43:47.350 --> 00:43:53.170
and protein evolved simultaneously
or they didn't, right?

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:56.900
So which ones would you
think could be simultaneous?

00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:00.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Well, it's a big world and things
could happen in different places

00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:07.970
and in different orders, making
the world much more complex

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:09.580
than we would like.

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.890
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Yes, absolutely right.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:15.090 position:56%

wait a minute, why is it only one?

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.480
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Right, right, right.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:22.020
I didn't mean to imply that
there need be only one.

00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:25.330
These are different models.

00:44:25.330 --> 00:44:31.900
What I've found in the field
is that people glom onto one

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:36.350
and they defend it,
you know, vigorously.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:38.850
Yes, fiercely in many cases.

00:44:38.850 --> 00:44:46.560
But, of course, there's no reason
to suspect that at some point

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:51.460
in one privileged part of the
ocean a single cell drifted

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:53.910
up to the surface and
began photosynthesizing.

00:44:53.910 --> 00:45:02.750
You know, it could have - many
people line-up with Matt Schrenk

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:09.090 position:56%
and think that deep sea hydrothermal
vents are a very logical place

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:12.700
for life to have begun,
but those existed in lots

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:16.840
of different conditions, and there
are still people arguing that, no,

00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:24.220
life probably emerged on
land in ponds that evaporated

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.850
and had repeated cycles
of drying and wetting.

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:32.030
The vent people say, yes,
there wasn't any land yet,

00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:34.780
but that's a whole separate debate.

00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:40.690
So, yes, you're right, in that
sense it's theoretically possible

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:47.950
that you could have an RNA only
world in one system and somewhere

00:45:47.950 --> 00:45:54.280
around the globe maybe protein
evolves at the same time.

00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:56.510
Yes, David, and then ...

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:07.550
&gt;&gt; I was in my mind thinking a
question and debating whether

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:20.480
to ask it, but it strikes
me that it's closely related

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:25.620
in an interesting way possibly
to the previous question.

00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:31.020 position:56%
I was wondering about how
deterministic this might be in terms

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:34.220
of being an astrobiologist,
thinking about other planets

00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:38.950
and the process you're describing
might we expect something analogous

00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:42.060
or even identical on other worlds?

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:44.220
If it's not so deterministic

00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:50.150
and it could happen different
ways then it strikes me

00:46:50.150 --> 00:46:56.610
that the previous question is
relevant, that it could happen

00:46:56.610 --> 00:47:00.790
in different ways in different
locations on the earth.

00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:02.090
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes.

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:04.740
&gt;&gt; And possibly the interaction
between what's happening

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:08.560
in similar nearby environments
could complicate the picture,

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:13.620
there may not be one linear
progression in one place,

00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:19.340
the geography of difference
could even become a part of this.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:20.640
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: That's great.

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:23.240
That's a really good point.

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.590
And I would say that's an example
of why the history matters, right?

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:25.890
If we accept the received version

00:47:25.890 --> 00:47:27.450 position:56%
of the history then we think there's
only one RNA world, but if we look

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.010
at the way the scientists were
thinking and writing and talking

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:30.310
and who were the different
allegiances and groups

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:31.830
that were debating and what the
real stakes were then we're kind

00:47:31.830 --> 00:47:33.130
of freed up intellectually.

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.430
We can think about
different kinds of RNA world

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:35.730
and maybe there's one
RNA world on one world

00:47:35.730 --> 00:47:37.030
and another RNA world
on another world, right?

received history having stakes

00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.630
and why that matters
to uncover them.

world implies replication,

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:54.220
so it means that there should
have been double-stranded RNA,

so that, too, was not wrong.

you're absolutely right,

going to ask that question.

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:08.300
I think Carl will back me up and
say that the caption from the guy

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:12.620
with the tattoo said that
he substituted DNA for RNA

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:13.920

he made himself unnecessarily
look a little bit like a doofus.

00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.970
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Separate question, okay.

00:48:37.970 --> 00:48:39.480
Mary?

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:40.780
&gt;&gt; So I have two things.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.080
One is I think most

00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:45.540
of the astrobiology community
is leaning towards the idea

00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.600 position:56%
that life probably arose many
times, which is consistent with lots

00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:53.110 position:56%
of different RNA worlds potentially,
and that what we are observing here

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.740
on earth at this moment is
the linear [Assumed Spelling].

00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:57.040
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Right, yes.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.930
&gt;&gt; So rewinding I'm sure you'd
see a lot of possibilities.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:03.990
The other thing I would say
that is a challenge I think

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:07.390 position:56%
for the metabolism first people and,
Matt, maybe I should have asked you,

00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:09.430 position:56%
I'll ask you again wherever you are.

00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:10.730
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Matt is right over here.

00:49:10.730 --> 00:49:12.030
&gt;&gt; There you are.

00:49:12.030 --> 00:49:14.770
Is that I don't know
that we actually know

00:49:14.770 --> 00:49:20.520
when plate tectonics was initiated
and was pervasive on the planet

00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.400
and hydrothermal vents are largely
driven by those sorts of activity,

00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.670
so they may have been
late to the game, as well.

00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:31.040
And so and maybe after
we had continents.

00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:35.310
I mean a lot of this the geologic
history of earth becomes sort

00:49:35.310 --> 00:49:39.740 position:56%
of complicating in the whole picture
of how, what the origins were.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.960
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Yes, thank you for that.

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:48.040
One of the many mind-blowing
things that has happened

00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.230
to be me this year was a few
weeks ago when you hooked me

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:56.610
up with Penny Boston
[Assumed Spelling],

00:49:56.610 --> 00:50:02.150
the new head of the National
Astrobiology Institute.

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:09.820
And she is a geologist who goes
down in caves, and she told me -

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:17.520
she spun this whole model of the
amazing bacterial and archaeal life

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.840 position:56%
down in, way down deep in the crust,

00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.200
even possibly into the
mantle of the earth.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:31.240
And said that a lot of that could
have predated plate tectonics,

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:36.280
and some of those organisms
might have been shifting

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.660
around with the tectonic plates.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:45.650
And that means that life possibly
could have even predated the late

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:46.950
heavy bombardment.

00:50:46.950 --> 00:50:49.500
I mean so we could be
pushed back even before

00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:52.460
that 3.7 billion years, right?

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:57.620
So she has this remarkable vision
of not - we're used to thinking

00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:01.410
of the world as a big
rock clothed with life,

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:11.710
and her concept is an integrated
mineral, biogeological system,

00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:15.170
that rock and life are
inherently integrated.

00:51:15.170 --> 00:51:20.340
And think about that, if a little
drop of sweat occurs on your brow

00:51:20.340 --> 00:51:23.670
in here, what's in it,
salt, minerals, right?

00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:28.370 position:56%
So we're constantly, life is flowing
through rock and rock is flowing

00:51:28.370 --> 00:51:30.440
through life constantly, right?

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:34.480
So, yes. So I told her, yes.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.620
So we finished the
conversation by my saying,

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.920
can I come down in a cave?

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.220
And she said, sure.

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:42.080
So, you know, I can't wait.

00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:44.480
Any more? Carl had one?

00:51:52.050 --> 00:51:56.070
&gt;&gt; I am just curious
sort of historically,

00:51:56.070 --> 00:52:00.300
like as you've been looking at the
RNA world as it was being explored,

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:04.460 position:56%
described and so on in its different
forms, how much were people thinking

00:52:04.460 --> 00:52:12.720
of it as an investigation of the
origin of life versus a transition

00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:17.470
with something before it,
then you go to RNA life,

00:52:17.470 --> 00:52:21.450
and then you get to
RNA-DNA protein life?

00:52:21.450 --> 00:52:24.460
I'm sort of wondering because you
showed the feathered dinosaur,

00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:26.730
you know, and that's a
great transitional form

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.340
and there you're just sort
of wondering like, okay,

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.160
how did birds get in
the air with feathers?

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.460
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Right.

00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.760
&gt;&gt; And then you look
at those dinosaurs.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.060
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Right.

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:38.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; And so the RNA world in that
case might be this transitional form

00:52:38.190 --> 00:52:43.260
and maybe you got something else
before it, maybe some molecules,

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.970
like PNA or something, that
aren't even around anymore.

00:52:45.970 --> 00:52:47.270
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Right.

00:52:47.270 --> 00:52:49.850
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious like when the
people were historically developing

00:52:49.850 --> 00:52:53.970
the idea of the RNA world
how were they framing it?

00:52:53.970 --> 00:52:56.230
Were they saying like we
go from nothing to RNA

00:52:56.230 --> 00:52:58.360
or were they saying
something and then RNA

00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.860
and that addresses this
basic transition question?

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:03.320
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Right, okay.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:04.620
&gt;&gt; Magic.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.920
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Someone with magic, yes.

00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:10.850
One of the things that interests
me about the RNA world is

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:14.650
that it is precisely at
that transitional place.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:19.890 position:56%
And you have one group of scientists
who tend to work downward,

00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:22.440
working down the phylogenetic
tree back

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.400
to the last universal
common ancestor and trying

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.470 position:56%
to drive back down to the RNA world.

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:31.100
You have another group who
are coming up from the geology

00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.260
and basically trying to make
life out of rocks and seawater.

00:53:35.260 --> 00:53:39.130
And the RNA world sits right in the
middle there, and some people think

00:53:39.130 --> 00:53:41.810
that that would be life
and some people think

00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:45.510
that that's a pre-proto life.

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:51.060
Originally, the first people,
like Crick and Orgel and Gilbert,

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:54.640
had a pretty - as I said, they're
basically practicing evolution

00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:59.190
without a license, and so they
had a pretty simplistic kind

00:53:59.190 --> 00:54:04.300
of primordial soup notion that
there would just be this pool

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:10.650
of nucleotides floating around that
would gather together into strands

00:54:10.650 --> 00:54:12.140
of RNA that would replicate,

00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:16.360
and then there would be some amino
acids floating around in the pool

00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:18.980
and they would somehow
glom onto them, right?

00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:20.820
So they didn't really
think about that.

00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.880
And one of the really exciting
things to me this year was to get

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:29.160
to talk to and read a whole
bunch about the people

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.690
who were working bottom-up, right?

00:54:31.690 --> 00:54:35.070
And it's too bad that Jim Cleaves
isn't here because he thinks

00:54:35.070 --> 00:54:39.520 position:56%
of himself as going sideways,
coming at it from a different angle.

00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:48.330 position:56%
But that's one of the things that
has come out of the last few decades

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:52.620
of origin of life research, that
this really is an area where,

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:57.210
you know - and this is why the
ambiguity I think is valuable

00:54:57.210 --> 00:55:01.640
because you can toss around a term
like RNA world and everybody kind

00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:04.780
of knows what you mean, and so
you say we're trying to get,

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:09.260
ideally we'd like to
get from dinucleotides

00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:17.310
and the reverse TCA cycle up to
the RNA world, whatever that is.

00:55:17.310 --> 00:55:19.600
And other people would say,
you know, well, this could lead

00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.440
down to eventually the RNA
world, and those people can talk

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:28.660
to each other because there's
enough slippage in the term

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:29.960
that it enables people

00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.730
with different languages
to speak to each other.

00:55:32.730 --> 00:55:36.530
Yes, okay, I think with
that I will leave it.

00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:39.170
We'll have more time for a
general discussion afterward,

00:55:39.170 --> 00:55:42.680
but I don't want to take
any time away from Matt.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.510
Thank you.

00:55:54.410 --> 00:55:55.710
Thank you.

00:55:55.710 --> 00:55:58.050
All right, well, first
off, it's a real honor

00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.350
and a privilege to be speaking.

00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.180
And I'll thank you and you
Nathaniel for inviting me

00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:04.160
into the Kluge Center
for hosting this event.

00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:06.730
I'm really excited not only
to tell you about the research

00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:11.770
that my lab group conducts and the
places we've been, but also to hear

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:15.340
from the range of different studies
that are being conducted by people

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:19.180
in this room and the vast amount
of knowledge related to this topic

00:56:19.180 --> 00:56:22.150
that they bring to the table.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:27.450
So my group at Michigan State
studies modern microorganisms

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:28.930
in extreme environments.

00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:32.140
Many of these are geothermal
systems, hot environments,

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.160
at the bottom of the ocean
and associated with volcanoes.

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:40.600 position:56%
Some of the sponsors of our work
include NASA Astrobiology Institute,

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:43.930
as well as the Deep
Carbon Observatory

00:56:43.930 --> 00:56:45.750 position:56%
and the Alfred P. Sloane Foundation.

00:56:45.750 --> 00:56:50.620
And so we look at this
interface between geological

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:54.110
and biological processes
in modern systems.

00:56:54.110 --> 00:56:55.680
Let's see, all right.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:57:03.720
So I'm going to provide a
little bit of context related

00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.110
to the early earth environment
and origins of life theories

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:10.760
because I wasn't sure
exactly what some

00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.020
of the other speakers
were covering today.

00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:16.380 position:56%
But really I wanted to get into some
of the insights we have from looking

00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:20.700
at these modern systems, describing
what these systems are all

00:57:20.700 --> 00:57:24.200
about first and foremost and
then subsequently what are some

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:27.800
of the characteristics of the
geomicrobiology in these systems

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.730
and how they might stimulate future
directions to consider in origins

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:36.300
of life research, both from the
bottom-up and top-down sorts

00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:38.710
of approaches or perhaps
even sideways approaches

00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:41.440
if you can imagine that.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:45.340
So, as Nathaniel said earlier, the
warm little pond is at the window,

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:50.130
but just to point out and put this

00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:57.580 position:56%
into context it's the ideas dating
back to Darwin and even further back

00:57:57.580 --> 00:58:02.590
to Pasteur and others, thinking
about organosynthesis reactions,

00:58:02.590 --> 00:58:07.320
these warm little ponds
stimulated by heat or electricity

00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:10.650
or light originating some
of the first biomolecules

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:13.250
and subsequently the
first organisms.

00:58:13.250 --> 00:58:17.380
Thereby serving as
inspiration for experiments

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:20.550
like the Miller-Urey
synthesis experiment in 1953,

00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:25.590
where they took water in a highly
reducing atmosphere with things

00:58:25.590 --> 00:58:30.260
like methane and hydrogen
and ammonia and create,

00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:32.100
used a spark discharge
to generate some

00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:37.500
of the first abiologically
produced amino acids at that point.

00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:43.610
Now it turns out that that system
was a whole lot more complicated

00:58:43.610 --> 00:58:46.670
than the initial experiment
suggested

00:58:46.670 --> 00:58:51.300
that perhaps the early atmosphere
was not as reduced, for example,

00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:55.350
as the Urey experiment, but it
really stimulated a long line

00:58:55.350 --> 00:58:59.570
of experimental research
into the possibilities

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:02.010
for organosynthesis reactions.

00:59:02.010 --> 00:59:04.600
And whether you think
the conditions were right

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.030
or not it's become apparent over
the years through explorations

00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:13.440
of the solar system and the
organic matter contained

00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:16.490
within these objects
within our solar system

00:59:16.490 --> 00:59:22.470
that organosynthesis reactions
occur and are widespread in space.

00:59:22.470 --> 00:59:26.370
For example, in the
atmosphere of some

00:59:26.370 --> 00:59:28.690
of these icy moves [Assumed
Spelling], such as Titan,

00:59:28.690 --> 00:59:34.140
you have UV stimulated
radiation of simple molecules,

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:41.560
of small molecules, synthesis
reactions continuing on

00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:45.180
and thereby creating more and
more complex organic molecules.

00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:49.760
Also, through the exploration
of meteorites and comets

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.290
and the very high levels
of these materials

00:59:54.290 --> 01:00:00.170
that were hitting the earth during
the Hadean period, all these,

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:03.670
in particular the carbonaceous
chondrites are very organic-rich,

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:07.600
so they contain a range of
organic compounds, you know,

01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:12.580
macromolecular carbon can comprise
70% to 80% of the total carbon,

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:16.590
for example, in these materials and
they contain a range of compounds,

01:00:16.590 --> 01:00:20.360
including amino acids,
aromatics, purines and pyrimidines.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.570
So some of these building blocks
of these larger organic molecules

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:28.210
that we've been talking about.

01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:33.340
So, and then my favorite
topic, the hydrothermal events,

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:35.500
so these are areas associated

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:40.720
with primarily magnetic
upwelling in the earth.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.820
They serve to drive
the input of seawater

01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:46.410
and hydrothermal circulation
up to 65 millions

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:48.780
of years away from the ridge axis.

01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:51.090
They were first discovered
in the late 1970s

01:00:51.090 --> 01:00:53.870
and they've really revolutionized
many areas of science,

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:57.220
including microbiology
and our understanding

01:00:57.220 --> 01:01:00.980
of evolutionary biology and
biodiversity on this planet.

01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:04.300
Some of the most apparent
life forms there are things

01:01:04.300 --> 01:01:07.550
like the giant tubeworms, shown
on the right-hand side here,

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:12.240
but there's underlying this there's
a rich diversity of microbial life

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.910
in these systems, as well.

01:01:14.910 --> 01:01:20.470
So these systems have very steep
gradients in both temperature

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:22.310
and chemistry associated with them.

01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:26.140
As the cool oxidized seawater,
at least in the modern day earth,

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:28.860
percolates through the
subsurface, it's heated up,

01:01:28.860 --> 01:01:32.620
reacts with subsurface rocks and
then is vented onto the sea floor,

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:38.140
containing high temperature
fluids up to 407 degrees Celsius,

01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.990
rich in dissolved metals,
and also shows the potential

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:46.270
for abiogenic synthesis, okay?

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.640
So there were numerous sources
of heat on the Hadean earth,

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:53.170
heat from accretion,
radiolytic decay and energy

01:01:53.170 --> 01:01:54.810
from meteoritic impacts

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:57.700
that potentially drive
hydrothermal circulation.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:01.400
These systems are rich in
catalytic mineral surfaces.

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:05.560
These systems are generally
made of metal sulfide materials.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.070
And perhaps with all
this bombardment

01:02:08.070 --> 01:02:11.690
and this very harsh surface
environment perhaps subsurface

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.520
environments associated with
these systems protected proto life

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.910
and even some of the
early molecular reactions

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:23.220
from the damaging affects
of all these impacts.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.370
And nowadays there's evidence

01:02:25.370 --> 01:02:28.280
for a prolific abiogenic
organosynthesis reactions,

01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.870
abiogenetically produced
organic molecules,

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:34.470
particularly at ultramafic-hosted
hydrothermal vents.

01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:40.510
These are rocks that are more
reducing, commonly characteristic

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:42.860
of deeper portions of the
earth, such as the mantle,

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:47.350
that stimulate the production of
high concentrations of hydrogen,

01:02:47.350 --> 01:02:51.670
as well as abiogenic
small organic molecules.

01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:56.890
So my point was not to
focus on any one of these,

01:02:56.890 --> 01:03:00.070
not even on deep-sea
hydrothermal vents in particular.

01:03:00.070 --> 01:03:02.800
The point is that there
are many different sources

01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:06.980
of organic molecules likely to
have occurred on the early earth

01:03:06.980 --> 01:03:15.740
and all these likely played
some role in this system.

01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:19.820 position:56%
Additionally, you know, as Nathaniel
talked about quite a bit in his talk

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:22.890
as well or at least the RNA
world component of this,

01:03:22.890 --> 01:03:26.410
there are several problems we need
to solve when it comes to going

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:30.640
from these abiotic organosynthesis
reactions to the first cells

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:34.750
or the first things we could
recognize as living organisms.

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:38.790
The extent to which we need
membranes to encapsulate

01:03:38.790 --> 01:03:41.850
and protect some of these early
biomolecules and reactions

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.450 position:56%
and the order in which that occurred

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:46.590
and the whole chicken-and-egg
scenario.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:52.590
Our ability to catalyze larger
and more complex molecules

01:03:52.590 --> 01:03:56.730
under appropriate chemistries,
it's a continual work in progress

01:03:56.730 --> 01:04:02.160
in terms of making things that
are more functional and productive

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:06.240
in terms of the relationship
to the first cells.

01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:08.480
And then thinking about
how these properties,

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:11.520
how these success stories
are then inherited

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:14.820
and these emergent properties
propagate through the system

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:19.200
and are stored in information
storage, whether those are

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.890
in minerals, DNA, RNA
or other molecules.

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:26.820
So we're still a long ways from
the first functioning protocells.

01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:30.670
We still have a lot of work
to do to connect the dots

01:04:30.670 --> 01:04:34.810 position:56%
from the bottom-up and the top-down.

01:04:34.810 --> 01:04:39.410
But what I do think is important
is I think, and I forget which one

01:04:39.410 --> 01:04:41.900
of the people in the audience
asked this, I think it was David,

01:04:41.900 --> 01:04:45.180
about the complexity of
these natural systems.

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.840
It's likely that there was not just
one location for these reactions

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.480
to be occurring, it's likely

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:53.670
that they were all
occurring simultaneously

01:04:53.670 --> 01:04:57.520
or perhaps there is some sort
of temporal aspect, as well,

01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.120
but there's complexity
in the environment,

01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:04.690
it's not just a warm little pond
or a beaker full of chemicals,

01:05:04.690 --> 01:05:09.350
it's a moving dynamic system moving

01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:11.590
through space and moving
through time.

01:05:11.590 --> 01:05:15.080
As my Ph.D. advisor has put it,
John Barose [Assumed Spelling],

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:18.260
for a number of years,
original life probably occurred

01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:23.180
as a one-kilometer cell connecting
many different environments.

01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:27.370
So people, like Mike Russell,
have taken this and developed

01:05:27.370 --> 01:05:31.950
and articulated models
connecting some of these thermal

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:36.380
and chemical gradients and how
they might drive the synthesis

01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:38.970
of organic molecules and
some of the first cells,

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:45.880
some of the first things
resembling protocells.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.650
Using the natural physical
and chemical characteristics

01:05:48.650 --> 01:05:52.780
of environments, like hydrothermal
vent chimneys, as templates

01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:57.730
or analogs for some of
these reactions to occur.

01:05:57.730 --> 01:06:02.770
John Barose's group, with
the lead Author Eva Stueken,

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:06.510
put out this really nice paper a
few years ago in geobiology sort

01:06:06.510 --> 01:06:09.940
of tying together not just at
the hydrothermal vent scale

01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:13.050
but at the global scale
how earth could serve

01:06:13.050 --> 01:06:16.600
as a global chemical reactor
providing different catalysts

01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:19.050
and different reaction
conditions as part

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:22.230
of a dynamic system
encompassing many

01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:25.750
of the different inputs we've
talked about already - meteorites,

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.770
atmospheric chemistry
and hydrothermalism.

01:06:28.770 --> 01:06:31.450
So the world is complex,
it's complex now,

01:06:31.450 --> 01:06:35.430
and it was complex back four
billion year ago, as well.

01:06:35.430 --> 01:06:39.070
And I think we need to take
this complexity and diversity

01:06:39.070 --> 01:06:43.050
into account rather than being
pigeonholed into a particular type

01:06:43.050 --> 01:06:48.830
of reaction or region
where it can occur.

01:06:48.830 --> 01:06:52.210
So, as I mentioned, the
ancient earth was complex,

01:06:52.210 --> 01:06:53.650
but so is the modern earth.

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:57.850
This is an example of a
heavily serpentinized rock,

01:06:57.850 --> 01:06:59.570
a water rock reaction.

01:06:59.570 --> 01:07:02.890
The microbes, this is
a common sort of system

01:07:02.890 --> 01:07:07.270 position:56%
that my laboratory studies, one type
of system where water is flowing

01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:09.480
through subsurface materials.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:17.020
All this mosaic and mosaic fracture
network here are the habitats

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:20.320
in which microorganisms
and these systems occur.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:27.890
But I'm not an organic chemist,
I'm not a paleontologist or any

01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:31.580
of these things, my laboratory
studies environmental biology.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.590
We get out in the field, we go

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:35.640
to extreme environments
and we collect samples.

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.220
We try to figure out how
the microbes are operating,

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:41.170
how they survive these
conditions, how they interact

01:07:41.170 --> 01:07:44.510
with the geochemical and
physical environments.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:50.180 position:56%
And then if there are clues within
these systems that tell us something

01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:55.720
as analogs to earlier conditions,
you know, I think they can be used

01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:00.030
to inform some of these
bottom-up types of approaches.

01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:02.900
But the other thing that
I haven't heard mentioned

01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:06.640 position:56%
yet that I think is really valuable
about these types of environments is

01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:08.590
that these are systems
on the modern day earth

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:12.610
where you have this interface
of abiotic and biotic processes.

01:08:12.610 --> 01:08:16.580
As you drill down deeper into
the earth you cross some divide

01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.430
or you're likely to
cross some divide.

01:08:18.430 --> 01:08:21.040
We haven't reached
it yet in some cases,

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:26.360
between abiotic carbon cycling
and the biosphere, right?

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:28.940
And we need to study
these systems carefully

01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.160
and understand how organisms

01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:34.680
in these systems might use
these abiotic compounds and how

01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:38.640
to define the properties of
living and nonliving systems.

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:42.340
So the point is I think the
environments I'm going to describe

01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:47.220
in just a second here have
values not just as analogs

01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:52.680
for early earth type of conditions,
but also as observatories,

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:57.500
places to look to better understand
the relationship between living

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.740
and nonliving parts of the earth.

01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.570
So one of our favorite types

01:09:01.570 --> 01:09:04.340
of systems is the deep-sea
hydrothermal vents.

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.980
Here's a typical example
of that here.

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:10.200
These are places in the
middle of the ocean.

01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.890 position:56%
There's 65,000 kilometers along the
ocean ridge spreading center network

01:09:14.890 --> 01:09:19.820
on the planet right now
where seawater percolates

01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.860
through the subsurface, reacts
with the rock, and then is vented

01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:27.730
out through these hydrothermal vent
chimneys known as black smokers.

01:09:27.730 --> 01:09:31.510
Within the subsurface and within
the walls of these chimneys,

01:09:31.510 --> 01:09:35.990
which can be tens of
meters off of the sea floor,

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:40.850
you have really steep gradients
in temperature and chemistry

01:09:40.850 --> 01:09:45.850
between the 300 plus degrees
Celsius hydrothermal fluids

01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:47.560
and the 2 degrees Celsius seawater.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:54.180
These fluids are also very diverse
in terms of their chemistry.

01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:57.780
The hydrothermal fluid
is full of metals,

01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:01.280
which make this the black smoke
that's coming out of the chimney,

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:08.880
whereas, the seawater is largely
oxic and has a variety of compounds

01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:13.870
that can be used potentially
to oxidize or respire some

01:10:13.870 --> 01:10:18.830
of these components coming out
of the hydrothermal fluids.

01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:22.050
Just a few years ago or now it's
been more than a few years ago,

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:23.740
but back in 2000 a new type

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.570
of hydrothermal system was
discovered called the Lost City

01:10:27.570 --> 01:10:29.660
hydrothermal field.

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:33.820
This was discovered near the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge by a group

01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:36.320
of researchers at the
University of Washington,

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:39.420
and the differences
here are that instead

01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.350
of having very high temperature
hydrothermal fluids coming

01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:44.760
out that are very acidic
and metal rich,

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:49.570
here you have fluids influenced by
a process called serpetinization,

01:10:49.570 --> 01:10:51.870
which are very high pH and rich,

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:55.340
even higher concentrations
of methane and hydrogen.

01:10:55.340 --> 01:10:58.590
So these are a completely
different sort of chemistry

01:10:58.590 --> 01:11:04.440
than you typically see at the black
smoker type of magnetic systems.

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.990
More moderate temperatures
in the sense,

01:11:06.990 --> 01:11:10.460
and typically where these
things occur are not places

01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:13.700
where magnetic activity
occurs, but these are associated

01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:20.490
with commonly tectonic activity,
earthquakes, that offset the plates

01:11:20.490 --> 01:11:23.520
from one another and
allow fluids to circulate.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:28.600
And then a third type of system we
work at are subaerial volcanoes.

01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:31.400
So, in particular, we
look at microbes that live

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.110
within these volcanic
fumaroles and try

01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:37.020
to study how they're using
all this gas that's coming

01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:38.440
out of these fumaroles.

01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:42.260
These gases can include
hydrogen, sulfur compounds,

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.910
things that you might
see in sketches

01:11:44.910 --> 01:11:47.480
of what the early earth
might look like.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:49.370
these things are occurring
right now in places

01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:52.830
like Komatke [Assumed Spelling] in
Siberia And the Aleutian Islands

01:11:52.830 --> 01:11:56.380
and all along the ring of
fire, really, in the Pacific.

01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:59.620
So here you have materials
that accumulates

01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.150
on the ocean floor then subducted
back into the earth and some

01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:06.960
of this sways back out through
these extreme environments found

01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.520
in subaerial volcanoes.

01:12:10.710 --> 01:12:13.810
So I just want to make a
couple points about our studies

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:15.110
of these sorts of systems.

01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:19.590
The first of which is organisms
in these systems don't grow

01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:25.140
in your typical flask or beaker
full of material, they don't grow

01:12:25.140 --> 01:12:27.430
in a liquid phase commonly.

01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:29.820
These systems are dynamic systems.

01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:33.230
If Nathaniel showed you
some pictures of his trip

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:37.460
to Yellowstone this summer he might
show you streamers and biofilms,

01:12:37.460 --> 01:12:39.880
slimy communities growing
in the outflow

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:42.320
from the hydrothermal pools there.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.820
The organisms in these systems
want to stay attached to surfaces,

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:50.530
they want to stay in
their happy place in terms

01:12:50.530 --> 01:12:52.590 position:56%
of these thermal-chemical gradients.

01:12:52.590 --> 01:12:56.760
And they grow attached to these
catalytic mineral surfaces,

01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:01.260
so many of the same surfaces
and minerals we evoke to serve

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:05.530
as catalysts in our abiogenic
synthesis reactions are also the

01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:07.820
substrates for microbes to grow on.

01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:12.750
So here's an example of microbes
that grew on the surface of a piece

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:15.230
of iron sulfide or pyrite mineral

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:17.320
that we stuck in a
hydrothermal vent.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:21.550
You can see they form colonies,
they divide, they disperse,

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:25.890
and they pattern themselves
all over this surface.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:31.260 position:56%
At the Lost City hydrothermal field
this serpetinization influenced high

01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:32.980
pH system.

01:13:32.980 --> 01:13:36.180
There's also interesting
insights from looking at biofilms.

01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:39.050
For example, when we go into
the hydrothermal chimneys

01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:45.140 position:56%
at the Lost City we see almost a
single species of biofilms comprised

01:13:45.140 --> 01:13:48.640
of archaea related to
methanogenic archaea

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.810
within these hydrothermal
vent chimneys.

01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:56.000
The picture on the upper right
here shows some of the polymers,

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.490
these polymeric matrix that
holds these cells together.

01:13:59.490 --> 01:14:00.910
In this sense it's dehydrated,

01:14:00.910 --> 01:14:03.520
but these organisms are
encapsulated together

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.540
in a bed of slime, more or less.

01:14:06.540 --> 01:14:11.620
This biofilms are held
together and attached

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:14.980
to the surfaces using polymers,
such as polysaccharides,

01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:17.460
which keep them in place.

01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:22.280
So the point of this is not only
do the organisms have some sort

01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:26.480
of very tightly coupled interaction
with the catalytic surfaces,

01:14:26.480 --> 01:14:29.770
but they grow as communities
in these polymers

01:14:29.770 --> 01:14:34.490 position:56%
and this polymeric matrix, this gel,
might serve some important roles

01:14:34.490 --> 01:14:38.590
in terms of thinking about how
different organosynthesis reactions

01:14:38.590 --> 01:14:42.830
may couple together to form
some of the first protocells.

01:14:43.930 --> 01:14:49.490 position:56%
They may also serve as templates for
minerals, especially nano particles

01:14:49.490 --> 01:14:55.870
and small scale minerals that may
also serve as catalysts to occur.

01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:58.620
So these charged biofilms,

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:03.410
these gel-like matrices can
instigate the precipitation

01:15:03.410 --> 01:15:04.930
of small minerals.

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:07.290
These minerals may serve
as more effective catalysts

01:15:07.290 --> 01:15:09.210
when dispersed throughout the film.

01:15:09.210 --> 01:15:14.350
So this is another part where even
the properties of the biofilm,

01:15:14.350 --> 01:15:17.040
itself, even if they aren't
cellular may serve a role

01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:21.450
in facilitating some of the
early prebiotic chemistry

01:15:21.450 --> 01:15:23.070
and organosynthesis reactions.

01:15:23.070 --> 01:15:27.540
So for one thing I would encourage
studying these small scale

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.850
properties and the role
of biofilms and polymers

01:15:29.850 --> 01:15:32.790
in origins of life research.

01:15:32.790 --> 01:15:36.160
The second thing is it's
very attractive to think

01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.630
about using these metal
sulfide catalysts

01:15:40.630 --> 01:15:42.940
or these different
metallic catalysts

01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.490
to drive organosynthesis reactions.

01:15:45.490 --> 01:15:49.610
We can show that simple
reactions occur fairly readily,

01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:52.560
especially as you heat them to
higher temperatures and put them

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:56.410
under pressure, such as the
carbonyl insertion reaction shown

01:15:56.410 --> 01:15:58.510
in the middle here.

01:15:58.510 --> 01:16:01.230
We can also go out to
hydrothermal systems,

01:16:01.230 --> 01:16:04.710
like the rainbow hydrothermal
field in the middle of the Atlantic

01:16:04.710 --> 01:16:08.400
which is a hybrid system
between the high temperature

01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.520
and the ultramafic
systems I've described

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.300
and find many different organic
molecules in the fluids coming

01:16:14.300 --> 01:16:18.440
out of these, which have isotopic
signatures and chemical signatures

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.510
to show that they are
not produced by biology.

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:26.420
So we have both observational
experimental sense

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.590
that abiotic organic
geochemistry is happening

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:32.090
at modern day hydrothermal vents.

01:16:32.090 --> 01:16:37.700
And it's attractive to look
at those data and then compare

01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:40.590
that to biochemical
pathways that we know about.

01:16:40.590 --> 01:16:44.690
For example, the reductive acetyl
CoA pathway and begin to plug

01:16:44.690 --> 01:16:47.270
and play with the different
mineral catalysts and think

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:51.900
about how the different steps may
be catalyzed through the reaction.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.990
But the reality of this and sort

01:16:53.990 --> 01:16:58.890
of building upon what I was
describing earlier about the divide

01:16:58.890 --> 01:17:02.970
between living and
nonliving systems are

01:17:02.970 --> 01:17:05.930
that the world is not that simple.

01:17:05.930 --> 01:17:08.340
There's overlapping carbon sources

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.210
and properties in all
of these systems.

01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:12.800
What we've found through
studies of deep earth materials

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:14.100
and of hydrothermal systems is

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:19.120
that organisms don't always use the
simplest molecules to metabolize,

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.920 position:56%
they don't always use the CO2 or the
hydrogen, sometimes they use some

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:27.160
of these simple organic compounds
produced by abiotic processes,

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.140 position:56%
sometimes they use the hydrocarbons,
the methane and other compounds.

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:34.740
And so it's not always so
clear as to what's biotic

01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:36.420
and abiotic in these systems.

01:17:36.420 --> 01:17:38.180
Certainly interesting
to think about in terms

01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:40.860
of astrobiological
exploration, right?

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:42.930
We'd like to know,
study these systems

01:17:42.930 --> 01:17:47.360
and understand what's evidence
of life and what's not.

01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:50.550
But as for exploring deeper parts

01:17:50.550 --> 01:17:56.270
of the earth's biosphere right
now it's sometimes difficult to go

01:17:56.270 --> 01:18:00.070
from a very simple
explanation like this

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:03.020 position:56%
to the complexity of the real world.

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.570 position:56%
So, again, I would encourage
studies of these analog type systems

01:18:07.570 --> 01:18:11.760
in order to help us better
define the properties of abiotic

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:14.790
and biological carbon
compounds in these systems.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.420
And then we haven't even gotten
into the fact that we're covered

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:20.270
with life on the surface and
that complicates everything,

01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:21.930
it eats a lot of carbon
that's produced

01:18:21.930 --> 01:18:27.310 position:56%
and just makes it a big mess, right?

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:32.690
And then, thirdly, I want to talk
about we've had this in biology,

01:18:32.690 --> 01:18:37.530
we've had this genomics revolution
over the past 20 years or so,

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:44.030
where nowadays we don't have to
deal with radioactive phosphorous

01:18:44.030 --> 01:18:46.930
in terms of our sequencing,
like Maxam and Gilbert

01:18:46.930 --> 01:18:49.090
and Sanger did in those days.

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:52.290
Nowadays we can just send
samples off on a plate

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:56.740
and have results overnight
or in very short order.

01:18:56.740 --> 01:19:01.940
Many orders of magnitude, more
at DNA sequences than we used to.

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:05.810
Nowadays we're drowning
in data in many cases.

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:10.720
So this has really enabled us to
look at biology in a whole new way.

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.020
So an example of this
the really exciting paper

01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:15.630
that was published just this summer

01:19:15.630 --> 01:19:17.660
by Bill Martin's group
over in Germany.

01:19:17.660 --> 01:19:21.300
Many of you have probably seen
something like this tree of life

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:25.420
in the upper right here, thinking
about the lineages of bacteria

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:29.750
and eukarya and archaea and how
they might have some last universal

01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:32.790 position:56%
common ancestry may have been shared
amongst these different lineages

01:19:32.790 --> 01:19:37.400
and thinking about what that
last common ancestor was

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:38.700
and where it originated.

01:19:38.700 --> 01:19:42.960
Many of these trees traditionally
have been built upon just a few

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:48.360
genes, primarily the small subunit
ribosomal RNA gene or 16S gene

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:50.060
that you may have heard about.

01:19:50.060 --> 01:19:53.210
But this genomics revolution
I talked about has enabled us

01:19:53.210 --> 01:19:57.350
to look not just at individual
genes, but across whole genomes

01:19:57.350 --> 01:20:02.260
or bacterial chromosomes
to look at the properties

01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:06.850
of not just the ribosomal RNA
gene but any sort of function

01:20:06.850 --> 01:20:08.830
of phenotype that we
have some knowledge of.

01:20:08.830 --> 01:20:14.650
So Martin's group looked at over
2,000 different prokaryotic genomes

01:20:14.650 --> 01:20:17.070
from the sequencing
analyses and boiled it

01:20:17.070 --> 01:20:19.950
down to 355 protein families

01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:23.890
that were shared amongst multiple
lineages across the tree of life.

01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:28.140
And what they found out was
that they found some clues

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:32.280
to the metabolic and
physiological properties of some

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:35.840
that were likely shared by the
last universal common ancestor

01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.520 position:56%
and that leuka was probably an
anaerobic thermophile likely related

01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.940
to cluster of the LEs [Assumed
Spelling] or methanogens

01:20:42.940 --> 01:20:46.150
and that things like
hydrogen, nitrogen

01:20:46.150 --> 01:20:50.030
and carbon monoxide were all
important in its metabolism.

01:20:50.030 --> 01:20:51.550
So some of these things
sound familiar

01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:52.900
with what we've already described,

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:55.440
places like the Lost
City hydrothermal field

01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:00.630
or deep-sea vents, so it's very
encouraging that these sort

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:03.060
of data were able to fall
out of this very complicated

01:21:03.060 --> 01:21:06.840
and thorough analyses
that they conducted.

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:14.040
And but what Martin's group worked
with was only a fraction of what is

01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:20.070
out there on the planet, so there's
long been this significant disjoint

01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:22.870
between what we can obtain
and domesticate in the lab,

01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:26.120
what we can culture, and what we
know exists in the environment.

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:30.580
Typically we're only able to
cultivate a very small percentage

01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:32.200
of all the organisms
out there in nature,

01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:35.450
particularly in extreme
environments that are not usually

01:21:35.450 --> 01:21:40.580
on the radar of, say, medical
microbiologists, for example.

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:45.340
So we have a very small subset of
the organisms nature and culture

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:49.170
from these systems, but what we can
do using these new genomic tools is

01:21:49.170 --> 01:21:53.330
to look at environmental genomes
to take DNA from the rocks,

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:57.740
squeeze DNA out of the rocks or
out of the sulfur and the fumaroles

01:21:57.740 --> 01:22:01.050
and sequence all the genes
that are present there.

01:22:01.050 --> 01:22:04.680
And the interesting thing through
my lab's study of these systems is

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.130
that many of the same
metabolisms and properties

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:13.920
that Martin's group saw through
their phylogenic analysis also fall

01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:17.230
out of these environmental
genomes, so evidence for the role

01:22:17.230 --> 01:22:20.380
of hydrogen, NCO, and
carbon monoxide

01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.350
in these systems, for example.

01:22:22.350 --> 01:22:25.110
The abundance of clostridia
in these systems

01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:30.030
which we suspect might be playing
a role in acetate production

01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:33.270
that can be utilized by other
components of the community.

01:22:33.270 --> 01:22:37.380
And so we've done surveys
of many of these systems

01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:39.910
for functional genes related to

01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:42.940
and involving carbon
cycling and hydrogen cycling.

01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:47.280
Shown here is a study from a site
we work at in Northern California

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.120
where ancient sea floors
arrived on the continents

01:22:50.120 --> 01:22:53.450
and thereby enabled us to study
the subsurface at the site.

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:55.940
And so you can see numerous genes,

01:22:55.940 --> 01:23:01.640
what is presented here is numerous
genes related to hydrogen cycling,

01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:06.940
carbon cycling and carbon fixation
present in these high pH sites

01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:10.680
where it's up to pH 12
in terms of the solution.

01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:17.460 position:56%
You can do phylogenetic analyses of
some of these genes and find, again,

01:23:17.460 --> 01:23:20.930
through these environmental
genomic sequences that many

01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:27.890 position:56%
of these genes related to hydrogen,
oxidation or to carbon fixation come

01:23:27.890 --> 01:23:31.490
from organisms, like
methanogens or clostridia.

01:23:31.490 --> 01:23:36.560 position:56%
Okay, so there's really fascinating
insights that are very complementary

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:41.390
to analyses of single organisms
and their phylogeny to come

01:23:41.390 --> 01:23:45.860
out of environmental studies of
these natural extreme environments.

01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:49.490
So I think there's a lot of
insight to be had from looking

01:23:49.490 --> 01:23:53.780
from the top-down at these
systems, clues we can find

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:57.610
in both the physiology and
phylogeny of living organisms

01:23:57.610 --> 01:24:00.490
in these environments
thought to be either analogs

01:24:00.490 --> 01:24:03.480
or early earth environments
or at least places

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.640
where we can study the
relationships between abiotic

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.880
and biotic processes on the planet.

01:24:09.880 --> 01:24:14.810
And I think there's in some
cases, as I mentioned before,

01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:18.640
we're flooded with data in
many cases and so there's a lot

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.300
to be mined out of these datasets

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.630
that we haven't even
happened upon yet.

01:24:22.630 --> 01:24:27.830
One of the studies in
particular that I enjoy is looking

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:32.730
at the metagene on the
environmental genome

01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:35.600
of these single species
biofilms from Lost City

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:37.020
that we talked about earlier.

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:41.050
So this is like a single
population organism that grows

01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:45.140
within these chimneys that is
bathed in pH 11 fluid at 90 degrees

01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:48.490
and really seems to be
thriving in that system.

01:24:48.490 --> 01:24:52.360
And I already pointed out some of
the roles of things like hydrogen,

01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:56.060 position:56%
carbon monoxide and methane in these
systems, but you can look at things

01:24:56.060 --> 01:25:00.630
like transposases, so genes
involved in gene duplication

01:25:00.630 --> 01:25:02.620
and replication within
these biofilms.

01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:06.000
And what we found through the
study of the Lost City chimneys is

01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:09.890 position:56%
that something like 8% of sequencing
reads we found were associated

01:25:09.890 --> 01:25:11.190
with transposases.

01:25:11.190 --> 01:25:15.660
So order of magnitude more
of the reads are associated

01:25:15.660 --> 01:25:19.420
with these gene duplications than
we'd seen in many other sorts

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:24.110
of systems, like farm soil and
bioreactor sludge and so on.

01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:27.800 position:56%
So these hydrothermal vent chimneys,
in particular, seem to be hotbeds

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.200
for genetic exchange
and diversification even

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.500
if on the surface they look

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:36.210
like they're a clonal
population of organisms.

01:25:36.210 --> 01:25:39.010
And since this study
was published in 2009,

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:42.180
other studies of sulfide
chimneys have found similar -

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:46.700 position:56%
the black smoker chimneys have found
similar sorts of relationships.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:51.110
And so what this means is that it's
not just a single organism that has

01:25:51.110 --> 01:25:55.510
to have all of the properties
to survive, that the organisms

01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:59.190
within these biofilms can work
collectively and potentially carry

01:25:59.190 --> 01:26:01.310
out multiple functions
within the biofilm.

01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:04.490
So here's an example of
looking at nitrogenases,

01:26:04.490 --> 01:26:07.200
nitrogen fixation genes
within these biofilms.

01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:10.130
And we can see that even
though it looks homogeneous

01:26:10.130 --> 01:26:13.760 position:56%
from the standpoint of a species in
a traditional sense we had something

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.210
like 18 different nitrogenases
present in the biofilm,

01:26:17.210 --> 01:26:21.550
so lots of genetic diversity
that's not immediately apparent.

01:26:21.550 --> 01:26:29.890
And then additionally I wanted
to point out that we can,

01:26:29.890 --> 01:26:32.870
we should be able to train in with
higher resolution on these systems

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:35.300
and look at the relationships
between the microbes growing

01:26:35.300 --> 01:26:38.550
as biofilms and the
catalytic mineral surfaces.

01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.400
There's no reason we need to
be carrying out experiments

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:46.130
on organosynthesis at 300
degrees Celsius in high pressures

01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:48.850
in the absence of biology
and then train

01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:52.010
to grow our organisms
at 100 degrees Celsius.

01:26:52.010 --> 01:26:56.950
We should be able to better
replicate and study the systems

01:26:56.950 --> 01:27:00.580
and how they overlap
in space and time.

01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:06.150
And I'd like to finish up by saying
I think there's a lot of potential

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:09.360
to learn not just about how
processes work on our own planet,

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.540
but one of the best resources
we have out there is by looking

01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:14.490
at these other planets and moons,

01:27:14.490 --> 01:27:19.800 position:56%
looking at the potential subsurface
ocean on Europa or the cryovolcanism

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.580
in icy plumes coming
out of Enceladus

01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:25.830
or the hydrocarbon lakes
on the surface of Titan.

01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:29.450
So all these systems, whether
they have biology emerging or not,

01:27:29.450 --> 01:27:31.860
should be very interesting
comparisons

01:27:31.860 --> 01:27:36.190
from our own planetary neighborhood
that ought to allow us to look back

01:27:36.190 --> 01:27:39.930
into deep time and to think
about the conditions that led

01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:43.540
to the emergence of life on this
planet versus in other locations.

01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:46.550
And with the addition
of extra solar plants

01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:50.630
to the menu we have even more
opportunities to consider

01:27:50.630 --> 01:27:57.960
and compare and maybe find
another parallel life form existing

01:27:57.960 --> 01:27:59.260
out there.

01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:00.600
And so I'd like to finish
by saying thank you,

01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:03.510
and I'd be happy to
take any questions.

01:28:03.510 --> 01:28:12.740
[ Applause ]

01:28:12.740 --> 01:28:15.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: Sure, sounds great.

01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:28.960
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: That's
you, that's me, that's you.

01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.260
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: Okay.

01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.560
I have myself over here.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.970
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: There you go.

01:28:32.970 --> 01:28:36.320
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Okay, is
everyone ready for the pop quiz?

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.620
[laughter] Great.

01:28:37.620 --> 01:28:44.160
Does anyone have questions
for Matt, just to begin?

01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:46.650
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: Sure.

01:28:46.650 --> 01:28:49.830
&gt;&gt; You mentioned that the carbonic
side is a critical molecule

01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:53.780
for the [inaudible] processes
and it's also a critical molecule

01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:55.470
for the prebiotic chemistry.

01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:56.770
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: Right.

01:28:56.770 --> 01:28:58.070
&gt;&gt; In the primitive atmospheres.

01:28:58.070 --> 01:29:00.500
And the question is that
what is the energy source

01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:05.120
that basically creates the CO.
This is a [inaudible] question how

01:29:05.120 --> 01:29:09.580
to create CO, which is
available for this processes?

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.810
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: Typically,
as far as I understand it,

01:29:11.810 --> 01:29:17.900 position:56%
the carbon monoxide is created by
geologic processes, so it's produced

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:24.660
by degassing of earth materials
and it's a component of the fluids

01:29:24.660 --> 01:29:25.960
that are coming out
of these systems.

01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:32.570
So I mean that's my understanding
is the biology doesn't play a role

01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:35.460
in producing the CO.

01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:39.710
&gt;&gt; So [inaudible] associate CO2 and
actually it's not a small amount

01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:42.770
of energy, it's not a fraction of
electro volts, it's more than that.

01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:44.070
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: Right.

01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:47.220 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So, and the second question is
that have you had the chance to look

01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:57.110
at how a population on those fields
changes over some time scale?

01:29:57.110 --> 01:30:00.030
Let's say that solar activity?

01:30:00.030 --> 01:30:01.480
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: I'm sorry,
what was the last part?

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:03.100
&gt;&gt; Like solar activity cycle,

01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.590
let's say over 11 years,
have you had the ...

01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:08.290
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: I mean
there's been a number

01:30:08.290 --> 01:30:09.590
of interesting opportunities.

01:30:09.590 --> 01:30:12.670 position:56%
I could point out just a few, one of
which is the single species biofilm

01:30:12.670 --> 01:30:14.630
at Lost City that I
was talking about.

01:30:14.630 --> 01:30:17.000
It hasn't changed, that's what's
been so interesting about that.

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.990
Site after site we sampled
there, year after year,

01:30:19.990 --> 01:30:23.400
these same organisms exist
within those chimneys.

01:30:23.400 --> 01:30:27.000
So it really must be
adapted to that environment.

01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:30.940
In fact, the only other place
those organisms have been found is

01:30:30.940 --> 01:30:34.130
recently a similar system was
discovered in New Caledonia

01:30:34.130 --> 01:30:37.600
at the Bay of Prony with
hydrothermal chimneys like this

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:40.860
and the same organisms are
all over those integrated

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:42.300 position:56%
within the carbonate chimneys there.

01:30:42.300 --> 01:30:46.810
So it's a really interesting
system in terms of its uniqueness,

01:30:46.810 --> 01:30:50.210
as well as the resilience
of this populations.

01:30:50.210 --> 01:30:53.360
At the same time the black smoker
chimneys are incredibly diverse

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:58.530
and dynamic, so you've got meters
per second hydrothermal fluids

01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:02.510 position:56%
circulating through those, gradients
that select for different organisms

01:31:02.510 --> 01:31:04.470
across those chimney walls.

01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:12.520
So it's a very diverse system
and very subject to both regular

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:16.630
and episodic changes, so I mean
volcanoes, magma moves around

01:31:16.630 --> 01:31:21.620
and volcanoes explode and it's not
a great long-term place to live

01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:23.850
or just to be in the same
place at the same time.

01:31:23.850 --> 01:31:26.710
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: I could
just throw in there that some

01:31:26.710 --> 01:31:29.390
of the scientists I've talked
to, such as Everett Shock

01:31:29.390 --> 01:31:36.540
from Arizona State, goes to
Yellowstone and samples a set

01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:40.510
of 60 hydrothermal
pools in a different,

01:31:40.510 --> 01:31:43.740
a wide range of different kinds
of conditions - alkaline and basic

01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:46.590
and hot and just warm and so forth.

01:31:46.590 --> 01:31:51.010
And he's doing just that, a
longitudinal study, so he goes back

01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:54.750
and samples the same set of
pools every year and is looking

01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:57.390
at those kinds of long-term
temporal changes.

01:31:57.390 --> 01:32:02.690
So, yes, this is a very exciting,
ongoing area of research.

01:32:02.690 --> 01:32:06.410
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: And so your
last comment actually feeds

01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:10.100
into the first question that
I had in terms of tempo.

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:13.930
I talked to Dr. Cleaves before
I came and he said, you know,

01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:17.160
we don't know if this happened in
a weekend, these processes happened

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.060
in a weekend or if they
happened in a million years,

01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:24.770
so you had to have a precise
set or a precise sequence occur.

01:32:24.770 --> 01:32:30.400 position:56%
So how do we find that out in
modern time or what signs do we look

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:35.830
for either here or on a moon,
like Enceladus or Europa?

01:32:38.200 --> 01:32:42.010
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: I mean I think
it's a problem with many sorts

01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:45.370
of the experiments we do, even
if our question was something

01:32:45.370 --> 01:32:48.120
as tractable as let's
try to grow some

01:32:48.120 --> 01:32:50.000
of these organisms we
can't grow in the lab,

01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:53.640
the issue we might face
is the issue of time.

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:56.230
It might be that the organisms
divide once every 100 years

01:32:56.230 --> 01:32:59.830
or 300 years and that's out
of scale with our lifetimes,

01:32:59.830 --> 01:33:03.720
let alone a Ph.D. student's career.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:07.370
[laughter] So that's one
problem we face anyhow,

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:13.440
but without knowing the sequence of
events or even having a full list

01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:17.310 position:56%
of all the events that need to occur
I think it would be very difficult

01:33:17.310 --> 01:33:18.610
to constrain.

01:33:18.610 --> 01:33:24.010
But in my opinion the best approach
might be to look at a variety

01:33:24.010 --> 01:33:27.590 position:56%
of different analogs and get a sense
at what those time scales might be,

01:33:27.590 --> 01:33:30.040
so we can look at remnants
of the early earth

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:32.250
within our own solar system
and where we can look at places

01:33:32.250 --> 01:33:34.880
that had similar materials
but maybe didn't progress

01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:37.310
to having recognizable life.

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:40.090
Anyhow, we have a lot of
opportunities for observations

01:33:40.090 --> 01:33:44.370
to make that perhaps could feed
into models to help us come

01:33:44.370 --> 01:33:47.050
up with experiments that a
Ph.D. student could actually do.

01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:48.350
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Right, perfect.

01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:51.350 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes, so one of
the things that interests me as I go

01:33:51.350 --> 01:33:58.710 position:56%
around and talk to these folks is
just that question of are we talking

01:33:58.710 --> 01:34:02.520
about - if you're trying to
reconstruct these early systems,

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:04.900
you know, how you get
a living system

01:34:04.900 --> 01:34:08.680
from rocks and seawater and heat.

01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.150 position:56%
Do you have, is it a gradual process

01:34:13.150 --> 01:34:19.220
of chemical systems
forming simple molecules

01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:24.870
and over time putting themselves
together or do you build a system

01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:30.380
that is ready and then you
pull the trigger and go, right?

01:34:30.380 --> 01:34:34.930
I mean that's a really
interesting question.

01:34:34.930 --> 01:34:37.230
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Right here?

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:41.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.660 position:56%
When you talked about going from say
an RNA world to an RNA protein world

01:34:45.660 --> 01:34:50.590
or something like that, protein is
basically a bunch of amino acids

01:34:50.590 --> 01:34:56.580
that get tied together by
some sort of enzyme or RNA.

01:34:56.580 --> 01:35:00.530
And initially you get a whole
bunch of abiotic amino acids,

01:35:00.530 --> 01:35:03.250
but eventually they've
got to be synthesized.

01:35:03.250 --> 01:35:05.580
And has anybody looked
at the mechanisms

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:10.140
for synthesizing the amino acids
and how they may have evolved

01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:14.050
and whether there are
parallel different mechanisms

01:35:14.050 --> 01:35:16.740
which could have originated
separately?

01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.910
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes, I mean
I'm sure Matt has something to say

01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:24.340 position:56%
about that, but among the people
that I've been talking to, you know,

01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:29.540 position:56%
as I look at and talk to different
people working on the origin of life

01:35:29.540 --> 01:35:36.090 position:56%
from different angles it seems to me
that everybody has their own model

01:35:36.090 --> 01:35:39.140
and they get so far
down or so far up.

01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:45.020
And then at some point everybody
says and then magic happens, right?

01:35:45.020 --> 01:35:49.140
[laughter] And so I've started
to think about this zone of magic

01:35:49.140 --> 01:35:50.440
and what exactly is that?

01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:54.540
And kind of everybody zeroing
in, homing in on it somehow.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:36:02.120
And that right there is to me the
heart of the zone of magic, right?

01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:10.960
How do you get nucleotides
associated with amino acids

01:36:10.960 --> 01:36:17.270
so that they are ordering them
and polymerizing them into chains

01:36:17.270 --> 01:36:20.970
to build things that
actually do something,

01:36:20.970 --> 01:36:23.390
that catalyze further
reactions, right?

01:36:23.390 --> 01:36:27.900
So people are looking at that
and trying to find out ways

01:36:27.900 --> 01:36:35.630
in which you can get, say, small
nucleotides, strings of nucleotides

01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:41.010
that can trigger, create
a peptide bond and link

01:36:41.010 --> 01:36:43.700
to amino acids together, right?

01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:48.670
&gt;&gt; Creating the amino
acids, themselves?

01:36:48.670 --> 01:36:52.750
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Creating
the amino acids themselves.

01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:57.330
Those can fall out of things
like the acetyl coenzyme,

01:36:57.330 --> 01:37:04.420
a pathway that Matt described
or the reverse TCA cycle,

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:08.790
what we know as the orthocreb
[Assumed Spelling] cycle.

01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:16.160
Different parts of those metabolic
pathways you can produce both

01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:23.180
nucleotides and amino acids,
as well as lipids, yes.

01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:25.600
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: I think
there are numerous sources

01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.980
of at least the amino
acids, themselves,

01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:29.760
that could have fed
into these models.

01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:34.760
It's this question of associating
those amino acids into proteins

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:40.390
and then relating that to the RNA
or DNA, whatever the molecule is

01:37:40.390 --> 01:37:41.980
that you're going to follow-up on.

01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.210
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: And so
that actually makes me think

01:37:44.210 --> 01:37:49.080
of a question that I had
during your talk, Nathaniel.

01:37:49.080 --> 01:37:54.020
You mentioned how Gilbert went
from seeing spaces to modularity,

01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:56.250
and I was wondering do
you know anything about

01:37:56.250 --> 01:37:59.560
or has your research
shown anything about how

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:02.640
that thought process
happened for him?

01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:08.280
How do you go from, you
know, DNA or RNA or genes,

01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:11.300
which we typically think
of as like words on a page

01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.600
and if you're missing those words

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.390
on the page then how do you
think, oh, it must be ...

01:38:15.390 --> 01:38:20.000
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes,
so as I said, this is ongoing

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.960
and I'm trying - I'm still
like I've got long enough

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:27.800
from Gilbert earlier this
week that actually filled

01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:29.740
in several phases for me.

01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:36.720 position:56%
And this idea of the exons
floating on a sea of introns, right,

01:38:36.720 --> 01:38:40.070
that process, I narrowed it

01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:49.080
down to somewhere probably
during 1978, all right?

01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:56.710
And or late '77, and I'm still
trying to get - the problem is

01:38:56.710 --> 01:39:03.170
that people construct their own
narratives of what happened,

01:39:03.170 --> 01:39:11.200
and as an oral historian part of my
job is to cut across those stories

01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:15.200
that they've been telling for so
many years and get them to kind

01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:18.700
of break through and reconstruct
their thought processes

01:39:18.700 --> 01:39:22.220
in a new way that's different from
their kind of canonical narrative.

01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:26.890
I actually had to persuade one
of the actors for Doolittle

01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:31.830
that this was one way of
telling the RNA world story.

01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:35.650
When I explained it
to him he said, yeah,

01:39:35.650 --> 01:39:37.590
that is a legitimate
way of telling it.

01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:42.880
But he had bought and told
the conventional story.

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.570
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Right,
he had his own version,

01:39:44.570 --> 01:39:46.580
the version that he liked to tell.

01:39:46.580 --> 01:39:47.880
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes.

01:39:47.880 --> 01:39:50.960
I want to just call on
Mary, who I think wanted

01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:52.260
to jump in on that last point?

01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:53.630
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Oh, sure.

01:39:53.630 --> 01:39:55.940
&gt;&gt; Mary Voytek: Yes, I heard your
question a little differently

01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:57.680
and so I'm going to answer
it slightly different

01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.020
in that it is very easy
to make an amino acid.

01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.340
They're made in all sorts
of different places.

01:40:03.340 --> 01:40:05.330 position:56%
You don't need a cycle that's driven

01:40:05.330 --> 01:40:07.760
by a biological system
and metabolism.

01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:09.060
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: True.

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.660
&gt;&gt; Mary Voytek: We find amino acids
all throughout basically our solar

01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:15.390 position:56%
system and maybe the rest of the
universe, we find them in meteorites

01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:20.000 position:56%
that we know are not biological, and
you can get polymerization of them,

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.550
not with a particular order
or not directed, I should say,

01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:28.300
as in the system, but you
can get small polypeptides,

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:30.660
you can certainly get
dipeptides and tripeptides

01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.220
without invoking anything but -
and a lot of reactions and a lot

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:41.770
of biomolecule precursors are made
without any biology involved in it.

01:40:41.770 --> 01:40:43.070
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Yes, thank you very much.

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:49.390
I mean that kind of stems -
actually, as I said that I realized

01:40:49.390 --> 01:40:51.590
that that's also an
important answer.

01:40:51.590 --> 01:40:54.470
So thanks for chiming
in on that, yes.

01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:56.660
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: And over here?

01:40:56.660 --> 01:41:03.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'm a little bit concerned that
you keep bringing hydrothermal vents

01:41:03.410 --> 01:41:06.330
as opposed to geothermal vents.

01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:09.210
I thought we thoroughly vetted them

01:41:09.210 --> 01:41:14.360 position:56%
because in life hydrothermal vents
would be diluted, poisoned by sodium

01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:18.820
and have no energy to survive.

01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:23.480
And these Martin comments have
been just thoroughly refuted

01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:26.410
by Buzz Jackson [Assumed Spelling]
in general medical evolution

01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:32.070 position:56%
from a purely thermodynamic point of
view, which I argued 15 years ago.

01:41:32.070 --> 01:41:36.520
So what are your arguments
in favor of hydrothermal

01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.070
as opposed to geothermal vents?

01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:41.880
Thank you.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:44.170
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: The
points I was trying to get

01:41:44.170 --> 01:41:47.560
across was not necessarily an
argument in favor of hydrothermal

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.340 position:56%
or even deep-sea hydrothermal vents.

01:41:49.340 --> 01:41:54.140
I actually was, have been
very influenced by this idea

01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:55.680
of connected environments.

01:41:55.680 --> 01:41:59.370
It's a near certainty meteorites

01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:04.540
and their components were hitting
the planet early on and in many

01:42:04.540 --> 01:42:08.890
of these systems you're confronted
with the same problems of dilution

01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:12.020
and trying to concentrate
things on surfaces.

01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:16.230
So one thing to recognize
about these systems,

01:42:16.230 --> 01:42:18.850
whether it's a geothermal
or hydrothermal system,

01:42:18.850 --> 01:42:20.360
is that they're a system in motion.

01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:25.670
So the reaction conditions
that synthesize molecules

01:42:25.670 --> 01:42:29.370
at 300 degrees Celsius or
whatever don't stay in that place

01:42:29.370 --> 01:42:31.780
for any great length of time.

01:42:31.780 --> 01:42:35.510
In many cases they move on to
some other catalytic environment.

01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:40.490
So what I favor is this
idea of connectivity

01:42:40.490 --> 01:42:42.850
between different types of systems.

01:42:42.850 --> 01:42:50.110
I think going from
observations of fluid circulations

01:42:50.110 --> 01:42:56.940 position:56%
to multifaceted model of bubbles
and particle formation is, you know,

01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:00.770
a few steps removed from what we
observe in the natural systems,

01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:04.340
but I think by studying the natural
systems we can learn something

01:43:04.340 --> 01:43:07.850
about how these places actually
function from a physical

01:43:07.850 --> 01:43:09.480
and chemical perspective.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.910
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Do you think
it makes sense to think instead

01:43:12.910 --> 01:43:19.790
of this idea of life popping
out of the ocean or wherever

01:43:19.790 --> 01:43:22.920
at some magical moment in time,

01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:30.650
rather the earth becoming a
biotic, a geobiotic system?

01:43:30.650 --> 01:43:34.100
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: I think at
a global scale that's likely,

01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:36.910
I mean that's what's
happened, there's people

01:43:36.910 --> 01:43:39.960 position:56%
and animals and bacteria, elephants.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:46.560
But in terms of, you know, I think
even locally, even within the scale

01:43:46.560 --> 01:43:51.880
of a few kilometers or the scale is
larger than individual protocells,

01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.010
connected processes
likely played a role

01:43:54.010 --> 01:43:58.550
in this before the widespread
takeover of the planet.

01:43:58.550 --> 01:43:59.850
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes, okay.

01:43:59.850 --> 01:44:01.930
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: And
so we'll take a handful

01:44:01.930 --> 01:44:04.500
of questions before we
have to hop off the stage.

01:44:04.500 --> 01:44:06.090
Right there?

01:44:06.090 --> 01:44:09.760
&gt;&gt; Yes, I'm Ronald Wilson
with the Federal Government.

01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:17.690
My question is if scientists ever
can firmly establish the origin

01:44:17.690 --> 01:44:19.230
of life?

01:44:19.230 --> 01:44:24.980
What do you see as the probable
implications and significance

01:44:24.980 --> 01:44:31.280
of that for humanity, mankind,
society and this universe,

01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:34.400
which probably will come to
an end at some point in time?

01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:37.470
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: We can
probably come up with a scientific

01:44:37.470 --> 01:44:40.640
and a historical answer
to that question.

01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:41.940
You want to go?

01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:43.240
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: And ethical.

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:44.540
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Yes.

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:45.840
&gt;&gt; Matt Schrenk: I suppose.

01:44:45.840 --> 01:44:48.780 position:56%
I mean I think it's, from a
scientific perspective it would open

01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:52.280
up all sorts of considerations
in terms of the probability

01:44:52.280 --> 01:44:55.620
or possibility of life
on these other planets

01:44:55.620 --> 01:44:57.260 position:56%
and moons circulating and the stars.

01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:02.830
So if it turns out to be
highly likely, probable,

01:45:02.830 --> 01:45:07.310 position:56%
then we might accelerate our efforts
to learn if there's more life

01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:12.940
out there or certainly have a whole
different perspective on our life

01:45:12.940 --> 01:45:19.760
on the uniqueness or importance
of our life on this planet.

01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:24.440
But in terms of, you know, there
might also be other considerations

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:28.140
with our ability to
synthesize life out of nothing.

01:45:28.140 --> 01:45:30.280
You know, what are the
ethical considerations?

01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.190
A lot of these same concerns are
being met with synthetic biology

01:45:35.190 --> 01:45:38.860
and genetic modification and
sort of deconstructing cells,

01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:44.860 position:56%
so I think we need to also consider
those perspectives in this, as well.

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:49.180
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: And
we will in the next session.

01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:53.080
I could just chime in very briefly
and say from a humanistic point

01:45:53.080 --> 01:46:00.490
of view on one level it's a
wonderfully irrelevant question.

01:46:00.490 --> 01:46:03.980
It's not going to shape the outcome
of the next election or anything

01:46:03.980 --> 01:46:09.750
like that, but on another level
there's no more interesting

01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:11.590
question, right?

01:46:11.590 --> 01:46:21.740
It is the question, and so it
really would be morally profound

01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:24.230
if we could identify what that is.

01:46:24.230 --> 01:46:28.540 position:56%
And part of what that would mean
would be coming up with a definition

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:31.170
of what we mean by the
origin of life, right?

01:46:31.170 --> 01:46:35.530
And that in itself is a
very fraught question.

01:46:35.530 --> 01:46:38.940
A lot of scientists just throw up
their hands and say never mind,

01:46:38.940 --> 01:46:43.220 position:56%
I'm just studying the chemistry, but
others say, oh, how would you know

01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:47.590
if you found life unless
you know what life is?

01:46:47.590 --> 01:46:54.490
And so there are important
questions of humility and our place

01:46:54.490 --> 01:46:59.900 position:56%
in the universe, our responsibility,
our stewardship of the planet,

01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.600
whether we have the
ability and the right

01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:09.860
to colonize other worlds,
things like that, so.

01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:11.160
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Yes,
and I think I approach it

01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.870 position:56%
from a place of just pure curiosity.

01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:19.420
How do you have a world that
has a mouse and elephant, right?

01:47:19.420 --> 01:47:23.540
Like how did we get everything
that's ever been created

01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:24.840
by an organism?

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:26.140
How did we get Facebook?

01:47:26.140 --> 01:47:27.440
How did we get Donald Trump?

01:47:27.440 --> 01:47:29.280
How did we get Hillary
Clinton, right?

01:47:29.280 --> 01:47:33.380
All of those things come
from this singular question

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:35.070
of how life started, so.

01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:38.770
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: And,
boy, would I like to know.

01:47:38.770 --> 01:47:40.070
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Right.

01:47:40.070 --> 01:47:41.370
Right here?

01:47:41.370 --> 01:47:44.560
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort: Actually, I
think we're going to have to ...

01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:45.860
&gt;&gt; Nsikan Akpan: Okay.

01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.350
Great, well, I would like to thank
Nathaniel and also to thank Matt

01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:51.960
and it's been a really
fascinating discussion.

01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:54.510
&gt;&gt; Nathaniel Comfort:
Thank you very much.

01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:57.080
[ Applause ]

01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:00.200
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of The Library of Congress.
