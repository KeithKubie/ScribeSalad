00:00:02.032 --> 00:00:07.808
Delta Robots are comprised of
three articulating arms
connected to an output stage.

00:00:07.808 --> 00:00:13.778
They are extremely precise
and agile, and can be used for
"pick &amp; place" and 3D Printing.

00:00:13.778 --> 00:00:16.261
Researchers at the Wyss
Institute and Harvard SEAS have

00:00:16.261 --> 00:00:19.384
developed a millimeter-scale
delta robot, the "milliDelta".

00:00:19.384 --> 00:00:22.657
Possible applications at this 
scale include microassembly,

00:00:22.657 --> 00:00:26.591
micromanipulation, and tremor
cancellation in microsurgery.

00:00:26.591 --> 00:00:31.562
Our design is powered by three
independently controlled
piezoelectric bending actuators.

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:36.505
At 15 millimeters by 15 millimeters
 by 20 millimeters, it has a
payload capacity of ~3x its mass.

00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:41.492
It can operate with precision
down to ~5 micrometers, at
frequencies up to 75 hertz.

00:00:41.492 --> 00:00:46.473
and experience accelerations of
~22 gravitational acceleration.

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:51.423
The design has potential for
high bandwidth, high-precision 
applications at the 
millimeter-scale.
