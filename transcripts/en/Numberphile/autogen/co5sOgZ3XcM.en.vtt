00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.670
I got an interesting number sequence

00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680
I got an interesting number sequence
 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.439
I got an interesting number sequence
it's the collar Koski sequence and I'm

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
it's the collar Koski sequence and I'm
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.059
it's the collar Koski sequence and I'm
just gonna write it out and see if you

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069
just gonna write it out and see if you
 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.559
just gonna write it out and see if you
can see why it might be interesting we

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569
can see why it might be interesting we
 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.499
can see why it might be interesting we
go one two I'm gonna put a comma in 2 2

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:11.509
go one two I'm gonna put a comma in 2 2
 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:20.300
go one two I'm gonna put a comma in 2 2
1 1 2 1 2 2 sometimes I like to call

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310
1 1 2 1 2 2 sometimes I like to call
 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.490
1 1 2 1 2 2 sometimes I like to call
this the Rhodey sequence because it's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
this the Rhodey sequence because it's
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340
this the Rhodey sequence because it's
like 1 2 2 1 1 2 testing why is this

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350
like 1 2 2 1 1 2 testing why is this
 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.509
like 1 2 2 1 1 2 testing why is this
interesting this kick carries all like

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519
interesting this kick carries all like
 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.859
interesting this kick carries all like
this there's gonna be a pattern there

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869
this there's gonna be a pattern there
 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.060
this there's gonna be a pattern there
and you might think this is really

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
and you might think this is really
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.650
and you might think this is really
boring secrets got ones and twos and

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
boring secrets got ones and twos and
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.999
boring secrets got ones and twos and
it's that's not even any particular

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009
it's that's not even any particular
 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.160
it's that's not even any particular
order but let's look at the runs because

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170
order but let's look at the runs because
 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.280
order but let's look at the runs because
the numbers either kind runs of 1 or 2

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290
the numbers either kind runs of 1 or 2
 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.490
the numbers either kind runs of 1 or 2
interestingly so this is a run of 1 is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500
interestingly so this is a run of 1 is
 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.690
interestingly so this is a run of 1 is
just 1 1 2 1 here's a run of 2 because

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700
just 1 1 2 1 here's a run of 2 because
 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.910
just 1 1 2 1 here's a run of 2 because
there are 2 of them and the run of to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920
there are 2 of them and the run of to
 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.690
there are 2 of them and the run of to
run of 1 over N of 1 a run of 2 and have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
run of 1 over N of 1 a run of 2 and have
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.920
run of 1 over N of 1 a run of 2 and have
you noted something very interesting

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
you noted something very interesting
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.580
you noted something very interesting
this one starts 1 2 2 1 1 2 and here 1 2

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590
this one starts 1 2 2 1 1 2 and here 1 2
 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.439
this one starts 1 2 2 1 1 2 and here 1 2
2 1 1 2 and this will continue forever

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449
2 1 1 2 and this will continue forever
 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.700
2 1 1 2 and this will continue forever
in other words the sequence describes

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710
in other words the sequence describes
 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.120
in other words the sequence describes
itself by telling you the length of the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130
itself by telling you the length of the
 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.969
itself by telling you the length of the
run it's a very very famous sequence is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979
run it's a very very famous sequence is
 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.649
run it's a very very famous sequence is
one of the very first ones that was put

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659
one of the very first ones that was put
 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.840
one of the very first ones that was put
in the online encyclopedia of integer

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550
in the online encyclopedia of integer
sequences so people just say it's the

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560
sequences so people just say it's the
 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.770
sequences so people just say it's the
kind of Holocaust key sequence in fact

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780
kind of Holocaust key sequence in fact
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.240
kind of Holocaust key sequence in fact
there are only two sequences that have

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
there are only two sequences that have
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.850
there are only two sequences that have
this property and it's this one and this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
this property and it's this one and this
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.590
this property and it's this one and this
one which is the colic Oskar sequence

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600
one which is the colic Oskar sequence
 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.050
one which is the colic Oskar sequence
without the one so begins 2 2 1 1 2 1 2

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060
without the one so begins 2 2 1 1 2 1 2

Koski and I know that he came up with

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
Koski and I know that he came up with
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.960
Koski and I know that he came up with
this idea in the 1960s

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970

EBIT hand a way of representing this in

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
EBIT hand a way of representing this in
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.210
EBIT hand a way of representing this in
the rather Russell's a beautiful way we

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220
the rather Russell's a beautiful way we
 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.430
the rather Russell's a beautiful way we
have the sequence starts in the outer

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440
have the sequence starts in the outer
 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.780
have the sequence starts in the outer
circle so the inner one is describing

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790
circle so the inner one is describing
 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.730
circle so the inner one is describing
the length of run and obviously that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
the length of run and obviously that
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.680
the length of run and obviously that
therefore becomes a continuation of the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690
therefore becomes a continuation of the
 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.110
therefore becomes a continuation of the
same sequence and then within it within

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120
same sequence and then within it within
 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.830
same sequence and then within it within
it within it

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840
it within it
 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.100
it within it
so rather than one sequence and then the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110
so rather than one sequence and then the
 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.229
so rather than one sequence and then the
other one referring to it you have these

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239
other one referring to it you have these
 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.600
other one referring to it you have these
kind of concentric rings of referring

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610
kind of concentric rings of referring
 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.280
kind of concentric rings of referring
and referring and referring and that's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290
and referring and referring and that's
 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.750
and referring and referring and that's
kind of quite interesting in quite fun

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760
kind of quite interesting in quite fun
 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.720
kind of quite interesting in quite fun
and if you do all the twos one color and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
and if you do all the twos one color and
 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.400
and if you do all the twos one color and
all the whites another color say one

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410
all the whites another color say one
 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.280
all the whites another color say one
black or gray and then one white and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
black or gray and then one white and
 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.360
black or gray and then one white and
then you get rid of all the numbers cuz

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
then you get rid of all the numbers cuz
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.320
then you get rid of all the numbers cuz
I'm gonna get rid of all the numbers

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
I'm gonna get rid of all the numbers
 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.930
I'm gonna get rid of all the numbers
then you see is this kind of quite

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
then you see is this kind of quite
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.699
then you see is this kind of quite
striking this is why that's because it's

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709
striking this is why that's because it's
 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.300
striking this is why that's because it's
a coloring book well you know it's a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
a coloring book well you know it's a
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.400
a coloring book well you know it's a
coloring book but if I had this well I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
coloring book but if I had this well I
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.170
coloring book but if I had this well I
do have this but if I was not me and I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180
do have this but if I was not me and I
 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.729
do have this but if I was not me and I
was given this I'm not sure I would want

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739
was given this I'm not sure I would want
 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.110
was given this I'm not sure I would want
to color it in because I think actually

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120
to color it in because I think actually
 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.380
to color it in because I think actually
that what you get from contemplating it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390
that what you get from contemplating it
 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.569
that what you get from contemplating it
without color and you see how all fits

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:56.579
without color and you see how all fits
 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:03.860
without color and you see how all fits
in is rather beautiful

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870
 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.760
and you're looking at it and you're

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770
and you're looking at it and you're
 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:07.320
and you're looking at it and you're
seeing there are other patterns that you

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330
seeing there are other patterns that you
 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.240
seeing there are other patterns that you
can see so you've got this sore blob

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
can see so you've got this sore blob
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.160
can see so you've got this sore blob
here kind of gets bigger and bigger and

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170
here kind of gets bigger and bigger and
 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.750
here kind of gets bigger and bigger and
bigger because what's happening is that

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:12.760
bigger because what's happening is that
 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.330
bigger because what's happening is that
as they've got the rings get smaller it

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340
as they've got the rings get smaller it
 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.580
as they've got the rings get smaller it
happens further away so you get this

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590
happens further away so you get this
 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.180
happens further away so you get this
kind of shift Kolakowski sequence not

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190
