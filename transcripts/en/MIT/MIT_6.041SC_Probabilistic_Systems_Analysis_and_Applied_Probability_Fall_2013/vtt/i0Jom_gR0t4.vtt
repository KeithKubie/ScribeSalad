00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.420
 

00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.720
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:04.370
Today I'm going to talk about
Bernoulli process practice

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.840
number one.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.290
In this problem, you are
visiting a rain forest.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.920
But unfortunately you have run
out of insect repellent.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.020
As a result, the probability of
you getting mosquito bites

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.350
is really high.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.720
At each second, the probability
that a mosquito

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.820
will land on your neck is 0.5.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.130
If a mosquito lands on your
neck, the probability that it

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.210
will bite you is 0.2.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.520
And the probability that it will
never bother you is 0.8.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.750
All of this happens
independently among all

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.400
mosquitoes.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.530
For part A of the problem, we're
interested in finding

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.550
the expected value of the time
between successive mosquito

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.740
bites and the variance of the
time between successive

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.680
mosquito bites.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.260
From the problem statement we
know that the probability

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.950
distributions of getting
mosquito bites at different

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.400
times are identically
distributed and independent.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.480
Therefore, the mosquito bites
occur as a Bernoulli process

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.150
with parameter p, where p
represents the probability of

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.210
getting a mosquito bite
at each second.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:17.930
And p can be calculated as the
probability that a mosquito

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.590
lands on your neck at each
second multiplied by the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.315
probability that a mosquito will
bite you, given that it

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:28.220
has landed on your neck.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.170
 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:43.410
And this is equal to 0.5 times
0.2, which is equal to 0.1.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.240
Next let us define x as the
time between successive

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.540
mosquito bites.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.270
Because of the memory-less
property of the Bernoulli

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.470
process, which means the
probability of getting

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.260
mosquito bites at different
times are independent, x is

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.890
equivalent to the time until
the next mosquito bite.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.160
And x is a geometrical
random variable whose

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.770
PMF is like the following.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:17.030
 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.120
For all x, let's say equal
to 0, the probabilities

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.570
are equal to 0.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.280
For x equal to 1, the
probability that it takes 1

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.720
second to the next mosquito
bite is simply equal to p.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.240
And for x equal to 2, the
probability that it takes 2

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.170
seconds until the next mosquito
bite is equal to 1

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.890
minus p times p.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.710
 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.190
And for x equal to 3, the
probability that it takes 3

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.840
seconds until the next mosquito
bite is equal to 1

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.360
minus p to the power
of 2 times p.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.800
Similarly, for x equal to k, the
probability that it takes

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.720
k seconds until the next
mosquito bite is equal to 1

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.960
minus p to the power of
k minus 1 times p.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.550
 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:23.040
Therefore the expected value
of x is equal to 1 over p,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.880
which is equal to 1 over 0.1,
which is equal to 10.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.430
And the variance of x is equal
to 1 minus p over p squared,

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.680
which is equal to 1 minus 0.1
over 0.1 squared, which is

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.270
equal to 90.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.910
For part B of the problem,
we're considering

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.660
another type of bug.

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.720
Similar to the case as the
mosquitoes, here at each

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.460
second the probability that a
tick will land on your neck is

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.600
equal to 0.1.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.860
And if a tick lands on your
neck, the probability that it

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.310
will bite you is equal to 0.7.

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.210
And the probability that
it will never bother

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.630
you is equal to 0.3.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.980
And all this happens
independently among all ticks

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.339
and all mosquitoes.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.930
So similar to the case as part
A, where mosquito bites occurs

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.400
as a Bernoulli process with
parameter p equal to 0.1, here

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.500
the tick bites also across
a Bernoulli process with

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.660
parameter q equal to 0.1 times
0.7, which is equal to 0.07.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.700
And q is the probability
of getting a tick

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.910
bite at each second.

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.120
Therefore, the bug bites occurs
as a merged process

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.570
from the mosquito bites
and the tick bites.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.640
And let r represent the
parameter for the bug bites.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:06.920
So here r is equal to the
probability of getting either

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.467
a mosquito bite or
a tick bite.

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:23.460
 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.120
And this is equivalent to 1
minus the probability of

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:42.743
getting no mosquito bite
and no tick bite.

00:05:42.743 --> 00:05:47.440
 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.290
Because the mosquito bites and
the tick bites happens

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:54.540
independently, therefore this
can be written as 1 minus the

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:07.210
probability of no mosquito bites
times the probability of

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.380
no tick bites at each second.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:22.620
And this is equal to 1 minus p
times 1 minus q, which is p

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:34.080
plus q minus pq, which is equal
to 0.1 plus 0.7 minus

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.370
0.1 times 0.7.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:45.130
Which is equal to 0.163.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:53.230
Next, let us define y
as the time between

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.938
successive bug bites.

00:06:54.938 --> 00:07:08.780
 

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:15.160
So similar as x in part a,
here y is a geometric

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.550
distribution with parameter r.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:26.160
And therefore the expected value
of y is equal to 1 over

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:31.850
r, which is equal
to 1 over 0.163.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:37.930
That is approximately 6.135.

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:51.740
And the variance of y is equal
to 1 minus r over r squared,

00:07:51.740 --> 00:08:02.120
which is equal to 1 minus 0.163
over 0.163 squared.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:10.700
And this is approximately
31.503.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:20.350
So this gives us the expected
value of the time between

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.280
successive bug bites and the
variance of the time between

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.950
successive bug bites.

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:28.280
And this concludes our
two days practice

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.530
on Bernoulli process.

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:30.550
