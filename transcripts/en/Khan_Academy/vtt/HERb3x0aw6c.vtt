00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.990
Arjun opened up a savings account last
year and put

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.730
an initial sum in it. Let M of t
denote

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.760
the account balance M measured in dollars

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.730
t days since it was opened. What does
the statement

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.859
M of 30 minus M

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.130
of 0 equalling a hundred mean?
Before I look at the choices, let's think

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.039
about what this means.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.340
When you input t equals 30 into your
function,

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.820
you're going to get M of 30.
So let me make that clear. So if you say t

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.550
is equal to 30, you input that into your
function

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.920
M. You're going to get -- you're going to
get

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.890
M of 30. So one way to think about it
is --

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.719
This is the account balance 30 days
since it was opened. This is when t is

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.800
equal to 30. This is the account balance
after 30 days

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.260
Let's write that down. Balance -- balance

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.260
after 30 days. Now, by the same logic, this
right over here this is when we put t

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.650
where we said t equals 0. This is the balance
after 0 days, or you could say this is

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.939
the initial balance.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.520
initial -- initial balance.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.100
So what they're doing -- they're taking our
balance after 30 days, and

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.740
from that they're subtracting the initial
balance and they're saying that

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.560
equal to 100.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.990
So there's a couple ways you can
interpret this and I haven't even looked

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.460
at these choices yet. We'll see if
any of these match up.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.390
You could say that your balance after 30
days is a hundred dollars more than the

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.930
initial

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.979
balance. Or another way to think about is
you added a hundred dollars in the first

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:35.049
30 days.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.280
Those are both legitimate ways to think
about it. I'll see which of these choices

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.680
are

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:44.159
consistent with that. 30 days after it was
opened, the balance of Arjun's account

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.409
was

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.500
equal to 100. No, that's not what that's
saying.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.829
This statement right over here -- the
balance 30 days after opening --

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.829
this statement right over here -- this
would be equivalent.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:58.040
This is equivalent to saying that, M of

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.259
30 -- this is the balance after 30
days after it was opened --

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.250
is equal to 100. That's not what they tell us here.
They tell us that the difference

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.300
between the balance after 30 days and
the initial balance -- that's a hundred.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.080
So we can rule that one out. Arjan had
the initial amount of money in his account

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.990
30 days after he opened it. So if he had
the same amount -- if he had the initial

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.810
amount -- let me

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.520
write this down. So had the initial
amount of money -- the initial

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.400
amount of money

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.980
is M of 0. So they're saying he had the
initial amount of money in his account

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.000
30 days after he opened it. Well, the amount
that he had in his account

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.310
30 days after he opened it is M of 30.

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.520
So these are the same amounts of money
then this --

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.260
In order to be consistent with this,
you would have an equation like this. M of 0,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.080
the initial amount,

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.920
is equal to the amount after 30 days.
That's not what they told us over here.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.250
We can rule that out. And then finally

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.830
we have the choice Arjan made a profit
over a hundred dollars

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.200
over the first 30 days since the account
was opened.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.000
That seems reasonable that his balance
is a hundred dollars higher. The

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.550
difference between -- if you take the initial
balance and subtract it from his balance

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:10.550
after 30 days,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.300
it's a hundred. And this right over here is a
hundred higher than his initial balance.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.470
So it makes sense that maybe he got the
profit out of an interest or

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.239
something else

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.860
that he got in his bank account over the
first 30 days.
