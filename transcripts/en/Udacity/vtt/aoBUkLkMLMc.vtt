00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Well, we just saw the code for processing these tokens,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and we know that it went to a bit of trouble

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to store the beginning position, lexps,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and then the ending position,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
but then--phwoomp--subtract out 9.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So this is way too much.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We went to a lot of trouble to drop

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
&lt;script type"--blah, blah, blah--so this one doesn't match.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Similarly, this one doesn't match.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This one looks perfect! It has stripped out the tag at the beginning

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the tag at the end.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This one still has the tag at the end, so it's not right.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In the particular example we're using,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
the Satasai or Bihari Satsai

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
are 700 verses from the 17th century.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
They're written in Hindi

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and they cover topics from morality to devotion, to love.

00:00:49.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Good stuff!
