00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.490
We can actually create a chart straight from the report.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.490
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:06.850
&gt;&gt; not all chart types are accounted for in the report

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:09.410
itself, but what's great about creating a chart directly from the report

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:12.320
is if you put it in multiple dashboards, it can have a

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.680
uniform way of showing all that data across all those different dashboards.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.500
&gt;&gt; Makes sense.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.140
&gt;&gt; So, if we click Customize and go back into the report.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.800
We can add a chart type straight to our report right here.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.630
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.730
&gt;&gt; And

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.620
so, what do you think? Bar chart? That

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.170
probably sounds like it makes the most sense.

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.460
&gt;&gt; Bar chart makes sense, yeah.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.900
&gt;&gt; So, on the X-Axis.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.620
&gt;&gt; I want to, I want to vertical of a bar chart.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.912
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:38.887
&gt;&gt; So X-Axis I want to be Purchase Date, yeah, and Y-Axis I want

00:00:38.887 --> 00:00:44.470
Total Spent, yes. And so, click this Group By field here. And we probably want.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.420
&gt;&gt; Ticket type? Oh, cool. Okay, that's very cool.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.760
&gt;&gt; But, what's really great, is we

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.410
can also change how it looks. So maybe if

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.120
you wanted to stack them, so they're in one.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:54.754
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:54.754 --> 00:00:55.390
&gt;&gt; Versus the other.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.710
&gt;&gt; Oh, nice. Yeah, sure, let's stack em. So, really quick, let's

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.510
just look at formatting, and see if there's anything we want to change there.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600
&gt;&gt; I give it a title.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.354
&gt;&gt; We also probably want to enable the Hovers. So

00:01:08.354 --> 00:01:11.310
that when we hover over any part of the chart.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.500
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.260
&gt;&gt; We actually see how much was spent for any individual.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.590
&gt;&gt; Cool.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.210
&gt;&gt; Hit OK. Awesome.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.090
So there's our little preview right there based off of the preview data.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.864
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:01:20.864 --> 00:01:23.760
&gt;&gt; But if we now Save and then Run Report,

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.780
then we can create another dashboard component off of this.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.050
&gt;&gt; Wow, that is awesome! So looks like in June we were

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.760
selling a lot of tickets. Actually in June, June was interesting, because

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.030
not only did we sell a lot of tickets, we sold about

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.470
the same as in July, for general admission, but VIP's were crazy.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.440
&gt;&gt; There must have been a special or something.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.350
&gt;&gt; Or maybe just the people who are

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.795
really into the festival, like buy early or something.

00:01:48.795 --> 00:01:49.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah. They, they get to be VIPs.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:50.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.810
&gt;&gt; Alright, that's pretty cool. So now I can, I'm guessing

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.340
I can figure out how to add this to the dashboard.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.610
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.260
&gt;&gt; I think.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.650
&gt;&gt; Try it out.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.985
&gt;&gt; Alright. You already saved it

00:01:59.985 --> 00:02:00.730
[LAUGH].

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.920
&gt;&gt; Kay, so saving was not the right idea there. But

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.760
I'm so terrified of messing up that I like saving a lot.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.760
&gt;&gt;

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.830
[LAUGH].

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.930
Okay, dashboard. going to have to Edit. Alright, so,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.467
I want to make my bar chart. I'm going to

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:18.910
drag this over. Not sure if I need to do that. My Data Source is total

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.670
revenue by month. Okay, that gave me a

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.600
graph but, this doesn't have the, like the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.440
blue and the green sections. That's, that's making

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.030
me sad. Should I, what should I do? Help.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.950
&gt;&gt; Little wrench.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.760
&gt;&gt; Little wrench. Always little wrench. Little

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.420
wrench is such a, a good tool. Okay

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.974
&gt;&gt; So if you notice that little check box in the upper-left.

00:02:39.974 --> 00:02:43.890
&gt;&gt; Use chart as defined, that makes sense. Okay, so I used the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.070
chart that I made in the report, and it gave me my favorite thing.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.070
&gt;&gt;

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:49.320
[LAUGH]

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.440
&gt;&gt; Very cool.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.220
&gt;&gt; Maybe we should edit the title and then Save and Run this dashboard again?

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.660
&gt;&gt; Sure. How do I run a dashboard?

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:58.620
&gt;&gt; click Close. Yep.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:00.450
&gt;&gt; Save and Close?

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.320
&gt;&gt; Yep

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.450
&gt;&gt; So this is not what a user would see, what we were just looking at?

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.590
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:04.040
&gt;&gt; That was the art

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.450
&gt;&gt; That was the editor.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.070
&gt;&gt; This is what a user would see.

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.430
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is what a user would see.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.020
&gt;&gt; This is a little prettier. Alright, this is very cool. So we

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.670
can track Revenue by Month. We can track Total Festival Revenue, and. What do

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:15.000
you think?

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.190
&gt;&gt; It looks really good.

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300
&gt;&gt; but I don't know if a bar chart

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.510
would of been the best way to display that data.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.870
Like, can you think of another type of chart

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.230
that we could have used that might of been better?
