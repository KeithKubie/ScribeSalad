00:00:00.311 --> 00:00:02.560
In the last video, I told
you that we would figure out

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:05.580
the final velocity of
when this thing lands.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:06.400
So let's do that.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.570
I forgot to do it
in the last video.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.460
So let's figure out
the final velocity--

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.320
the vertical and the
horizontal components

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.730
of that final velocity.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.950
And then we can reconstruct
the total final velocity.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.710
So the horizontal
component is easy,

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.918
because we already know that
the horizontal component

00:00:20.918 --> 00:00:23.975
of its velocity is this value
right over here, which we--

00:00:23.975 --> 00:00:26.060
this 30 cosine of 80 degrees.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.270
And that's not going to
change at any point in time.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.119
So this is going to be
the horizontal component

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.381
of the projectile's
velocity when it lands.

00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:36.880
But what we need
to do is figure out

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.310
the vertical component
of its velocity.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.950
Well, one thing we did
figure out in the last video,

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.260
we figured out what the time
in the air is going to be.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.970
And we know a way of figuring
out our final velocity

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.580
from an initial velocity
given our time in the air.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.127
We know that a
change in velocity --

00:00:58.127 --> 00:00:59.960
and we're only dealing
in the vertical now--

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.501
we're only dealing
with the vertical,

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.730
because the horizontal velocity
is not going to change.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.290
We've assumed that air
resistance is negligible.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.690
So we're only dealing with
the vertical component

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.450
right over here.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.680
We know that the
change in velocity--

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.340
or, we could say
the horizontal--

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.770
the vertical component of
the change in velocity,

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.680
is equal to the vertical
component of the acceleration

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.430
times time.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.930
Now, we know what
the change in time

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.810
is, we know it is-- I'll just
write down times our time.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.250
And what is our
change in velocity?

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.490
Well, our change in velocity
is our final vertical velocity

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.894
minus our initial
vertical velocity.

00:01:47.894 --> 00:01:49.810
And we know what our
initial vertical velocity

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.160
is, we solved for it.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.860
Our initial vertical
velocity, we figured out,

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.800
was 29.54 meters per second.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.220
That's 30 sine of 80 degrees,
29.54 meters per second.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.190
So this is going to be minus
29.54 meters per second,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.540
is equal to-- our acceleration
in the vertical direction

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.400
is negative, because
it's accelerating us

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.830
downwards, negative 9.8
meters per second squared.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.860
And our time in the
air is 5.67 seconds.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.460
Times 5.67 seconds.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.840
And so we can solve for
the vertical component

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.610
of our final velocity.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.830
So once again, this is
the vertical component.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.360
This isn't the total one.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.060
So, the vertical component.

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.884
Let me-- well I wrote
vertical up here.

00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:38.300
So there's the
vertical component.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.730
So let's solve for this.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.190
So if you add 29.54
to both sides,

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.590
you get the vertical component
of your final velocity.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.230
Well, this is a
vertical component,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.390
I didn't mark it
up here properly--

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.670
is equal to 29.54 meters
per second plus 9.8 plus --

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.790
or I should say minus--
meters per second.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.120
Minus 9.8 meters per second
squared, times 5.67 seconds.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.550
The seconds cancel out
with one of these seconds.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.630
So everything is
meters per second.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.820
And so, get the
calculator out again,

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:27.580
we have 29.54 minus
9.8 times 5.67.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:35.550
So we get our change-- our final
velocity is negative 26.03.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.564
So this is negative
26.03 meters per second.

00:03:40.564 --> 00:03:41.980
And you might say
wait, wait Sal ,

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.290
what is this negative 26.03
meters per second mean?

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.010
Remember, when we're dealing
in the vertical dimension,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.050
positive means up,
negative mean down.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.820
So it means we're going 26.03
meters per second downwards.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.860
Downwards, right when we land.

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.880
So what is our
total velocity when

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.190
we fall back to that landing?

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.440
So the vertical
component of our velocity

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.459
is negative 29.06 times .03
in the downward direction.

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.450
And the horizontal component
of our velocity, we know,

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.010
hadn't changed the entire time.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.410
That, we figured out, was
30 cosine of 80 degrees.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.720
So that over here, is
30 cosine of 80 degrees.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.760
I'll get the calculator
out to calculate it.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.290
30 cosine of 80 degrees,
which is equal to 5.21.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.080
So this is 5.21
meters per second.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.390
These are both in
meters per second.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.570
So what is the total velocity?

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.530
Well, I can do
the head to tails.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:55.730
So I can shift this guy
over so that its tail is

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.530
at the head of the blue vector.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:04:59.780
So it would look like that.

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.500
The length of
this-- the magnitude

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.397
of our vertical
component, is 29.03.

00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:08.480
And then we could just use
the Pythagorean theorem

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.949
to figure out the magnitude of
the total velocity upon impact.

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:14.490
So the length of
that-- we could just

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.470
use the Pythagorean theorem.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.710
So the magnitude of our
total velocity, that's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.980
this length right over here.

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.550
The magnitude of
our total velocity,

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.800
our total final velocity
I guess we can say,

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.540
is going to be equal to-- well
that's-- let me write it this

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.412
way.

00:05:32.412 --> 00:05:33.870
The magnitude of
our total velocity

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.328
is going to be equal to square
root-- this is just straight

00:05:36.328 --> 00:05:40.640
from the Pythagorean
theorem-- of 5.21

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:48.070
squared plus 29.03 squared.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.010
And we get it as
being the second--

00:05:53.010 --> 00:06:04.350
the square root of 5.21
squared plus 29.03 squared

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.870
gives us 29.49
meters per second.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.180
This is equal to 29.49
meters per second.

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.440
That is the magnitude
of our final velocity,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.120
but we also need to
figure out its direction.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.160
And so we need to
figure out this angle.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.320
And now we're talking about
an angle below the horizontal.

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.734
Or, if you wanted to view
it in kind of pure terms,

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:26.234
it would be a
negative angle-- or we

00:06:26.234 --> 00:06:28.560
could say an angle
below the horizontal.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:30.430
So what is this angle
right over here?

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.160
So if we view it as
a positive angle just

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.240
in the traditional
trigonometric way,

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.602
we could say that the-- we could
use any of the trig functions,

00:06:37.602 --> 00:06:38.685
we could even use tangent.

00:06:38.685 --> 00:06:39.590
Let's use tangent.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.980
We could say that the
tangent of the angle, is

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.410
equal to the opposite
over the adjacent--

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:50.690
is equal to 29.03 over 5.21.

00:06:50.690 --> 00:06:54.140
Or that theta is equal
to the inverse tangent,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:02.340
or the arctangent
of 29.03 over 5.21.

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:09.570
And that gives us-- we take
the inverse tangent of 29.03

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:17.380
divided by 5.21, and
we get 79.8 degrees.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.740
But it's going to be
79.8 degrees south,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.285
or, I guess, below
the horizontal.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.270
Or you could view this as an
angle of negative 79.8 degrees

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:34.380
above the horizontal,
either one of those work.

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.721
What's neat about this, is we
figured out our final velocity

00:07:37.721 --> 00:07:38.220
vector.

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.990
The entire vector, we know
what that entire vector is.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:49.790
It is 29.49 meters
per second at 79.8

00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:52.210
degrees below the horizontal.
