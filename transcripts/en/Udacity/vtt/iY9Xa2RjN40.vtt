00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320
The answer here, of course it's a bit subjective, but I think from just looking at the strategies

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.610
that these 2 algorithms use here, it seems as if the "Greedy" alogirthm

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.490
should perfom much better, because it always tries to cover as much as possible

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.700
in each round, while this one up here seems almost a bit stupid,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.550
because it just takes any edge and always blindly puts both endpoints into vertex cover.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.870
Although actually just 1 endpoint would be needed to cover that edge.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.490
You may already be guessing that I asked you this question

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.860
because I am now going to show you the exact opposite.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.530
Because it's the case that although this algorithm here seems better,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.320
and the strategy appears to make more sense,

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.960
actually from a point of approximation quality, at least if you consider the worst case,

00:00:40.960 --> 99:59:59.000
this algorithm up here, "Take 2," is actually the better algorithm.
