00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.650
- [Voiceover] We're asked to
use the "Reflection" tool to

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.850
define a reflection that
will map line segment ME,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.540
line segment ME, onto the
other line segment below.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.420
So we want to map ME to
this segment over here

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.350
and we want to use a Reflection.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.920
Let's see what they expect from us

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.050
if we want to add a Reflection.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.520
So if I click on this it says

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.550
Reflection over the line from,

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.450
and then we have two coordinate pairs.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.420
So they want us to define
the line that we're going

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.150
to reflect over with
two points on that line.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.320
So let's see if we can do that.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.982
To do that I think I need
to write something down

00:00:31.982 --> 00:00:34.840
so let me get my scratch pad out

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.340
and I copied and pasted the same diagram.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.390
And the line of reflection,
one way to think about it,

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.450
we want to map point E,
we want to map point E,

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:45.640
to this point right over here.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.960
We want to map point M

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.700
to this point over here.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.950
And so between any point
and its corresponding point

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.820
on the image after the reflection,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.550
these should be equidistant
from the line of reflection.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.910
This and this should
be equidistant from the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.180
line of reflection.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.490
This and this should be E,
and this point should be

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.650
equidistant from the line of reflection.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.210
Or another way of thinking about
it, that line of reflection

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.450
should contain the midpoint
between these two magenta points

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.400
and it should contain the
midpoint between these two

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.620
deep navy blue points.

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.750
So let's just calculate the midpoints.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.720
So we could do that with a
little bit of mathematics.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.120
The coordinates for E
right over here, that is,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.230
let's see that is

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.150
x equals negative four,

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.720
y is equal to negative four,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.450
and the coordinates for the
corresponding point to E

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.520
in the image.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.790
This is x is equal to
two, x is equal to two,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.750
and y is equal to negative six.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.710
So what's the midpoint between

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.950
negative four, negative four,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.720
and two, comma, negative six?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.750
Well you just have to take
the average of the x's

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.230
and take the average of the y's.

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:56.150
Let me do that, actually
I'll do it over here.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.260
So if I take the average
of the x's it's going to be

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.920
negative four, negative four,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.850
plus two, plus two,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.620
over two, that's the average of the x's.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.790
And then the average of
the y's, it's going to be

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:11.950
negative four plus negative six over two.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.870
Negative four plus negative six,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.050
over two and then close the parentheses.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.590
Let's see, negative four
plus two is negative two,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.450
divided by two is negative one.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.920
So it's going to be negative one, comma.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.620
Negative four plus negative six,

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.250
that's the same thing as
negative four minus six

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.990
which is going to be negative 10.

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.490
Divided by two is negative five.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.090
Let me do that in a blue color

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.620
so you see where it came from.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.380
Is going to be negative five.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.550
So there you have it.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.250
That's going to be the midpoint between E

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.020
and the corresponding point on its image.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.980
So let's see if I can plot that.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.490
So this is going to be,

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.050
this point right over here is going to be

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.520
negative one, comma, negative five.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.890
So x is negative one,

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.420
y is negative five.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.820
So it's this point right over here

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.650
and it does indeed look like the midpoint.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.820
It looks like it's
equidistant between and E

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.490
and this point right over here.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.620
And so this should sit on
the line of reflection.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.820
So now let's find the midpoint
between M and this point

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.950
right over here.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.470
The coordinates of M
are x is negative five,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.340
and y is equal to three.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.120
The coordinates here
are x is equal to seven

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.110
and y is equal to negative one.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.910
So the midpoint, the x
coordinate of the midpoint,

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.010
is going to be the
average of the x's here.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.790
So let's see it's going
to be negative five

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.750
plus seven over two.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.720
And the y coordinate of the
midpoint is going to be the

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.120
average of the y coordinates.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.290
So three plus negative one over two.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.550
Let's see, negative five of plus seven is

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.500
positive two, over two is one.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.650
Three minus one, three plus negative one,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.720
that's positive two over two is one.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.050
So the point one, comma, one
is a midpoint between these two

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.450
so one, comma, one, just like that.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.290
So the line of reflection
is going to contain

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.950
these two points.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.850
And two points define a line.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.190
Let me draw the line of reflection,

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.450
just 'cause we did all of this work,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.820
the line of reflection is
going to look something like,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.410
I want to draw this a little
bit straighter than that,

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.220
it's going to look something like this.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.320
And this makes sense that
this is a line of reflection.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.430
I missed that magenta point a little bit,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.310
so let me go through the magenta point.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.320
Okay, there you go.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.450
This makes sense that this
is a line of reflection

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.290
'cause you see that you
pick an arbitrary point

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.420
on segment ME,

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.220
say that point,

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.080
and if you reflected over this line.

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.390
This is the shortest
distance from the line.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.120
You just go onto the other
side of the line equal distant

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.190
and you get to its corresponding point

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:52.210
on the image.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.620
So it makes a lot of sense
that these are mirror images

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.150
if this is kind of the mirror here.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.150
And you can image that this
is kind of the surface of

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.100
the water, if you're
looking at it at an angle.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:03.350
I don't know if that helps you or not.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.710
But anyway we found two points.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.680
We found two points that
define that line of reflection

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:10.870
so now let's use the tool to type them in.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.690
One is negative one, negative five.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.050
The other is one, comma, one

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.490
so let me see if I can remember that.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.760
I have a bad memory.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.200
So one is negative one,
comma, negative five.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.090
And then the other one is one, comma, one.

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.810
And we see it worked.

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.120
We see it worked.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.840
When I did that, it actually
made the reflection happen

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.050
and notice it completely
went from this point

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.750
and now our blue is over the
image that we wanted to get to.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.340
So we are done.
