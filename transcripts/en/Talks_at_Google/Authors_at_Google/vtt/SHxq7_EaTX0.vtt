SUMI AGGARWAL: Welcome,
everybody, to Talks at Google.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.850
It's my great
pleasure to introduce

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.450
Lesley Stahl, one of our
country's most preeminent

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.480
journalists.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.840
She's been a correspondent
at "60 Minutes" for 25 years,

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.855
and has covered
pretty much everything

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:21.230
that's happened in the world
in the last quarter century,

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.990
from Guantanamo,
to all the wars,

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.490
to various
presidential campaigns,

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.500
to technology stories, which is
a particular area of interest

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.910
of hers, to sports.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.820
She is the winner
of 11 Emmy awards.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.831
And prior to
joining "60 Minutes"

00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:38.330
was a White House correspondent
during the Carter and Reagan

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.560
administrations, and was a
moderator of "Face the Nation."

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.680
She is the author of
two books, including

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.090
the one that is on sale in the
back called "Becoming Grandma."

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.740
So highly encourage everybody
to pick up a signed copy

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.930
of the book on your way out.

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.090
Great Mother's day gift.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.890
So get your shopping done early.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.940
There's also cards back there.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.680
So feel free to get
it done in one stop.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.830
And she is the proud
grandmother of two girls.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:03.610
Welcome, Lesley.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.680
LESLEY STAHL: Thank you, Sumi.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.240
Sumi neglected to say
that we're colleagues,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.330
because Sumi worked at "60
Minutes" till less than a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.830
year ago.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:12.900
SUMI AGGARWAL: Yes.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:13.670
I was a producer
there for many years.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.850
LESLEY STAHL: We
worked together.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.390
SUMI AGGARWAL: And had the
pleasure of working with Lesley

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.670
on a couple of stories.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.650
It was great.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.430
So tell me about the book.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.987
Did becoming a
grandmother surprise you?

00:01:22.987 --> 00:01:25.445
LESLEY STAHL: Well, I knew I
was going to be a grandmother,

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:27.220
so that didn't surprise me.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.710
What surprised me
was the enormity

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.280
of that initial emotion.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.790
This kind of wallop
of love that's

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.720
unlike any other kind
of loving that you

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.600
have for any other
creature on the planet.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.130
It's nothing like mother love.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.910
It's its own little animal.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.100
And when you become
a grandmother,

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.640
you change so dramatically
that your children

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.090
don't recognize you.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.440
They run around
saying, who is she?

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.960
Because you are so mush-bally.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.730
You are just a puddle of
whatever the kid wants.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.080
I believe that we are
actually-- that the word "no" is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.259
incapacitated.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.270
We cannot deny them anything.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.820
But really, it was that initial
jolt of elation and emotion

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.550
that I wanted to explore.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.990
What is that?

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.710
Do all grandmothers have that?

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.370
The answer is most of them do.

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.260
Do grandfathers have it?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.370
They do, but it's different.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:40.120
And look into the history, the
biochemistry, the anthropology,

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.690
the different kinds
of grandmothers--

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.130
step-grandmothers,
surrogate grandmothers.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.870
And even when there's
tension in the family

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.250
with the daughter-in-law.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.420
And there's a lot of tension
with the daughter-in-law.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.890
I wrote it as much
for your generation

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.450
as for my generation,
for young parents,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.400
because we're in this together.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.950
Young parents and their parents.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.790
We're the family.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.610
And so it's as geared
for my daughter,

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.714
who is a young woman with two
kids, as it is for my friends.

00:03:16.714 --> 00:03:18.130
SUMI AGGARWAL: So
as I was reading

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.955
the book, the thing that was
most enlightening to me--

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:23.900
so I'm the mother of a young
daughter who's six years old.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.350
But it really gave
me a look into what

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.380
my mom must be experiencing.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.680
And how she comes to it.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.040
And things that I feel like
can be a little meddlesome,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.482
where I'm like, mom, I'm
not going to do that.

00:03:34.482 --> 00:03:36.440
What are you talking
about And so it was really

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.330
an interesting kind
of insight into that.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.580
LESLEY STAHL: Does she meddle?

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.790
SUMI AGGARWAL: Sorry?

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.460
LESLEY STAHL: Does
your mother meddle?

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.350
SUMI AGGARWAL: She
very carefully meddles.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.410
She's very cautious about it.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.067
What do you think
of modern parenting?

00:03:49.067 --> 00:03:50.650
LESLEY STAHL: Well,
I'll tell you what

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.320
I think of modern parenting.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.640
But first let me say
that most grandmothers I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.100
met and interviewed, including
me, we walk on eggshells.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.090
We are so careful.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.210
We don't want our kids
to be angry at us,

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.670
because then we fear
they might deny us

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.900
access to the only thing
that really matters anymore.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.680
And it's those babies.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.110
So I had any number of
grandmothers I interviewed--

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.459
and I interviewed
a lot-- tell me,

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.810
my tongue hurts from biting it.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:26.951
Or, I won't even lift
an eyebrow in criticism

00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:27.950
of how they're doing it.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.880
And then the minute
you leave the house,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.810
you turn to your husband, or
he turns to you and you say,

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.190
we didn't do it that way
and she turned out OK.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.390
We were good at it.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.720
Well, the truth is we
weren't as good at it

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.210
as your generation is.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:43.259
That's the truth.

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.800
SUMI AGGARWAL: But I think that
puts more pressure on parents

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.720
as well.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.472
Now you're so concerned
about, they can't eat this.

00:04:49.472 --> 00:04:51.180
They have to go to
bed at a certain time.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.000
You have to follow the routine.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.960
It's a lot more.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.510
I mean, how did you manage that?

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.482
You had such a demanding career.

00:04:57.482 --> 00:04:59.690
How did you manage it when
your daughter was younger?

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.140
LESLEY STAHL: Well, I think
my generation of women

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.150
was much more focused on just
getting into the workplace.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.690
And it took a lot of energy
and a lot of attention.

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.290
We missed a lot with our
children that we regret.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.530
I think our attention
was truly divided.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.330
And I think our children--
you, my daughter,

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.120
a lot of the people
who work at Google

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.960
by the age I'm looking out
at here, you learned from us.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.090
Or maybe you resent
what we did it,

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.665
but you're doing it differently.

00:05:36.665 --> 00:05:38.790
And the truth is, I admire
the way you're doing it.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:44.000
I admire the way my daughter
is putting a lot of emphasis

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:44.590
on her family.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.880
Although, she has a big job.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.220
But she still is more--
she's building a better nest

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.350
than I did.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.997
I admit that.

00:05:53.997 --> 00:05:55.580
SUMI AGGARWAL: And
what are the things

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.180
that you notice that you
have to bite your tongue for?

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.770
Not necessarily about your
daughter, but generally.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.269
LESLEY STAHL: Oh,
I'll tell you one.

00:06:01.269 --> 00:06:03.120
Sleep training.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.120
I don't know how many
people here have children.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.985
Have you--

00:06:05.985 --> 00:06:07.360
SUMI AGGARWAL: Well, tell
us what sleep training is.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.430
LESLEY STAHL: No, I know.

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.830
But at Google in general.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.660
But I didn't sleep train,
so I had never heard of it.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.010
Apparently, it's
been around for ages.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.570
So the idea is after
a couple of months,

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.040
you just let the
baby scream and yell.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.640
And I just happened
to be there when

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.850
it happened with my husband.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.470
And I couldn't stand it.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.500
They didn't pick her up.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.750
They just let her scream
her little head off.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:28.670
My skin was crawling.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:31.880
But I didn't say a single word.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.290
I just sat on it.

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.007
I was hyperventilating.

00:06:35.007 --> 00:06:36.590
I thought I was
having a heart attack,

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:38.010
but I didn't say a word.

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.770
We get in the car, because
we were staying at a hotel.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.960
My husband turns to me and
says, what was that all about?

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.550
And I said, what?

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.070
I didn't say a word.

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:49.222
I was the Sphinx.

00:06:49.222 --> 00:06:51.190
He said, you didn't say a word?

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:53.570
You didn't shut
up the whole time.

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:56.670
So out of my mouth was,
why are you punishing her?

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.720
Why are you making
her-- I swear,

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.960
I didn't think I said a word.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.940
And it was just tumbling out.

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.430
I didn't hear myself.

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.830
Weird.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:06.680
I know.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.090
But for the most part,
my generation of parents

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.860
is sitting on it or
trying to sit on it.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:17.630
Because we want you to think
that we think you're wonderful,

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:20.260
so that you let us
have the babies.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.010
SUMI AGGARWAL: And so
tell me a little bit

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.350
about some of the science that
you found out about as you

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.400
were researching this book.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.149
What is the science
behind grandparenting?

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:28.807
What is the thing
that's happening?

00:07:28.807 --> 00:07:30.890
LESLEY STAHL: Well, there's
two interesting things

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:32.300
above all the others.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.000
One is the biochemistry.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.240
That enormous
wallop that I felt.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.750
And I felt it all over
my body, is actually

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:45.290
a biochemical response.

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:49.390
When a mother has a baby, her
brain is completely rewired.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:55.070
And all kinds of different,
new hormones come into play.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.230
A grandmother has
something somewhat similar.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.580
Her brain is also rewired,
not as extensively

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.980
and not as dramatically.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.770
But she also secretes
a bonding hormone.

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:11.210
And so she is physically binding
herself to that little baby,

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:12.490
just the way parents do.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:15.230
Well, it's not the way parents
do because it's not as intense.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.780
But we also go
through a connection

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:23.320
that holds us to that baby.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:26.240
So that when we don't see
the baby, we crave the baby.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:30.180
And it can happen to
a step-grandmother.

00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.429
It can happen to a
surrogate grandmother.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.340
It can happen to an
aunt, a great aunt.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:38.940
But when that baby is a
little kid and somebody who

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:42.600
thinks of it as
somewhat theirs, holds

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:45.064
it-- there's all kinds
of physical changes

00:08:45.064 --> 00:08:45.980
that go on within you.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.340
So that's one thing I thought
was pretty interesting.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.300
Oh, here's another thing.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.250
The circuitry of baby
loving in the brain

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.550
and in the body, the wires,
are exactly the same wires

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.480
as romantic love.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.620
They're the same pathway.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.110
So what was happening
to me and all us

00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:08.440
other grandmothers is
we're falling in love.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.560
We are literally,
actually, falling in love.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.150
And it feels like that.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.530
And we use language like that.

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:18.720
People say, I fell off a cliff
when I held my grandchild.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:21.780
Or, you feel just
wonderful all over.

00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:23.860
Or, I crave them when
they're not there.

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:28.710
So it is exactly the
same animal of feelings.

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:31.000
And the other thing
I found out was

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.950
that most animals on
the planet die when

00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:37.480
they can no longer reproduce.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:40.110
So when a female stops
being able to have

00:09:40.110 --> 00:09:44.050
babies, if she can walk or fly,
whatever, she goes over there

00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.170
and dies.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:50.590
Except for elephants,
whales, and humans.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:55.670
So why do we have extended
lives beyond menopause?

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.590
Why do we even have menopause?

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.980
Well, the answer is to
take care of the babies.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.390
Grandmother's raise the babies.

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.160
Both parents hunted.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.550
They went out into the
fields and raised crops.

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:10.400
And they left the babies
home with grandma.

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:17.040
And so I think there is
in us a kind of atavistic,

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.070
granular need to help
raise the babies.

00:10:21.070 --> 00:10:23.645
When we don't, we hurt.

00:10:23.645 --> 00:10:26.020
SUMI AGGARWAL: It's almost
like we're coming full circle.

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.450
You talk about granny nannies.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.480
What are granny nannies?

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.020
Tell us.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.270
LESLEY STAHL: Granny
nannies are grandmothers

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.490
who take care of
the babies two days

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:38.120
a week, three or four days
a week to help their kids.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.910
And today, in this country
now post-recession,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.780
both parents are working.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.700
And they're not making
as much as one person

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:49.470
made in my generation.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:54.150
So you need the help because
child care, good child care,

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:55.820
is exorbitantly expensive.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.030
I'm not telling anybody
anything they don't know.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:00.490
It can cost as much as college.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:03.620
So the babysitting
function is needed.

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:09.460
And my generation is spending--
here's a statistic I came upon.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:14.630
My generation is spending seven
times more on grandchildren

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:17.910
than grandparents
did 10 years ago.

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.230
And I'm not talking about toys.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:23.220
I'm talking about the crib.

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.790
I'm talking about the car seat.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:27.560
I mean, major items.

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.720
We're sending the
kids to school.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.730
We're paying medical.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:33.390
We're straightening their teeth.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:36.769
Grandparents are really
contributing in many ways.

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:39.060
SUMI AGGARWAL: Where does
grandpa fit into all of this?

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.143
LESLEY STAHL: Oh, grandpa.

00:11:40.143 --> 00:11:44.260
If grandmas think that we go
through a sea change, which

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:45.450
we do.

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.600
Our personalities change when
we're with those children.

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.680
I mean, with our kids,
we were policeman.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.050
And with our grandchildren,
we're playmates.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.620
Whatever they want.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.560
Grandfathers also go through
this huge metamorphosis.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.750
For a grandfather who
worked very hard when

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.860
the little ones-- his own
little ones were growing up,

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:09.700
they all think about
it as a second chance

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.910
to watch a child grow
up, to be in their lives.

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:15.260
And a lot of
grandmothers told me,

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:18.370
grandpa's a better
babysitter than I am.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.390
He's more patient.

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.580
He's more playful.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.620
I saw this over and over.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:30.100
Grandfathers are the
nannies, not grandmothers.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.880
In many marriages,
the husband is older.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.660
He retires.

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.990
Grandma's still working.

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.230
So he's the one who's
taking care of the babies.

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:40.680
And he's doing a great job.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.410
And he loves it.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:45.690
And if he has health
problems, the children

00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.130
are alleviating them.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.010
They're getting
rid of depression.

00:12:51.010 --> 00:12:52.815
They're staving off dementia.

00:12:52.815 --> 00:12:55.130
I mean, these are
actually studies

00:12:55.130 --> 00:13:02.420
that show that babies just
have this effect on us.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:04.155
It makes us healthier.

00:13:04.155 --> 00:13:05.410
It makes us happier.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:07.800
It makes us younger.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.439
I know.

00:13:09.439 --> 00:13:10.980
SUMI AGGARWAL: To
segue a little bit,

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.820
it is election season after all.

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.810
And all the presidential
candidates are grandparents.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.252
So I have to ask you, what do
you make of the race so far?

00:13:19.252 --> 00:13:20.710
LESLEY STAHL: Well,
one, I actually

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.360
thought age was
going to be an issue.

00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.006
When Hillary
Clinton announced, I

00:13:26.006 --> 00:13:27.380
thought that the
Republicans were

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:31.990
going to come in with a whole
coterie of younger candidates.

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.390
And they were just going to
harp and bang away at her being

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:37.630
in her late 60's.

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:38.130
Uh-uh.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.210
I mean, Bernie's 74.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:41.050
She's only 68.

00:13:43.724 --> 00:13:44.890
Do we know how old Trump is?

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.850
Is he 69?

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:46.730
Something like that.

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:48.063
SUMI AGGARWAL: I think 69, yeah.

00:13:48.063 --> 00:13:50.330
LESLEY STAHL: I was very
interested in Hillary

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:55.960
being a grandmother because when
I started working on the book,

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:58.040
she announced that
she was pregnant.

00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:59.560
I mean, her daughter
was pregnant.

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:00.240
Whoa.

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.240
SUMI AGGARWAL: It's not
the "National Enquirer."

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.700
LESLEY STAHL: That's a lead.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:07.880
And so I was curious
as to whether her

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.260
being a grandmother--
well, whether she'd use it.

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:15.700
And whether it would help her
or not to win the presidency.

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:19.520
So I went with Frank Luntz,
who's a Republican pollster,

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.150
to New Hampshire to sit
in on a focus group.

00:14:24.150 --> 00:14:27.390
And he tacked on a
couple questions for me,

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.480
and then let me
ask some questions.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.240
So they were all Republicans.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:35.640
And he got up there and he said,
what one word would you use

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.440
to describe Hillary Clinton?

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.364
Oh, god.

00:14:39.364 --> 00:14:41.030
If Hillary Clinton
had been in the room,

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:44.290
she would crawl up in a
ball and go sit in a closet.

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.010
Dishonest, liar, cold.

00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:51.510
They didn't say
corrupt, but that's

00:14:51.510 --> 00:14:54.110
what Trump is picking up on.

00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:55.120
But words like that.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.440
All negative.

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.480
All having to do
with dishonesty.

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.190
It was brutal.

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:02.620
Then, he let me get up.

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:06.410
And I asked, what one word comes
to mind when I say grandmother?

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:08.740
Oh my gosh, the words
were just-- all of them.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:11.450
Nobody had one even remotely
negative thing to say.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:19.330
It was loving, cozy, cookies,
unconditional love, lap, warm.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:23.088
So I asked them-- now,
they're all Republicans--

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:25.030
if they thought if
Hillary played up

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:27.310
that she's a grandmother,
some of those words

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.870
would rub off on her.

00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:32.790
And I was surprised because
they were all self-described

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.710
as conservative Republicans.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.180
Several of them,
many of them, said

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.610
they thought it would help
her as long as she didn't,

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.510
they said, exploit the child.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.830
Meaning walk around
with the kid on her hip.

00:15:46.830 --> 00:15:50.270
I'm sure Hillary's people have
done their own focus groups.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:55.090
I'm a little surprised she
hasn't made more of it.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:57.330
It could be that all the
other candidates are also

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:58.520
grandparents, I don't know.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.700
But that focus group
led me to believe

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.820
that it would soften her image.

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.710
And she's still having
those words come up

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:09.570
in all focus groups,
including with Democrats.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:11.417
So she could use a little--

00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:12.250
SUMI AGGARWAL: Yeah.

00:16:12.250 --> 00:16:15.340
LESLEY STAHL: People never
make much out of grandfathers.

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:18.070
Grandmothers, it's going
to be the word in front

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.724
of every woman who's ever
had a position of authority.

00:16:21.724 --> 00:16:22.390
She's a grandma.

00:16:22.390 --> 00:16:24.130
But grandfathers don't get that.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:24.310
SUMI AGGARWAL: Right.

00:16:24.310 --> 00:16:25.390
That's kind of a given.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:25.990
LESLEY STAHL: I know.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.230
SUMI AGGARWAL: What do you make
of Trump, the Trump phenomena?

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.438
LESLEY STAHL: Oh my goodness.

00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:30.740
SUMI AGGARWAL: Got to ask.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.656
LESLEY STAHL: I mean,
I'm like everybody else.

00:16:32.656 --> 00:16:34.230
I don't know what to make of it.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.520
It's not that I don't
know what to make of him.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.880
I don't know what to make of
the public reaction to him.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:42.890
I could go through
a litany of things

00:16:42.890 --> 00:16:47.630
he has said where I was sure--
I would have put money down

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.380
that it was over.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.820
When he went after
John McCain, saying he

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:54.860
wasn't a hero-- now that
was really early on.

00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.000
I knew for sure
that was the end.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.610
I knew it.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:03.360
Well, there have been
13, 14, 15 of those.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.300
And he always rises
from the ashes.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:10.930
So I wouldn't dare predict
and it's even hard to analyze.

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.140
But I know, I've pretty
darn sure, pretty

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.140
darn sure it's going to
be Hillary versus Trump.

00:17:17.140 --> 00:17:20.700
And they're really going
to do jobs on each other.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:26.069
It's really going to be a slug
fest of gigantic proportion.

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:29.910
Who can slime the other one
more is probably going to win.

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:33.310
Isn't that awful to
say about our country?

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:36.370
The other thing that strikes
me about this campaign-- and I

00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:38.580
think I've been struck
by it in the past,

00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:44.770
but never so intensely-- is how
few people give the candidates

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:46.230
to us.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.050
If you go out and count
all the people who

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:52.280
either went to a caucus
or voted in a primary,

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:57.070
it's a minute fraction of the
American adult population.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:18:01.080
And so the process just
doesn't-- it's not working.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.610
We have to fix it.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:03.892
Just have to fix it.

00:18:03.892 --> 00:18:05.600
SUMI AGGARWAL: And
the thing that strikes

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.410
me, as a former
journalist, is, how do you

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.270
report on somebody like Trump
when there's no fact checking?

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.280
I know at "60 Minutes,"
very particular.

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:14.720
Every script is footnoted.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.210
Everything is fact checked.

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.690
How do cover a candidate
in a responsible way who

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:21.815
really can't be fact checked,
or doesn't care, or--

00:18:21.815 --> 00:18:23.440
LESLEY STAHL: Well,
he is fact checked,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.050
but the public doesn't care.

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:28.680
There are any number of
newspaper columns written

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.980
about what he got wrong.

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.955
Television stories done
about what he got wrong.

00:18:33.955 --> 00:18:35.600
And people don't care.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.990
That's why I say it's the
reaction to him that's

00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:41.890
the unfathomable part of it.

00:18:41.890 --> 00:18:44.310
It's very difficult
to report on him.

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:47.120
I've studied his interviews.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.360
Because you know, I used
to do "Face the Nation."

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.220
And I used to love to
try and pin someone down

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:55.430
if they didn't want to
answer the first question.

00:18:55.430 --> 00:18:57.040
You went to the second question.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:59.870
And then, if you go to
the third, you're nagging.

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.750
But I would nag.

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:02.430
He's unnagable.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.870
You just can't get him
to answer the question.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:08.850
He gets away from it.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.754
So it's hard.

00:19:10.754 --> 00:19:13.170
SUMI AGGARWAL: And where is
the line between entertainment

00:19:13.170 --> 00:19:13.790
and journalism?

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:16.081
As you said, if this is going
to turn into a slug fest,

00:19:16.081 --> 00:19:19.860
it almost feel like a little
bit of a horse race, a boxing

00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:21.390
match, whatever you
want to call it.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.970
LESLEY STAHL: How
about stand-up comedy?

00:19:23.970 --> 00:19:26.130
No, seriously.

00:19:26.130 --> 00:19:31.030
Have any of you just sat
and watched a Trump rally?

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.230
None of you?

00:19:32.230 --> 00:19:33.610
He is hilarious.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.830
He is seriously hilarious.

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:38.640
It is a stand-up routine.

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:44.160
And I always thought that humor
was really, really important

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.450
in politics.

00:19:45.450 --> 00:19:48.530
Because I covered Reagan
and he was very funny.

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:52.440
But sweetly funny, but funny.

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.950
I also thought
likeability was crucial.

00:19:56.950 --> 00:20:01.170
It's certainly crucial to
leadership, to governing.

00:20:01.170 --> 00:20:05.510
But we are being presented by
this tiny sliver of the country

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:10.210
with candidates who are more
unlikable than candidates

00:20:10.210 --> 00:20:12.630
I think have ever been.

00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:14.620
Well, in time that we know of.

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.950
Certainly, in modern time.

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.700
The negatives, woo.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:24.490
Trump's are-- he has an
unfavorable rating of 67%.

00:20:24.490 --> 00:20:25.260
And Hillary?

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.080
Anybody want to guess?

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.274
56% negative.

00:20:29.274 --> 00:20:30.690
SUMI AGGARWAL: And
so as you said,

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:32.650
you covered Reagan
for a long time.

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.311
What do you make of the
almost deification of Reagan?

00:20:35.311 --> 00:20:36.310
LESLEY STAHL: Of Reagan?

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.750
SUMI AGGARWAL: Yeah.

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.600
LESLEY STAHL: Well,
he wasn't deified

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.100
in the beginning at all.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:45.690
In fact, there's a
little bit of similarity.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.700
There was a huge
chunk of the country--

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:51.600
because Reagan was very,
very, very conservative

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:55.910
for that period of time in our
history-- who thought never

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:56.460
Reagan.

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.840
So there was that huge chunk
of the population out there.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.390
The election was very close.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.340
Then he was shot early on.

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.990
And he handled that
with such grace

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:12.020
and, really, heroism that
he won everybody's heart.

00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.940
And people stopped and
stopped looking at him

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.170
in a two-dimensional way as a
guy who stood for these issues

00:21:18.170 --> 00:21:20.320
and started to see
the human being.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:22.270
And he had a quality.

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.830
And it's a quality we're not
seeing this time in anybody.

00:21:26.830 --> 00:21:28.920
He had sweetness.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.990
He had a special
quality of sweetness.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.570
And when you saw him, you
could disagree with him 100%

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:38.330
and like him.

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:41.320
And it goes a huge,
long way to govern when

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.936
you need to persuade people.

00:21:43.936 --> 00:21:46.310
SUMI AGGARWAL: Is the era of
sweetness over do you think?

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:47.860
Is there no room left in our--

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.520
LESLEY STAHL: Oh, well,
I would never say that.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:53.555
When Jimmy Carter
was president, there

00:21:53.555 --> 00:21:54.680
was so much gloom and doom.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.880
Reagan used to run around
the country saying, what's

00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:58.190
with the gloom and doom?

00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:59.310
But there was.

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.580
We were very pessimistic.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:02.780
Nothing was working.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:05.080
There were gas lines.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.970
There were food
lines for people.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.340
People were suffering so much,
they were standing in line

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:11.720
to get food.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:14.124
We had high inflation,
high unemployment.

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:16.040
You never thought it was
going to turn around.

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.800
And Reagan came in.

00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:21.980
And pretty soon, we
were feeling good again.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.590
The economy cranked back up.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.260
So I mean, these
things are cyclical.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.634
I think we might
have sweetness again.

00:22:29.634 --> 00:22:30.800
SUMI AGGARWAL: One can hope.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:32.380
I want to bring you
back to something

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:34.310
you were saying earlier
about Hillary Clinton

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:35.210
being a grandmother.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:36.890
And one of the
interesting things

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.620
to bring it back
your book as well,

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:41.820
was when you wrote about
how being a grandmother

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:45.590
actually helps women
break the glass ceiling.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:46.970
Tell us a little bit about that.

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.170
LESLEY STAHL: OK.

00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.270
First of all, you will observe
that women in high places

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.150
today are grandmothers.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:23:01.720
Nancy Pelosi, when she was sworn
in as Speaker of the House--

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:02.260
is she?

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:02.880
Yeah.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.120
Do you remember then?

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.970
You all remember she had
all her grandchildren

00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.160
on the stage with her.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.240
And I actually did
a story on her.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.990
She "ruled" in a maternal way.

00:23:14.990 --> 00:23:18.780
She ruled the house with an iron
fist, but a maternal iron fist,

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.460
like the mother,
the policewoman.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:28.040
She had an instinct that said
that grandmother image can

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.690
be a formula for authority.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.370
And so I came to
see that while it's

00:23:35.370 --> 00:23:38.840
still difficult for the
country as a whole, and for men

00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.590
specifically, to
accept a young woman

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:43.920
in a position of
authority, it's not

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.570
hard to accept a grandmother.

00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:49.220
Because very often
in our families,

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:52.320
they were the tough
one in the family.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:58.530
And so I had a
girlfriend tell me--

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.420
she ran a girls'
school in New York.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.170
And for her, she
was there forever.

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.140
She stayed at that school
and ran that school

00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:06.410
for years and years and years.

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:08.940
She always had trouble
with the fathers.

00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:11.830
They were always in her
face telling her what to do

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:13.690
and poking at her.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:16.630
One day, it just stopped.

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:17.670
It just stopped.

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.240
And she was able to control
the meeting with the father

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:21.770
and everything was wonderful.

00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:24.340
And then she realized
that he was seeing her

00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.500
not as a young, sexy woman,
but as a grandmother.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:33.210
And so his need to fight with
her, or to challenge her,

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.960
stand up to her, was over.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:38.550
So grandmothers can
be authoritative

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:41.380
in the public's eye.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.810
And again, I'm surprised Hillary
isn't playing it up more.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:47.860
And you know, grandmothers
aren't old anymore.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:48.960
They're baby boomers.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.130
And baby boomers are young.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:54.390
They think of
themselves as young.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.460
They act young.

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.350
They dress young.

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:57.650
They look young.

00:24:57.650 --> 00:24:58.850
Believe me, we're tired.

00:24:58.850 --> 00:25:01.380
I'm telling you that when I
chase after my grandchildren,

00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:02.610
I am very tired.

00:25:02.610 --> 00:25:04.580
But we put on a good face.

00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.360
Another grandmother in
the audience laughing.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.850
So I don't think we have the
same image that grandmothers

00:25:11.850 --> 00:25:14.970
had certainly when
I was growing up.

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:17.880
Or maybe even when
you were growing up.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.960
SUMI AGGARWAL: And so
here in the Valley,

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.840
we talk a lot about
diversity in tech and making

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:29.810
sure that there's representation
of women on teams, especially

00:25:29.810 --> 00:25:31.524
in the more technical fields.

00:25:31.524 --> 00:25:33.440
With a little bit of
distance and perspective,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.481
what do you make of that?

00:25:34.481 --> 00:25:36.790
Especially given your research.

00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:38.480
LESLEY STAHL: Well,
I'll tell you,

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.110
this happened at "60 Minutes,"
too, while you were there.

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:49.970
I fear so often that women
take two steps forward

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:52.010
and a step and a half back.

00:25:52.010 --> 00:25:54.290
We take three steps
forward and two steps back.

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:57.530
And it's been that way ever
since the women's movement

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.550
in the early '70s.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.920
We think we're making
progress in the workplace

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.160
and then we find out that
we're still only making

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.210
$0.79 to the men's dollar.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:11.730
We still don't crash
through the glass ceiling.

00:26:11.730 --> 00:26:14.210
We still don't have many CEOs.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:16.110
And it's a bafflement.

00:26:16.110 --> 00:26:23.860
It's a bafflement that we don't
have more women in positions

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.210
of executive positions
where they're

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:28.340
making the big decisions.

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:30.700
When it's shown that women
make better decisions

00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:32.710
in many situations.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.980
And where women are better
educated, generally speaking.

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:40.230
As many PhDs and so forth.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.720
So it's a bafflement.

00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.190
And it's like a little
ache because I was there

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:48.570
at the beginning of the
women's rights movement

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:53.430
where I was so sure-- so
sure that women were just

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.200
going to sweep into
the presidency,

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.990
into the boardrooms,
into the executive suites

00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:03.370
in huge numbers within 30 years.

00:27:03.370 --> 00:27:05.950
And it's more than 40 years
ago that this started.

00:27:05.950 --> 00:27:07.900
So I don't know.

00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.390
I keep saying the
time will come,

00:27:09.390 --> 00:27:11.200
but when's it going to come?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.750
SUMI AGGARWAL: If there are
any questions in the audience,

00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:13.458
please feel free.

00:27:13.458 --> 00:27:14.972
But in the meantime--

00:27:14.972 --> 00:27:16.180
AUDIENCE: I guess two things.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:20.720
First of all, regarding women,
I think that there was a change.

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.180
Not enough, but
there is a change.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.310
And maybe I'm an
optimist, but it

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:29.840
seems like it shifted from
the world doesn't let women

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.800
do anything to that as well.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.500
But also, I think the
education back at home.

00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:41.277
I think parents should change
as well, not just the world.

00:27:41.277 --> 00:27:42.360
Not just the corporations.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.940
I think that still many
homes, not even intentionally,

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.750
are not raising
the girls in a way

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.580
that they even understand there
are options other than being

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:56.940
a girl or whatever it means.

00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:57.815
LESLEY STAHL: Really?

00:27:57.815 --> 00:27:59.660
I'm surprised to
hear you say that.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:02.690
AUDIENCE: I think we, as
parents, are-- at least some

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.922
of us, not doing the best job.

00:28:04.922 --> 00:28:06.630
Not necessarily because
we don't want to,

00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:08.110
but because we're
not aware of it.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:11.600
Because we grew up, even
my generation, in a way

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:13.572
that women has [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:13.572 --> 00:28:14.280
LESLEY STAHL: OK.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:15.890
Where did you grow up?

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:18.790
AUDIENCE: In Israel, and then
in the United States later.

00:28:18.790 --> 00:28:19.720
But in Israel.

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:23.450
And I think that it's still-- I
saw a lot of conservative-type

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:24.282
of homes.

00:28:24.282 --> 00:28:26.240
And again, not because
they wanted [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.107
LESLEY STAHL: Here?

00:28:27.107 --> 00:28:27.940
AUDIENCE: In Israel.

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:30.330
But also, I think I see it here.

00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:34.770
That it's conservative in a
way that nobody said that you

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:37.900
cannot be an engineer,
but it's not the point.

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:42.340
I mean, we're not talking
about a girl as an engineer.

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.390
LESLEY STAHL: You're
talking about being

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:48.196
told-- having a girl being told
you can be whatever you want.

00:28:48.196 --> 00:28:49.320
That should be the message.

00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:49.790
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:49.950
But I don't think that--

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:50.390
LESLEY STAHL: But it should be.

00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:52.681
AUDIENCE: I don't think that's
very common, even today.

00:28:52.681 --> 00:28:55.470
And not because the parents
are objecting to it.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.510
But still, it's
very conservative

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.020
that girls are girls
and boys are boys.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:02.160
And at least what
I'm trying to do,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:07.280
because nobody has the
golden-- is girls can be girls,

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.240
boys can be girls.

00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.270
But I'm trying to mix and match.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.377
So at least she knows she
can do whatever she wants.

00:29:14.377 --> 00:29:15.710
LESLEY STAHL: You know, that's--

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:16.889
AUDIENCE: And that's hard.

00:29:16.889 --> 00:29:18.430
LESLEY STAHL: I come
from, obviously,

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.080
a different generation.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:23.049
I was told I could
be anything I want.

00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:24.590
And so I'm a little
surprised to hear

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:28.540
you say all these generations
later you don't think

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.720
that that message is still
being sent to our kids.

00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.580
Because that would
be a message that

00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.920
comes down from my generation.

00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.015
AUDIENCE: Look at Google.

00:29:39.015 --> 00:29:41.690
The numbers that were
released to the public

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:45.220
shows that even
Google, where we're

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.650
doing whatever we can to
get as many women as we can,

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:49.980
especially engineers.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:53.690
There is not enough women
graduating universities

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:54.550
in computer science.

00:29:54.550 --> 00:29:55.790
LESLEY STAHL: And you
think that's the parents?

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:56.130
Really?

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:56.990
I thought that
was peer pressure.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:58.630
AUDIENCE: I think it's
partially the parents.

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:00.610
LESLEY STAHL: Girls think that
boys won't like them if they

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:01.955
go into science kind of thing.

00:30:01.955 --> 00:30:04.470
AUDIENCE: I think
that it's indirect.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:06.880
And again, I don't think
that a lot of the parents

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.620
are doing this in purpose.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:11.860
I think that in many cases,
they don't even think about it.

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.700
And at least in my case,
I think about that.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:16.482
I don't know if I'm
doing the right thing,

00:30:16.482 --> 00:30:17.440
but I think about that.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.780
And if anyone will convey any
other message to my daughter,

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:25.276
that's one of the things
that can really freak me out.

00:30:25.276 --> 00:30:26.400
LESLEY STAHL: Good message.

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.233
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:27.233 --> 00:30:30.687
LESLEY STAHL: For everybody
who's listening, yeah.

00:30:30.687 --> 00:30:31.520
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:34.562
And if we can go back to
television for a second--

00:30:34.562 --> 00:30:35.520
LESLEY STAHL: Anything.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.620
AUDIENCE: So
television was always

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:38.050
my dream, especially in news.

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:40.530
LESLEY STAHL: You wanted
to be a newscaster?

00:30:40.530 --> 00:30:41.810
AUDIENCE: Always.

00:30:41.810 --> 00:30:43.286
LESLEY STAHL: Here or in Israel?

00:30:43.286 --> 00:30:43.910
AUDIENCE: Here.

00:30:43.910 --> 00:30:47.810
This is the mecca
of-- and sometimes,

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:52.600
I report to Israeli television,
but just as a side hobby.

00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:56.230
But what I did
learn from reporting

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.395
to radio and television
in Israel for,

00:30:59.395 --> 00:31:03.910
let's say, 30 times
in my life, that it's

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:08.460
just unbelievable what happens
when something is broadcasted.

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.080
No one is watching broadcast
television, double quote.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:15.580
It's all video on demand.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:16.930
It's all Hulu and Netflix.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.810
Nobody's watching
anything on TV.

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:21.310
TV is dead and everything.

00:31:21.310 --> 00:31:26.370
But when my piece was
broadcasted on television,

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.480
my cellphone was
drained out of battery

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.850
from so many Facebook messages.

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:36.200
So my question to you is,
when you go into a studio,

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.570
not even reporting
from the field,

00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:40.890
today after so many
years, what do you

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:42.840
feel when you record in studio?

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:45.710
When you see a piece
that you did broadcasted,

00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:46.910
what does it make you feel?

00:31:46.910 --> 00:31:53.720
And what do you think the impact
today versus a few years ago?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.090
LESLEY STAHL: I guess
the thing that I

00:31:56.090 --> 00:32:02.970
feel is that I'm not sure
I'm having an impact.

00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:05.030
And it bothers me.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.800
I don't know how many stories
you did for "60 Minutes,"

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.070
but I've done a lot.

00:32:09.070 --> 00:32:11.350
Hundreds and hundreds.

00:32:11.350 --> 00:32:15.930
And many of them important,
important information

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.660
that the public should know.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.760
Change should have been made.

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.790
And it just sort of evaporates.

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.940
I feel it evaporates.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.660
So I guess people
have said to me,

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.920
oh, you have so much influence.

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:30.670
I fear that we don't.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:34.410
And I fear because we're doing
serious work, that's what

00:32:34.410 --> 00:32:36.640
"60 Minutes" is really about.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.060
So if we uncover an
injustice, or if we

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.670
show some corruption and
then nothing happens,

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.400
it's very discouraging.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:52.370
Sometimes, you have to have
the public exposed to a story

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:53.060
over and over.

00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:56.720
It has to linger before
it really has an impact.

00:32:56.720 --> 00:33:00.600
So "60 Minutes" does it, and
then someone else picks it up.

00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.810
And then maybe a congressman
makes a speech about it.

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:04.490
Maybe someone tries
to pass a law.

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.630
It has to go on and on.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:09.680
So you know, I sit
in the studio and I

00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.040
say to myself, OK,
is anybody going

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.150
to do anything about this?

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.830
That's what I think.

00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:17.980
SUMI AGGARWAL: But that
said, "60 Minutes" still

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.147
is the news magazine of record.

00:33:22.147 --> 00:33:22.980
LESLEY STAHL: It is.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.271
SUMI AGGARWAL: You get an
average of 15 million viewers

00:33:25.271 --> 00:33:26.740
every weekend.

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:28.370
LESLEY STAHL: But what happens?

00:33:28.370 --> 00:33:31.140
Did you ever do a story
that produced change?

00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.140
SUMI AGGARWAL: I did.

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:32.560
LESLEY STAHL: You did?

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:33.350
SUMI AGGARWAL: I did one.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:34.660
And I was very,
very proud of that.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.420
LESLEY STAHL:
Which one was that?

00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:36.720
SUMI AGGARWAL: The sugar one.

00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.420
LESLEY STAHL: And it
really produced change?

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.150
SUMI AGGARWAL: It
produced some change.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:41.240
It got the FDA to
start re-looking

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.871
at some of the classifications
that they had done.

00:33:43.871 --> 00:33:46.370
But no, I know exactly what you
mean, where you do the story

00:33:46.370 --> 00:33:48.040
and you're jazzed
for months going,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.555
this is going to be amazing.

00:33:49.555 --> 00:33:51.430
LESLEY STAHL: It's going
to blow the lid off.

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:52.360
SUMI AGGARWAL: And then you
send it out into the world and--

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.840
LESLEY STAHL: A
little crack, maybe.

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.298
SUMI AGGARWAL: So
that said, do you

00:33:55.298 --> 00:33:57.610
think television
news is-- should we

00:33:57.610 --> 00:34:00.705
be planning the funeral?

00:34:00.705 --> 00:34:02.080
LESLEY STAHL:
Well, first of all,

00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.570
television news has
changed dramatically.

00:34:05.570 --> 00:34:07.890
It's interesting that
"60 Minutes" hasn't.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:09.650
We're still doing
it the old way.

00:34:09.650 --> 00:34:12.714
We still use the old stopwatch.

00:34:12.714 --> 00:34:13.630
The way I [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:13.630 --> 00:34:15.449
SUMI AGGARWAL: [INAUDIBLE]
digital on that stopwatch.

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:17.407
LESLEY STAHL: Well, but
it's still a stopwatch.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.239
The stories are
done the same way.

00:34:23.239 --> 00:34:24.730
Same ethics.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:26.370
Same standards, all of it.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:32.139
But most news is changed because
of the shrinking of the time

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:34.699
it takes between the
reporter learning

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.909
something and the reporter
getting it out there.

00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:40.124
When I started,
there was a whole day

00:34:40.124 --> 00:34:42.560
to think because
we worked in film.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.690
And film had to be processed.

00:34:44.690 --> 00:34:47.280
And so you could really
make a hundred phone calls.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.652
And you could really suck
your thumb for an hour or two

00:34:50.652 --> 00:34:51.980
and think it over.

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:56.150
And then when we got videotape,
that time was shorter.

00:34:56.150 --> 00:34:57.680
And then we got cable.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.710
And those reporters had to
be on the air pretty quickly.

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:02.430
And now there's no time.

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:05.810
And that has changed the
nature of news dramatically.

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:14.960
So whether it's on television or
on the web, the nature of news,

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.460
by definition, is
completely, totally altered.

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.430
If I were doing daily reporting,
say covering the White House,

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:28.100
I wouldn't begin to
know how to do it today.

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:31.400
I really needed to make
a lot of phone calls.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.070
And I needed to understand it.

00:35:34.070 --> 00:35:37.300
And I don't understand how
you can just run out there.

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.410
I don't do that at
"60 Minutes" still.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:42.650
So I'm kind of one
of the lucky ones.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:45.330
But I think that
news is morphing.

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:47.300
I'm not saying it's
better or worse, actually.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:50.760
I shouldn't be judging, but
it's definitely different.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:54.580
But I think the appetite
for news is enormous.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:57.370
I think people want to know.

00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:59.080
They want to devour.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:02.470
And a lot of people
want in-depth reporting.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:06.220
I mean, our audiences
are enormous.

00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:09.380
And websites that are doing
in-depth investigative

00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:13.510
reporting are surviving
and are healthy.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.720
So I think people want
this kind of work,

00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:18.150
but not a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.240
Not enough.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:21.620
AUDIENCE: Keeping
on the news thing,

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.170
how do you feel about the
trend to so-called "comedy

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.300
news" like Stewart and Oliver?

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:29.330
LESLEY STAHL: Yeah.

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:32.660
What do I honestly think between
you and me and 38 other million

00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:33.880
people?

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.750
I think they're brilliant.

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.230
I think they're brilliant.

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:38.990
It's satire.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:45.886
And it's a form of commentary
that people listen to.

00:36:45.886 --> 00:36:46.760
People want to laugh.

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:50.127
We started out saying
that Trump-- one

00:36:50.127 --> 00:36:51.710
of the reasons I
think he's successful

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:53.520
is that he's really funny.

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.210
People want to laugh.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:37:00.980
And if you feed them the
cereal with sugar on top,

00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:03.570
they digest it.

00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:07.830
I did the Bill Maher
show the other night.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:09.341
He's brilliant.

00:37:09.341 --> 00:37:09.965
He's hilarious.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.060
Well, I used to watch
"The Daily Show."

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:16.960
I enjoy it.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.340
It's part of our life now.

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.560
It's part of our
society and our life.

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.440
It was a little
discouraging to find out

00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:26.780
that that was the only
news some of our children

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.170
were listening to.

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.040
That was a little hard to take.

00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.860
But you know, as the
kids get a little older,

00:37:34.860 --> 00:37:37.040
they start wanting something
a little more serious.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.990
At least that's what
I'm seeing in my family.

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:40.920
So I'm all for it.

00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:41.909
Are you against it?

00:37:41.909 --> 00:37:42.450
AUDIENCE: No.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:42.750
LESLEY STAHL: Oh, no.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:43.416
You love it too?

00:37:43.416 --> 00:37:47.019
AUDIENCE: I see Oliver
as the "60 Minutes" of--

00:37:47.019 --> 00:37:48.060
LESLEY STAHL: Absolutely.

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.220
Oliver is brilliant.

00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:53.280
But Bill Maher really
impressed me the other night.

00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:55.190
I think they're great.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:57.320
AUDIENCE: So talking about
the immediacy of news

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.860
versus the writing
of the book, how

00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.222
did the process differ for you?

00:38:02.222 --> 00:38:04.680
Were you employing a lot of
the same skills and techniques,

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.170
or was it a new
hat and experience?

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:09.030
LESLEY STAHL: It was new.

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:11.640
Well, the reporting wasn't
new, but the writing

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.180
was really hard.

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:17.150
Because the first draft that
I showed my husband, who's

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:22.190
a writer, he said, this is a
series of "60 Minutes" pieces.

00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:25.920
So I could write
about 15 minutes.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:31.220
But to write long form like
that really took a lot of work

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.780
for me.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:35.250
I had to figure out how to
thread everything together,

00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:38.840
which I could do it for 15
minutes and that was it.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.450
But I've really loved
working on this book.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:47.900
I met so many different kinds
of grandmothers and grandfathers

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.830
across the country.

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:52.130
And to find out that we're
all in this together,

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.540
we grandparents we're a society.

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.770
And our children and
how they relate to us.

00:38:56.770 --> 00:39:02.380
Meaning your generation, how
you relate to us, is a society.

00:39:02.380 --> 00:39:03.590
We're so connected.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:07.740
We're all in this campaign so
aware of how different we are.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.710
But we are all the
same grandparents.

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:12.760
Believe me, we're all the same.

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.060
We all love these
kids intensely.

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:19.690
We all change in the
way we grandparent.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:22.680
None of us can wait to
see those grandchildren.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.810
We annoy our children
because even if we're not

00:39:25.810 --> 00:39:29.960
saying anything critical, we
are doing a little body language

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.860
thing that really
irritates them.

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:33.790
And we're trying not to.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.840
So we are one big community.

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:37.840
And I found that out.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:40.600
And it was very heartening.

00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:43.840
But writing was a challenge.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.190
AUDIENCE: So you
mentioned that you're

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.890
disappointed that
women haven't reached

00:39:48.890 --> 00:39:51.790
higher levels in professions.

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:52.900
LESLEY STAHL: En masse.

00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:54.810
AUDIENCE: En masse.

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:57.450
And one thing that
occurs to me is that when

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:01.070
grandparents are living
close by to their children,

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:03.830
and they're willing to help out
with the child care, that that

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:10.320
may allow their daughter
to be in her profession

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:13.590
longer and reach higher levels.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.530
But it seems like
in this world, it's

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.000
a very international world.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.770
And we have people moving
across continents to take jobs.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.932
And their parents don't
always come with them.

00:40:23.932 --> 00:40:25.390
LESLEY STAHL: But
a lot of them do.

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:30.280
AUDIENCE: And so I
guess my question is,

00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:34.120
what is the responsibility
of women who have achieved

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:39.870
high levels in their profession
to make sure that they mentor

00:40:39.870 --> 00:40:43.530
other women or create
policies in the workplace

00:40:43.530 --> 00:40:48.650
to allow other women to
rise when they don't have

00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:53.950
as many advantages,
support perhaps?

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:57.850
LESLEY STAHL: Well, women
should mentor women, period.

00:40:57.850 --> 00:41:01.450
It's almost a given that
we need to help each other.

00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:04.450
So that is a necessity.

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:07.500
We haven't solved the
problem of child care.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.205
We just haven't.

00:41:10.970 --> 00:41:14.369
It may be one of
the main reasons

00:41:14.369 --> 00:41:15.910
that women don't
achieve because they

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.940
break their careers in half.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.930
Because they feel
they have to be home

00:41:19.930 --> 00:41:22.700
because they don't trust
the child care situation,

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.660
the daycare situation.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:27.540
It's a conundrum.

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:29.360
I'm not a policy person.

00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.790
I wish there were more
policy people working on it.

00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:36.460
And more openness from
our elected officials

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:44.240
to try and create a structure,
a grid, some way for families

00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.630
to be able to go to
work with peace of mind.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:55.580
It's a terrible, unsolved crisis
in the country-- child care.

00:41:55.580 --> 00:42:00.450
And I do come around
at the end of my book

00:42:00.450 --> 00:42:05.750
to say that this is the perfect
way from grandparents to end

00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:08.190
their extended retirement.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.430
And maybe not all
grandparents move,

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.590
but there is a huge
trend going on right now

00:42:13.590 --> 00:42:17.090
of grandparents moving to
be near their grandchildren.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:18.870
They do it selfishly.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:22.940
They want to be in
the babies lives.

00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:28.400
The smart parents will overlook
the little critical elbowing

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.590
and say, we need you.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.700
Because a woman going
to work will never

00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.990
trust anybody as
much as she'll trust

00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:40.120
her mother with her children.

00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:45.210
So for a lot of women,
that is the answer.

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:49.310
For women whose parents
cannot come and be near them,

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:51.920
we need more
government to help us.

00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:53.820
We do.

00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:55.110
Or societies.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:56.260
Or rotary clubs.

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.960
I mean, something.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.130
So it's something I
thought a lot about when

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:04.830
I wrote the book.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:09.090
I also wrote about
surrogate grandmothering,

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:13.090
parents who for any number
of reasons-- I mean,

00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:16.650
parents my age cannot be
with their own grandchildren.

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:17.790
Maybe they don't have any.

00:43:17.790 --> 00:43:20.946
Or maybe their daughters or
sons aren't going to have them.

00:43:20.946 --> 00:43:23.360
Or maybe the daughter-in-law
is not going to have it.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:27.010
But they can surrogate
grandparent another child

00:43:27.010 --> 00:43:29.440
somewhere else.

00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:33.850
It's a good way to take the
last 30 years of your life

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:36.040
because we're going
to live a long time.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.824
And we'll be
healthy, most of us.

00:43:38.824 --> 00:43:40.615
SUMI AGGARWAL: And with
that great thought,

00:43:40.615 --> 00:43:42.340
I want to thank Lesley
for coming to Google.

00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:42.680
LESLEY STAHL: Thank you.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.010
SUMI AGGARWAL: We appreciate it.

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:43.140
LESLEY STAHL: Thank you.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:43.640
My pleasure.

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.922
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:46.806
Thank you.

00:43:46.806 --> 00:43:48.397
SUMI AGGARWAL: And
I know you have

00:43:48.397 --> 00:43:50.980
to dash because you have to get
up to San Francisco and battle

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:51.930
Bay Area traffic.

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:53.180
But we have books in the back.

00:43:53.180 --> 00:43:55.560
So please, stop
by and grab some.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:58.449
LESLEY STAHL: And this is the
best Mother's Day present you

00:43:58.449 --> 00:43:59.490
can you give your mother.

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:00.680
I'm not kidding.

00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.810
Grandmothers are
adoring this book

00:44:02.810 --> 00:44:04.245
because I'm talking about them.

00:44:04.245 --> 00:44:04.730
SUMI AGGARWAL: LESLEY
STAHL: Thank you, Leslie.

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:05.980
LESLEY STAHL: Thank you again.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.860
Thank you, Sumi.
