00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:03.325
&gt;&gt; A conditioned taste aversion can occur when an organism ingests something and

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:07.900
it makes them ill. For example, Susan here has a conditioned taste aversion to

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.390
Moo Shu Pork. So Susan, how does that make you feel?

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.406
[LAUGH]

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:18.872
&gt;&gt; Oh gosh, I feel I feel like I might want to vomit and I'm salivating and I

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:23.144
don't like it at all.

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:24.296
&gt;&gt; I'm sorry, I'll, I'll put it down.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.542
&gt;&gt; Susan's nausea and sickness is paired with the sight, the smell and the taste

00:00:29.542 --> 00:00:34.706
of the food. So from an evolutionary perspective, this makes sense. We should

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:37.769
try to avoid things in the future that have made us ill. So sorry, Susan that

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.422
was just a little payback for Tickles the snake.

00:00:40.422 --> 00:00:41.510
&gt;&gt; I forgive you, Lauren.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.894
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:46.330
&gt;&gt; Here we can see that condition taste aversion happens after only one trial.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.490
That's different from classical conditioning, where we have repeated

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.590
presentations. For example, I got sick on Moo Shu Pork over ten years ago, and

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.023
as you can see today, I still can't stomach it. So, let's move away from the

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:01.656
Moo Shu Pork example. I'd like to finish this lesson on classical conditioning

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:04.617
by talking about a study that classically conditioned a sexual response to

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:06.550
women's black boots.
