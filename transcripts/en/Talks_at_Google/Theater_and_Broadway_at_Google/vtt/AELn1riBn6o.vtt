ALAN SEALES: The winner of five
2015 Tony awards, including

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.630
best musical, "Fun
Home" is based

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.870
on Alison Bechdel's best-selling
memoir of the same name.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:10.810
This groundbreaking
production introduces us

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.430
to the character of
Alison, and herself

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.600
at three different
ages, revealing memories

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.630
of her uniquely dysfunctional
family that connect her

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.020
in surprising new ways.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.920
And here to perform
with us today, please

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.430
welcome all three Alisons--
Gabriella Pizzolo,

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.510
Emily Skeggs, and Beth Malone.

EMILY SKEGGS: Hi, Google.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.450
It's good to be here today.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.450
So I'm going to sing a
song from the show called

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.660
"Changing My Major."

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.470
It's the moment in the show
where the college-age Alison

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.710
has woken up and
she has just slept

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.536
with a woman for the first time.

GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: Hi.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.140
There's a moment in "Fun
Home" when Alison and her dad

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:26.270
are in a diner, and Alison's
dad says, go find the waitress.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.890
And on Alison's way
to find the waitress,

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:33.576
she sees a woman who
she identifies with.

BETH MALONE: Hi.

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:37.630
I am them grown
up, older, and I'm

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:41.110
writing a book about those
moments in my life now.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:45.750
And so as I investigate
my past, the memories

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:47.810
sort of become all-encompassing.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:53.510
And this song takes place
in a car with my father

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:55.210
when I'm Emily's age.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.620
But I have remembered
it so fully,

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:04.450
and it has sort of put me in the
present in the car with my dad

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.919
at this age.

every so often, there

00:15:30.830 --> 00:15:34.950
was a rare moment
of perfect balance

00:15:34.950 --> 00:15:39.135
when I soared above him.

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:59.520
Five 2015 Tony wins, including
best musical score, and best

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.650
book, and of course
best musical.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:05.420
And so it was adapted from
Alison Bechdel's graphic novel,

00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.210
which, in real
life, the story is

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:10.340
about the character of Alison,
which the three of them

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.120
play over various times.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.520
And recreating, basically--
it's essentially

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.184
a graphic novel autobiography,
right, more or less?

00:16:21.184 --> 00:16:21.850
LISA KRON: Yeah.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:27.490
I mean, it's a memoir,
so I think it's maybe

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:28.640
a subtle distinction.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.120
But I think as opposed to
an autobiography, which

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:36.510
is about telling the story
of things that happened,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:39.150
I think in a memoir
there's something

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.580
essayistic about Alison's work.

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.110
And I think she's
interrogating questions

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.040
about who her father was,
about her relationship

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:52.100
with her father,
and about memory,

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:56.300
and the relationship of memory
to what actually happened.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:59.150
ALAN SEALES: So how did you even
come across the graphic novel?

00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:00.030
LISA KRON: Doesn't that
sound like a fun musical?

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:00.905
ALAN SEALES: It does.

00:17:00.905 --> 00:17:01.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.000
And it actually is funny.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:04.750
We'll get to that.

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.124
JEANINE TESORI:
It is very funny.

00:17:06.124 --> 00:17:09.069
ALAN SEALES: But how did
you find the graphic novel?

00:17:09.069 --> 00:17:13.920
What light went off saying, oh,
this needs to be on Broadway?

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.700
JEANINE TESORI: Well, the words
triagiocomic graphic novel

00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:17.382
memoir--

00:17:17.382 --> 00:17:18.840
LISA KRON: I mean,
come on, people.

00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:19.280
Come on.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.571
JEANINE TESORI: Musical comedy.

00:17:20.571 --> 00:17:21.540
Bam, bam, bam.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.520
Well, you know,
Lisa sent it to me,

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.349
and I don't know if any of
you have read that book.

00:17:26.349 --> 00:17:28.010
I had not, I'm
embarrassed to say.

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:31.460
And as soon as I read
it, I thought, oh my God,

00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:33.310
that's going to be
a fantastic musical.

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.380
It really sings.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:37.450
Getting there is
going to be hellish.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:41.240
And it was, because the
book is so beautiful,

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:43.120
and you have to-- at
one point, I think,

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.310
when you're adapting
something, you

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:45.726
have to what my
friend calls there

00:17:45.726 --> 00:17:47.300
has to be a lot of
spit on the page,

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:50.340
when you actually spit at
the very thing that you love

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.380
and make it your own.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:53.460
You have to render
that person invisible,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.700
like actors render us invisible
when they-- though we're

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.720
very visible, they
render us invisible

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:01.880
when they're on stage, as
if it wasn't ever written,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.250
it just always was.

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.410
And that was the trick with
that book, the pressure.

00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.110
ALAN SEALES: I mean, so you
found the book and you read it.

00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:10.651
But what was the
point when you said,

00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:12.792
I want to turn this
into a Broadway show?

00:18:12.792 --> 00:18:14.000
BETH MALONE: A Broadway show.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.725
ALAN SEALES: A Broadway--

00:18:15.725 --> 00:18:18.350
JEANINE TESORI: I never thought
this show would be on Broadway.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.970
I mean, let's be real.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:19.990
ALAN SEALES: Did you not?

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:20.490
JOE: No.

00:18:20.490 --> 00:18:22.170
I've been doing
this since I was 19.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:24.740
I was at Columbia and
then I played in the pit.

00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:26.700
I've seen what goes to Broadway.

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:28.770
It was not this show.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:30.020
I thought you just fell over.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:33.250
I was like, oh my God.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:34.880
I meant, it was
always meant for-- no,

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.984
I just think that Broadway has
cracked open in a way that--

00:18:37.984 --> 00:18:39.400
BETH MALONE: Sorry,
I'm upstaging,

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.400
because that's what I do.

00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:42.852
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:42.852 --> 00:18:45.060
JEANINE TESORI: Beth, what
are your thoughts on that?

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:45.870
BETH MALONE: You
know, basically,

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:47.930
when I first received the
script from my agent--

00:18:47.930 --> 00:18:48.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:51.090
I was like, this is going
straight to Broadway

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:53.766
and it's going to get me my
Tony nomination, finally.

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:55.140
And that's exactly
what happened.

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:55.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.812 --> 00:18:57.770
ALAN SEALES: And that's
all the time we've got.

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:58.460
Thank you guys.

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.400
JEANINE TESORI: Yes, goodbye.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:18:59.900
Thank you.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:03.832
I have nothing more to add.

00:19:03.832 --> 00:19:05.160
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.076
ALAN SEALES: Well, so
what were the challenges

00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:09.350
on getting it from your
concept onto the stage?

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:10.725
JEANINE TESORI:
Well, look at us.

00:19:10.725 --> 00:19:11.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.879
The challenges-- you
guys take that one.

00:19:14.879 --> 00:19:16.420
BETH MALONE: What
are the challenges?

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.290
JEANINE TESORI: Yeah.

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.520
BETH MALONE: Well, OK,
so who's read the book?

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:21.840
Anybody?

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.906
Yeah, it's like--
you've got to read it.

00:19:23.906 --> 00:19:25.530
Yeah, you should read
it, first of all.

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:29.130
But first of all, it's really
dense and it's really literate,

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:32.670
and it does a whole bunch
of things because she can.

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:36.090
Like, each chapter focuses on
a different literary character,

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:41.840
and she does all kinds of
literary masturbatory things--

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.620
I mean, fun but awesome
things, because she

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.314
can because she's a genius.

00:19:46.314 --> 00:19:48.730
You know, she's like, I'm going
to make this chapter this,

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:50.080
and I'm going to do
all these things.

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.371
And you're going to need a
thesaurus to read this book.

00:19:52.371 --> 00:19:56.120
Well, that kind of stuff doesn't
translate into scene work.

00:19:56.120 --> 00:19:59.740
A lot of the scenes, all
of the scenes that you see,

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.180
don't exist in the book.

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:04.520
So they had to be
created completely

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.180
out of the situations and
the need of the people

00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:10.400
in the moment to
try to figure out

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.545
what happens on a day when this
is what the scene is about,

00:20:14.545 --> 00:20:16.670
and no one's talking about
what the scene is about.

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:17.670
What do they talk about?

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.220
So there are all kinds
of crazy obstacles

00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:24.240
to getting to the
version that we have now.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.516
It was insane.

00:20:25.516 --> 00:20:26.890
EMILY SKEGGS: Or
a scene would be

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:30.640
built around one small
panel of the book.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.350
One little line and one tiny
drawing, an entire scene

00:20:34.350 --> 00:20:35.520
would be built.

00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.480
BETH MALONE: My suggestion
is to just read the play

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.560
and just take apart line by line
just the tree-planting scene.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.630
This is my favorite.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:45.980
I mean, I love the
tree-planting scene.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.420
LISA KRON: I'm not sure that
would be interesting for them.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:48.961
BETH MALONE: Well,
for me, if anybody

00:20:48.961 --> 00:20:54.000
is interested in how dialogue
works to inform you on what--

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.440
like, look at the-- you could
go-- all the information you're

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:01.680
receiving visually, you have to
receive through conversation.

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.420
That seems natural
and intention based.

00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.860
It's crazy what we had to do.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.330
LISA KRON: This is
sort of a nerdy theater

00:21:10.330 --> 00:21:12.460
conversation that's
happening sort of between us.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:18.420
And I think the graphic
novel is extremely literary.

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.280
That being said, it is
extremely accessible.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:27.050
It is-- what Alison understands
about the dynamic, engaging

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.920
mechanisms of that
form have made

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.420
her a master, an acknowledged
master, in that field.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.400
So it's a book that when people
read it, it's the kind of book

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.500
that then they give to
everybody they know.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.374
They'll buy it for
everybody in their family.

00:21:39.374 --> 00:21:43.830
It's an incredibly moving book.

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:49.190
There is nothing about
it, about the way

00:21:49.190 --> 00:21:52.230
that it functions, in the way
that it draws the reader in,

00:21:52.230 --> 00:21:56.030
that operates in any
way that's related

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.860
to the way a drama operates.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.670
So we had to take it apart.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.150
And it's such a beautifully
made masterpiece

00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.670
that it was very difficult
to take it apart,

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:10.850
because I would try to
read it just to figure out,

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.360
what are the events
in theatrical terms?

00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:18.310
And I would find myself
90 pages in again,

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:19.300
pulled into the story.

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:27.530
It was really difficult
to stay, to resist

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:30.010
the beguilement of
that book enough

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:34.230
to even see what it was made of,
to see its constituent parts so

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:38.430
that we could then make them
again in this different way.

00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:41.050
It was incredibly laborious.

00:22:41.050 --> 00:22:46.250
Usually if you can figure out
what the mechanism of a piece

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:48.670
is-- it's very difficult
to figure it out.

00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:52.450
I always think it's kind
of like throwing a pot.

00:22:52.450 --> 00:22:55.680
You have to-- as I understand
it, not that I'm a potter,

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.670
but you have to center the
clay exactly on the wheel.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.170
And if you do, then you can
pull it up and make any shape.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:05.250
But if you're not exactly
on center, as you pull it up

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:07.260
it's just going to go
wonky and fall apart.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.846
And that's what making
plays is like a little bit.

00:23:10.846 --> 00:23:12.262
But plays are much
more forgiving.

00:23:12.262 --> 00:23:13.246
But a musical--

00:23:13.246 --> 00:23:13.740
ALAN SEALES: But this
is your first musical.

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.005
LISA KRON: Yes.

00:23:14.005 --> 00:23:14.590
ALAN SEALES: Yeah.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:15.423
JEANINE TESORI: Yes.

00:23:15.423 --> 00:23:17.330
And Lisa won the Tony
on her first one up.

00:23:17.330 --> 00:23:21.085
I must say, I had to
write six musicals

00:23:21.085 --> 00:23:22.960
to get that [MUTED] award.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:23.590
But yeah.

00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:25.597
LISA KRON: Obvious we're
meant to work together.

00:23:25.597 --> 00:23:26.805
JEANINE TESORI: It's so true.

00:23:26.805 --> 00:23:29.070
We actually met
writing this musical.

00:23:29.070 --> 00:23:30.070
LISA KRON: Yeah.

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:31.000
JEANINE TESORI: And
now we're together.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.974
No, I'm just kidding.

00:23:31.974 --> 00:23:32.948
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:32.948 --> 00:23:33.922
LISA KRON: Exactly.

00:23:33.922 --> 00:23:34.430
JEANINE TESORI: I don't know.

00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:35.120
It's that clock.

00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.756
It makes me feel pressured to
say things that aren't true.

00:23:37.756 --> 00:23:39.130
ALAN SEALES: That's
more for me--

00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:40.180
BETH MALONE: What
does that clock mean?

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.210
ALAN SEALES: That's my cue
to know when to wrap it up.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.540
BETH MALONE: Oh, OK.

00:23:44.540 --> 00:23:45.310
ALAN SEALES: So I
know people have

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:46.500
to get on with their day jobs.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.280
We could sit here forever.

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.610
We'll just have a
private conversation.

00:23:48.610 --> 00:23:49.776
They can all do their thing.

00:23:49.776 --> 00:23:52.090
LISA KRON: I keep waiting
for the temperature.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.370
ALAN SEALES: OK, Google,
what's the temperature.

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:56.755
JEANINE TESORI: Super cool.

00:23:56.755 --> 00:23:57.140
Super cool.

00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:58.681
ALAN SEALES: Jeanine,
you're actually

00:23:58.681 --> 00:24:01.700
the most prolific and honored
female theatrical composer

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:03.614
in history.

00:24:03.614 --> 00:24:05.880
BETH MALONE: But can we
just remove the word female

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:08.230
from that and just talk
about how many musicals

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:11.200
she's written, and one of
the most prolific composers

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:12.940
in Broadway history, OK?

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:13.630
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.378
First of all.

00:24:15.378 --> 00:24:17.610
Thanks.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:19.410
ALAN SEALES: And mic drop.

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.730
So what was it
personally for you

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:23.750
that made you want
to work on this show?

00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:26.450
You've done so much,
your career is so vast,

00:24:26.450 --> 00:24:28.930
that what was it about this?

00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.820
JEANINE TESORI: I grew up
in the '70s, and I'm very,

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.290
you know, tall, grande, venti.

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:40.660
And that to me is me.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.270
Not as nice shoes, but we
grew up at the same time,

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.480
the same time as Alison.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.824
And I remember in the '70s and
thinking through Tiger Beat

00:24:49.824 --> 00:24:52.115
and all of that stuff that
no one here will know about,

00:24:52.115 --> 00:24:53.970
which is so frustrating.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:58.270
But I remember being Gabby's
age looking at my parents, who

00:24:58.270 --> 00:25:00.650
were interesting people.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.480
And there's a whole
inner life, I think,

00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.567
that gets stored
versus the outer life.

00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:06.650
And that's where a lot of
musicals, I think, live.

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:09.220
When you look at a lot
of things when people-- I

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.942
hate the adage, when you
can't speak anymore, you sing.

00:25:11.942 --> 00:25:13.650
I was like, I don't
know what that means.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:16.474
What I do know is that we
all have these inner lives,

00:25:16.474 --> 00:25:18.890
and when you think about your
relationship to your parents

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:23.450
right now and what it was, and
then what it was and what it is

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:26.340
and what it will be,
there are all these songs.

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:28.540
And a lot of that
genetic material

00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:30.430
is musical genetic material.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.250
We are themes and
variations of each other.

00:25:33.250 --> 00:25:34.920
There's no way not to be.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.960
And so what we tried
to do-- and musically,

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.860
when you look at classical
music does it all the time,

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.410
you take something,
a statement, and then

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.330
you rework it and you rework it.

00:25:45.330 --> 00:25:48.470
And that metaphor of throwing
the pot is exactly right.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.356
And you think of
all of the shapes--

00:25:50.356 --> 00:25:53.700
Bach did it, Mozart did it
beautifully, all of them.

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:56.530
And then at the very end,
why they call it the tonic,

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:57.560
is you come home.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.860
You come home again.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.100
And that's what musical
long form is based on.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.390
So this show absolutely
fell into the path

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:07.830
of coming home to yourself
and being changed by it,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.700
the way that "The Odyssey"
works and so much of literature.

00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:14.270
And it's such a smart
structure, this one.

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:17.250
So I was desperate to do it.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:18.920
And I felt the
pressure for it to be

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.290
really as great as the book.

00:26:21.290 --> 00:26:24.410
LISA KRON: As literary
as the book is,

00:26:24.410 --> 00:26:30.190
I think what both of us sensed--
I mean, what I have learned,

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.302
and Jeanine already
knew this, and we

00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:34.510
had a little conversation
with George Wolfe early on,

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:36.920
and he articulated
this in a way that

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.840
was extremely helpful
to me and I think to us.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.892
He said, you know, a
musical can be as complex

00:26:42.892 --> 00:26:44.350
as you want it to
be, but there has

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:50.320
to be one primal desire
that starts the engine

00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:54.800
and drives through every
single moment of the musical.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.540
And I think what we
sensed was in the book

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:00.270
and what we put
into the musical is

00:27:00.270 --> 00:27:01.630
that there's a primal desire.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.200
It's the first lines
of the musical,

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.680
Gabby comes out and sings, and
she sings it in the finale,

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.490
as you heard, and Beth is
writing it, Daddy, hey Daddy,

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.580
come here, I need you-- the
primal desire of a child

00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:17.570
to make a physical
connection with her father,

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:20.250
in this case a father
who is very withholding,

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:24.420
and that desire, which
everyone has a relationship to,

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.020
no matter who your parent is.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.270
If you didn't know your
parent, you know that desire.

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:30.920
It's a primal need.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.570
And it's in the book.

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:36.250
It's what makes people feel
the way they do about the book.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:39.901
And it's a perfect
core for a musical.

00:27:39.901 --> 00:27:42.150
ALAN SEALES: So I'm gonna
shift gears for a little bit

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.970
over to Gabby here.

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:44.554
How you doing?

00:27:44.554 --> 00:27:46.095
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO:
Good, how are you?

00:27:46.095 --> 00:27:46.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.450
ALAN SEALES: I'm good.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.620
So you came from "Matilda."

00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:50.953
You were in "Matilda" before
this, right, so some of you

00:27:50.953 --> 00:27:53.350
may have seen her as Matilda.

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.529
Wonderful job.

00:27:56.529 --> 00:27:58.820
So obviously that show has
a completely different theme

00:27:58.820 --> 00:27:59.319
from this.

00:27:59.319 --> 00:28:02.360
So for you personally,
what attracted

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.180
you to want to play Alison
in the show, small Alison?

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:09.870
Tall Alison.

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:13.790
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: It was
just such beautiful writing

00:28:13.790 --> 00:28:15.090
and music.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:20.910
And I could just imagine it
going on when I heard it.

00:28:20.910 --> 00:28:23.580
And I absolutely loved it.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.400
And I was like, I need
to invest more in this.

00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.610
I need to see what it's about.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:32.520
I just have to go
and see the show.

00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.040
I just felt very connected
to it as soon as I heard it,

00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:37.070
like it touched my heart.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:38.800
ALAN SEALES: So there
is also, I think

00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.920
one of my favorite
numbers is what

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.970
you do with Cole
Gray and Zell-- Zell,

00:28:43.970 --> 00:28:45.110
is that how I say his name?

00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.985
JEANINE TESORI: Zell.

00:28:45.985 --> 00:28:47.040
ALAN SEALES: Zell, yeah.

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.210
Zell Morrow.

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:49.820
So you have two
brothers in the show.

00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:50.140
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: Yeah.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:52.270
ALAN SEALES: And there's
this amazing dance number.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:54.376
You guys have not seen it.

00:28:54.376 --> 00:28:55.750
I mean, the show
itself is great,

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:59.820
but God, these three kids
on stage blew my mind.

00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.810
Is that your favorite
part of the show?

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:06.040
It's a showstopper I'd probably
say every night, right?

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:10.490
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: I mean, there
are a lot of show stoppers.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:11.310
But that one--

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.861
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.472
But that one especially
is very fun to get to do.

00:29:21.472 --> 00:29:23.680
ALAN SEALES: Do you look
forward to that every night?

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.680
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: Yeah.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.730
Yeah.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:28.890
I love getting to do
it with Zell and Cole.

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:29.870
They're great.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.050
ALAN SEALES: Yeah, it seems
like you guys have fun together.

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:32.341
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: Yeah, we do.

00:29:32.341 --> 00:29:33.840
Fun at the fun home.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.310
ALAN SEALES: Yeah,
at the fun home,

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:36.685
which is actually
a funeral home,

00:29:36.685 --> 00:29:37.903
for those of you who don't--

00:29:37.903 --> 00:29:38.902
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: Yeah.

00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:41.659
ALAN SEALES: Emily, you were
one of the original members

00:29:41.659 --> 00:29:42.450
of the show, right?

00:29:42.450 --> 00:29:44.250
EMILY SKEGGS: I joined
the show off-Broadway.

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:44.630
ALAN SEALES: Yes.

00:29:44.630 --> 00:29:46.240
So one of the
original Broadways.

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:49.556
And then you took a hiatus to
go film some TV stuff, right?

00:29:49.556 --> 00:29:50.428
EMILY SKEGGS: I did.

00:29:50.428 --> 00:29:51.740
ALAN SEALES: So what
have you been working on?

00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:53.860
EMILY SKEGGS: I filmed
a little guest role

00:29:53.860 --> 00:29:56.660
on the show called "Salem,"
about the Salem witch trials,

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.050
but the witches
are really witches.

00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:05.540
And then a complete turn,
I filmed a miniseries

00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.470
called "When We Rise."

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:08.760
It's going to be on ABC.

00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:11.290
If you saw the movie
"Milk," it follows

00:30:11.290 --> 00:30:13.900
three political activists who
were kind of in his periphery

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:16.890
from '72 to 2009.

00:30:16.890 --> 00:30:19.760
So they're sort of calling
it the gay "Roots."

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.885
ALAN SEALES: So it also has--

00:30:21.885 --> 00:30:22.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:26.935
--it also has the LGBT kind
of theme going through it.

00:30:26.935 --> 00:30:29.549
So what about that
attracted you to that role?

00:30:29.549 --> 00:30:31.340
Did it have anything
to do with, of course,

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:33.900
your Tony-nominated
performance in "Fun Home"?

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.600
EMILY SKEGGS: It's
kind of crazy,

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.641
because both in "Fun Home"
and in the miniseries,

00:30:36.641 --> 00:30:42.500
I play a real-life person
who I could speak with

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.560
and get to know and
study their lives

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.180
and study how they got from
one point to the other.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.790
And that's just been
kind of mind-blowing.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:55.840
I mean, to be able to
map out the arc of a life

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.210
and the main events
in someone's life

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.540
and what brought someone
from here to here

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:03.600
and the desire that made
them fight for something

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:06.240
versus something
else, is-- I mean,

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.030
I think I'm still so
much inside of it,

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.681
so I don't quite understand
the significance of it,

00:31:10.681 --> 00:31:11.680
if you know what I mean.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.100
Like, these people
are really alive.

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.310
And now we are
taking their lives

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:20.760
and showing it to other
people who are really alive.

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.132
I get very emotional
when I think about it.

00:31:26.132 --> 00:31:28.340
ALAN SEALES: What did you
say, it's a stoner thought?

00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.131
EMILY SKEGGS: Yeah.

00:31:29.131 --> 00:31:31.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:31.230 --> 00:31:34.285
Whoa, so, we're, like,
alive, and we show things

00:31:34.285 --> 00:31:36.239
to other people who
are also-- yeah.

00:31:36.239 --> 00:31:38.530
EMILY SKEGGS: But it's exciting
to honor people's lives

00:31:38.530 --> 00:31:39.324
in that way.

00:31:39.324 --> 00:31:40.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.650
LISA KRON: I said to
Alison one time, I said,

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:43.660
Alison, what is it like when
you go to other musicals?

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.810
Are you like, there's something
wrong with this musical-- oh,

00:31:45.810 --> 00:31:46.740
it's not about me.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:47.779
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:47.779 --> 00:31:48.320
I don't know.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.640
I just didn't relate to it.

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:50.473
ALAN SEALES: Boring.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.210
Gosh, I have so many questions.

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.010
But if any of you guys in
the audience have questions,

00:31:56.010 --> 00:31:57.593
there's mics here,
so start lining up,

00:31:57.593 --> 00:31:59.390
and we can go to
you guys any time.

00:31:59.390 --> 00:32:01.780
I want to skip over some
things because there's

00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:02.720
so much to talk about.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.420
So the format of
the show itself is

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.780
in the round, which, for
those who don't know,

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.870
the audience is sitting 360
degrees around the stage.

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.080
And that's very, very
unusual for Broadway.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.480
And this is now
the third staging

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:19.120
of the show, the previous
two not in the round.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:21.810
How did it get to where it
is, and why does it work?

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.320
Why did you choose this version?

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.180
Anybody?

00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:27.410
JEANINE TESORI: Yeah, Sam--

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:28.660
ALAN SEALES: Sam the director.

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.640
JEANINE TESORI: We did
it-- a thrust stage,

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.930
and then proscenium
at The Public.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:36.370
Part of it is Sam loves
working in the round.

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:38.930
Musicals are almost never in
the round because of the way

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:40.070
that sound design is.

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:43.900
You know, just think that you
have to look at someone often

00:32:43.900 --> 00:32:46.030
to be able to--
like at a concert,

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:49.650
to watch someone play you
listen to it very differently.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:53.270
And when the image is
removed from the sound,

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:54.350
it's much harder.

00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:57.440
But the sound design by Kai
Harada and the technology--

00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.570
we're at Google,
so you know, is so

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.390
amazing you can throw this
imagery onto the stage.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:05.110
And even if that person isn't
there, it's like they're there.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:07.510
And that's a whole
new age for us

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.360
at musicals, because
you can do it very,

00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.690
very differently than the
traditional proscenium

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:15.330
arch, which requires
that there is focus.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:17.070
And you can do it
really differently.

00:33:17.070 --> 00:33:20.380
It's also a memory play,
so this fits beautifully

00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:23.360
inside that idea that memory can
come and get you at any point.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:26.040
It's getting me right now.

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:29.660
So the people who are in
power are not the actors.

00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:31.490
It's the audience
who's in power.

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:33.031
ALAN SEALES: It was
interesting to me

00:33:33.031 --> 00:33:34.670
because halfway
through, I realized

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:37.490
that I felt like I was
literally inside the mind

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.620
of the storyteller.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.020
It is Broadway-sized, obviously,
it's an on-Broadway show,

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.850
but it feels very intimate.

00:33:44.850 --> 00:33:49.640
And the stage itself, there's
the living room of the house,

00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:52.060
and then there are times
when the whole furniture just

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:54.680
shifts, so we see
different sides of it.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:34:00.900
And I feel like it just worked
so incredibly well to convey--

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.400
I was reading, I won't take
credit for this terminology,

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:06.300
but the swirling of
the memories going on

00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.300
and the recollection of
the character of Alison,

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.000
because the whole
thing is a flashback.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.630
So there's no question there.

00:34:12.630 --> 00:34:15.004
BETH MALONE: But it doesn't
necessarily behave in the way

00:34:15.004 --> 00:34:18.530
that your memory play that
you're used to seeing behaves.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:22.620
So it sort of loves to make
you think you know how it works

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:24.540
and then switch
the rules on you,

00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:27.031
which is kind of-- the
thing about memories

00:34:27.031 --> 00:34:28.739
is sometimes you're
like, oh, yeah, that,

00:34:28.739 --> 00:34:30.949
and sometimes you're like, what?

00:34:30.949 --> 00:34:32.510
Oh, yeah.

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:34.159
Oh, wow, that.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:36.080
So the memories
don't come at you

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.850
and behave the same way from
memory to memory or moment

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:41.160
to moment in this play.

00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.860
And it's helpful.

00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:45.440
And also it's cranium-shaped.

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:51.600
Ultimately the circular-- it's
like the inside of your-- you

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.965
went on the amazing journey
into-- you know what I mean?

00:34:53.965 --> 00:34:55.131
JEANINE TESORI: I love that.

00:34:55.131 --> 00:34:56.489
Raquel Welch.

00:34:56.489 --> 00:34:59.300
BETH MALONE: We're
on a red blood cell.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.218
JEANINE TESORI: We are
so old, because no one

00:35:01.218 --> 00:35:01.882
knows what we're talking about.

00:35:01.882 --> 00:35:03.376
ALAN SEALES: No,
I love that movie.

00:35:03.376 --> 00:35:05.010
"Inner Space," is that
what we're talking about?

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:06.532
JEANINE TESORI: "Fantastic
Journey" with Raquel Welch,

00:35:06.532 --> 00:35:07.427
where they go in--

00:35:07.427 --> 00:35:08.760
ALAN SEALES: "Fantastic Voyage"?

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.850
JEANINE TESORI: Thank you.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:10.930
Oh my God, you have to see it.

00:35:10.930 --> 00:35:12.971
And then they get attacked
by a white blood cell.

00:35:12.971 --> 00:35:13.980
BETH MALONE: Yes.

00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:15.521
JEANINE TESORI: She
wears a jumpsuit.

00:35:15.521 --> 00:35:17.246
It's so amazing.

00:35:17.246 --> 00:35:19.170
ALAN SEALES: You had
a question over here?

00:35:19.170 --> 00:35:21.656
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
wondering, Alison Bechdel,

00:35:21.656 --> 00:35:23.805
did she participate in
the writing process,

00:35:23.805 --> 00:35:25.940
or did she just
hand you her baby?

00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:28.290
And did she like the end result?

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:30.170
LISA KRON: She
handed us her baby,

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.140
and she made herself available.

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:35.479
She gave us her journals that
she wrote-- me and Jeanine,

00:35:35.479 --> 00:35:37.520
she gave us her journals
that she wrote while she

00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.990
was writing "Fun Home."

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:45.640
And she was available to
answer our questions which

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.830
came up in the writing.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.320
But then she really trusted us.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:52.700
And it was, indeed, like
handing us her baby.

00:35:52.700 --> 00:35:57.760
And she, yes, I
think unequivocally

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:00.510
feels very positive
about the show

00:36:00.510 --> 00:36:02.340
and I think very
connected to the show.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:04.510
And on the night I think,
we opened at The Public,

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:06.270
or maybe it was
around that time,

00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:10.370
and she said, I don't
know what to do.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:11.984
She expresses her
gratitude a lot.

00:36:11.984 --> 00:36:14.400
And she said, I feel like I
should give you my first born.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.530
And then there was
this sort of pause

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.116
and we looked at each other,
and we were like, well,

00:36:17.116 --> 00:36:17.910
you did already.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.035
ALAN SEALES: You did, yeah.

00:36:19.035 --> 00:36:19.814
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:19.814 --> 00:36:21.501
Yeah, question?

00:36:21.501 --> 00:36:23.250
AUDIENCE: First of
all, thank you so much.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:24.420
The performance was amazing.

00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.530
Really appreciate it.

00:36:26.530 --> 00:36:30.360
So this is a question primarily
for the three Alisons.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.969
This is obviously a very
deeply personal story.

00:36:32.969 --> 00:36:35.260
I mean, I haven't read the
book or seen the whole show,

00:36:35.260 --> 00:36:38.347
and just those three songs were
giving me the feels back here.

00:36:38.347 --> 00:36:39.472
ALAN SEALES: All the feels.

00:36:39.472 --> 00:36:40.472
AUDIENCE: All the feels.

00:36:40.472 --> 00:36:42.250
All at the same time.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.550
But my question is, for
you guys as somebody who's

00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.200
interpreting this deeply
personal experience

00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:49.960
and then projecting
it for other people,

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.730
how do you tap into that?

00:36:51.730 --> 00:36:54.230
How do you personally
approach making

00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:57.100
that accessible to
people like me, this lump

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.630
sitting in the back of the room?

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:01.110
EMILY SKEGGS: Yeah,
I think there's

00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:03.170
a lot about the story
that's really specific.

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:08.459
But the end of the day,
it's a story about a girl

00:37:08.459 --> 00:37:10.000
and her relationship
with her father,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.230
and her relationship
with her sexuality.

00:37:12.230 --> 00:37:15.410
And I think it's pretty safe
to say that we all have fathers

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:17.310
in some way, shape, or form.

00:37:17.310 --> 00:37:20.900
And we all have some kind
of desire for other people.

00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:26.500
And so I think that just
keeping that in mind.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:29.310
And it's about empathy.

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:31.760
It's about finding a
connection with these people,

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:36.360
these real, live
people, that-- you know,

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.140
Alison has a struggle
with her father,

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:41.320
but they both have
the same struggle.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.706
Another stoner thought for you.

00:37:42.706 --> 00:37:43.380
BETH MALONE: I love it.

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.010
EMILY SKEGGS: Do you
know what I mean?

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.030
BETH MALONE: Yes.

00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.650
For me--

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:46.800
EMILY SKEGGS: It's
about connection.

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.080
BETH MALONE: Yes.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.910
EMILY SKEGGS: They
have the same struggle,

00:37:47.910 --> 00:37:49.070
but they don't know
how to talk about it.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.653
BETH MALONE: There's
a lot about being

00:37:50.653 --> 00:37:53.950
in the show that lends itself
to the actual material that is

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.540
like, I don't want to do that.

00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:56.530
I don't want to go.

00:37:56.530 --> 00:37:58.020
I don't want to
watch this scene.

00:37:58.020 --> 00:37:59.430
I don't want to watch it.

00:37:59.430 --> 00:38:02.680
I don't want to have to watch
him leave these kids in a New

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.100
York apartment
while he goes off.

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.350
I don't want to watch this.

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:07.790
And that actually is helpful.

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.170
There's a lot about
being in the show,

00:38:11.170 --> 00:38:15.780
and you have to give-- you
must give yourself over to it.

00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.560
To be in the show,
there are things

00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.620
that you're going to
not want to have to do.

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:21.890
But that's exactly the journey.

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:24.940
That's the exact
journey of Alison going,

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.250
whoa, I wanted to make
this piece of art,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.682
but I didn't know it
was going to do this.

00:38:29.682 --> 00:38:31.890
I didn't know it was going
to take me here and there.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.919
And that's the same as kind
of being in it sometimes.

00:38:34.919 --> 00:38:36.460
It's like, wow, I
really wanted this.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.260
I really wanted
to make this art.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.410
Agh, it's awful.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.000
But it's wonderful.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.040
So there's a lot of, at that
moment to moment thing, when

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.040
the show starts, da
da, da da, da da,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.610
and you just kind of
walk through that door

00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:52.870
and it just kind
of sucks you in.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.580
And the moment to moment
work of the composers

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:58.390
and the lyricists
and the book writer

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:01.320
have given us sort of a
template where we just

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.630
have to step out on
stage, and it takes you

00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:05.630
right down the road.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:08.390
EMILY SKEGGS: The material
is like a pull of honesty.

00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:09.150
BETH MALONE: Yeah.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.579
It's like there's no
fat left in this script.

00:39:12.579 --> 00:39:13.787
I did an interview yesterday.

00:39:13.787 --> 00:39:15.328
Somebody was like,
well, this version

00:39:15.328 --> 00:39:19.090
of the character-- I'm like,
there's just no character left.

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:22.210
It's all just--
it's just intention.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:23.170
That's all that's left.

00:39:23.170 --> 00:39:28.500
It's like there's no-- it's just
an elegant, streamlined person

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.310
voraciously searching for
something a minute at a time.

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:34.220
So that's all it is.

00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:39.240
LISA KRON: I think what
we're trying to do,

00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:41.330
what theater makers
try to do, is

00:39:41.330 --> 00:39:44.300
to make something that
will do what you just

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:46.070
described, is to
give an audience,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:48.190
to evoke feeling
from an audience.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.700
And it costs us something
sometimes to do it.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.030
But the thing is
made out of craft.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:40:00.970
And so what you feel
and what we have made

00:40:00.970 --> 00:40:04.580
are actually not the same thing.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:09.410
We make this sort
of vessel of craft

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:12.930
that then takes you someplace.

00:40:15.864 --> 00:40:18.030
And it should feel-- you
shouldn't think about that.

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:18.790
You should never
think about that.

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:20.570
We also want to
make you-- we want

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:23.310
to make something that is lean
in the way Beth's talking about

00:40:23.310 --> 00:40:25.880
so that you never--
the goal is for you

00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.620
to get picked up and
carried somewhere,

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:33.920
and never be thinking
about that craft.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.270
But I think what it seems
like is that what you feel

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.860
is identical to
what we are doing.

00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.660
And it's actually--

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.530
BETH MALONE: All I have to say,
what you bring to this room

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:47.272
is what "Fun Home" does to you.

00:40:47.272 --> 00:40:51.100
You sit in that seat and you
brought whatever relationships

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:54.200
you have in your life
to this viewing today.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.290
And that's the thing
you're feeling.

00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:57.550
That's what you're feeling.

00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:58.360
We do this thing.

00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.830
We do the same thing
every day, and everybody

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:01.829
was like, oh my God, the
show was about suicide.

00:41:01.829 --> 00:41:03.740
Oh my God, the show is
about mental illness.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.630
The show was about being
gay and coming out.

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:08.780
It was like, it's about
whatever it's about.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.920
You bring so much of it,
because there's so much

00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.300
empty space in the show.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:15.980
There's a lot of
room for you to fill

00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.671
in your own narrative in your
own experience in "Fun Home,"

00:41:18.671 --> 00:41:19.170
I think.

00:41:19.170 --> 00:41:22.490
It's not super busy
and rattling your mind

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:27.300
with every measure
filled with-- cram-packed

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.950
with words and beats.

00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:33.567
It's like there's emptiness
for you to show up.

00:41:33.567 --> 00:41:35.650
ALAN SEALES: We're actually
running short on time,

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:36.890
so we'll do one
more question here.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:37.160
Yeah.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:37.701
JOE: Awesome.

00:41:37.701 --> 00:41:38.910
Hi, I'm Joe.

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:40.630
I went to school for
music, and something

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.046
about the music
that really struck

00:41:42.046 --> 00:41:44.760
me was that it seemed to
combine so many different

00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:47.510
influences-- classical,
modern music.

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.070
And it wasn't one of
those musicals that

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:54.980
takes a great artist and makes a
musical out of their past work.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.270
It really invents new music.

00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:59.420
And I was wondering if you
could talk about your sources

00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.950
for that, and if you could
talk about how you approached

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:04.970
writing for three
different people, three

00:42:04.970 --> 00:42:09.670
different parts of their
life, and if the music matured

00:42:09.670 --> 00:42:11.429
in any ways that you found.

00:42:11.429 --> 00:42:13.012
JEANINE TESORI: Such
a great question.

00:42:13.012 --> 00:42:17.390
You should probably
be composing.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:20.280
Well, I have so much recall.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.280
I remember reading Judy
Blume when I was at that age,

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.780
"Are You there God, It's Me,
Margaret," and thinking, God,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.360
is this written
by an 11-year-old?

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.070
And she said that
she has this recall.

00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:33.850
And I have that.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:38.480
I have a kind of mind
that is complicated.

00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:40.410
There's a bar mitzvah
always going on.

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:45.200
But every-- I remember-- I'm
not Jewish, and I'm straight

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.860
and it's just a
problem on both sides.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:53.910
So I have so much-- my training
was so odd and wonderful that I

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.629
was trained classically, and
my piano teacher absolutely

00:42:57.629 --> 00:42:59.420
demanded-- you know,
it's interesting we're

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:03.210
talking about space,
and I had space

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:06.710
to improvise and to do lead
sheets and circle of fifths

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.090
in everything, and to play
TV themes and pop music.

00:43:10.090 --> 00:43:12.980
And I grew up speaking
four or five languages.

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.340
And sometimes people
have-- about my work,

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:19.050
they say it's pastichey or
it's eclectic, which means,

00:43:19.050 --> 00:43:19.740
you suck.

00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:21.520
In my world, that's
what it means.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.320
Trust me.

00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:25.680
But for me, it's that
idea that I am-- I

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.140
love what Beth was just
saying, that you are what

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.100
you bring to all these things.

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.810
And I find in "Fun Home," I
finally-- I didn't find it,

00:43:34.810 --> 00:43:36.120
Lisa found it.

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.420
And because I am
all of these three,

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:40.690
I should be so lucky to
be these three people.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:42.400
But we are these nesting dolls.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.910
And I feel like a
nesting doll musically.

00:43:44.910 --> 00:43:48.220
I love the Talking Heads,
and I love Stravinsky.

00:43:48.220 --> 00:43:51.980
And I loved R. Kelly
"In the Closet."

00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:54.610
I mean, all of that, all of
those things, and the beat.

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:57.380
And I was trained in
Nashville, and I finally

00:43:57.380 --> 00:44:01.260
found this place where I could
access so much of those things,

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:05.840
trying to not apologize
for being so many things,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.230
because I think a lot of women,
I don't know about people

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:11.010
in this room, were
taught, and I think told,

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:13.230
as I was, you are too much.

00:44:13.230 --> 00:44:16.410
And I said that to someone
recently, and they said,

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:19.150
you mean too much for
them, for those people

00:44:19.150 --> 00:44:20.240
who are telling you that.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:22.794
And I thought, oh, if I had
known that 20 years ago.

00:44:22.794 --> 00:44:24.186
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.170
ALAN SEALES: So Gabby,
has your relationship

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:32.890
with your parents changed
since you've been in the show?

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:35.352 --> 00:44:36.852
JEANINE TESORI:
Your mother is here.

00:44:36.852 --> 00:44:38.970
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: Yes.

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:39.980
No.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:45.500
My parents have always both
been very, very supportive of me

00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:49.020
and very, very helpful,
and that has never

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.680
changed all of my life.

00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.596
JEANINE TESORI: God,
what does that feel like?

00:44:52.596 --> 00:44:53.496
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:55.186 --> 00:44:56.310
ALAN SEALES: Good job, Mom.

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.120
Good job.

00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:01.540
So just last question here,
could be an upper or downer,

00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.780
I guess.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:05.910
You bring to it what you will.

00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:08.040
What advice would
any of you give

00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:12.620
to a child who suspects
that their parents, one

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.880
of their parents might
be gay, or a parent who

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:19.266
suspects one of their
children might be gay?

00:45:19.266 --> 00:45:21.060
JEANINE TESORI: Gabby,
why don't you start?

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.976
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO: OK.

00:45:21.976 --> 00:45:22.476
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:22.476 --> 00:45:31.850
I would say just understanding
that people have a right

00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:35.020
to be who they want to be.

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.304
ALAN SEALES: All right.

00:45:37.304 --> 00:45:38.680
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:41.560
GABRIELLA PIZZOLO:
Whoever they are.

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:43.236
ALAN SEALES: Well,
I guess that's it.

00:45:43.236 --> 00:45:45.860
All right, well, everybody give
them another round of applause.

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:47.583
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:49.998
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.380
Cool.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.490
Thank you so much.
