we don't care about and and that

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:35.500
we don't care about and and that
 

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:41.540
we don't care about and and that
therefore it's it's a question of racial

00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:41.550
therefore it's it's a question of racial
 

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:44.550
therefore it's it's a question of racial
racial outcome and clearly that is an

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560
racial outcome and clearly that is an
 

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.120
racial outcome and clearly that is an
outworn idea now except among a very

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.130
outworn idea now except among a very
 

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:52.030
outworn idea now except among a very
substantial proportion of the population

00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:56.840
 
so so there are there ways of explaining

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:56.850
so so there are there ways of explaining
 

00:11:56.850 --> 00:11:59.180
so so there are there ways of explaining
the problem there of course is that how

00:11:59.180 --> 00:11:59.190
the problem there of course is that how
 

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:01.220
the problem there of course is that how
do you use the European template to

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:01.230
do you use the European template to
 

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.980
do you use the European template to
shift to other parts of the world and of

shift to other parts of the world and of
 

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:06.890
shift to other parts of the world and of
course one of the answers is you declare

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:06.900
course one of the answers is you declare
 

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.900
course one of the answers is you declare
other parts of the world to be honorary

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:08.910
other parts of the world to be honorary

Africa but simply the middle east of
 

00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:46.570
Africa but simply the middle east of
North Africa so you could group them in

North Africa so you could group them in
 

00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.950
North Africa so you could group them in
that way now why wouldn't you do that

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:49.960
that way now why wouldn't you do that
 

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.810
that way now why wouldn't you do that
one reason you don't do it is that where

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:52.820
one reason you don't do it is that where
 

00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:56.290
one reason you don't do it is that where
do you put the narrative of Mohammed and

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:56.300
do you put the narrative of Mohammed and
 

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:04.390
do you put the narrative of Mohammed and
the rise of Islam now you could say have

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:04.400
the rise of Islam now you could say have
 

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:09.190
the rise of Islam now you could say have
a chapter on Byzantium and Islam in the

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200
a chapter on Byzantium and Islam in the
 

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.100
a chapter on Byzantium and Islam in the
East and then and tell the story of

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:12.110
East and then and tell the story of
 

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.540
East and then and tell the story of
Mohammed there in the story of

00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:13.550
Mohammed there in the story of
 

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:15.880
Mohammed there in the story of
Charlemagne and now Charlemagne but of

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:15.890
Charlemagne and now Charlemagne but of
 

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:19.590
Charlemagne and now Charlemagne but of
Constantine and then tell the story of

the conquest of Spain and so forth in

00:20:24.430 --> 00:20:24.440
the conquest of Spain and so forth in
 

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:27.130
the conquest of Spain and so forth in
the subsequent chapter you could do that

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:27.140
the subsequent chapter you could do that
 

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:32.530
the subsequent chapter you could do that
but you know nobody does it and I think

00:20:32.530 --> 00:20:32.540
but you know nobody does it and I think
 

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:34.080
but you know nobody does it and I think
the reason nobody does it that way

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:34.090
the reason nobody does it that way
 

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.130
the reason nobody does it that way
although in many ways it would make a

00:20:36.130 --> 00:20:36.140
although in many ways it would make a
 

00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:41.080
although in many ways it would make a
lot more sense is because it seems to

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.090
lot more sense is because it seems to
 

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:46.500
lot more sense is because it seems to
diminish the special character of Europe

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:46.510
diminish the special character of Europe
 

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:55.470
diminish the special character of Europe

were given the decline of all the Roman
 

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:16.150
were given the decline of all the Roman
Empire then you have the later Roman

Empire reading Thorndike's history of
 

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.910
Empire reading Thorndike's history of
medieval Europe then you have the rise

hundreds of years after its

hundreds of years after its
chronological point then you have the

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:42.410
chronological point then you have the
 

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.110

muhammadans in there so that you could
 

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.430
muhammadans in there so that you could
explain the Crusades and then that's

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:48.440
explain the Crusades and then that's
 

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.990
explain the Crusades and then that's
last you hear the Muhammadans for a long

last you hear the Muhammadans for a long
 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.120
last you hear the Muhammadans for a long
time then you got commerce and the rise

and that that of course raises raises a
 

01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:02.490
and that that of course raises raises a
question what why were they so different

question what why were they so different
 

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.910

of course in any instance where you have

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:06.920
of course in any instance where you have
 

01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:10.240
of course in any instance where you have
an invader and a defender you can argue

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:10.250
an invader and a defender you can argue
 

01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:14.280
an invader and a defender you can argue
that the invader will always have more

01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:14.290
that the invader will always have more
 

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:17.980

after all it was the the achæans who

01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:22.190
after all it was the the achæans who

attack Troy and Troy - sat there and got
 

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:29.490
attack Troy and Troy - sat there and got
attacked and so we talk a lot more about

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:29.500
attacked and so we talk a lot more about
 

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.660
attacked and so we talk a lot more about
the Greek side than we do about the

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:31.670
the Greek side than we do about the
 

01:05:31.670 --> 01:05:34.420
the Greek side than we do about the
Trojan side so they're a little bit of

01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:34.430
Trojan side so they're a little bit of
 

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:36.580
Trojan side so they're a little bit of
that although we don't talk a whole lot

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:36.590
that although we don't talk a whole lot
 

01:05:36.590 --> 01:05:38.820
that although we don't talk a whole lot
about the Japanese side in World War 2

01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:38.830
about the Japanese side in World War 2
 

01:05:38.830 --> 01:05:46.030
