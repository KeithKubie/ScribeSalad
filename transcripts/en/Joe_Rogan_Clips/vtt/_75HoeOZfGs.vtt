1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.370
The Joe Rogan experience.
I know that the,

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.400
the heart was flown in and I actually,
you know,
my,

3
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.070
my wife baby crazy is that it's something,

4
00:00:11.071 --> 00:00:15.510
it took a hard on someone's body and they put it on ice and we actually see as

5
00:00:15.511 --> 00:00:17.220
video the ice,
you know,

6
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.560
be going into the room and then the ice chest come following right afterwards.

7
00:00:22.671 --> 00:00:27.210
Yeah.
That's so crazy.
It is crazy.
It's,
I mean it's,
when I was a kid,

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.300
uh,
it would be like doctor Frankenstein,
you know,

9
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.340
they didn't start doing it to 68 and I was born in 59 so you know why they did

10
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:38.790
heart transplants in [inaudible] 68.
Yeah,
one,
yeah,

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.710
1963 in a long time.
But uh,
when I,

12
00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.930
when I was a kid would have been like Dr. Frank started be telling me something

13
00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:49.800
like that was possible.
I would say,
Oh hell no.
You're crazy.

14
00:00:49.801 --> 00:00:53.410
You're just making it up with science fiction.
But it most,

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.410
it most certainly is possible.
Well,

16
00:00:55.411 --> 00:00:58.390
do you think they're going to be able to grow your own heart?
Yeah.

17
00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.260
They're working on that right now.
Growing your own heart with stem cells.
Yeah.

18
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.920
And I,
and you know it's gonna happen,
which is crazy.
Yeah.

19
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.970
It is going to happen.
I have no doubt.
Yeah.

20
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.930
They've already grew a woman's bladder.

21
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.990
The woman had bladder cancer and they grew her a new bladder.
Wow.

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.950
Replaced her bladder.
Yep.
So the hearts coming.
Yeah.
It's coming,
man.

23
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.800
Yeah.
They're already working on the,
I think they're three d.

24
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.270
See if he can find a Jamie.
They're three d printing a human heart,

25
00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.110
and they think that they're going to be able to get to a point where they have a

26
00:01:32.111 --> 00:01:35.590
working model of a human heart like wow.

27
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.340
And put your heart in your body.
A freshie.

28
00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.750
Wow.
A new one,
which is just so crazy.

29
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:45.840
That is crazy.
Yeah.

30
00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.080
And how about for people who are amputees and things along those lines and be

31
00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.550
able to replace limbs with your own limb?

32
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.710
Actually grow you a limb in the back.

33
00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.880
Here it is.

34
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.740
The first three d printed heart made up of living human cells.

35
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.050
Yeah.
Yeah,
man.
Thank God there's people smarter than us.

36
00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.300
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
That is a heart made by universities.

37
00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.180
Uh,
Tel Aviv University.
Wow.
Heart,

38
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.770
the size of a rabbit marks the first time and attire heart has been three d

39
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:24.130
printed.
So that's a tiny one right now.

40
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.600
But complete with living cells,
blood vessels,
ventricles and chambers intact.

41
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.830
Incredible,
incredible.
Mini heart can contract,

42
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.510
but he can't yet pump out blood.

43
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.150
So they're working on all those different variables,
I guess.

44
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.360
But man in that incredible looking at doing it with a three d printing machine,

45
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:45.280
like three d printing machines freaked me the fuck out.

46
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.450
Like then that's the future.
They're gonna be able to make things.
Yep.

47
00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.010
Look at that.
Look how that works.
If you folks who haven't seen this,
uh,
this is,

48
00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:56.740
uh,
what the future is on cnet.com.

49
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.480
You can Google it and just the video of them actually creating this,

50
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:03.640
it is unbelievably fascinating.

51
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.030
