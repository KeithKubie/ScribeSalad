DEBBIE NEWHOUSE: So it's my
pleasure to introduce to you

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.220
Dr. Todd Rose.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.870
He is the director of the Mind
Brain and Education Program

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.500
at the Harvard Graduate
School of Business.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.471
He is also the head
of the Laboratory

00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:17.470
for the Science of the
Individual, which Harvard

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.930
founded because of the concepts
that he Todd and his associates

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.540
have developed.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.220
He's also the
co-founder of the Center

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.380
for Individual opportunity.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.420
So I hope this afternoon's
talk will be eye opening

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.280
and interesting to you on a
personal or professional level.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.242
So please join me in
welcoming Dr. Todd Rose.

00:00:37.242 --> 00:00:38.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:39.886
TODD ROSE: Thanks.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.205
Great, thanks for having me.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.760
Full disclosure-- I had this
terrifying dream last night

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.290
that I was up here.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.410
And then the first
thing Debbie asked so

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.150
how many golf balls fit into
a-- and I was like wait.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.522
I'm not asking for a job.

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:03.730
I'm just here to give a talk.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.489
And they said, no,
no, no, everyone

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.863
that gives a talk at Google
has to answer these questions

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:08.370
first.

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.850
And I literally
woke up drenched.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.455
So I'm assuming that's not the
case, because I would fail.

00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:15.330
And then you wouldn't
care what I had to say.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.140
So I am here just to give a
talk about my new book called

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.650
"The End of Average"
that touches on some

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.410
of the scientific
work that we're

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.700
doing around trying
to understand people

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.782
as individuals in
a scientific way

00:01:28.782 --> 00:01:30.240
and thinking about
the implications

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.740
that these insights have for
our institutions in society

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.170
all the way from education
to the workplace.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.580
And my goal is just to
frame two big things for you

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.830
at a high tops level that the
book explores in greater depth.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.270
One is this idea that seems
almost like a bumper sticker.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.540
But it has pretty deep
scientific meaning,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.270
which is there's
literally no such thing

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.150
as an average person.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.410
And yet we built our whole
society around this idea

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.920
that there is and that we can
reference ourselves against it.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.331
And then I want to just touch
on if you believe me there

00:02:04.331 --> 00:02:05.830
is no such thing
as average, and you

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.080
can't use that as a
reference point, how would we

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.480
think about individuals
in a systematic way

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.070
and introduce you to these three
principles of individuality

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.000
that we use in my
lab and other labs

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.080
to investigate people
and understand them.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.092
So just as a
starting point, I am

00:02:22.092 --> 00:02:23.300
going to tell you this story.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.960
The first time
that I encountered

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.460
scientifically the failure
of averages was back in 2002.

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:34.260
I was working at Mass General
Hospital doing brain imaging.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.340
And I was actually still
a doctoral student.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.310
So I was gung ho.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.600
And we're thinking
we're really smart.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.120
And this is how
we used to do it.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.190
And some people still do it.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.120
So if you were all
in my study, we

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.140
would take you, bring you
in, put you into a scanner,

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.070
give you a task,
scan your brain,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.110
and then this thing that we do
literally algorithmically you

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.340
just combine all of your brain
patterns into an average brain.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.125
And then we publish the results.

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:04.750
And this is just the
way we've done it.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.360
And we do it in neuroscience.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.380
But we do it in all other
fields of social science

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.480
with the assumption
that averages

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.070
would have to
represent some people

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:16.210
or else that would be kind
of silly to be using them.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.700
So here I am in 2002
doing brain imaging.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.140
And there's this paper
comes out by my colleague

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.480
Mike Miller, who's now
at UC Santa Barbara.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.570
And he's studying what was
pretty straightforward, which

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.769
is how your brain
retrieves memory.

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.560
And I say straightforward
because we've got

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.060
so many studies on this topic.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.659
And we know the areas of the
brain that retrieve memory.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:40.450
In fact, if you had
asked me back then what

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.950
we know for sure,
I would have said,

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.620
we know these brain areas
that retrieve memory.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.810
So he does this study.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.350
And he does the method
that I just described.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.340
And he gets this result. Here's
a picture of the average brain.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.290
It looks just like all
the other studies that

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.690
have studied memory retrieval.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.150
But he said he was in
those scanner sessions

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.970
just kind of watching
students run the sessions.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.060
And he happened to notice
one subject whose brain

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.290
pattern seemed a little off.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:11.932
And so he remembered
it being an anomaly.

00:04:11.932 --> 00:04:13.890
And he thought it didn't
look like the average.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.416
So he did this very
simple question

00:04:16.416 --> 00:04:18.540
that's kind of surprising
that people hadn't really

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.540
asked before.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.160
He thought, what if
I go back and look

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.570
at the individual
brains in my study?

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.870
How many of them are roughly
close to this average brain?

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.380
So here's what he found.

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.660
He goes back and looks.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.430
Here's a couple of
samples from his study.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.860
These were all people who
did the task successfully,

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.580
by the way.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.310
Here's one subject's brain.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.340
Here's another one, another one.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.570
I just used three to
give you a sense for it.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.150
You can go on and
on, because what

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.720
he found was not a
single brain looks

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.610
anything like the average.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.550
So he gets worried.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.890
So rather than
publish it, it's like,

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.820
what if you made a mistake?

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.450
That's not a good way
to start your career.

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.350
So he kind of shelves
it for a while.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.050
But then a few months
later it's nagging him.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.150
So he brings the same subjects
back roughly six months later,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.440
puts them in the same scanner,
gives them the same task,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.360
gets the same
result. The average

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.980
still represents nobody.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.210
But what was really
interesting is the way

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.080
the individual's brain was
doing the task remained

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.350
really stable.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.610
It was these patterns of
individuality that mattered.

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.234
Later on, they would figure out
that those patterns would group

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:28.510
around different strategies
that the brain is using

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.460
to recall memory-- more of a
visual anchor, spatial anchor--

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.690
verbal kind of stuff.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.530
So this pretty much
rocked all of us.

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.170
Wait a minute.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.840
What are we doing then?

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.430
And it really changed
a lot about how

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.850
we think about brains.

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.444
But what's interesting is
over the last decade or so,

00:05:47.444 --> 00:05:49.110
it's not just been
about brains anymore.

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:52.060
In every field where
we have the data

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.060
and we can look at individuals,
we found the exact same thing.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.380
So for example, there's no
such thing as an average cell.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.240
There's no such thing
as an average genome.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.420
There's no such thing
as average cancer.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.530
There's no such thing
as average performance--

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.870
everywhere we've looked.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.140
Now, this goes all the way
up to behavior and learning.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.120
So when we look at
students, we find

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.020
there's no average student.

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:17.020
There's no average employee.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.150
That's a fact.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.890
But here's the problem-- if you
take something like education,

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.920
we literally built our
existing industrial education

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.300
system on the idea of
an average student.

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.290
And if you think about for a
second, when we buy textbooks,

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.420
we literally at the
governmental level

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:38.910
say you need to design them
to be age appropriate, which

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:43.020
actually just means for
the average of that age.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:46.220
And you ever think when
we give kids tests,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.550
they're standardized
norm referenced,

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.230
it's about how they
perform compared

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.360
to a hypothetical
average student.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.930
And we fix the
amount of time kids

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.220
have to learn how long they can
take a test all in reference

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.050
to averages.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.840
Right?

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.420
So the problem is, again
scientifically, we realized,

00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.550
OK, there's no average.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:05.360
What do we do?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.180
And we know now that, by
the way, I was going to say,

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:12.979
when we think about
these systems,

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.520
people think, well, why would
we have ever built an education

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:16.580
system on average?

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.202
But it was built in
the industrial age

00:07:18.202 --> 00:07:20.410
by people who were absolutely
obsessed with averages,

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.460
because they worked
fantastically well managing

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:26.160
factories when you could
treat each individual employee

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.107
as a cog, right?

00:07:27.107 --> 00:07:28.690
Where you really
want to descale them,

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.370
and they could be
interchangeable parts.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.500
But we're stuck now
in modern society

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:39.210
with a system of education not
producing the talent we need.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.370
And we have a hard time
hiring the right people

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.160
and assessing their performance.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.209
So we're really kind of doing
some soul searching around we

00:07:46.209 --> 00:07:47.250
want something different.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.860
We want more personalized
kinds of education.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.602
So most of my work nowadays
is in personalized learning.

00:07:52.602 --> 00:07:54.060
Like, what does
that actually mean?

00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.340
How do you do it at scale?

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.750
And the challenge is that
if this was 10 years ago,

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.560
we actually didn't really
know how to do that.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.440
But I think what's exciting
and what I wrote the book

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.160
for is that today we do.

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.329
We actually have a
science not surprisingly

00:08:10.329 --> 00:08:11.870
called the science
of the individual.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.090
And it is interdisciplinary.

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:16.614
And it's basically
revolutionizing every field

00:08:16.614 --> 00:08:17.280
that it touches.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:20.320
So almost every advance
made in medicine

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.980
that's on a personal
level has come

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:25.210
from these new kind of methods
around studying individuality

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:28.210
instead of average patterns.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:31.050
In terms of human behavior,
and learning, and performance,

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:33.190
it comes down to the
science offers us

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:36.010
these three kind of principles
for thinking about you.

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.700
So if I am not going to
understand you based on average

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:42.520
or how far you deviate from
it, like, how would I know you?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.059
So the rest of the
talk, I just want

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.940
to touch on these
three principles

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.230
and give you some concrete
examples about how

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:50.240
to think about them.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.450
So the first one is
called jaggedness.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:56.720
Its simplest form is this-- all
human characteristics that we

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.940
care about are multi-dimensional
and cannot be reduced

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:03.350
to a single score ever.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:07.580
And yet, this is all we do
whether its body size, or IQ,

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.490
and stuff like that.

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:10.430
So let me tell you the
first time we realized

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.000
this jaggedness principle.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.090
It was actually
back in the 1950s.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.790
It was the first
time that we realized

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:19.790
there was no such thing
as an average body.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:22.850
And in the '50s, the
United States Air Force

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.520
had this really
serious problem, which

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:28.960
is we had just gotten
these jet powered planes.

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.930
We went from propellers to jets
that go the speed of sound.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.240
And they had enormous
performance problems.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.010
So these pilots who used to
be fantastic were now failing.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.010
And we didn't even
have enough pilots.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:43.290
So they were trying to figure
out what's the problem.

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:46.270
So the generals for a while--
they actually blamed everyone

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:47.600
they could possibly blame.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.980
They thought it was the pilots.

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.570
They literally said,
well, this generation

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:51.778
doesn't have the right stuff.

00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:53.690
They're not as good as
the World War II aces.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.189
And it turned out that the old
World War II aces were having

00:09:56.189 --> 00:09:57.510
the same kind of problems.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:59.840
So then they blamed
flight instructors.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.590
You're teaching them wrong.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.150
And that turned
out not to be true.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.599
What it came down
to was the cockpit.

00:10:05.599 --> 00:10:07.640
And let me just give you
the short version of it,

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:12.220
which is since the Civil
War, the guiding design

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.080
philosophy for the
military had been

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.540
if you want to design
something like a cockpit,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.680
you need one cockpit that
fits most people, right.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.440
And you're going to fit
every one but one cockpit

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:23.610
to fit the most people.

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:25.540
So the thinking
was this-- if you

00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.880
designed a cockpit for an
average-sized pilot, that

00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.070
would be your best choice.

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:33.860
So what they would do is they'd
take 10 dimensions of size.

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:36.420
They would calculate the
average for each dimension.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.070
And then they would expect
you to build the cockpit

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:39.720
around that.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.970
And it almost seems
like intuitively true

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:44.290
that this would be a way to
do it that would cover most

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.340
people.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.850
So they're busy doing this.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:50.030
But one guy-- this guy
named Gilbert Daniels.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.730
He's one of my favorite people.

00:10:52.730 --> 00:10:56.150
He's newly hired at
Wright-Patterson Air Force

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.580
Base, who's been
charged to conduct

00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:01.660
this massive study of
pilots to calculate a better

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:02.910
average, right?

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:05.660
4,000 pilots--
he's 23 years old.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.310
He's never been in
the military before.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:08.893
But he's brought in
because he majored

00:11:08.893 --> 00:11:09.980
in physical anthropology.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.320
So he knew how to study bodies.

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.620
And they said, OK, just
get us a better average.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.770
But he harbored this
feeling that maybe average

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:19.479
was the problem.

00:11:19.479 --> 00:11:21.270
And so he convinced
the generals to let him

00:11:21.270 --> 00:11:24.040
do a little study with data.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:26.470
So he basically asked
a simple question.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.507
Out of these 4,000
pilots, which at the time,

00:11:28.507 --> 00:11:30.590
were white males who were
picked because they were

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.120
close to average,
how many of them

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:36.680
were actually average on
these 10 dimensions of size?

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.230
And the general said,
look, it's a waste of time.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:44.360
We know like most of them
will be except for he

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.230
runs the analysis.

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.850
And he finds out zero.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:51.120
Not a single pilot was actually
average on these 10 dimensions

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.620
of size.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:53.740
In fact, less than
4% of them were

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.050
average on three
dimensions of size.

00:11:56.050 --> 00:11:59.580
So they realized really
quickly this was a design flaw.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.350
They built cockpits that
literally fit nobody.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.370
And to their
everlasting credit, you

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.200
would think for
such a hierarchical,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.060
conservative institution it
may be difficult to get change.

00:12:11.060 --> 00:12:13.187
It took him less than a
year once they convinced

00:12:13.187 --> 00:12:15.020
the general-- showed
them the data that this

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.620
was the problem
that they actually

00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:19.440
mandated you could never design
cockpits on average again.

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.290
You couldn't design
flight suits on average.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.680
You need to design
flexibly for a range.

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.590
So what's interesting
is, like, we've

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.100
known this about body
size for a long time.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:32.250
It's convenient to say
you're a size medium.

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:34.130
But there really
isn't a size medium.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:36.444
If there was some
standard medium,

00:12:36.444 --> 00:12:37.860
you wouldn't need
a dressing room.

00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.020
You'd just grab it.

00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.020
But it turns out
in this science,

00:12:43.020 --> 00:12:45.950
when we've started looking, it's
not just about physical size.

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.340
Every human characteristic
that we've looked at

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.980
shows the same kind
of there's no average.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.210
But often when I tell the
story about the pilots,

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:59.550
they think like, why
isn't there an average?

00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:01.780
There's just really short
people, and big people,

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.670
and there's a big
missing middle.

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:06.310
But in fact, let me show you
what Gilbert Daniels found

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.500
that gives you the clue
to why there's no average.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.330
These are two pilots--
not the pictures,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:14.620
those are just for fun.

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:17.190
But these are actual
body dimensions from two

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:17.840
of the pilots.

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:19.570
And this is what Daniels found.

00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:22.560
Every single one of them
had this kind of jaggedness

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:23.660
to them.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:25.820
He's be on the high
end on some things,

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.690
in the middle on
others, and then you'd

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.810
be on the low end
on some things.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:33.494
Every single pilot showed
this kind of jagged profile.

00:13:33.494 --> 00:13:34.910
And so it's like,
well, obviously,

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.910
if you designed something
right down the middle,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.130
it's going to be a bad
fit for most people.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.670
But like I said,
as we've expanded

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.440
this looking at jaggedness
to different characteristics

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:47.389
of human beings, we've
seen the same exact thing.

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:49.805
So we could do this on character
and other kind of things.

00:13:49.805 --> 00:13:52.090
But let's just talk
about intelligence.

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:54.950
So these are two
real sets of scores

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.500
from two women on the most
widely used adult intelligence

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.240
scale.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:13:59.840
Right?

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:04.150
Now, they converge on a single
score that's identical, 103.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.630
So if we don't care to know
them, it's easy if we say,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.890
well, they're the
same intelligence.

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:11.400
We can from
one-dimensionally rank them.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:14.300
Except for if we actually want
to know something about them,

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.640
if we really want to
nurture their potential,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.310
then it really matters
that one of them

00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:23.560
is better at spatial things and
poor at verbal and vice versa.

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.600
So this jaggedness
principle has lots

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.850
of implications for designs
of environments, right?

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.100
We still design on average.

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:33.110
We have lots of problems there.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.029
But often, this can
feel kind of abstract.

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:38.070
So I would give you one
personal example of where

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.810
this mattered quite a bit.

00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:44.910
So on my way to
graduate school, I

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:49.020
had to take the GRE,
which is-- and I'm

00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.090
terrible at standardized
assessments.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:55.010
So I thought, OK, I'm
going to study like crazy.

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:57.010
On Saturdays, you
take the practice.

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:59.530
And you have a
mentor and whatever.

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.360
And this guy that was
teaching the class,

00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.370
he scored perfectly on
the GRE, as you would

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.140
expect if you're teaching it.

00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:09.050
And so they have those
three-- back when I took it,

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.040
there was verbal,
quantitative, and then

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.940
they had this analytical
reasoning where it was like,

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.900
it still give me shudders,
like, Farmer John

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.504
has four rows of things, and
corn can't be next to potatoes.

00:15:20.504 --> 00:15:22.170
Then they give you
all these conditions.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.100
And they ask you
a question like,

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:26.240
if potatoes are in row
3, what's next to it?

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.390
And you're like, I have no idea.

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:31.330
So I'm practicing
all these exams.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.750
And I'm doing fine in verbal.

00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:37.820
And in the quantitative, I
cannot for the life of me get

00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:39.610
these Farmer John questions.

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:43.090
And after 10 weeks,
I have not cracked

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.440
beyond the 13th percentile.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.810
And I start thinking,
OK, I've got good grades.

00:15:47.810 --> 00:15:49.000
I've worked really hard.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.760
But I'm not going
to graduate school.

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.430
No one's accepting me with a
13th percentile score on this.

00:15:54.430 --> 00:15:57.280
So the mentor of our
class had actually

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.910
taught us a strategy for
the Farmer John thing, which

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:02.950
was very verbal-- in your head.

00:16:02.950 --> 00:16:08.920
So I, lucky as can be, two
weeks before the actual exam,

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.990
I happened to be at my
parents' home studying,

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:13.410
because I actually was married
with two kids at the time.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:16.650
And I couldn't get a
quiet time in the house.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.440
And I'm so frustrated that
I'm just like, I give up.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.250
And my dad happens to be walking
into the house at the time.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.537
He said, what's the matter?

00:16:24.537 --> 00:16:25.370
So he's an engineer.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:27.920
And he said look, this is a
degrees of freedom problem.

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.620
And I'm like, I have no idea
you're talking about, right?

00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.250
He says, but you're
doing it wrong.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.200
You have terrible
working memory.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.667
But there's a way to
visualize the task.

00:16:36.667 --> 00:16:38.750
And if you get it out of
your head and onto paper,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:39.842
you'll be better at it.

00:16:39.842 --> 00:16:41.550
So he gives me this
very simple strategy.

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:44.030
I'm like, there's no
way this can be true.

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:46.080
But it works on
the practice test.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.940
And two weeks later, I scored
by far my highest score was

00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:51.870
on the analytical reasoning.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.620
So I went to Harvard
for my doctorate.

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.911
And of course, then people
that see the score are like,

00:16:55.911 --> 00:16:58.100
Todd's very analytical.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:16:58.710
Sure.

00:16:58.710 --> 00:17:00.110
We'll go with that.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:01.550
But sometimes,
even just matching

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.782
of strategies against
your own jaggedness

00:17:03.782 --> 00:17:06.240
matters so much, because there's
always multiple strategies

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.200
to accomplish an outcome.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.910
OK, so we start with jaggedness.

00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:12.609
Again, the book dives
in deeper in terms

00:17:12.609 --> 00:17:14.369
of what this means
for how we hire,

00:17:14.369 --> 00:17:17.560
how we assess performance,
stuff like that.

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.430
The second principle is
the context principle.

00:17:20.430 --> 00:17:22.720
And simply stated,
it is that it is

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.897
meaningless to talk
about behavior or talent

00:17:25.897 --> 00:17:28.230
independent of the immediate
environment in which you're

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:29.830
behaving and performing.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:34.120
And that sounds simple except
for if you think about it,

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:35.940
we talk about
things like traits,

00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.100
as if you have something
that's the essence of who

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.640
you are that doesn't
really vary that

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.770
much in different contexts.

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:44.119
It's just a stable
part of who you are.

00:17:44.119 --> 00:17:45.660
And that's been the
way we've thought

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:49.100
about things in psychology
for a really long time.

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:51.040
But that's coming undone now.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:52.860
And I'll give you
two examples of this

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:54.940
that are some of my
two favorite kind

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.900
of studies in recent science.

00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.337
So how many of you are familiar
with the marshmallow task.

00:18:00.337 --> 00:18:00.920
This is great.

00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.800
It doesn't matter where I go.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.383
Most people have
never heard about it.

00:18:03.383 --> 00:18:05.932
It's like the study for
our generation of the pop

00:18:05.932 --> 00:18:06.640
psychology stuff.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.098
So for those of
you who don't know,

00:18:08.098 --> 00:18:10.070
here's the short
version-- simple version.

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:11.530
You bring in some toddlers.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:13.488
It's supposed to be about
delayed gratification

00:18:13.488 --> 00:18:14.620
and self-control.

00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.960
You bring in some toddlers.

00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.270
You put them in a room.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:20.110
Some adult says, hey,
here's a marshmallow

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:22.620
or we'll do a variation with
candy-- whatever you like.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.060
But we'll stick
with marshmallows.

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.950
Say, OK, here's one marshmallow.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:29.000
You can eat that now.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.649
Or I'm going to leave the room.

00:18:31.649 --> 00:18:33.940
And if you don't touch-- you
don't eat the marshmallow.

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.420
When I come back, you can
have two of them, or three,

00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.320
or whatever number you want to
do until the kid says I really

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.500
want that big pile, right?

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.400
So then what we do is the
adult leaves the room.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.360
And they'll leave
for up to 15 minutes.

00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:48.120
And you just wait.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.979
And then you put a
camera on the kid.

00:18:49.979 --> 00:18:51.770
And you just wait to
see how long will they

00:18:51.770 --> 00:18:53.880
wait before they just
eat the marshmallow.

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.930
And it's really cute.

00:18:54.930 --> 00:18:56.730
If you go on YouTube,
there's all kinds

00:18:56.730 --> 00:18:58.526
of really cute videos of kids.

00:18:58.526 --> 00:18:59.650
One kid thinks he's clever.

00:18:59.650 --> 00:19:01.350
He licks it and puts
it back and thinks

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:03.990
I haven't eaten it, which I
think he deserves a gold star.

00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.620
That's so clever, because
technically, he didn't eat it.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:09.880
But we actually think
literally how long

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.090
you wait is a measure
of self control.

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.150
And we love this study.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:14.830
And I think it's a cool study.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.810
But we have correlated it
with all kinds of things.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.560
So on average, how long you
wait as a toddler predicts

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.040
things like how well you'll
do in school all the way

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.660
through high school.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.760
Even it correlates with
socioeconomic status

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:28.520
and happiness in adult life.

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.240
We've even brought
the same toddlers that

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.670
were in the very first
study 40 years ago back

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.990
and put them in the scanner to
look at correlates of the brain

00:19:35.990 --> 00:19:37.760
to see, hey, look
this part of the brain

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:40.470
is different in people
who were better at it.

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:41.670
We're obsessed with it.

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:45.350
But we've definitely
thought of it as a trait.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:46.520
You have some self control.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.650
Some people have more of it than
others except for my colleague

00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:52.830
Celeste Kidd, who is at the
University of Rochester,

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:55.970
did what I think is the best
study on the marshmallow task

00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:57.260
yet.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.160
And it deserves really
wide recognition.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.890
Before she was a scientist, she
worked in a homeless shelter

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:04.479
for families.

00:20:04.479 --> 00:20:07.020
And when she first heard about
the results of the marshmallow

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:08.730
test, she got really
worried, because she

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.660
was thinking the kids in
this homeless shelter-- they

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.320
would definitely eat the
marshmallow like immediately.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.870
But not necessarily because
they have impulse problems,

00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.580
but because if
they didn't eat it,

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.810
some big kid or even an adult
would take it from them.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.350
So rather than just worrying,
she did this great study.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.929
And here's what she did.

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:28.470
She does the normal
marshmallow task.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:30.550
She has two groups of toddlers.

00:20:30.550 --> 00:20:33.770
But before they do
the marshmallow task,

00:20:33.770 --> 00:20:35.770
the kids get to
do an art project.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:39.150
They get a little cup that
they get to decorate and split

00:20:39.150 --> 00:20:41.490
the kids into two groups.

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:44.700
Both groups are told, hey,
here's some busted up crayons.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:46.550
You can decorate this cup.

00:20:46.550 --> 00:20:49.530
Or if you wait, I'm
going to go out.

00:20:49.530 --> 00:20:52.214
And we've got a new
art set with stickers

00:20:52.214 --> 00:20:53.380
and all kinds of cool stuff.

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.340
If you don't start coloring
yet, when I come back,

00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:57.590
you can have this new art set.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.000
And you can use that.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.010
So then in one group, the adult
comes back with the art set.

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:06.540
In the other group, the adult
comes back and says, ah,

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:10.870
I'm really sorry we
didn't have the art set.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.210
Then they give them
the marshmallow study.

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:15.200
So here's what she found.

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.180
In the group, where the
adult keeps their word,

00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.360
these kids are rock
stars of self-control.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.880
As a group, they
waited 12 minutes.

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:26.350
And most all of them
waited the full 15 minutes.

00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.683
They said to stop the study,
because these kids probably

00:21:28.683 --> 00:21:30.190
wait for a really long time.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:33.530
In the group, where the
adult didn't keep their word,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:36.600
the group waited for
about three minutes.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:39.820
And most all of them,
except for I think one,

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:42.820
ate the marshmallows
in the first minute.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.540
So what's really
interesting about that

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.350
is when you start taking
context seriously,

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.450
it challenges even
what is self-control.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:51.770
We're so used to thinking
it's something you have.

00:21:51.770 --> 00:21:54.359
But this is something about
trust in your environment.

00:21:54.359 --> 00:21:56.400
And it opens up whole new
ways to think about how

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.730
we help these kids, right?

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:00.559
We're so quick to say let's do
some training on self-control.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:02.850
Everybody is like, how about
we work on the environment

00:22:02.850 --> 00:22:04.170
a little bit?

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:07.030
So when we talk about
context, one thing

00:22:07.030 --> 00:22:11.660
that we often here-- people feel
like, OK that's probably true.

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.366
But that seems
really complicated.

00:22:13.366 --> 00:22:15.240
And it seems like it
would really make things

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.390
complex and hard to understand.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.350
And maybe sometimes
that is true.

00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:22.520
But what we find is more often
than not, when you take context

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.800
seriously, it tends to simplify.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.230
And I would give you
this one example.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.190
This is my absolute
favorite study

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:30.440
that I've seen in a long time.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:34.685
So how many of you know
the stepping reflex?

00:22:34.685 --> 00:22:36.060
OK, so here's what
it looks like.

00:22:36.060 --> 00:22:37.662
When little babies
are born, they

00:22:37.662 --> 00:22:39.620
have this really cool--
they look like they can

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:41.670
walk if you hold them upright.

00:22:41.670 --> 00:22:42.930
They have a reflex.

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:45.620
They move their feet.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:50.564
So I got married really
young, like 19, which is not

00:22:50.564 --> 00:22:51.730
good life advice for anyone.

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:54.030
But it worked for me.

00:22:54.030 --> 00:22:56.120
And I had my son Austin.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.940
And I'm not kidding.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:22:58.610
So he's born.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.710
And I'm playing around
with him at home.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:01.360
And suddenly, he
starts doing that.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:05.510
And I was so excited, I
thought he was amazing.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:07.276
He's walking already.

00:23:07.276 --> 00:23:08.650
So I called my
mom who's a nurse.

00:23:08.650 --> 00:23:10.150
And I was like, mom, mom.

00:23:10.150 --> 00:23:11.090
Austin's walking.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:12.020
She's like, what?

00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:14.160
He's like one-month-old.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.417
How is that-- and I said,
no, look, and I told her.

00:23:16.417 --> 00:23:18.750
She said, oh, look, Todd,
that's called the step reflex.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:19.810
Don't worry.

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:22.810
It will go away.

00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.480
And sure enough, about
two months of age,

00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.180
it goes away only to come back
right before he learned to walk

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:33.350
nine months like everyone else.

00:23:33.350 --> 00:23:38.982
So here's this puzzle of why a
reflex would disappear confused

00:23:38.982 --> 00:23:40.440
not just me, but
lots of scientists

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.899
for a really long
time, because there's

00:23:42.899 --> 00:23:44.190
no other reflex that does that.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:45.700
Why would it go away?

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.072
So for decades and decades,
scientists puzzled over this.

00:23:49.072 --> 00:23:50.030
And they bring kids in.

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.720
And they use this
method of averages

00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.761
to try to figure out
correlations between things.

00:23:53.761 --> 00:23:55.140
Why would it go away?

00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.500
So the best story
we had for it was

00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:59.800
that it was brain maturation.

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.540
In the 1960s, we
realized, we think,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:03.220
oh, your frontal
areas of your brain

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:05.290
mature, and they
suppressed the reflex,

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.840
and then it comes back later
under voluntary control--

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.521
really complicated explanation.

00:24:10.521 --> 00:24:11.770
But we thought we'd nailed it.

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.720
We thought we knew that
problem was solved.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.520
It gets into
pediatric textbooks.

00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:18.520
And now we know.

00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.710
If you're step reflex doesn't
go away about two months of age,

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.920
you might have brain issues.

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.870
Your brain might be
developmentally delayed.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:30.290
So we start sending kids in
for remediation based on you're

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.210
still stepping.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:34.200
So we thought we had
it nailed until one

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:36.580
of the pioneers of
this new science--

00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.570
a woman who has since passed
away named Esther Thelen,

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.210
she said, this
doesn't seem right.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.810
It seems a little too cute--
this simple story-- brain

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:44.840
maturation.

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.410
So she decides she's going to
do this very-- kids in context

00:24:49.410 --> 00:24:51.300
looking at individuals
instead of averages.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:53.360
She takes little
kids-- little babies.

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.910
She put them on treadmills.

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.736
She puts them in water.

00:24:56.736 --> 00:24:58.610
She does all these things
to vary the context

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:01.430
to try to figure
out what's going on.

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.430
And she figures it out.

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:06.480
It turns out it had nothing
at all to do with the brain.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.530
It was purely about
chubby thighs.

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.410
It turns out around
two months of age,

00:25:11.410 --> 00:25:14.629
little infants get a burst of
subcutaneous fat on the thighs.

00:25:14.629 --> 00:25:16.420
And they just can't
lift their legs anymore

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:17.753
when you hold them up like this.

00:25:17.753 --> 00:25:19.130
That's it.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:21.690
You put them in water, and
the buoyancy, they come back.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:22.690
You put weights on kids.

00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:23.660
And it goes away.

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:25.790
She figured out a precise
mathematical relationship

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.980
between body size
and fat on the legs.

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.920
She could predict
exactly when a kid's step

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.350
reflex would go away.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:34.540
So here we had this
really complicated story

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.860
about brain maturation
that we're sending kids

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.215
for remediation based
off of when it turns out

00:25:39.215 --> 00:25:41.960
to have nothing to do with
that just by taking context

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.220
seriously.

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.890
So the last one that I
just want to touch on.

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:49.974
And I think it's a
really important one.

00:25:49.974 --> 00:25:51.140
It's the pathways principle.

00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:54.780
And simply stated is that
individuals differ naturally

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.200
in the pace and
sequence that they'll

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.000
follow toward any
outcome that you want.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.129
And as a result, there are
always multiple pathways

00:26:03.129 --> 00:26:03.920
to success, always.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.400
It doesn't matter if we're
talking about learning

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.130
to walk or career progression.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:09.630
There's always more
than one pathway.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:12.090
The problem is when
you use averages,

00:26:12.090 --> 00:26:15.610
there can only ever be one
pathway-- the average one.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.250
And so we've structured school.

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.820
We've structured the way we
think about human development--

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:23.140
workplace environments, as if
there's this normative path.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.870
And that basically all you can
vary is how fast you go on it.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.520
And as a society, we
definitely have a preference.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.597
We think fast means smart.

00:26:32.597 --> 00:26:34.930
And I have to say like, if
you asked me a few years ago,

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.464
I definitely thought
fast meant smart.

00:26:37.464 --> 00:26:38.130
And we still do.

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.970
If I said, your kid
is a quick study,

00:26:40.970 --> 00:26:44.660
you'd definitely think I'm
saying they're smart, right?

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:47.540
So on average, it turns
out speed and ability

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.310
are correlated.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:52.760
But what we've found recently,
and I was really surprised

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.360
by this to be honest, that
when we look at individuals,

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.890
there actually
isn't a relationship

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.317
between speed and ability.

00:27:00.317 --> 00:27:02.650
It turns out the kid that
takes a little longer to learn

00:27:02.650 --> 00:27:05.340
something is just as likely
to master it as someone

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:07.270
who rushes through it.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.940
But there's a problem
here because in education

00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:15.480
in particular, we actually
built the system-- have you ever

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.580
wondered like, for example,
who decided how long you get

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.560
to take a standardized test?

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:25.300
It's actually the average of
the representative sample.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:27.870
That's what determines
how long you get.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:30.450
And this was baked into our
education system from day one

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:32.320
by a guy named Edward
Thorndyke, who's

00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.590
the father of
educational psychology.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.400
And he was a lover of all
things standardization.

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.720
So he had a view of
intelligence that

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.150
was it was how fast your
brain makes connections.

00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:44.170
And he thought globally,
like some brains are

00:27:44.170 --> 00:27:45.601
just better than other brains.

00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:47.350
And so when they were
trying to figure out

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:50.580
how much time to give people
to learn and make assessments,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:53.580
he figured, if you pegged
it to the average, sure,

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:55.900
the fast kids might
be bored a little bit.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.510
But at least you're
not wasting time,

00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:59.620
because kids that
would need more time

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.960
wouldn't be smart enough
to take advantage of it.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.500
So we've still carried that
legacy even into the workplace.

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.210
Like there's a
certain amount of time

00:28:06.210 --> 00:28:09.410
you get to do tasks with the
assumption that fast is smart.

00:28:09.410 --> 00:28:12.460
So I think one of the most
interesting things that's

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.190
happened-- you guys are familiar
with Khan Academy and stuff

00:28:15.190 --> 00:28:16.000
like this, right?

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.550
Self-paced learning
environments where we just

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.110
stop fixing the time
and let people vary.

00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:24.040
So what we're finding here
is just incredible actually.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.500
This is real data that
was all way back to 1980s

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:30.110
from Benjamin Bloom.

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.210
But Sal Khan is finding
the exact same things.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:35.740
In fact, his TED talk
is fantastic about this.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.522
So these are just
five kids where

00:28:38.522 --> 00:28:40.730
they're learning-- I think
this was actually algebra.

00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:44.570
And you see what they had was
this was that when the class

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:46.040
exam was supposed to be.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.730
So they give them a kind of
arbitrary time to give an exam.

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.150
And you can see these
kids kind of rank out.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:53.150
This kid at the bottom,
he's definitely not

00:28:53.150 --> 00:28:54.260
doing very well, right?

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.200
32%.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:57.240
Like, if we just stop
there and say, OK, this

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.970
is what you know about
this topic, right?

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:04.187
But because the study gave more
time for some self pace, what

00:29:04.187 --> 00:29:05.770
they found was that
actually, in fact,

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.660
this kid ended up with the
best score in the class.

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.080
And this has been
replicated over

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.610
and over again
the second we stop

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.474
fixing the amount of
time kids have to learn.

00:29:14.474 --> 00:29:16.640
It turns out that there's
just not that relationship

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.600
between pace and ability.

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.240
In the book, I go into greater
detail on different pathways

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.630
things in everything from
cancer to actually workplace

00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:25.080
environments.

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.000
But I want to end,
because there is

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.930
a reason I wrote the book,
which is as a scientist,

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.880
I had this naive belief.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.950
We know that averages don't
work to understand individuals.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:40.330
We know we have
a better science.

00:29:40.330 --> 00:29:42.860
We know we have principles
of individuality that

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.300
give us a better foundation.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:49.100
So I sort of thought being
right would be good enough.

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.150
We've got the data.

00:29:50.150 --> 00:29:51.910
So it's just a matter of time.

00:29:51.910 --> 00:29:55.140
But I decided to write the
book when I read this story.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.160
So it's not enough to be right.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.912
So it turns out that the
Air Force wasn't actually

00:30:01.912 --> 00:30:03.370
the first group to
figure out there

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:06.960
was no such thing as
average body size.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.580
Seven years before that, the
head of American Gynecological

00:30:11.580 --> 00:30:14.650
Association decided
to create a statue

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:19.530
of the normal average
American woman.

00:30:19.530 --> 00:30:20.760
Dickinson is his name.

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:25.040
So he gets data from 18,000
women on a whole bunch

00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.140
of different dimensions.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.490
And he crafts the sculpture.

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:28.690
And he calls her Norma.

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.527
And that's the sculpture.

00:30:30.527 --> 00:30:32.610
If you want to come see
one of the versions of it,

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.270
Harvard Medical School
has a copy of it.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:39.570
This caught on like
wildfire with the public.

00:30:39.570 --> 00:30:40.700
It was crazy.

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.370
She was shipped around
to different talk shows.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:46.045
It was an obsession.

00:30:46.045 --> 00:30:49.410
And the obsession peaks when
they decide to have a contest

00:30:49.410 --> 00:30:52.060
to find Norma.

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.630
So in the newspaper, they
start having this thing--

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.260
they tell women send us your
measurements on these nine

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.360
dimensions of size.

00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.550
And you could win $100 war bond.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:02.349
And they're so convinced.

00:31:02.349 --> 00:31:03.640
It was kind of gimmicky, right?

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.056
But they were so
convinced there'd

00:31:05.056 --> 00:31:08.190
be thousands of
women who were Norma

00:31:08.190 --> 00:31:10.680
that they had these elaborate
explanations for what to do

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.344
and when there are
these 1,000 women.

00:31:12.344 --> 00:31:14.010
How do you decide who
gets the war bond?

00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:15.960
And the YMCA was supposed
to be the arbiter

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.300
of the final measurements
and everything.

00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.670
So they go through
this whole contest.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:24.460
And it turns out
they named a winner.

00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:27.050
Her name was Martha Skidmore.

00:31:27.050 --> 00:31:28.800
And she was actually
only average on three

00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:31.900
of the dimensions.

00:31:31.900 --> 00:31:33.570
It turns out just
like the Air Force,

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:35.410
they found there was
literally no such thing

00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:37.095
as an average female body size.

00:31:37.095 --> 00:31:39.470
And these were women who
thought they were average enough

00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.303
to be willing to send
their measurements in.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.000
So here's the thing--
when they found out

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.510
this information
instead of realizing

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:53.930
that the whole idea of an
average body was nonsensical,

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:58.860
the head of the study, Bruno
Gephardt, goes to the public

00:31:58.860 --> 00:32:02.240
in the newspaper and says, look,
I know what the problem is.

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.300
American women are
profoundly unfit.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:10.390
And he said, the answer
to that is more exercise.

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.610
And they instituted PE programs
where young high school

00:32:14.610 --> 00:32:19.140
girls were asked to measure
their dimensions against Norma.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:23.830
And they were given PE
exercises to match that.

00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:26.000
So for me, this
story was important

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.990
because I realized they had the
same information that the Air

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:31.640
Force had.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.390
And yet the interpretation
was completely different.

00:32:35.390 --> 00:32:38.045
So I wrote the book
because I think

00:32:38.045 --> 00:32:39.920
we live in this really
interesting time where

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.740
we can collect unprecedented
amounts of data on individuals.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:46.990
And especially in
an area where I'm

00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:49.100
at in personalized
learning, we just

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.815
assume that if we collect
more data, we're on our way

00:32:52.815 --> 00:32:54.940
to understanding individuals
and that we'll somehow

00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:58.280
use it in a way that
does really good things.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.270
But if the Norma
story is any guide,

00:33:00.270 --> 00:33:01.960
that's just not a guarantee.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:04.050
The interpretation
really matters.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:05.880
And we're still
stuck as a society

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.160
with this mindset of averages.

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:10.110
We're so used to seeing
ourselves as a type

00:33:10.110 --> 00:33:12.490
or how far we deviate
from the average,

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.010
that defines almost everything
about how we see ourselves--

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:17.560
how we see our kids, how
we see our colleagues.

00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:19.780
And I'm completely
convinced that unless we

00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:22.779
get past that mindset and
think about individuality,

00:33:22.779 --> 00:33:24.320
we're not going to
be able to exploit

00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.790
the data and the technologies
that give us a chance

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:29.090
to have better learning
environments for all better

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.330
hiring practices, better
performance reviews.

00:33:31.330 --> 00:33:33.580
So that's the point of the book.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.340
Try to have a conversation with
the general public about how

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.930
we see ourselves as people
and what that means for how

00:33:38.930 --> 00:33:40.380
we build social institutions.

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.142
So thank you for having me.

00:33:42.142 --> 00:33:43.922
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.000
AUDIENCE: If averages
are not useful,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.746
which I think you've made a
really compelling case there,

00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:56.242
what do we use in its place?

00:33:56.242 --> 00:33:57.460
Percentiles?

00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:00.010
TODD ROSE: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:34:00.010 --> 00:34:04.850
So I think it's important
to clarify too-- averages

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:06.570
are useful sometimes.

00:34:06.570 --> 00:34:10.260
So even the very idea
of the average man,

00:34:10.260 --> 00:34:13.030
which I lay out in my book,
like the origin of that.

00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:17.540
One guy came up with this
average man in the early 1800s.

00:34:17.540 --> 00:34:20.550
It gave rise to insurance
for the first time.

00:34:20.550 --> 00:34:24.040
So averages are really
useful, and even percentiles,

00:34:24.040 --> 00:34:27.659
when what you care about is
the population-- the group.

00:34:27.659 --> 00:34:30.429
But the second you want to know
something about one person,

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:32.080
they actually fail to predict.

00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.780
So from the science
standpoint, we actually

00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.260
have a strong view that
actually understanding is never

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:41.110
comparative, right?

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:44.560
You don't really know much by
comparing it to something else.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:46.880
So what we try to
do is take these

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:49.270
what we call these
principles of individuality

00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.295
and look for
individual patterns.

00:34:51.295 --> 00:34:52.920
And then we can group
from that, right?

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.040
We can find clusters
that make sense.

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:56.870
But that's our approach.

00:34:56.870 --> 00:34:59.446
Yeah, and it's funny, because
the percentile thing--

00:34:59.446 --> 00:35:01.320
there's a sense that,
well, if we've just got

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.870
better and better percentiles.

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:06.900
But you're still dealing
with average and deviation.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.670
AUDIENCE: I think
it's very clear to me

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.960
how individual learning
can be implemented

00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:13.440
in online learning like
in the Khan Academy

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.400
or even I think Harvard
has a program called

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.680
HBX and those online courses.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.800
But how do you think
it will be implemented

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.520
in general education?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:26.750
Because most of education--
also the normative institutions

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:28.969
that actually give
you a document saying

00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:31.260
you have a degree and actually
that enables you to have

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.760
a career-- don't lend
themselves as easily

00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:36.054
to individual learning.

00:35:36.054 --> 00:35:36.720
TODD ROSE: Yeah.

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.880
It's a great question.

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.960
So that's actually
like the thing

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.150
that keeps me up at night.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.750
And we it's why I started the
nonprofit called the Center

00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:49.236
for Individual Opportunity.

00:35:49.236 --> 00:35:50.860
And we have a Beyond
Average Initiative

00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:54.040
that's solely focused
on taking these ideas

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:57.870
and trying to create scalable
solutions in education.

00:35:57.870 --> 00:36:00.580
So when I first started
writing the book and start

00:36:00.580 --> 00:36:03.210
thinking about it, I
thought we have these ideas.

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:05.710
But the solutions would
be a long way off.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:07.140
It would just take a long time.

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.590
But what's been really
surprising to me, especially

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.180
in the education space,
is that there are actually

00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:16.000
all kinds of really
innovative solutions

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.695
that are already out there.

00:36:17.695 --> 00:36:19.320
But they're on the
fringe of the system

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.420
right now, because you
still have a system that's

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:22.410
based on averages.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.330
So it's hard to see the
value of these things.

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:30.480
But my bet is this--
so you have to rethink

00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.950
some basic fundamental things
about the education system.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:37.690
If it's in K through
12, you simply

00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:40.440
can't have age-based cohorts.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.800
You just can't.

00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.709
But what we're seeing
a shift toward-- that

00:36:44.709 --> 00:36:46.500
feels like, oh, that
we really complicated.

00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.166
But you can actually
easily group people

00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:52.050
by where they're at in their
progression on any given topic.

00:36:52.050 --> 00:36:54.600
And we've seen
this-- funny enough,

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.614
we've seen evidence
of this for 100 years.

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:58.280
The San Francisco
Normal School actually

00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.840
did a complete individualized
bricks and mortar

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:07.300
approach that was really
fantastic in the early 1900s.

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.790
But I think to do
it at scale, there's

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:13.180
no getting around the fact you
absolutely need the technology.

00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:15.300
And that would be a
bad thing in the past

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.340
when the barrier to
entry for that technology

00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.600
was pretty high.

00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:22.520
But the truth is-- a good
HTML5-enabled browser

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.870
actually does
everything we need to do

00:37:24.870 --> 00:37:26.810
this kind of deep
personalization.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:30.070
So most of our focus
now is on making sure

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.860
that we don't allow
the technologies that

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.276
are being brought
into the schools

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:36.799
to be like walled gardens, which
is usually the business model.

00:37:36.799 --> 00:37:37.340
Come in here.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.850
And we'll let you inside
our beautiful thing.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:42.690
And so we're really
pushing to make sure

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:44.590
that we have these
open environments

00:37:44.590 --> 00:37:47.780
and open to resources that
are the utility of the system.

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:49.290
But I actually
think we're not that

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:51.730
far off, because I think
most people realize they

00:37:51.730 --> 00:37:54.050
want personalized learning.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:58.770
And my final piece, I would
say, is in higher education,

00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.990
which is obviously where
I reside, the push is flat

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:06.110
away from fixed-time
grade-based learning,

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:07.510
which is kind of weird.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.070
I have two sons.

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:10.760
They're both in college now.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:13.860
So it's ridiculously expensive.

00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.250
But I think like, wait a minute.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:19.422
They're in robotics
and computer science.

00:38:19.422 --> 00:38:20.880
And they come back
and say, well, I

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.250
took my little semester.

00:38:22.250 --> 00:38:24.220
And this is the grade I got.

00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:25.310
I think, wait a minute.

00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:26.674
That's not what I'm paying for.

00:38:26.674 --> 00:38:29.090
I'm not paying for you to go
there and say, OK, time's up.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:31.750
Now, how did you compare to
the people sitting next to you.

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:34.060
You're there to master
things that you can then

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:35.475
get the job that you want.

00:38:35.475 --> 00:38:37.100
So I think what we're
seeing, and we're

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:40.370
seeing this-- the higher ed
price point is just pushing us

00:38:40.370 --> 00:38:44.080
toward this-- but toward
credentials, micro credentials,

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.310
that you can stack
and create, and

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:48.930
competency-based measurements.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.310
I think that's going to
go first and pretty fast

00:38:51.310 --> 00:38:53.610
just because of the
economic incentives.

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:56.350
AUDIENCE: So as we're
starting to design more

00:38:56.350 --> 00:38:58.980
personalized learning
opportunities, or products,

00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:01.170
or whatever.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:03.710
Obviously, especially
in the beginning,

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:06.590
we won't be able to make every
single thing individualized.

00:39:06.590 --> 00:39:08.250
So how do we start
to make trade-offs

00:39:08.250 --> 00:39:13.570
of where we should put our
efforts for customization?

00:39:13.570 --> 00:39:16.050
TODD ROSE: Yeah, that's
a really great question.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.590
So when I think
of personalization

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.680
from this individuality
standpoint,

00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:23.550
it really comes down to a
combination of flexibility

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:25.590
and adaptability.

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:28.590
And I think we get really
obsessed, especially

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:31.650
in the startup space, with
the adaptability thing, right?

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:33.400
So we're going to
figure out the algorithm

00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:34.941
that we'll know
right where you're at

00:39:34.941 --> 00:39:37.250
and will adjust things
to you, which is great.

00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:39.060
But the flexibility
issue is actually

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:40.910
a pretty important one.

00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:44.750
If you design really narrow
environments, on average,

00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:47.270
I think in school, it's
called age appropriate.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:49.365
We literally incentivize that.

00:39:49.365 --> 00:39:50.240
Like, yay, he did it!

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:52.510
He made a cockpit that
fits nobody, right?

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:54.570
Then you create all
kinds of friction

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:58.140
that actually makes it harder
to do good adaptability.

00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:00.410
And so I think
the first place is

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.580
in ensuring your designing to
the edges-- really thinking

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.030
if it's your customer base.

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:07.696
And I'm probably
preaching to the choir.

00:40:07.696 --> 00:40:09.510
But you know who
your audience is.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:12.090
And you know the range
of characteristics.

00:40:12.090 --> 00:40:13.030
They're different.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.290
There's a reason why Google
has Google Translate.

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:17.310
It's not to be nice, right?

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:19.370
It's like you've got
to get people-- you're

00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:21.910
trying to get right good ads.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:26.560
But even just that-- the ability
to deal with the language

00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:29.400
barrier to allow people
to be in the common space

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.397
and have that conversation
is phenomenal.

00:40:31.397 --> 00:40:32.980
So I think thinking
about the same way

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.450
with a cockpit design thinking
about designing to the edges

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.520
for characteristics that matter
and creating the flexibility.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.140
The second piece to that is
I think from an education

00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:48.240
standpoint, our bet is
on empowering students

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.860
with the kind of
self-knowledge to make choices

00:40:50.860 --> 00:40:52.121
on their own behalf.

00:40:52.121 --> 00:40:53.870
And this new science
I think has something

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:54.911
to say about that, right?

00:40:54.911 --> 00:40:57.539
If I try to teach that you
can know yourself as a type--

00:40:57.539 --> 00:40:59.580
I'm a gifted student, or
whatever-- it's just not

00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.080
good enough.

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.350
It doesn't tell you enough.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.060
But if kids know
they're jagged profiles.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:04.810
They know the context
in which they thrive

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:06.490
and in which they
struggle-- and they

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:09.210
understand how to make
choices-- I think that gets us

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.087
even closer to personalization.

00:41:11.087 --> 00:41:13.420
AUDIENCE: I have a question
that just popped in my head.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:17.600
Suppose, I don't know, this
individualized learning gets

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.030
implemented and whatnot,
how do you measure

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.070
the success of such a system?

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:23.910
Do you use averages?

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:24.650
Is that OK?

00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:26.270
I don't know.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:29.450
TODD ROSE: That's a great
question to pop in your head.

00:41:29.450 --> 00:41:33.210
So, again, I think what's
going to be so important.

00:41:33.210 --> 00:41:38.570
And I, in my love of all
things individuality,

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:40.520
I often have to
stop and say, again,

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:42.064
there are places for averages.

00:41:42.064 --> 00:41:44.230
So if I want to know how a
school district is doing,

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.810
actually, averages and other
parameters are really valuable.

00:41:48.810 --> 00:41:52.290
What's funny about
knowing how well someone's

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:57.330
doing and performing
in these systems--

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:59.580
often people think, well,
if you don't compare kids

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.220
to other kids, how
would you know.

00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:04.467
That doesn't tell us
anything, actually.

00:42:04.467 --> 00:42:06.050
You could have a
whole class of people

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:07.030
who aren't doing very well.

00:42:07.030 --> 00:42:08.570
But I'm the best
of the people that

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:10.550
aren't doing very well, right?

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:12.050
So actually most
of what we're doing

00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:13.716
is getting toward
competency-based stuff

00:42:13.716 --> 00:42:16.857
where we clearly define
outcomes like what is it

00:42:16.857 --> 00:42:18.690
that they're supposed
to learn and how would

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:21.100
we know when they're on that
path and in their learning?

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.170
And you just keep benchmarking
them against those competency

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.974
progressions.

00:42:24.974 --> 00:42:27.140
Don't have to know anything
about how anyone else is

00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:28.540
doing to know that.

00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.490
And by the way, I actually
think in a higher ed position,

00:42:32.490 --> 00:42:35.830
competency-based stuff is so
much better for employers.

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:37.430
Like, what a fuzzy signal.

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:40.490
I have a diploma--
a four-year diploma,

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:42.700
and I got like a 3.2
or something like that.

00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:44.510
What does that mean?

00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:47.860
Versus, I have
these competencies.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:51.090
I think it's a much
better place to be.

00:42:51.090 --> 00:42:55.000
AUDIENCE: So Finland has a very
unorthodox education system.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.370
They've removed all their
national certification testing.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.409
They don't do homework.

00:43:00.409 --> 00:43:01.700
They do a lot of unique things.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.510
And they found that
the students score

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.910
like-- I guess the way they
assess their output has gone

00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:12.590
really high across the world.

00:43:12.590 --> 00:43:17.370
Do you have any insight to the
US public education system?

00:43:17.370 --> 00:43:20.260
And is there any
trends of trying

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.950
to remove some of these
traditional systems that are

00:43:23.950 --> 00:43:26.540
in place in the public systems?

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.710
TODD ROSE: So we've
struggled-- what's

00:43:28.710 --> 00:43:30.830
interesting about
the US, even if we

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:33.550
use standardized, traditional
metrics to compare

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.710
global rankings and stuff, is
we get obsessed with ranking

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:38.490
ourselves on average.

00:43:38.490 --> 00:43:41.270
Oh, on average, the
US is falling behind.

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:43.270
And Finland, by the way,
deserves all the credit

00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.811
in the world.

00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:46.930
They do really innovative stuff.

00:43:46.930 --> 00:43:48.940
But what's interesting
about the US--

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:51.190
and I'll tell you where I
think we're going with this.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:55.340
But if you
disaggregate the data,

00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:01.100
and you just look at the
schools in which there's

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:05.510
10% or less poverty, which is
actually about where Finland

00:44:05.510 --> 00:44:08.140
is in general, right?

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:10.210
I think the last I
remember-- we're actually

00:44:10.210 --> 00:44:12.650
those schools which are a
substantial number of schools

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.582
are actually the
best in the world.

00:44:14.582 --> 00:44:16.790
And then if you look at the
schools for which poverty

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:20.340
is 10% to 25%, we're
third in the world.

00:44:20.340 --> 00:44:23.950
It's just that we have
schools that are literally 90%

00:44:23.950 --> 00:44:25.360
poverty, 95% poverty.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:27.970
And they score really poorly.

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.800
So first of all, I think
averages mislead us even

00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:33.760
in how we think about
how we do as a country.

00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:36.394
And it leads us to allocate
resources in the wrong way,

00:44:36.394 --> 00:44:37.810
because this is
just fundamentally

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:43.170
about the inequitable position
of access to good resources,

00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:44.630
right?

00:44:44.630 --> 00:44:47.380
But what I think is
interesting is that in state

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.970
after state now, there's
an acknowledgment

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.170
by the secretaries of education
that the system just flat

00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:54.220
out doesn't work.

00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:55.920
It's no longer
enough just to try

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:58.700
to optimize an old
industrial system

00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:01.690
and call it a win
on average, right?

00:45:01.690 --> 00:45:05.450
In fact, the whole
model of education

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:06.900
can't be batch
processed anymore.

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.274
So the thing we're
all struggling

00:45:08.274 --> 00:45:11.830
with in the public school
system is how do you

00:45:11.830 --> 00:45:14.840
convert a system that literally
was meant to know as little as

00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.060
possible about any one kid?

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:21.020
And it was meant to produce
standardized workers-- that

00:45:21.020 --> 00:45:23.770
was the goal-- to one that's
more of a development model

00:45:23.770 --> 00:45:26.360
where we need to grow talent.

00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.830
So that's where
we're at right now

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:32.550
and where I'm actually
pretty optimistic frankly,

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:35.130
because we've got an economic
imperative like companies

00:45:35.130 --> 00:45:38.260
are just flat out-- we're not
producing the talent we need.

00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:40.690
There's a moral imperative
here around the purpose

00:45:40.690 --> 00:45:41.620
of education.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:43.710
And we now have the
technology and the science

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.430
to actually do this at scale.

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:50.140
So what we're really focused
on is connecting this science

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:52.230
to the practice
of personalization

00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.360
and trying to develop
what I would call

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:57.150
the utilities of
the system-- things

00:45:57.150 --> 00:45:59.970
that you want everyone to have
access to that can't really

00:45:59.970 --> 00:46:01.790
be monetized and
making sure we're

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.440
building it in a way
that's equitable.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:07.240
But I think you're going to see
some really innovative things

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:10.315
out of the public school
system over the next decade.

00:46:10.315 --> 00:46:11.690
AUDIENCE: It's
illegal in Finland

00:46:11.690 --> 00:46:14.760
to have private school systems
that basically is a business.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.270
And they trying to make money.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.930
So what that allows them to
do is every school is public.

00:46:18.930 --> 00:46:21.350
And every school-- I guess
you can consider average.

00:46:21.350 --> 00:46:23.530
But every school is
considered the same.

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.870
So you don't have areas that
have high-scoring schools where

00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:30.330
these well-off
people may move to.

00:46:30.330 --> 00:46:32.970
And then you develop
pockets of poverty

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:34.540
to address what you're saying.

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.630
And those become your
lower-scoring schools.

00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:41.960
So every school is the same
output of education in Finland.

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.770
And I don't know how
the US could get away

00:46:43.770 --> 00:46:46.256
from monetizing and
making school a business

00:46:46.256 --> 00:46:47.130
with private schools.

00:46:47.130 --> 00:46:49.570
But that's how I think how
Finland's attacked the problem.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:51.310
TODD ROSE: Yeah, and
I think that what's

00:46:51.310 --> 00:46:53.800
really important about this
is-- so Finland has absolutely

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.720
just nailed this industrial
model in an equitable way.

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.477
And if you talk to
leaders of Finland,

00:47:00.477 --> 00:47:02.560
I think their biggest
concern is they're trapped--

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:04.730
it's like golden handcuffs.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:06.460
They're trapped by
these rankings now.

00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.959
And they're like,
no, we were trying

00:47:07.959 --> 00:47:10.660
to not have this system that
is so captured by rankings.

00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:13.950
But now, everyone is like,
yay, we're number one.

00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:17.200
So don't change anything, right?

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:21.150
But I think that the thing that
we need to learn from Finland,

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.590
and that we have a choice to
make I think in the next five

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.630
years that these things
are going to be decided,

00:47:25.630 --> 00:47:29.330
is in our-- capitalism
is fantastic as a method

00:47:29.330 --> 00:47:31.590
if you realize it's
just a method, right?

00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:32.952
It's not the value.

00:47:32.952 --> 00:47:34.660
Otherwise, it would
just use child labor,

00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.420
because it's way more efficient.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.770
You have values to the society.

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.047
And then you let
capitalism do its work.

00:47:40.047 --> 00:47:41.630
We're not going to
go away from having

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:43.940
schools be able to be private.

00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:45.790
That's free enterprise.

00:47:45.790 --> 00:47:48.640
But here's what we can do.

00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:51.430
Right now we're making
decisions about the architecture

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:53.340
of the new digital
learning environments that

00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:55.510
will be deployed everywhere.

00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:57.900
It's just cheaper than
print textbooks now.

00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:59.970
So every company is
going this direction.

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:02.060
So we get a once in
a lifetime chance

00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.550
to define the parameters
of that system.

00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.330
So one thing that
we're betting on

00:48:06.330 --> 00:48:08.230
is we think, look,
we love startups.

00:48:08.230 --> 00:48:10.520
But start up business
models are not about equity.

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:13.140
You're not going-- equity
in a different way probably.

00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:15.780
But you're not going to say, how
do we make the decisions that

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.920
are better for everyone versus
how do we capture enough

00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.380
of the market to make money?

00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.470
So what we're
betting on is this--

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.470
If we go back to the
view of like-- back

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:29.950
in the day with browsers
when Microsoft was dominating

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:30.960
with Internet Explorer.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:33.180
And they were trying to
monetize that, right?

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.890
And they really were winning.

00:48:34.890 --> 00:48:38.440
And frankly folks like
Google and other places

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.160
realize, OK, you're not going
to beat Microsoft if you're

00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.440
going to monetize browsers.

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.898
So what do you do?

00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:47.390
I think you have given a
billion dollars to Mozilla

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:50.840
over the years to build Firefox.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.139
And say, let's not
monetize the browser.

00:48:54.139 --> 00:48:56.180
Let's make it open source
and make it phenomenal.

00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.600
And then, look, if
Microsoft can make

00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.060
something that's better
than that, then maybe

00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:00.018
people will pay for it.

00:49:00.018 --> 00:49:02.410
But it turns out, it's
really darned good.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:04.340
And you can monetize
other things.

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:06.010
So I think the most
important thing

00:49:06.010 --> 00:49:08.260
we're going to do right
now with this technology

00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:10.637
is say, look, we want
people to make money,

00:49:10.637 --> 00:49:12.720
but they've got to make
money on the right things.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:15.590
So let's put the utilities
of the system in place,

00:49:15.590 --> 00:49:18.400
make them free and fabulous,
and then incentivize

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.050
the right kind of outcomes.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:21.550
So that's what keeps
us up at night.

00:49:21.550 --> 00:49:23.758
How do we make sure we're
bringing this in and making

00:49:23.758 --> 00:49:25.800
those choices that
create a foundation that

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.504
can be excellent and equitable?

00:49:28.504 --> 00:49:30.920
DEBBIE NEWHOUSE: So thank you
so much everyone for coming.

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.150
Thank you, Todd, for
being with us at Google.

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:36.780
You brought us a lot of
thought-provoking ideas

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.676
and I think areas where
we can take action.

00:49:38.676 --> 00:49:40.290
And I do recommend
reading the book.

00:49:40.290 --> 00:49:41.610
It has a lot more examples.

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:45.380
And it has some that are
more closely associated

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:48.830
with product decisions, things
about personnel and talent

00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:51.970
that I'll think you'll find
really intriguing and also,

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.940
some good ideas to
understand yourself

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:55.870
and the people in your
family better as well.

00:49:55.870 --> 00:49:57.270
So thank you again, Todd.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:58.690
TODD ROSE: Thanks for having me.

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:00.990
