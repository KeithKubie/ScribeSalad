00:00:02.817 --> 00:00:04.150
SAURABH MADAAN: Hello, everyone.

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:05.233
My name is Saurabh Madaan.

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:06.940
And I'm very happy
to welcome you

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.150
all to the next talk in
our investing series.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.490
I couldn't be more pleased than
to have here in person none

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.710
other than James Grant.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.440
Mr. Grant has a lot of
accolades and accomplishments

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.880
that I'm going to talk about.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.830
But just to give you a
little bit of a flavor,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.119
he has a fantastic personality
and a charm with one-liners.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.480
He comes up with them magically.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.840
So before this talk, we came
here to this room for the talk.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.680
He was telling me, he said,
I'll explain investing

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.740
to you in ones and tens.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.370
And he said,
brilliant investing is

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.150
when everybody agrees with you.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.720
And he paused for like five
seconds and said, later.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.930
And today is going
to share with us

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.280
a tale of what he calls
the forgotten depression.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.140
The forgotten depression
tells of the slump of 1920

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.300
and '21, with high unemployment,
collapse in commodity prices,

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.070
upsurge in bankruptcies, and
a sharp break in stock prices.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.850
Unlike the Great
Depression, the 1920 affair

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.920
was over in 18 months.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.210
What do you think the
Federal Reserve did?

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.186
How much did they lower
interest rates by?

00:01:39.186 --> 00:01:43.260
Well, the fact is they
actually raised interest rates.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.160
And this is puzzling, right?

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.210
What explains the brevity
of this depression,

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.860
considering the actions
of the policymakers?

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.300
And Jim is here
to help in person,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.550
to help us unravel
and deconstruct

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.300
what really happened
behind the scenes.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.979
So Mr. Grant, James Grant,
is the founder and editor

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.090
of Grant's Interest
Rate Observer,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.170
a twice monthly journal
of financial markets.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.600
He is the author of
works of history.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.120
Example-- "Money of the
Mind: Borrowing and Lending

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.840
in America from the
Civil War to Michael

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.910
Milken," and biographies.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.490
Another example, "John
Adams: Party of One."

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.590
His journalism has appeared
in the "Wall Street Journal,"

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.290
the "Claremont Review of
Books and Foreign Affairs."

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.200
His television appearances
include "60 Minutes,"

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.790
"Charlie Rose," and a 10-year
stint on the "Wall Street Week"

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.460
with Louis Rukeyser.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.570
So without any further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.558
please join me in welcoming
the one and only James Grant.

00:02:53.558 --> 00:02:57.382
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.772 --> 00:03:01.520
JAMES GRANT: Well, I thank you.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.205
And I thank Google, and I
thank the worldwide television

00:03:05.205 --> 00:03:05.705
audience.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.108
I'm going to stop
displaying the merchandise.

00:03:15.108 --> 00:03:17.020
But thank you for the thought.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.360
May I begin by
inviting you to imagine

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.910
that we are removed in time
to the late 17th century.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.680
And it's about 1685.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.290
And you are in a
London coffee house.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.610
And you see two of
your acquaintances.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.610
One is Sir Isaac Newton.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.460
And the other is
Sir William Petty.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.890
No Petty will turn out
to be one of the founders

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:48.745
of modern economics.

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:50.950
And of course,
Newton's reputation

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.380
preceded him even then.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.630
Smart cookies, both of them.

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.850
Each, as you knew, intuited,
was on the verge of something

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.425
wonderful in his
respected discipline.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.930
Imagine now that you, a
citizen of the 17th century,

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.290
are transported in time and
in life to the present day.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.928
And you are informed the
physicists have recently

00:04:16.928 --> 00:04:18.094
discovered the God particle.

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.190
Whereas the economists,
who in 2008 failed

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.180
to predict the
biggest cyclical event

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.800
of their professional lives,
are debating the efficacy of 0%

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.300
rates.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.150
Or is it negative percent rates?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.100
Or is it something else?

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.420
Plainly, physics has made a
different kind of contribution

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.910
to human society
than economics has.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.130
So I stand before you in
a most unlikely setting

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.480
in which to propose the
thesis that in matters

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.360
of money and credit, the world
has gone not ahead, but rather

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.160
behind.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.060
If there's any audience
institution that

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.320
ought to be skeptical of a
claim that progress is not

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.530
inevitable and wondrous
and irrepressible,

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:15.510
it surely must this
splendid company.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.240
But nonetheless,
that is my thesis.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.140
I submit to you the progress, at
least in the physical sciences,

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.930
is cumulative.

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.100
We stand on the
shoulders of giants

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.260
in economics and finance.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.590
Progress is rather cyclical.

00:05:29.477 --> 00:05:30.060
We go forward.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.670
We go back.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.690
But we keep stepping
on the same rake.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.185
And in the four hours given
to you today so generously

00:05:38.185 --> 00:05:42.115
by the company, I'm going
to try to persuade you

00:05:42.115 --> 00:05:45.210
that we are, in fact,
stepping on the rake of money.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.230
Now the curious
thing about money,

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:50.540
we spend a-- now
as you can tell,

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.360
I'm not an employee of Google.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.800
You might infer by the fact
I did not get the memorandum

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.270
about dress today.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:59.754
On Wall Street.

00:05:59.754 --> 00:06:01.170
And people in my
neck of the woods

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:06.130
spend their entire lives trying
to accumulate dollar bills.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.840
But I warrant to you
that not a single one

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.970
of my dollar-- I was
going to say grubbing--

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.870
my dollar-accumulating
Wall Street friends

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.310
has devoted more than a
few minutes in the course

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:21.460
of his or her career to thinking
about the nature of that piece

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.354
of paper that he or she has
invested so many heartbeats

00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:30.693
in accumulating.

00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:33.920
You know, a bond is a
promise to pay money.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.420
You've heard about
bonds, of course.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.128
Debt instruments.

00:06:36.128 --> 00:06:38.290
But what is money?

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:51.410
So Chicago Cubs fans-- and now
the world is full of them--

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.160
might be wondering
about life the last time

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.350
their team was this good.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.610
That was 1908.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.530
Famously, the Cubs have been
unsuccessful since that time.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:04.690
They won the World
Series in 1908.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.670
And to send out
a marker in time,

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.800
I'm going to describe
the financial and credit

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.380
arrangements prevailing the
last time the Cubs won the World

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.720
Series with the present
day, which is respectively

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.310
the next time the Cubs are going
to go someplace besides home

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.100
in October.

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.760
And the year is 1908.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.520
And here is the way the
world worked with respect

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.720
to money and credit.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.930
With regard to
money, the dollar was

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:36.380
defined as a weight
of something tangible.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.450
Gold, $20.67 got you an ounce.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.920
That was written into the law.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.450
The dollar was
convertible into gold

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.790
at the option of the holder
of the paper currency.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:56.030
Such seemed to be the logic of
the constitutional stipulations

00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.770
about money,
Article 1, Section 8

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:02.390
defined money-- talked
about coining it.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:05.610
And in that same
constitutional breath,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:08.250
Congress was given not only
that right, but also the duty

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:09.750
to set weights and measures.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:13.120
Money was a weight
and a measure.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:15.530
Money is today something
very different.

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:19.250
It has become an instrument
of national policy.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:27.090
As to credit in 1908, the
stockholders of a bank

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:30.260
were responsible for
its solvency, which

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.770
meant if an institution
became impaired or insolvent,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.330
the stockholders
got a capital call.

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:40.350
That is, the courts
ordered them to fork over

00:08:40.350 --> 00:08:44.220
the unpaid in portion of
the par value pro rata.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.110
So if you were a
bank stock investor,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.130
and your bank hit the
rocks, the sheriff

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:53.720
would come calling
if you didn't heed

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:57.265
the first call from the court.

00:08:57.265 --> 00:08:58.390
Which seemed to make sense.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:00.654
After all, you, the
stockholder, got the dividends

00:09:00.654 --> 00:09:01.820
when things were going well.

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.460
Why shouldn't you be responsible
for the debts of the firm

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.760
when things were not going well?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.110
That was then.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.360
Individual responsibility
and credit and money

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.930
defined as an objective weight
and an objective measure

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.280
in the law.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.660
So fast forward to today.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:25.540
With respect to banking,
despite or perhaps

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.090
indeed a little bit because
of the Dodd-Frank legislation,

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:32.630
even more are the biggest
banks in the country

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:35.195
the responsibilities
of the taxpayers.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:45.030
Risk to a great degree
has been socialized.

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.240
Removed from the province of
individual responsibility.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.880
As to money, what is it exactly?

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.950
Well it's not defined.

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.020
A dollar is what the mandarins
at the Federal Reserve,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.130
and with the market in
concert with the central banks

00:09:59.130 --> 00:10:00.100
choose to make it.

00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:07.130
Here is an
observation concerning

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:12.400
the nature of modern money,
central bank-issued money.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.620
So since our sorrows
of 2008, the world

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:23.980
central banks have issued in
the aggregate about $10 trillion

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:27.605
worth of something called money.

00:10:27.605 --> 00:10:30.387
I mean, even a gold
bug such as myself

00:10:30.387 --> 00:10:32.470
would not disdain to pick
up a hundred dollar bill

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.760
if he saw it lying
on the sidewalk.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:42.510
But note the effort required
to materialize $10 trillion

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.520
in purchasing power.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.720
The effort required
is no greater, no less

00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.645
than that required to tap
in anything on YouTube.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:57.520
The cost of production
of money is zero.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.690
In times past, the
cost was substantial.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:06.460
It required human labor
to mine gold and silver.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.370
So the cost of
production is negligible.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.910
The effort to recreate
these units of currency

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:18.150
is negligible.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:26.290
And we know, I mean,
we somehow know it even

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.570
if we don't actually know it.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:32.460
We're aware that the money
is increasingly pixels.

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:33.490
No weight.

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.980
No corporeal substance.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.800
It exists on the hard
drive or in the cloud.

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.480
We know that, accept it.

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:48.910
Here is a story about one of
the not insignificant holders

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:55.500
of American common equity,
including Alphabet and Apple

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:59.600
and Exxon Mobil and
Facebook and the like.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.810
The holder in question is
a Swiss National Bank--

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.180
the Central Bank of
Switzerland-- the gnome's

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.420
own Federal Reserve.

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:10.680
And the Swiss National
Bank, like some sort

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.220
of New York hedge fund, files
a 13F form every quarter.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:19.940
13F form with the SEC
enumerates the filers' holdings

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:22.640
of common stock, give
them some stock by stock.

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.830
And the Swiss National
Bank's filing is voluminous.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.690
And you look down, you see
all these individual names.

00:12:30.690 --> 00:12:33.110
Owns 100,000 shares
of this, 40,000 shares

00:12:33.110 --> 00:12:36.220
of that, a billion to--
where did the Swiss National

00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:38.380
Bank get the money to do this?

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.340
Why, it created it.

00:12:40.340 --> 00:12:42.000
It manufactured it.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.130
It materialized it.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:46.600
It conjured Swiss
francs with which

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.680
to suppress the unwanted
appreciation of the Swiss franc

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.620
against the euro.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.570
So it accumulates
euros with francs

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.930
that it invents for the purpose.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.620
And with those euros,
it buys dollars.

00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.060
And with those dollars,
why, it buys your company.

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.800
Buy shares in some great
tech companies, not

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.400
so great industrial companies.

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.960
All manner of companies.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:12.340
2,600 different names
in the 13F filing.

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.750
Now there's nothing
really different.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:18.330
Common stocks versus bonds.

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.060
The World Central Bank have
bought like $10 trillion

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.670
worth of bonds.

00:13:22.670 --> 00:13:27.940
But to me, the vivid
nature of present day money

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:32.826
conjuring, of materialization
of these units of digital scrip,

00:13:32.826 --> 00:13:35.270
these ever so much more
vivid when you think

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:37.200
about something for nothing.

00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.490
And ladies and
gentlemen, the purchase

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:44.255
of actual interest in
productive American enterprise

00:13:44.255 --> 00:13:46.670
is something.

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:50.210
And the currency with which
those shares are purchased

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:56.150
is, in some sense, nothing.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:14:01.720
So this talk, as
you can see, has

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:06.080
taken the form of a
lamentation rather than

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:11.130
a really helpful investment talk
with CUSIP numbers and ticker

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:14.370
symbols, and the like.

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:17.980
But I wanted to
emphasize-- I hope

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:23.040
not to the point of ennui--
but still to emphasize

00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.480
my basic thesis, which is
that we are to a great degree

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.210
the unthinking prisoners in
a kind of hall of mirrors.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.680
We are living in the world
of the central banks.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:40.330
And I only wish that more of
us would speak up and protest.

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:41.330
Like, where is the exit?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.975
How do we get out of here?

00:14:42.975 --> 00:14:46.880
What was the movie in
which the protagonist

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.930
lived in the world of a TV set?

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:50.930
AUDIENCE: "Truman Show."

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:51.804
JAMES GRANT: Ah, yes.

00:14:51.804 --> 00:14:52.510
Right.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.080
Well, that's our world in a way.

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.430
We live in a hall of mirrors.

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:57.630
And it's a very pleasurable
hall of mirrors insofar

00:14:57.630 --> 00:15:00.847
as asset prices keep
levitating, and the rich

00:15:00.847 --> 00:15:01.680
keep getting richer.

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.138
Nothing wrong with
that, I suppose,

00:15:03.138 --> 00:15:06.460
if one is a member
of that fraternity.

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:09.480
But it is a world of artifice.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:15.540
Now I claim to you
in the early going

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:18.660
that in this most improbable
setting of progress,

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.390
innovation, and to be
sure, of imagination,

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.940
that in the very important
realm of finance and credit,

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.230
we are not progressing,
but rather retrogressing?

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:31.206
How is such a thing possible?

00:15:31.206 --> 00:15:33.390
Well, I invite you
to just to join

00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:38.480
with me in a kind of
intellectual or historical

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.980
sidebar.

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.460
The year is now 2012.

00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.140
And as I recall, there was
another presidential election.

00:15:47.140 --> 00:15:50.800
I can't exactly recall the name
of the Republican candidate.

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:52.820
Something to do with
Romney, I think.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.480
Any case, not
entirely successful.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:00.490
Before his political failure
became common knowledge,

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:05.330
there was a great
commotion among Republicans

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:09.390
to task the imminent
Romney administration

00:16:09.390 --> 00:16:11.450
with the duty of
forming a commission

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.750
to study alternatives to present
day monetary arrangements.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.630
That is to say,
let's do something

00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:18.894
about the Federal Reserve.

00:16:18.894 --> 00:16:20.310
This was called a
Gold Commission.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.200
The idea was to pick out the
best aspects of monetary regime

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.380
of yesteryear, and
perhaps to find

00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.981
a way out of our
delightful-- that

00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:32.980
is for the asset portion
holding the community--

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:34.620
our delightful prison.

00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:36.440
Our money prison.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:40.090
And this little thought
bubble of a Gold Commission

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.130
was met with polite
smiles and in some cases,

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.540
outright derision,
by the savants

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:50.557
of the economics profession,
especially the academic world.

00:16:50.557 --> 00:16:53.140
And one of them-- I believe it
might have been Larry Summers--

00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:55.420
as long as Republicans
were thinking about gold,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:57.460
they might as well
investigate the possibilities

00:16:57.460 --> 00:17:01.460
of the commission to
bring back witchcraft.

00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:07.720
Well, I thought that
was a little abroad.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.099
And it set me thinking
about an essay

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.410
by Hugh Trevor Roper
published some time ago.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.670
There's a delightful essay.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:18.589
I commend it to everyone who
was in the business of improving

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.839
the future and of seeing
progress in action.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:23.136
Namely, everyone in this room.

00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:24.950
And it's called
the "European Witch

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:29.650
Craze of the 16th
and 17th Centuries."

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:32.900
And in it, the
author, Trevor Roper,

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:35.487
sends up a warning signal
against the common presumption

00:17:35.487 --> 00:17:37.570
that the history of thought
traces a straight line

00:17:37.570 --> 00:17:40.280
from the darkness to the light.

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.200
Far from it, as he shows
by setting in evidence

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.620
the outbreak of quote--
"dark passions and infallible

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.270
credulities amidst the
flowering of the Renaissance."

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.130
"And the belief in
witches was not,"

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.540
Trevor Roper writes,
quote-- "as the prophets

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:57.350
of progress might
suppose, a lingering,

00:17:57.350 --> 00:18:00.240
ancient superstition,
only waiting to dissolve.

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.340
It was a new explosive
force, constantly

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:06.870
and fearfully expanding
with the passage of time.

00:18:06.870 --> 00:18:08.860
Credulity in high
places increased.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.820
Its engines of expression
were made more terrible,

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:13.610
more victims were
sacrificed to it.

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:16.260
The years 1550 to
1600 were worse

00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:18.270
than the years 1500 to 1550.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:23.090
And the years 1600 to
1650, more terrible still.

00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:24.860
Nor was the craze
entirely separable

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.850
from the intellectual and
spiritual life of those years.

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.830
It was forwarded by
the cultivated Pope's,

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.570
the Renaissance, by the
great Protestant reformers,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:34.480
by the saints of the
Counter Reformation,

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.320
by the scholars,
lawyers, and churchmen.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.210
If those two centuries
were an age of light,

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.930
we have to admit that,
in one respect, at least,

00:18:42.930 --> 00:18:46.670
the dark age was
more civilized."

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:49.040
So it is possible,
it is possible

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.800
for forward-thinking,
intelligent, and imaginative

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.260
people to be in the
thrall of something that's

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:56.470
palpably false.

00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:59.850
Could that something
today be the doctrines

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:03.190
of our doctors of economics?

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:04.580
I suggest to you that it is.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.120
I think two winters
ago, I live in New York.

00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:20.610
And on a Friday in January,
the National Weather Service

00:19:20.610 --> 00:19:22.747
issued a forecast
for a blizzard.

00:19:22.747 --> 00:19:23.830
And not just any blizzard.

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:26.890
This was to have
been the greatest

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.660
blizzard in the
history of New York

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.610
since the arrival of the Dutch.

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.290
It's OK by me.

00:19:32.290 --> 00:19:33.070
I love blizzards.

00:19:33.070 --> 00:19:34.850
And my wife and I
made preparations

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:36.580
for this onslaught.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:38.660
And we got ourselves
a reservation

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:41.160
at a local restaurant with
a great picture window.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.630
And we arrived Monday, the
day of the forecast, storm

00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:48.520
Monday night, to await this
fabulous meteorological light

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.040
show.

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:55.370
And as we sat down to dinner
and had a drink and [INAUDIBLE],

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.900
we couldn't help but notice
as the evening wore on,

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.310
that it wasn't snowing.

00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:07.590
And it's a lot to
ask of scientists--

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:10.770
they write all the time--
the storm did land but 50

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:12.203
miles to the East.

00:20:12.203 --> 00:20:15.000
But I got to thinking about
the nature of a snowflake,

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.280
as beautiful as it is, I guess
I was gonna say, as unique.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.010
It is unique.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.900
What snowflakes don't
do is watch CNBC,

00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:31.900
and having imbibed the
forecast, do their best

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.340
to confound it through
contrary bloody-minded action.

00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:38.110
That's what snowflakes don't do.

00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:40.782
But we humans are
exactly in that business.

00:20:40.782 --> 00:20:42.490
Sell us something
that's going to happen,

00:20:42.490 --> 00:20:44.900
well, we make preparations.

00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:52.439
And in the preparation,
we destroy the forecast.

00:20:52.439 --> 00:20:54.480
It's not going to happen,
because we have already

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.500
taken the action
that was predicted,

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.380
and maybe some other
action, besides.

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.180
Now this speaks-- the
nature of humanity

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:05.154
and the nature of
prophecy-- speaks directly

00:21:05.154 --> 00:21:06.070
to the business model.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.180
The people who make
these trillion dollars

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:11.010
of weightless,
non-corporeal money.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:20.400
I'm going to a favor
you with a-- the

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.280
Federal Reserve has on its
payroll 700 Ph.D. economists.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.510
700.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:32.380
I'm gonna say that
you need 701 or none.

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:34.740
It's not working.

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.190
And to get a taste
of the formative

00:21:37.190 --> 00:21:39.470
intellects at the
Federal Reserve,

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:41.710
I invite you to visit
any website that

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.790
lists the scholarly
productions of the employees.

00:21:45.790 --> 00:21:47.920
Here's one.

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.100
Computing dynamic stochastic
general equilibrium bottles

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.460
with recursive preferences
and stochastic volatility.

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.740
Now if you say those
words separately and read

00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:05.420
them backwards, well, the
general dynamic stochastic

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:11.120
equilibria model was the model
in place in 2006 and 2007,

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.900
and indeed, in 2003, 4, and 5.

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:20.170
And notice that it did
not set up any knowledge

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:23.971
within the Central Bank of
the oncoming events of 2008.

00:22:23.971 --> 00:22:24.470
None.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:33.070
Now this is relevant,
because the people in charge

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:34.790
are indeed in charge.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:37.930
They have power.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:40.310
In particular, they have a
power over this seemingly most

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:43.990
pedestrian thing called
the rate of interest.

00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:46.160
I speak perhaps with a
little bit of edge on this.

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.330
My publication is called
"Grant's Interest Rate

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.129
Observer."

00:22:49.129 --> 00:22:50.170
What are we going to see?

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.930
There's no more interest rates.

00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:53.280
God, interest rates were great.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.470
I remember we had them in 1984.

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:00.180
But we don't have
them much anymore.

00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:04.740
They are so small, one
can barely see them.

00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:08.900
And in that fact
lies a great deal

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:12.590
of what-- lies much
of what can explain

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:14.370
present-day financial affairs.

00:23:17.422 --> 00:23:22.120
You know, interest rates
are prices, critical prices.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.150
We use them to set
investment hurdle rates

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:33.780
and to calibrate risk, and to
discount projected future cash

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.280
flows.

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.529
They are probably the most
critical prices in finance.

00:23:36.529 --> 00:23:41.020
Yet they are under the thumb of
the central banks of the world.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.880
Self-awareness is not
the strongest suit

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:48.280
of our monetary mandarins.

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.952
Ben Bernanke-- who now
is working for PIMCO,

00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:54.910
is kind of a capital
introduction professional,

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.119
he helps people invest in
bonds-- was, as you know,

00:23:59.119 --> 00:24:01.160
the Federal Reserve Chairman
before Janet Yellen.

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:03.790
And in the day when
he was in office,

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:08.010
he gave a series of talks
in the public interest at I

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.180
think George
Washington University

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.580
in the District of Columbia.

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:16.030
And in one of these potted
talks about the modern history

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:20.702
of American economics,
he said, 1971,

00:24:20.702 --> 00:24:22.760
that was the year in
which for the first time

00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:25.387
in a non-wartime setting,
the federal government

00:24:25.387 --> 00:24:26.345
imposed price controls.

00:24:26.345 --> 00:24:27.685
A very bad thing.

00:24:27.685 --> 00:24:28.310
Terrible thing.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:31.950
Because after all, he
said in so many words,

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.910
prices are the signals, the kind
of traffic signals of a market

00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:35.410
economy.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.570
If you make them all red or
all green through federal fiat,

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:41.590
why, the traffic piles
up the intersections.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.580
And that's dangerous
and inefficient.

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.060
Prices, he said
in so many words,

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.170
must be discovered,
not administered.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.680
This was the man who
went on to execute

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:56.162
quantitative easing and 0%
rates and negative-- well,

00:24:56.162 --> 00:24:57.870
now they're talking
about negative rates.

00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:08.390
So I think that the critical
failure of the present regime

00:25:08.390 --> 00:25:15.230
in money is the conceit
that it is better for us

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.460
that prices-- these
critical prices--

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.410
be administrative,
rather than discovered.

00:25:24.950 --> 00:25:28.790
A long time ago in the annals of
this-- since I started talking.

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:31.800
It seems like a long time.

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:35.520
To me, if not to you.

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.530
My host made kind
reference to this product.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:43.990
And this book is a
history of the Depression

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:46.120
that people generally
don't talk about.

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.110
It was the one that
seemingly, as the title

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.120
says, with some journalistic
license, healed itself.

00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:54.790
The depression healed itself.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.975
The outlines of the
troubles took this format

00:26:01.975 --> 00:26:06.360
in industrial production down
about 30% between 1920 and '21.

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:07.897
From peak to trough.

00:26:07.897 --> 00:26:09.730
Unemployment certainly
in the double digits.

00:26:09.730 --> 00:26:13.880
It was not registered,
but was certainly severe.

00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:15.880
Stock market almost
down by half commodity.

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.530
Prices down by 40 odd percent.

00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.160
Corporate profits down 90%.

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.370
It was something.

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:26.440
And the government met this
with a balanced budget,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.250
and as you have heard, with
higher, not lower interest

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:31.750
rates.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:32.940
Which was perhaps a mistake.

00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:35.580
But still what
proceeded to happen

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:36.860
was that markets adjusted.

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.040
And prices fell.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.220
Wages fell.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.780
And because wages could
fall, profit margins

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:52.200
were restored at lower
levels of selling prices.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.340
So prices came down.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.800
Wages came down too.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.800
Equilibrium was restored at
lower levels of activity.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.866
And because things were cheap,
profit-seeking individuals

00:27:01.866 --> 00:27:02.740
sought opportunities.

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.925
The sent money here
for that very purpose.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.720
The gold price was fixed.

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.360
But the cost of mining it fell.

00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:14.500
And because the cost
of mining it fell,

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.920
profit margins for
the miners increased.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.260
And they proceeded to produce
more of what in a depression

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:23.000
the world needs more
of, which is money.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.150
So automatic forces, or
quasi-automatic forces

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.630
in the marketplace
proceeded to do

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:32.830
what government action in this
particular long-running cycle--

00:27:32.830 --> 00:27:36.730
it has been long-running, has it
not-- have so far singly failed

00:27:36.730 --> 00:27:39.300
to do.

00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:47.110
So in summary, my
lamentation is not

00:27:47.110 --> 00:27:51.430
about investing, which I
think is a great calling.

00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:53.490
Nor is it about the
United States of America,

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:57.320
which is a pretty
good place to live.

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:05.480
But rather it is the persistent
and-- after the passage

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.420
of so much time--
almost unnoticed

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.390
substitution of the visible
hand for the much more

00:28:11.390 --> 00:28:13.940
effective invisible one that
Adam Smith talked about.

00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:23.770
I hope I have not held out
the notion of a free market,

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:27.910
and of a price discovery as
a new kind of garden of Eden.

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:33.710
For it was certainly not in
the '20s, about which I wrote.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.840
This is, after all, humanity
we're talking about.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.890
If things were so easy,
we'd be a great deal richer.

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:43.620
I hope, say in conclusion now.

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.470
You look around this
wonderful campus.

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.060
You see the fantastic
things that you all

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:54.505
have given to the world.

00:28:54.505 --> 00:28:56.420
The world has purchased,
quite properly.

00:28:59.070 --> 00:29:04.790
But you wonder where were
our forebears all this time?

00:29:04.790 --> 00:29:09.510
Let us imagine that
the year is 45 BC,

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:13.060
or wherever the year
was that Cleopatra died.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:20.010
And one of her public-spirited,
altruistic handmaidens

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:23.580
made a deposit of the
equivalent of $100

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:26.610
in the Bank of Perpetuity,
buying an eternal CD

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:29.940
to compound a 2% per annum.

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:32.290
And that sum of money, let
us continue to imagine,

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:35.281
were left undisturbed
to present day.

00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:37.500
Now that would be something.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.210
Let's see.

00:29:38.210 --> 00:29:38.880
This is Google.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.790
We can calculate
this [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:39.790 --> 00:29:40.600
I'll do it for you.

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:43.170
And you can join me,
we'll just compare notes

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:48.930
and see what we want to do is
2% compounded annually of 2045.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:49.870
Let's see.

00:29:49.870 --> 00:29:51.390
I'll do it per capita.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.730
7.6 billion people on
the face of the Earth.

00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:54.530
Carry the 3.

00:29:54.530 --> 00:29:55.030
Yes.

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:01.720
$5.3 billion dollars
per Earthling

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.450
if, if, that sum of
money had been left

00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.240
undisturbed, unlikely probably
during the Black Death.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.860
Somebody might have
made a withdrawal.

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.200
And if the Bank of
Perpetuity had in fact

00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.497
been perpetual, unlikely,
given the nature of leveraged

00:30:18.497 --> 00:30:19.455
financial institutions.

00:30:19.455 --> 00:30:22.750
They're always toppling
over, aren't they?

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:28.430
And unlikely, given
the very human animal

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.910
himself or herself, [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:30.910 --> 00:30:33.540
In fact, we're not
that good with money.

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.150
But we can be better.

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.375
And it seems to
me the way forward

00:30:37.375 --> 00:30:40.430
is that a a paradoxical
means of stepping

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.440
backward and reclaiming
the institutions that

00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:47.040
worked so well the last time
the Cubs won the World Series.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.824
So, that's my speech.

00:30:49.824 --> 00:30:51.240
SAURABH MADAAN:
Thank you so much.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:55.048
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.840
We were having a
brief conversation

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:00.590
before the talk began.

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:04.110
And you shared a couple
anecdotes, which I thought

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.630
would be very interesting
for this audience.

00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:11.660
So let me start
with one, if I may.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:15.160
You guys got a shout out in
the movie, "The Big Short."

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:20.290
And you were mentioning to
me that during those days,

00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.000
you got a big pile of
documents in the mail.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.710
And you had a chemical
engineer working with you.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:33.360
And you asked him, what did
you make out of this material?

00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.520
And they said, I
didn't understand it.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:38.690
And your reaction was--

00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:39.790
JAMES GRANT: Yeah.

00:31:39.790 --> 00:31:41.671
We got a story.

00:31:41.671 --> 00:31:42.170
No.

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:43.880
It didn't make any sense to us.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.320
His name is Dan Gertner.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.570
And a very smart guy.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:55.280
And as you said, a chemical
engineer from his earlier life.

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:00.070
And by no means
intimidated by complexity.

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:02.860
And these documents
run thousands of pages.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.410
Very complex.

00:32:05.410 --> 00:32:08.100
But knowing that we didn't know,
knowing there was something

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.340
wrong, set us on the road to
persistence, which is always

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.600
a good road to be on, unless it
winds up at a dead end, which

00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:17.620
sometimes happens too.

00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.490
But we persisted and looked
at more of these things.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:25.310
And came to see that there
was actually no there there.

00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:27.809
And one of the ways
in which we came

00:32:27.809 --> 00:32:29.600
to understand that
we're on the right track

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:32.900
is the pushback and
the friction that we

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.832
encountered on Wall Street
from the stories we wrote.

00:32:35.832 --> 00:32:37.540
SAURABH MADAAN: They
were hostile to you?

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.145
JAMES GRANT: Well, they
were-- well, hostile-- yeah.

00:32:41.145 --> 00:32:41.780
They were.

00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.695
Well, if we had
been wrong, it would

00:32:46.695 --> 00:32:49.070
have been Gertner's fault.
But as it were, we were right.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.742
So.

00:32:50.742 --> 00:32:54.320
But once we were summoned
over to a friendly talking

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.370
to at Standard &amp; Poor's-- the
rating agency who wanted us

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:01.520
to understand as to
how very wrong we were,

00:33:01.520 --> 00:33:05.537
and how unhelpful we were
being to the situation.

00:33:05.537 --> 00:33:07.120
And then we really
knew we were right.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:17.360
SAURABH MADAAN: So did
additional evidence come in

00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:20.090
and help you refine the theory?

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.450
Like, what are some signals?

00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:27.500
And the reason I'm asking is, in
terms of a lot of your audience

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:30.450
here and on the
video on YouTube is

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:34.820
going to be people who are
engaged in investing, possibly.

00:33:34.820 --> 00:33:36.390
Like, is there some
sort of pattern

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:42.540
recognition that one can
employ to be cautious?

00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:45.400
JAMES GRANT: Well, it's a
wonderful question to which

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.060
there really is no answer.

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.190
One sees recurring
patterns in finance.

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:01.710
I think with respect
to the Federal Reserve,

00:34:01.710 --> 00:34:04.270
to the central banks,
to the nature of money,

00:34:04.270 --> 00:34:07.100
to interest rates, I
think there is setting up

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:13.489
one of the great dramatic
moments in finance.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:18.530
There are upwards of $9
trillion worth of securities

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.630
in the world that yield
less than nothing.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.400
These are debt
instruments, promises

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:26.510
to pay money undefined.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:32.050
And you, the investor,
pay the issuer

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:35.340
for the privilege of-- you
could say this as many times

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:35.840
as you want.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.360
It still won't make any sense.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:44.174
And I think I have in my
very hand, I have-- yes I do.

00:34:44.174 --> 00:34:46.090
I have a quotation from
"The Financial Times,"

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:48.780
a very distinguished
London newspaper, that

00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.840
distills the mindset
of the market

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:55.900
today with respect to
investing in fixed income.

00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:59.610
Quote-- this is from
April 15 edition.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.810
Quote-- "Some banks,
pension funds, and insurers

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.570
must buy safe government debt
irrespective of the price."

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:07.290
Close quote.

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:12.800
Now is any investment
asset intrinsically safe?

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.320
Is it intrinsically anything?

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:21.875
I mean, let me invite you
to go back in time, 1984.

00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:22.880
1984.

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:29.000
So interest rates spent the
years 1946 to 1981 going up.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.450
It went from 2 and 1/2% at
the low in the spring of 1946,

00:35:33.450 --> 00:35:38.150
to 15% in the fall of 1981.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.850
15%.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:43.960
You could have invested in 15%
30-year US Treasury securities

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:46.180
non call for 25 years.

00:35:46.180 --> 00:35:48.390
Equity returns with
no equity risk.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:49.810
You know who wanted that?

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:50.470
About nobody.

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.490
Because they had had
35 years of experience

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:56.040
with falling bond prices
and rising interest rates,

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.370
meaning losses.

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:04.919
So interest rates
began to come down.

00:36:04.919 --> 00:36:07.210
Paul Volcker was in at the
head of the Federal Reserve.

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.360
And it seems as if
he were making good

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.950
on his vow to kill
inflation dead

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:18.034
through the mighty, blunt-edged
instrument of tight money.

00:36:18.034 --> 00:36:20.200
It seems as if he were on
his way to achieving this.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.820
And then comes the
spring of 1984.

00:36:22.820 --> 00:36:24.225
And for whatever
set of reasons--

00:36:24.225 --> 00:36:26.100
and there are always
pretexts on Wall Street.

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:28.680
You can always make a story
about why something happened.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.460
But what did happen
is that interest rates

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.150
went back up again.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.285
And for just a moment
in the spring of 1984,

00:36:34.285 --> 00:36:36.520
not so many years
ago, you could have

00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:45.250
invested at 14% for 25 years
in US Treasury securities.

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:48.250
That was what Wall Street
calls the Retest of the Lows.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.120
A return to the low F
price, the high F yield.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.755
That was on offer
in the spring '94.

00:36:52.755 --> 00:36:54.470
And again, very few takers.

00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:55.250
I was there.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.325
And we chronicled this.

00:36:57.325 --> 00:36:58.200
You couldn't be sure.

00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:02.950
You thought-- nobody knew that
a new cycle in interest rates

00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.580
would last more than 30
years, which this one has.

00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:09.740
1981 to date of very low rates.

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:12.640
And now people can't
get enough of securities

00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.400
in which you pay them.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:16.900
So yes.

00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.150
We've got pattern recognition.

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:18.760
Yeah.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:24.650
And one of the patterns that
recurs is extremes of behavior

00:37:24.650 --> 00:37:26.900
and perception that
you feel are almost

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:29.450
supernatural in their error.

00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.300
You can't believe.

00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:37.720
People in 1979, '80,
'81, were watching

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:40.720
bond yields go up from 9%, 10%.

00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:43.700
When Volcker came
in, October 6, 1979,

00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:45.660
he gives a talk, a
press conference.

00:37:45.660 --> 00:37:47.000
It's a Saturday.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.750
Emergency meeting on Saturday.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.980
And he announces that owing
to the crisis of inflation

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.090
and of the dollar, that
he, Volcker, personally

00:37:55.090 --> 00:37:58.340
is going to oversee
the tightening of money

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:03.830
such that he is going to
ring inflation by its neck.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:06.960
Or words to that effect.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:10.760
So that was the
announcement of intent.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:16.080
At that moment, long-dated
treasuries were yielding 9%.

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:18.422
As I say, by the
time he demonstrated

00:38:18.422 --> 00:38:20.380
to the satisfaction of
the investment community

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:25.060
that he was serious,
they went to 15%.

00:38:25.060 --> 00:38:29.850
That was the degree of
mistrust of the institution

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.190
of central banking
in the early 1980s.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:36.420
Compare and contrast
the present day.

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.600
The economists at the Fed,
to a man and to a woman,

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.600
virtually, missed, as I
say, the biggest event

00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:44.819
of their professional lives.

00:38:44.819 --> 00:38:46.360
Yet they have come
out of this crisis

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:51.060
with greater power, greater
regulatory power, greater power

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.100
over interest rates.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.675
They have been the
instruments of the levitation

00:38:56.675 --> 00:38:58.477
of financial assets
through their talk

00:38:58.477 --> 00:38:59.560
and through their actions.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:01.990
Stock prices have
gone up and up.

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.040
Cap rates on real estate
come down and down.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:06.460
Interest rates down and down.

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:09.610
The world of assets
thanks them profusely.

00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:18.580
But it's a truism that the
future promises lower returns

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.200
the higher the price
in the present.

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:26.580
It's a truism that is hard to
act upon if you're an investor.

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:28.861
God, it feels good
when it's going up.

00:39:28.861 --> 00:39:31.360
SAURABH MADAAN: Charlie Munger
says something that cannot go

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.130
on forever has to
come to an end.

00:39:33.130 --> 00:39:34.790
JAMES GRANT: What does he mean?

00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:36.350
Well, that is entirely true.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.080
But I'm here to tell you--
I think Charlie's got

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:39.910
a few years on me.

00:39:39.910 --> 00:39:46.220
But I've been in situations,
and have been wrong enough

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.580
on some things that it seems
if things can't go on forever,

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:50.485
can and do.

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.500
SAURABH MADAAN: So
you've powerfully

00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:00.180
made the point of the so-called
invisible hand becoming

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.050
very visible.

00:40:01.050 --> 00:40:04.300
And you also refer to one
of the previous presidential

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:07.020
campaigns.

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.630
What's the solution?

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.500
Some say break up the big banks.

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.090
Others have other
solutions proposed.

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:17.760
What do you think
is the way out?

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.750
JAMES GRANT: I think
constructive retrogression

00:40:19.750 --> 00:40:21.110
in our institutions.

00:40:21.110 --> 00:40:23.370
What I would like to see
is, first and foremost,

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:28.210
individual responsibility
being restored to Wall Street.

00:40:28.210 --> 00:40:30.750
There's one
financial institution

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.370
in New York City that did not
take money from the Treasury,

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:36.750
took no TARP money, took
no bailout of any kind,

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.370
and was virtually
invisible in 2008.

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.300
That was Brown
Brothers Harriman,

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:44.812
which was founded about
the time that Citibank was.

00:40:44.812 --> 00:40:46.505
My brother has a
general partnership

00:40:46.505 --> 00:40:49.020
in the organization, meaning
that the general partners are

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:51.676
themselves personally
responsible

00:40:51.676 --> 00:40:54.870
in a pro rata fashion for
the debts of the firm.

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:57.680
Means not just that
their stock goes to zero,

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:00.930
but they lose their Matisse,
their golden retriever,

00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:01.930
their house, everything.

00:41:01.930 --> 00:41:03.721
SAURABH MADAAN: They
have skin in the game.

00:41:03.721 --> 00:41:04.435
More than that.

00:41:04.435 --> 00:41:05.185
JAMES GRANT: Yeah.

00:41:05.185 --> 00:41:08.320
So it would be nice,
to my mind, to go back

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.800
to stockholders' liability.

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.830
But without being
punitive, one should

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.640
insist the people who
enjoy the upside ought

00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.972
to be personally responsible, in
a leveraged financial setting,

00:41:18.972 --> 00:41:19.680
for the downside.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:23.170
The downside not just affects
them, but affects all of us.

00:41:23.170 --> 00:41:25.050
So number one I
think, is to get away

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:28.370
from socialized risk,
which I think is

00:41:28.370 --> 00:41:29.700
corrupting to the Republicans.

00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.950
I mean, it's
corrupting to finance.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:35.075
And then I think we have to get
away from the Ph.D. standard

00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:41.450
of monetary management, the
discretionary rule by people,

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:47.056
who as well-intended and as
well-credentialed as they are,

00:41:47.056 --> 00:41:49.582
are the practitioners
of a pseudo science.

00:41:49.582 --> 00:41:51.790
I mean, they say for instance,
they say for instance,

00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:53.750
the prices must go up 2% a year.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:56.860
That's the verdict of the
people who run monetary?

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.546
Why?

00:41:57.546 --> 00:41:58.045
Why?

00:42:00.555 --> 00:42:01.130
Who says?

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.480
Oh, they say.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.030
But they don't explain.

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:07.990
Is it just not possible that
by creating the extra credit

00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:11.560
with which to try to force
prices in general higher,

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.500
they create an
increment of credit

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:18.810
that does great damage to the
structure of things in finance

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:19.730
and in the real world.

00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:21.480
I mean, is it possible
that by doing this,

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:23.210
they create bubbles
in real estate?

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:25.760
In San Francisco
and in New York,

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:30.090
real estate values are back
to levels from which they

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:33.800
plummeted in 2006 and '07.

00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:38.280
So is this really
the way forward?

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.980
This command and control regime.

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:45.141
You know, people tax the
proponents of new gold

00:42:45.141 --> 00:42:45.640
standard.

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.050
They tax them with,
it is an anachronism.

00:42:49.050 --> 00:42:52.110
Well, it does sound
as if it were.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:54.800
Why not bring back the
cutthroat rays of the sexton?

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.870
Except there is a rather
subtle distinction

00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:07.200
between things and methods,
as in methods and money.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.970
the gold standard is about
a defined monetary unit

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.500
that is a weight and a measure.

00:43:17.050 --> 00:43:20.960
And around that defined
weight and a measure,

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:25.800
people, through collaborative
means and markets,

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.460
through the social
media of markets,

00:43:28.460 --> 00:43:29.990
work out their own salvation.

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:32.710
Now that sounds kind
of contemporary, right?

00:43:32.710 --> 00:43:35.380
And if you casted the
present-day arrangements

00:43:35.380 --> 00:43:38.320
as command and
control, one thinks

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:41.000
not of the enlightened
21st century,

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.550
but rather of say, Poland
in 1957, or something.

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:44.050
Right?

00:43:44.050 --> 00:43:46.180
That's command and control.

00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:47.970
So I would say the
anachronism is really

00:43:47.970 --> 00:43:51.030
on the part of those
who would defend rule

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:56.075
by these-- I think they are
intellectual pretenders.

00:43:56.075 --> 00:43:59.000
And I think it's high time
that smart people began

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.100
to look into the science of
economics and say, or what?

00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:07.560
What are we talking about?

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:15.500
If the rigor of science have to
do with its predictive value,

00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.770
and if you missed the biggest
snowstorm not by 50 miles,

00:44:19.770 --> 00:44:23.165
but by 5,000 miles,
shouldn't we at least

00:44:23.165 --> 00:44:24.290
have congressional hearing?

00:44:26.184 --> 00:44:28.475
SAURABH MADAAN: I mean, I'm
going to try and lighten up

00:44:28.475 --> 00:44:29.770
the mood here a little bit.

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:30.436
JAMES GRANT: No.

00:44:30.436 --> 00:44:31.930
This is good.

00:44:31.930 --> 00:44:35.350
SAURABH MADAAN: I know
you're all fired up.

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:38.760
So I was asking you
about your-- you

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.429
had a degree in
international affairs.

00:44:40.429 --> 00:44:41.220
JAMES GRANT: I did.

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.270
Talk about pretense.

00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:47.780
SAURABH MADAAN: No MBA, right?

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:48.160
JAMES GRANT: No.

00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.118
SAURABH MADAAN: No MBA.

00:44:49.118 --> 00:44:52.840
JAMES GRANT: I'm like the
guy in Nashville who says,

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:53.760
can you read music?

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.350
No.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:58.010
That doesn't hold me back.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:00.370
SAURABH MADAAN:
So when I ask you,

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:02.300
how did one thing
lead to another?

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.110
And where you are?

00:45:03.110 --> 00:45:06.240
And you asked me-- I
grew up in North India.

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.840
And he retorted.

00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:10.880
He said, what did you
think were the odds of you

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.870
working in a company in
Sunnyvale called Alphabet?

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:17.295
And so you were talking
about serendipity.

00:45:17.295 --> 00:45:19.000
Right?

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.820
And you also mentioned
to me that there's

00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.800
this huge obsession
about longevity

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.620
at the risk of quality
and happiness in life.

00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:29.610
What did you mean by that?

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:31.564
JAMES GRANT: Well, I'm
going to-- unless it's

00:45:31.564 --> 00:45:32.480
a breach of copyright.

00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.230
I'm very sensitive on
copyright, actually.

00:45:34.230 --> 00:45:36.490
But I will investigate
the copyright implications

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:38.784
of my promise to
forward you a piece that

00:45:38.784 --> 00:45:40.950
appeared in "The London
Spectator" a couple of weeks

00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:41.595
ago.

00:45:41.595 --> 00:45:42.740
It was a marvelous piece.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.890
It was written by an
octogenarian, I think,

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:49.090
who said that here he
is, having achieved

00:45:49.090 --> 00:45:51.570
the modern be all
and end all, which is

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:53.860
to have achieved a certain age.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.240
He has not died,
and is biblically

00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.140
allotted 3 score and 10.

00:45:59.140 --> 00:46:00.680
But he has lived beyond that.

00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:02.070
Maybe he might be 90.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:04.050
And he says, by the
way, it's not so hot.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:09.110
And he enumerates his
ailments and his infirmities

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:10.550
and his deficiencies.

00:46:10.550 --> 00:46:17.300
And he says, to
young people, no.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:20.090
Eat, drink, and be merry.

00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:23.260
Know that-- and he's not
talking about debauch.

00:46:23.260 --> 00:46:25.910
He's talking about
living in the moment

00:46:25.910 --> 00:46:32.360
without a contemporary
obsession with things

00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:36.345
that if you were unlucky, will
land you at the age of 97.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.577
In closing, he said a very,
very powerful line or two.

00:46:45.577 --> 00:46:47.660
Like he said, when I look
back at my life, he say,

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.910
the things that make me
smile, the things that gave me

00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:53.610
pleasure were when I drank
too much, and smoked too much,

00:46:53.610 --> 00:47:00.110
and climbed too high, and fell
too far, and tried too hard.

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:01.827
So go for it, Google.

00:47:01.827 --> 00:47:02.910
SAURABH MADAAN: Thank you.

00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:04.800
This is fantastic.

00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.780
So we're open for
questions, folks.

00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:08.862
JAMES GRANT: Yeah.

00:47:08.862 --> 00:47:10.570
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
Mr. Grant for coming

00:47:10.570 --> 00:47:12.320
to speak to us today.

00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:17.470
So a few days ago, maybe a
couple days ago, Donald Trump

00:47:17.470 --> 00:47:23.280
talked about essentially
defaulting on

00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:24.757
like US government debt.

00:47:24.757 --> 00:47:27.090
And I was kind of surprised
that the markets didn't seem

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:31.180
to react at all to that at all.

00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.470
Do you think that as we get
closer to a possible Trump

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:39.550
presidency, that this
might actually sort

00:47:39.550 --> 00:47:40.952
of slay one of the sacred cows?

00:47:40.952 --> 00:47:43.160
JAMES GRANT: Well, Donald
Trump speaks with authority

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.548
in the matter of default.

00:47:44.548 --> 00:47:47.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.645
Dozens of companies,
of course, hundreds

00:47:49.645 --> 00:47:53.470
have defaulted once
in modern times.

00:47:53.470 --> 00:47:55.990
Many fewer have defaulted twice.

00:47:55.990 --> 00:47:58.760
Many fewer still,
three and four times.

00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:01.700
Trump's Resort and
Casino in Atlantic City

00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.260
holds the indoor record for
having defaulted five times.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:08.890
So this man speaks with
authority on the matter.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.280
Now by way of
historical preface,

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.680
the United States has defaulted.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:18.470
We defaulted on promise
to pay our debts

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:21.070
in gold in 1933 and '34.

00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.840
That was known in the city of
London as the American Default.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.800
And again in 1971,
when Nixon said

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.880
that no more would be honor
promises to redeem dollars

00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.820
at $35 to the ounce of gold.

00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:35.340
So that was default number two.

00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:42.840
And there is a default built
into the monetary method

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.660
of trying to achieve
2% inflation per year

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.590
over the course
of a 30-year bond.

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:50.762
Of course, 2% loss of purchasing
power every year adds up.

00:48:50.762 --> 00:48:52.470
And you're not looking
at much in the way

00:48:52.470 --> 00:48:54.240
of return in purchasing power.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.200
So the default is
a defined term.

00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:00.410
Now, I think apropo of Donald
Trump's remarks on Monday, sir,

00:49:00.410 --> 00:49:01.470
you have to keep up.

00:49:01.470 --> 00:49:03.011
He recanted that on
Monday afternoon.

00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.240
Every day's a new adventure
in his policy making.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:12.390
But he's all about negotiating.

00:49:12.390 --> 00:49:13.410
So I don't know.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:20.760
I mean the way to think about
the American public debt,

00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:23.410
I suggest you visit the
Cato Institute website.

00:49:23.410 --> 00:49:27.340
There's a free analysis
available by a very good

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.930
thinker named Jeffrey Miron.

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:30.760
M-I-R-O-N.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.840
And in this analysis,
he says, let's

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.760
take the present value of
American government promises

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:41.120
to pay, that is, the
policies in place

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.800
now, especially medical
care, social security.

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:49.430
Let us assume those go forward
as now budgeted for 75 years.

00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:52.840
And let us compare the
present value of expected tax

00:49:52.840 --> 00:49:54.820
revenues using
assumptions, which

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:57.590
of course, might be errant.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:00.950
And compare those to the present
value of expected outlays

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:03.035
and the present value
of expected income

00:50:03.035 --> 00:50:04.410
for the government.

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:10.410
And the difference in the
present value is $120 trillion.

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:12.491
That's the whole.

00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:13.740
So that's what they call them.

00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:17.050
The trade unsustainable,
unless something is done.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.610
Now Donald Trump wants
more medical care.

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:22.660
He wants-- to make America
great, you have to be healthy.

00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:24.410
So he wants more of this stuff.

00:50:24.410 --> 00:50:29.090
And I dare say that his likely
democratic sparring partner

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:30.360
is going to want more as well.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:33.620
So the question to
me about default

00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:38.700
is rather more nuanced than
the Trump Resort and Casino

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.590
simply not paying and
getting really clever lawyers

00:50:41.590 --> 00:50:43.990
to rewrite the covenants.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:47.412
But I think that some
adjustment in our debt burden

00:50:47.412 --> 00:50:48.120
is in our future.

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:51.760
Either through-- I don't
know-- through something.

00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.410
Perhaps through inflation, or
perhaps through negotiation.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:57.780
AUDIENCE: How do you feel
about an audit of the Fed?

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.180
And if that were to happen,
what are your hopes or fears

00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:03.970
about what might be discovered
and what action might

00:51:03.970 --> 00:51:06.430
be taken as a result of that?

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:13.570
JAMES GRANT: I think the audit
ought to look at not only

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.930
the balance sheet and the
finances, which I guess

00:51:15.930 --> 00:51:18.070
are kind of OK.

00:51:18.070 --> 00:51:20.160
Although awfully big.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:22.110
Trillions upon trillions.

00:51:22.110 --> 00:51:30.200
But I think an audit ought
to go into the assumptions

00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:34.344
and the analyses that
inform the Fed's actions.

00:51:34.344 --> 00:51:36.760
I think the more sunlight on
this institution, the better.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:42.610
I mean, the Fed ought to be
regarded as a vast government

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:44.570
monopoly.

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.200
And what every monopoly
needs is competition.

00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.200
So as much I'd like to
see an audit for the Fed,

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:55.360
I would also like to see a
simple change in the tax system

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.260
such that silver and gold would
not be taxed as a collectible,

00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.380
but rather we treat it as money
in the tax system, whereby

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:07.910
gold could compete in the open
market for monetary allegiance.

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:11.720
There's a company called
Gold Money, which is

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.990
kind of like a bitcoin thing.

00:52:13.990 --> 00:52:16.902
And it's a very small caliber
enterprise at the moment.

00:52:16.902 --> 00:52:18.110
But why not give it a chance?

00:52:18.110 --> 00:52:19.318
Let's see what people choose.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.550
So yes.

00:52:22.550 --> 00:52:27.195
The Fed, more sunlight the
better, and competition please.

00:52:27.195 --> 00:52:27.820
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:31.254
I know a lot of the
liberal intelligentsia,

00:52:31.254 --> 00:52:33.420
like Lawrence Summers, make
fun of the gold standard

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:35.820
and compare it to witchcraft.

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:42.160
And I'm curious how in practice
would you bring it back?

00:52:42.160 --> 00:52:44.260
What would be the
steps you would take?

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.966
What would be the
outcomes, et cetera?

00:52:46.966 --> 00:52:48.340
JAMES GRANT: It's
a big question.

00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:50.140
And I won't tax you
and the audience

00:52:50.140 --> 00:52:56.050
with details which
I'm not sure I can

00:52:56.050 --> 00:52:57.660
do a very good job explaining.

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:03.070
But I think the essence would
be to define money as a material

00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:07.280
object, as a weight
and a measure,

00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:11.490
and to fix currency
values internationally.

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.720
So you have to coordinate
among the leading countries

00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:17.910
and to restore fixed exchange
rates, which after all, were

00:53:17.910 --> 00:53:20.300
they regime in place
from the founding--

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.180
really in this country,
the founding to 1971.

00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:29.030
Our experience with
pure fiat currency

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:33.390
and with floating exchange
rates dates only really to 1971.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:36.960
So it's a very small experiment
in the long-running history

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:37.460
of money.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:42.700
I think a lot of
people are hung up

00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:46.549
on the evident anachronism
of people walking around

00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:48.090
with a bunch of gold
in their pocket.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.570
And they wouldn't.

00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:52.970
Even in the 19th
century, they didn't.

00:53:52.970 --> 00:53:56.010
Bank notes where
portable, light.

00:53:56.010 --> 00:54:01.010
There was a panic in the
city of London in 1825.

00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:08.950
And the authorities, to
intervene and to quell this,

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:10.590
gave the Bank of
England permission

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:12.070
to issue one pound notes.

00:54:12.070 --> 00:54:13.660
Previously they
could not do that.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:15.720
The only sovereign
gold coins, one pound,

00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:19.090
were each little tiny things.

00:54:19.090 --> 00:54:21.160
And people were glad for it.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:23.220
And they didn't
really-- what gold does

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:26.145
is to serve to anchor value.

00:54:26.145 --> 00:54:30.410
And in this day and
age, when your phone

00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:32.510
is your bank and your
brokerage account,

00:54:32.510 --> 00:54:39.880
and so many other things,
you could deal in gold

00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.800
electronically.

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:43.070
It's infinitely
divisible in weight.

00:54:43.070 --> 00:54:45.610
It's one of its many
monetary features.

00:54:45.610 --> 00:54:50.490
So I think what
gold would do would

00:54:50.490 --> 00:54:53.115
be-- what the effect
would be would

00:54:53.115 --> 00:54:59.030
be to create an objective value
around which prices would move,

00:54:59.030 --> 00:55:02.400
rather than now changing
the value of money

00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:05.570
so that prices and wages
don't have to move.

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:11.590
Now that would be a change that
the American people would have

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:13.320
to choose to accept or not.

00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:16.450
It's rather a big change.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:22.110
But we have borne seven or eight
years of this sleepwalking, 1

00:55:22.110 --> 00:55:23.280
and 1/2% growth.

00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:24.510
There's something wrong.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:27.070
And I think in the
course of auditing

00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.570
the Fed, let's audit
our intellects.

00:55:28.570 --> 00:55:31.300
Let us audit the ideas
by which we live,

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:32.640
and see if we can't do better.

00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.090
I think at least some
serious investigation

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:38.640
into the nature of money
and nature of credit

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.200
might help us improve our lots.

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:44.070
AUDIENCE: Do you think Ron
Paul has been suppressed

00:55:44.070 --> 00:55:44.990
by the powers that be?

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:48.869
Cause well, I mean, this is what
he speaks, as you well know.

00:55:48.869 --> 00:55:49.660
JAMES GRANT: Right.

00:55:49.660 --> 00:55:53.570
AUDIENCE: Because
he would want you

00:55:53.570 --> 00:55:55.490
to be in his administration.

00:55:55.490 --> 00:55:56.050
So.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:58.140
JAMES GRANT: We fell a
couple of electoral votes

00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.910
short on that one.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.966
AUDIENCE: I realize that.

00:56:00.966 --> 00:56:01.590
I realize that.

00:56:01.590 --> 00:56:03.300
But he was going
to have one, right?

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.510
So my question is,
I lived overseas

00:56:06.510 --> 00:56:07.590
in Europe for many years.

00:56:07.590 --> 00:56:12.160
You couldn't even get any
information on Ron Paul there.

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.990
I was an English teacher at
the time for bankers, actually.

00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:18.260
And they wanted
to know about him.

00:56:18.260 --> 00:56:21.300
But even here in
America, he gets

00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:23.910
a lot of people who
want following him.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:25.652
But the media squelches him.

00:56:25.652 --> 00:56:27.110
JAMES GRANT: Well,
I think Ron Paul

00:56:27.110 --> 00:56:30.700
is regarded in the
mainstream media as a crank.

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.760
That is a fact.

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:37.410
But one of the things that the
World Wide Web has opened up

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:42.930
is alternative methods of media,
of journalism, of information.

00:56:42.930 --> 00:56:45.340
And trying to suppress
something-- I mean,

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:49.220
I guess Facebook maybe is
trending the wrong things.

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:50.970
I read in the paper.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.070
But I think that is evidence.

00:56:53.070 --> 00:56:55.280
And I think the world finds out.

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:58.050
I think that people
know everything they

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:00.590
want to know about Ron Paul.

00:57:00.590 --> 00:57:03.930
I don't think it's a
conspiracy of silence.

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:09.266
I think there is a
blockheaded misperception

00:57:09.266 --> 00:57:13.220
of the way our financial
affairs are ordered,

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:15.840
and the ideas that inform them.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:21.360
And so how do you
deal with that?

00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.760
I think you get better ideas.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:27.820
You get up off your duff
and try to make things

00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:35.010
better, which doesn't sound very
imminently successful, does it?

00:57:35.010 --> 00:57:38.660
But in short, I
don't think there's

00:57:38.660 --> 00:57:40.910
a program against Ron Paul
I think Ron Paul personally

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:41.993
is actually irrepressible.

00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:46.800
SAURABH MADAAN: Jim, thank you
so much for being so candid

00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.510
and sharing your
thoughts with us.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:49.680
We appreciate it very much.

00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.638
JAMES GRANT: Thank you.

00:57:50.638 --> 00:57:53.930
[APPLAUSE]
