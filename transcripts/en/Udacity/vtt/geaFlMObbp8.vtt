00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.900
In fill scene, you need to delete the ambient light or at least comment it out.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.634
And then create a point light and add it to the scene. The position of this

00:00:06.634 --> 00:00:09.280
light initially doesn't matter, since it'll be moved to match the camera's

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.661
position. In the render method, you copy the camera's position to the

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:15.744
headlights. Now, when rendering takes place, you have a headlight giving a

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:18.986
varying shade to the visible areas. In practice, you may want to set the

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:22.249
headlight's intensity lower, since its effect is fairly obvious.
