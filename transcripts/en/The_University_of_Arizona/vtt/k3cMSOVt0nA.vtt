00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.180
Similar to Jeffrey, I
have my own challenges

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:05.590
with my disability.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.650
And I felt like there's
a need for more people

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.340
to be working on technologies
in rehabilitation engineering--

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.340
exoskeletons being one
of them, wheelchair

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.580
designs, and other kind
of adaptive equipment.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.170
So that's kind of how I
got into wanting to do

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.660
rehabilitative engineering.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.450
The whole story really
started 18 years ago

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.320
when Jeffrey got sick, and he's
worked every day for 18 years

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.600
to get better.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.350
As his caregiver,
and his mother,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.970
how could I do anything
but help him every day?

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.990
And so last summer we
were talking about it,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.660
and I had made a variety
of projects myself,

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.460
but this was going to
be a little bit more

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.380
than what I could do in the
garage between Ace Hardware,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:56.860
hire a welder.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.620
And I called the engineering
department and they said,

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.270
you know what, why
don't you see if you

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.100
can sign up to do a project.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.860
We put out a letter, email,
and stuff to friends,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.220
and they just all came together.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.330
The $10,000 was way
surpassed for the fee

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.810
to get into this program.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.330
This project has so much heart.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.160
And engineering, you
know, this is really

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.010
improving the life
of a human being.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.265
And that's, as a
biomedical engineer,

00:01:26.265 --> 00:01:27.640
that's kind of
our goal, too, you

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.100
know-- just using
engineering principles,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.320
mathematical principles,
science principles in order

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.640
to improve human health.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.770
And I really feel
like that's what

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.490
we're doing with this project.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.720
The ultimate goal is to
run with the exoskeleton

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.916
that the team has made.

00:01:52.916 --> 00:02:05.354
It's been a really long,
exciting, and beneficial

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:10.350
journey for everyone involved.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.950
You're OK.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.900
Here, now, if you grab
his foot there, Thomas--
