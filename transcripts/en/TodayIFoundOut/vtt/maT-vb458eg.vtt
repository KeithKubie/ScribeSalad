00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:15.890
With 
so many facets of modern life being automated,

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.699
signatures being easy to forge, and given
how difficult it is to prove based on signature

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.110
alone whether a given person actually signed
something, using a person’s exact signature

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.699
“design” for verification purposes after
the fact is rapidly going the way of the Dodo.

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.580
This leads us to the question of the day-
given all this, is there any rule about what

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.100
exactly your signature has to look like?

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.690
Can you, for example, just sign all your legal
documents with a big X like they do in cartoons?

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.360
As it turns out, just like it’s possible
to cash those big novelty checks because there’s

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.719
no rule about what a check has to look like
or be made of (just what information needs

00:00:52.719 --> 00:01:00.570
to be included), you can, in many regions
of the world, sign a document in any way you

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.570
wish.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.330
This is because a signature from a legal standpoint
is just proof that you considered and accepted

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.330
something.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.639
Or to quote the U.S.’ Uniform Commercial
Code §3-401(b):

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:15.469
A signature may be made (i) manually or by
means of a device or machine, and (ii) by

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:21.520
the use of any name, including a trade or
assumed name, or by a word, mark, or symbol

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.799
executed or adopted by a person with present
intention to authenticate a writing.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.149
In other words, even if you sign a document
in the U.S. and many other parts of the world

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.259
with an ultra-detailed drawing of an anatomically
correct phallus, you’re still legally bound

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:41.039
by the terms of that document because it’s
the act of signing a document that matters,

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:43.249
not the signature itself.

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.009
This is why it’s possible to sign documents
using a stamp, pencil, printed signature,

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.739
digitally online or even simply by typing
your name at the end of an email message in

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:55.819
which you discuss and state you agree to some
deal.

00:01:55.819 --> 00:02:00.049
In fact, there has been a long precedent of
such electronic remote agreements going all

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.700
the way back to the telegraph, such as an
1869 case Howley v. Whipple in which a U.S.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.760
court determined that agreeing to terms in
a telegram was indeed legally binding, with

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.430
the court stating in part:

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.680
When a contract is made by telegraph… if
the parties authorize their agents… to make

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.680
a proposition on one side, and the other party
accepts it through the telegraph, that constitutes

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.319
a contract in writing under the statue of
frauds… it makes no difference whether [the

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.810
telegraph] operator writes with a steel pen
an inch long attached to an ordinary penholder,

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.730
or whether his pen be a copper wire a thousand
miles long.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.239
Nor does it make any difference that in one
case common record ink is used, while in the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.180
other case a more subtle fluid, known as electricity,
performs the same office.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.440
Granted, exact rules vary a little from region
to region and some specific institutions might

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.470
have internal rules regarding what is an acceptable
signature and what implement must be used

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.459
(such as some perhaps requiring something
be signed in blue pen or the like).

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.810
But except in very specific cases, in many
regions of the world the law of the land does

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.670
not (usually) care in the slightest about
those types of internal rules.

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.129
From a legal standpoint, having your signature
be a stamp replica of your dog’s paw print

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.650
is a perfectly acceptable way to acknowledge
you agree to the terms of a contract.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.790
Again, the point is just to signify you agree
to the terms.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.379
That said, because of how lax the laws are
with respect to what a signature must look

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.299
like (and how difficult it is to determine
if something was signed fraudulently even

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:32.829
when a typical signature is used), certain
contract types require things like witnesses

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.959
or sometimes even a notary public to attest
that they observed you signing a document

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.109
in order for the statute to be considered
legally valid.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.139
For instance, this is generally the case with
wills or marriage contracts.

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:49.849
(It’s also noteworthy that usually the witnesses
observing the signing of a will also must

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:55.060
not be individuals who are to be bequeathed
something in the will.)

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.000
Coming back to the issue of signing something
just using the letter X, you may have deduced

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.529
by now that this is very much something you
can usually do outside of specific cases where

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:06.989
a given institution may not accept such.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.290
However, most will accept an X owing to the
fact that this has long been a common way

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.180
for illiterate individuals to sign a document.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.431
Other methods sometimes used by those who
can’t write and haven’t otherwise come

00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:23.139
up with a scribble signature also include
things like a simple drawing or in some countries

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.370
a thumbprint is common.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.900
On this latter thumbprint “signature”
style, while still not bulletproof, this certainly

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.760
beats name signatures for later verification
purposes, even for the literate.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.500
Now, with regards to individuals who are illiterate
or otherwise can’t read the language used

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.229
in a contract, you may be wondering if they
can really be legally bound by a document

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.310
that they can’t even read even if they do
sign it.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.770
It turns out, yes- from a legal standpoint
it is the duty of the signing party to discern

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.690
the terms of a contract before signing.

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:59.169
Ignorance about some stipulation in a contract
is not a legal way to get out of it, unless

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.080
it can be shown that the other party was deliberately
deceptive about the terms of the contract

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.130
or that the contract itself was fundamentally
different than what was expected.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.090
However, this latter point (known as non est
factum) is often an incredibly hard thing

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.620
to prove and, again, ignorance of the contents
of the text of a contract is not a valid way

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:22.670
to get the contract voided.

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:28.400
(As you might imagine, this area of contract
law is not without controversy given an illiterate

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:33.720
person may not wish to reveal this fact to
anyone for various reasons including embarrassment,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.039
fear of this fact being exploited, and in
some cases fear a deal will fall through if

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.350
their illiteracy was known.)

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:46.390
In any event, beyond the aforementioned misrepresentation
rules, other potential ways a signed contract

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.970
may be considered invalid in the eyes of the
law include things like if it was signed under

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:55.640
coercion, if it was voided before the end
of a grace period after signing (for certain

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.090
types of contracts), if a person is a minor,
or if the person is deemed mentally impaired

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.690
in some significant way.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.199
And, note, being intoxicated or under the
influence of some voluntarily taken substance

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.659
does not usually count for getting out of
a contract unless it’s provable that the

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:17.730
other party used said fact to intentionally
exploit the inebriated individual.

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.039
So if pretty much anyone can legally sign
a contract in most any way they please outside

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:27.449
of some specific exceptions, just how ridiculous
can your signature get before someone would

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:28.449
notice?

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:32.030
Well, luckily this question was partially
answered by comedian John Hargrave who enjoys

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.159
signing checks and receipts as everyone from
Zeus to Mariah Carey without having anyone

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:38.159
question it.

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:43.220
He even for a time attempted to look as shady
as possible in his purchases, including going

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.680
on a massive shopping spree, buying a quarter
ton of chemical fertilizer (the stuff you

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.870
can use to make a bomb), and signing his receipts
with the word “Stolen”.

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.389
In the end, neither his credit card company
nor the cashiers noticed.

00:06:56.389 --> 00:06:58.070
This is for somewhat good reason.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:01.860
For a variety of reasons we’ll get into
in another article later this week, a signature

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:07.790
is an extremely poor data point to use to
determine if a given purchase is fraudulent.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.790
So while credit card companies do record and
otherwise store these signatures electronically,

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:15.790
there’s generally little point in anyone
bothering to actually look at them.

00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:21.250
As Mastercard executive Carolyn Balfany notes,
“accessing them is not a regular occurrence”

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.000
unless the customer claims they didn’t sign
for or buy something.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.180
But even then, again, the signature is often
only a minor data point used to try to determine

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.490
if a given purchase was actually fraudulent.

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:36.560
This laissez-faire attitude these companies
take towards signatures today is a far cry

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.139
from several decades ago when they generally
hired huge teams of people to pore over the

00:07:42.139 --> 00:07:47.919
signatures, comparing them to the signed cards
on file to ensure something like a check wasn’t

00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:50.620
fraudulent before approving the ultimate transfer
of money.

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:55.440
But in modern times, this security measure
(and in a lot of respects a physical signature

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.330
alone, even when talking more broadly about
contracts in general) is simply completely

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:05.940
outdated in its effectiveness to achieve the
job it’s intended to do- offer proof you

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.940
agreed to something.

00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:11.690
In the case of credit cards, even if cashiers
bothered to check signatures at all, which

00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:16.240
most don’t, the signature does not provide
any real hurdle to credit card thieves.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.030
(Again, we’ll have more on this in an upcoming
article later this week on why credit card

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:23.660
companies still make you sign the back of
a credit card for said card to be considered

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:27.710
valid, despite this being nearly worthless
as a security measure.)

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:33.310
But to conclude, while certainly a given institution
may have internal requirements with regards

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:37.290
to your signature before they’ll accept
some bit of paperwork or the like as valid,

00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:40.760
if you’ve ever had the bright idea to sign
a different name or draw a smiling rocket

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.970
powered unicorn with machine guns for teeth
as your signature on a legally binding document

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.850
to try to get out of the thing later, don’t
expect this to help you in any legal way.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:55.440
At the end of the day, it’s the act of signing,
not the physical scribbles you make, that

00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:22.620
matters from a legal standpoint.
