00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.190
MALE SPEAKER: We've all heard
the stories about the poor

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.790
woman in the third world who
gets a loan for $50 and buys a

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.910
sewing machine and lifts her
family out of poverty.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.210
And who wouldn't love
that story?

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.120
We all love it.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.950
And so about 20 years ago, a lot
of money started flooding

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.890
into this sector.

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.600
And maybe you wonder
where it all goes.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.130
So Hugh Sinclair is here today
to tell us where it goes.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.810
Hugh's stayed in some of the
worst hotels on the planet,

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.650
eaten some of the worst food on
the planet, including the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.555
porcupine smoothie.

00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:36.180
Make sure and ask him
about that one.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.380
So he spent about 10 years in
places like Mozambique, and

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.470
Mexico, and Lagos, Nigeria,
right next to the building

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.570
where all those Nigerian princes
live, and gotten in

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.380
for a bit of trouble by telling
the truth about where

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.110
the money actually goes and
what happens to it.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.660
For instance, ask
him about Kiva.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.640
He has some good stories
about that.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.150
So without further ado--

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.750
I always love saying that--

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:02.700
please welcome Hugh Sinclair.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.160
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.890
HUGH SINCLAIR: Lovely.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.330
Thank you very much.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.590
Great honor to be in the
Google headquarters.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.530
Heard a lot about it.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.600
Lightning introduction.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.870
I mean, first of all, how
familiar are people with

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.440
microfinance?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.360
You all vaguely know
what it is.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.690
Has anyone done any investments
in microfinance,

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.560
in Kiva, those sorts
of things, funds?

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.570
Yeah, OK.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.380
So this is probably going
to be kind of sobering.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.190
I'm an economist originally, and
former investment banker.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.070
I have an MBA from IESE Business
School in Barcelona.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.750
And I was, I believe, the
last employee at Enron.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.890
I joined two weeks before
it collapsed.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.010
So it's either totally
my fault or

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.090
nothing to do with me.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.830
I'll leave it up to
you to decide.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.170
So I then became a
bit disillusioned

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.095
with mainstream finance.

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:54.270
You know, it wasn't
going that well.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.360
This was 10 years ago.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.630
Let's try something new.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.930
I'd only ever really worked as
an economist and in banking.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.200
So I figured, let's
do microfinances.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.930
It's finance-related,
it's technical, all

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.770
this sort of stuff.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.110
But hopefully I can
have an impact.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.150
So I sort of went into the
sector of this naive idea of,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.750
you know, let's try
and help the poor.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.550
So during this decade, I think
I spent 8 of the 10 years

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.530
living in developing
countries.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.640
So I'm not one of these people
who live in DC and fly to some

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.290
far-flung nation, take a couple
of photos, and then say

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.120
that I'm working
on development.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.540
I actually live in these
countries to this day.

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.247
And I guess the other thing I
need to do as a instruction is

00:02:32.247 --> 00:02:35.460
to say I'm a heretic now, thanks
to writing this book.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.480
I'm a whistleblower.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.460
And I'm enjoying all the
benefits of being fired by an

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.850
entire industry simultaneously,
which is a

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.140
quite unusual feeling.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.480
I'm going to just do a
lightning summary of

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:49.700
microfinance.

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.260
We all know what it is, this
idea of the woman with the

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.670
goat or the sewing machine.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.310
She gets the $100 loan.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.440
She builds up some business.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.790
And with the income from
that businesses,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:59.425
she gets out of poverty.

00:02:59.425 --> 00:03:02.270
She repays the loan, recycles
the loan to the next person.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.160
Everyone's a winner.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.030
We're all familiar
with this story.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.470
Now, the reality is that it is
actually very, very different.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.800
First of all, it should come as
no surprise that the vast

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.290
majority of people are not
a budding Bill Gates

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.570
entrepreneur.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.540
It's not so easy to actually
make very high returns in

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.580
developing countries when maybe
you have a very limited

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.340
education, you're operating in
fiercely competitive markets.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.270
It's actually really,
really difficult.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.380
And it should come as no
surprise that, you know, is

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.790
there much evidence of people
building up these huge

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.790
enterprises on the back
of a $200 loan?

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.150
Absolutely none whatsoever.

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.010
How much of the capital isn't
actually invested in the

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.230
business at all?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.880
It's very difficult to find
out how much money is used

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.630
simply for paying off getting
a loan from one bank to pay

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.126
off the next bank to pay off
the next bank to pay

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:48.060
off the next bank.

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.600
This sort of recycling of
credit, it's very difficult to

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.810
get estimates of that.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.920
It's very difficult to find out
how much microfinance is

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.490
actually just spent
on consumption.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:56.450
There are estimates.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.640
There was an estimate in the
"Harvard Business Review" a

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.800
few years ago suggesting it
might be as high as 90% is not

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.860
actually going into a
microenterprise at all.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.075
I think that's a bit
on the high side.

00:04:05.075 --> 00:04:09.740
But my gut feel is that it's
certainly at least 3/4 of all

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.540
microfinance is going nowhere
near a microenterprise.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.880
So of course it's not
having an impact.

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.210
It's not going to an enterprise
in the first place.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:19.640
Then there's been all the recent
cases, particularly in

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.640
Andhra Pradesh in India, of
really bad abuses of clients.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.800
There's been 54 suicides so far
which have been blamed by

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.180
the Indian government, published
reports just that

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.260
this was at the hands of
aggressive money lenders

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:34.660
disguised as microfinance
institutions, basically.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.030
There's been cases of women
forced into prostitution.

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:40.270
And there's been cases of
children being kidnapped as

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.170
collateral for loans.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.000
So we're talking, in the worst
cases, some pretty sordid

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.270
activities.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.570
But oh, we shouldn't forget,
child labor.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.300
Who do you think is actually
working in these small

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.240
microenterprise when they
suddenly have to increase

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.010
their production by 500% in
order just to cover the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.960
interest costs?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.940
When you suddenly go from
selling 20 tomatoes to 200

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.970
tomatoes, it's labor-intensive.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.430
Where do you get
the labor from?

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:08.120
Your own children.

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.960
So there is also now
growing evidence.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.945
There's been a few academic
papers looked into this, that

00:05:12.945 --> 00:05:16.340
are suggesting that, actually
microfinance and promoting

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:19.330
this informal economy might
actually be resulting in

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.940
children being taken out of
schools to work in what we

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.625
call microsweatshops.

00:05:23.625 --> 00:05:25.645
And if you think about it, it
would make complete sense that

00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:26.400
that happens.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.090
If you walk around one of these
poor markets in some

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:32.720
remote corner of Africa or in
Latin America at 2 o'clock in

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.230
the afternoon on a school
day, what do you see?

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.740
Kids running around
stacking shelves.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.170
So it's not really surprising
that this happens.

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:42.390
There's also some really
fundamental

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.640
problems with the model.

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.640
If you work on the supply side
of a market, if you increase

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:52.150
the number of people selling
tomatoes, sure, some of those

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.880
tomato vendors might actually
do very well.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.930
But the total number of tomatoes
being sold, the total

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.190
demand is not changing.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.310
Microfinance is on
the supply side.

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:03.920
So what about all those people
who are being displaced,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.780
people who used to sell tomatoes
and have now been

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.080
driven out of the business?

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.890
Because there's only so many
tomatoes for sale.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.890
So that whole aspect-- they call
it job displacement or

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:14.920
crowding out-- is completely
ignored by the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.930
microfinance community.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.780
They only focus on the people
who get the loans.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.140
There's no discussion of the
people who got displaced.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.220
It's like if you're analyzing
a national lottery and you

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:28.460
only interviewed the winners.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.870
You need to talk to the million
people who bought a

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:32.170
ticket and didn't win.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.830
This is just a little thing that
we just quietly forget.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.420
But then, above all, the
academic evidence.

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:41.160
There's been two really
big studies.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.820
David Roodman at the Center for
Global Development in DC

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.810
recently summarized it
very succinctly.

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.140
He said that the overall impact
of microfinance on

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:51.880
poverty reduction is zero.

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.090
And then Maren Duvendack, the
academic funded by the UK

00:06:55.090 --> 00:07:00.440
government in Britain, she
analyzed 2,836 academic papers

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.350
over the last 30 years and
concluded that microfinance

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.950
had no impact on poverty
reduction whatsoever.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.530
And actually, it may have been
a huge waste of time and a

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:11.825
missed opportunity, had we
actually used the money for

00:07:11.825 --> 00:07:12.530
something else.

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.170
So the literature is really
coming down hard against the

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:18.920
microfinance sector, which
is unfortunate.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.390
So I tried to fix this from the
inside, working in these

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:23.645
institutions, sort of pointing
these things out.

00:07:23.645 --> 00:07:24.840
Didn't work.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.480
So I started leaking stories
to media, hoping to attract

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.000
some attention.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.035
I actually got a story into
the front page of the "New

00:07:31.035 --> 00:07:35.820
York Times." Momentarily
interesting for a few people.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.190
You know, oh, that's cool.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.230
But it's called the rogue
operator argument.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:40.190
Oh no, there's another
bad one.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:41.133
Oh, there's a bad one.

00:07:41.133 --> 00:07:43.190
But the system, microfinance
overall is good.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.580
But yeah, every now and then,
there's a few exceptions.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:47.475
That's the way that
it's presented

00:07:47.475 --> 00:07:49.000
to the outside world.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.960
So what I decided to do was
actually just write a book and

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.120
explain that these are
not isolated cases.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.820
This is an actual systemic
flaw in the entire

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.165
microfinance sector.

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:00.510
So that's why I've
now been fired by

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.150
everyone in the world.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:03.510
What's unusual about the book?

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:06.540
I mean, really there's a subtle
shift of focus that

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:07.210
I've tried to do.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.044
There's been other books written
about microfinance.

00:08:10.044 --> 00:08:13.080
But this is the first one which
is written by an insider

00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.780
who's worked, often
to quite high

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:17.460
levels, within the sector.

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:20.030
And it's the first one to
really specifically name

00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:22.520
individual people and individual
companies very

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.090
clearly, entire total
transparency.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:29.840
Every single document and
audio recordings, video

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.429
footage, emails, every single
supporting document for the

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.630
entire book is online.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:38.919
Anyone can go on to the website
and check it out and

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:40.470
verify these things
for themselves.

00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.886
Because sometimes you're reading
the book, you're like,

00:08:41.886 --> 00:08:46.140
no, I don't believe that it
actually got that bad, or that

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.570
someone at that level of
seniority was doing these

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:49.545
sorts of actions.

00:08:49.545 --> 00:08:52.080
And all I just say to the reader
is, go to the website.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.520
You want to listen to the
entire phone call?

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.640
You can download the
entire call.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.730
The names, nothing is hidden.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:58.730
AUDIENCE: What's the website?

00:08:58.730 --> 00:08:59.820
HUGH SINCLAIR: Oh yeah,
the website's

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.070
microfinancetransparency.com.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.830
Yeah, so I detail who's
involved, how they did it, why

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:10.480
they did it, and how they
tried to cover it up.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.160
And given that I was actually
one of the people who did

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:17.040
these things and worked, to some
extent, on the cover-ups,

00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.300
I have fairly good information
on this.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.020
I didn't just look at the
individuals MFIs, the

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.500
individual institutions.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.660
But I tried to explain where
is the money coming from.

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.480
Who are the investors?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.400
Who is providing the
money for this?

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.060
How much information did they
know when they made these

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.370
certain investments?

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:35.310
I look at the role of
the rating agencies.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.700
I look at the role of
the regulators.

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:40.200
And then, importantly, the PR
companies, how do they take

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.006
this data and how do they spin
it to the world so that we all

00:09:43.006 --> 00:09:45.650
sort of think, oh, this is
wonderful, and we open our

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:46.900
wallets and we invest
more money?

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:53.100
My view of the main problem in
the microfinance sector is, in

00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.810
economics it's referred to as
the principal-agent problem.

00:09:55.810 --> 00:09:57.100
You've got money.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:00.090
And you can't invest it directly
yourself into an

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.700
individual microentrepreneur.

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.670
So you have to go through
an institution.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.340
I mean, examples in the US are
Grameen Foundation USA,

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:12.850
Calvert Foundation, Kiva,
Deutsche Bank Microcredit

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:14.890
Fund, Citibank, Standard
Chartered.

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:16.830
All these people have
microfinance funds.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.430
Or they facilitate you getting
your money from your pocket to

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.690
the poor people.

00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:27.130
My basic premise is, how can
we ensure that those

00:10:27.130 --> 00:10:30.250
intermediaries are acting in our
best interest and the best

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.400
interest of the poor?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.720
In any other area of business,
in any other area of finance,

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:35.800
the principal agent problem
is considered

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.380
to be a huge obstacle.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.955
In microfinance, apparently
it doesn't exist.

00:10:39.955 --> 00:10:41.600
It is a complete myth.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.140
There's absolutely no reason to
believe that the person who

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.430
you trust your money with
when you're trying to do

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.210
microfinance investment
is acting

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.050
in their best interests.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:54.090
That is the only thing you
can be truly sure of.

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:56.750
Those do not necessarily match
up with the interests of the

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.790
poor or your own interests.

00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:01.590
And then what I tried to do is
I tried to provide a roadmap

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:02.180
for people.

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.210
So instead of just saying, well,
these are good, these

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:08.560
are bad, what I tried to do is
explain to the reader, OK,

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.955
this is how you can go and find
out if the vehicle that

00:11:11.955 --> 00:11:14.840
you're using, the intermediary
you're using is good or bad.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:17.660
This is how you would see a
good institution, a good

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.480
microfinance bank
from a bad one.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:23.340
These are the sorts of questions
you need to ask.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.790
These are the kind of responses
that you've gotta be

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:26.710
listening out for.

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.170
And if you get told things--
for example, we don't know

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:33.020
what the interest rate is, we
can't actually tell you what

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:36.210
the interest rate is because
of some technical reason--

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:39.370
these are like big
alarm bells.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:40.712
Be careful.

00:11:40.712 --> 00:11:45.570
So what I tried to do is help
people to be empowered to make

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:46.330
the right decisions.

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:49.060
Because at the end of the day,
there are two groups of people

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.600
who are being exploited
in microenterprise.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.000
There's the poor.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.250
And there are you guys, you guys
who believe that you're

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:57.340
doing something useful.

00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:57.970
And you trust it.

00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:00.850
You have the best intentions
to try and do something to

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:01.730
help the poor.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:04.540
So in actual fact, you're being
duped just as much as

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.180
the woman who signs a contract
and suddenly finds out she's

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.340
paying 195% interest a year.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.032
There's two angles to it.

00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:17.300
Right, I'm not going
to summarize the

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:18.090
book in any more detail.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.330
What I'm gonna talk about is how
did we get into this mess.

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:25.640
How did we arrive in a situation
where we're making

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.680
loans to poor people at 195%
interest and we're believing

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.130
that we're helping people
get out of poverty?

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.440
I mean, if you think
about it, it's

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.160
completely ridiculous, really.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.220
And we sort of think, well, if
this company that is charging

00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:43.760
195% interest a year does an IPO
and individual people make

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.080
multimillion-dollar packages--

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.280
Accion, on a $1 million
investment in the IPO of

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.730
Compartamos, made
$270 million.

00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:54.360
That's a very, very
decent return.

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.760
If you look at what interest
rates the poor are paying--

00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:00.010
195% is the maximum rates
in that particular bank.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.460
And no one's putting two and two
together and saying, hmm,

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:05.030
maybe it's the poor people
paying so much interest which

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:07.550
made these people make
so much money.

00:13:07.550 --> 00:13:08.710
So how did we get here?

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.700
It's actually completely
ridiculous.

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.250
It's so against what Muhammad
Yunus originally said.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.830
Let's use affordable
credit to help

00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:17.460
people get out of poverty.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:18.270
It's not happening.

00:13:18.270 --> 00:13:21.000
But how did it get this bad?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.540
So I think there are a number
of reasons to explain this.

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:26.360
I think, first of all,
it's the idea.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.440
We love the idea.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.970
It sounds so beautiful,
that it's self-help.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.005
It's empowerment.

00:13:32.005 --> 00:13:34.820
It's harnessing the
entrepreneurial flair.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.410
It's the triple bottom
line, bottom of the

00:13:37.410 --> 00:13:40.620
pyramid, social business.

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.290
It touches all the right buttons
that we want to hear.

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:46.480
And it's just a nice story.

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:49.080
It's compatible with our
view of the world.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.280
Competition is a good thing/
it's gonna bring about

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.330
wonderful outcomes.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:55.900
We can solve all the world's
problems with this kind of

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:59.186
free market, neoliberal
economic strategy.

00:13:59.186 --> 00:14:03.050
Not that it's doing particularly
well right now.

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:06.160
But I think, above all, there
was a sort of growing

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.330
discontent with traditional aid,
which is best summarized

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:11.090
[INAUDIBLE], don't give
the man a fish,

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.490
teach the man to fish.

00:14:12.490 --> 00:14:17.870
It was this kind of normal aid
in the last century, people

00:14:17.870 --> 00:14:19.110
were sort of getting
a bit tired of it.

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:20.135
It didn't seem to really
be working.

00:14:20.135 --> 00:14:21.150
It wasn't so nice.

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:23.050
You're just giving away money.

00:14:23.050 --> 00:14:25.310
So they were disillusioned.

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.250
There was a sudden
disillusionment with

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.340
traditional aid.

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.630
And then microfinance
came along.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.350
And it was new.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:31.450
And it was cool.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:33.020
And it was kind of innovative.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.110
And it harnessed all
these things.

00:14:34.110 --> 00:14:35.760
And people were ready
for something new.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.470
So they just jumped onto
the bandwagon.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:40.490
The problem is that there's
no transparency.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.290
There's no regulation
whatsoever.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.640
When you make a loan in India,
there is actually no one

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.280
sitting there, protecting the
rights of the Indian client.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.330
There are now, because they
were committing suicide.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:54.050
And the Indian regulators
stepped in.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.080
But when you make a loan in
these countries, there's no

00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.970
one looking over the shoulder
of the poor

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:58.940
person, protecting them.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.170
It's totally and utterly
unregulated.

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:04.120
Women are signing contracts
with their fingerprints,

00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:05.610
because they can't
read and write.

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:09.550
And in the contract, they are
giving away all their rights.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:11.940
You can come in, and you can
take the last piece of tin off

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:12.510
their roof.

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:14.060
And they agreed to it.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:15.980
There is no one protecting
their interests.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.540
In the US, who is regulating
the institutions that are

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:21.830
taking the money from
the general public?

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:23.140
No one.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.946
There's absolutely no one.

00:15:23.946 --> 00:15:26.440
If you think that because
Deutsche Bank is

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:28.785
SEC-regulated, that that means
Deutsche Bank Microcredit

00:15:28.785 --> 00:15:30.920
Funds, someone's actually
looking over their shoulder

00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.180
and actually investigating what
they're investing in in

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:38.190
India, in Mexico, in Bolivia,
in Nigeria, just dream on.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.720
There's no regulation.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.720
So I mean, it's not really a
huge surprise that we ended up

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.380
in this situation.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.210
We then got this slightly
ridiculous thing going on in

00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:49.640
the UK right now-- you know,
with the Libor scandal.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.390
These people are tweaking the
interest rates by a hundredth

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:53.150
of a percent.

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:56.030
And everyone's up in
arms about this.

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:59.150
The whole European Union is now
saying, oh, Spain's gonna

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.960
have to pay 7% interest
a year.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.620
And this is enough to actually
bankrupt the entire EU,

00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:05.690
potentially.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:10.424
And yet we expect the poor to
pay interest rates of 80%,

00:16:10.424 --> 00:16:13.830
100%, 150%, 195%.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:17.730
If you think about it, it's
completely ridiculous.

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:20.690
But the reason is that there's
massive profit to be made from

00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.480
microfinance.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.870
And this is the thing which
people are slightly

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:24.380
forgetting.

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.890
We think that making profit is
going to attract the new

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.520
investors, and that this is
going to result in a more

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.475
competitive market, and all
this sort of stuff.

00:16:31.475 --> 00:16:33.640
We buy this ideology.

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.700
But let's not put the horse
before the cart.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.230
The bottom line is, people
are being attracted to

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:41.330
microfinance because in
a totally unregulated

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.450
environment, they can make
extremely high returns.

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.330
This is the bottom line.

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:49.740
And I think the other reason why
we're in this mess is this

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:54.135
kind of soundbite culture
that has emerged.

00:16:54.135 --> 00:16:56.190
There's massive marketing
campaigns promoting

00:16:56.190 --> 00:16:57.310
microfinance.

00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:58.170
We've got people like--

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:58.910
I don't know if you're aware of

00:16:58.910 --> 00:17:02.450
Burson-Marstellar, the PR company.

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:05.284
Rachel Maddow in her
show summarized it.

00:17:05.284 --> 00:17:09.240
She said, when evil needs PR,
evil has Burson-Marstellar on

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:09.845
speed dial.

00:17:09.845 --> 00:17:12.119
These are the guys who did
Union Carbide, General

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:16.890
Pinochet, that favorite,
Big Tobacco.

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.190
Who else did?

00:17:18.190 --> 00:17:21.810
All the bad dudes, the people
who did the Facebook smear

00:17:21.810 --> 00:17:23.890
campaign against you guys,
I believe, that was

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:25.410
Burson-Marstellar.

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:27.540
These are the people who
are now defending the

00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:28.970
microfinance sector.

00:17:28.970 --> 00:17:30.520
They're working with
friends of Grameen.

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:31.825
There's this huge
kind of spin.

00:17:31.825 --> 00:17:34.150
Oh, get images on to
people's screens.

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:36.490
Tell them we need another
500 pictures of

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.710
women with sewing machines.

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.610
This will make it
all blow over.

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:41.470
And people have limited
attention spans.

00:17:41.470 --> 00:17:43.300
You know, they see these pieces
of bad news and they

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.400
go, oh well, it was on
"The Simpsons." The

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.870
guy got a Nobel Prize.

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:51.290
Oprah Winfrey interviewed them,
so it's probably OK.

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:52.540
I'll keep on giving the money.

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.240
No one's actually looking
into the details.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.630
No one's actually stopping and
just saying, hang on, let me

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:02.820
just take stock of this.

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.670
Does this make sense?

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.960
What is the evidence?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:08.700
And there's no one actually
answering the one key problem,

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.090
which is, it's not working.

00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:13.060
I mean, you'd think that that
would attract some attention.

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:13.510
No.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:15.920
Those sorts of conversations
are prohibited.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.610
We're not allowed to talk about
the fact it doesn't

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.930
actually work.

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:24.750
So I think that sort of explains
maybe how we arrived

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:26.690
in this worrying situation.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.410
The sector is now estimated
at about $70 billion.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.270
It's 200 million clients now,
growing at a million a week,

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:35.930
or a million a month
or something.

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.460
And the microfinance community,
particularly the

00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:40.880
investment community, has
got very clear goals.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.060
We want to get to a billion.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.540
There's a billion people
out there.

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.150
They all need a credit card.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.410
They're all unregulated.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:48.490
And hey, we can make some decent
profit out of them,

00:18:48.490 --> 00:18:50.900
because we don't have these
annoying regulators that we

00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:52.750
have in Europe and the United
States who are gonna actually

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:54.960
start exercising people's
rights.

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.930
So we can just charge them
whatever we want.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:19:00.403
And there's a billion new
people to profit from.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.970
So whistleblowing.

00:19:05.970 --> 00:19:10.400
What happens when you blow the
whistle on an entire industry?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.820
First of all, I can tell you,
it's deeply stressful.

00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.720
This has been, I think, one
of the toughest six

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.520
months of my life.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.880
The last month has
been total hell.

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.470
Thank god I'm actually leaving
in a few days, going home.

00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:26.330
I can't wait to put this
all behind me.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.810
Getting fired by the
entire sector--

00:19:30.810 --> 00:19:32.690
the sector, it's slightly
unusual.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.200
Because generally what they
do when whistleblowers--

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.560
there's been a couple of people
who have dared to

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.280
criticize it.

00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:40.280
Usually they come out
guns blazing.

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.100
There's been a case of
academics having

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:43.960
their funding cut.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.870
We've had two threats.

00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.370
The second threat was on
our home phone number.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.630
And we ended up moving house
shortly afterwards.

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:52.850
You get blacklisted
from conferences.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:54.850
No one will reply
to your emails.

00:19:54.850 --> 00:19:58.320
And it's weird, because on the
one hand, some friends, some

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:00.520
people that you believed were
friends, actually turn around

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.680
and stab you in the back, which
is a bit disappointing.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.800
But the thing which is actually
really nice is that

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:07.255
I've had some really great
support from random people I

00:20:07.255 --> 00:20:10.180
would never have thought of
calling up and saying, OK,

00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:12.070
what can we do to
clean this up?

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:16.660
People that maybe I never
thought would actually dare to

00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:19.690
come out and try to clean
up, they have.

00:20:19.690 --> 00:20:22.860
I mean, it's been
very surprising.

00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:25.090
The support has come from
unusual places.

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.260
And the betrayals have come
from unusual places--

00:20:27.260 --> 00:20:28.510
sometimes quite disappointing,
to be honest.

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:35.970
But what's unusual about this
one, I think partly because of

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:40.210
the transparency, partly
because of the website,

00:20:40.210 --> 00:20:42.910
because all the evidence is out
there, this whistleblowing

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.810
exercise has been slightly
different to former critics in

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.120
that the entire sector
has just gone silent.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:50.550
No one has done anything.

00:20:50.550 --> 00:20:54.900
I was in DC, which is home to
some of the people most

00:20:54.900 --> 00:20:56.335
implicated in the book--

00:20:56.335 --> 00:20:58.600
World Relief, Grameen
Foundation USA--

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.640
actually who Google supports,
just to mention it--

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:04.170
and Calvert Foundation.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:05.840
I was expecting to have
eggs thrown at me.

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:10.420
In actual fact didn't, which
was rather nice.

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:12.640
And I think basically now the
sector is in just complete

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:13.320
lock-down mode.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.680
No one's issuing a
press release.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.400
No one's answering
phone calls.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.050
No one's replying to emails.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:19.300
It's just silence.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.220
We don't want to give any
more oxygen to this.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.020
We don't want anyone
to discuss this.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.070
If we dare to actually
criticize the

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.440
book, on what grounds?

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.410
And then we're going to
get into a debate.

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.550
And it's going to be
put on the table.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:33.970
And it's going to attract
attention.

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:36.370
So basically now the sector is
just saying, we've gotta hush

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:39.410
this up totally.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:40.480
So I don't know.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:43.410
I don't know really how to
explain the complete silence

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.560
of the people implicated
in the book.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.660
I actually anticipated in
the book, these are the

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.850
traditional methods that they
use, the smear campaigns.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:53.760
This is the way they normally
attack their critics.

00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:56.240
These are the examples of
individual critics who have

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.440
been blacklisted and had these
campaigns against them.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.270
And it hasn't happened.

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.150
So actually if you want to
criticize the book, that's a

00:22:02.150 --> 00:22:03.070
good point to criticize.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.720
I was completely wrong
on that one.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.860
I don't know why it is.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:09.250
I mean, the only thing that I
can consume is that their

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.483
lawyers have said, you know
what, there's no point in

00:22:12.483 --> 00:22:12.790
defending this.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:15.850
You're just gonna have to
let this blow over.

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:17.100
So what can we do?

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:18.130
How can we solve the problem?

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.820
I think the first thing
is transparency.

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:26.400
This is the most opaque, murky
sector that I believe exists

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.730
possibly on the planet,
certainly

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:29.850
within financial services.

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:31.630
When you do an investment,
when you get given that

00:22:31.630 --> 00:22:33.880
photograph of the person you
supposedly invested in, when

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.690
you look at your microfinance
investment fund and they give

00:22:36.690 --> 00:22:41.110
you the glossy brochure, I mean,
it's total pure spin.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:46.110
There's absolutely no flow
of information from

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:47.770
the field to you.

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:48.900
It doesn't even exist.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.590
Most of these banks don't even
know who they're lending to.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:54.930
They don't even capture data
on their own clients.

00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:58.310
So it's absolutely ridiculous
that, in America, they say, oh

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:03.200
yes, we've helped 2,463,914
female entrepreneurs.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:04.910
They don't even know
if they're female.

00:23:04.910 --> 00:23:05.920
They don't know if they're
entrepreneurs.

00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.340
The evidence is that most of
them aren't doing anything

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:08.820
entrepreneurial whatsoever.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.870
It's just total,
complete spin.

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.960
There's absolutely zero
regulation, like I say.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.000
And until that changes,
there's going to be no

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.070
improvement.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:19.640
The self-regulatory
bodies are--

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.750
what would you call it?

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.860
Endorsement without
enforcement.

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:25.540
If you want to get endorsed in
the microfinance sector as

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:29.670
being an ethical person who
adheres to the six client

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.540
protection principles
of microfinance--

00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:34.645
protection of the client, fair
interest rates-- the only

00:23:34.645 --> 00:23:36.670
thing you need to do to get
the endorsement to the

00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:38.950
equivalent of a fair trade
coffee stamp on the back of

00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:42.060
your coffee pot, you need
to have an email

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.630
address and a name.

00:23:43.630 --> 00:23:46.410
Soon as you can do those two
things, you can then shove on

00:23:46.410 --> 00:23:49.040
your website, we've endorsed
the Smart Campaign.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.960
And then everyone goes,
oh, that's so nice.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.820
So you must be treating your
clients well, wonderful.

00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:55.420
I'll give you another
1,000 euros.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:59.010
So self-regulation is
a complete joke.

00:23:59.010 --> 00:24:01.380
And actual regulation
doesn't exist.

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.030
So that's just a couple
of little problems.

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:07.050
Now obviously the people who
are resisting any form of

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.920
regulation, no surprise who
they are, namely the

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.650
microfinance investment funds.

00:24:12.650 --> 00:24:16.540
Those intermediaries that we are
hoping are acting in your

00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.360
best interests and the best
interests of the poor are the

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.130
first people to say, no,
regulation is evil.

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.460
We have to have free markets.

00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.290
Any kind of regulation
is gonna interfere

00:24:27.290 --> 00:24:28.100
with the poor people.

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:29.660
And they're not going to
get as much money.

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:32.780
There is a wonderful case
in SKS recently.

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:37.550
I don't know if any of you are
aware of SKS, Vikram Akula,

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.890
very large Indian microfinance
institution which did an IPO a

00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:43.230
couple of years ago.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:45.560
14 times oversubscribed,
the biggest IPO in

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:47.110
microfinance history.

00:24:47.110 --> 00:24:51.490
Made many people many
millions of dollars.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.750
When the Indian government
started regulating them, the

00:24:53.750 --> 00:24:55.960
share price fell 95%.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.725
And a few days ago, there was
a lovely little news piece.

00:24:58.725 --> 00:25:03.630
It said, SKS share price
increases by 50% as government

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:05.810
relaxes regulation.

00:25:05.810 --> 00:25:07.540
There is an inverse
relationship.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.030
More regulation, bad
for investors.

00:25:10.030 --> 00:25:11.660
It means you're not gonna be
able to exploit the poor

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:12.560
people so much.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:15.350
You're actually going to have
to do some sort of ethical

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:16.125
treatment of them.

00:25:16.125 --> 00:25:17.570
You're not gonna be able
to charge them such

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.090
high interest rates.

00:25:19.090 --> 00:25:21.280
And that's not very good
for investors.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.150
I mean, the correlation
is quite uncanny.

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.900
There is already some increased
scrutiny coming from

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:29.520
regulators, which is
really encouraging.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.240
I mean, I've already had
regulators calling me up and

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.330
saying, what can we do?

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.130
How do we do this?

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:36.900
Where do we need to be focusing
our attention?

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:38.830
So I mean, maybe there are
some good signs that the

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.900
regulators are stepping
up to the plate.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:44.370
But until that happens, I remain
fairly pessimistic.

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.230
But I think one of the things
which is actually really

00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.110
good-- and given that this is
Google, I think it's worth

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:50.470
mentioning this--

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.095
is, what is the role
of technology?

00:25:53.095 --> 00:25:57.420
And actually, technology is
already having a big impact in

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.570
improving microfinance, and
could potentially have a much

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:01.770
bigger impact.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:03.610
The last thing is I'm just gonna
touch on some of the

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:06.025
areas where technology's
having a good impact.

00:26:06.025 --> 00:26:10.270
First of all, cloud-based
IT systems.

00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:14.240
The software that these banks
use to operate their

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:17.220
operations is actually
surprisingly complicated.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.280
You've got millions, high-volume
of transactions.

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.010
You've got interest and
capital repayments.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:25.600
And it is actually surprisingly
complicated, just

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.850
because of the sheer volume.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:30.230
And these people are repaying
their loans weekly, sometimes

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.920
even daily.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.520
So you can imagine the actual
information flow is vast.

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:37.090
So IT problems in the field are
really difficult, because

00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:39.060
you can't always
get good staff.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.290
You've got problems of
computer viruses.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.340
You don't have a very high level
of education in many of

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:42.730
the places.

00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.460
So it's difficult to
really manage it.

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:47.700
Now you've got the
first cloud-based

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.650
systems are being operated.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:51.060
And in fact, one of them--

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:53.000
I believe it's called Mambu,
in Germany-- is

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.280
hosted by you guys.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.700
So this actually gives a way
not only for improved IT,

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.760
which means improved control,
which means less fraud, which

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:04.970
means more tracking of the
actual activities.

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:09.080
But it gives the investors in
the US and Europe, it gives

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.210
the regulators, it gives the
rating agencies a way to

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:14.350
actually look into what's
really going on in the

00:27:14.350 --> 00:27:16.700
institution much more closely.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:17.770
Obviously they need
permission.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.950
But a bank can say to its
investors, give us a few

00:27:20.950 --> 00:27:21.380
million dollars.

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.640
But what we'll do is we'll allow
you access to our IT

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.380
systems so you can
log in remotely.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.740
And you can actually watch
what's happening.

00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:28.700
And this is happening now.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:30.930
I've been in the offices of
this company in Germany.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:32.350
And you actually see
transactions

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:33.870
coming in in real time.

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:36.530
You see credit application
process being posted.

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.810
And you can actually see
who's regulating it.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:39.850
Oh, that looks a bit dodgy.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:42.080
I want to stop that
one right now.

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:45.190
This additional scrutiny
is a really good thing.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.510
One of the things which we're
doing now is we're using--

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:49.530
I'm originally an
econometrician.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:52.200
We're using some of the
econometrics and statistical

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.700
analysis that is traditionally
used by credit card companies

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:59.620
to analyze their portfolios and
work out characteristics

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:02.090
of well-performing clients,
poorly performing clients.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.500
This kind of technology, which
is well-developed, we're now

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:06.590
using this in microfinance.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:11.240
So combining that with
cloud-based IT systems is

00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:13.170
potentially very,
very powerful.

00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:17.920
So we're able to, for example,
analyze databases and see, OK,

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.930
these are the types of clients
who are actually really

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.720
benefiting from microfinance.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.000
These people are actually
suffering from microfinance.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.160
We can come up with very, very
precise suggestions on how the

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.330
bank can skew its entire
operations so that it's doing

00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:34.490
more of the good microfinance
and less of the bad

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.640
microfinance.

00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:37.620
And we can do this without
visiting the bank.

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:40.650
And if, as more institutions go
into cloud-based systems,

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.600
we get a bigger and bigger
data set, then we can

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.120
potentially do some very
interesting analysis.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:46.290
So I mean, that's one
good example.

00:28:46.290 --> 00:28:48.910
Obviously mobile technology
is the big

00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:52.180
buzzword at the moment.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:53.980
Poor people do now
have cell phones.

00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.560
And increasingly they're
actually using smartphones as

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.150
the price has come down.

00:28:58.150 --> 00:29:00.300
And it's cool to have
a smartphone.

00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.145
Even if you can't afford to
put food on the table,

00:29:02.145 --> 00:29:03.710
everyone wants a smartphone.

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:07.070
So a surprising number
of people have them.

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.780
So this originally was being
used for money transfers,

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:13.510
M-Pesa, the virtual money
in East Africa,

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:14.620
those sorts of things.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.950
But actually now there's a bank
called Musoni, which is

00:29:17.950 --> 00:29:20.870
the first completely virtual
microfinance institution,

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:21.910
based in Kenya.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:23.580
And I think they do
operations in a

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:24.700
couple of other countries.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.280
So they're actually a branchless
bank that does all

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.850
its loan disbursements, loan
repayments, completely and

00:29:29.850 --> 00:29:31.380
utterly by cell phones.

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.420
Now the good thing about these
smartphones is that it's not

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.420
just that the poor can do
transactions on them and that

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:39.860
they can do them in a
much cheaper way.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.950
The banks don't have to have big
branch networks and lots

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:45.340
of staff running around
collecting loans.

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.450
But it also is a way that we
can get information to the

00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:49.380
poor people.

00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:52.230
So for example, we're all used
to here, whenever you want to

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.380
buy something, you
go on to Google.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:56.040
And you compare the prices.

00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:57.395
And you can see where you
can get the best deal

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.900
for whatever it is.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:01.190
Poor people need to be able
to shop around for

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.030
the interest rates.

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.740
Where is actually the best
place to get a loan?

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.700
And it sounds like a really
simple thing.

00:30:07.700 --> 00:30:10.120
But that information is
not available to them.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:13.870
Ironically, if you're sitting
in the US and you know where

00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:17.870
to go, I can find out all the
information of the best

00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:20.890
microfinance institutions in
Uganda for this particular

00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:23.470
person, for this particular
purpose of loan.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:25.680
I can work that out from here.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.980
The problem is is that the poor
people don't have access

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:28.700
to that information.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:30.500
As they start using phones,
they're gonna have

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.600
more access to this.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:33.370
So that could potentially
have quite a big impact.

00:30:36.390 --> 00:30:38.680
The use of mobile phones
and the use of improved

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.870
technology, it reduces the
fraud, because fraud in

00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:43.970
microfinance is chronic.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:48.560
And the ability to actually
track the flow of money right

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:52.820
actually from the source, right
the way through to the

00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.080
audited statements, it makes
fraud a lot more difficult.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:57.580
It doesn't make it impossible.

00:30:57.580 --> 00:30:59.170
And accounting fraud is
still a big problem.

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:04.410
But it's definitely cleaning up
the act and holding people

00:31:04.410 --> 00:31:05.540
more comfortable.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.860
And one of the things
which we're doing--

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.510
I work with an institution
down in South America.

00:31:09.510 --> 00:31:11.760
We're using GPS now.

00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760
So we use Google Maps.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.160
And we can actually see, in
real time, where our loan

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:15.830
officers are.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.620
We can track them.

00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.050
We can optimize their routes to
go and visit their clients

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.540
so that they're not
wasting time.

00:31:22.540 --> 00:31:24.210
Thank you very much for Google
Earth, by the way.

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:28.050
That was a really
good invention.

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.020
And we can also track.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.300
If we see loan officers spending
too much time in a

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:36.370
certain region, we can literally
say, hang on, this

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:37.840
guy's in a bar.

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.660
That's not a client.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:42.590
There might be a little alarm
bell ringing here.

00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:45.150
Sometimes the loan officers
get a bit annoyed when we

00:31:45.150 --> 00:31:46.030
point this out to them.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.100
They say that we're
following them.

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:47.780
And we're like, yep.

00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:49.430
And look, you can see.

00:31:49.430 --> 00:31:50.710
You can follow yourself
if you want.

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.830
It's completely open.

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.690
Anyone can log in.

00:31:53.690 --> 00:31:55.765
Another thing is
credit bureaus.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.490
Historically, there weren't
really credit bureaus in

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.290
developing countries.

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.360
Now because they can get hold
of the technology relatively

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:08.290
easily, the software for
managing this vast quantity of

00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:12.970
data, now institutions can log
in and see the credit history

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:16.120
of even very, very poor people
who are traditionally not even

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:21.040
mentioned in any part of
the formal sector.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.320
And then the final thing is,
what we're doing now is we're

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:30.280
trying to launch a kind of
WikiLeaks-style support for

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:32.820
whistleblowers in the
microfinance sector.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.820
And this is potentially a
very interesting thing.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:38.630
Because people within the
microfinance community, we all

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:41.120
know that this is going on.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.360
But it's very difficult.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.190
If you try to complain in the
microfinance institution to

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.070
your boss-- you know, like, uh,
don't you think it's a bit

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:50.710
dodgy treating the women
this aggressively?

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:52.980
You just get fired.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.710
The interest rates seem a bit
high, and we're telling our

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:58.350
investors that we're charging
36% interest rate.

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:00.540
But it's actually 136%.

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:02.490
There's some ethical questions
there maybe.

00:33:02.490 --> 00:33:03.960
I'm not sure if this is
completely transparent.

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.930
You just get fired.

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:10.400
So what we're hoping now is that
now that there is enough

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:13.220
critical mass of people who are
willing to stand up and

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.270
criticize microfinance that we
can start capturing this data

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:18.310
directly from the people
within the microfinance

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.040
investment funds and the people
within the microfinance

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:23.760
institutions on the ground,
where they have a way to

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.950
actually send us information.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:28.265
And obviously we have
to check everything.

00:33:28.265 --> 00:33:30.790
But as we start seeing patterns
emerging in certain

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.420
institutions, this can be like
the fuel that will tell us,

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:38.440
OK, this is where we need
to direct our attention.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.290
We know journalists in these
different countries.

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.730
We can direct the journalists
to the right people.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:44.530
And we can do this
anonymously.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.630
So this is one element where
we're hoping to use technology

00:33:47.630 --> 00:33:50.930
to actually improve
the sector.

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:54.590
By way of conclusion,
microfinance, it's not

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:55.430
working very well.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:56.480
But it can work.

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:59.230
I really believe that
we can fix this.

00:33:59.230 --> 00:34:02.270
I know a lot of really
good institutions.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:05.085
Microfinance investment funds,
I'm hard-pressed to think of

00:34:05.085 --> 00:34:06.470
one that is actually any good.

00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:08.579
But maybe there's one or two.

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:11.000
And the lending platforms,
there are

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.415
one or two good ones.

00:34:12.415 --> 00:34:13.989
But it does work.

00:34:13.989 --> 00:34:16.600
The model is proven
to be working.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.590
If you've got the right
incentive, if your goal is to

00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:23.560
help poor people, and make a
modest amount of profit, then

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:24.290
you can do that.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.409
And there are hundreds of
examples of it happening.

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.415
Unfortunately there
aren't 10,000

00:34:28.415 --> 00:34:29.639
examples of it happening.

00:34:29.639 --> 00:34:32.230
And it is the minority of cases
where it's working.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:33.583
But I think we can fix it.

00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:35.300
And I remain very optimistic.

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:39.130
But we need to start focusing
on poverty and not

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.110
on return on equity.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:45.080
Return on equity will always
lead to high interest rates

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.010
and bad treatment
of the clients.

00:34:47.010 --> 00:34:47.929
They go hand in hand.

00:34:47.929 --> 00:34:48.610
There's no other way.

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:49.840
It's not an opinion.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.760
It's a fact.

00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:52.800
If you want to make more money
out of lending to someone, you

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.370
need to charge them a higher
interest rate.

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.760
And I guess my final concluding
statement is, if

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.040
you're going to invest in
microfinance, be very, very,

00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.580
very careful, and ask really
penetrating questions to the

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.810
people that you're trusting
with your money.

00:35:08.810 --> 00:35:11.654
Because otherwise you
will be duped.

00:35:11.654 --> 00:35:12.618
Thank you.

00:35:12.618 --> 00:35:14.546
And questions?

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:18.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:19.890
MALE SPEAKER: Hugh will be glad
to take your questions.

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:21.930
Please step up to the mic so
the people at the remote

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:25.708
offices and on YouTube
can hear you.

00:35:25.708 --> 00:35:28.050
AUDIENCE: Since I'm closest
to the microphone.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:31.760
So a couple of weeks ago, we
had the founder of kiva.org

00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:34.670
here, who gives a good talk.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:37.390
And early in your discussion,
you said that there were quite

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:39.960
a few academic studies that said
microfinance doesn't work

00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.440
or hasn't worked.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:43.780
Did they indicate that it
doesn't work because the

00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.110
system is just corrupt and
unregulated, but in theory it

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.660
could, as you sort
of mentioned in

00:35:48.660 --> 00:35:51.200
your concluding statement?

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.460
HUGH SINCLAIR: If you
look at the academic

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:55.810
research, it's divided.

00:35:55.810 --> 00:35:59.130
So there are a lot of papers
that say microfinance is a

00:35:59.130 --> 00:35:59.620
great thing.

00:35:59.620 --> 00:36:00.970
It's the miracle cure
for poverty.

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:02.360
And we've got all this
evidence to support

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.410
that it's the case.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.360
There are lot of other papers
that say it's terrible.

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.450
It's hurting the poor.

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.030
So it's not to say that there's
no agreement at all.

00:36:09.030 --> 00:36:10.290
It's a huge spectrum.

00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.310
I mean, the two people in
particular, David Roodman and

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.560
Maren Duvendack, who are the
people who really, really

00:36:17.560 --> 00:36:20.540
rigorously analyzed the entirety
of the sector, their

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.900
overall conclusion was that it
doesn't work, which is a lot

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:25.680
of people are actually doing
really good microfinance.

00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.630
A lot of people are doing
really bad microfinance.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:29.700
And on average, it
doesn't work.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:31.610
That is the conclusion.

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:33.700
Now, I'm not an academic.

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.070
I haven't read the--

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:38.860
I mean, Maren Duvendack
read 2,836 papers.

00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:42.520
I couldn't imagine worse than
getting through even 20 of

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:43.720
those papers.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.980
But the problem isn't
necessarily because of

00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.000
microeconomic problems that are
happening on the ground,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.210
but also because of the
investment funds.

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.990
The people who are channeling
the money

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.910
have a twisted incentive.

00:36:57.910 --> 00:37:00.570
They don't actually have an
incentive necessarily to seek

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.450
out the microfinance that does
work, because of this thing,

00:37:03.450 --> 00:37:05.420
the principal-agent problem.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:09.850
So I mean, a number of people
are now saying, OK, we need to

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:11.910
start focusing on the
flow of money.

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.980
Because just by looking down
here, there's just so much

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.000
complexity.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.750
There's just so many--
what is it?

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.290
10,000 microfinance
institutions.

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:20.620
Each one is slightly
different.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:21.810
Each one's doing something.

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:23.800
It's very difficult
to really ask why.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:26.630
But common sense alone
is enough.

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.760
If you go into a market and you
say, OK, I'm gonna lend to

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:32.290
all the people on this side
of the room, you're

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.220
all gonna get loans.

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.920
So you get your loans
and you work hard.

00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:40.070
And you're gonna have to work
very hard, because the first

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:44.970
100% return on your investment
is just to pay me interest.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.600
But let's say that you work
even harder, even

00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.650
harder, even harder.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:49.700
Well, what about these guys?

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.810
They're just getting
crowded out.

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.480
They're just getting displaced,
because you're now

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.930
selling so many tomatoes that
these guys can't operate.

00:37:55.930 --> 00:37:58.260
Now when you go to the academics
and you say, OK, let

00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:02.240
me have a look at what are
your papers doing, until

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.560
recently, when they started
doing random control trials,

00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:07.910
they tended to look only at this
side of the room, which

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:09.585
is, in a way, completely
flawed.

00:38:09.585 --> 00:38:13.160
I mean, where is the increase
in aggregate demand?

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.340
If the total number of tomatoes
doesn't increase, it

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:19.130
doesn't really matter who's
benefiting, because it's a

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:21.030
zero-sum game at the
end of the day.

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:24.760
Now obviously you can increase
the demand if you lend to the

00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.380
consumers, the consumer
finance.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.720
But then you're creating a
completely artificial market.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.190
You're lending money
to the suppliers.

00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:35.000
And you're lending money
to the demanders.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.590
And you create a big bubble.

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:40.500
And this is what we saw in the
Nicaragua, for example.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:41.830
The funds just flooded in.

00:38:41.830 --> 00:38:45.120
They pumped in, I think
it was $420 million.

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.960
And what was happening was
the loans were just being

00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.350
recycled, one after the other,
after the other.

00:38:49.350 --> 00:38:52.410
The suppliers were often
also the demanders.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:54.800
Everyone was operating on both
sides of the market.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:58.720
And this huge credit bubble
was just created, and just

00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.180
inflated more and more and more
and more, without any

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.630
regulatory oversight,
as usual.

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:04.780
And eventually what happened?

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:09.150
You had 30 people just said, two
banks tried to imprison 30

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:10.950
people in the north
of Nicaragua, in

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:11.653
Jalapa, I think it was.

00:39:11.653 --> 00:39:13.750
And they put them in prison.

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:14.890
And they said, you didn't
repay your loans.

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:16.150
So you're going to prison.

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.730
And their families rebelled.

00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:19.610
Then everyone in the
community rebelled.

00:39:19.610 --> 00:39:20.850
Then everyone in the
region rebelled.

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.680
And then it spread right the
way across Nicaragua.

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.190
And it became a movement
called No Pago--

00:39:24.190 --> 00:39:25.500
I'm not gonna pay.

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.590
And you had just a grassroots
movement of the so-called

00:39:28.590 --> 00:39:30.720
beneficiaries of microfinance
just turning around and

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:32.840
saying, you guys came in
here 10 years ago.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.430
You told us you were gonna
get us out of poverty.

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.380
The fact of the matter
is, none of us

00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.730
have got out of poverty.

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:40.550
We were meant to be protected
by the government with laws

00:39:40.550 --> 00:39:43.050
about the maximum interest
rates being 20%, 25%.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.810
You're charging us 60%,
70%, 80% interest.

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:49.470
No one's actually benefiting
from this.

00:39:49.470 --> 00:39:51.010
And we're not gonna
pay you anymore.

00:39:51.010 --> 00:39:52.700
And the entire thing
collapsed.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.980
And the microfinance community
was like, hmm, this is a bit

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.700
embarrassing, because it was
caused by our own people, the

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:02.140
people that we've been slapping
up on websites all

00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.180
these years with sewing
machines, saying that these

00:40:04.180 --> 00:40:07.110
people are just so eternally
grateful to us for us being so

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.900
generous as to give them a loan
at 60% interest a year.

00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:12.010
They've now bitten us.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:15.950
That's what happens when
you lend to both

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:16.625
sides of the market.

00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:19.110
It's just a false market.

00:40:21.732 --> 00:40:24.570
AUDIENCE: Can you say something
about microsavings

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.760
as opposed to microcredit?

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.440
HUGH SINCLAIR: Yeah,
microsavings is like the

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.390
forgotten side of the
entire equation.

00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:35.490
And I mean, I'm a big supporter
of microsavings,

00:40:35.490 --> 00:40:39.800
because the great thing is, the
poor, it's not that they

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.860
just don't have access
to credit.

00:40:41.860 --> 00:40:45.070
It's also that they just have
no safe way where they can

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:47.950
deposit their money and maybe
earn a small interest rate,

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:48.950
just to cover inflation.

00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:51.050
That's all that's necessary.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.240
So there are institutions which
focus exclusively in

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.800
microsavings, which is good.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.630
And there are also institutions
which are

00:40:58.630 --> 00:40:59.630
microfinance banks.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.760
So they do the lending.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.770
And they also have savings.

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.080
It's more difficult with savings
for two reasons.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.290
One is that you need
to be regulated.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:11.480
Even in these developing
countries, there are much

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:14.390
stricter rules about taking
money from the general public

00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:16.940
than giving money to the general
public, which is good.

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:18.430
It should be like that.

00:41:18.430 --> 00:41:21.090
So a lot of institutions are
kind of hesitant to get into

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:22.870
savings, because it's
really difficult.

00:41:22.870 --> 00:41:24.530
You have to be regulated.

00:41:24.530 --> 00:41:26.570
People are going to start asking
awkward questions.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.760
And you're gonna have to submit
data to a central bank,

00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.510
which is going to mean that
you can't do certain

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:32.700
activities.

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:36.100
In a way, it's much easier to
operate as an unregulated NGO

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.580
just doing credit.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:39.790
The other problem with savings
is that they're not profitable

00:41:39.790 --> 00:41:42.200
for investors.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.460
No one can actually make any
money out of an institution

00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:49.330
that is just taking money from
the poor and safekeeping it.

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:52.380
So there's a kind of incentive
to not get into it.

00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.620
Now there are people doing it.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.870
An I applaud it.

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:56.090
I think it's the way ahead.

00:41:56.090 --> 00:41:58.560
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I guess from
the perspective of, if you

00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.170
wanted to help the poor,
then it sounds like

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:01.710
microsavings is better.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:04.750
And if you're willing to do,
like, matching funds or

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:07.070
something like that, it
seems like that--

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:09.750
if you're OK with losing money,
essentially, if you

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.770
were going to generate the
money anyways, then

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:14.260
microsavings seems like
a better option.

00:42:14.260 --> 00:42:15.690
HUGH SINCLAIR: Yeah.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.195
Yeah, definitely.

00:42:18.195 --> 00:42:20.100
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
about this data on the

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:22.760
website, Microfinance
Transparency.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.990
How is a process starting
to collect this data?

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:26.990
I assume that at some point,
you have to start recording

00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.940
phone calls and so on.

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:29.930
So when did that get started?

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:31.440
When did you start thinking
about it?

00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.010
HUGH SINCLAIR: Yeah, I sort
of describe it in

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:35.260
the book to an extent.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.110
I saw a couple of pretty
nasty frauds.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:42.960
And then when I tried to
actually do something about

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:45.330
it, I realized, you know what,
damn, I don't actually have

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.840
the data, the proof.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:50.280
And now that I've raised the
alarm bell, now it's too late

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.160
for me to go in and try
and get the data.

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.270
So what I did, when I was
working at this investment

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:57.360
fund in Europe, when I started
realizing, uh-oh, hang on,

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.450
there's some nasty stuff going
on, I learned from the

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.130
previous mistakes.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.470
And I basically just kept
quiet and just started

00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:07.810
secretly gathering all the data
over, yeah, it was about

00:43:07.810 --> 00:43:09.660
a year, I guess.

00:43:09.660 --> 00:43:14.650
And then when I confronted
the management of this

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:18.240
institution, I was fired, went
to court, won a court case

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.310
against them.

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:21.120
And then I was working
as a consultant.

00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.990
But to an extent, that
was still kept

00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:25.230
relatively hushed up.

00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:27.510
People didn't put two
and two together.

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.290
So I was still able to work
with a number of these

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:33.362
institutions, bizarrely, because
the communication in

00:43:33.362 --> 00:43:36.760
the sector was pretty poor
at the best of times.

00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.840
So I was able to lure them
into conversations.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.070
And we were able to do things
like, for example, we would

00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:48.580
make an investment in one of
these funds in the EU.

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:51.030
So we were protected by
a European regulator.

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.380
Do an investment simply
to then be

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.540
protected by the regulator.

00:43:54.540 --> 00:43:55.040
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.260
investment bank, issue a
formal complaint to the

00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:01.240
regulator, and then
go to the AGM.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.060
This was another good trick.

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:03.600
Do an investment.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:03.820
It doesn't matter.

00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:05.910
Even if you've just go $1
invested in the company, the

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.666
company, by law, has to
invite you to the AGM.

00:44:07.666 --> 00:44:09.295
You have the right
to go to the AGM.

00:44:09.295 --> 00:44:10.420
So then you can go to the AGM.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:12.620
And you can stand up and
you can ask a really

00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.420
embarrassing question.

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:16.830
So it was all planned.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.130
It was just a long strategy of,
OK, let's for this one,

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:21.382
then this one, then this
one, then this one.

00:44:21.382 --> 00:44:22.250
And there was a group
of people.

00:44:22.250 --> 00:44:23.380
I mean, I didn't
work on my own.

00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.978
I had a lot of support.

00:44:25.978 --> 00:44:26.560
AUDIENCE: What was it?

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.250
How long did it take?

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:30.410
How long did this
process take?

00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:33.980
HUGH SINCLAIR: Well, I mean, it
wasn't like, OK, now I've

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.270
finished gathering
the data, now we

00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:36.440
start blowing the whistle.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.290
But I mean, really, it started
in about 2007.

00:44:39.290 --> 00:44:42.020
And I guess the book doesn't
really go beyond 2011.

00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.630
So it was about four years.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:47.350
But I was individually blowing
the whistle in certain ways

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:48.600
during that period.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:52.480
But only now I can't get
any phone calls.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.896
Now I can't get any more data.

00:44:53.896 --> 00:44:55.146
Now it's over.

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:03.740
AUDIENCE: I wanted to ask, how
are the mechanisms enforced?

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:07.590
How do they enforce repayment
of loans?

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.350
And another question is,
how do you actually

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:10.470
estimate risk in this?

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.100
I mean, typically when you make
an investment, you're

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.110
balancing risk versus reward.

00:45:15.110 --> 00:45:18.810
And I think the 2008 fiasco
showed us that nobody was able

00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:20.290
to estimate risk.

00:45:20.290 --> 00:45:23.070
And in this particular case, it
seems even more difficult

00:45:23.070 --> 00:45:24.000
to estimate risk.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.742
So what kind of work is
being done on that?

00:45:25.742 --> 00:45:27.700
HUGH SINCLAIR: Yeah.

00:45:27.700 --> 00:45:31.910
The enforcement of loans, yeah,
there's 1,000 different

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:32.800
ways that people do it.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.280
The famous one is the group
lending, so group liability.

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.730
So if one person defaults, the
other people in the group have

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:41.280
to step up to the plate.

00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:44.750
You also have forced savings,
which is pretty unethical.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.210
But a lot of institutions do
it, where in order to get a

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.240
loan, you're forced
to make a deposit.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.440
So effectively, you're
collateralizing your own loan.

00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:55.260
Then also, just in the
contracts, they'll just have

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.490
clauses which say, we can come
and take away your pots and

00:45:57.490 --> 00:45:59.120
pans and your whatever.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:02.010
In the case of India, what you
had in terms of getting loans

00:46:02.010 --> 00:46:06.160
repaid was such aggressive and
threatening practices that,

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.730
actually, in the 54
suicide cases--

00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:13.050
actually it was 53 suicides
and one murder--

00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.600
you just had women who they just
were in total despair.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.400
The loan officers would hound
them, hound them, humiliate

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.940
them, sit outside their houses
and embarrass them in front of

00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:26.100
their neighbors, and just keep
on, just keep driving them

00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.010
down, driving them down, driving
them down, until

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:30.810
eventually, once they've given
up all their assets and

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:33.050
they've got nothing left,
eventually they just killed

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:34.210
themselves.

00:46:34.210 --> 00:46:37.180
With regards to risk, I mean,
there's all sorts of different

00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:38.380
levels that you have
to look at.

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:41.140
I mean, are you talking about
the risk for an investor?

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:47.100
Also has additional risks,
in addition to just

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.780
non-repayment of loans--

00:46:48.780 --> 00:46:50.740
you have things like foreign
exchange risk.

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.920
You have capital controls.

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:53.500
Maybe you invest in a country.

00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.030
Say, for example, you had
invested in Argentina.

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:57.960
Now what you're seeing is it's
getting very difficult to get

00:46:57.960 --> 00:46:59.190
money in and out of Argentina.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.790
So you've got the additional
risks from an investor's

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:02.525
perspective.

00:47:02.525 --> 00:47:05.740
But on the ground level, one
thing that is true is when

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:10.430
people talk about the credit
risk of the poor.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:11.520
It's actually really good.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:16.400
I mean, the statistics of the
98% repayment rates are true.

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:16.900
They are true.

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:20.390
I mean, it tends to
be quite extreme.

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:24.600
It's either 97%, 98%, 99%
repayment rates, very, very

00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.590
good repayment rates.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.050
Or it's a meltdown.

00:47:27.050 --> 00:47:28.660
There's not a lot really
in between.

00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:32.370
So when you get to Nicaragua,
suddenly you get

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.000
30% repayment rates.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.970
But in general, the
poor repay.

00:47:36.970 --> 00:47:42.060
In fact, when you look at who's
the better credit risk,

00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:44.490
I haven't seen any data, but
I think it would be rather

00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:49.080
interesting to see, what is
the repayment rate of Mali

00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:51.200
compared to the United
States right now?

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.100
I wouldn't be surprised to see
that there are a number of

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:57.270
developing countries that are
actually less risky than the

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:58.520
US and Europe.

00:48:01.524 --> 00:48:02.605
MALE SPEAKER: Hugh, we
talked about this

00:48:02.605 --> 00:48:03.680
a little bit before.

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.270
A lot of people here are
interested in Kiva, including

00:48:06.270 --> 00:48:07.890
some very wealthy people
that I know.

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:10.070
Could you say a few
words about that?

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:14.270
HUGH SINCLAIR: Yeah, Kiva gets
10 pages in the book.

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.120
I particularly focus on Kiva.

00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:25.780
I can't go into all the detail
here, because it's very subtle

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.150
things that are happening at
Kiva with regards, did the

00:48:30.150 --> 00:48:35.160
money actually go to that
particular person?

00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.640
There are a lot of question
marks about that.

00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.230
There was the issue in the "New
York Times" about Kiva

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:42.950
post-financing transactions.

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:45.980
So when you lend on Kiva, your
money isn't actually going to

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:46.360
that person.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.820
That person has already had
a loan six months ago.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.580
Essentially what you're doing
is you're buying the

00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.270
loan off the bank.

00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.610
You're post-financing it.

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.430
Now obviously you take
the full credit risk.

00:48:57.430 --> 00:49:00.590
And for all you know, the person
is already in default,

00:49:00.590 --> 00:49:03.570
which raises an ethical
question there.

00:49:03.570 --> 00:49:05.960
Maybe I would like to know at
least if the person is already

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.750
defaulting on the loan.

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:09.360
But then the other question
is, what are the interest

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.000
rates that--

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.610
not Kiva.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.550
Kiva doesn't charge interest.

00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:15.900
Kiva gives the money to the
microfinance institutions.

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:20.850
They then take this
interest-free capital that

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.880
they don't take any of the
credit risk, and they go and

00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.440
lend it out to institutions at
rates which some people would

00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.930
consider extortionate.

00:49:29.930 --> 00:49:32.430
Because the microfinance sector
doesn't dare define

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:35.820
extortionate, you can never say
that it is extortionate,

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:37.300
because there's no definition.

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:39.150
The highest one at the
moment is BRAC in

00:49:39.150 --> 00:49:41.680
Sudan, which is 88%.

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:45.320
In Mexico, they tend
to be in the 80s.

00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.740
And if you say to Kiva, just
answer me one question.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.920
You've given me the photo
of the woman.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:52.785
I know she's getting a goat.

00:49:52.785 --> 00:49:54.990
You told me about her children,
her little story,

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:57.860
her hopes and aspirations, and
how much money she wants, and

00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.940
how long, and what's she
gonna do with it.

00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.245
And you can give me all
this information.

00:50:00.245 --> 00:50:03.230
It can come from the other side
of Mongolia all the way

00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:05.320
to my little computer
in California.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.110
But there's no interest rate.

00:50:07.110 --> 00:50:08.920
Could you tell me what
the interest rate is?

00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:10.190
They can't tell you.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:12.800
They can't or they
won't tell you.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:15.590
I believe it's that actually
they can't.

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:17.600
So they'll fob you off with a
thing called the portfolio

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.160
yield, which is the interest
rate that the institution, on

00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:27.010
average, charges last year
or the year before.

00:50:27.010 --> 00:50:29.650
And they get that data from a
place called the MIX Market,

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:33.430
which is self-submitted data.

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:35.130
So the bank gives the data.

00:50:35.130 --> 00:50:37.500
A couple of years later, it gets
into the Kiva website.

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.480
And Kiva say, that's a kind of
rough proxy of the actual

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:42.550
interest rate.

00:50:42.550 --> 00:50:44.180
That's as close as
they get to it.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.340
Now the problem is is that
portfolio yield is one of the

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:50.650
easiest statistics to
manipulate, legally manipulate

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.600
under the accounting laws of
most countries, because of the

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.760
subtleties of how it's
actually calculated.

00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:59.090
And I have personally
manipulated portfolio yields,

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:00.210
I'm ashamed to say.

00:51:00.210 --> 00:51:02.050
It's a really easy
one to go for.

00:51:02.050 --> 00:51:04.370
It's also the one statistic
that all the microfinance

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.970
institutions are very
sensitive about.

00:51:06.970 --> 00:51:09.450
They want to get that down as
low as possible, because they

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.940
know that people raise an
eyebrow when you see portfolio

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:13.865
yields of 125%.

00:51:13.865 --> 00:51:17.280
It's such an emotive topic that
they just do everything

00:51:17.280 --> 00:51:19.020
they can to reduce it.

00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:20.650
And it's very easy
to reduce it.

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:24.950
So if you just ask one question
to Kiva, for me,

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:28.060
that's the question to ask, is
why won't you tell me the

00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:31.075
interest rate of the loan that
I made to that person?

00:51:31.075 --> 00:51:34.990
But the fundamental question
about Kiva for me is-- and in

00:51:34.990 --> 00:51:37.280
the book, I go through
all the 990 reports.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:40.180
And you can see the buffer
accounting Kiva, which is, I

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:43.000
think, currently it's about
$40 million sitting in an

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.610
account in California, in
Wells Fargo, California.

00:51:47.610 --> 00:51:50.310
And who earns interest
on that money?

00:51:50.310 --> 00:51:53.560
Remember when you clicked I
Accept on the user acceptance

00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:57.460
thing, and you forgot to read
paragraph 89 of page 412,

00:51:57.460 --> 00:52:00.150
subsection E9?

00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:02.980
All the interest earned in the
buffer account accumulates to

00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.470
Kiva, of course.

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:09.450
Now is $42 million a large
buffer account to have for a

00:52:09.450 --> 00:52:12.540
company that's actually doing
about $60 million to $70

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:14.082
million a year?

00:52:14.082 --> 00:52:14.860
I don't know.

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:16.690
I think it sounds like quite
a big buffer to me.

00:52:16.690 --> 00:52:18.680
But I don't pass any judgment.

00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:21.950
I just say I could do it
on a smaller buffer.

00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:22.650
But the question is this.

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:24.040
Who is Kiva for?

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.680
Who are the beneficiaries
of Kiva?

00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:30.590
This is my question
to them, is Kiva

00:52:30.590 --> 00:52:31.925
trying to help the poor?

00:52:31.925 --> 00:52:35.400
Or is Kiva trying to give a
nice feeling to people in

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.200
America, to feel like
I've done something?

00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.240
It's like the child
sponsorship.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.250
It's like, here I am
in California.

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:45.130
There's all this suffering in
the world, I believe in free

00:52:45.130 --> 00:52:47.040
markets and entrepreneurship
and everything.

00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:47.880
But what am I gonna do?

00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.700
I can't do anything.

00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:52.650
So huh, I can just do $25
on my Paypal account.

00:52:52.650 --> 00:52:55.220
And I can get this nice fluffy
feeling inside that I helped

00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.910
this woman buy a goat
or a sewing machine.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:58.940
I've got a photo to prove it.

00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:00.810
And then I just feel better
about myself.

00:53:00.810 --> 00:53:02.970
So my question is, who is
the beneficiary of Kiva?

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:04.090
I don't think it's
the poor at all.

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:05.340
I think it's you guys.

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:12.660
AUDIENCE: There was big news in
the last year that Facebook

00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:15.295
had an IPO and raised a
tremendous amount of capital,

00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:18.730
presumably, to fund future
development of their business.

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:21.730
I recently heard from two
googlers about that principle

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:26.100
being applied at a smaller
scale, where very small

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:31.080
startups can raise on the order
of $100,000 or $250,000,

00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:35.040
which sort of resembles the
difference in microfinance

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:37.570
that we would typically
refer to.

00:53:37.570 --> 00:53:40.820
But there's also the scale of,
say, someone who wants to open

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.200
a pizza shop in the US.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:46.320
And they want to raise
$20,000 in order to

00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:47.530
get started on that.

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.150
So I'm wondering, what is the
difference between raising

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:53.040
capital at the very large
level versus this

00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.130
microfinance level?

00:53:56.130 --> 00:53:58.640
How should we think about the
difference in these to

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:03.160
accomplish a social good of
prosperity for a group of

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.410
individuals?

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:10.300
HUGH SINCLAIR: Well, first of
all, I would say that this

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:15.120
label, "microfinance," is
actually ridiculous in a way.

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:17.120
Microfinance is just banking.

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.800
It's nothing more sophisticated
than banking.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:23.590
We're just doing it in bigger
volumes to poorer people at

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:25.160
higher interest rates.

00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:29.170
So I don't think that you can
say, here's the formal banking

00:54:29.170 --> 00:54:31.260
sector of developed countries,
and now we've

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:32.760
got this new thing.

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.770
It's not new at all.

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:37.390
The difference what you're
referring to is

00:54:37.390 --> 00:54:40.240
this debt and equity.

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.110
Those are two very

00:54:41.110 --> 00:54:42.340
fundamentally different things.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.980
Now when you start raising
equity, it has a whole

00:54:45.980 --> 00:54:49.000
different risk-reward profile.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.550
So I think that saying that
microfinance could be used for

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:54.970
equity, maybe here that
could happen.

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:57.455
But the idea of having
shareholder agreements and all

00:54:57.455 --> 00:55:00.170
this sort of stuff in the
developing world is, in

00:55:00.170 --> 00:55:04.173
practice, probably not going
to happen for 100 years.

00:55:04.173 --> 00:55:07.490
But I don't know, sorry.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:08.820
I mean, does that answer
your question?

00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:10.065
I'm not sure if I--

00:55:10.065 --> 00:55:10.540
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.090
MALE SPEAKER: I think
I need to interrupt.

00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:12.990
AUDIENCE: Basically,
it's banking.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:13.980
HUGH SINCLAIR: Yeah,
it's banking.

00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:16.130
This is just banking, good-old
fashioned banking.

00:55:16.130 --> 00:55:18.110
We've been doing it
for 1,000 years.

00:55:18.110 --> 00:55:19.410
Now we're just doing
it to the poor.

00:55:22.970 --> 00:55:26.070
There shouldn't be this aura
about microfinance.

00:55:26.070 --> 00:55:29.200
And actually, when you get the
mainstream banks doing a thing

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:33.030
called downscaling and moving
into the microfinance area, in

00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:35.270
a way that might be one of the
most sensible ways to do it.

00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:37.640
Instead of setting up dedicated
microfinance

00:55:37.640 --> 00:55:39.560
institutions, actually just
saying, let's just get the

00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:41.010
banks to go deeper
into the market.

00:55:41.010 --> 00:55:42.460
And that is happening already.

00:55:42.460 --> 00:55:44.000
MALE SPEAKER: Let's thank
Hugh for coming here.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.900
HUGH SINCLAIR: Thank
you very much.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.922
