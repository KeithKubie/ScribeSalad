00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.200
In a previous video, I made a fire piston out of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.070
some scrap acrylic and a lawnmower handle.&nbsp; This 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.170
little tool can be used to start a fire by squishing 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.010
air, and since it's completely see through, you can 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.180
witness the ignition first hand!

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.240
Whether you use it as a tool for making a survival 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.070
fire, or to explore the science of heating through 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.240
adiabatic compression, it's always gratifying to get 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.180
a spark and make a flame.&nbsp; I called it a "Slam Rod 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.010
Fire Starter" which apparently has been added into 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.000
Wikipedia!&nbsp; That kind of blows my mind.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.220
I've had a lot of requests from people who would 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.280
like to have one, but don't know where they can find 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.100
any acrylic to make it.&nbsp; So in appreciation of 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.080
10,000 subscribers, I'm going to give this one away!

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.230
Over 10,000 of you have shown your support by 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.070
subscribing, sharing my videos, and leaving really 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:49.060
great comments!&nbsp;

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.050
For a chance to win, all you have to do is follow 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.150
these three simple steps;

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.180
First of all, you need to be a Subscriber to my 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.230
YouTube channel.&nbsp; There are many ways to subscribe, 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.140
but if you're having trouble, check for a link in 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.100
the description.&nbsp; Many of you are already 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.130
subscribers, and that really means a lot to me, so 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.000
thank you!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.070
Next, check out the video on how I made this fire 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.110
piston by clicking the link in the description, 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.200
And this last part is important.&nbsp; Leave a comment 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.220
telling me what size drill bit I used to make the 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.280
hole for my tinder claw.&nbsp; The answer is in the 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.040
video.  I'll be picking a winner by taking the total 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.200
number of comments on this contest page, and using 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.110
an online random number generator to pick a number.&nbsp; 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.140
There's no limit to how many comments you can leave 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.200
so feel free to increase your chances of winning by 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.220
leaving more than one. &nbsp;

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.130
The winner will be notified, and posted in the 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.230
description of this video on October 15th.

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.270
Thanks for watching, thanks for your support, and 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.090
best of luck!
