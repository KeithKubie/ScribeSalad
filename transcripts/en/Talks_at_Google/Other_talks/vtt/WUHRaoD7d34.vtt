ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, good morning
or good afternoon, or

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.660
good evening, depending on
where you are in Google.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.270
This is a familiar venue
for me, and I hope for

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.090
all of you as well.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.910
We occasionally get to visit
with people who are probably

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.030
more consequential than anybody
else in the world or

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.500
pretty close.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.700
And in my career, I've had an
opportunity to visit and know

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.670
one or two or three or
four of such people--

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.000
Vint Cerf, for example, who
invented the internet.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.310
It may very well be that Salman
Khan becomes the most

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.740
important educator in
the entire world.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.940
We will see.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.690
ERIC SCHMIDT: But to imagine
the potential that this

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.290
gentleman has, in terms of
changing the world ahead of

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.580
us, literally gives me
goosebumps, to think of the

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.890
impact that his invention and
his approach can have for

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.200
billions of people.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.650
It is an honor and a privilege
to have you here at Google.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.120
SALMAN KHAN: Well, it's
great to be here.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.530
And I like the low
expectations that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.360
you've set for me.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.550
ERIC SCHMIDT: So I think this
audience pretty much knows

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.330
Sal's story.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.620
But for those who may not know,
this is a gentleman who

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.170
should have done
something else.

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.770
Brilliant mathematician,
physics,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.940
everything you could imagine.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.430
On his way to the most lucrative
possible job,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.395
running hedge funds
here in New York.

00:01:33.395 --> 00:01:35.480
SALMAN KHAN: I think second
most lucrative after--

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.730
well, anyway.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:45.350
ERIC SCHMIDT: And somehow, right
at that point, he made a

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.210
decision that changed his life,
his family's life, and I

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.690
think, literally everyone
else's.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.270
You want to talk about how you
got into the video YouTube

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.620
business big time?

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.160
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah so a lot
of you all might know the

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.630
initial, genesis story.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.450
I was working with my
cousins remotely.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.860
Initially, I was in Boston.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.100
Then, the firm that I was
working for, it was me, my

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.610
boss, who was our portfolio
manager, and his dog.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.730
The dog was the chief
economist.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.830
His wife became a professor
at Stanford Law.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.880
So then, we moved out
to Silicon Valley.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.480
And then, while I was tutoring
all of my cousins remotely,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.260
and I started working on the
interactive part, which is the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.010
questions and the quizzing and
keeping track of students.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.270
And I didn't think about the
video it all, at that point.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.280
This was Fall of 2006.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.870
I was showing this to a friend
in Silicon Valley.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.590
You know, the software part
I was showing him.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.740
And he said, oh,
this is great.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.810
I said, but my problem is I'm
having trouble keeping up with

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.030
all these cousins.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.990
And he's the one that
recommended, well, there's

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:53.200
this thing called YouTube.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.680
And I was like, yeah.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.580
I've kind of heard of it.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.110
And why don't you make some
tutorials and put it on that.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.620
I was like, no, no.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.070
YouTube is for cats
playing piano.

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.660
It's not for math.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.620
But I got over the idea that
it wasn't my idea.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.240
And I gave it a shot.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.510
And I think a lot of stories
that you all are familiar with

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.050
on YouTube--

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.600
I'm not quite at Justin
Bieber scale yet--

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.710
but a lot of people started
watching it.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.780
I had set it up as a
not-for-profit in 2008.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.630
And in 2009, as you described,
it was already

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:29.490
taking over my life.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.070
At that point, there was no way
I could do anything else.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: So this is really
all about YouTube.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.720
SALMAN KHAN: It is.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.452
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:37.670
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah,
I don't think--

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.895
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think,
frankly, you

00:03:39.895 --> 00:03:40.540
should just thank YouTube.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.030
SALMAN KHAN: I should.

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.280
I should just thank YouTube.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.150
That's right.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.290
ERIC SCHMIDT: So content--

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.580
if it had not existed, you
would be like nothing.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.200
SALMAN KHAN: I would just
be one of those--

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:52.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: You would
be making lots of

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:53.660
money in hedge funds.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.815
SALMAN KHAN: Yes, exactly,
exactly.

00:03:55.815 --> 00:03:58.090
ERIC SCHMIDT: So what happened
was, we had this wonderful

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.630
scenario where YouTube
created a platform.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.590
And then, you decided to
start working on math.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.400
How did this idea go from the
first, with your cousin?

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.380
And how did it go to being all
of high school, all of

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.870
everything?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.550
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, it's
interesting question.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.950
When I started this--

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.410
Fall of 2006, early 2007--

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.050
like everyone else, Wikipedia
was already out there.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.890
And you're like, anything
substantive is

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.650
going to be the crowd.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.590
Or it's definitely going
to be multiple people.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.560
When you just think about
a K through 12 review.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.160
Khan is actually more
K through 14, or

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.090
even goes into college.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.120
But it seems like this huge
amount of content.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.030
If you look at the textbooks,
each of these courses are like

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:38.960
these 1,000 page textbooks.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.030
And so I immediately started.

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.300
Well, I'm just going to do these
as a proof of concept.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.060
And I will then get my friends
or people I know, to

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.960
kind of join in.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.890
We can do this together.

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.660
Then, maybe collectively,
20 of us might be

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.460
able to tackle Algebra.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.430
But once I started
doing it, I made

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.820
about 80 videos initially.

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.365
I was like, it's not
100% comprehensive.

00:04:57.365 --> 00:05:01.470
But if someone watches those and
understands those, that's

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.220
a pretty good scaffold
of algebra.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: And it's important
to-- those of you

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.470
who are not studying high school
algebra at the moment.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.820
But these are in fact
very simple videos.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.110
They're shot with just
a little white board.

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:13.710
SALMAN KHAN: When I
started doing it.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.990
I said, well, these are
for my cousins.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.000
I don't feel like buying
a video camera.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.330
And I didn't feel like buying
anything fancy.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.670
So I literally used a USB
headset and Microsoft paint.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:26.600
I didn't even look to see
if there was something.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.630
ERIC SCHMIDT: We have
better products.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.660
SALMAN KHAN: I've
learned that.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.460
I've learned that.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.170
I now use another
free program.

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: Everything
at Google is free.

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.890
Trust me.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:35.690
SALMAN KHAN: Oh, yes.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.720
That is pressure--

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.150
But anyway, I started
making them.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.670
And they were really just you
saw my little scrawls.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.280
And the first few ones, I
actually cringe when I look at

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:47.090
the older ones.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.560
But some people said, oh,
I really like that.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.840
It felt very homespun
type of thing.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.760
But yeah, they're kind of
the shaky handwriting.

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.200
And you hear my voice-over.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.840
But it became clear.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.920
A lot of people think content
goes stale fast.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.600
And it's true.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.770
If you're writing a blog, if
you're doing a news site,

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.010
every day you've got to have--

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:05.700
and people say, content
doesn't scale.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.340
But with was stuff like algebra,
those 80 videos, it

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.130
took me like a month
to do them.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.670
That's kind of algebra.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:15.010
And then, I kept going.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:17.820
And it eventually became like
this Forrest Gump type--

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.660
can I race across America
type of adventure.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.690
And I said well, I'm going
to do all of mathematics.

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:28.750
ERIC SCHMIDT: And so we're
clear, he didn't stop when he

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.406
did all of mathematics.

00:06:31.406 --> 00:06:33.070
Yes, what's next after
mathematics?

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.950
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, the physics
was close to my heart.

00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.920
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK, that
was easy for you.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:39.360
What was the next one?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.400
SALMAN KHAN: Then, I was an
analyst at a hedge fund.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.240
And it was funny because
everyone--

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.040
ERIC SCHMIDT: So how about--

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.180
you did this "Origins of the
Financial Disaster" video?

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:48.780
SALMAN KHAN: Yes.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.720
And people should look at--

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.820
ERIC SCHMIDT: Who was the
target for that one?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.260
SALMAN KHAN: It was for people
I meet at cocktail parties.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:58.840
Because people say, you're an
analyst at a hedge fund.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:02.800
And I was actually like a huge
housing bear in like 2005,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.860
2006, 2007.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.800
And everybody says, how
come you haven't

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.650
bought a house yet?

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.640
They could only go up.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.800
And you could--

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.240
and I would say, let me
explain it to you.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.766
Actually, that used to be my
interview questions, when I

00:07:14.766 --> 00:07:16.100
used to interview someone
at a hedge fund.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.860
I would say, should
I rent or buy?

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.245
And they would say,
you should buy.

00:07:20.245 --> 00:07:21.860
I was like, I haven't even
told you the price yet.

00:07:24.505 --> 00:07:27.700
And they were like, OK.

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.240
And you just keep going.

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.490
And they're like, the
rent is this.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:30.940
This is that.

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.860
This is the house.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:32.790
It's a $1 million.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.870
Should I rent or buy?

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.760
Oh, you should buy that.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.010
OK.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.490
Now the house is $2 million.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:37.780
The rent hasn't changed.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:38.650
Should you rent or buy?

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:41.510
And so I felt that needed some
explanation to the world that

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:46.710
there is a way of thinking about
this type of a problem.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.020
And then, I did a whole
thing about the--

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.170
ERIC SCHMIDT: My guess is none
of the hedge fund managers

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:52.520
have actually watched your
seven minute video.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.580
They're too embarrassed to learn
from YouTube and you.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:58.100
SALMAN KHAN: Some of them have
actually been more forthright.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.340
During the financial crisis, I
did get a letter-- and I won't

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.750
say which bank--

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.730
from someone who said, thank
you for the video on

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.110
mortgage-backed securities.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:08.000
I now know what I
do for a living.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.022
Which I thought, better
late than never.

00:08:13.022 --> 00:08:15.890
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the way, it's
important to know that Sal has

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.050
just organized a computer
science program.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:21.460
So those of you who are computer
scientists, you have

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:22.590
an opportunity to learn about
computer science.

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.590
SALMAN KHAN: I don't think.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:27.410
Yes, I think the folks here
will-- well anyway.

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.970
ERIC SCHMIDT: There's a very
interesting story that is the

00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:31.960
transition from you.

00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:36.000
At some point, you ran out
of USB camera time.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.200
And the time sitting
in your apartment.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.650
And you wanted to found--

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:43.500
And Khan Academy is a
non-profit, by the way.

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.810
So tell us.

00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:47.440
How did you go to being a
significant organization?

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.190
How did you get funded?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:49.730
How did you get your
board set?

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.340
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.550
So there was one foundation that
in 2008 was saying, oh,

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:56.570
are you a not-for-profit.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.360
I'm like, what's a
not-for-profit.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.240
That's my intention.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.330
And they told me.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.540
No, it's a thing.

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.050
You'd have to file it-- become
a corporation then

00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:06.440
file with the IRS.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.490
And I said, I'm going
to do it.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:10.560
And originally, I called
up some law firm.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:13.700
And they said it was
$20,000 to do that.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.480
Then I found some people in
Tennessee who did it over the

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.620
internet for $2,000.

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.710
They're actually very good.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:24.500
Actually, I'll be a referral
for them at any point.

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.390
So they set it up.

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.940
That foundation didn't end up
supporting Khan Academy.

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.580
Then, in 2009, when I'd quit
my job, I started to think

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:32.980
about it more seriously.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.140
ERIC SCHMIDT: Because
you didn't have

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:34.620
money for the rent.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.520
SALMAN KHAN: Because
I didn't have.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.070
ERIC SCHMIDT: You had failed
to purchase a house.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.310
SALMAN KHAN: Yes, I didn't
have a house.

00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:42.720
And not having money makes you
take things seriously.

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.910
And I started pitching to a
bunch of foundations and

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:45.950
philanthropists.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:53.700
And it was in May of 2010 that,
famously, Ann Doerr sent

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.510
that $10,000 check.

00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:58.270
And I immediately emailed her
back saying, if we were

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.370
physical school, you
would now have a

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.470
building named after you.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.890
That was the largest donation
ever gotten.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:04.690
The rest before that,
it was like $50

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:06.300
was the biggest donation.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.490
And then, we famously met
in downtown Palo Alto.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.980
And she said, well, what's
your vision?

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:14.540
I said, it's a free world-class
education for

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.450
anyone anywhere.

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.050
And she said, that's
a modest ambition.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.730
And what does it envision?

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.180
And actually, around the same
time, I had some initial talks

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.220
with Google as well.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.550
And this is what I was
telling everyone.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.915
I was like, I want to keep
making these videos.

00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.790
We can translate them into the
languages of the world.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:35.275
We can create an interactive
platform.

00:10:35.275 --> 00:10:38.510
We can have a community
of learners.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.260
And she said, well, that's
interesting.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:41.350
And how are you supporting
yourself?

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.650
And I said, I'm not.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.550
And then, when I went home,
she wrote that first--

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:48.930
she sent a wire over text.

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:50.190
You should be supporting
yourself.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.230
I've just wired you $100,000.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:55.870
So it was a good day.

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:58.690
And then, it was really
later that summer

00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.900
that it all came to--

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:01.930
I was talking to Google
this entire time.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:03.320
And I didn't realize it
was all about this

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.780
10 to the 100 Project.

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.350
And it was really at the end of
that summer that the Google

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:12.370
folks said, what would you
do with $2 million?

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:15.246
And I said, is this
an open question?

00:11:15.246 --> 00:11:16.570
Because I could buy some pets.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.120
ERIC SCHMIDT: I was like that
interview question.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.230
SALMAN KHAN: But it was
really the same

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:22.760
pitch that I told Ann.

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.800
So by that fall, they were
really the first.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.120
At that point, it
was the largest

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.230
donation is the $2 million.

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:32.220
ERIC SCHMIDT: And Bill Gates
Foundation was also a

00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:32.450
significant--

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:34.310
SALMAN KHAN: Yes, right out
the gate, in that fall of

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.090
2010, it was Google $2 million,
Gates Foundation,

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.950
same order of magnitude.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.320
You know, get our first
office space.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.610
At the time, it was to hire a
team of five people and start

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.710
translating into the different
languages and

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.840
build a software platform.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.726
So thank you.

00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:54.740
ERIC SCHMIDT: And I want
to credit Ann Doerr.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:57.820
Ann, who I've known for many,
many years, is John Doerr's

00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.320
wife-- he's on our board--

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:04.260
saw this and immediately
understood the scale of what

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.630
this could be.

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:08.650
And I've told her, I think this
may be the single most

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.910
important professional thing
she ever does, at the scale

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:12.920
that you're now operating.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.930
And she's been fantastic
as a supporter.

00:12:14.930 --> 00:12:17.200
And I've recently joined the
board, in the spirit of full

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.450
disclosure.

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.550
And obviously, I'm
a supporter.

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:28.930
The interesting thing is that
there was a point at which you

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:31.790
went from hey, I'm making really
interesting videos.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:35.830
What happened in the US was
that moms and dads, mostly

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:40.930
moms, who had preteen kids
started watching these videos.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.400
And it was completely
word of mouth.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:44.720
And so you'd hear this.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.520
And you'd hear it
in your corner.

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.840
Who's Khan Academy?

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.980
There's a different Khan.

00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:51.710
That's like a politician.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:53.780
SALMAN KHAN: There's
a Bollywood actor.

00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:56.105
He's somewhat well known.

00:12:56.105 --> 00:12:57.910
ERIC SCHMIDT: OK.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.660
So it's one of those
underground

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.250
kind of viral things.

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.200
And it worked.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.000
And that was where, I
think, the word of

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.860
mouth really started.

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:08.610
And then with the Google
grant, you got this

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.230
opportunity to the international
thing.

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:12.160
But then something interesting
happened.

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:16.180
Somehow, you decided to change
the way education works or at

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.680
least run the experiment.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.380
And you showed up
in Los Altos.

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.500
This is where you live,
in Los Altos.

00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:26.610
And you sort of say, hey, I
want to change the school

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:27.980
system in my little district.

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.010
SALMAN KHAN: I live
in Mountain View.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.620
But obviously, I live literally
100 meters away.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:34.160
So they're the adjacent
school district.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:36.290
And when we got the first
grants from the Gates

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:39.650
Foundation and Google, we
still viewed this--

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:42.810
none of that initial pitch
was about thinking about

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.050
transforming physical schools
or thinking about what

00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:47.980
education could become or what
happens with higher education.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:48.780
We were just like, no.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.870
Through virtual means, we're
going to do the best we can to

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:53.530
see how we can deliver knowledge
and interactivity

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:54.520
and whatever else.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.370
But right when we did that, Los
Altos came to us and said,

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.350
we heard some stuff about
what you're doing.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.880
Maybe it could be used
in a physical school.

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.900
So what would you do?

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: Was it really your
idea or really sort of a

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:06.425
joint idea?

00:14:06.425 --> 00:14:08.080
Or is it some superintendent
who was clever?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.850
SALMAN KHAN: Actually, it was
Mark Goines, who's a fairly

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:15.100
prominent angel investor in
the valley, who was on the

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.950
board of Los Altos.

00:14:16.950 --> 00:14:20.100
And we were introduced by I
think some at the Gates--

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:22.260
he's an interesting guy to
talk to, a good adviser.

00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:24.250
He's a great guy.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.420
We met at that Pete's
Coffee on Castro.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.660
And at the end of it, he's
like, I'm on the

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.680
board at Los Altos.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.510
I'd love to have you meet the
superintendent and the

00:14:34.510 --> 00:14:36.090
assistant superintendent.

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:39.330
And then when we chatted, they
said, well, what would you do

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.110
with a fifth grade classroom?

00:14:41.110 --> 00:14:45.450
And I said, now that there are
ways to get lecture other than

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.540
a traditional, physical lecture,
now that there are

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:52.170
ways to get interactive problem
solving and give

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:54.120
teachers data, I wouldn't
have classroom

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.370
based on lectures anymore.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.990
And as soon as it's not based
on lecture, then it doesn't

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:02.150
have to be at the same
pace anymore, either.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.380
So we'll have every student
working at their own pace.

00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:08.470
Teachers get information about
it and are able to intervene

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.910
in a very personal way with
students or have the students

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.080
intervene with each other
in a personal way.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.080
And I thought this was a very
theoretical conversation.

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.550
It's let me dream big.

00:15:17.550 --> 00:15:20.050
And they came back, literally
three days later, and said,

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:21.020
this is a great idea.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:21.770
Let's try it.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:22.980
We want to try it in
four classrooms.

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:27.380
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the way,
this never happens.

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:29.330
This is like a meteorite hit.

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:30.285
That's how rate random
this is.

00:15:30.285 --> 00:15:31.580
SALMAN KHAN: No, it was funny.

00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:32.490
Because right when they
said that, I was

00:15:32.490 --> 00:15:33.170
like, oh, that's great.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.510
ERIC SCHMIDT: You must have
done a pretty good job of

00:15:34.510 --> 00:15:34.810
pitching this.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:35.880
SALMAN KHAN: Perhaps.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.370
I don't know.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:39.680
I don't know what they saw.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:40.330
I guess it was good.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.550
ERIC SCHMIDT: Some random
guy walks up and

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:42.800
says, let's redo the--

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.290
I mean, come on.

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:45.390
SALMAN KHAN: We had been
recently validated by some

00:15:45.390 --> 00:15:46.290
well known--

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:46.810
but it's true.

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:47.390
It was funny.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.460
Because right after they told
me that, I was like, by the

00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:51.970
way, can we lease some office
space from you?

00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:54.120
We ended up going to downtown
Mountain View.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.260
But we didn't even know.

00:15:56.260 --> 00:16:00.120
That was, I think our president
now, Shantanu,

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.080
either was about to join or had
just joined from McKinsey,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:03.900
to kind of help out.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:05.570
But we didn't know where
our office space was.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:07.020
We hadn't hired our team yet.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:08.650
But yeah, it was very
early days.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.520
And we were shocked because it's
a public school district.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.890
ERIC SCHMIDT: So Sal came to
Google and actually sort of

00:16:13.890 --> 00:16:14.830
explained his model.

00:16:14.830 --> 00:16:16.530
And a number of us
were part of it.

00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:20.170
And the most interesting thing
that has become the overall

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:22.470
narrative is the inversion
of the classroom.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.150
Can you explain that idea?

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:24.990
And does it really work?

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:27.860
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, so this Los
Altos thing ended up working

00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:29.800
wonderfully, especially
in the early days.

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:32.360
We didn't have the data
in the early days,

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.540
the test score data.

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:36.210
But anecdotally, famously, the
kids didn't want to go to

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:37.040
recess anymore.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.140
It was super interactive.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.870
The teachers were enjoying
themselves.

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:45.430
ERIC SCHMIDT: This also
never happens.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:49.700
SALMAN KHAN: And it
was in that April

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.860
invited to TED to speak.

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.390
And so I was like, look.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.300
We're going to talk about this
interesting thing that's

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:56.430
happening at Los Altos.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:01.060
And during that TEDTalk, kind
of in the run up to talking

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.490
about Los Altos, which was
really taking it a lot further

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:06.404
than the flipped classroom
that I think is

00:17:06.404 --> 00:17:07.950
being alluded to.

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:11.530
I talked about, even in 2007,
2008, I did get emails from

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.010
teachers who were saying--

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:15.430
you've already given a competent
lecture or an

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.660
interesting lecture about
factoring polynomials.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:18.869
Or how does meiosis work?

00:17:18.869 --> 00:17:20.560
Or why does borrowing make
sense, or who knows

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.530
what it might be.

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.339
I don't need to give that
lecture anymore.

00:17:23.339 --> 00:17:25.900
Students can watch it at their
own time, their own pace.

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.550
They get the benefits
that my cousins had.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.390
If you're in algebra class,
and you forgot how to add

00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:32.430
fractions, you will not raise
your hand and say, excuse me,

00:17:32.430 --> 00:17:33.760
I forgot how to--

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.720
now, you can do it without
any shame.

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.235
And then, they could
use class time for

00:17:37.235 --> 00:17:38.160
actual problem solving.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.050
So it used to be homework.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:43.140
Problem solving can now be done
with the context of peers

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:44.840
and your teacher.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.150
You have people to help you.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:48.030
By helping other people,
you'll learn more.

00:17:48.030 --> 00:17:51.780
And that used to be one pace,
very passive lecture could now

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:53.230
be a somewhat more
active lecture.

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:55.030
You could pause if you don't
understand a term, watch

00:17:55.030 --> 00:17:56.860
another video, remediate.

00:17:56.860 --> 00:17:58.580
What we hope now--

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.880
and that's what the TEDTalk,
the next few minutes of it,

00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.640
went into well, that's great.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.680
Now we can take it even further,
with every student

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.935
learning at their own pace.

00:18:07.935 --> 00:18:09.830
ERIC SCHMIDT: What
was interesting

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.710
about the first results--

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:13.450
and I remember this
very clearly.

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:16.290
You gave the example of a little
Johnny or whatever, who

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:20.090
got stuck on a particular kind
of fractions and loses the

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:21.490
rest of the year.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.270
Because that building
block is needed for

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.740
the subsequent work.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:29.300
And so there's evidence that,
in traditional learning, the

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.240
kid gets stuck.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:31.330
And they never catch up.

00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:32.010
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:35.315
ERIC SCHMIDT: Whereas, in your
model, they take a little bit

00:18:35.315 --> 00:18:39.120
of extra time because it's hard
or for whatever reason.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.960
And there is data that indicates
that they ultimately

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.990
do better than the median.

00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.830
That's extraordinary.

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:47.235
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, it's
blown our minds.

00:18:47.235 --> 00:18:48.990
And on some level, it's
been like oh, my God.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.180
This is an amazing thing.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:51.680
But on a whole other dimension,
it's completely

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.360
common sense.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:56.000
You know, I write a lot
of in the book about--

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.760
one example, this past year
we've been working in Oakland.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:00.630
And it's a charter school.

00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:02.000
These kids are signed
up for, essentially,

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.600
a Pre-Algebra class.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.310
They're sixth and
seventh graders.

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:07.420
And then, as soon as they
started working on Khan

00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:08.940
Academy, we were able to look
at the data in real

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.720
time and say, wow.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.520
Some of these kids don't know
their multiplication tables.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.620
Some of these kids don't know
how to add decimals.

00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:16.440
And in traditional model,
they're in an Algebra class.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.020
They're in a Pre-Algebra
class.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.270
You do algebra.

00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:20.380
And the teacher knew
this, too.

00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:22.390
The teacher knew that there
were these core weaknesses

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.100
because these students just
kept being promoted along,

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.990
even though they had these
gaps in their knowledge.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:28.710
And then, at some point, when
they're just not getting

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.430
algebra, it has nothing to
do with the algebra.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:33.640
It's just because they
can't even understand

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.740
what's going on.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:38.620
And so when we kind of did it
the other way around, even in

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.690
this case in Oakland and
earlier, in Los Altos, the

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.260
most interesting data came from
a remedial math class.

00:19:44.260 --> 00:19:46.930
When we let these students work
at their own pace, right

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.070
in the beginning, there were
these group of kids that just

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:49.700
raced ahead.

00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:51.340
And you'd say, oh, those
are the gifted kids.

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.760
They'll go work at
Google one day.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.790
And here are the slower kids.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:57.620
There are other things
that they can do.

00:20:00.185 --> 00:20:02.030
And in a traditional school
system, that's how you do it.

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:03.830
Usually around middle school,
you track them.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:07.680
But what we see is if you let
this group over here work at

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:08.570
their own pace--

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:11.420
a lot of it was remediation,
picking up stuff that they

00:20:11.420 --> 00:20:12.320
really should have learned.

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.490
But in the old system, you
get a C. That's fine.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:16.090
That's passing.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.170
You go to the next thing, even
though you have a gap.

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.210
And they were able to fill in
all those gaps and really get

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:21.420
mastery at them.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.980
That's same kid that you thought
was week six months

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.830
ago is now the best student
in the class.

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:27.340
And we're seeing that,
over and over again.

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:29.920
ERIC SCHMIDT: What I'd like to
do is now is explore a little

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.030
bit about where this goes.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.590
The first question is--

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:39.320
this is an analytical group,
by any measure.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:42.020
What are the provably true
things that we could say

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.990
today, based on the activities
you've done?

00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:49.650
We know that there's a lot of
anecdotal evidence that people

00:20:49.650 --> 00:20:52.900
do better with your videos and
parents around the world are

00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.780
celebrating this.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.330
What sort of science is
behind your success?

00:20:57.330 --> 00:21:03.320
SALMAN KHAN: So the provably
true statements are the ones--

00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:04.830
I could say this.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:06.950
And it's very different
depending on which schools.

00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:09.150
So I don't want to make a
blanket statement that Khan

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.370
Academy will always improve your
test scores by 25% or--

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:19.120
I guess I could say, or your
money back because it's free.

00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.675
But in the ones that
we've studied--

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:26.910
Los Altos, Oakland Unity,
Summit, KIPP--

00:21:26.910 --> 00:21:29.860
is that we've seen fairly
substantial,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.710
not 1% to 2% changes.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.570
But in the case of Oakland, we
saw an order-of-magnitude

00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:37.480
change in the number of students
who were performing

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.070
at a proficient level.

00:21:39.070 --> 00:21:43.370
In the remedial class, in Los
Altos, not just based on our

00:21:43.370 --> 00:21:46.580
own data, I talk about that kid
who was slow and speed up.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.790
On the California test scores,
clearly to be placed in a

00:21:49.790 --> 00:21:52.210
remedial class, they were well
below average, all of them,

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.370
some of them severely
below average.

00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:57.250
But then, after this,
there were a few

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.120
kids that were advanced.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.300
ERIC SCHMIDT: The next question
has to do with the

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.600
educational establishment.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.870
You're the classic example of
the outsider who has the

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.430
benefit of not being aware that
there's been 20 years of

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:10.870
data which says you're wrong.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:16.640
And you've been pretty heavily
criticized by people who, I

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.380
think, are more jealous than
anything else that

00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.120
you've done so well.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.250
That's obviously my bias.

00:22:23.250 --> 00:22:26.880
What's the legitimate response
from the educational

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:28.190
institutions?

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:32.355
Do you ultimately think that
they will embrace this model?

00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:34.760
Do you think that they
will reject you?

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.030
You have some experience.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:37.470
And you need teachers.

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:38.750
SALMAN KHAN: Absolutely.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.820
ERIC SCHMIDT: You don't replace

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.670
teachers in your model.

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:42.590
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, and
I think that hits

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:44.380
at a bunch of things.

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.900
One is some of the
misperceptions that people

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.640
might have or are having that
when anything virtual shows

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.430
up, that's going to be in
competition for the physical.

00:22:54.430 --> 00:22:57.200
It's Amazon.com versus
Barnes and Noble.

00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:58.980
And from the beginning,
obviously, we were

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:00.290
working in Los Altos.

00:23:00.290 --> 00:23:03.305
We talked about it
in the TEDTalk.

00:23:03.305 --> 00:23:05.250
If you have nothing else,
it should be able to

00:23:05.250 --> 00:23:06.340
stand on its own.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.310
But how does that virtual
supercharge what happens

00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:09.840
inside of the physical.

00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.170
And I think sometimes, the press
narrative, they like

00:23:12.170 --> 00:23:15.260
this one man in a closet story
and he's fighting the

00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:15.990
establishment.

00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:17.980
And so that tends to be the
narrative, no matter

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.360
what we try to do.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.910
But the reality is, from day
one, we were working deeply

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:22.440
with students.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.820
I mean, in those early days,
we had two people in the

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:25.410
organization.

00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.040
And we were working with four
teachers and a bunch of

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:28.720
administrators.

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.920
And a third of our team is
either former teachers,

00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.140
current teachers, and
people who directly

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:35.020
interface with teachers.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.910
We have 20,000 teachers
using it in their

00:23:36.910 --> 00:23:39.980
classrooms as we speak.

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:43.470
And so I think that's, one,
just a misperception.

00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:46.220
I think some of the fair
criticism is-- we get these

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.962
great headlines because
people like the story.

00:23:48.962 --> 00:23:52.140
You know, "The Messiah of
Math." One I liked in

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:57.010
particular, was "The Math of
Khan," which I thought was

00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:59.500
quite good.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:02.000
But there are these
grand headlines.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.840
It's a revolution
in education.

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:06.570
And at some point,
we like that.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.370
It gets people onto the site.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.670
It gets them engaged.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.030
It's kind of validation.

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:12.760
But it risks oversimplifying
it.

00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.280
And I think a lot of
people come back.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.330
No, so there's no
silver bullet.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.560
There's no panacea here.

00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.540
It's just a possible tool.

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.970
And that's something
we agree with.

00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:24.870
We're at the very early stage
of what we're doing.

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.280
It's literally two years since
we got our first funding.

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:28.290
We're 36 people.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.070
We're not a big organization.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:33.380
And we're constantly iterating
on top of that.

00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.370
So yeah.

00:24:35.370 --> 00:24:36.310
I think it's really healthy.

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:38.400
I think it's good that we're
getting this feedback.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:38.960
I call it.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:44.030
ERIC SCHMIDT: So the current
breadth of your classes is

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:46.760
what largely analytical
subjects.

00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.420
And you're sort of jumping
a little bit

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.380
into first year college.

00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:53.360
Where does it go, from a content
perspective, over the

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.360
next five years?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.610
What is your ambition?

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:00.660
SALMAN KHAN: So on the video
side, it's already quite

00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:01.390
comprehensive.

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.870
The videos actually go into even
the financial crisis or

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:07.340
the Greek credit crisis,
things like that.

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:08.980
I want to do a full
MBA curriculum.

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.190
We actually have a gentleman
who's a--

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:11.990
ERIC SCHMIDT: Did
you hear that?

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:12.620
OK.

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.520
How long will it take you to
do a full MBA curriculum?

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.850
I think you have an MBA.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.630
SALMAN KHAN: Yes.

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.570
Yes, so I have a sense.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: So you spent
two years doing an MBA.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:20.170
How long will it take
you to do--

00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:20.640
SALMAN KHAN: And I'll be fair.

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:26.320
I mean the informational part
of an MBA curriculum.

00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:28.230
There won't be the pub crawls
and all of that.

00:25:28.230 --> 00:25:29.532
No, I'm kidding.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.570
What actually is really good--
and I cite that in the book,

00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.550
about what's really good about
business school is that is

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:38.760
actually isn't about information
delivery.

00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:42.690
It's actually about you show
up to class to engage.

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:43.940
And you have these
conversations.

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:44.880
And so yes.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:46.970
You do learn a little bit of
accounting and finance.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:49.700
But the more important thing is
you get all this experience

00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:52.560
from your class and from
the professors.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:56.330
But yeah, when I say that, I'm
saying Capital Markets,

00:25:56.330 --> 00:26:00.460
Corporate Finance,
Basic Accounting.

00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.320
The tools that an MBA would
have, I think would take about

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:02.685
a semester.

00:26:02.685 --> 00:26:06.850
ERIC SCHMIDT: So what's the
sort of event horizon?

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.320
Are you going to teach
literature?

00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.870
Are you going to teach
fine arts?

00:26:10.870 --> 00:26:12.150
Where's the limit
of your model?

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:14.510
SALMAN KHAN: So I'm probably not
going to be the person to

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.180
teach these things.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.480
I might make a cameo,
every now and then.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.380
We actually have two art
historians who are already

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.420
making videos.

00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.880
They've made 300 videos.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.440
And I actually was speaking
at the Crest Foundation.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.850
They're very big sponsors
of art history.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:33.100
And actually, I think we might
be as influential on the

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.790
museum side of things.

00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:38.170
The Google Art Project, our two
art historians were two of

00:26:38.170 --> 00:26:40.290
the primary voices on that.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:42.340
And they have more credible
credentials than I do.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.430
One was a senior person in
art history at the Pratt.

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:47.560
And one was at the MoMA.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.270
And so they've made some
incredible art history videos.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:52.540
I've done a few history
videos.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:54.080
We're thinking about how could
we do more things in the

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.920
humanities.

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.470
And a really interesting thing
is how do we do the

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:58.350
interactive portion
in the humanities?

00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:59.470
It's one thing to do videos.

00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:00.720
But we really want
to do interactive

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.300
content, across the board.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.400
And I think our computer
science, ironically, is kind

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.730
of the direction that
we would go in.

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.330
Our computer science
platform--

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.730
you can go code.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.740
You get feedback.

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:12.150
But you save a portfolio
of your work,

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.480
just like any artist.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.130
You would create a portfolio
of you work.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:16.950
You get feedback from
everyone else.

00:27:16.950 --> 00:27:18.870
Eventually, people would be
able to rate your stuff.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:20.720
And so we imagine doing the
same thing for writing

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.340
assignments or for poetry.

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.320
Or you can even compose
music on the site.

00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.420
And then, other people can rate
how good that music is

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:27.960
and give you feedback.

00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.710
ERIC SCHMIDT: Your computer
science app is an example

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:31.880
where you actually have little
JavaScript programming

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.000
activities.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.425
So that's a variation of
your model already.

00:27:35.425 --> 00:27:36.820
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, exactly.

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.510
I mean, we're not just
about videos.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.050
We're not just about those
original interactive exercise,

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:42.200
which we continue to build.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.170
Computer science was to show
we're serious about really

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:46.640
deepening the level
of learning that

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.480
you can have here.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.110
And it's not just lectures
on computer science.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.550
It's actually a project-y
environment, where you can

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.345
fiddle around and play
with things.

00:27:53.345 --> 00:27:56.600
ERIC SCHMIDT: For everybody's
benefit, I think many people

00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:00.350
don't understand how much a role
Google has played in a

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:01.780
lot of this movement.

00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:02.980
And I'd let everybody know.

00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:04.680
Because I'm very, very proud.

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:07.440
In the typical sort of Google,
bottom-up kind of way, without

00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:10.870
a lot of coordination, the
following things occurred.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:18.120
Peter Norvig and Sebastian Thrun
catalyzed the entire

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.550
large educational thing, with a
series of AI classes and so

00:28:21.550 --> 00:28:24.930
forth, down at Stanford, at
the university level.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.830
We've been working with Coursera
and helped her and

00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:30.670
that whole team get going,
at Stanford.

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.020
Of course, we helped
you, financially.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.430
And you were going to
do well without us.

00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:37.170
But we helped maybe
a little bit.

00:28:37.170 --> 00:28:41.030
We've done a bunch of these
open courses on search and

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:43.770
developer things, for our kind
of technical audiences.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:46.430
And we're getting some
experience with all of these.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:48.540
We, of course, are quite
horizontal, in terms of

00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.295
infrastructure and so forth,
for our kinds of things.

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:59.680
What do you think that
the sum of you--

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.560
you and the five other
very, in my

00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.510
view, courageous groups--

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:07.320
how would you rate
where you are?

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.650
It's only been a couple
of years.

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:10.850
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, and actually,
the MOOC world,

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:14.430
these Massively Open Online
Courses, this is very new.

00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:16.890
I think those first courses
were last year.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.330
ERIC SCHMIDT: 150,000
students, and

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:21.000
universities go crazy.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
They're not quite sure what
to do about this.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.295
People just love the
information.

00:29:24.295 --> 00:29:25.310
SALMAN KHAN: And I think
there's some

00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:27.000
really exciting stuff.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.220
And actually, it should probably
rewind back to--

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:34.050
I guess you'd call it web
1.0, in the late '90s.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:36.380
people were thinking about
online ed from then.

00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.700
MIT, I think, was the first
to step out and do

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:39.530
OpenCourseWare.

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.920
And to large degree, that
inspired Khan Academy.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.150
Khan Academy came out and said,
look, there's a lot of

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.670
traction here, if the form
factor is right, if it's

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:49.900
digestible chunks, if there's
interactivity to it.

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.290
And that's been cited as
inspiring some of this next

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:54.390
wave, Coursera, Udacity.

00:29:54.390 --> 00:29:57.610
And also edX, MIT and Harvard
are doing, and Berkeley.

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:00.670
ERIC SCHMIDT: Do you think that,
10 years from now, this

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.300
will all be old hat?

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:04.820
How much does it change,
over the next decade?

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:05.810
This is version one.

00:30:05.810 --> 00:30:07.740
Presumably version two, version
three, version four,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.240
of your work and their work,
is quite different.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.880
SALMAN KHAN: I think there's
going to be elements of what

00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:14.250
we're already seeing 10 years
from now, but I think it will

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:15.990
be dramatically different.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.760
I think what's going to be
really exciting about 10 years

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:20.600
from now is that all of these
things are going to--

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.340
right now, all of them are
on the learning side.

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.340
Education is this
mix of things.

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.480
It's not just learning.

00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.350
It's the main focus
of education.

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.030
But it's also socialization.

00:30:29.030 --> 00:30:30.460
And it's credentialing.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:32.710
And right now, all of them are
tackling the learning side.

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:34.700
Some of these MOOCs are giving
these certificates.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.590
But they're not mainstream
credentials that have economic

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:40.510
value or they're
authenticated.

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:42.300
This MOOC stuff has
been great for us.

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.280
Because we're like, OK, we're
doing this asynchronous model,

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:45.320
where people can jump in.

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.690
If they want a full narrative,
they can chain them together.

00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:49.130
There's a community.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:50.340
And we're able to reach--

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:53.450
we're at close to 7 million
uniques right now per month.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.800
But they're doing something
slightly different.

00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.260
They're doing a synchronous
model,

00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.185
which is around a classroom.

00:30:57.185 --> 00:30:58.320
It creates these
cohort effects.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.200
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's a much more
structured classroom model

00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:01.220
than using the virtual.

00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:04.565
SALMAN KHAN: But the 100,000, or
sometimes 20,000 to 30,000

00:31:04.565 --> 00:31:06.870
who finish, they're deeply,
deeply, deeply engaged.

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:08.560
And they feel like they're
part of something.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.970
And so we're learning a
lot by observing them.

00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.490
I think it's going back.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:14.180
We're saying, how can we
get the best of that.

00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:15.710
And I think they're saying,
well, how can we get the best

00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:16.770
of the asynchronous.

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.470
I think you're going to see
things like Khan Academy where

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:21.105
you could take flights
together.

00:31:21.105 --> 00:31:23.930
Hey, there's a trip on
algebra at this pace.

00:31:23.930 --> 00:31:26.430
I think the different pacing
is important because people

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:27.600
have other stuff to
do in their life.

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:30.040
Or they just learn
differently.

00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:32.520
There's a cohort of 100 people
leaving tomorrow.

00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.030
You want to join?

00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.360
If there's enough people, there
could be a whole cohort

00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:34.520
with 10 minutes.

00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.250
ERIC SCHMIDT: To travel there.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:35.860
SALMAN KHAN: Exactly.

00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.160
And then you have that
cohort effect.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.590
ERIC SCHMIDT: I think the
biggest thing we haven't

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.880
talked about is your impact
internationally.

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.650
Google, of course, funded
the localization work.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:47.350
And you're busy expanding that
to many different languages.

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:50.260
It must be very satisfying to
feel that people who literally

00:31:50.260 --> 00:31:54.630
have no textbooks are really
reliant on you.

00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:56.110
SALMAN KHAN: It's
been incredible.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.410
We've been doing this
translation

00:31:57.410 --> 00:31:58.600
project for a while.

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.045
And obviously, people have
been consuming it

00:32:00.045 --> 00:32:00.890
in English, as well.

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:03.060
And there's been these NGOs
who have been taking the

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.140
content and at least just the
video content, putting it on

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.840
DVDs and thumb drives and taking
it into villages and

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.070
whatever else.

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.210
But the translation, we've just
surfaced a lot of the

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:14.400
videos that were done, primarily
funded with that

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.530
initial Google grant.

00:32:15.530 --> 00:32:17.910
If you go to the bottom of any
of the Khan Academy pages on

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:19.400
the footer, there's a
little drop-down.

00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:20.130
It says English.

00:32:20.130 --> 00:32:21.030
You drop down.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:24.430
There is, I think, 900 videos
in Spanish, close to that in

00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:25.170
Portuguese.

00:32:25.170 --> 00:32:29.370
Arabic, Bengali, Hindi,
Urdu, Russian, French.

00:32:29.370 --> 00:32:31.960
And so we're starting to get
the international side.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:33.680
And probably the best story that
we've heard, there's a

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.500
group from Cisco Systems who
have been going and installing

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:41.740
computers with broadband in
orphanages throughout Asia.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.760
And they set up one in this
orphanage in Mongolia.

00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.460
And there's this 16-year-old
girl, Zaya, who's started

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.120
using it on her own,
super brilliant.

00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:51.260
We've talked to them
about Zaya.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.620
And she's now our prime
translator into

00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:54.470
the Mongolian language.

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.890
ERIC SCHMIDT: My God, out
of the orphanage.

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.320
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, this
is straight out of

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.090
like Diamond Age.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:01.950
ERIC SCHMIDT: Wow.

00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:04.770
The book is The One
World Schoolhouse.

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.505
And it's coming out
in the next week?

00:33:06.505 --> 00:33:07.830
SALMAN KHAN: No, it
came out Tuesday.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.200
ERIC SCHMIDT: Tuesday, so
it's just coming out.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.420
We have it in the back.

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.950
And you're going to do a Google
Hangout for us on the

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:13.730
17th, right?

00:33:13.730 --> 00:33:14.350
SALMAN KHAN: That's right.

00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:15.860
ERIC SCHMIDT: To try
to promote this.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.330
I think it'd be interesting,
with this kind of an audience,

00:33:18.330 --> 00:33:20.570
to ask people for their
questions or comments on this

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:21.300
or anything else.

00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:26.330
I hope you all understand why
I think this may be the most

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.580
important person we meet,
over the next

00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:30.240
year or two, Sal Khan.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.565
Go ahead.

00:33:32.565 --> 00:33:34.670
AUDIENCE: By the way, just
let me say thank you.

00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:36.910
My daughter, actually, 3--

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:39.390
3 and 1/2 years ago, started
using some of your stuff, when

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:40.160
she was in high school.

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.540
And it was great.

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:45.420
ERIC SCHMIDT: And is this
because it was supplements?

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:46.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:47.270
There were questions.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:48.680
She'd actually transferred
from England.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.500
I wasn't happy.

00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:51.680
And she wasn't happy with what
she'd learned in that school

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.530
system coming into the
school system here.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.520
And she was able to catch up
on some things she didn't

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.260
understand by using
Khan Academy.

00:33:58.260 --> 00:33:59.650
It was marvelous.

00:33:59.650 --> 00:34:01.010
There wasn't an alternative.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.500
But let me ask a
question here.

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:09.880
So the whole flipped classroom
idea is a fascinating one.

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.350
And I think it's going to turn
out to be a very important, as

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:13.520
we've already seen.

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:16.010
But I wonder if there isn't
another kind of flipping that

00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:18.300
we can do here, and a really
important one.

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.810
The process that your system
enables, essentially allowing

00:34:22.810 --> 00:34:26.120
everybody to move at their own
pace and then with the various

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.960
testing and monitoring systems,
essentially sort of

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.989
getting us to the point where
we can pretty much be sure

00:34:30.989 --> 00:34:33.219
that if somebody goes in the
program and stays in the

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:37.310
program, they will come out,
after some amount of time,

00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:39.510
knowing at least some minimum.

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:42.070
We'll be able just pretty
much say, here's a goal.

00:34:42.070 --> 00:34:43.350
Everybody's going to get
at least that far.

00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:44.130
Some may go farther.

00:34:44.130 --> 00:34:46.850
But everybody should at least
get so far, which is not the

00:34:46.850 --> 00:34:48.850
way the systems work today.

00:34:48.850 --> 00:34:52.080
But this introduces, I think, an
interesting opportunity to

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:52.770
switch things.

00:34:52.770 --> 00:34:54.780
And that is switching
the grading or

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:55.880
switching the measuring.

00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.410
Today, what we do is we focus
a lot on measuring the kids,

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:01.010
the students, determining
whether or

00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:02.210
not they're any good.

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.260
But if we have a process that
pretty much says that if you

00:35:06.260 --> 00:35:08.660
follow the process, everybody
gets to the same point, unless

00:35:08.660 --> 00:35:10.260
there's something fundamentally
wrong, it seems

00:35:10.260 --> 00:35:12.840
that we ought to be flipping the
grading and focusing more

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:17.880
on testing and grading
the teaching system.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.130
Because we know what
the end result

00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:20.030
will be for the students.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:21.530
The students will all
know the stuff.

00:35:21.530 --> 00:35:24.100
The question now is, how
effective is the teaching

00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:25.750
system at getting them.

00:35:25.750 --> 00:35:27.010
How quickly can I
get them there?

00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.130
How pleasant can I
get them there?

00:35:28.130 --> 00:35:33.030
So can we see, in the future,
a flipping in the testing,

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:37.613
away from testing the students
to testing the system?

00:35:37.613 --> 00:35:39.770
SALMAN KHAN: Well, I think
there will be interesting

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:40.230
things there.

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.500
Because you get a much richer
data narrative, Pierre, where

00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:46.160
it's not even just snapshot
assessments of the students.

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:48.250
You can actually see how
they're progressing.

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:50.950
You can statistically say, oh,
these are similar cohorts.

00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:52.720
This one seems to be
progressing faster.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.400
What are the variables
that are--

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.350
or maybe, we haven't identified
all the variables

00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:56.770
that are different.

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:57.290
What are they?

00:35:57.290 --> 00:36:00.590
And how could we make other
cohorts perform the same?

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:05.200
On assessing, we haven't given
deep thought to that.

00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:08.330
But I guess it would
be possible.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.800
It brings up something that,
early on, one of my friends

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.270
threw out, which at
first seems like a

00:36:13.270 --> 00:36:14.100
really crazy idea.

00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:15.790
But when we thought
about it, why not.

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:19.170
He's like, well, we should have
up outcome-based tuition,

00:36:19.170 --> 00:36:23.305
where instead of based on how
a year, if we can get you to

00:36:23.305 --> 00:36:24.670
this level of competency,
you'll

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.590
pay 18 years of tuition.

00:36:27.590 --> 00:36:28.750
And they're all better
off because it

00:36:28.750 --> 00:36:29.900
only took three years.

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:34.490
But it does lead to that
interesting thing.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.000
And to the first part of your
comment about the flipping,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.850
which in the book I talk
about, we could go even

00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:40.360
further than that.

00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:43.130
The flip is still kind of within
this Prussian model

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.610
that we inherited from a country
that does not exist,

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.990
this assembly line model.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.190
You literally put these students
in these age batches.

00:36:51.190 --> 00:36:52.280
It's literally an
assembly line.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.410
We don't think of it that
way, but they're

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.720
moving at a set pace.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.610
At every station, something is
applied to them, a little bit.

00:36:57.610 --> 00:36:58.510
It gets different grades.

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:00.110
And at different points,
it's like, oh,

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:01.490
that's a good cranberry.

00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:03.140
That's a bad cranberry.

00:37:03.140 --> 00:37:05.260
And that's going to be for
Whole Foods or whatever.

00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:06.660
And that's going to
go someplace else.

00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:11.700
And we're saying
this is silly.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:16.150
Just get to that outcome where
everything is a good outcome.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.290
But yeah, I think that, in the
near term, what I'm most

00:37:19.290 --> 00:37:21.430
excited about, in terms of
real-- and I think this is

00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:23.730
actually going to happen, when
we talk about five, 10 years.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:25.970
It's the first sign that
the cracks are

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:27.930
emerging in the old model.

00:37:27.930 --> 00:37:29.840
But everyone's improving.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:32.340
I think everyone, across the
board, is fundamentally

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.410
questioning should
they be giving a

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.420
lecture anymore, finally.

00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:39.296
I was on a panel with John
Hennessy of Stanford.

00:37:39.296 --> 00:37:41.460
And we hadn't talked about
it or anything.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:44.770
But he onstage said, look, we're
seriously looking at

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:48.380
whether we really need to give
any lectures anymore.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.430
It's not that they're
going to say people

00:37:50.430 --> 00:37:51.360
shouldn't gather together.

00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:53.480
But when they gather together,
it shouldn't just be like

00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.070
taking notes.

00:37:54.070 --> 00:37:55.710
And you don't know the other
people in the room.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.170
It should be interacting
with each other.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:37:59.640
It should be getting help from
the professor in the TAs and

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:00.610
everybody else.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:03.080
AUDIENCE: So teaching would no
longer be a performance art?

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.516
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yeah.

00:38:04.516 --> 00:38:06.260
SALMAN KHAN: Unless you have
a YouTube channel.

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: I would encourage
you to consult the

00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:11.020
leader of the Chicago Teachers
Union, as to timing.

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:11.950
Yes, sir.

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:13.480
AUDIENCE: It's very impressive,
of course, what

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:13.840
you've done.

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:14.830
I had two questions.

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.390
The first is, your point about
being able to look at remedial

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:20.160
stuff is great.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.870
In your videos, do you have
pop-ups or overlays that show

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:28.900
the topics that students might
want to read up on, during

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:29.490
that topic?

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:33.250
Like when you're doing algebra
and adding fractions with

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.820
unknowns, is there
a quick link to

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.210
get to adding fractions?

00:38:38.210 --> 00:38:39.940
SALMAN KHAN: The problem
[INAUDIBLE].

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.010
And this is something that-- so
the simple answer is yes.

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:45.340
And then, the more complex
answer is, we think it's not

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:48.060
ideal, the way the site
is set up right now.

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:51.180
The videos kind of took a life
of their-- in the old days,

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.140
actually the videos
were there to

00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:53.840
complement the problem sets.

00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:56.140
So the way I viewed it is,
this thing generates

00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:56.800
problems for you.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.300
It can give you hints,
if you need it.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.340
And if you really need it,
you might need a video.

00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:02.200
Because I used to say, hey, the
hints are probably good

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.620
enough for you.

00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:05.360
That's how I used to
tutor my cousins.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:06.986
Give them a problem, if they had
a little trouble, I'd give

00:39:06.986 --> 00:39:09.080
them a little intuition
or a little hint.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.820
And then later, the videos
took a life of their own.

00:39:10.820 --> 00:39:13.330
And then later, when we got
resources, we started

00:39:13.330 --> 00:39:15.550
investing again in the
problem generator.

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:17.100
And so our problem has been the

00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.470
connections and the narrative.

00:39:18.470 --> 00:39:19.910
And where do people go?

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:21.780
And we're starting to do
that curation process.

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:22.690
You can do it already.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:23.510
Both already exist.

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:24.430
And there are linkages.

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.910
They're not ideal right now.

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:29.540
What we're launching to kind
of get the best of the MOOC

00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:32.310
world and the asynchronous
world is we're

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.440
calling them tutorials.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.900
So a tutorial, in our mind, is
not a semester commitment.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:39.410
It's a collection of things that
is roughly a one-hour to

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:42.270
one-week commitment, that's
around an idea, like

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:45.760
photosynthesis or entropy
or whatever it might be.

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.670
It'll be video, video, exercise;
computer science

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.580
simulation; video, video,
exercise; community or

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.570
open-ended thing.

00:39:52.570 --> 00:39:54.800
And so yeah, the goal
is exactly that.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.730
But things like fractions
already are connected.

00:39:57.730 --> 00:39:59.330
If you do the fraction
exercises,

00:39:59.330 --> 00:39:59.930
the videos are there.

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.325
The video is there with the
fraction exercises.

00:40:01.325 --> 00:40:02.420
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, sir.

00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:05.030
AUDIENCE: So thanks for
a great interview.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:06.920
To expand on one of the previous
questions, one of the

00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:11.350
biggest impacts a teacher can
have on students is not

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:14.240
delivering information but to
inspire them, to actually make

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.340
them interested in
the subject.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:22.220
How do you envision your work
helping them do that?

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:24.520
SALMAN KHAN: There's a couple
of dimensions here.

00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:26.710
On the simplest dimension, what
we saw a Los Altos even

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.270
two years ago, is we did
it just by giving them

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:30.770
the room to do it.

00:40:30.770 --> 00:40:32.620
You take that lecture
out of the room.

00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:35.780
And you actually take a lot of
the administration out of the

00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.650
room in terms of grading
homework.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:39.370
And you take that out of the
room, Now&gt; all of the sudden,

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:42.300
the teacher has what they want
to do with the classroom.

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.320
And some of those teachers
that we worked with were

00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:45.840
incredible.

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:47.960
They had a list of things that
they really wanted to do.

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.070
They were doing these
really interesting

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:50.740
projects that were inspiring.

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:53.240
They were like, for the first
time, I'm able to spend some

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:54.750
time with every student
in the classroom.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:57.470
Literally, just talking to
someone on a personal level is

00:40:57.470 --> 00:41:00.610
inspiring them, as opposed to
being distant from them.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:02.190
But on top of that,
we do realize--

00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.770
we've been saying, class
time should be used for

00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:04.025
interaction.

00:41:04.025 --> 00:41:06.090
It should be used
for projects.

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.170
Projects are not a
trivial thing.

00:41:08.170 --> 00:41:11.230
It's very easy to have bad
projects, cookbook projects.

00:41:11.230 --> 00:41:14.750
And so that's why we wanted
to put resources into this

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.540
computer science.

00:41:15.540 --> 00:41:17.050
Because it's so general.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.120
It can be used in anything.

00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.660
I just made a video for--

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:21.450
LeBron James literally reached
out and said, I want to help

00:41:21.450 --> 00:41:24.320
make math videos.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: This
never happens.

00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.296
SALMAN KHAN: This
never happens.

00:41:27.296 --> 00:41:28.195
ERIC SCHMIDT: It's
like the fifth

00:41:28.195 --> 00:41:28.940
thing that never happens.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:30.330
SALMAN KHAN: This is the fifth
thing that never happens.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:30.870
ERIC SCHMIDT: Did he call you?

00:41:30.870 --> 00:41:31.760
Or did you call him?

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.410
SALMAN KHAN: No, he called us.

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.423
I mean, his people
called my people.

00:41:35.423 --> 00:41:40.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:44.030
SALMAN KHAN: But he asked these
interesting questions

00:41:44.030 --> 00:41:44.460
related to math.

00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.500
One of them is, you have 30
seconds left, down by three.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.640
Is it better to shoot the three
or take the two, foul,

00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.850
hope for another possession?

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.540
ERIC SCHMIDT: These are problems
that have occupied

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:56.980
him for some time.

00:41:56.980 --> 00:42:00.440
SALMAN KHAN: Well, it
a core problem.

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:02.270
And it's funny.

00:42:02.270 --> 00:42:03.370
Because at first, I was
like, I'm going to

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.240
make a video for it.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:07.080
And I started doing a decision
tree for it.

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.840
And actually, there's a second
scenario that gets quite

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:10.670
complicated, based on the
did they make one free--

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:12.530
how much time went off the
clock, and all that.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.780
I said, I have this great
computer science tool now.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.930
So I did a Monte Carlo
simulation, for LeBron James.

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:20.620
ERIC SCHMIDT: This has
also never happened.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.470
SALMAN KHAN: This has
also never happened.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.040
But it's exciting.

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.210
Because then, we've gotten
all these letters

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.980
from very young kids.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:29.900
A Monte Carlo simulation is a
very simple thing, actually.

00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:32.410
And immediately, it started
sparking their imagination

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:33.700
about a million different
things.

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:35.680
There's so much sports
statistics out there.

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.900
You could leverage those
sports statistics.

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.710
And now that you have a pretty
easy-to-use coding platform to

00:42:40.710 --> 00:42:43.050
do some really, really
interesting kind decision

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:45.530
analysis, and frankly, stuff
that I don't think even some

00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:48.260
of the people in the head
offices of some of the sports

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.380
teams have actually done.

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:51.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:54.390
AUDIENCE: So you've done some
amazing things helping people

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:55.710
actually learn stuff.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:42:57.520
And that's mostly
what schools do.

00:42:57.520 --> 00:42:59.810
But they do one other thing
that's important, which is

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:02.870
they certify that this person
has a reasonable knowledge of

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.810
this topic.

00:43:03.810 --> 00:43:07.530
I was wondering if you had
an thoughts on fixing or

00:43:07.530 --> 00:43:10.730
improving the system of
standardized testing.

00:43:10.730 --> 00:43:11.970
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:13.800
Really, what you're talking
about is credentialing.

00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.980
How do people prove to the world
that they've learned

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:17.910
something now that there are all
these great resources to

00:43:17.910 --> 00:43:19.030
actually learn?

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:21.680
And I think there's a bunch of
interesting things here.

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:22.840
I mean there's a big movement.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.310
And a lot of these things have
always been out there.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:25.270
People have talked about it.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.280
But now, there seems to
be some traction.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.360
It's generally called
competency-based learning,

00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.290
instead of it being based
literally on seat time.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:32.340
And then, you just
get promoted.

00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:33.540
Look, you can take as
long as you need.

00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.590
And when you feel you're
ready, you go

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:36.170
take a proctored exam.

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.130
It should be a rich exam.

00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:38.350
It could be even an oral exam.

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:40.440
And you prove that you
actually know it.

00:43:40.440 --> 00:43:42.560
And I frankly think that's
going to be especially

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.630
powerful at the higher
education level.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.840
And one thing that I'm
particularly excited about--

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.800
and I'd be interested in
collaborating with any of you

00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:52.850
all that want to work on
something like this--

00:43:52.850 --> 00:43:55.590
I think computer sciences
is actually the

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:56.650
ripest fruit there.

00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:59.880
Because we hire on a much
smaller scale than you guys.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:02.130
But we are also looking
for incredible people.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:09.330
And when we look GPAs, great
universities, it's a filter.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:11.210
And we probably have a lot
of false negatives.

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.670
There's a lot of great people.

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:15.600
John Resig, he's the world's
most known JavaScript

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.950
programmer, wrote jQuery.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:20.810
In his cover letter, he
literally wrote I started

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:22.090
jQuery project or whatever.

00:44:22.090 --> 00:44:23.650
And I was like, I guess we
should interview him.

00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.260
But later, I asked him.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.360
I said, where did you
go to school?

00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:28.865
He said, Rochester.

00:44:28.865 --> 00:44:30.420
I said, oh, that's
a good school.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.070
But what was your GPA?

00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.520
1.9.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.060
ERIC SCHMIDT: He was too busy
programming in JavaScript.

00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:36.840
SALMAN KHAN: It might
have been 2.0.

00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:37.370
Don't quote me.

00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:39.310
I think it was 1.9 or 2.0.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.320
It might have been a
little bit higher.

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:44.590
But it was not a resume that
would typically make the cut

00:44:44.590 --> 00:44:46.550
at a Google or Khan Academy.

00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.360
But it pointed to me what's
wrong with our process.

00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:55.680
He's an off-the-charts brilliant
guy, fun to work

00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.650
with, everything.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:44:58.580
What happened?

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.310
He said, well, I was
working on jQuery.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.410
And so we're missing those
people, unless they do

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.170
something really
off-the-charts,

00:45:05.170 --> 00:45:06.310
like what he did.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:09.900
And so I think there should
be independent processes.

00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.590
And then, when you go and
actually get an interview

00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:13.500
here, we all make you go to
the whiteboard and write

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.310
bubble sort.

00:45:14.310 --> 00:45:16.260
Or how to do sort this?

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.820
Or how do you find the edge of
this boundary or whatever.

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.880
And it's inconsistent.

00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:20.410
Some are hard.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:21.140
And some are easy.

00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:22.900
There might be some great people
who just having anxiety

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.910
coding at a white board while
someone's watching them.

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:28.660
And so I think there is
something that could be done

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:31.930
where people go take maybe
a proctored, or at least

00:45:31.930 --> 00:45:34.750
authenticated, series
of challenges.

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.690
And that's used as really a
credential or a filter, for

00:45:38.690 --> 00:45:40.260
people like us to see
where talent is.

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.714
ERIC SCHMIDT: Did you
have a question?

00:45:41.714 --> 00:45:43.280
AUDIENCE: Hi, Sal.

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.950
Thanks for everything you do.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:48.210
So at Google, we get to work
with a lot of great teachers

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:50.960
who are forward-thinking and not
afraid of your model, not

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:53.110
afraid of employing the flipped
classroom and being

00:45:53.110 --> 00:45:54.990
more of a guide on the side.

00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:58.040
But there are a ton of teachers
who are afraid of

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:58.590
what you're doing.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.410
They feel like if this happens,
they're all going to

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.010
take away our jobs.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:04.940
And they're the gate keepers
to the kids.

00:46:04.940 --> 00:46:06.640
So how do you reach
those teachers?

00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:09.165
And how do you reach, by
extension, those kids?

00:46:09.165 --> 00:46:12.740
SALMAN KHAN: I think the main
point is kind of-- actually,

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:17.730
that was one of the main hopes
of this book, to make it clear

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:19.780
that it's not about--

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:22.890
because, as was talked about
before, teaching was viewed as

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:24.320
a performance art before.

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:28.220
And so it was kind of ingrained
in people that's

00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:29.670
where the value was.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:32.890
And to kind of, I think, get
more people thinking in this

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:35.090
direction is for everyone
to realize that isn't

00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:35.940
where the value is.

00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.910
And this isn't just
lip service.

00:46:36.910 --> 00:46:40.420
The value really is on working
deeply with students,

00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:42.520
mentoring them, forming
connections with them.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:45.240
And I think when you phrase
it that way, most

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.040
teachers really get it.

00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.580
And whenever I talk to people,
this isn't an assault on you.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.360
I think, unfortunately, most
of the public debate is an

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.420
assault on teachers.

00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.830
And they group them
all together.

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.400
And they make all sorts of
sweeping statements.

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.120
This is an assault on a
system that has been

00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.310
constraining you.

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.340
It's whenever people
get worried.

00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:05.510
The US is right behind Estonia
when it comes to factoring

00:47:05.510 --> 00:47:06.210
polynomials.

00:47:06.210 --> 00:47:09.310
All going to fall apart now.

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:12.620
The reaction from government
is, let's put

00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.260
more tests on it.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:17.290
And there is a rationale
to that.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:20.230
And it might de-risk some
of the worst performing

00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.900
situations.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.880
But it also completely handicaps
everyone else.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.560
And it makes our system,
frankly, more Prussian.

00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.800
It makes it more rigid,
more controlled.

00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:31.700
And everything that we're trying
to promote-- and this

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.770
is what I tell every teacher.

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.540
And I think when they understand
that, they get

00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.830
really excited about it.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:39.000
It's about going back to the
teacher really being able to

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.970
define the experience in really
interesting, creative

00:47:41.970 --> 00:47:44.780
ways but have tools that make
sure that the academic rigor

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.620
is still being achieved.

00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.570
You know, when I was a tutoring
my cousins, this is

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:48.060
what I wanted.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:49.970
There's all sorts of fun stuff
I want to do with my cousins.

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.020
I want to teach them about
a Monte Carlo simulation.

00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:54.450
But at the same time, I also
want to make sure that they're

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:56.130
reaching certain achievement
goals.

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.800
And so I can keep track of
that asynchronously.

00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:01.570
I can manage the chaos
so to speak.

00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.460
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, sir.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:05.300
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.480
This is inspiring.

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:11.200
And it's inspiring to the extent
that I've taken on a

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.740
challenge to really change the
way that I do a little bit of

00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.890
my own teaching.

00:48:14.890 --> 00:48:17.480
I have taught a citizen
schools class,

00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:19.380
for some time now--

00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:21.740
since before I got to
Google, actually--

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:26.490
trying to teach sixth graders
computer science and algebra

00:48:26.490 --> 00:48:27.920
at the same time, since the

00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:29.470
fundamentals are really together.

00:48:29.470 --> 00:48:30.390
SALMAN KHAN: There's some good
tools for that now, too.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.700
AUDIENCE: Really very core--

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:37.190
And in particular, to try to
motivate them with gaming

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.190
context, creating video games.

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:44.180
The challenge that I have,
that's not so much like the

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.380
normal classroom challenge, is
the kids have to be really

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.570
motivated on their own.

00:48:48.570 --> 00:48:49.580
Because there's no credit.

00:48:49.580 --> 00:48:50.440
There's no nothing.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.030
This is an after school
activity.

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.110
If they're going to watch
anything at home, they have to

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:56.530
do it because they want to.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.500
And two is I don't know that
some of these kids from the

00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:04.530
Bronx have tools at home with
which to go and view videos,

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:09.580
to go and play with the
computers, et cetera.

00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.530
One, I'd like to sort of ask
your advice on those kinds of

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:13.040
challenges.

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:15.720
But also I'd like to ask your
advice really on just how to

00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.280
prepare videos that are
that engaging for

00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.450
a sixth grade audience.

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:22.790
What are the things I should
be paying attention to?

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.530
SALMAN KHAN: I'll
take the first.

00:49:24.530 --> 00:49:27.410
In terms of access issues,
that's a real issue.

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:30.360
There has even been a few
charter schools where the

00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.710
school was able to get
laptops or computing

00:49:33.710 --> 00:49:35.030
devices to the students.

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:37.220
But then, they get beat up on
the way home and someone takes

00:49:37.220 --> 00:49:38.880
it from them.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:44.250
And so the near-term solution
seems to be keep the school

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:46.500
open a little bit longer, have
a computer lab, partner with

00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:47.920
the Boys &amp; Girls Club,
someplace where

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.740
they can access it.

00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:51.970
I mean, which is essentially
saying it's actually hard for

00:49:51.970 --> 00:49:53.440
them to be able to access
it at home.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:53.950
But that's OK.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:54.750
They're accessing it.

00:49:54.750 --> 00:49:56.230
And actually, that serves
a double purpose.

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:57.210
And I write a lot about that.

00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:59.020
It's crazy that school
ends two hours before

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:00.720
parents come home.

00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:03.880
It actually fills in that gap,
especially where both parents

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:04.320
are working.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:08.700
And so it also solves
that need.

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:13.340
In terms of the motivation,
I think you're right.

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.200
One thing I write about is
getting rid of summer-- summer

00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.040
vacation, not summer.

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.340
I like the season.

00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:20.300
But getting rid of
summer vacation.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.900
And immediately, the people's
rational, that's when I did my

00:50:22.900 --> 00:50:26.550
most like creative stuff, really
self-directed things.

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:28.300
Those are my best memories
from childhood.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.090
And when I point out those best
memories, and a lot of

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:32.800
people just waste
their summer.

00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.510
But if you're lucky enough to
have those experiences, that's

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.710
actually what your full school
day should look like.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:38.040
It should be much more--

00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.200
you set your goals.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.880
But you have mentors who are
restructuring them--

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.300
really how a lot
of environments

00:50:43.300 --> 00:50:46.090
like this might work--

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:47.660
who are pushing you forward.

00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:50.290
So there's not a simple
solution, while

00:50:50.290 --> 00:50:51.210
there's this hybrid.

00:50:51.210 --> 00:50:52.970
While there's this separate
thing, where it's like, if you

00:50:52.970 --> 00:50:54.810
don't pass this test tomorrow,
you're going to fail.

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:56.160
And there's all these
repercussions.

00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:58.070
And you're trying to do
something interesting.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:50:59.570
And it gets squeezed out, even
though the students are

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.070
probably more motivated to
do what your working on.

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.160
It's probably more important
for them in

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.340
the long term, too.

00:51:04.340 --> 00:51:05.280
But it's hard.

00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:09.920
In terms of the videos
themselves, this is the thing

00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:12.760
I famously have gotten in a
little trouble on a couple of

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:16.340
networks where I say-- well, I
sometimes don't know what I'm

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:17.770
going to say before
I make a video.

00:51:17.770 --> 00:51:20.280
They say, oh, my God,
how irresponsible.

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.190
That video is going to reach
millions of people.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:28.100
And I think what I was saying
is that the video itself

00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.730
should really be coming
from you.

00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:32.160
It should be really you
thinking out loud.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.700
It should be very
conversational.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.450
It shouldn't be scripted.

00:51:36.450 --> 00:51:38.200
There are people actually who
do good scripted videos.

00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.200
They're able to read it very
naturally, in a quirky way.

00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.260
But my style is more
conversational, down-to-earth,

00:51:44.260 --> 00:51:46.680
thinking it through out loud.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:49.510
But I do put a lot of time on
the preparation, in terms of

00:51:49.510 --> 00:51:51.110
thinking it through, just
doing it in my mind.

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:53.710
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's try
to sort of speed

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.480
this up a little bit.

00:51:54.480 --> 00:51:55.070
Yes, ma'am.

00:51:55.070 --> 00:51:57.760
SALMAN KHAN: Just as one minor
point, if there are a couple

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.210
of people who want to join
us, it would be awesome.

00:52:00.210 --> 00:52:01.060
We need one or two more.

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:02.020
ERIC SCHMIDT: Go ahead.

00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:02.740
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:05.540
So we had a chuckle about the
Chicago teachers' union

00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:08.630
reference, but between the
teachers' unions and the

00:52:08.630 --> 00:52:10.730
educational institutions,
there are some serious

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:12.330
roadblocks in the system.

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:14.110
You're a small team of folks.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:17.890
So I'm wondering how we, as
parents and good community

00:52:17.890 --> 00:52:23.410
citizens, can help further the
cause of education reform.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:26.370
SALMAN KHAN: I think we
have been a grassroots

00:52:26.370 --> 00:52:28.790
word-of-mouth story, like
Eric introduced.

00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:32.210
And so I think the more of
that we get, the better.

00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:33.820
I mean nothing is more powerful
than one parent

00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:35.730
telling another parent, or one
student telling another

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.255
student, and one teacher telling
another teacher, or

00:52:38.255 --> 00:52:39.200
one parent telling a teacher.

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.120
So I actually think we are
going to be a teacher and

00:52:42.120 --> 00:52:43.510
parent-led grassroots thing.

00:52:43.510 --> 00:52:45.150
So for us, I would just
say more awareness.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:49.180
ERIC SCHMIDT: Systems
never self-reform.

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:51.610
It's a bad lesson of life.

00:52:51.610 --> 00:52:52.680
They don't self-reform.

00:52:52.680 --> 00:52:54.630
It requires external pressure.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:59.680
So my blunt answer is the
educational system is run for

00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.000
the benefit of the adults
and not the

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.010
children, in aggregate.

00:53:03.010 --> 00:53:06.520
And that it's our responsibility
as parents to

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.650
get that fixed, somehow.

00:53:10.650 --> 00:53:11.610
Yes, sir.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:13.070
AUDIENCE: I just want
to say first

00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.030
thanks so much for coming.

00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:16.050
You're a huge inspiration
to me.

00:53:16.050 --> 00:53:20.250
And it's great to have people
like you here at Google.

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.140
Before I started at Google, I
was an educational consultant.

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.850
And one of things we really
promoted was the use of

00:53:25.850 --> 00:53:28.950
Chromebooks with Khan Academy
as a cheap, effective way to

00:53:28.950 --> 00:53:30.830
have an effective
learning suite.

00:53:30.830 --> 00:53:32.600
And the teachers were
really into it.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.340
Where we ran into problems was
the actual institution itself

00:53:36.340 --> 00:53:40.000
because schools get money from
government, based on test

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.150
score results, et cetera.

00:53:42.150 --> 00:53:45.970
What are the reforms that you
think need to happen?

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:47.860
What do you think
is the timeline?

00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:49.090
Just help please.

00:53:49.090 --> 00:53:53.390
SALMAN KHAN: I'm not an expert
on the structural architecture

00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:55.010
of what might keep--

00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:56.780
there's weird things
about things being

00:53:56.780 --> 00:53:58.430
blocked or laptop carts.

00:53:58.430 --> 00:53:59.420
And there's a lot times
where we're like,

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.540
look, this is obvious.

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.850
You don't even need one laptop,

00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:02.950
necessarily, per child.

00:54:02.950 --> 00:54:04.690
Because they're not using
them the whole day.

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:06.410
So there's some way that
maybe two or three

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:07.380
could share one laptop.

00:54:07.380 --> 00:54:09.580
But there's a lot of weird
structural things about how

00:54:09.580 --> 00:54:10.420
it's organized.

00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.310
I'm not an expert here.

00:54:11.310 --> 00:54:13.570
I think the best way is to
really show exemplars that are

00:54:13.570 --> 00:54:14.896
doing it really, really well.

00:54:14.896 --> 00:54:17.480
ERIC SCHMIDT: And I want to
thank the Chrome team for the

00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:19.740
donation that you and the
other members made.

00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:21.960
It actually made a nice,
big difference for the

00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:22.620
Chromebooks.

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.342
And obviously, we'll be
doing more of that.

00:54:24.342 --> 00:54:25.980
AUDIENCE: I'm not
on Chrome, but--

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:27.490
ERIC SCHMIDT: Well, thank you.

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:30.340
SALMAN KHAN: Thank you
for what you do.

00:54:30.340 --> 00:54:31.720
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's run
a little quickly.

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.230
Go ahead.

00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.916
Yes, ma'am.

00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:35.730
AUDIENCE: I'm from a rural town
in South Carolina, and

00:54:35.730 --> 00:54:37.470
I've been trying to find
ways to improve the

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:38.665
school system there.

00:54:38.665 --> 00:54:41.090
And I've looked into things like
KIPP, but they require

00:54:41.090 --> 00:54:42.430
just a complete overhaul.

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:43.260
And I was wondering--

00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:45.800
they do have sort of a training
process for how to do

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:46.520
this in places.

00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.030
And I was wondering if, in
implementing Khan within the

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:52.050
school, are you looking at
having a training program for

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:53.600
how that this can be
done and spread?

00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:54.180
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.660
So we do have a team that is
interfacing with schools,

00:54:57.660 --> 00:54:58.540
learning from schools.

00:54:58.540 --> 00:55:00.710
Their feedback comes back
to our product.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:03.240
But then, on top of that, they
document what is working.

00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:05.660
If you go to
khanacademy.org/toolkit,

00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:07.990
that's where it's kind of the
place for teachers or anyone

00:55:07.990 --> 00:55:09.440
who's going to be
a coach really.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.280
You run an after school program,
or anything, how they

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:11.790
could use it.

00:55:11.790 --> 00:55:12.890
ERIC SCHMIDT: She's
exactly right.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.060
You need to have a little
subsection which is how to

00:55:15.060 --> 00:55:17.230
implement this if you're
the school.

00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:18.050
SALMAN KHAN: No, that's right.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.450
ERIC SCHMIDT: It needs
to have that as its

00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:21.345
title, just do this.

00:55:21.345 --> 00:55:23.190
SALMAN KHAN: Exactly,
step one, step two--

00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:25.430
so we're trying to do as much
as possible self-service.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.493
And then, they also
do run workshops.

00:55:27.493 --> 00:55:29.030
ERIC SCHMIDT: Yes, sir.

00:55:29.030 --> 00:55:31.370
AUDIENCE: Our education system,
on all levels, is full

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:35.190
of really good teachers and
also really bad teachers.

00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:37.190
Have you considered reaching
out to those exceptional

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:40.030
teachers, who actually reach out
to students, who say, oh

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:41.800
wow, I love learning
this stuff.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.070
This guy makes it make
sense to me?

00:55:43.070 --> 00:55:46.100
Have you considered reaching out
to these teachers saying,

00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:49.110
OK, this is the guy who should
teach biochemistry?

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.650
This is the guy who should teach
maybe some subject that

00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:53.360
you're not an expert in,
something like that?

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:54.638
SALMAN KHAN: Are there any?

00:55:54.638 --> 00:55:55.920
No.

00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:59.500
There are many, most.

00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:02.300
The simple answer is
yes, absolutely.

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.670
So there's been a couple
of short term

00:56:04.670 --> 00:56:05.360
things that we're doing.

00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.400
One, we do have this contest.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.250
The close was October 2.

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:11.770
And we're in the process of kind
of reviewing this Next

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:14.730
EDU Guru, with YouTube,
which is to find--

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.560
I think it's gotten several
hundreds of applicants.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.270
So hopefully, we find some
interesting people there.

00:56:20.270 --> 00:56:22.970
And on our side, on our
platform, one of the goals is

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:25.335
this platform has been built
around my content and now a

00:56:25.335 --> 00:56:25.960
few other people--

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.470
Vi Hart, and we have our
art historians--

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:30.410
but it can be a generalized
platform.

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:33.530
And so we want to allow,
hopefully in the next six

00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:35.170
months, anyone to
start creating

00:56:35.170 --> 00:56:37.960
tutorials on our site.

00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.170
And then, maybe we can start
to recognize the tutorials

00:56:40.170 --> 00:56:42.155
that are resonating with people
and maybe bring them

00:56:42.155 --> 00:56:42.560
into the fold.

00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.410
ERIC SCHMIDT: Let's have these
be the last two questions.

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:45.000
Yes, sir.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:46.740
AUDIENCE: First, thank you.

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.260
Khan Academy is the reason that
my wife passed physics.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:52.380
SALMAN KHAN: Oh, tell her to
make a YouTube testimonial.

00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.890
I'll put it in the slide deck.

00:56:53.890 --> 00:56:55.330
AUDIENCE: I actually will.

00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:56.210
SALMAN KHAN: No, I'm serious.

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:57.650
ERIC SCHMIDT: By the way,
that's wonderful.

00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:58.730
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:56:58.730 --> 00:56:59.370
That's incredible.

00:56:59.370 --> 00:56:59.680
ERIC SCHMIDT: That's wonderful.

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.044
Go ahead.

00:57:01.044 --> 00:57:05.180
SALMAN KHAN: When you talk about
the Prussian model, the

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:10.200
assembly line model of education
and that the Khan

00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.600
Academy tools free up educators
to abstract away

00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.540
that portion of things so that
they can focus on interesting

00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:21.680
projects and so on, how would
you respond to the worry that,

00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.630
if all the education system is
interested in is that assembly

00:57:24.630 --> 00:57:26.380
line aspect, they could
replace the

00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.640
entire school system?

00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:30.120
You mentioned that there's
a significant worry that

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.990
educators have that the entire
teaching industry could--

00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:36.390
we're all going to lose
our jobs and so forth.

00:57:36.390 --> 00:57:41.760
And completely divorced from any
intentions that you have,

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.530
That by providing this really,
really useful and wonderful

00:57:44.530 --> 00:57:46.620
tool, this could be
a negative impact.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.970
How would you address that?

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:50.320
SALMAN KHAN: I actually think
that's a fascinating question.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.900
It's something we've
thought about.

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.990
It's interesting because people
always say, what about

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:56.040
this accrediting body.

00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.570
And this is what the
universities care about.

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.020
And this is what the state
standards are, and all this.

00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:04.660
But if you really think openly
about the whole ecosystem, the

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:09.120
end consumer of whatever the
system is are the Googles of

00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:12.350
the world, are the Facebooks of
the world, are the Goldman

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:16.260
Sachs, are the hospitals of the
world, I mean the firms of

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.320
the world are the ones
who are consuming it.

00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.130
And I think they've, if
anything, been screaming for--

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:23.810
yes, we want people that have
shown competency in algebra

00:58:23.810 --> 00:58:24.980
and have good SAT scores.

00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:26.550
Yes, that's one dimension.

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:29.650
But I think all of you recognize
that we are looking

00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.990
for people who are capable of
actually creating things.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.490
And our current system--

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:34.450
this is the biggest problem.

00:58:34.450 --> 00:58:37.160
We interview people with
straight A GPAs from the top

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.170
universities.

00:58:38.170 --> 00:58:39.810
And we say, what
have you made?

00:58:39.810 --> 00:58:41.600
And they haven't made anything
because they were too busy

00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.670
getting the really good GPA.

00:58:43.670 --> 00:58:44.440
They're smart people.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:46.940
They're capable, but
they didn't do it.

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.540
And so I think the fact if we
collectively, as an ecosystem,

00:58:50.540 --> 00:58:52.460
start demanding-- and we
are demanding it--

00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.590
then these will be valued.

00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:55.410
And there's two dimensions.

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:57.200
One dimension is the academic
achievement

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.230
that's already there.

00:58:58.230 --> 00:59:01.080
And I think, even there, the
human component will always be

00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.170
super, super important.

00:59:02.170 --> 00:59:03.870
I mean, we can do one
thing maybe for very

00:59:03.870 --> 00:59:04.900
self-motivated student.

00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.980
Just purely with virtual,
they could do a lot.

00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:09.970
But having peers in your
classroom to bounce ideas off

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:12.450
and work with and having
teachers that can mentor that

00:59:12.450 --> 00:59:14.870
will only supercharge
that even more.

00:59:14.870 --> 00:59:17.150
But the other two dimensions
which I think are equally or

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:20.370
more important than that, that
are not measured today, are

00:59:20.370 --> 00:59:22.710
how good are you at mentoring
others and explaining to

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:25.700
others and having empathy
for others.

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.560
And we can actually start to
assess that, with peer-to-peer

00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.920
review, ratings, how much
time you're putting it

00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.810
on behalf of others.

00:59:32.810 --> 00:59:35.380
And that, hopefully, will be
another kind of SAT score of

00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:36.590
the future.

00:59:36.590 --> 00:59:39.270
Another thing would be
dimensions like perseverance.

00:59:39.270 --> 00:59:40.630
Because now you have
a data narrative.

00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:43.010
It's not just a snapshot
assessment.

00:59:43.010 --> 00:59:43.660
You had trouble.

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:44.480
But did you persevere?

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.480
To some degree, I might want the
kid who took two months to

00:59:46.480 --> 00:59:48.350
learn negative numbers because
he persevered, as opposed to

00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:50.830
the person who just
got it like that.

00:59:50.830 --> 00:59:53.565
And the last dimension is a
portfolio of creative works.

00:59:53.565 --> 00:59:54.370
ERIC SCHMIDT: Thank you.

00:59:54.370 --> 00:59:55.362
And our final question.

00:59:55.362 --> 00:59:58.860
AUDIENCE: So you briefly
mentioned internationalization

00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:00.420
and translation.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:02.170
I know it might be hard
to get numbers or

01:00:02.170 --> 01:00:03.760
information from here.

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:08.070
But what have you seen in terms
of rural areas or areas

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:11.900
in the developing world where
there might not be a classroom

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:13.880
or there might not
be teachers?

01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:15.180
Are you getting good
usage there?

01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:17.325
How is that changing things
in those locations?

01:00:17.325 --> 01:00:20.170
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah, what's hard
there is that's obviously hard

01:00:20.170 --> 01:00:22.440
to measure because a lot
of those are offline.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:25.460
But anecdotally, there's a lot
of NGOs who are going out

01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:27.550
there and taking the content.

01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:28.380
And they tell us.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.210
And they take pictures.

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:31.060
And that's all we
can tell now.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:34.160
What will be exciting, over the
next four or five years,

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:36.200
as the broadband or at least
some level-- it doesn't have

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:36.770
to be broadband.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.270
It could be very low but at
least enough to keep track of

01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:42.300
what's going on.

01:00:42.300 --> 01:00:44.350
For the last 100 years, people
have wanted to set up schools

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:45.180
in a village.

01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.320
And no one has any idea
of what's happening.

01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:49.600
I think what's exciting is, in
the next five years, people

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.070
will start to know
what's happening.

01:00:51.070 --> 01:00:53.390
How are people engaging
with the content?

01:00:53.390 --> 01:00:55.920
ERIC SCHMIDT: My final question
for you is-- we have

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.750
all of Google here and through
our video conference, as you

01:00:58.750 --> 01:01:01.310
know, around the company.

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.660
And obviously, Google is a huge
supporter of what you're

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.910
doing for all the reasons that
you see from the questions.

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:09.460
What is the list of things
that Google could do that

01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:11.120
would make you even
more successful?

01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:13.570
Obviously, continue the
success of YouTube.

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:14.830
We're wiring up Kansas City.

01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:16.170
Maybe even wire up some
other cities.

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:17.070
SALMAN KHAN: We use
App Engine.

01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:18.360
ERIC SCHMIDT: You
use App Engine.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.440
Excellent, any complaints
about App Engine?

01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:20.970
SALMAN KHAN: No.

01:01:20.970 --> 01:01:21.780
So far, so good.

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:23.580
ERIC SCHMIDT: So far, so good.

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:24.770
What are some other things
Google could

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:25.988
do to support you?

01:01:25.988 --> 01:01:31.850
SALMAN KHAN: I don't know how
frank I should be on this.

01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:33.750
There's a lot.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:37.700
But I think awareness
is a huge thing.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.610
That's hopefully
an easy thing.

01:01:39.610 --> 01:01:40.820
I think feedback.

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.650
I think there are ways that
we could work together.

01:01:42.650 --> 01:01:44.540
I think some of these things
like creating credentialing

01:01:44.540 --> 01:01:45.905
architecture.

01:01:45.905 --> 01:01:48.290
I think that's a game changer,
if we could do it together.

01:01:48.290 --> 01:01:50.690
And obviously, if we have people
like Google, one, to

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:52.610
help develop the credentials
themselves--

01:01:52.610 --> 01:01:55.280
ERIC SCHMIDT: And we have a
project called Course Builder,

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.620
which is underlying
infrastructure.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:59.650
So you might argue that would
be an extension of a Course

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.120
Builder-type project.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:02.770
SALMAN KHAN: And the course
builds on the learning.

01:02:02.770 --> 01:02:05.720
But this is really like, OK,
even if you didn't get a CS

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.780
degree from anywhere.

01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:09.090
This is something that-- if you
get through this series of

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:11.530
things, Google will take
a serious look at you.

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.620
Other software companies will
take a serious look at you.

01:02:13.620 --> 01:02:15.570
If you do, the rest of the
ecosystem will as well.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:17.210
ERIC SCHMIDT: We could sort
of set that standard.

01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:18.190
And then, everybody
else would follow.

01:02:18.190 --> 01:02:20.900
SALMAN KHAN: Every other company
in the world would

01:02:20.900 --> 01:02:21.530
take it seriously.

01:02:21.530 --> 01:02:24.580
ERIC SCHMIDT: What do you want
the parents or future parents

01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:27.890
in this room to do to change
the school systems?

01:02:27.890 --> 01:02:31.170
Because most of these people in
front of you don't really

01:02:31.170 --> 01:02:32.650
have a school choice.

01:02:32.650 --> 01:02:34.490
They have a public school.

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:36.370
They may or may not have access
to a charter school.

01:02:39.130 --> 01:02:41.650
SALMAN KHAN: As before, I think
it's parents telling

01:02:41.650 --> 01:02:43.180
parents, raising awareness.

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:46.540
If you each of you went and told
100 people, it would be a

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.750
pretty epic in terms of the
awareness that's happening.

01:02:49.750 --> 01:02:52.830
On top of that, I think there
could be an element of, if you

01:02:52.830 --> 01:02:55.750
can, talk to teachers
that are in your

01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:57.050
child's life about this.

01:02:57.050 --> 01:02:59.380
And tell them this isn't
about replacing you.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.850
This is really, I think,
something you're going enjoy.

01:03:00.850 --> 01:03:02.053
ERIC SCHMIDT: And address
their fears.

01:03:02.053 --> 01:03:02.980
SALMAN KHAN: Address
their fears.

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:04.110
ERIC SCHMIDT: Their fears
are all obvious.

01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:06.100
And I think we've
discussed them.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.600
SALMAN KHAN: Yeah.

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.180
And I think anything you
can do to kind of

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:10.130
push people's thinking.

01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:12.840
Show examples of what
can happen.

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.590
Maybe you could self organize
and make your own little

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:18.250
boutique school that really
pushes the envelope of things,

01:03:18.250 --> 01:03:19.640
but any of the above.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.450
ERIC SCHMIDT: So the book of
course is The One World

01:03:21.450 --> 01:03:25.580
Schoolhouse coming
out two days ago.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.070
Not only have I read it,
I've endorsed it.

01:03:28.070 --> 01:03:28.890
You should read it, too.

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:31.360
Thank you very much, my
true hero, Sal Khan.
