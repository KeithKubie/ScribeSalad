00:00:07.286 --> 00:00:08.910
MALE SPEAKER: Good
morning, and welcome

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.310
to the first Talks
at Google of the year

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.580
here in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.180
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce Amir Aczel.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.560
Dr. Aczel is here to
discuss his new book,

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.510
"Finding Zero-- A
Mathematician's Odyssey

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.660
to Uncover the
Origins of Numbers."

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.990
This is the amazing story of his
lifelong obsession with finding

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.720
the origin of the
numbers we use every day

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.260
and have been using for
centuries and the journey that

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.715
took him around the world
to answer his questions.

00:00:41.715 --> 00:00:43.860
Did I mention the
story is amazing?

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.190
You are absolutely going to
love this book, absolutely.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.700
Dr. Aczel has
degrees from Berkeley

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.690
and the University of Oregon.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.930
He's the author of over 20
general books and textbooks

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.610
including "Fermat's
Last Theorem."

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.400
He's been a Guggenheim
Fellow and a visiting scholar

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.980
in the History of
Science at Harvard.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.620
Since 2003, he's been
a research fellow

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.740
with the BU Center
for Philosophy

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.640
and the History of Science.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.150
And as of 2011, he's been
teaching math courses

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.880
at UMass Boston.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.650
Please join me in
welcoming Amir Aczel.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.150
AMIR ACZEL: Thank you.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.170
Thank you very much.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.790
It's really a great
pleasure and a great honor

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.965
for me to be here at
Google in Cambridge.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.230
As you mentioned,
I've written 20 books,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.130
and they're all about other
people, interesting people.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.660
"Fermat's Last Theorem"
got me to write

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.290
about Andrew Wiles and other
amazing mathematicians.

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.380
I wrote a book about Descartes,
and a couple of books

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.130
about Einstein.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.860
And this book is about me.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.940
So it's a very, very
different story.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.810
And the reason I had to
sort of-- it's not about me,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.380
but I had to write in
the first person, which

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.590
is very unusual for me.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.450
And it took a lot of
time to get used to.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.450
It's almost like you're
writing about yourself.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.850
And the reason was that I had
this obsession about trying

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.440
to trace the numerals, the Hindu
Arabic numerals, and especially

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.590
the zero.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.380
And I wrote a book proposal.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.680
When you're a writer, you
have to write a proposal.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.930
The book doesn't write itself.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.480
And you need a publisher
to be interested in it.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.680
And this is the first book
in 20 that no publisher

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.430
was interested in.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.880
I went to all the
publishers in New York,

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.180
and they all turned it down.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.065
And the reason is that
the main character--

00:02:43.065 --> 00:02:45.190
one of the reasons, the
main character in this book

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.660
is not like Einstein or
Andrew Wiles or Descartes.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:51.150
It's a very boring guy.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.614
He's this French academic
by the name of Coedes.

00:02:54.614 --> 00:02:56.780
And he was so boring that
every publisher would just

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.529
read the proposal, and
they throw it away.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:59.380
It's boring.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.680
So I was very depressed.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.860
I didn't know what to do.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.520
I mean, this is the
topic I care a lot about,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.400
and I can't write a book.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.090
So I just got worse and worse.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.360
And I got physically
ill at some point.

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.610
And I was about to
give up on everything.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.260
And then, I got this grant
from the Sloan Foundation,

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.390
and I thought, wow.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.120
They trust me to
write this book.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.620
So I have to do it.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.600
And the grant was to try to
rediscover the earliest zero.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.390
Now, the zero is
discovered by the Maya,

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.490
and the Maya calendar
has a glyph for zero

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.294
which is like a crescent moon.

00:03:40.294 --> 00:03:41.460
But that didn't go anywhere.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.200
That remained in Mesoamerica.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.310
But there is a zero
that became our zero.

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.490
And it was studied by
this guy that I mentioned,

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.650
Georges Coedes,
this French scholar.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.350
And it disappeared.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.780
And I wanted to find
it again to bring it

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.250
to the attention of
the world of science.

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:02.530
And it was also an
excuse to travel.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:06.720
So if I can have the first
slide, that would be great.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.630
So everybody knows the
numbers come from India.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.450
Every Indian you
talk to will say, oh,

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:19.610
we invented the numbers.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.300
And we invented the zero.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.980
And so I sort of
took it by faith.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.670
This odyssey of looking
for the first zero

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:32.470
was really an adventure to
try to find the first zero.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.300
And it got me talking
to a lot of people,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.830
emailing, phone
calling, writing letters

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.890
to some people who
are less accessible.

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.650
And at the conference
in Australia,

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.540
I met an Indian
researcher by the name

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.610
of C. K. Raju who gave a talk
at this international conference

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.650
at the University
of New South Wales.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.420
And he said, people, you
don't really know this.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.320
But the Indians
invented everything.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.720
Einstein's relativity
came from India.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.260
And Euclid's theorems
come from India.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.510
The Pythagorean theorem
was invented in India.

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:10.740
And he went on and on.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.770
The audience got very upset.

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.960
They would have pelted
him with rotten eggs,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.350
but they're slightly
more polite,

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.470
and there were no eggs around.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.510
At any rate, everybody
got very irritated.

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.950
But when I got the
grant, I thought, well,

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:29.970
he seems to know about India and
the things that happened there.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.360
And so I went to
India to meet him.

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.490
So India has a lot of temples.

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:38.390
And there are markets where
you can buy manuscripts.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.340
And I was sort of
looking for things,

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.270
like a fishing expedition.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.250
Let's see what I can find.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:51.720
And I came into contact with
a Japanese mathematician

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.215
who had traveled, by the name
of Hiyashi, Takao Hayashi, who

00:05:57.215 --> 00:06:03.030
had traveled to this part of
India called Khajuraho which

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.270
has these really amazing
statues on temples.

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.800
And they get more and
more graphic, let's say.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.610
But I took out all
the slides that

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.660
were more explicit
because there's really

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.460
no end to how
graphic they become.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.730
And people go there
from all over the world

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.540
to see these statues.

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:33.160
There's some hints of them.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.570
I don't know, maybe not.

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.660
Maybe I was censoring
this too much.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.130
And then, there are all
these erotic statues.

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:43.080
And then, there are numbers.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.010
And this is a magic square
that was known since the 1800s.

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.510
But after a while,
Hayashi found it.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.310
But he forgot where it was.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.600
So he told me it was
somewhere in Khajuraho.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.840
So I spent a day looking for
it, and I rediscovered it.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:10.360
If you Google Khajuraho, you
will find that magic square.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.500
But there's no photograph
of it because nobody

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.540
knew where it was.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:18.800
And it's rewritten
in our numerals.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.860
But since you're all
brilliant people,

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.600
I'm sure you can figure
out these numerals.

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.610
So they're different from ours.

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:29.820
And don't be fooled if something
looks like our numeral.

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:31.810
It's not.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.930
They are very different.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.420
Some of them are similar
and almost the same.

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.790
But they're really
mostly very different.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.950
My wife, who is not
a mathematician,

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:44.380
figured it out in
about 10 minutes.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.350
So I'm sure some of you
maybe already figured it out.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.160
So you know about
a magic square.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.370
A four by four magic square,
a normal magic square,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.830
a regular one, it has
the numbers from 1 to 16.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.220
Has to have a sum of 34.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.330
It's an easy proof, too.

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.590
You can probably prove
it to yourselves.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:06.430
So knowing that the sum
of everything is 34,

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:10.410
you can do it mathematically
by setting up equations.

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.590
But you can also do it the way
my wife did, just by guessing,

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:15.210
I guess.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:19.360
And it's a cool exercise
to try and do it.

00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:22.430
I went there because I was
fascinated by the magic square.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:25.670
But I also wanted to
see early numerals.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:26.970
I said 11th century.

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.262
We don't really know.

00:08:29.262 --> 00:08:34.400
On Wikipedia, it
says 10th century.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.280
It's either 10th
or 11th century.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.630
It's very early.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.510
Four by four, three
by threes have

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:44.225
been known in
Persian and in China

00:08:44.225 --> 00:08:45.600
and different
parts of the world.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.520
A four by four is
more complicated.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:53.460
And if you set the sums, what's
cool about this magic square

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.550
is it's not only the two
full diagonals, all the rows,

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:06.020
and all the columns, but also
every four by four in a corner,

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.160
like the-- oh, two
by two in a corner.

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.460
The one on top, to the
right and to the left,

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:14.040
and the central one.

00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:17.800
So this is a very
sophisticated magic square

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.330
that has many possibilities
of adding to the sum of 34.

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.110
Which, I think, is magical.

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:28.690
Maybe that's why they put it
next to all these very strange,

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:35.650
sensuous statues and
phrases all over.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.450
And nobody knew where it was.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:39.930
I had to ask maybe 30 people.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.220
And then, there was
a French tourist

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:43.760
who heard me ask his guide.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.110
And he said yes, I've seen it.

00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:49.870
And it's in a different part
of Khajuraho, less visited.

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:53.160
So the main part is the
western group of temples.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.770
And this is in the eastern
group, which is across town.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:00.300
There's nobody there except
dogs and a few children

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.640
begging for money.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.220
For some reason,
nobody goes there.

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:06.440
And this is at the
Parshvanath Temple,

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:12.530
which is what that piece
of information was lost.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:14.990
And here's a better view of it.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:17.650
So I forgot to tell
you the best part.

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:18.950
So I did go there.

00:10:18.950 --> 00:10:21.800
And I did trace also the
earliest zero in India

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.480
to a place called
Gwalior, and that zero

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:30.960
comes from the mid 9th
century, 850 something.

00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:38.100
And there was a big controversy
in the '30s and '20s

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.600
about who invented the zero.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:44.620
There was a British scholar
by the name of G. R. Kaye,

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.570
K-A-Y-E, who was actually
an expert on India,

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:49.010
but was very racist.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:51.490
And he claimed that the
Indians didn't invent anything,

00:10:51.490 --> 00:10:55.290
sort of the opposite
of C. K. Raju today.

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.370
And he was the first person to
study the Bakhshali manuscript,

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.620
which is very important in
the history of mathematics,

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:03.080
but undated.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.090
If they could date it-- it's
made of bark, tree bark.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.260
If they could just
take a tiny bit of it

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:10.680
and radiocarbon date it, the
whole history of mathematics

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.770
would come into much,
much clearer view.

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:17.020
And we would know what the
sequence, the chronology,

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:17.850
was like.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:19.870
But the Brits don't
allow you to do that.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.970
It's in Oxford, at the library
there, at the Bodleian Library.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.600
And so we don't know.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.730
It could be first few
centuries, even BC or AD,

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:32.020
around that time.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:33.670
Or it could be 1200.

00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:37.900
So he claimed that it was 1200s,
1300s, something like that,

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:39.450
Kaye himself.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:43.752
And he dissed the Indian
chronology by saying,

00:11:43.752 --> 00:11:45.710
well, the Indians claim
that their history goes

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:47.360
back several million years.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.500
So of course they don't know
what they're talking about.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:53.930
And he claimed, his theory
was that the zero was

00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:56.210
invented either in
the West, in Europe,

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:59.530
and brought through
Arab trade to the east,

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:01.500
or the Arabs
themselves invented it.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.000
It's unlikely that
the Indians had

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.080
anything to do with the zero.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:11.030
So there is this guy by the
name of Georges Coedes who is

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:15.390
originally a Hungarian Jew
who immigrated to France

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:18.350
and changed his name so
it looks very French with

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:22.550
the C-O-E-D-E-S and
an accent grave,

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:28.000
and the O and the E are
ligated, and so it looks very,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.470
very French.

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:34.630
And he just had this
natural ability--

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.320
I'm very fascinated by people
who have a natural ability

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.430
to do things.

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:42.185
Ramanujan comes to mind, as
a mathematician, just out

00:12:42.185 --> 00:12:44.500
of the blue can come up
with these identities.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.950
And nobody understands
where they come from.

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.760
And he can just invent
or discover them.

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.390
And he said a goddess, I guess,
from one of these statues,

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:57.210
the Hindu goddess Parvati
gave him all this information.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:13:00.900
And you all know the
story about Hardy,

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:03.390
great mathematician,
British mathematician,

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.470
brought him to England
and tried to figure out

00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:07.300
how he got this knowledge.

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:11.950
And Coedes had a similar
ability of understanding

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.590
dead languages, like old Khmer.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:17.730
He could read a stele, and
within a short period of time,

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.450
translate it.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.390
Just an incredible gift.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:25.860
And he ended up translating
into French 2,000 steles

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:30.980
in Cambodia and Thailand.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:35.140
And one of these steles that
he found had an early zero.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:41.500
The problem with the Indian zero
in Gwalior is that it's 800s.

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:45.400
And that's coincidental with
the caliphate in Baghdad,

00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:49.460
the big, very
extensive Arab trade.

00:13:49.460 --> 00:13:51.860
So if you have a zero
in India from that time,

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.300
it could've come
there from Europe

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.680
or from the Arabs,
or the other way.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.070
There's no conclusive proof.

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:58.528
But if you could--
what Coedes knew

00:13:58.528 --> 00:14:03.160
was that if he could find a zero
that's earlier than Gwalior,

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.020
the earliest Indian
zero, he could

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.170
prove that the zero was an
eastern invention because it

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.130
predates that Arab trade.

00:14:10.130 --> 00:14:11.890
And that's exactly
what he found.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.120
He found a zero in Cambodia.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:18.820
And basically was
able to completely

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.815
destroy the theory of
Kaye, and to establish

00:14:21.815 --> 00:14:23.250
that the zero is Eastern.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:26.340
But everything that he
was basing this theory on

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:27.050
disappeared.

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.130
The reason it disappeared was
because of the Khmer Rouge.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.050
So I knew that, and that's what
I got the grant from the Sloan

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.940
Foundation, to try and
find, to rediscover

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.790
the stele that may or
may not still exist.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:41.590
We didn't know.

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.340
But I guess they had faith that
maybe I'll be able to find it.

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.050
And once I got the grant,
it's like, I had to do it.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.390
I had to find it.

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:54.020
So my first stop after going
to India was to go to Bangkok.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:58.960
And I kind of used this
as just a great, fun city

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:04.540
to go to and an excuse to show
pictures of places I like.

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.260
This is one port and temple
there, and all these Buddhas.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:13.970
And it doesn't want to go.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:18.770
And of course, all the
pickpockets are not Thai.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:20.525
They're foreign, foreign.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.350
And so this is why I went there.

00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:34.060
I couldn't write-- the software
wasn't written by Google,

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:35.640
so it doesn't work very well.

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:40.080
It doesn't allow you to
write the name correctly.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.105
The font is-- I wasn't
able to add all the French.

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:52.460
OK, so you say, why did
you go to all these places?

00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.160
So I need to explain this.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.840
Once I started
researching it, I sort of

00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:03.350
became obsessed with the
philosophical idea of,

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.950
why the zero?

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.550
Why would the zero be
invented in the east and not

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:09.110
in the west?

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:11.910
And it was, I think,
we know conclusively

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:14.290
that it's an eastern invention.

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:16.280
I call it an invention.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.090
Of course, mathematicians
would argue

00:16:18.090 --> 00:16:20.610
is it an invention or discovery?

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:25.200
Most mathematicians I've polled,
including some people we've

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.550
talked about earlier,
most mathematicians

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:30.152
think, of course,
that numbers exist.

00:16:30.152 --> 00:16:31.610
They're the Platonic
point of view.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.830
The numbers exist
regardless of us.

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:35.830
But the ability
to write something

00:16:35.830 --> 00:16:37.620
is sort of an invention.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.300
You invent the zero.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.400
And the zero that I'm
interested in here

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.990
is not the zero, just
an idea of emptiness,

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:47.520
even though it's
very interesting.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.930
But the zero as a placeholder
which allowed our number system

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:52.900
to work so well.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:56.780
If you try to construct
a multiplication using

00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.490
Roman numerals,
then you can see why

00:16:59.490 --> 00:17:05.369
our numerals are so much better.

00:17:05.369 --> 00:17:08.859
So what happens algebraically,
when you add the zero,

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.490
you turn it into a ring.

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.970
And you can do things.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:16.349
And these are stacked
rings for each decimal,

00:17:16.349 --> 00:17:17.849
for each position.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.839
And you couldn't do that
without something like a zero

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:22.800
because you need to
hold an empty space

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.930
for the further ones.

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.319
So you can write 2 is just 2.

00:17:27.319 --> 00:17:31.200
But 2 followed by 0 is 20 or
200 with two 0's, and so on.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.220
So it's also an
intellectual idea

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:39.010
for creating a number
system-- and it's independent

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:40.014
of the base, of course.

00:17:40.014 --> 00:17:41.430
It doesn't matter
whether the base

00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:45.290
is 8 or 10 or 2, the way
a computer would work.

00:17:45.290 --> 00:17:50.020
So the idea of
doing that is really

00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:54.680
what gives our numbers
their efficiency and power.

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:57.330
But the idea of
writing something

00:17:57.330 --> 00:18:01.010
that means nothing,
there's so many, of course,

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.250
people play with language.

00:18:02.250 --> 00:18:04.910
Nothing means nothing, or
nothing means everything,

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:05.500
and so on.

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:09.170
So nothing, the idea of nothing,
is a sophisticated idea.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:13.140
And I became convinced,
maybe for no reason,

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.150
that it's an eastern
idea for a reason.

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.530
And that it may have come from
Buddhism, the void in Buddhism,

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.030
you know?

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:23.340
When you meditate, if
you're a Buddhist, I guess.

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:25.350
You imagine the void.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:27.750
And so I went to
Luang Prabang in Laos,

00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:32.490
because that's the one
town in the world that

00:18:32.490 --> 00:18:36.830
has more Buddhist
monks per square foot

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:40.400
than anywhere in the world.

00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:45.100
And it's also a very
interesting place.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.080
Has anybody been there?

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.880
I would go there
soon because it's

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.560
a gem that's going
to be destroyed.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.830
They're building a
high speed rail line

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.510
from China and a new airport.

00:18:58.510 --> 00:19:03.320
And it's a very
authentic town that's

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:06.880
both French colonial and
Asian at the same time.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.260
You can see their art is
very intricate and different

00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:12.870
from what you see in Thailand.

00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:18.930
So I was talking
to all these monks.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:25.090
And I became convinced
that yes, the zero

00:19:25.090 --> 00:19:28.120
does come because they even
tell you, when we meditate,

00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.100
we think of the void.

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.360
And then, we start counting.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:33.490
So from emptiness,
there's a one, two,

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:36.580
and we count when we breathe
in and we breathe out.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:40.870
And so I think it's
logical that the void does

00:19:40.870 --> 00:19:42.500
come from some eastern idea.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:48.260
Maybe not Buddhism, but the
eastern mind of the early

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:53.070
centuries was able to
conceive of nothingness.

00:19:53.070 --> 00:19:55.700
And the Mekong goes
through this place.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:20:01.020
And 200 kilometers
southeast in that direction

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.999
is where the earliest
zero was found,

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:04.540
in a place that
looks just like this,

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:08.540
but it is just further south.

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:12.950
There was a temple
there dated to 683.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.920
So it's 200 years
before Gwalior.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.540
And that's where
Coedes found his zero.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.130
There's the Mekong again.

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:25.640
So I finally got serious
about this search.

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:27.290
And I knew I had
to go to Cambodia

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:32.910
to try to find this lost
stele with the first zero.

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.450
It's not necessarily
the first zero.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:39.820
In the 80 years that passed
since Coedes analyzed it,

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.650
nothing else was
found that's earlier.

00:20:41.650 --> 00:20:46.250
So it's the earliest
because of that,

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.320
because we don't have
anything earlier than that.

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.240
But likely, the zero was
invented before that.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:55.610
Coedes defined these
civilizations as Indianized

00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:59.140
because they were Hindu
and later Buddhist and back

00:20:59.140 --> 00:20:59.640
to Hindu.

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:02.320
There's a back and
forth with religions.

00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.190
So if you've been to Angkor Wat,
it was built as a Hindu temple

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:10.210
to Vishnu, and then became
Buddhist, and Hindu,

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:13.700
and Buddhist, and depending
on the kings which ruled.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.080
But this is Phnom
Penh, and I went

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.840
there to meet the Deputy
Minister of Culture and Fine

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.920
Arts of Cambodia because after
about two years of emailing,

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:32.910
writing, phone calling,
I got to this person who,

00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:36.120
for some reason,
agreed to talk to me.

00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.960
And I needed doors opened to me.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.520
Otherwise, I couldn't
find anything.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.560
And I don't know why, this is
a guy-- Hab Touch is his name.

00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.900
They called him His
Excellency, Hab Touch.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.560
And he goes around the world.

00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.160
He comes to New
York often to try

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.800
to get back to Cambodia all
the lost art that was sold out

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:01.306
of the country during the
years of the Khmer Rouge rule.

00:22:01.306 --> 00:22:03.430
Maybe you've read about it
in the "New York Times."

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.096
There are stories
about it all the time.

00:22:05.096 --> 00:22:07.460
And he goes to all the
museums in the world

00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:09.380
and tries to negotiate
the return of the art.

00:22:09.380 --> 00:22:12.410
For some reason, he thought
that maybe this was interesting.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:13.280
And I met him.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:15.210
And then, he sent
me to this place,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:17.220
which is near Angkor Wat.

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:20.950
This is called Bayon, which
is outside Angkor Wat, built

00:22:20.950 --> 00:22:22.780
by Jayavarman VII.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:25.550
And the zero is there.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:27.370
But I didn't know that.

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:31.990
He just sent me there
and told me to look.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:35.310
These are the faces
of Jayavarman VII,

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:38.990
the great Buddhist King
who built Angkor Wat.

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.860
So there's a place
near Angkor Wat

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.560
in a clearing in
the jungle that's

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.820
called Angkor Conservation.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:51.200
And after all these years
and months of searching,

00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.700
I came there.

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:58.790
And a phone call from this
man opened the doors to me

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.540
because this is
closed to the public.

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:02.100
Nobody can go there.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.910
And what it is is a repository
for all the art that

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:08.720
was destroyed by
the Khmer Rouge.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:12.010
They tried to restore it,
but mostly they do nothing.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:16.240
It's just a storehouse.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.360
This is in a shed that's about
twice the size of this room.

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.960
And that's what you see there.

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.620
And the great statues,
they were just destroyed.

00:23:25.620 --> 00:23:27.820
At some point-- I don't
have a slide of that,

00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:31.530
but an archaeologist
there showed me

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:35.560
a statue where you can see
clear marks of destruction.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.310
So the Khmer Rouge were a
little bit like the Taliban.

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:42.090
I don't know if you
remember before 9/11,

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:48.030
maybe a few years before, they
blew up those two large Buddha

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:52.770
statues in Afghanistan
for no reason.

00:23:52.770 --> 00:23:55.930
And the Khmer Rouge
did the same thing.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.440
They weren't Muslim.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.230
I guess they were
Communists, the Khmer Rouge.

00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:04.400
They tortured and
killed 1.7 million

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.840
of their own people, Cambodians.

00:24:08.970 --> 00:24:10.960
And then, they
destroyed all the art.

00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.450
So I'm not sure why they
would want to do that.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:21.790
But so the place is full
of this just discarded art.

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:24.440
And I had to look through it.

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:27.730
They told me, if it exists,
then maybe it's here.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:30.710
But they may have destroyed it.

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:33.010
So there it is.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:34.330
I found it.

00:24:34.330 --> 00:24:38.650
So it took a while, maybe
half a day going through.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:39.680
And I finally found it.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:45.060
This is K-127, the
number Coedes gave it.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.330
This is from behind.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.740
And this is from the front.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:55.660
And here are two pictures
of the front of this stele.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:03.950
And the zero is dead center
on the right photograph,

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:05.090
right there.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:06.260
And this is what it says.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:10.310
It says, the Caka 605 year
began on the fifth day

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.080
of the waning moon.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.890
And 605, this is better.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:19.860
So you can see the
zero is the dot.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.100
So why the dot?

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.830
A zero discovered sometime
later in Indonesia

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:30.640
is a year younger than this one.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.470
So this is the
oldest zero we know.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.599
And apparently, the
Khmer Rouge didn't

00:25:35.599 --> 00:25:36.640
think this was important.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.530
And that's why it
survived destruction.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:41.360
There is damage to
it, but maybe it

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.400
was the Khmer Rouge-- I have no
idea-- but not the part that's

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.020
important.

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:48.960
You can see the damage on the
last slide, on the top there.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:52.370
We don't know whether this
damage was done by the Khmer.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:54.190
It doesn't look like
a statue, so they

00:25:54.190 --> 00:25:57.890
wouldn't have wanted to
destroy it necessarily.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:26:01.090
But it does have damage in
the top and on the side here.

00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:06.620
And you can see the zero on the
second line from the bottom.

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.550
So why is it a dot?

00:26:08.550 --> 00:26:10.780
The other zero from
Indonesia, which

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.670
is-- so I need to explain
the dating, though.

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.790
So Caka began in 78 AD.

00:26:18.790 --> 00:26:22.190
And this is the year
605 of the Caka era.

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:27.410
And so 605 plus 78 is 683, which
is a prime number, by the way.

00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:31.740
So 683 is the date.

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.810
And therefore, it's two
centuries earlier than Gwalior.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:37.780
And there was no extensive
Arab trade at the time,

00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:39.600
and this is further east.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:44.320
So that is very strong
proof of the hypothesis

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:48.950
that the zero is indeed
an eastern invention.

00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:52.450
The Arabs today
use a dot for zero,

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:54.360
a circle, an uneven
circle that's

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:58.060
kind of fatter on
the bottom is a five.

00:26:58.060 --> 00:26:59.520
And the dot is a zero.

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.470
And we use a circle as a zero.

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:04.350
So it is a good question.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.600
Why was it a dot or a zero?

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.500
But apparently the
two forms still

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:12.150
co-exist and evolved
at the same time.

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.970
The zero, circular
one in Indonesia,

00:27:14.970 --> 00:27:17.840
and this dot in Cambodia.

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.520
And these cultures were
Indianized in the sense

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.900
that they were
Hindu at the time.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.580
And this comes from
a Hindu temple.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:33.840
And they used Sanskrit
in addition to old Khmer.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:39.210
So the story would end
now, but it didn't.

00:27:39.210 --> 00:27:41.770
Because I was stupid.

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.520
I'm standing there,
looking at it.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.129
And I was euphoric.

00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:48.920
I thought, I finally
found-- took me really

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.250
five years to find it.

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:53.060
I didn't know what to do.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.496
Suddenly, these two women
walked into this shed.

00:27:55.496 --> 00:27:56.870
Nobody ever comes
into this shed.

00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:59.636
And they're wearing lab
coats and speaking Italian.

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:01.010
And as I described
in the book, I

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.360
was raised on a cruise
ship in the Mediterranean.

00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.580
I speak French and
Italian fairly well.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:09.470
And I'd been
traveling for months

00:28:09.470 --> 00:28:12.140
and didn't talk to anybody
other than these phone calls

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.180
and trying to beg
people for information.

00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:17.926
And usually somebody
says, oh, I know

00:28:17.926 --> 00:28:19.300
somebody who might
know somebody,

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:21.360
and that kind of thing.

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:23.360
It was just this
kind of research,

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.570
like trying to find somebody who
knows somebody who might know

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.880
something or might
talk to you about it.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.880
And I got a lot of nos.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.630
The director of the
museum right there

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.840
just refused to talk to me.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.060
And the head of this
place, Angkor Conservation,

00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.650
just hung up the phone on me
and, in an email, told me,

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:42.750
I can't talk to you.

00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.583
And that's why I had
to go to the government

00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:46.589
to go over their heads.

00:28:46.589 --> 00:28:48.130
And then, of course,
they were there.

00:28:48.130 --> 00:28:50.770
But so these two women walk in.

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:51.570
They speak Italian.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.310
So I started to speak
Italian with them.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:55.980
And I said, you know, this is
the oldest zero in history?

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.540
And they said, really?

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:58.920
Thank you so much
for telling us.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.100
We'll take it.

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.580
And they took it.

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.830
So it weighs a couple of tons.

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:04.850
They didn't take it right away.

00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:06.980
But they said, we
run a lab here.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.950
And we teach the
Cambodian students

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.739
how to restore
archaeological artifacts.

00:29:12.739 --> 00:29:14.280
And since you told
us it's important,

00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.340
we'll use that,
all these stones.

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:19.510
And it looks fine to me.

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:22.640
I hate to have
somebody restore it.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.680
This is crazy.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.740
And I tried to say,
there's nothing.

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.820
No, no, we'll take it.

00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.230
And they took it.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.330
So this archaeologist from
Palermo who runs this place

00:29:33.330 --> 00:29:36.335
has control of all the artifacts
because the Cambodians can't

00:29:36.335 --> 00:29:37.210
handle it themselves.

00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:39.930
So they got somebody from
the University of Palermo

00:29:39.930 --> 00:29:43.010
to come and teach them
how to do archaeology.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:44.120
And she's in control.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:46.030
And so I told her
it was important.

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.460
She took it, and she went
to write articles about it.

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:50.790
And she took it into her lab.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.970
And I thought,
OK, it's lost now.

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:55.620
I went back to Bangkok,
and an art dealer

00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:58.450
who helped me on my way
said, it's lost now.

00:29:58.450 --> 00:30:00.330
The mafia is going to
get its hands on it.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:01.930
She's from Palermo.

00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:05.370
And it will be sold
somewhere in the world

00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.377
for millions of dollars.

00:30:06.377 --> 00:30:07.210
It's the first zero.

00:30:07.210 --> 00:30:08.750
You told me it's important.

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:10.205
It's gone.

00:30:10.205 --> 00:30:11.690
There's nothing you can do.

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:15.560
I came back to Boston
after everything.

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.290
I found it, and now it's gone.

00:30:18.290 --> 00:30:20.660
I thought it should
be in a museum.

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.570
And then I thought, the
grant had run out long ago.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:26.240
And so I paid my own
way back to Cambodia.

00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.349
I went back to Phnom Penh.

00:30:27.349 --> 00:30:28.890
I stayed in the same
hotel from which

00:30:28.890 --> 00:30:31.110
that picture was taken
that I showed you.

00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:36.500
And I asked for a meeting with
Hab Touch, his excellency,

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.100
the Deputy Minister of
Culture and Fine Arts.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.750
And he came to the
hotel to meet me.

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.240
And I thought,
I'll wait for him.

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.870
He said, no, wait in your room.

00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:46.078
I'll come, and I'll call you.

00:30:46.078 --> 00:30:47.920
And he came, and we had
dinner in the hotel.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.080
And I took my PC,
and I showed it.

00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.940
And I said, here, this
is the oldest zero.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:54.490
And you helped me find it.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:56.323
If it hadn't have been
for your phone calls,

00:30:56.323 --> 00:30:58.021
I wouldn't have
been allowed there.

00:30:58.021 --> 00:30:59.270
And he said, that's wonderful.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.190
It belongs in a museum.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:01.898
And I said, that's
where I want it to go.

00:31:01.898 --> 00:31:04.610
And he says, I want you to
write the description of it.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:05.771
And I wrote one right away.

00:31:05.771 --> 00:31:06.770
And I emailed it to him.

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:07.811
And he said, don't worry.

00:31:07.811 --> 00:31:09.470
It's going to go to the museum.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:11.500
This was in 2013.

00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:16.570
I rediscovered this
stone on January 2, 2013.

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:18.480
And nothing happened.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:20.020
I emailed him again.

00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.130
Not a word.

00:31:21.130 --> 00:31:24.720
I thought, maybe my friend
in the gallery in Bangkok

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.250
was right.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.140
It's probably sold
at auction somewhere.

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:28.220
It's gone.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:30.480
They won't talk
about it anymore.

00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:32.180
And then, my sister died.

00:31:32.180 --> 00:31:36.380
So it seemed like it would
have nothing to do with this,

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:38.970
but it did.

00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:43.250
My sister was interested in
Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.400
era in particular.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.820
It's because of
her interest in it

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.140
that I got interested
in Southeast Asia.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.000
And that's what got me to do
this research even before I

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.060
started to do the research.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.420
And when she died, she
left some amount of money.

00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:03.850
And I thought, I
can commemorate her

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.170
by paying for this piece
to be moved to the museum.

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:12.020
So I emailed them, and they
hadn't been answering me

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.640
for months, maybe over a year.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.530
And the minute I
mentioned money,

00:32:16.530 --> 00:32:20.000
not only His
Excellency responded,

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.410
but the Minister of
Culture and Fine Arts

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:24.020
herself wrote me
an email saying,

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:29.730
thank you so much for wanting
to support this important

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:32.524
find that you made
of the first zero.

00:32:32.524 --> 00:32:34.440
And we'll place it in a
museum and everything.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.880
So I'm in the process
of going to Cambodia

00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:43.450
and trying to arrange-- I
haven't seen it yet, though.

00:32:43.450 --> 00:32:45.820
So I'm not sure that
it hasn't been stolen.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:49.630
You always have this fear
in the back of your mind.

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:52.140
Maybe they're saying yes, yes,
because they want the money.

00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:54.265
But they haven't talked
about this for a long time.

00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:56.470
And maybe the Sicilian
archaeologists

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:59.630
did spirit it out
of the country.

00:32:59.630 --> 00:33:03.520
I wondered how a piece of stone
like that weighing a few tons

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:05.050
can be taken out of Cambodia.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:07.790
But the art dealers
told me, no problem.

00:33:07.790 --> 00:33:11.170
They just put it on a crate, the
crate, they put it on a ship,

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.490
and it's gone.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:13.160
Who knows?

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.060
But they promised me that
they have it under control,

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.730
and as soon as
they get the money,

00:33:17.730 --> 00:33:20.710
they'll place it in a museum.

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.890
So I think it's
important because there's

00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.230
one thing you read in
a book or in an article

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:31.200
about some kind of a discovery,
or an artifact, and it's gone.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.670
That's not the same.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:39.040
When you are able to see it
and touch it, it's in a museum,

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.120
and study it further, then
that is, I think, of value.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:47.760
And I even found a place
in a museum, the National

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:49.980
Cambodian Museum in Phnom
Penh, where it should go.

00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:52.690
There's a little room
in the corner of it.

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:56.710
It's sort of a square
display like that that's

00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:58.310
dedicated to the
seventh century.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.940
And that's where it should go.

00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:01.970
And there's some art
from Sambor in Mekong,

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.820
where this comes from.

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:07.440
So that's the end of the
story at this minute.

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:08.949
Thank you very much.

00:34:08.949 --> 00:34:11.440
If you have any
questions, I'll be--

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.121
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:13.121 --> 00:34:15.120
AMIR ACZEL: I'll be glad
to try and answer them.

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:19.350
Yes?

00:34:19.350 --> 00:34:22.830
AUDIENCE: So as you
mentioned, the importance

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.050
of zeroes for place
value, and I guess

00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:31.960
just a little more context,
someone reading this stele,

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.590
were they already familiar
with the idea of place value,

00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:37.620
but had just never
seen a numeral yet

00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.989
that had a zero in
the middle of it?

00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:45.070
Or is place value
itself a novel thing

00:34:45.070 --> 00:34:48.260
as of the writing of this
that the reader would

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:53.055
have had to have some education
or training to expect?

00:34:53.055 --> 00:34:53.929
Does that make sense?

00:34:53.929 --> 00:34:54.595
AMIR ACZEL: Yes.

00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:01.140
I worked as a statistician
for many years.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:04.080
And one of the problems
we do with estimation

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:10.060
is suppose you want to estimate
the left point of support

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.040
of a distribution.

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.220
So the minimum point.

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:19.190
And so you use the
smallest order statistic.

00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:22.020
If you look at data, that's
the last one towards the left.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.290
But there's always bias.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:26.210
If you know about bias,
this is a biased estimator.

00:35:26.210 --> 00:35:32.610
It's always biased because you
can't-- this is the smallest

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:34.390
value you could have.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:36.770
You can't always-- if it's
a continuous distribution,

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:38.790
probability of 0 of
hitting it exactly.

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:42.800
So we don't know
how early this is.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:44.760
So we have to see it in context.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:51.150
So my guess is because of that
bias inherent in an estimation,

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.580
this is a kind of an
estimation process.

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:58.600
You dig up new steles and
new archaeological things.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.370
And each one of them
is a data point.

00:36:00.370 --> 00:36:02.530
So the Gwalior one
in India is one.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:04.650
And then, you go
200 years earlier.

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:10.810
In the last 80 years, nobody has
found anything older than this.

00:36:10.810 --> 00:36:12.710
So we don't know.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.280
But seeing it in
context, you may

00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.360
imagine maybe this or an
earlier piece of stone

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.670
like that, maybe 200
years earlier than that,

00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:24.070
where somebody has this idea.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:26.130
I need to write the year 605.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.380
So the Babylonians
just left a blank.

00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.840
They had a very sophisticated
number system based on 60.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.010
So you'd have the 0 power
would be the units, the same as

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:37.510
for us.

00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:40.440
And the power one for us
would be the tens for them.

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.540
It's 60s, right?

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:44.760
So two 60s or three 60s,
like we have 30 or 20?

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.740
And then the next
power would be 3,600.

00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.190
That was a huge base,
and therefore it

00:36:50.190 --> 00:36:51.840
was not as efficient.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.410
But they didn't have a zero.

00:36:53.410 --> 00:36:54.880
But they'd leave a blank.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:58.220
So one can imagine
that maybe when

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:02.880
they wanted to write 505, 100
years earlier, the year 505

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:07.400
of the Caka era, they'd write 5
and leave a blank, or just 55,

00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:11.300
and sometimes when somebody
sees it, he or she will say,

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.370
well, it has to be 505
because we know it's not 55.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:18.300
And that's what the
Babylonians did.

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.010
The example with
the Babylonians,

00:37:20.010 --> 00:37:21.680
they used things in context.

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:25.370
Like you say, in
a modern example,

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.780
say something costs $6.95.

00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.710
We're talking about a magazine.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.710
It would be $6.95.

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:35.320
If I said $695 for an airline
ticket, you know it's $695.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:39.630
So that's-- the way I understand
it-- what the Babylonians did.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:40.850
There was a blank sometimes.

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.391
There was a blank, and you could
understand from the context.

00:37:43.391 --> 00:37:47.110
At some point, some
person, then or earlier,

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:54.030
decided to chisel a dot there
to say the 6 is for hundreds

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:57.270
and the 5 is for units, and
there's nothing for the 10s.

00:37:57.270 --> 00:38:00.257
So that's my guess.

00:38:00.257 --> 00:38:01.590
I hope I answered your question.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:08.752
AUDIENCE: I just visited
Chichen Itza a couple weeks ago,

00:38:08.752 --> 00:38:10.710
and I'm totally impressed
by the Mayan culture.

00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:13.320
But did you have a
date on the Mayan zero?

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.590
AMIR ACZEL: I think it's 37.

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:15.320
AUDIENCE: 37?

00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:17.760
AMIR ACZEL: Yeah, AD
37, just from memory.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:19.330
But I know very little about it.

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:20.260
Something like that.

00:38:20.260 --> 00:38:23.340
The number 37 pops into mind.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:26.845
So I think it's 37.

00:38:26.845 --> 00:38:29.470
AUDIENCE: So thank you for your
previous answer about the place

00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:31.820
value represented by the blank.

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.117
How far back does that go?

00:38:33.117 --> 00:38:34.700
AMIR ACZEL: How far
back does that go?

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.770
Well, the Babylonian
culture is very old.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:40.590
So 2000 BC, something like that.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:46.940
So Plimpton 322, the
famous clay tablet at Yale,

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:52.380
is 1650 something
like that BC, BCE

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:55.350
depending on how
you want to call it.

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.960
So it's something
like 3,600 years.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:01.210
AUDIENCE: The concept of
zero goes back to then, then.

00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:03.030
It's just the symbol of zero?

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.780
AMIR ACZEL: Right.

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:05.397
I think so.

00:39:05.397 --> 00:39:06.230
That's a good point.

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:11.230
Maybe the Babylonians didn't
need the Buddhist void.

00:39:11.230 --> 00:39:13.770
The Buddha was born much later.

00:39:13.770 --> 00:39:16.790
There goes my theory.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:17.290
Good point.

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:18.748
AUDIENCE: The other
question is you

00:39:18.748 --> 00:39:22.320
were talking about
things like 695.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:27.060
Do we know where the
final zero was first used?

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.150
So this is not a medial zero.

00:39:31.844 --> 00:39:33.760
It's possible that it
was not contemporaneous.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.205
I don't know.

00:39:35.205 --> 00:39:36.580
AMIR ACZEL: A year
later, there's

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.120
a zero from Panin
Bank in Indonesia,

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:42.230
a stele that you can
still see in a museum

00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:44.550
there in Panin Bank.

00:39:44.550 --> 00:39:46.060
And it is a circle.

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:48.700
So they co-existed apparently.

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:52.300
The oldest one is a dot, but--

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.340
AUDIENCE: What I meant
was it's possible

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:59.000
that you might write
605 as 6, 0, 5,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.590
but you write 600 as just 6.

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:04.390
So when is the first
evidence that you

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:07.007
have a zero at the
end of a number?

00:40:07.007 --> 00:40:08.340
AMIR ACZEL: That's a good point.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.839
AUDIENCE: Is that
a different issue?

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:10.400
I don't know.

00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.050
Maybe it happened at the
same time, maybe it didn't.

00:40:12.050 --> 00:40:12.620
I don't know.

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:13.370
AMIR ACZEL: Right.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.810
I see what you're saying, right.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:16.910
I don't know.

00:40:16.910 --> 00:40:18.934
I have no answer to that.

00:40:18.934 --> 00:40:20.260
Sorry.

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.220
AUDIENCE: If I
understand correctly,

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.370
you dated this to 683
because of the text 605.

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:30.500
But do you have evidence that
that text wasn't written years

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:31.550
later?

00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:34.450
AMIR ACZEL: Right, so
that's a very good question.

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:37.780
The temple there was
built around that time.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.610
Around 683, and we know
that from stylistic forms

00:40:44.610 --> 00:40:50.220
on the door frames, lintels,
and all these things there.

00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:53.800
So that site was
studied extensively

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.880
by Coedes and by others.

00:40:55.880 --> 00:40:57.560
So we know when it was built.

00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.770
So for example, yeah,
that's how you know.

00:41:00.770 --> 00:41:03.790
So we know when the
temple was built.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:11.160
So maybe it's-- well, 683,
they wouldn't write it before

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:13.434
because they were actually
describing an event that

00:41:13.434 --> 00:41:14.350
happened at that time.

00:41:14.350 --> 00:41:17.050
They were saying, the era
began on the fifth day

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:17.990
of the waning moon.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:21.990
It seems like something
that's localized in time.

00:41:21.990 --> 00:41:27.860
Unless, hm, could you write
it at a different time,

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:31.230
year 605 of the Caka era began
on the fifth day of the waning

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.730
moon?

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.470
Maybe they're talking like we
would be reading the Bible.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:37.880
Something happened on a
certain-- yeah, it could be.

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:40.160
But the temple was
built around that time.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.890
It's a seventh century temple.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:43.840
The styles are seventh century.

00:41:43.840 --> 00:41:45.430
And Hab Touch
himself is actually

00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:49.000
an expert on Cambodian art.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.690
And he actually has classified
the Cambodian art styles

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.810
into five different styles.

00:41:54.810 --> 00:41:59.390
And the style of Sambor-- there
are two Sambors, by the way.

00:41:59.390 --> 00:42:00.950
And for several
months, I was going

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:04.580
to the wrong Sambor trying
to look for it years before.

00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:09.380
There's a Sambor that's near
Siem Reap, where Angkor Wat is.

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:11.600
And this Sambor is all
the way on the other side.

00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:14.630
This is northeast of Phnom Penh.

00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:16.599
And the other one is northwest.

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:17.890
But they're both called Sambor.

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:20.840
One is Sambor something
else, and this

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:22.740
is Sambor on the Mekong.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.460
The other one is Sambor Prei
Kuk, and this is Sambor Mekong.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.280
And they're both
seventh century.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:29.990
So the style is very well known.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.860
The artistic style
of everything,

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.621
so we know it's seventh century.

00:42:33.621 --> 00:42:34.454
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:42:34.454 --> 00:42:36.791
AMIR ACZEL: Sure.

00:42:36.791 --> 00:42:39.290
AUDIENCE: I had originally had
the same question about this,

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.319
and that other inscription
in India, right?

00:42:41.319 --> 00:42:43.110
How do you know somebody
didn't scribble it

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.490
into the temple
walls later, right?

00:42:45.490 --> 00:42:51.460
But the other question I had
was is there any use of it

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:56.100
in arithmetic at some
point in old Khmer?

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:01.630
AMIR ACZEL: We don't know.

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:04.080
In terms of the old Khmer,
this is all we have.

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.940
So we have no knowledge
about their arithmetic.

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.987
It would be very
interesting to find out.

00:43:10.987 --> 00:43:11.820
This is all we have.

00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:14.940
That's just one number.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.880
Well, we know some things, which
are actually very interesting.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.182
So Coedes was an amazing guy.

00:43:20.182 --> 00:43:21.557
He wasn't a
mathematician at all,

00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:23.580
but he was fascinated
by mathematics.

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:27.420
I don't remember the
exact way it works.

00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:34.440
But numbers in the east
were often given names.

00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.330
So you'd say, the veda,
and there are four vedas.

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:38.850
So the number four is veda.

00:43:38.850 --> 00:43:41.530
You say veda, it means four.

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.860
Eyes means two, obviously.

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:48.490
And census, I think, is
five, or something like that.

00:43:48.490 --> 00:43:50.501
And flavors is six.

00:43:50.501 --> 00:43:51.500
I may be confusing them.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:57.660
But every number of the
first few numbers has a word.

00:43:57.660 --> 00:43:59.200
And it's like a code.

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.820
And you'd say, I'll
meet you at-- I

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:07.450
don't know-- a particular
street, veda eyes census,

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:09.150
and you know
exactly where it is.

00:44:09.150 --> 00:44:12.830
And he traces that, how they
do arithmetic with that.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:18.440
That would be a good question,
whether eyes plus eyes

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.740
would be whatever four is.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.530
Well, veda.

00:44:20.530 --> 00:44:22.640
Veda is eyes plus
eyes, or eyes square.

00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.490
So I don't know if they
did arithmetic that way.

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:28.580
Coedes started and
made a lot of progress.

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.354
But it stopped.

00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:30.020
We know nothing.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.440
There are thousands
of steles in Cambodia.

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:37.540
You go to museums, and they
have them in their store rooms.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.700
And he was a genius.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.020
He was just able to translate.

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.390
He did 2,000 of them.

00:44:42.390 --> 00:44:43.010
And that's it.

00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:44.290
Nobody knows.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:50.190
Nobody has consistently
studied these further.

00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:50.890
Why?

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:51.690
I have no idea.

00:44:51.690 --> 00:44:54.230
Maybe they just
have no resources.

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:55.840
I guess I do know why.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.840
You don't want to
justify colonialism.

00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:04.894
But France says resources, and
Coedes wasn't just by himself.

00:45:04.894 --> 00:45:08.190
The was the Ecole
Francais d'Extreme Orient,

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:13.800
which is the French School
of the Far East, I guess,

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:16.070
the extreme Orient.

00:45:16.070 --> 00:45:21.830
And they had a lot of money,
and they could do things.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.500
That's why they
were able to do it.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.020
Now, the Cambodians
go to Palermo

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:28.640
to get somebody to teach them
how to restore artifacts.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.250
So I think that's
where the problem lies.

00:45:31.250 --> 00:45:32.950
Somebody needs
to-- there are tons

00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:34.950
of these things that
need to be translated.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:38.270
This is one of only
2,000, 3,000 inscriptions

00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:39.650
that have been translated.

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:41.810
And there are
probably-- well, I don't

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:43.310
know how many there
are in Cambodia.

00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:45.109
In India, there are millions.

00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:46.650
And they still need
to be translated.

00:45:46.650 --> 00:45:49.300
The problem with the
dating, again, a few of you

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.070
alluded to is how do we
know that it's the date?

00:45:52.070 --> 00:45:53.510
That's a huge problem in India.

00:45:53.510 --> 00:45:57.010
So in India, the dates
are very, very murky.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:02.110
And the reason is that many
of the inscriptions in India

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.820
are on copper plates.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.020
And the date is always on the
side, or often on the side.

00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:12.010
And you don't know if it was
added five centuries later

00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.030
or whatever.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:15.890
So the dates are very fishy.

00:46:15.890 --> 00:46:19.260
And that allows somebody
like Raju to claim,

00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:20.930
we invented everything.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:24.730
On the other hand, they probably
did have a lot of science,

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:27.780
astronomy in particular,
and a lot of mathematics

00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:28.777
that they did develop.

00:46:28.777 --> 00:46:29.610
But it's all hidden.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:31.370
Nobody has translated
these things.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:35.400
And nobody knows the
dates with precision.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:38.360
Here, we are lucky.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.220
The good thing is
that it's in stone.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:44.360
It looks like it
hasn't been-- doesn't

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:47.350
look to me like somebody
could have come in 1932

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:49.900
and chiseled that 605.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.260
There are forgeries.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.810
I studied one of them,
a very interesting one.

00:46:54.810 --> 00:46:59.380
Maybe you know that story about
the Drake Plate in California.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.830
Many years-- it was discovered
by a Professor at Berkeley.

00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:04.430
And it was in the trunk of
his car for several years.

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:07.200
And this is Francis
Drake put this plate here

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:11.530
on the California coast,
commemorating his arrival there

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:13.920
by Point Reyes Peninsula.

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.270
And they found it was fake.

00:47:15.270 --> 00:47:19.330
The copper was made
using modern techniques.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:23.490
And the script wasn't
Elizabethan at all.

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:24.880
It was forgery.

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.100
So there are forgeries.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:29.110
There are lots of people
who have an incentive

00:47:29.110 --> 00:47:30.680
to forge things.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:33.390
And so this, you never know.

00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:34.750
I don't think this is fake.

00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:38.670
And the cool thing is
that we have that date.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:40.360
And it happens to have a zero.

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.650
And the same, in India,
the Gwalior zero is 270.

00:47:44.650 --> 00:47:46.840
And it looks just
like our numerals,

00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:49.510
even though it's ninth century.

00:47:49.510 --> 00:47:51.250
The two looks like that.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.160
It's a very overdone two.

00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.340
And the zero is a circle.

00:47:55.340 --> 00:48:00.130
I'm sorry, the seven
actually goes back very far.

00:48:00.130 --> 00:48:02.630
The seven is one of
the first numerals that

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:08.290
remained the same from its
inception, whatever that means.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.610
I've looked at a lot of
these scripts in India.

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:15.900
There's Brahmi
numerals, and Ashoka

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.350
was a Buddhist king in
India, first few centuries.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:22.350
And he had pillars
all over India-- maybe

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:24.130
you know-- they're
very famous pillars.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:26.130
And there are numerals
on them, and the numerals

00:48:26.130 --> 00:48:27.706
are called Ashoka numerals.

00:48:27.706 --> 00:48:29.080
Both Ashoka
numerals, and there's

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:35.650
a Naneghat cave in the Western
Ghats, southeast of Mumbai.

00:48:35.650 --> 00:48:36.660
And you can go up there.

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.070
It's a long hike to the top.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.399
There are numerals there called
the Naneghat inscription.

00:48:41.399 --> 00:48:42.940
So there are these
three scripts that

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.556
go back the first few centuries,
two, three centuries AD.

00:48:46.556 --> 00:48:47.930
They're all around
the same time.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:49.850
I think Ashoka is about
the third century,

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.340
or maybe it's 300 or so.

00:48:51.340 --> 00:48:55.310
So all three of them have a
seven that's just like ours,

00:48:55.310 --> 00:48:59.040
without the-- just a
seven the way we write it,

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.850
not the way European
write it, crossing it.

00:49:01.850 --> 00:49:07.260
So the seven is one of the first
numerals that just traveled

00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:10.920
through time to us
exactly as it is.

00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:12.970
So you have the
seven, and then you

00:49:12.970 --> 00:49:15.740
have a zero in India,
the Gwalior zero.

00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:17.240
Now, there's another
way-- there are

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.710
many ways of dating things
that can authenticate them

00:49:20.710 --> 00:49:21.944
quite well.

00:49:21.944 --> 00:49:23.360
I'll get to you
in a second-- that

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.670
can authenticate
them quite well.

00:49:25.670 --> 00:49:26.840
This is one example.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:32.820
It's not unique,
but it's very clear.

00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:33.620
You have a date.

00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.440
It has a zero in it.

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:38.050
And you know when
that dynasty started.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:42.650
That dynasty started in
78, so we know the date.

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:44.440
When you go earlier
in history, there's

00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:46.670
something very interesting
that can be done,

00:49:46.670 --> 00:49:50.530
and that is early civilizations
like the Babylonians were

00:49:50.530 --> 00:49:53.440
very careful in recording
total solar eclipses.

00:49:53.440 --> 00:50:00.580
They were very obsessed with
Venus and not the phases,

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.890
they couldn't see them,
but the motions of Venus

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:07.580
when it rises with
the sun and so on.

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:11.780
And they also were interested
in total solar eclipses.

00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.220
So they tell you
something happened.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:17.910
The king died, whatever
king died on the day of,

00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:20.920
or five days after the
total solar eclipse.

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:24.040
You can find it exactly because
you use modern astronomy.

00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.010
You go back in time
roughly, and you

00:50:26.010 --> 00:50:30.370
know where the eclipse
path past on a certain time

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:32.480
on a certain day
in a certain year.

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.230
And that has been
used, actually,

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:38.430
to establish a lot of Assyrian,
Babylonian chronology.

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:40.630
So that's another very
nice modern method.

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:44.550
And of course,
radiocarbon is unbeatable.

00:50:44.550 --> 00:50:48.270
I've worked a little,
devised a statistical routine

00:50:48.270 --> 00:50:52.690
for making radiocarbon more
precise using the bootstrap.

00:50:52.690 --> 00:50:55.460
And the radiocarbon
is now, I don't know,

00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.760
50 years or within
a few centuries.

00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.450
So it's very accurate.

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.380
AUDIENCE: Would you speak to the
difference between the numeral

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:05.340
zero and the number zero?

00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:08.350
In particular, I'm
thinking imagining

00:51:08.350 --> 00:51:10.750
a record of an
inventory that might

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:14.740
say, number of bushels
of wheat, zero.

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:18.300
Number of jars of
wine, zero, which

00:51:18.300 --> 00:51:22.560
is distinct from the use of
the numeral as a placeholder.

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:26.280
But the numeral to
represent the number zero.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.030
AMIR ACZEL: Right.

00:51:27.030 --> 00:51:32.320
So the way I understand it, that
is a sophisticated idea, too.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:36.380
In the west, at least, it was
difficult for people to say,

00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:40.590
we have zero
bottles of wine left

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.020
for the holiday, or
something like that.

00:51:44.020 --> 00:51:51.240
And my understanding is that the
double-- what do you call it?

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:56.420
The bookkeeping method,
double entry bookkeeping

00:51:56.420 --> 00:52:02.310
evolved because of that
inability to say there's zero.

00:52:02.310 --> 00:52:05.250
So you have numbers
of one kind here

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:06.940
and numbers of the
other kind there.

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.570
What you owe, what you
are owed, and so on.

00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:17.310
Yeah, it takes a little
sophistication to say,

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:20.720
we have zero of something.

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.530
Negative numbers are even worse.

00:52:22.530 --> 00:52:24.470
What do negative numbers mean?

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:26.890
So when you study mathematics
and you look at the numbers,

00:52:26.890 --> 00:52:30.750
how they evolved, the idea of
numbers, how we perceive them,

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.796
the positive, the natural
numbers and natural to us.

00:52:33.796 --> 00:52:36.295
One, two, three, four, five,
even if they go on to infinity.

00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:43.120
In order to define the negative
numbers, you need a zero.

00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.250
Because the zero is
the point of symmetry

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:49.270
where the natural numbers
go to the right, and then

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:50.680
the negative ones
go to the left.

00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.310
And you can have a
group under addition

00:52:56.310 --> 00:52:59.100
where you have the inverse
is the minute you have

00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:01.020
the negative numbers,
and you have a zero.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:04.210
So the zero is the
additive identity.

00:53:04.210 --> 00:53:06.520
The multiplicative
identity would be one.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.630
So then you can have a field.

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:13.180
So yes, it's a
sophisticated idea.

00:53:13.180 --> 00:53:15.770
It was slow in the west.

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:17.290
I don't know, in
the east, it seems

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:21.110
to have been more
natural, maybe.

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.910
I feel, and I have no
strong proof of that,

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:30.780
and infinity also is an
idea that was maybe easier

00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:33.630
to evolve in the east, just
having read a lot of stuff

00:53:33.630 --> 00:53:35.970
about the east.

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:41.050
In Hinduism, there's an
infinite sea, and the sea turtle

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:47.850
on which Vishnu lies when
Brahma springs out of his navel.

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:50.250
It's called Ananta,
which means infinity.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.140
So there are ideas of infinity.

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.520
They didn't understand them.

00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.510
But they could talk about them
maybe more than in the west.

00:53:57.510 --> 00:54:00.370
Because Augustine writes
about the infinitude of God

00:54:00.370 --> 00:54:01.990
in certain ways.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:03.640
So infinity as well-- yeah?

00:54:07.410 --> 00:54:12.060
AUDIENCE: In the system
where the designation is just

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:19.400
a blank space, like 60 is 6,
or 601 is 6, blank space, 1,

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:23.280
how would you judge when
there's more than one space?

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.310
And if there's more than
one, is it two or three?

00:54:27.310 --> 00:54:30.160
In order to really do
that with any accuracy,

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:35.510
you need something in there,
a little jot of some kind.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:37.840
AUDIENCE: Or it could
be clear columns.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:39.482
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:54:39.482 --> 00:54:40.940
AMIR ACZEL: Good
point, good point.

00:54:40.940 --> 00:54:43.532
That's why the zero
is so important.

00:54:43.532 --> 00:54:45.240
You don't know how
many blanks are there.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.820
And the blanks
also, remember, they

00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:49.310
didn't have anything
standardized

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:55.350
like you'd print on a page,
and a blank is an exact width.

00:54:55.350 --> 00:54:57.206
This was written by
hand, or chiseled.

00:54:57.206 --> 00:54:59.080
And how do you know if
there's a blank there,

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:03.430
or just the guy couldn't
judge distances very well?

00:55:03.430 --> 00:55:05.560
Especially if the
distances vary,

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.560
there's no way to tell where
there's a blank unless it's

00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:11.220
really a significant width.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.300
So that's a good point.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:14.580
But you could-- going back
to your previous question,

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:18.960
you could assume-- and
what somebody else asked,

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:24.750
too, and commented on-- a
blank could be quite rationally

00:55:24.750 --> 00:55:26.400
a void.

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.910
And maybe it's
not that Buddhist.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:32.870
Maybe it's an idea
that came other ways.

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:34.680
Going back to infinity,
infinity really

00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:40.270
was understood with the work of
Cantor in the 1800s in Germany.

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:45.300
So infinity really becomes
a mathematical concept

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.180
in the late 1800s.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.490
But maybe what I'm
trying to say is

00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:52.100
that eastern people
talked more about infinity

00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:53.630
than people in the west.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:55.520
Yeah?

00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.740
AUDIENCE: Just on the subject
of multiple zeroes in a row,

00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:05.170
I'm trying to remember
the tables of chords

00:56:05.170 --> 00:56:09.180
in Ptolemy's Almagest, which
is second century AD, right?

00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.510
Which has trigonometric
functions of every half degree

00:56:13.510 --> 00:56:16.104
value between 0 and
whatever they went up to,

00:56:16.104 --> 00:56:17.520
30 degrees or
something like that,

00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.961
for trigonometric calculations.

00:56:18.961 --> 00:56:20.460
There's calculations
in the Almagest

00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:24.572
that certainly go out to like
five places in sexidecimal

00:56:24.572 --> 00:56:25.530
or something like that.

00:56:25.530 --> 00:56:27.460
So certainly, there
must been calculations

00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.080
that they were doing
at that time, all

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:32.700
the trigonometric calculations
that they were doing

00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:34.617
that involved multiple
zeroes in a row.

00:56:34.617 --> 00:56:36.450
It seems very unlikely
that they would never

00:56:36.450 --> 00:56:40.780
have hit two adjacent base
60 slots that were empty.

00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.820
But of course, all
their calculations

00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:45.760
were done in very strict
tables, these tables

00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.955
of values of the
chord function had

00:56:48.955 --> 00:56:51.330
the firsts, and the seconds,
and thirds, and the fourths,

00:56:51.330 --> 00:56:54.282
and the fifths, which are
fractional powers of 60,

00:56:54.282 --> 00:56:55.490
all lined up with each other.

00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:58.859
So I don't know how Ptolemy
actually wrote it, though.

00:56:58.859 --> 00:56:59.900
AMIR ACZEL: You're right.

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:01.651
If you're careful
with writing a table

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.650
and there are five zeroes
that have to be there,

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:07.020
so there are five blank columns,
or whatever, however they

00:57:07.020 --> 00:57:07.520
did it.

00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:08.490
That makes sense.

00:57:08.490 --> 00:57:08.990
Yes.

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:10.730
So they must have
had a technology.

00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:12.690
So maybe ours is
more advanced just

00:57:12.690 --> 00:57:13.990
in the sense it's standardized.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:15.406
You have a zero,
so you don't have

00:57:15.406 --> 00:57:18.720
to worry about making
a table and columns.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.280
So the ideas must have
been there early on.

00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:27.070
But maybe they don't agree
with our sense of neatness

00:57:27.070 --> 00:57:30.020
and keeping things
much more universal.

00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.400
So you can write a number
here and read it in Japan,

00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:38.020
and it makes sense that it's
1,005 and not something else.

00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.320
So good point, good point.

00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:44.901
They did have very
extensive tables, right?

00:57:44.901 --> 00:57:45.400
Good.

00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:47.840
Any other questions?

00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:51.150
Well, thank you very much
for having me come here.

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:53.600
