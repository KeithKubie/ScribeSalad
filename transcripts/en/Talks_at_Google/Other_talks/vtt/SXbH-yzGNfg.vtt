DESTON BENNETT: Thanks
for coming out today.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.150
Again, my name's
Deston Bennett.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.780
I'm with the Grammy producers
and engineers wing.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.760
The Grammy Awards, as many of
you may know, are the only

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.770
music awards that are peer
determined, meaning it's not

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.560
the public that votes.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.690
Those who vote are members of
the Recording Academy, and who

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.500
are hands-on music creators--

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.100
artists, songwriters,
musicians,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:23.900
producers, and engineers.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.770
From the very beginning at our
founding in 1956, the basis

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.810
for the Grammy Awards process
has been a commitment to

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:29.510
excellence.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.090
The Recording Academy's original
credo clearly states

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.720
that the awards are not about
sales, and they're not about

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.710
popularity.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.600
Musical excellence in all areas
is the only criteria

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.890
Grammy voters are charged with
to determine who gets

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.300
nominated, and what will win.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.880
Knowing that little bit of
information should help you

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.870
whenever there's some
controversy about the Grammys,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.740
as there sometimes can be.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.020
For example, the year jazz
bassist Esperanza Spalding won

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.050
the Best New Artist category
against fellow nominees Drake,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.990
Florence and the Machine,
Mumford and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.200
Sons, and Justin Bieber.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.300
She won because the majority
of the Grammy voters were

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.580
familiar with Esperanza and her
work, and they saw her as

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.835
a stand-out that year.

00:01:06.835 --> 00:01:09.420
It's pretty cool when
you think about it.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.520
Many of you who are musicians
or audio producers or

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.210
engineers may be eligible to
be members of the Academy.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.140
And I'm happy to speak to you
about that after this is over

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.900
if you like.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:21.230
You can also get some more
information or join by

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.660
visiting Grammy365.com.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.430
Today specifically, we're here
to talk about excellence in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.990
sound, something that's key
to great recordings.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.760
The P&amp;E wing has partnered with
the Consumer Electronics

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.660
Association and others on an
initiative we call Quality

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.990
Sound Matters.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.960
We represent people who truly
understand the difference good

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.140
sound makes, and we want to
share their enthusiasm and

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.980
excitement about quality
with everybody.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.650
Today, we have a very cool
presentation from

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.850
Grammy-winning engineer that
we think you'll enjoy.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.020
And I want to give a big thank
you to Neil Annala and Joe

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.230
Rosenberg for bringing
us here today.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.850
We'd also like to thank JBL
and Prism Sound for this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.120
amazing sound system you're
going to hear today, too.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.890
The speakers in particular, they
encompass some very new,

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.970
exciting technology that
you're amongst

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.729
the first to hear.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.390
And to top it off, I really want
to introduce an amazing

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.650
engineer producer who's worked
with artists including

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.660
Metallica, Lincoln Park,
Green Day, and U2,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.020
along with last week's--

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.510
well, not last week, but a
recent number one album, the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.980
Black Sabbath project.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.340
He's a two-time Grammy winner
for his work on the Red Hot

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.890
Chili Peppers' "Stadium
Arcadium" project, as well as

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.580
Adele's "21" album.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.040
He has another interesting
honor.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.770
In 2012, he was named the
International Engineer of the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.240
Year by England's Music
Producers Guild.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.072
Please welcome Andrew Scheps.

00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:44.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.590
ANDREW SCHEPS: First of all,
thanks for coming.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.780
This is as full a house as we
could have in here, I think.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.300
So thank you so much, and thanks
again to Neil and Joe

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.160
for putting this together.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.240
This is awesome.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.320
So later on, we're going to
listen to a bunch of stuff,

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.240
which is the point
of what I do.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.830
And the Recording Academy has
been really great about

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.990
sponsoring me to do this talk
all over the country.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.410
The idea of the talk, it was
originally put together for

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.290
what the Recording Academy
called their Grammy Future Now

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.830
conference, which was sort a
mini, one-day TED conference

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.010
for producers and engineers, for
people who make music in

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.780
Los Angeles.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.560
And since then, I've gone around
the country, and most

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.820
the time I give this
presentation to

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.430
producers and engineers.

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.660
And it's because there's a
lot of information in the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.880
presentation that, as people who
make records, we sort of

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.630
kind of know, but we don't
actually know.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.810
And so I'm trying to put numbers
and facts behind the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.280
things we think we know so that
when we listen, you can

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.020
actually compare things and
you know what it is you're

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.260
listening to, and why there
might be differences and

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.180
things like that.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.140
So I'll start the way I usually
start by asking how

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.110
many people in this room are
artists and make records, or

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.660
have ever released a record.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.710
So still good number of you.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:00.930
So if you've released a record,
how many of you have

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.300
then gone and bought your record
to make sure that what

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.540
comes off the services sounds
like what you sent them?

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.220
So that's about normal.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.380
About a third of the
hands, maybe less.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.589
And that's exactly the same
with people who do that as

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.630
their day job-- or night
job, depending on

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.130
the hours your keep.

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.170
It's not something people
really think about.

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.460
They finish their record, they
master it, like oh, it's done.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.160
Send it off, and you're done.

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.030
And of course, now with all
the digital services--

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.930
and we'll get into lots
of them specifically--

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.190
and there are a few that happen
to be housed in this

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.260
building or down
in San Bruno--

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.060
there are lots and lots of
different ways that music gets

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.380
out into the world.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.060
And so, the idea is to give some
context to know, what are

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.090
all these possibilities?

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.840
How do they compare?

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.400
And do they actually impact the
consumer's experience when

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.910
they listen to your music?

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.240
So that's the idea.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.990
Now along the way, I can usually
get away with a lot of

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.820
sort of vagaries, because
I'm talking to

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.370
producers and engineers.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.540
All right, this is the question
just for you guys.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.700
How many people in this room
know more about digital audio

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.700
theory than me?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.370
There's going to be-- come on.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.780
It's everybody in the room.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.270
But seriously, how many people
work directly with digital

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.070
audio in the room?

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.650
OK, I'm going to be vague.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.690
I'm going to be slightly
inaccurate, and I would

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.890
welcome corrections
along the way.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.800
So I've done the presentation,
I think, 12 times now.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.300
11 of those times were for
producers and engineers, and

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.250
once was a few weeks ago, which
is when Neil came and

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.700
saw me at Fantasy Studios
in Berkeley.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.270
And that was for a room full
of people from the tech

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.590
community, including people from
Google and YouTube and

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:48.260
Google Play music, as well as
SoundCloud and Apple and

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.890
Rhapsody and Arteo, and a
few other companies, and

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.340
Fraunhofer, who developed
the MP3 and ADC codecs.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.650
And I got my butt kicked.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:57.940
And I'm fine with that.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.920
I would love to get my butt
kicked, because every time I

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.330
give this presentation, I know
more, and I can kick butt back

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.660
a little bit, which
is the point.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.340
And I think what happens is
people get into their little

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.930
rabbit holes on what
they work on.

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:13.980
So I make records, and I want
to make great sounding

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.120
records, but I don't want to
follow it through the food

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.000
chain down to the consumer,
because that's not what I do.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.890
Now two years ago, I started
my own record label, so now

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:23.500
that became part of what I do.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.480
And I used to think, I'm going
to start a label because the

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.090
labels suck.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:28.000
They don't know what
they're doing.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.760
It turns out I don't know what
I'm doing, and it's really,

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:32.930
really difficult, and
there's a lot to it.

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.060
So every part of this process
of getting music into the

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.570
hands of people who listen to it
is unbelievably difficult,

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.160
incredibly technical, and
fraught with peril for the

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.130
audio along the way.

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:46.130
So we'll talk about some
of the specifics.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.950
So what I want to do first,
though, is put recording into

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.530
perspective, OK?

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.550
So for thousands and thousands
of years-- and now we start my

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.500
very fine PowerPoint--

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:58.960
there has been music.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.190
OK, for who knows how many?

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:02.005
Let's say 10,000?

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.310
Is that a good number?

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:04.770
This is where I get vague,
and everybody in the

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:05.530
room backs me up.

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.300
So we're going to say 10,000
years, there's been music in

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.490
the form of songs that have
been written by somebody.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:18.280
And then, they would perform
their song for somebody in

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.140
their village or something
like that.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.420
And the only way music could
propagate would be either they

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.740
would go to the next village, or
they would teach their song

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.520
to somebody and then they would
go to the next village,

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.670
or people from the next village
would come hear them

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.680
and go back.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:29.990
Right?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.400
So there's your music industry
for the first 9,900 years.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.400
Fair enough?

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.040
OK, about 100 years ago--
a little bit more-- but

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.160
basically, about 100 years
ago, there started to be

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.090
consumer recordings of audio.

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:46.420
And there were a few things
before this, but let's say the

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:49.700
wax cylinder was the first
viable format.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.360
So you have the Edison cylinder
where people would

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.770
come into a room.

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:55.530
They would make lots of noise.

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.990
That noise gets collected
by a horn.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.870
It would get scratched
on to this disc

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.280
that's spinning around.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.060
And then, you could take
that disc, and go

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.240
play it back elsewhere.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.470
So all of a sudden,
you have created

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.810
what is called recording.

00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:11.160
Recording, especially back then,
was technically just at

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.300
a delay process, right?

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.950
So you perform the music, and
then you capture it for a

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.070
second, and then you can
carry it around.

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:21.630
And then later on at any point,
you can play it back.

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:25.460
So now, you can get rid of some
of the space and time

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:29.520
constraints of everybody
come to your concert.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.380
Now you can record your concert
and send it out.

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:33.679
Now this caused a huge uproar.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.120
And in researching this for this
presentation, and also I

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:38.365
teach a recording class where I
try to give a little bit of

00:08:38.365 --> 00:08:41.559
a history, there's some amazing
quotes from John

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.940
Philip Sousa and people like
that about how recording was

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:48.670
going to destroy not
music, but society.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:49.610
Destroy it.

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:52.030
You have to be in the room
with the musician.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:54.380
So I think we've all kind
of gotten over that.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:57.080
I mean, I would hope everybody
here enjoys going to concerts

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.750
and things like that.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:00.220
But we've gotten over the fact
that we're going to completely

00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:01.630
destroy society.

00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:04.060
Music isn't the only thing
that's destroyed.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:05.750
And it's just one
of many things.

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.530
OK, so that's 100 years.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:08.680
That's it.

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.270
Then about 50 years ago, mainly
with technology out of

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:16.230
Germany in the '40s, and then
also some techniques developed

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:19.070
bouncing from one tape machine
to another tape machine, you

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:22.150
started to be able to not just
capture a live performance,

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.280
but you had what we call
overdubs, which is basically,

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.510
you make a recording, and then
you record some more stuff to

00:09:28.510 --> 00:09:29.240
go with it.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.490
So now, you can record at
different times, and all of

00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.140
those things up to
make a recording.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.690
A lot of the early Beatles
recordings

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.290
were examples of bouncing.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:41.770
They would record the band, then
they would play the band

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.990
back while recording something
else, combine those together.

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:46.790
So that was a technique.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.400
The German tape machines allowed
you to actually have

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.830
multiple tracks that
side by side.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:53.780
So you record on a couple of
tracks, then you record on

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.340
another track.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.090
So things we're sort
of familiar with.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:59.790
But that basically '40s,
into the '50s--

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.100
but even in the '50s, most
commercial recordings were

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.420
live recordings, to mono or
possibly starting to get into

00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.500
three-track tape, but eventually
going to be mono

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.180
going out into the world.

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.720
But once you start having these
multi-track tapes, then

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.420
you have to mix those
things together.

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:18.700
So this created something
in the music

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.060
industry that didn't exist.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.160
It used to be there were only
recording engineers who

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.380
captured things.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.400
Now all of a sudden, you needed
people who could take

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.570
all the stuff that was captured,
combine it together,

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.480
and make it something that
could go off into

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.580
the world to be heard.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.600
So that's the mix of
the recording of

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.550
the song with overdubs.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:37.230
And then, once you actually
had consumer formats--

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:42.450
whether it was the cylinders or
onto LPs or 45's or 78's or

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.690
cassettes or eight-track
tapes, up into CDs--

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.630
you needed to have some sort
of standard as to how the

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.250
music would have to be put onto
these media to then be

00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:53.280
distributed.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.100
So you would get your mastered
mix of the recording of a song

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.050
with overdubs.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.560
Now in a room full of engineers,
that kills.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.530
That's really funny, because
it's a font joke.

00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:06.210
Mastering makes things loud.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.960
That's the idea so-- all right.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.980
I'm sorry.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.310
It's the wrong crowd.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:15.420
OK, so this is now what
the artist sends off

00:11:15.420 --> 00:11:16.910
into the world, OK?

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:18.220
This is what a record is.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.370
But it's much more
than that, right?

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:24.660
Music, pre-recording, was
nothing more than art.

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:26.360
There was some commerce
involved, but it

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.450
was basically art.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.000
It was musicians and composers
who would have a piece of

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.150
themselves that they would want
to capture, and then let

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.720
other people here it, and
recreate the emotion they were

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.560
trying to create when they
performed the music live.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.240
So let's say that really, the
recording is more like this.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.300
And you don't have to read it.

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.560
The point is I needed to get a
lot of text on the screen for

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.560
later on for one of my very
clever, inaccurate analogies.

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.520
The idea being that we need to
keep in mind that this is art,

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:57.930
and this is the difference
between looking at an art book

00:11:57.930 --> 00:12:00.050
and going to a museum, OK?

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.700
There are differences.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.660
And the idea of live performance
versus recording

00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.690
is one stage of this
difference.

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:09.080
But there's also a huge
difference depending on how

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.250
that recording gets to you
at the end of the day.

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:15.530
And when we actually get to the
listening portion, I think

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.680
someone once said it's stuff
that you can't unhear.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.680
You'll hear the difference
between some of these file

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.460
formats and bit rates and things
like that, and you'll

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.400
decide for yourself whether
it makes a difference.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.020
My theory is I think it does.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.340
OK, so now we're going to
go through part of the

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.730
presentation, which is a little
more technical, which

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.810
means it's a little dumbed
down for most of the

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.530
people in this room.

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:39.100
But there are a couple
important things.

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.070
So the first thing is,
the difference

00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:44.360
between sound and audio.

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:47.380
And I'm sure most people in this
room know this, but the

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:52.160
idea that's important is that
all sound is analog, period.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.540
An analog meaning infinitely
variable, OK?

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.230
Until you get down to the
molecular quantum level, any

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.650
sound in the air is infinitely
variable acoustic pressure

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.390
waves that travel around
the room, right?

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.030
Everybody cool with that?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:11.135
Now, you can buy a digital
microphone or a digital pair

00:13:11.135 --> 00:13:14.540
of headphones, and that isn't
actually what they are.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:17.090
They are analog microphones
and analog headphones that

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.200
happen to have converters
built into them.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.470
So they are two things in one.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.130
But they are an analog device.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:24.850
There's no such thing as
a digital microphone.

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.090
The only way you can record
something is to put something

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.070
in the air in the way of the
pressure wave so it moves

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.660
because of the pressure wave,
and then using lots of

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.880
different technologies for how
you design your microphone.

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.120
You turn that into a
voltage is the most

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.310
common way to do it.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:42.610
Then, you can digitize
the voltage, OK?

00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.410
So this would be the
simplest sound.

00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:46.160
It's a sine wave.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.220
It's information at only
one frequency.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.145
But the idea is while it's a
sound wave, you zoom in, you

00:13:53.145 --> 00:13:54.230
zoom in, you zoom in.

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:55.750
It never pixelates, right?

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:57.940
It's smooth all the way down.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.810
So the idea of digitizing--

00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:03.260
and this is where, feel free
to take a nap or something

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:04.530
real quick.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.010
So obviously with digital
systems, you don't have the

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:10.940
luxury of looking at something
infinitely many times a

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.230
second, right?

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.110
You have to have a clock.

00:14:13.110 --> 00:14:15.270
You have to decide how many
times you're going to look.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:18.370
So for the producers and
engineers I talk to, this is

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.720
actually really helpful.

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:24.280
I know it's very simplistic,
but it's just the easiest

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.720
visual representation
of what sampling is.

00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.370
So the idea is, time
across the bottom,

00:14:30.370 --> 00:14:32.090
voltage up and down.

00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:33.670
And every time there's
a vertical

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.980
line, that's a sample.

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:38.410
So how many times a second--
let's say that's a second, and

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:40.100
then we count the number lines,
and that's how many

00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:41.720
times a second we're
looking at it.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:45.250
And each time we look, we say,
how big's the voltage?

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.350
And we write it down
using a number.

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:52.220
And how many bits we get to
write down that number are our

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.020
horizontal lines.

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:55.600
Everybody's good with
that, right?

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.770
So the idea being that if you
look at this particular grid

00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:02.990
superimposed on the sine wave,
we almost never go directly

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:04.440
through an intersection.

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.210
So we are always wrong.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:07.820
We are always rounding.

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:11.300
And obviously, anyone in the
room who really knows digital

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:13.170
theory knows that that's OK.

00:15:13.170 --> 00:15:15.100
There's one quantization error,
but you make up for it,

00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:17.440
and you can reconstruct
things quite well.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.600
You'll also know this sample
rate is way higher than we

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:22.400
actually need to capture
this sine wave.

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.940
You only need just over
two samples per

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:26.680
cycle, and your good.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.690
So that's fine.

00:15:27.690 --> 00:15:30.510
And I'm not saying that this is
not a good sample for this

00:15:30.510 --> 00:15:31.460
particular sine wave.

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:31.990
But as a visual

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:33.700
representation, it's important.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.430
The idea being, though, if we
want to be more accurate, we

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:37.680
can do two things--

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.860
we can up the sample rate, and
we came up the bit depth.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.320
So now, this is sort of the
aha moment for a lot of

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.250
engineers who've got little
pop-up menus for sample rates

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:49.070
and bit depths, and they don't
actually know what they do

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:53.790
other than bigger is better,
So I'll record more stuff.

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.660
Now there are diminishing
returns.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:16:02.700
In terms of actually building
audio hardware, it's very hard

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.180
to build something that will
work equally well at every

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.120
single sample rate.

00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.840
And I do lots of listening tests
for just my studio for

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.480
making records, and I found
that there's a lot of gear

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.950
that works great at 96
kilohertz, and up at 192, it

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:18.710
doesn't really work so well,
because some things are

00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:20.735
getting stressed, and it's just
not optimized for it.

00:16:20.735 --> 00:16:24.210
So it's not always that higher
sample rate is better.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:26.720
But in a perfect system, a
higher sample rate will be

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.750
more accurate more
of the time.

00:16:28.750 --> 00:16:29.180
Right?

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.660
I mean, I think that's
fair enough to say.

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:31.830
And the same thing
with bit depth.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:33.580
And in some ways, bit
depth is more

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.310
important than sample rate.

00:16:35.310 --> 00:16:38.090
Now the other thing is you could
very easily make the

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:43.580
theoretical argument that 44.1
kilohertz is fine, because

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:47.420
human hearing goes up to
around 20 kilohertz?

00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:51.100
And I know everyone probably
already knows this, but

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.100
basically, take your sample
rate, divide it by 2.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.960
That's the highest frequency
you can capture

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.370
at that sample rate.

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:57.040
Fair enough?

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.460
So 44.1, you get
down to 22.05.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:03.200
Wow.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.660
22.05.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:05.190
There you go.

00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:05.710
Sorry.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:08.130
My math just went
out the window.

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:12.550
But the problem is, to make that
work, you need a perfect

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.839
filter that cuts off everything
above that

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:18.369
frequency, but doesn't touch
anything below it, right?

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:20.500
That filter cannot be built.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.119
It doesn't exist, especially
as an analog filter.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:26.500
So this is part of why higher
sample rates are really

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.060
important for capturing
things--

00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:31.560
to get an accurate picture at
20k, you kind of need to leave

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.690
it alone out to 40 or 48,
something like that.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.220
So if you start working at 96,
and you can either use very

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:41.520
gentle analog filters or you
can start getting into

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.260
over-sampling and digital
filters, but you can do things

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:48.440
way past where we hear that
are brutal, and they don't

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.380
affect what goes on down
where we do hear.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.340
Now there are also people who
argue that we respond to

00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.850
frequencies above 20k.

00:17:56.850 --> 00:17:58.200
We're not getting into that.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.580
We're not getting into, we
should be tuning everything to

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.780
436 instead of 440.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:05.230
There are lots of holistic
arguments about lots of

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.710
things, and I try and keep
things more real and in

00:18:10.710 --> 00:18:14.090
numbers, because then I don't
have to argue about them for

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.440
12 hours, and not
get anywhere.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.880
So I try and keep it that way.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:22.070
So anyway, this is basically
what I try and impart about

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:24.370
sampling, even though you
guys know most of this.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:26.270
So then we start talking
about the actual

00:18:26.270 --> 00:18:28.310
consumer formats, OK?

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.310
Now there are two types of
digital audio files.

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:34.220
Again, I'm sure you guys know
this, but there's lossless

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:36.580
audio and there is
lossy audio.

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:40.510
OK, lossless audio is take a
PCM-encoded wave file at some

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:43.110
sample rate and some bit depth,
and you keep all the

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.740
numbers, period.

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:45.670
That's it.

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.730
That's all a loss is.

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.500
It's AIFF, WAV, used to be
Sound Designer, too.

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.230
OK, so those are loss files.

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:55.560
Now if you want to get into
the analog versus digital

00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.620
debate, they're all
lossy, right?

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.850
We've thrown away some
information.

00:18:58.850 --> 00:18:59.500
But we're not there.

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:01.930
Let's say that our capture
is awesome.

00:19:01.930 --> 00:19:04.540
Let's say we're working
at 96k, 24-bit.

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.200
We've got lots of information.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.910
If we keep all that information,
it's a loss file.

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:10.650
Lossy is--

00:19:10.650 --> 00:19:13.420
and again, I'm just going to go
through the presentation.

00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:14.960
You guys know all of
this already, which

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.610
is why it's so great.

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:20.770
So lossy is the difference
between zipping a file, and

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.270
using something where when you
unzip your 25-page paper

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:26.305
you've just written, it's
missing a bunch of letters and

00:19:26.305 --> 00:19:27.560
there's stuff spelled wrong.

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:30.100
And again, for a lot of
producers and engineers, they

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:32.260
don't actually understand
this concept.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.420
They assume that lossy
compression is still OK,

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.980
because you end up with a PCM
audio stream at the other end.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.020
But it's reconstructed, and
stuff is thrown away to

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.960
actually make those files.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.580
And the reason being that if
you zip an audio file, you

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:49.000
save maybe 20%.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.180
If you use FLAC, which is
optimized for audio, you can

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.350
maybe save 50% of the space.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:55.500
But that's it.

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.170
So if you do some quick math,
and you're looking at a CD,

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.890
let's say, which is at 44.1,
16-bit, you're talking about

00:20:02.890 --> 00:20:07.000
10 megabytes for every minute
of stereo music.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.290
Those are big files.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:11.010
You guys spend a lot of time
trying to get files from one

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:13.480
place to another quickly
and efficiently.

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.740
Those files are too big,
especially up to a few years

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:18.950
ago with the data pipes
going to phones,

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:19.970
all the mobile devices.

00:20:19.970 --> 00:20:21.990
There's no way you're going
to send that much audio.

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:25.870
So this is why the lossy
codecs actually exist.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:31.270
So very briefly, Fraunhofer,
which is based up here,

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:36.430
developed first the MP3 lossy
codec, and then more recently,

00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:38.570
the ADC codec.

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:41.370
These are based upon
the way you hear.

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:43.950
If you know anything about the
way your brain processes the

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.460
information from your ears, your
ears have just got lots

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:48.380
of hairs in it.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.890
And Julie will probably
talk more about

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.220
this than I need to.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.260
But you basically are splitting
things into

00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.650
different frequencies.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.050
All of that information comes
up into your brain.

00:20:57.050 --> 00:21:00.220
Your brain then processes it,
and decides, I don't need to

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.260
listen to that, not going to pay
attention to that, I hate

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.990
that, screw that-- oh,
that's important.

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.880
And then that's what you hear.

00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.780
So there's lots and lots of
information that's thrown

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:09.890
away, which is why in a
crowded room, you can

00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:12.110
concentrate on a conversation
with somebody, because you

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:13.870
start to mask things out.

00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:15.750
And the same is true when you're
listening to music.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.710
There are lots of things
that can be masked out.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.280
So through a lot of research,
they decided, what can we

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.310
throw away, right?

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.330
The idea being that if we take
care of getting rid of some of

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.300
this information, then all of a
sudden, we're dealing with a

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.190
much smaller file.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:32.780
And if you compare file sizes, a
decent bit rate MP3 is maybe

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:36.170
10% of the size of the
uncompressed audio file.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:40.070
Yet in some listening tests, you
might be able to actually

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:42.810
do pretty well against the
file it was encoded from.

00:21:42.810 --> 00:21:47.040
OK, so this is where I get very
inaccurate, and people

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.590
actually got mad at
me about this.

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:51.310
But that's OK, because I'm up
here and you're back there,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:53.920
and you'd have to jump
over the screens.

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.300
So this is the way I explain
lossy encoding to people.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.200
So if we go back to our
paragraph of lots and lots of

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.220
text, if I take out some of
the vowels, everybody can

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.240
still read this just as fast
as they used to, right?

00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:10.470
The idea is your brain is
predicting what should be

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:12.510
there as much as it's
taking the input of

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:14.030
what actually is there.

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:18.450
So if we look at the word
"mastered" in that first line,

00:22:18.450 --> 00:22:21.855
as soon as you get to the M and
you see the "stered" after

00:22:21.855 --> 00:22:24.390
it, your brain has decided
there's probably an A there.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:25.750
There's room for an A there.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:26.770
There's an A there.

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:27.560
It fills in the blank.

00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.600
If you have a tiny little smudge
on the page, your brain

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:30.685
is all about it.

00:22:30.685 --> 00:22:32.390
That is an A. Absolutely.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:34.300
Whereas on its own, that
smudge is nothing.

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:35.300
It's a smudge.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.120
So that's the basic idea, is
finding what can we throw

00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:42.670
away, and still be able to
read as fast we can?

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:45.950
Or, listen and enjoy the music
without having to figure out

00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:47.590
what it was supposed
to sound like?

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.120
So the idea being that if I only
take out those vowels, we

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.890
don't save a whole
lot of space.

00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:56.110
If I take out all the vowels,
now we're really starting to

00:22:56.110 --> 00:22:59.890
save some space, and we can
compact it down, but I can no

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.090
longer read this, OK?

00:23:02.090 --> 00:23:04.210
So somewhere is a threshold.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.190
The problem is when you're
reading, you have very

00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:08.520
discrete chunks of data.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.950
You either know what that
word is, or you don't.

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.030
Maybe you can fill in a word
from the context around it,

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:16.260
but that's kind of as
far as you can go.

00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:19.680
When you're listening to music,
at some point it just

00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.830
sounds bad, and you don't
really want to

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:23.330
listen to it anymore.

00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:25.850
Sometimes it sounds so bad that
it's kind of crazy and it

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.770
sounds like it's under
water, and more

00:23:27.770 --> 00:23:30.170
like whales than music.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:33.430
But until you get to that point,
it's very hard to say,

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:36.510
yeah, OK, we compressed too
much, because you could put

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:38.100
someone in the room, and
especially if they know the

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:40.530
song, they'll fill in some
blanks on their own, and

00:23:40.530 --> 00:23:41.880
they're like, yeah,
I like this song.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.770
It's all good.

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:47.450
So the problem with audio is you
go from this analog sine

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.740
wave-- which no matter how
far we zoom in, is still

00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.000
infinitely varying.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.770
We capture it, we compress
it, we send it off, we

00:23:54.770 --> 00:23:57.680
reconstruct, but we're starting
to reconstruct

00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.070
something that's a little
more stepped.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:02.130
Now again, this will get
smoothed out by things in both

00:24:02.130 --> 00:24:05.450
the circuitry and also by your
ears, so there are lots of

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.470
things working to help you out
in reconstructing this

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.020
waveform along the way.

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:14.470
But you compress too much, and
then you start getting to

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:16.860
things that start to not really
sound like sine waves,

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:18.660
or they've got so many harmonics
on them that you

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.390
don't hear them as a
sine wave anymore.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.350
And at that point, you're
listening to something

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:23.810
different than what
you started with.

00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:28.800
And I think that is more akin
to someone who kind of sucks

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.800
at art, copying paintings, and
selling it to you, and like,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.490
yeah, I'll put that
on my wall.

00:24:33.490 --> 00:24:35.680
Now for $10 and I
can download it?

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.540
Maybe that's a trade-off
you're willing to make.

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:41.560
But in terms of taking the art
that this artist has made, and

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.580
saying, this is my record, and I
love it, and it makes my mom

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.180
cry, at some point you're going
to send them such a low

00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:51.180
bit rate file that their mom's
not going to cry anymore.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.720
And that's a drag, because at
that point you've lost the

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.170
point of the music, right?

00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:56.810
It's art coming through
speakers.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.800
It's emotion coming
through speakers.

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.860
So what can we do as record
makers, and then what can we

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:06.740
do as people who get that music
out into the world to

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:07.840
help people listen to it?

00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.310
And the great part is, I would
assume that everybody in this

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.710
room listens to music
recreationally.

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:16.140
Let's start with the hands of
people who don't listen to

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.660
music ever.

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.180
OK, so not only are we in charge
of making this music

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:26.110
and getting it out there, but we
also consume it, so we want

00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:28.440
to make products that we
actually like, which with a

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.010
lot of things, people don't
actually buy their own

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:33.970
products, whereas this is sort
of the ultimate consumer

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.990
product, because everybody's
into it one way or another.

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:41.250
So going back to the actual
consumer formats.

00:25:41.250 --> 00:25:44.000
Within the loss category,
you've really

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.270
only got two choices.

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:49.580
You have CDs, which are dying a
very quick death, which are

00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.660
set at 44.1 16-bit
audio, right?

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.830
Then you've got what
is called high res.

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:58.830
And this is a term that people
can argue about.

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:04.610
All it means is anything better
than 44.1 16-bit, OK?

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.790
So when the Beatles re-released
their catalog, I

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:10.980
dunno, six years ago, something
like that, there was

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:13.090
a version you could
buy on a USB stick

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:15.140
which was 44.1 24-bit.

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:18.120
That is high res audio, because
it's higher than a CD.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:21.600
So that's what the term means
out in the audio world.

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:25.520
Now for me, I like to think of
high res being up at 96k or

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.230
something like that.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.880
But in terms of consumer audio,
that's what you get.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.230
Now in terms of buying high
res audio, there are very,

00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:32.550
very few options.

00:26:32.550 --> 00:26:36.360
There's HDtracks, who will sell
you things to download,

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:39.050
and there's this crazy
Java file.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.740
OK, has anyone bought anything
from HDtracks in this room?

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:42.860
So a few people.

00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.980
Is there anybody who thinks that
it's so easy to download

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:49.290
and play back this stuff that
everybody should be doing it?

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.095
OK.

00:26:50.095 --> 00:26:51.810
Got a couple.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.370
So there are a lot of things
involved, and I'll talk a

00:26:54.370 --> 00:26:56.580
little more about what
I have set up here to

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:57.550
play this stuff back.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:27:00.920
It's hard to get the high res
music, and it's hard to play

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:01.750
it back properly.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:03.690
It's easy to play
it back wrong.

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.580
Anybody can do that.

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.240
Just throw it in iTunes or any
other music player, it'll play

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.120
back wrong, and you're
all good.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.210
But you're getting into
transcoding, and things that

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:12.430
you don't really want
to get into.

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:16.150
But anyway, that's what you've
got for the two viable sort of

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:17.830
ways you can get
lossless audio.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:19.240
There are a couple others
that, once we start

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.250
listening--

00:27:20.250 --> 00:27:22.690
excuse me-- once you start
listening that I'll actually

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:23.860
show you, which are
kind of cool.

00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:25.720
There's high res streaming
starting to

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:26.980
happen, adaptive streaming.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.530
It's really awesome.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.680
OK, then we get into the lossy
formats, and those files are

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.860
basically MP3 and AAC,
which are the

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.600
two Fraunhofer codecs--

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.010
AAC having not necessarily
superseded MP3, but just

00:27:39.010 --> 00:27:40.300
coming after.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.750
I think Robert from Fraunhofer
would argue that

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:43.730
it supersedes it.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:45.940
But obviously, there's tons
of stuff still coming out

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:47.990
on MP3 as you go.

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.840
Depends how you encode
things like that.

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.400
Then there's ogg vorbis, which
other than Wikipedia, I don't

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.090
know much about it.

00:27:54.090 --> 00:27:56.240
Is it that it's open source?

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.460
OK, so it's the open
source encoder.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.800
There you go.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.840
But of course, there are open
source MP3 decoders, which

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:04.210
skirt Fraunhofer's license.

00:28:04.210 --> 00:28:06.180
Because if you get the lame
encoder, you're not paying

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:07.010
them, either.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.470
So I don't know.

00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:09.750
That's vague.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:10.160
Yes?

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.301
AUDIENCE: It's totally
patent free, as

00:28:11.301 --> 00:28:12.040
well, but that's debatable.

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:12.930
ANDREW SCHEPS: The ogg vorbis?

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:14.650
OK, so ogg vorbis is
patent-free, which I guess

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.070
would be the main difference.

00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:18.550
Because if you can build
yourself an MP4 encoder that's

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:20.600
open source, you're
getting around--

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.540
anyway.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.910
Robert and I had a very long
conversation about this, and

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:25.710
he was awesome.

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:26.960
He was very, very
good about this.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.550
I thought he was going to kill
me, but he was great.

00:28:29.550 --> 00:28:33.990
OK, so if we actually start
looking at the services

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:37.030
themselves, this is where for
the producers and engineers

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:39.210
it's a big, big deal, because
this is the stuff where they

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:41.880
don't necessarily understand
things.

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.310
I mean, they understand, but
it's the stuff you know but

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:45.710
you don't know.

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:49.220
So the CD and high res are both,
I'm going to say, WAV.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:51.970
You can buy it is FLAC, but
that's just compressed WAV.

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.170
There are AAIFs and things
floating out there.

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:58.630
But WAV is the most robust and
the most prolific form of

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.160
uncompressed audio.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.350
Everything else is not WAV.

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.810
OK, so it's either--

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:08.870
all right, first of all, who
here is from the Play Music?

00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:12.270
OK, I need an answer, because
I have scoured your website,

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:16.420
and it says it plays up
to 320 kbps files.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:21.120
So what format, and what
does the up to mean?

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.420
I can't-- is that
an NDA thing?

00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.130
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:24.130 --> 00:29:25.200
ANDREW SCHEPS: So it's MP3s.

00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:26.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.810
ANDREW SCHEPS: And I'm assuming
it's scaled, so as

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:32.320
you test bandwidth, do go--

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.053
I'm going to guess,
128, 256, 320?

00:29:35.053 --> 00:29:37.771
AUDIENCE: 192, 256.

00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:38.680
ANDREW SCHEPS: OK.

00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:41.030
So three tiers topping
out at 320.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:43.060
OK, I couldn't--

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.100
and this is part of
the problem of

00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:45.870
looking for this stuff.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.140
And I don't think--

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:48.870
and you can correct
me if I'm wrong--

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:52.130
I don't think anyone is
intentionally being obscure

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:53.520
about this.

00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.230
Maybe you are.

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:56.100
Are you being intentionally?

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.470
Are you obfuscating?

00:29:57.470 --> 00:29:59.300
I love that word.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.750
Maybe you are a little bit.

00:30:00.750 --> 00:30:02.000
OK.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.380
So--

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:07.694
yes, sir?

00:30:07.694 --> 00:30:10.262
AUDIENCE: If people in front
can move maybe towards the

00:30:10.262 --> 00:30:11.585
back of the room, we're
going to playing stuff

00:30:11.585 --> 00:30:12.980
out of those speakers.

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.670
ANDREW SCHEPS: Yeah, that's
going to hurt.

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.460
I think what we can do actually
is, what's going to

00:30:18.460 --> 00:30:21.060
happen is at about 10 to 5:00,
Julie's going to speak,

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:23.100
because she's got
a presentation

00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.310
about what she's doing.

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.320
And we're technically sort of
4:00 to 5:00, but we also have

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.630
the room to 6:30.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:34.720
So what I'd love to do is we've
got 15 minutes, I'll

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.280
finish going blah blah blah.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:39.680
We can maybe do some questions
where you guys kick my ass.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.720
Can I say ass on this?

00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.800
It's internal, right?

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.010
You can kick my ass.

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:46.420
And then, we'll break
for Julie to speak.

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.170
And then, we'll do the
listening, and people who have

00:30:48.170 --> 00:30:50.070
to go can go, but then we can
also shove people into the

00:30:50.070 --> 00:30:51.010
middle of the room, because
you guys are

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:52.470
going to get killed.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:54.790
I mean, I'm not going to have
it crazy loud, but still,

00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:57.640
you're going to get killed
a little bit.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.790
OK, so finding all of
this information.

00:31:00.790 --> 00:31:03.130
OK, how many people
from YouTube?

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.120
Do we have anyone?

00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:06.050
OK, so we got a couple.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:08.530
Finding out the information on
what happens with the audio on

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:12.960
YouTube was not that difficult,
but it was also a

00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.960
little odd in that-- so does
everybody in the room know why

00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.940
there are two bit rates, and
everybody in the room know

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.770
when you get which one?

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:22.980
OK, there you go.

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.680
So here's the problem.

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.820
It's tied to the video rate.

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.380
There's no setting that says,
give me good audio.

00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:32.570
There's only the setting that
says, give me good video.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:33.630
So basically--

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.190
and you can correct
me if I'm wrong--

00:31:35.190 --> 00:31:38.890
720 and 1080 give you 384.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:43.510
Everything else gives
you 128, OK?

00:31:43.510 --> 00:31:44.540
Here's the problem--

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.350
a lot of people can't afford to
make videos for every song

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:51.050
on their record, and a lot of
people who buy records and

00:31:51.050 --> 00:31:53.910
then really like a song and want
to upload it to YouTube

00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:57.780
don't make a video that's
HD for that song.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.180
So you upload static art work,
or you upload lyrics, or you

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.120
upload a picture of your
dog-- or cats.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.300
Cats are the internet, right?

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.340
So it's kittens.

00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:10.660
But unless it's awesome footage
of a kitten, nobody is

00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:12.550
going to switch to HD.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:14.500
Nobody.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:19.360
And it doesn't default to HD, so
nobody here's your music at

00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:24.280
384, which is, in terms of pure
bit rate, the highest of

00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:28.440
the lossy formats available,
period, and nobody hears it.

00:32:28.440 --> 00:32:32.860
Yet from numbers I've seen,
and I'm sure my NDA won't

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.900
cover this because I haven't
even signed one, but for

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.150
numbers I've seen, 80% of music

00:32:37.150 --> 00:32:39.020
discovery happens on YouTube.

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.940
Somebody says, hey, have you
heard vrr, and I go, I don't

00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:43.080
know, let me search for it.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:46.620
And you put it in, and you
listen to it on YouTube.

00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.600
So 80% of the time, people are
being introduced to music with

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.720
one of the lowest bit rates on
the board, when the highest

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.430
rate on the board is actually
there, though not available

00:32:56.430 --> 00:32:58.000
for most of the videos,
because people aren't

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.020
bothering to upload HD video.

00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:04.390
And should be just
to finish up the

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.270
YouTube thing right now?

00:33:06.270 --> 00:33:08.010
OK, and this is something
I'm hoping--

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.350
I know I'm speaking with some
of you tomorrow, but I would

00:33:10.350 --> 00:33:11.960
love to get--

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.910
my email address is my name,
andrew@scheps.com.

00:33:14.910 --> 00:33:16.740
Hunt me down, find me,
because I'd love to

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:17.490
discuss this stuff.

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.900
Because another thing is going
through all of the YouTube

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:23.440
documentation, there's nothing
that I could find about audio

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:26.700
upload guidelines.

00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:29.390
OK, so there are no audio
upload guidelines on the

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:30.150
YouTube site.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:31.460
Zero.

00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.800
The problem is, of course, what
you're ending up with are

00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:38.910
128 and 384 AACs, but most of
the time, people are uploading

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:40.400
lossily compressed audio.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:41.630
So you're transcoding.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.360
Is there anybody in the room who
disagrees that transcoding

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.780
is the worst sounding thing you
could ever do to a piece

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.820
of audio between two
lossy format?

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.690
Because we'll fight later.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:56.590
OK, there are amazing sounding
lossy encoded files.

00:33:56.590 --> 00:34:01.250
384 AAC, I would defy most
people to sit in a room, do

00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:06.870
double-blind test between 384
AACs properly encoded and CDs.

00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:09.340
I would defy anybody to not tell
the difference between

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.449
384 transcoded AAc that came
from any other lossy format.

00:34:13.449 --> 00:34:15.630
It sounds terrible.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.739
This is one of the things
we're hoping to

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:18.900
move forward with.

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:21.020
So anyway, this is one
of the problems with

00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.020
comparing the services.

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.230
But the big problem that a lot
of the people I speak to

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.530
normally have is they don't know
how to compare the 44.1

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.210
and the 256, and zero
consumers know how.

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.790
256 is way more than
44, right?

00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:40.909
I rest my case.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:44.610
But when you're trying to
actually educate people about

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:47.810
just what this is, you need to
come and sit in a room, and

00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:50.130
have me go blah blah blah,
and show you a chart.

00:34:50.130 --> 00:34:54.449
So the idea is that, again, as
with any scientific thing,

00:34:54.449 --> 00:34:55.670
you've got to look
at the units.

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.850
And the kilohertz and bit depth
is totally different

00:34:59.850 --> 00:35:01.240
from kilobits per second.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.900
Now the cool thing is that all
of the lossy formats are

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.700
actually very transparent
with their bit rate.

00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:08.910
OK, this is, again, where
I make records.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.020
I don't work with computers
all the time.

00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:11.840
I'm rounding.

00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.200
There's no 1024.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.900
The numbers are very round,
because it's easy for us

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.480
people to understand.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.070
All right, so basically, I
take your bit rate, I put

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:22.370
three zeroes on the end, and
that's how many bits per

00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:26.120
second I get to represent my
stereo piece of art that makes

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.760
my mom cry.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.960
Then actually do the math--

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.540
44,100 times 16 times 2, and
we're at 1.4 million on a CD.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.110
Now obviously, the codecs that
encode the lossy encoders are

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:41.430
very smart.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:44.410
So it's not like just take a
percentage, and that's how

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:45.930
much worse at sounds.

00:35:45.930 --> 00:35:47.610
I absolutely get that.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:50.560
But we're talking at a very big
difference, and then you

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.300
look at the 192 32, which is the
highest I've seen coming

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.310
off of HD tracks.

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:58.630
And you're up to 12.2 million.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.610
OK, the problem being in the
grand scheme of things that

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:05.780
that's really not a whole lot
compared to the analog we

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.490
started with.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:08.910
So again, we're not going to go
the analog versus digital

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.840
debate, but how many people
here like vinyl?

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.710
How many people actually look
to see if the vinyl's done

00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:15.730
from the analog masters instead
of digital remasters?

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.760
Get some old Blue Note.

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.980
Even just compare it to some
of the reissued Blue Note.

00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:25.300
And it's kind of astonishing.

00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.890
It's like your there.

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.780
OK, so this is where we stop
talking about numbers.

00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.030
And now, I want to go through
this study very quickly.

00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:34.290
This is sort of an
older study.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:37.160
Because of course, the thing
is, does anybody care?

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.220
If nobody cares, then we don't
need to care, right?

00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.220
If this doesn't make a
difference, and it's all just

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.080
a bunch of numbers,
I don't care.

00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:49.130
The idea is I want people to
spend enough money on the

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.850
music that I work on that the
artists I work with cannot

00:36:52.850 --> 00:36:55.580
take a day job so they can
keep making records.

00:36:55.580 --> 00:36:58.500
And I want to be able to afford
to keep making records,

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:01.040
and not necessarily take a day
job, but if you've got

00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.580
something for me, we'll talk.

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:03.750
OK?

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:04.990
That's the idea.

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:08.980
OK, we're not all looking
to be on MTV Cribs,

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.010
because we're not.

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.990
OK, but if people don't care,
then by all means, make the

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:16.570
files tiny, because then
everything else about the

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.560
consumer experience
is awesome.

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:21.860
Instant on, very fast, move it
from one place to another, fit

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:25.770
25 bazillion songs on anything
that fits in your pocket.

00:37:25.770 --> 00:37:27.020
That's all good.

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:30.460
OK, now Harman who were actually
nice enough to send

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.890
up this pair of speakers we're
going to listen to later, this

00:37:32.890 --> 00:37:34.900
study is from a little
while ago to be fair.

00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:39.580
But they decided, we need to
actually know if people care.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.060
Because they don't care what the
outcome is, but they need

00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:44.890
to know the answer to that
question because they make

00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.300
equipment for people
to listen to music.

00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.970
That's what they do.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:51.760
So they need to know, do
we need to be really

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:56.190
concentrating on stuff that
plays back loss audio, or even

00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:57.180
high res audio?

00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.700
Or should we be building better
MP3 hardware decoders

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.190
in, and just deal with that?

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.570
Should we actually limit
the bandwidth?

00:38:04.570 --> 00:38:06.635
When we're starting to talk
about wireless technology--

00:38:06.635 --> 00:38:09.420
I mean, if you look at Sonos
and RedNet and a lot of the

00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.220
really cool networked audio
and wireless audio

00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.080
technologies--

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.490
where do we need to
cap our bandwidth?

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.790
These people need to know what
people like, but they don't

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:18.500
actually have a horse in the
race, because they're just

00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:20.380
going to build the gear
to play it back.

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:24.140
So Dr. Sean Oliver, who works
there, who's a pretty amazing

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:27.270
guy, and he's got labs
that have all

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:28.160
kinds of stuff in them.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.290
They've got stuff that looks
like it's out of an amusement

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:32.900
park, so when you're A-B-ing
speakers, they hydraulically

00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:34.160
move into the same place.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.940
You don't have the differences
in placement when people

00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:39.080
change speakers and
things like that.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.720
So what he decided to do was
get young people, because

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.350
there's a lot of sort of
anecdotal evidence that young

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.420
people not only don't care--

00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.930
but this is the crazy one to me,
and if you know anything

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:54.190
about neurology and cognitive
listening, it's even crazier--

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.930
but that kids these days have
only heard MP3s, so they

00:38:56.930 --> 00:38:59.700
actually prefer them.

00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.840
Again, if anyone wants to
discuss that later, I will

00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.540
talk about that for hours,
because that's the rabbit hole

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.210
I've been down for the
last two years.

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:08.990
But I'll just say that
that is pretty much

00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:11.700
categorically not true.

00:39:11.700 --> 00:39:13.730
So this study from a little
while ago was

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:14.790
meant to prove this.

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.480
So they got a bunch of young
kids these days, or in those

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:21.040
days, both high school and
college age students.

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.640
The only thing that's really
important here-- well, there

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:23.820
are two things.

00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:28.760
One is that, for whatever
reason, they were mostly male

00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.430
students, as opposed to female
students, studying audio,

00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:33.740
which is kind of a drag
at all times.

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:37.100
So that's just the
way it works.

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.490
The other thing is you see this
last column, this level

00:39:39.490 --> 00:39:40.400
of training--

00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:43.170
all this is is that these
students were involved in a

00:39:43.170 --> 00:39:47.710
recording program, or they had
taken a comparative listening

00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:50.410
class or a critical listening
class, or something like that.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:54.760
So they were aware of audio
quality as a thing, as opposed

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.250
to just being someone off the
street who really has never,

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:59.050
ever thought about it, OK?

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:01.230
So that's the break up.

00:40:01.230 --> 00:40:02.570
Here is what they did.

00:40:02.570 --> 00:40:04.890
And I--

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:06.460
all it means is they knew what
they were doing, and it's

00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:07.570
scientific.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:10.160
OK, so it's true double-blind
listening.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.530
These kids don't know what
they're listening to.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.740
They come back multiple times,
and they listen.

00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:18.350
OK, now this is between 128k
MP3, which was what everybody

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:20.220
was selling when they
did this story.

00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.280
And you think, my god, that's
the Dark Ages, but it's

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:24.510
really, what, four years ago?

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:26.120
Maybe five?

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.340
Maybe five.

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:28.990
That's what you could buy.

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:30.360
So between that and CD.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:33.880
So we're not talking high
res HDtracks downloads.

00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:39.390
70% of the time, those stupid
kids liked the CD.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.230
And this isn't even a
what sounds better.

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:43.560
This is a what do you
listening to?

00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:45.410
Which one do you want to hear?

00:40:45.410 --> 00:40:50.550
All right, the important part of
this is going back to this

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:54.780
sort of threshold of where
does my mom cry, is what

00:40:54.780 --> 00:40:56.430
happens emotionally?

00:40:56.430 --> 00:41:00.310
So part of one of my theories
is, if you go back to that

00:41:00.310 --> 00:41:04.070
huge block of text, and you take
out a bunch of vowels, at

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.320
some point it's harder
work to read.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.910
So while you will still
understand the words, and

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:11.800
enjoy the story maybe, you
will be less emotionally

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.620
invested because you're
doing stuff.

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.220
The same thing is true, I
believe, when listening to

00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.850
lossy audio, because while your
brain might throw stuff

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:23.340
away, it's expecting it, and
your brain gets pissed when

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.090
the stuff doesn't show up.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:28.550
So you can create anxiety, you
can create depression at very

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.790
low levels, but at the same
time, it's also filling in the

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.690
blanks for you, right?

00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:35.070
You're taking away
lots of acoustic

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:36.100
things from the music.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:38.820
That's one of the first things
to go are reverb tails and

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:39.910
acoustic cues.

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:41.200
So your brain is recreating.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:45.000
Therefore, it becomes more of
an active process to listen.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.120
Now while that may not be that
much of an issue, one of the

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.010
anecdotal things that really
sent me down this road is that

00:41:52.010 --> 00:41:55.380
my daughter had a friend in high
school who was interning

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.790
with me in my studio.

00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:59.360
And great drummer, really
musical kid, listens to music

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.100
all the time.

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:03.140
And he showed up at the studio
in the afternoon to work on

00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:06.580
something, and he came in, and
he said, man, been listening

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:09.880
to music all day and
I'm exhausted.

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.820
And I don't know how many people
that sounds absolutely

00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.240
crazy to, but that to me is
crazy, because I would wake up

00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:18.160
in the morning and put on
records or cassettes--

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.330
even that I had recorded from
a microphone in front of a

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.660
speaker, so not the highest
quality audio in the world--

00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:26.690
but I would listen for 15 hours,
and my parents would

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:28.800
yell at me, and then I would
listen to headphones in bed

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.910
for a while.

00:42:29.910 --> 00:42:33.620
Even recently, I've gone to
friends' houses who have these

00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:36.380
amazing set-ups, and we listen
to vinyl all day.

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.580
And as my wife can attest, I was
down at this guy's house

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.730
for 15 hours, and I got home at
1:30 in the morning and put

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:43.920
on a record.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.670
I was not exhausted.

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:48.560
When I listen to some of the
streaming audio services,

00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:51.130
though, I get tired.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.040
I get a headache.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.000
I grind my teeth.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.890
And it's not an instantaneous
thing.

00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:57.350
It is not an, oh my god, that's
killing me and making

00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:58.330
my ears bleed.

00:42:58.330 --> 00:43:01.970
But it is, in terms of a
long-term commitment, and I

00:43:01.970 --> 00:43:05.470
would also argue in terms of a
long-term connection between

00:43:05.470 --> 00:43:08.210
people who hear the music
and the artist.

00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:11.100
And one of the most important
things with artists is that

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:14.320
people actually connect with
them on an artistic level.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.100
And that happens by them
experiencing some of the

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.080
emotion that went
into the song.

00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:20.970
And it could be as simple as a
lyric, which means you're in

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.570
pretty good shape
no matter what.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.330
But it could be because of
the chord changes and the

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.360
instrumentation and the
subtleties of the performance.

00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.720
And when we start listening, you
will, I believe, start to

00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:32.510
hear some kind of not
subtle differences.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:34.830
We put the B back in subtle with
some of the things that

00:43:34.830 --> 00:43:37.755
change when you listen back to
back between some of the

00:43:37.755 --> 00:43:40.680
lossily encoded music and
the lossless music.

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.760
In terms of when you get to the
second verse of the song,

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.710
do you feel like, musically,
I've already heard

00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:47.680
this, let's move on?

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.680
Or do you feel like, god, what's
next in the story?

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.380
And man, there's a
new guitar part.

00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:53.380
And these are subtle things.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.020
So if you love an artist, then
it doesn't really matter.

00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:00.140
You will love them even
if it sounds terrible.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:01.580
But what if it's somewhere
in the middle?

00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.730
What if you're kind
of on the fence?

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:08.000
What if the audio quality
actually determines where your

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.390
threshold moves as you're
listening as to whether you're

00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:12.770
going to listen to the next song
on that record, or even

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:14.640
make it to the end of
the first song?

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.210
And I know that part of people
not listening all the way

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.270
through to songs and skipping
around all the time is just

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:21.510
due to changes in consumer
habits, and we're all

00:44:21.510 --> 00:44:24.200
multitasking more, and
things like that.

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:27.260
But for the people here who
listen to vinyl, I think you

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:30.540
may not always flip it to Side
B, but how often do you lift

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.500
with the needle in the middle
of Side A-- unless you're

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.000
DJing a party--

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.770
because you're just kind of
tired of it, and now I

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.450
want to move on?

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:39.320
You'll generally have the
experience of Side A. So

00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.290
you're getting 20 minutes
straight of something.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.070
When you're just listening
online, that

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:44.980
doesn't happen so much.

00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.010
There's a lot of skipping
around, and a lot of moving.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:48.250
But what I've got here--

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:50.510
I went to a few of the
different labels.

00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:53.600
I've got 18 songs and a bunch of
different genres, and I'll

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.000
put up just a list of them.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.480
And you guys will DJ.

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.250
And also, we can talk
about anything.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.180
If anyone has questions or want
to point out stuff I've

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.740
got wrong, I absolutely want
that to happen, as well.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:05.070
And we can do that while we
listen, things like that.

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.950
And I have them in as many
formats as I could possibly

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:11.150
have them in, including--

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:12.710
oh, we didn't make
it to this slide.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:13.560
Sorry.

00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:15.960
Google Play Music, I've got
my playlist from you guys.

00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.510
So hopefully because I'm on your
ridiculously fast, free

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:23.920
Wi-Fi, we'll be getting 320
the whole time I'm sure.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.850
But also, then I want to show
you something called

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:28.520
OraStream, which is
adaptive based on

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.180
bandwidth, which is awesome.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.220
And we'll talk about
other stuff.

00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:33.020
Roundabout.

00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:35.260
OK, really quickly.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.530
The way I'm playing the stuff
back is I'm using my Mac.

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:43.400
I am playing out of a program
called Decibel, which is just

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.920
a very, very simple
music player.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:48.190
And the only thing that it does
is it switches the sample

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.700
rate of the hardware
to match the files.

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:53.340
So that way, we're not doing
any sample reconversion.

00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.360
In software on the way out of
the computer, we get it out to

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:58.890
the converter at its
native sample rate.

00:45:58.890 --> 00:46:00.340
It also crashes a lot.

00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.980
It's a $30 program.

00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:03.170
But it generally works.

00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:08.640
I'm using this Prism Orpheus,
which it's a one-rack space

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.000
eight-channel audio interface.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.840
So it's amazing for recording,
but I'm using it because it

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.490
gives me a volume knob
on the front.

00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:16.340
I'm just using it stereo
going out.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.860
The reason I'm using it, as
opposed to something a little

00:46:19.860 --> 00:46:22.350
more simple, is because some
of my source material is at

00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:26.940
192, so I need a box that'll go
up to 192 without putting

00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:28.580
something else in the middle.

00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.470
I've tried as hard as I can to
make sure that all of these

00:46:32.470 --> 00:46:35.350
different files are from
the exact same master.

00:46:35.350 --> 00:46:36.670
So the same--

00:46:36.670 --> 00:46:38.560
remember my font joke
from earlier?

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:41.270
Sometimes, that happens multiple
times to a release.

00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:42.940
Roundabout is one
of the examples.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:44.360
Sorry, we will listen
really quickly.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:46.280
But I needed to say that
Roundabout is one of the

00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.320
examples of something where it
is actually from a different

00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:51.980
master, the high res version,
because it was from a DVD

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:56.130
audio release from, I don't
know, eight years ago--

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:58.730
way back in the stone ages when
that was a format for

00:46:58.730 --> 00:46:59.980
about eight minutes.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.140
So that is actually a
different master.

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:06.150
But still, it's a pretty
astounding difference.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.280
Now I will also say--

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:11.640
and we can stop this, but anyone
who was at the talk I

00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:15.660
gave at Berkeley knows that
at some point, Robert from

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.570
Fraunhofer made me stop playing
things off YouTube

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:20.670
because he said it's unfair
because it's all transcoded,

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:22.270
and made it him look bad.

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:24.690
And I said, OK, that's fine, but
I wasn't sure if everybody

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:26.890
in the room kind of understood
what had just happened, that

00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:30.390
we just took the biggest player
in music discovery out

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:34.390
of the discussion completely
because it wasn't fair to the

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.570
people who developed the codec
that encode the music that's

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:37.600
on this service.

00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.700
So I will play--

00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:45.230
and that said, I play official
videos if I can find them.

00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.850
But there aren't always
official videos.

00:47:46.850 --> 00:47:50.990
So let's listen to some
Yes, and would you

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:53.570
like to pick a format?

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:55.600
Do you want to go low to
high, high to low?

00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:56.370
AUDIENCE: High to low.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:57.740
ANDREW SCHEPS: High
to low, OK.

00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:01.310
So we'll actually go down
through CDs, because you'll

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:03.660
hear a little bit of the
difference between the master.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:08.670
So this is the 96 24 taken off
the DVD-A, or whatever it was.

00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:09.840
AUDIENCE: Quick question
for you.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:14.210
Are you relying on the digital
analog in your Macbook?

00:48:14.210 --> 00:48:17.650
ANDREW SCHEPS: No, I'm going
FireWire to the Orpheus, and

00:48:17.650 --> 00:48:19.450
the Orpheus is the
D to A converter.

00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:20.990
And it's a great sounding
converter.

00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:23.490
The Prism converters are--

00:48:23.490 --> 00:48:25.400
some people say that they're the
best converters out there

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.230
for music recording.

00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:28.950
In the UK, it's almost
exclusively what's used for

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:30.160
all the orchestral
scoring guys.

00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:34.690
They'll have 80 channels of
the Prism converters.

00:48:34.690 --> 00:48:37.370
And then, we're just going
straight into an amplifier to

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.730
these speakers.

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:38.530
And that's it.

00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:38.980
Yeah?

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.030
AUDIENCE: What are you doing
to match levels?

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:42.730
I'm fudging it.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:45.600
OK, so this is not a
scientific test.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:49.090
This is an anecdotal test.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.660
Unless I unplug the monitor,
which we can do as well,

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:53.580
you're going to know what
you're listening to.

00:48:53.580 --> 00:48:56.050
So I'll try and match levels
as best I can from up here,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:58.060
but it does vary a little bit.

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.970
So I'll always make the high res
stuff louder, because then

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:02.086
you'll like it better.

00:49:02.086 --> 00:49:03.741
AUDIENCE: How much power are
you using to drive the

00:49:03.741 --> 00:49:05.060
amplifiers?

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:08.330
ANDREW SCHEPS: It says
it's 4 by 350.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:12.800
So each speaker is bi-amp, so
we get 700 watts a side.

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:13.870
So I'm barely cranking it.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.200
You let me know how
loud to go.

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.680
And I apologize again.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.178
Yeah?

00:49:19.178 --> 00:49:20.672
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
volume [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:20.672 --> 00:49:22.310
digital in this thing?

00:49:22.310 --> 00:49:22.740
ANDREW SCHEPS: In this?

00:49:22.740 --> 00:49:25.290
No, it's actually an analog
control on the output, which

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:26.380
is bizarre.

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.330
That's what they tell me.

00:49:27.330 --> 00:49:29.100
You can hook it up in lots
of different ways.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:30.990
There's an audio
path within it.

00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:33.220
The way it is supposedly
hooked up is as analog.

00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:36.910
But if it is digital,
I have to be able to

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:37.970
turn it up and down.

00:49:37.970 --> 00:49:39.070
I don't have a choice.

00:49:39.070 --> 00:49:41.680
There have been times when I
actually had an analog control

00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:44.500
room section instead,
but it was a lot of

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.920
gear to bring up here.

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:47.910
So we're going to use that.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:51.930
Again, everything is
going through that.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.770
Everything is constant except
the files themselves.

00:49:54.770 --> 00:49:56.885
AUDIENCE: Is it worth turning
off the air conditioning, or

00:49:56.885 --> 00:49:59.050
will that not matter because
of the volume?

00:49:59.050 --> 00:50:01.240
ANDREW SCHEPS: I think we'll get
over the top of it, yeah.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:06.040
I mean, again, this
is not the most--

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:06.650
here's the crux of this.

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:07.825
And I do want to get to
music for those of

00:50:07.825 --> 00:50:08.230
you who have to leave.

00:50:08.230 --> 00:50:12.460
But the crux of this is that
you could set up audio file

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.560
double-blind A-B tests--

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.500
A-B-X tests-- and be really
precise about this, and see

00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:18.110
what you can tell the
difference of.

00:50:18.110 --> 00:50:20.430
But I think especially as
we jump from ends of the

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.750
spectrum, it's not subtle.

00:50:22.750 --> 00:50:25.490
It's huge differences, and then
it's a question about

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:26.420
whether it matters to you.

00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.830
I mean, who cares if you can
hear the difference?

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:29.340
If you like them both,
then fine.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.830
Then you're good with
the small files.

00:50:30.830 --> 00:50:34.870
I'm not trying to evangelize one
particular type of file,

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:38.570
or to convince anybody that you
have to listen this way,

00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.760
or you're missing out
on the music.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.400
My theory is that once you get
to a certain point, you're no

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:47.050
longer kind of interfering in
the emotional response.

00:50:47.050 --> 00:50:50.690
But in terms of an audio file,
short burst listening test,

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:53.860
this is more fun than anything
else, because it takes a lot

00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.140
of work to actually find all
these stupid files and put

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:56.900
them in one place.

00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:01.150
So that's the fun of it is I
wasted days of my life so that

00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:03.156
we can sit here and DJ.

00:51:03.156 --> 00:51:08.410
OK, so that said, let
me know how loud--

00:51:08.410 --> 00:51:09.003
OK.

00:51:09.003 --> 00:51:14.920
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:51:14.920 --> 00:51:18.000
ANDREW SCHEPS: All right,
and here's CD, which--

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.470
again, a different master, but
it's more to set for when we

00:51:21.470 --> 00:51:22.730
listen to the other formats.

00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:23.870
So this will be the
same master as

00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:26.290
all the other formats.

00:51:26.290 --> 00:51:27.660
OK, so that's pretty
different.

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:29.160
But it's also a different
master.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:35.260
So let's for fun, because
it is fun.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.330
This is when I'm glad I'm
behind the speakers.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:39.610
Sorry.

00:51:39.610 --> 00:51:43.480
Let's just listen to some more
stuff, and then we can talk

00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.688
more, because--

00:51:44.688 --> 00:51:46.560
AUDIENCE: What resolution were
you playing that at?

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:47.880
ANDREW SCHEPS: Well, that
would have been--

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:51.720
is it 128 AAC?

00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:53.490
Because there was no
high def video.

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:56.740
AUDIENCE: OK, so it was an
old upload [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:57.450
ANDREW SCHEPS: I guess, yeah.

00:51:57.450 --> 00:51:59.940
I mean, or it's a static artwork
upload, so they didn't

00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.740
bother uploading it in HD.

00:52:02.740 --> 00:52:03.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:08.820
ANDREW SCHEPS: Yeah.

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.730
OK, so let's do Coltrane.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:12.440
So this is the same
master, OK?

00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:15.340
There have been reissues and
things like that of this, but

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.070
I know for a fact because I got
this from Blue Note that

00:52:18.070 --> 00:52:20.060
this is the same master
in all formats.

00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:22.150
OK, so where do we
want to start?

00:52:22.150 --> 00:52:23.550
You guys tell me.

00:52:23.550 --> 00:52:29.250
So that's A. We'll do A,B,C.
What do you think about that?

00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:30.130
Or do you just want A, B?

00:52:30.130 --> 00:52:31.260
AUDIENCE: A, B, A, B

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:32.350
ANDREW SCHEPS: Just A B?

00:52:32.350 --> 00:52:35.050
Well, hold on.

00:52:35.050 --> 00:52:36.700
A, B or A, B, C?

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.684
A, B. OK.

00:52:38.684 --> 00:52:41.150
AUDIENCE: Are you sure
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:43.840
ANDREW SCHEPS: Yeah,
that happens a lot.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.260
And this is why, again, we had
to stop going to YouTube as

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:50.660
any of them, because a lot of
them are either swapped, or

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.220
depending on the transcoding
start to collapse into mono.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.600
Like the Beatles stuff
is mono, but it's

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.510
not the mono mixes.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:01.174
So yeah, that happens,
but that's--

00:53:01.174 --> 00:53:02.424
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:05.850 --> 00:53:07.341
resolution.

00:53:07.341 --> 00:53:12.160
You can't have very high good
placement [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:12.940
ANDREW SCHEPS: Oh yeah.

00:53:12.940 --> 00:53:14.440
Yeah, I mean, with the CD.

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:18.290
OK, so that was A and B. That
was YouTube versus 192.

00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:20.700
And so again, it was the
low resolution possibly

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.980
transcoded, even though
that was an

00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.860
official Blue Note upload.

00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:25.390
But the problem is--

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:27.790
I mean, I'm sure you guys know,
working at kind of a big

00:53:27.790 --> 00:53:32.480
company, that at some point,
someone told the people at

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.430
Blue Note, OK, now we're going
to start doing our official

00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:36.760
YouTube uploads.

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.540
And here are all the assets,
and go ahead and do it.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:44.400
And that definitely filtered
down to an intern who had to

00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:47.490
sit in front of a computer
uploading for three weeks,

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.020
because nobody who really know
what they're going to do,

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:52.420
knows what they're doing is
going to spend longer than it

00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:55.200
takes to just point them
to the assets.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.290
So their official
uploads could've

00:53:58.290 --> 00:53:59.690
been completely destroyed.

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:01.760
I mean, it's easier
sometimes--

00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:06.180
and this happens at HDtracks
a lot, where they're sent

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.260
something that they're told is
96/24 so that they can sell

00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:13.980
it, but the person who actually
sent them the files

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:19.040
didn't know how to get over the
2 gig file size limit, and

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:23.250
the album was too big, so they
just ripped a CD and sent it.

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:23.890
And it happens.

00:54:23.890 --> 00:54:26.730
And then HDtracks gets in a lot
of trouble, because there

00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:30.510
are a bunch of crazy audiophiles
at home doing FFTs

00:54:30.510 --> 00:54:31.930
of this stuff.

00:54:31.930 --> 00:54:34.520
And also, depending on how it
was recorded, there isn't

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.440
necessarily anything
above 20k.

00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:38.830
But if they don't see stuff
at 40k, they're like,

00:54:38.830 --> 00:54:40.650
that's not high res.

00:54:40.650 --> 00:54:43.410
So there are lots of problems
in the supply chain, as well

00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:45.570
as just the file formats, which
is, again, why this is

00:54:45.570 --> 00:54:49.050
not meant to be a scientific
test, and

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:50.210
more of just an anecdote.

00:54:50.210 --> 00:54:52.350
Now if you want, we can stay
away from YouTube, because it

00:54:52.350 --> 00:54:54.200
is, unfortunately, the
most problematic.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:54.580
But--

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:56.570
AUDIENCE: Which one
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:56.570 --> 00:54:59.670
ANDREW SCHEPS: A was YouTube,
and B was 192.

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.630
Now an interesting thing to me--
with these speakers, I

00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:03.870
added some low end to tune
this room very quickly

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:04.700
before I came in.

00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:08.800
There's some thumping on that
side that I'm hearing on the

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.680
192 which I don't really
hear in the MP3.

00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.840
So you don't always--

00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.410
like, oh my god, it's
just so much better.

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:17.840
Sometimes you uncover other
things along the way.

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.620
AUDIENCE: Do you have a
non-YouTube [INAUDIBLE]

00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:22.440
ANDREW SCHEPS: Yeah.

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.350
We can do--

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:28.010
well, your stuff would be 320.

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:31.000
So we could do 320, or
we could do Amazon if

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.230
you want to do that.

00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:35.120
Let's do Amazon.

00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:37.380
Well, I just told you,
it's Amazon.

00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:38.230
I'll leave it up.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:39.800
OK, but here's Amazon.

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.000
AUDIENCE: Can you do it, and
then we vote which is which?

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:44.110
ANDREW SCHEPS: Yeah.

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:44.440
Yeah.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.180
Let me just play you some of
the Amazon of the Coltrane,

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:48.070
and then we'll go to a different
song, and I won't

00:55:48.070 --> 00:55:50.110
say a word.

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:54.090
Now I'm crazy, so I did some
FFTs of some of this stuff.

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:57.040
And one of the things that
Amazon does-- because they're

00:55:57.040 --> 00:56:00.640
only selling 256 MP3s, that's
what they sell--

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.770
and presumably to help
their encoder--

00:56:03.770 --> 00:56:06.100
because they're not getting
24-bit files, either--

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:09.670
they actually pretty much cut
off everything above 15k.

00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:13.220
So that's ban limited to 15k on
the way into the encoder,

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:17.600
because if you don't have to
bother encoding from 15 to 20,

00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:21.050
you've got that much more
room to encode below.

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.460
So that's their decision.

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.830
Again, now I'm right between
the speakers, so for me the

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:28.640
imaging is a pretty
obvious thing.

00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.400
The 192 is the only one where
things are either on the left

00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.300
or in the right.

00:56:32.300 --> 00:56:35.080
And Rudy Van Gelder, who
recorded this album, did not

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.020
have a pan pot.

00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:36.990
It was a patch cord.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:39.930
It was either in the left or
the right, and that's it.

00:56:39.930 --> 00:56:42.850
So as soon as you get anything
that isn't discretely on one

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:45.730
side or the other, you know it's
part of the process of

00:56:45.730 --> 00:56:48.250
the encoding that has
made things shift.

00:56:48.250 --> 00:56:50.980
And that's another way that a
lot of the encoders work.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:53.520
And I don't know specifically
the ones you use because

00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:56.730
you're writing your own
encoders, if you mono up

00:56:56.730 --> 00:56:58.920
stuff, , it makes it much
easier to encode.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.160
It's one audio stream, and it's

00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.450
identical in both channels.

00:57:01.450 --> 00:57:03.610
So you can save a lot of space
doing it that way.

00:57:03.610 --> 00:57:07.340
And I'm sure that's part of the
pre-encoding of a lot of

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.470
this stuff, especially at
the lower bit rates.

00:57:09.470 --> 00:57:10.500
So that'll happen.

00:57:10.500 --> 00:57:12.990
And it's not that big a deal
on modern pop stuff because

00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:15.390
stuff is everywhere, but any of
the Beatles stuff, all the

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:18.850
old Motown stuff, the Blue
Note stuff, that is all

00:57:18.850 --> 00:57:21.160
discrete stereo, and it will
change it completely.

00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:23.560
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:25.480
are you thinking about
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.620
ANDREW SCHEPS: No.

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.740
No, I refuse to.

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:37.060
So here's my theory, is that I
need to make my records sound

00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.860
as good as I can make them
sound regardless of what

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.420
happens afterwards.

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:44.980
So then, when I realized what
was happening afterwards, I

00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:48.580
asked the Recording Academy so
let me come and talk about it.

00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:50.830
And they said, sure, we've
been trying to figure--

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:52.450
because they've had this
Quality Sound Matters

00:57:52.450 --> 00:57:55.620
initiative officially for a
little over a year, but

00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:57.200
unofficially for the
last 10 years.

00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.260
And they've had ideas about--

00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:02.273
we're going to get buses and put
awesome sound systems in

00:58:02.273 --> 00:58:04.090
them, and we're going to drive
them around and play this

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:06.800
stuff for people, and trying
to come up with ways to let

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.870
people here what the difference
is so that you can

00:58:08.870 --> 00:58:09.850
start to understand.

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.290
So when I came up with this
presentation as a way to do

00:58:13.290 --> 00:58:14.910
it, they were all over it
and have allowed me

00:58:14.910 --> 00:58:15.400
to come and do it.

00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.870
So my idea is to find
out what's actually

00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:20.620
important, and change it.

00:58:20.620 --> 00:58:23.670
I refuse to live with the crap,
and just say, I got to

00:58:23.670 --> 00:58:26.900
make it work on earbuds, because
in five years, it

00:58:26.900 --> 00:58:27.520
won't be earbuds.

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.460
And the pipes will be bigger,
and you guys will flip a

00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:32.420
switch, and it's going to be
either uncompressed or barely

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:32.960
compressed.

00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.580
And so now, I've changed my
whole workflow to cater to

00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.470
something that goes away.

00:58:37.470 --> 00:58:38.850
And it's one of--

00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:41.520
not to talk about your
neighbors-- but it's one of

00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:45.870
the biggest problems I have with
Apple conceptually, is

00:58:45.870 --> 00:58:49.350
that they will talk a lot about
what they want to get

00:58:49.350 --> 00:58:51.840
from the labels and from the
artists in terms of their

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:53.590
ingestion, and they want
24 bit, and they

00:58:53.590 --> 00:58:55.340
want the high res.

00:58:55.340 --> 00:58:59.600
But if I master specifically for
their encoder right now,

00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:03.780
in three weeks, if they say,
bandwidth is awesome.

00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:05.590
We're going to start
selling 320 AACs.

00:59:05.590 --> 00:59:07.680
Well, now it's a new encoder,
or they just

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.690
update their encoder.

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:10.410
All of a sudden, I'm making
decisions based on

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:11.900
things that go away.

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:15.710
And I think it's a very big
difference between the record

00:59:15.710 --> 00:59:19.620
making process and the consumer
distribution world,

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.300
and you can't make records for
the consumer distribution

00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:26.580
world other than a lot of the
analog limitations we used to

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:27.120
have to deal with.

00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.170
Like you can't pan your bass off
to one side if there's a

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.530
lot of low end, and
still cut vinyl.

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.030
OK, like their physical
limitations to things which

00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:35.880
I'm fine with.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.100
And AM radio--

00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.940
they shave off the top and the
bottom, and it's mono.

00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:41.860
OK, that's fine, I know what's
going to happen.

00:59:41.860 --> 00:59:45.590
But in terms of taking some
sort of encoding algorithm

00:59:45.590 --> 00:59:47.910
that's constantly being
updated-- otherwise, some

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.420
people in this room would
be out of a job--

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:53.390
I can't work for that because
it's a moving target.

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:57.170
So my idea is if I make it sound
great, it will survive

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:58.370
the process better.

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:00.530
And that, I've actually
found is true.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:03.260
Like this Blue Note stuff
sound so amazing and so

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:07.520
natural that you can start to
hear things get hashy and it's

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.760
a little more annoying and a
little brash, and the panning

01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.860
isn't as wide.

01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:13.670
But musically, it's still pretty
awesome, and it's OK.

01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:14.550
And it survives better.

01:00:14.550 --> 01:00:19.240
And strangely, a lot of the
urban music survives better,

01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.690
because there's lots of
separation between the

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:22.610
instruments.

01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:25.360
Things are very discretely
encompassed in terms of their

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:27.430
frequencies and things
like that.

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:28.660
They're not sharing
a lot of space.

01:00:28.660 --> 01:00:31.020
You don't have 15 microphones
on a drum kit that are all

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.300
making noise.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.830
So that actually translates
better.

01:00:34.830 --> 01:00:39.400
And strangely, there is zero hip
hop or R&amp;B that I was able

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:41.440
to get, other than the
Espreranza Spalding

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.550
record, in high res.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:43.230
It doesn't exist.

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:44.720
CD is as high as it goes.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:47.280
They turn in masters that are
44.1-16, because they're

01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:49.450
building it on a laptop.

01:00:49.450 --> 01:00:52.582
And they're actually building
their tracks with MP3s.

01:00:52.582 --> 01:00:53.832
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:56.130 --> 01:01:01.520
compressed not in bytes but
making the lowest part of the

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.770
music-- the softest
one-- high.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:10.010
So if people start doing
that [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:12.728
what's the point in
going to high res?

01:01:12.728 --> 01:01:16.530
ANDREW SCHEPS: Well, I would
argue that even something that

01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:19.480
doesn't have a whole lot of
dynamic range, you will still

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:24.150
absolutely here the difference
when you have a very lossly

01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.870
encoded file.

01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:27.300
You start to destroy things
other than just the dynamic

01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:28.320
range, right?

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.700
There's frequency content,
there's panning content,

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:32.640
there's the mono versus
stereo content,

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:33.970
there's depth of field.

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:36.190
There are all of the cues that
are being taken away, all the

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:38.700
acoustic cues and reverb tails
and things like that.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:40.590
And that will affect it even
if it's super loud.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:42.940
I mean, there's this whole thing
called the loudness war,

01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.030
which maybe you know about,
but they just like--

01:01:45.030 --> 01:01:47.620
I won that war, OK?

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:50.160
I mixed "Death Magnetic,"
which was the album that

01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.280
everybody said was the poster
child for things

01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.560
being way too loud.

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.360
OK, so I won.

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:57.780
Therefore, the war is over, we
don't have to worry about it.

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:58.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:04.940
ANDREW SCHEPS: I spent weeks
reencoding for iTunes and

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.900
Amazon at that time
to make those

01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:10.070
files work lossly encoded.

01:02:10.070 --> 01:02:13.580
So what happens is you start
to get rid of dynamic range

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.740
and things like that, is you
start to break the encoders.

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:17.870
The encoders need some
room to work.

01:02:17.870 --> 01:02:20.370
So I'm making it very difficult
for that to work.

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.745
And one of the things we found
that worked great was turn the

01:02:22.745 --> 01:02:25.920
mix down 0.7 db, period.

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.980
Just let there be headroom
that we never even use,

01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:31.290
because it's brick
wall right there.

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:35.230
We never get up to that last
0.7, but all of a sudden, all

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:37.620
of the encoders sounded about
100 times better.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:43.060
When we got to give them 24-bit
files for the last

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.900
Chili Peppers record-- that was
right at the beginning of

01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:47.790
the mastered for iTunes project
at Apple-- and the big

01:02:47.790 --> 01:02:50.470
crux of that project is give
us 24-bit files instead of

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:51.690
16-bit files.

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:53.000
That made a huge difference.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.980
So in terms of what you feed
the encoder, it isn't just

01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:00.440
about the source material in
terms of a sonic thing.

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.800
Because I think there are lots
of hardcore and punk albums

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.850
that, from a sonic audio file
point of view, sound terrible.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:10.550
But they are so super exciting
that people love those bands

01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:12.140
and they want to
listen to them.

01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.640
And if you do a 128 MP3 of that
album, what used to be

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.150
hashy and exciting is now just
hashy and noisy, and I think

01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:23.320
there are lots of people who
wouldn't get into the band as

01:03:23.320 --> 01:03:25.760
much as they would even if they
buy it on a cassette,

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.300
which doesn't have anything
above 12k on it, or

01:03:28.300 --> 01:03:28.980
something like that.

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:32.790
So there are two very different
aesthetic paths you

01:03:32.790 --> 01:03:34.120
can take when you talk
about the music.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:36.610
And the problem is, it's
not like with TV.

01:03:36.610 --> 01:03:41.570
Right, with TV, who is going to
argue that a high def set

01:03:41.570 --> 01:03:44.060
looks worse than an SD set?

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:46.690
Because you see it, and
it's easy to A-B.

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:48.860
Some people like the artifacts
and you're used

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:49.600
to things like that.

01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.170
And if you have a bad digital
set that pixelates,

01:03:52.170 --> 01:03:53.540
there can be issues.

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:56.600
And if you look at bad material
on an HD set, it

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.990
looks terrible.

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.420
OK, so all those arguments
are true.

01:04:00.420 --> 01:04:03.650
But let's say you have a
well-captured still image, and

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.180
you show it on these
two different TVs.

01:04:06.180 --> 01:04:08.290
One of them has way more
information about it and it

01:04:08.290 --> 01:04:10.460
just looks a hell of
a lot better, the

01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:11.440
other one does not.

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.530
Whereas with audio, people don't
trust what they hear.

01:04:14.530 --> 01:04:17.270
People think you have to be
trained to like something

01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:19.820
better when you just talk
about audio formats.

01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.890
And people believe what
they're told, period.

01:04:21.890 --> 01:04:24.930
I mean, nothing influences your
opinion about things more

01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:27.780
than me telling you how
great it is, right?

01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.990
If someone's about to play you
something by a certain band

01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:34.590
and you like them, and they say,
I can't stand this band,

01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:37.400
check it out, you will
not like that band.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.650
If they say this is my favorite
band in the whole

01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:41.830
world, you're going to try
really, really hard to like

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.210
that band because you
like that person.

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:46.220
So there's so much that goes
into liking music that has

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:48.420
nothing to do with any of
this, but it also has

01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:51.750
everything to do with it,
because I really believe that

01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:52.820
there are just thresholds.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.280
And for every person listening
to a new piece of music,

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.080
there's a threshold of,
am I going to like it?

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.340
Am I not going to like it?

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:01.710
And the more you can give them
something that sounds true to

01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:05.840
whatever the artist decided
was done, the lower that

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.900
threshold will be, and the
easier it is to connect.

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:10.890
So regardless, let's listen to
some stuff, unless you want to

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:11.920
keep talking.

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:14.320
AUDIENCE: So when did you do
that, the Death Metallic?

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.250
ANDREW SCHEPS: The Metallica
mix? "Death Magnetic"?

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:17.060
That was--

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:19.260
I don't know, six years
ago, seven years ago?

01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.730
AUDIENCE: What made
you [INAUDIBLE]

01:05:20.730 --> 01:05:22.905
ANDREW SCHEPS: What made
me destroy it?

01:05:22.905 --> 01:05:24.605
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:05:24.605 --> 01:05:25.030
ANDREW SCHEPS: OK.

01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:28.210
That is a conversation
that is not--

01:05:28.210 --> 01:05:29.990
I mean, really the only thing
I would say about that is I

01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:32.220
have nothing to say
about that.

01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.460
The idea that me as an engineer
could mix a record in

01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:39.110
such a way that was destroyed,
but everybody would be OK with

01:05:39.110 --> 01:05:41.410
it and let it out into the
world is just crazy.

01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:43.760
There is a band involved, there
are producers involved,

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.190
there are plenty of people
involved who

01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:47.280
said, this is awesome.

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:50.880
Now during the process, whether
or not I made quieter

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.810
mixes to A B,and an let them
hear differences and whatever,

01:05:53.810 --> 01:05:57.170
I may have done, but
it's irrelevant.

01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:57.870
It's irrelevant.

01:05:57.870 --> 01:06:01.070
What happens is at the end of
the day, that album sounds the

01:06:01.070 --> 01:06:03.090
way it does because that's what
the band and the producer

01:06:03.090 --> 01:06:04.540
thought was great.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.070
And there's some people who
really don't like the way it

01:06:07.070 --> 01:06:09.540
sounds, but there are a lot of
people I've talked to who

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:10.300
think it sounds awesome.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.580
It's super aggressive.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:15.070
It's not the most hi-fi thing
in the world, but a lot of

01:06:15.070 --> 01:06:16.920
stuff I do is not hi-fi.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.030
But I hope that it's emotionally
awesome, and makes

01:06:20.030 --> 01:06:21.830
you love it, and makes you want
to either kick a hole in

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:25.360
the wall or cry or call your
mom or whatever it is that

01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:26.630
we're trying to get across.

01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:31.470
So this discussion in terms of
what you do with that file

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:34.610
afterwards is also very
different from the audio

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.630
quality in the sense
of audio file.

01:06:37.630 --> 01:06:40.120
There are lots and lots of
records that if you go to one

01:06:40.120 --> 01:06:41.800
of the big consumer electronics
shows where they

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:44.980
have a million dollar set-up
where a speaker this size will

01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:49.070
cost you $85,000 each, and
has iridium tweeters.

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:52.240
And you've got a stand for the
turntable that costs more than

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.460
your house-- that
kind of thing.

01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:57.380
You can only listen to audio
file stuff on there, right?

01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:58.740
And so what are you
going to hear?

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:00.910
You're going to hear a few jazz
records and Steely Dan,

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:03.490
and that's kind of it.

01:07:03.490 --> 01:07:06.400
And those are great records,
and they're also amazing

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:07.480
sounding records.

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:10.470
But if you put on something like
the Metallica record on

01:07:10.470 --> 01:07:13.240
there, at that point, maybe
some of that's wasted.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:17.500
But it's not because you're
putting on a low bit rate MP3.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:19.620
OK, another thing just
anecdotally--

01:07:19.620 --> 01:07:20.760
and we will listen more.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.180
I'm sorry.

01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.820
I will talk about
this for days.

01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:26.020
But while I was putting all
these files together, I had

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:28.350
this massive folder of files,
and I'm keep things organized,

01:07:28.350 --> 01:07:29.820
and making sure things
are named.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:33.190
And I was just listening
on my laptop speakers.

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.570
First of all, I'm letting the
OS do sample rate conversion

01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:36.800
in real time.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:39.660
Right, whatever Quicktime has,
that's what happened, so it

01:07:39.660 --> 01:07:42.280
can play back at whatever sample
rate the stuff was set

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.850
to, which is probably 44.1.

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:47.850
And I'm just listening to the
first 25 seconds of each song,

01:07:47.850 --> 01:07:49.830
making sure they're all
the right song.

01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:51.850
I can tell the difference
in my laptop speakers.

01:07:51.850 --> 01:07:55.000
So I bring this set up because
it's cool, and we've got a

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:55.840
room this big.

01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.510
And if I played stuff on my
laptop, no one can here it.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.620
So this helps.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:04.760
But if you have any sort of
decent kind of system-ish that

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:07.720
has some good DSP on the back
end to make it sound pretty

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:10.150
good, and it's got a little bit
of power so some of the

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:13.140
dynamics come through, I think
you absolutely will hear the

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:14.330
difference.

01:08:14.330 --> 01:08:16.319
And even more than that, you'll
feel the difference.

01:08:16.319 --> 01:08:18.569
One of them is just more
fun to listen to.

01:08:18.569 --> 01:08:21.330
But that's a discussion that
could go for weeks, and

01:08:21.330 --> 01:08:23.160
there's no necessarily
right answer.

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.609
But the good thing is, I won the
war, so the war is over.

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:28.644
So now we can all make
quiet records again.

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:31.760
Yeah?

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:35.670
AUDIENCE: So there's a new
standard from the ITU to set

01:08:35.670 --> 01:08:36.790
record loudness levels.

01:08:36.790 --> 01:08:38.370
Are you following that at all?

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:41.080
ANDREW SCHEPS: Well, what
those are as far as

01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.890
understand, and correct me if
I'm wrong, that's what's used

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:45.970
in the Apple Sound Check, as
well, where you scan a record

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:49.140
to say how loud it is, and then
it uses it to even out

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.689
the level if you take advantage
of that in whatever

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:54.090
playback system you're using.

01:08:54.090 --> 01:08:55.120
Is that--

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:55.430
OK.

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:56.150
So basically--

01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:56.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
a little different

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:58.689
from the ITU's standard.

01:08:58.689 --> 01:09:01.279
So there's different, competing
implementations.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.370
ANDREW SCHEPS: Again, I don't.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:05.899
I mean, if we got into
my mix process--

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:07.939
which I could talk for
a different set

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:10.310
of hours about that--

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:12.950
my mixes are what sounds good.

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:16.260
And sometimes, the level of the
mix really doesn't matter.

01:09:16.260 --> 01:09:17.430
But a lot of times, it does.

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:20.390
And I mix on analog equipment
which has voltage rails.

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.910
So as I hit that rail, I
don't just cut it off.

01:09:22.910 --> 01:09:25.430
It smooshes it off, and it takes
a while to smoosh it off

01:09:25.430 --> 01:09:26.439
completely.

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:29.180
And different amounts of
that smooshing differ.

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:32.029
And it's just because I'm in the
analog world, so clipping

01:09:32.029 --> 01:09:34.920
and harmonic distortion are your
friend until they're not

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.090
your friend, and something
catches on fire.

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:40.649
So when I'm mixing something
like the AFI record I just

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:44.350
mixed or Black Sabbath record,
those mixes are going to be

01:09:44.350 --> 01:09:47.479
loud because they don't really
sound right until their loud.

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:49.510
But when I make something
like [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:49.510 --> 01:09:51.590
which is on my label
or jazz record--

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:54.270
I mixed a Jeff Babko
record last year--

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:56.435
those end up being much quieter
mixes, because I want

01:09:56.435 --> 01:09:58.340
it to be more open, and
the dynamic range

01:09:58.340 --> 01:09:59.360
really helps the music.

01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.140
So for me, it's much
more a feel thing.

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.200
And then I find out later that
I've kind of screwed up, and

01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.820
the mastering guy gets angry.

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.440
And then I will send the quieter
makes and say, if you

01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:10.580
get it to sound as good as my
one that you say is too loud,

01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.390
then we're good.

01:10:12.390 --> 01:10:14.920
But if it doesn't feel as good,
then we have to go with

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:15.910
my screwed up mix.

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:18.320
So I'm not the best
person with that.

01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:21.370
There are a lot more technical
mixers than me who adhere to

01:10:21.370 --> 01:10:22.440
things more than I do.

01:10:22.440 --> 01:10:25.140
I'm kind of a disaster
with that.

01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:25.620
Yeah?

01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.600
AUDIENCE: What's your
take on [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.590
Pandora, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:29.330
ANDREW SCHEPS: OK.

01:10:29.330 --> 01:10:34.520
So streaming, I mean, the
filetypes are the same, right?

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.660
And on that chart, I had bit
rates for the streaming files.

01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:41.170
So I have no problem with
streaming versus download.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.410
I mean, there's a whole other
conversation which is about

01:10:44.410 --> 01:10:46.840
making the music business
still exist.

01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:48.980
And that's actually a really
important conversation, and

01:10:48.980 --> 01:10:51.250
encompasses way more
than just this.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:55.060
This is the esoteric, I think
this makes a difference part.

01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:59.030
Then there is the recording
album credits part, which is a

01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:01.760
discussion I'm hoping we're
having tomorrow a little bit--

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:05.100
implementation of that, getting
consumers to interact

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:07.750
directly with artists more,
because that's what creates

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.730
the relationships that last so
that I don't have to go get

01:11:10.730 --> 01:11:11.840
another day job.

01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:14.350
That's my goal in all of that.

01:11:14.350 --> 01:11:21.770
In terms of just the audio,
though, the streaming and not

01:11:21.770 --> 01:11:22.760
is exactly the same thing.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:25.130
So actually let me plug
the monitor back in.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:28.960
And let me show you one other
thing, which is a technology.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.630
It's called OraStream.

01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:33.140
Does anyone in here know
about OraStream?

01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.900
So we've got one, because you
were there last time.

01:11:34.900 --> 01:11:39.090
Does anyone here know about
the MP4 SLS format?

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:42.610
It's another Fraunhofer
encoding format.

01:11:42.610 --> 01:11:46.280
So it's meant to be an archival
strength format.

01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:50.460
So what it does is it will
wrap audio in its own

01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:53.800
metadata, and preserve whatever
the native bit rate

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.850
and sample rate is
of that audio.

01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:58.760
But one of the byproducts it
has is you can do what they

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.020
call truncating of the stream
to produce in real time any

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.200
bit rate stream you want.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.750
So what OraStream have done is
they've come up with all of

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:13.900
the server side and back end
technology to do pinging of

01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.070
your connection in real time,
and to granularly scale.

01:12:17.070 --> 01:12:19.120
So the Google Play Music--

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.620
you've got three bit rates.

01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:24.180
You check out how fast people
are able to get the stuff, and

01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:26.460
you give them the fastest when
you think they can get without

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:27.670
any buffering, right?

01:12:27.670 --> 01:12:29.340
Because buffering sucks.

01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.960
No one wants their
music to stop

01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.920
But that's what you do, right?

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:35.610
And you will skip between
those levels.

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:40.370
So if when you start playing a
song, you're in a black hole,

01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:41.420
even though you're listening
on your cell phone.

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:42.250
You're in a parking garage.

01:12:42.250 --> 01:12:43.660
You're going to start off
at a very low bit rate.

01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.880
Now are you constantly pinging,
and you'll up the bit

01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:47.142
rate as soon as you can?

01:12:47.142 --> 01:12:49.882
Or do you wait for
the next song?

01:12:49.882 --> 01:12:50.730
AUDIENCE: You want for it.

01:12:50.730 --> 01:12:51.670
ANDREW SCHEPS: You wait
for the next song.

01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:53.250
OK.

01:12:53.250 --> 01:12:55.450
And this is technology-- these
guys, I mean, they probably

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:57.630
had meetings here, I don't know,
with anyone in the room.

01:12:57.630 --> 01:13:00.320
But originally, it's a few
guys from Singapore who

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.100
developed the technology.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:02.700
And they were hoping someone
else would just license it,

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:04.330
because they thought it was
awesome, and why wouldn't

01:13:04.330 --> 01:13:05.470
people want to do this?

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:08.750
So what they do is they're
pinging constantly, and the

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:10.560
bandwidth will change.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.830
And it plays back in HTML5
using a WebSocket, and it

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:18.300
plays back on iOS and Android
via an app, because MP4 SLS

01:13:18.300 --> 01:13:20.990
isn't supported directly
in the OS of

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:22.750
anybody's computer yet.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:28.150
So let me just quickly go
to my account here.

01:13:28.150 --> 01:13:30.630
And for audiophile people,
by the way, this

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:31.870
is an awesome service.

01:13:31.870 --> 01:13:35.750
So as a listener, it's like a
Dropbox that can stream your

01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:36.970
audio to you.

01:13:36.970 --> 01:13:39.260
So you can get a
free 1 gigabyte

01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.380
account, I think it is.

01:13:40.380 --> 01:13:41.910
Or you can pay $5 a
month for 5 gig.

01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:44.240
You can pay a little bit more
for 10 gig or 50 gig, or

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.160
something like that.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.990
You upload your lossless music
to the service, and you can

01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:52.450
immediately stream it anywhere
in the world on any platform.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:56.140
So it's their version
of a cloud iPod.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.980
But here is what it's
awesome about it.

01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:04.860
So let where are all
of my playlists?

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:13.320
Here, let's stream something
that's kind of--

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.570
oh, here we go.

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:18.050
Come on.

01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.710
OK, so I've got some of
the same songs here.

01:14:26.710 --> 01:14:29.100
But here's what's important is
see it right up at the top,

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.990
below the scroll.

01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.690
What do you call it?

01:14:31.690 --> 01:14:34.940
What's the official name for
that, the progress bar with

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:36.740
the thing in it?

01:14:36.740 --> 01:14:41.250
You know, it's the position
bar thing.

01:14:41.250 --> 01:14:43.570
OK, so watch what happens.

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:46.400
So everybody heard the song come
out from under the water,

01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.340
and start sounding good?

01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.530
Here's one that is not
a hi-fi recording.

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:53.600
Oh, this is a band from Austin
who are the most exciting show

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.700
I've ever seen.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:55.700
And I signed them to my label.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:57.070
They made a record
in two days.

01:14:57.070 --> 01:14:58.570
I mixed it in one day.

01:14:58.570 --> 01:15:02.180
It's psychedelic rock stuff.

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.470
It's not the most hi-fi
thing in the world,

01:15:03.470 --> 01:15:04.900
but this is at 96/24.

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.690
And again, just watch the bit
rate if you can see it.

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.940
So we're going to start off at
128 because there's a cache.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.830
OK, so we're just
streaming 96/24.

01:15:13.830 --> 01:15:16.060
And if you do the math and
figure out the bit rate, the

01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:18.630
number will always be a little
lower, because the last part

01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:20.910
of the decoding happens at the
WebSockets, so you don't

01:15:20.910 --> 01:15:23.650
actually need to give
the full bit rate.

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:28.840
So the drawback is if you
compare 256 stream from MP4SLS

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:34.310
to a 256 encoded MP3 or AAC, the
MP4SLS will not sound as

01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:37.540
good, because it's not optimized
for that bit rate.

01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:41.150
But I've never had to listen
to 256 with this.

01:15:41.150 --> 01:15:46.730
Wandering around on the 4G or 3G
that I get off AT&amp;T, I'm CD

01:15:46.730 --> 01:15:48.380
quality all the time.

01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.530
And as you go from the cell
network onto your

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:54.200
wi-fi, it jumps up.

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:57.000
And it's seamless, and
it works in real

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.720
time, and it's awesome.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.990
So this is another example of,
I think, where stuff can go

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.480
where you still get the
convenience of things having

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:06.770
to start playing immediately,
which I totally get.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:09.350
You don't want to start
streaming CD quality audio to

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:11.750
people on crappy cell
connections.

01:16:11.750 --> 01:16:14.480
But if you can hit Play
immediately, then realize

01:16:14.480 --> 01:16:16.800
they're not on a crappy cell
connection and be CD quality

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:20.290
within the first few bars of a
song, and when they jump on a

01:16:20.290 --> 01:16:23.810
wi-fi network, be up at
audio file quality,

01:16:23.810 --> 01:16:24.510
that's pretty cool.

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:26.740
So hopefully, this is
sort of where some

01:16:26.740 --> 01:16:27.650
things will get headed.

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:30.510
And it's one of many
possibilities.

01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:33.740
But if anyone's interested in
talking to the or guys, please

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:37.190
get in touch with me, because
they've set it up where now

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:40.440
it's a lockbox service for
people who want to just upload

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:41.360
their own stuff.

01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.300
I can sell my artists' albums
through there, download as

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:46.390
individual apps.

01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:49.020
So they have a business model,
but they're also always

01:16:49.020 --> 01:16:50.120
looking for partners.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.300
When Neil Young released his
last record, and everyone has

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:56.920
heard of the Pono system that
he's touting, which is a

01:16:56.920 --> 01:17:00.430
hardware-based high
res audio system?

01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:03.320
The Warner Brothers wanted to
stream his record for a week

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:05.440
before it came out, because
that's what record labels do

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.020
now is give you a free stream.

01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:09.250
And he said, yeah, that's fine,
as long as it streams at

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:14.720
192/24, which of course, that's
not going to happen.

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:17.940
So they got the or guys to do
it, and they actually did it.

01:17:17.940 --> 01:17:21.870
And they were streaming about
5 terabytes an hour all over

01:17:21.870 --> 01:17:23.430
the world of people who
wanted to listen.

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:26.000
And if they were on their mobile
browser, they were

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.580
probably getting maybe
CD quality.

01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.810
But if they were on a computer
hooked up to a stereo, they

01:17:30.810 --> 01:17:33.410
could listen to his
album at 192/24.

01:17:33.410 --> 01:17:36.430
And again, granularly scaling,
so if there's any little bit

01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:38.810
in the traffic, or if your buddy
starts streaming a movie

01:17:38.810 --> 01:17:41.900
down the hall, you granularly
dip, so it's

01:17:41.900 --> 01:17:42.770
not a stepping dip.

01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:45.130
So in terms of the listening
experience, it's a lot less

01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:47.500
intrusive, because you dip
down and come back up.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:48.300
Anyway, so that's OraStream.

01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:49.650
Yeah?

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:51.735
AUDIENCE: There's one form that
you haven't mentioned a

01:17:51.735 --> 01:17:52.110
single time.

01:17:52.110 --> 01:17:55.746
I was wondering [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:55.746 --> 01:17:56.130
DSD?

01:17:56.130 --> 01:17:59.980
ANDREW SCHEPS: OK, so DSD,
just really quickly, is

01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:03.080
basically 1 bit encoding
at a megahertz level.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.420
So instead of taking this grid
and putting it over, many,

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:10.790
many, many more times a second
then you would on a PCM

01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:12.375
encoding, you say, what's
the voltage?

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:14.260
Is it higher or lower
than last time?

01:18:14.260 --> 01:18:15.760
And you use your 1 bit--

01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.130
this is the dumb version--

01:18:17.130 --> 01:18:19.070
say, yeah, it's higher, it's
higher, it's higher, it's

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:19.920
higher, now it's lower,
it's lower.

01:18:19.920 --> 01:18:22.670
So you're basically tracing
the waveform very, very

01:18:22.670 --> 01:18:23.980
quickly as it goes.

01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:27.090
The only problem is-- the reason
I don't mention it is

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:30.970
because until about a week
ago, there was no viable

01:18:30.970 --> 01:18:31.950
consumer format.

01:18:31.950 --> 01:18:35.710
And now there is one site that
is actually selling DSD audio

01:18:35.710 --> 01:18:37.550
files that you can download.

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:40.460
And it's even more cumbersome
to get a player to work.

01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:44.150
Now in terms of audio quality,
listening to DSD versus high

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:47.730
res PCM encoding, I haven't
gotten to do A B test, but a

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:50.040
lot of people love it, think it
sounds absolutely amazing.

01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:53.150
It's a very different
way to encode music.

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.290
It's awesome.

01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:58.340
I try to only cover established
consumer formats

01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:01.800
during this, because that's
what's out there.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:03.970
And there's no way
I can distribute

01:19:03.970 --> 01:19:05.190
anything DSD right now.

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:06.260
It's impossible.

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:08.110
AUDIENCE: And it would be
hard for you to edit it

01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:09.230
ANDREW SCHEPS: It's
almost impossible.

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:12.170
There's one system that allows
you to do multi-track editing,

01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:14.310
and it's really expensive,
and their software sucks.

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:18.300
So I can edit, but it
would not be good.

01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:23.500
So again, obviously, there's
always the ability to work

01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.860
versus what would be best.

01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:31.282
