Hello. I’m Craig and this is Crash Course
Government and Politics and today we’re

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.540
going to turn to a topic that is near and
dear to our wallets at Crash Course: economics.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.219
Now, I know that dedicated fans are saying:
“Hold on Craigers, you have a whole series

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:20.639
about economics. Tell me about government.” To those
fans, I say: “you’re right…and don’t call me Craigers.”

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.500
But this episode is going to be about the
role that government plays in the economy,

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.700
specifically, the way that government creates the
market economic system that we know and love.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:36.520
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.660
Before I get into the ways that government
creates a market economy, let me be right

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.050
up front and say that we’re going to posit
that without some government, it wouldn’t

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.980
be possible for a market economy to exist.
[gasp] Whaaaaa?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.100
I realize that this is a bit controversial,
with many people believing that markets are

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.390
natural phenomena that follow laws like “supply
and demand” that are analogous to real physical

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.969
laws like, say, gravity. Which is also a movie
starring George Clooney - he aged so well.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:02.620
This is an interesting construct and one that
has important political ramifications, because

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.640
if you believe in it, then basically there’s nothing that the
government can, or should, do to improve the economy.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.580
I’ll leave it to commenters to argue this
point, but I stand by my statement:

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.820
We wouldn’t have a market economy
without government.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.280
So economically-minded political scientists,
AND politically-minded economists, will tell

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.509
you that there are a number of ways that government
structures the economy in the U.S. I’m going

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.369
to go over eight of them, although there might
be more.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.669
So, in no particular order, here it goes. The government
creates and maintains a market economy by:

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:27.289
establishing law and order;
defining rules of property;

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.869
governing rules of exchange;
setting market standards;

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.929
providing public goods;
creating a labor force;

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.500
ameliorating externalities; and
promoting competition.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.320
I think most of us can agree that a big part
of the government’s job is to establish

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.250
law and order. This idea goes back at least
as far as the Enlightenment and Thomas Hobbes,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.960
but since this is not Crash Course: Political
Philosophy, I’m going to move on.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.640
Law and order helps to structure the economy
by providing predictability.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.720
It is much harder to engage in trade or production
for profit if you suspect that what you have

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.180
to trade or sell may be taken away by bandits,
like the Hamburglar.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.140
But -- only -- in that case only if it’s
burgers that you are actually trading.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.970
But it’s not just that the government, if
it’s doing its job, can protect us from

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.259
being robbed in the literal sense of the Hamburgler
stealing our delicious, delicious burgers.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.139
The government creates a legal system that can punish
people who commit fraud, and knowing that they can

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.740
be punished prevents people from committing fraud.
Or at least I hope it does. Most of the time it does.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.060
Don’t do fraud kids. The second way that
the government structures the economy is by

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.220
defining rules of property. Now there are
many people who will tell you that property

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.730
is an inalienable right, sort of like something
given by God. I’m looking at you John Locke.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.340
And John Locke would respond, “don’t tell
me what I can’t do” but I would suggest that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.200
without government what you think of as your property
might not be as “yours” as you think or want it to be.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.780
But isn’t this sweet polka dot button-up
I’m wearing mine? Well, it is because I

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.750
paid for it and we have laws that say that
payment for a good confers a title to it – we

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.640
see this especially with land, or as it’s known to
the law as “real property” or perhaps “real estate.”

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.800
We don’t actually receive written titles
when we buy most things, but according to

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.770
the law, if I can establish ownership by proving
I paid for this shirt or somebody left it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.950
to me in their will or something then it’s
mine. And if someone takes it from me, I can

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.340
bring the law down on them - the courts, the legal
system, or maybe the sheriff will help me get it back.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.930
A really concrete example of the way the laws
create and protect property rights are trespass

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.100
laws, which allow you to tell those noisy
kids to get off your lawn. Without trespass,

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.890
who’s to say it’s not their lawn?

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.140
Basically ownership of anything is a bundle
of rights establishing what you can do with

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.170
that thing, whether it’s your car, or your
house, or your eagle. And without legally

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.330
established ownership rules, we can’t buy
or sell or punch anything.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.440
And speaking of buying and selling, another
way that the government structures the economy

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.820
is through setting and governing rules of
exchange. Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:28.800
In most states there are complex rules that
explain how and when, or even if you can sell

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.640
something. For example some localities, (like
Indiana) have so called “blue laws” that

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.200
prevent you from buying or selling alcohol
on certain days. Some counties in some states

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.670
are completely dry, meaning that you can’t
buy or sell alcohol at all, and for a brief

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.980
(terrible) period in the US – prohibition
– the Eighteenth amendment to the Constitution

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.480
prohibited the “manufacture, sale, or transportation
of intoxicating liquors” Manufacture, sale,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.770
and transportation, sound like the three main
ingredients in an economy to me.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.420
Some exchanges are still flat-out forbidden
by laws in the U.S.. Many drugs are called

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.160
controlled substances for a reason, and that
reason is that they are subject to government

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.920
control. Some drugs are prohibited outright
and if you make or sell or buy them you can

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.180
be punished by the government. There are also
laws preventing you from selling yourself

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.740
into slavery, or from selling your body through
prostitution, or selling parts of your body

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.060
like your kidneys. Some economists may question the
wisdom of these rules, but they exist and by making

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.320
and enforcing them the government can exert powerful
control over what can and cannot be exchanged.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.269
Thanks, Thought Bubble. Probably less controversial
than the rules governing exchange is the government’s

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.810
role in setting market standards.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.530
This is something governments have been doing
for a very long time, and you’ve probably

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.220
learned about it in history class as the government’s
setting up weights and measures.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.030
This may not seem like such a big deal until
you consider that if you are paying someone

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.620
for a pound of chick peas, you need to know
what a pound is...

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:37.380
if you’re going to get the right amount
for that sweet hummus.

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.160
This goes for measures too. If I am buying
an acre of land, I want to make sure that

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.400
I’m getting 4,046.86 square meters of land,
or 43,560 square feet. And if I buy an acre

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.570
in Scotland, I’m going to get even more
since a Scottish acre is the equivalent of

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:54.680
1.27 U.S. acres. Plus no one will look at
me funny when I’m eating my haggis.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.810
Basically this means is that the government
insures that buyers and sellers are operating

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.090
on the same playing field. This used to be
even more important when currency contained

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.070
precious metals, but I don’t want to get
into a big argument about pennies and nickels

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.750
-- that's John Green's thing, and we've all
established that I'm not John Green.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.810
This brings us to public goods. Public goods are
things and services that the government provides that

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.380
can be enjoyed by everyone and, once provided, cannot 
be denied to a particular subset of the population.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.120
One example is public transportation: in many
places the government provides bus or subway

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.120
services to residents, not for free, but at
highly subsidized costs, although if you’ve

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.260
ridden the New York Subway recently it doesn’t
always seem like the subsidies are big enough.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.090
In many cases the government steps in to provide
public goods when markets wouldn’t. It’s

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.660
not likely that private companies would provide
an air-traffic control system, and even if

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.110
they did, it would have to be highly regulated
by the government anyway because you don’t

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.700
want different cities and states enacting different
rules about air-travel. That would be a literal disaster.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.620
Also, if it were up to unregulated markets,
there wouldn’t be any flights to places

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.760
with small populations because they wouldn’t
be profitable.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.980
A really good example of the government providing
a public good where the market wouldn’t

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.750
step in is the rural electrification projects
of the New Deal, the most famous of which

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:56.380
sprang from the Tennessee Valley Authority.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.540
It wouldn’t have been profitable for power
companies to provide electricity to rural

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.510
towns and farms, so the government stepped
in and provided it. And since without electricity

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.380
it’s pretty hard to watch Crash Course,
I’m glad they did.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.440
We'd have to do, like, a Crash Course Live
Play.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:11.380
And I'm not good at live theater.

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.820
You might have heard that the government is
not a “job creator” and in some ways that’s

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.479
true, except for government jobs like firefighters
and public school teachers and, if we’re

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:21.699
talking the federal government, soldiers and
sailors. But there are other ways that government

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.199
efforts help to create a labor force.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.010
The main way this happens is through compulsory
education laws. States require that kids go

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:30.880
to school up to a certain age and this is to ensure,
or at least try to ensure, that when they

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.520
become adults they will have a level of competence
that will enable them to be productive workers.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.000
Of course, employers could provide the necessary
training at their own expense, but why would

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.720
they do it if the government provides it for
them?

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.200
Government also helps create the workforce by
providing student loans, which help people pay for college.

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.100
And that's why college is so easy to pay for
now.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.650
Right?
Wink.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.900
There are government-run training programs
and, I suppose, the potential for the government

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.150
to employ more people, like it did during
the Great Depression with programs like the

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.190
Works Progress Administration and the Civilian
Conservation Corps.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.420
Now if you’ll allow me to put on my economist’s
hat – Stan, do we have budget for an economist’s hat?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.620
No. Apparently economists wear very expensive
hats. I will try to explain what the government

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.290
does to ameliorate negative externalities. I love my
externalities ameliorated. Especially the negative ones.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.120
An externality is an external effect that
is a byproduct of a market transaction. They

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.639
can be positive or negative and can also be
seen as the difference between the private

00:07:20.639 --> 00:07:22.830
cost and the social cost of economic behavior.

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.000
Here’s an example. Driving is an economic behavior.
Back in the 1970s gasoline included lead, which

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.940
made engines run better but also polluted the air with
lead, which, as we now know is very bad. Very, very bad.

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:38.220
Buying leaded gasoline and running your car
on it was a private economic transaction but

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.920
air pollution was a very public cost that neither the
seller of the gasoline nor the purchaser had to pay.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.860
And air pollution was very costly in terms
of public health. So the government ameliorated

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.820
this by outlawing lead in gasoline and creating
regulations that limited air pollution generally.

00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:56.280
What this did was force companies and, by extension,
purchasers to pay for these negative external costs.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:08:00.660
Regulation is one way to deal with negative
externalities. Another is through taxes, which

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:02.150
we’ll deal with it in another episode.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.389
The last way that the government creates our
market economy, at least the last way I’m

00:08:05.389 --> 00:08:09.139
going to talk about, is by promoting competition.
According to our old friend Adam Smith, the

00:08:09.139 --> 00:08:12.900
essence of a functioning market system is
competition, and in a perfect world competition

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.620
would ensure that people got the best products
at the best prices.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.640
But history has shown that corporations and
individuals have often tried to stifle competition

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:23.449
and create monopolies. If there’s only one
firm selling a product, that firm can charge

00:08:23.449 --> 00:08:27.289
whatever it wants, and this monopoly
condition doesn’t usually benefit consumers.

00:08:27.289 --> 00:08:29.580
At least not as much as it benefits monopolists.

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:33.539
So government can and has stepped in to create
laws to regulate monopolies. The best known

00:08:33.539 --> 00:08:37.219
of these are the anti-trust laws, which are
sometimes used against big corporations, like

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.780
Standard Oil or more recently, Microsoft.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:43.380
And the government can also grant anti-trust
exemptions that allow monopolies, as it did

00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:47.040
for Major League Baseball. Either way, the
government, under the Commerce Clause in the

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:51.059
Constitution can pass laws that promote or
inhibit competition, although usually it tries

00:08:51.059 --> 00:08:53.759
to make the marketplace more, rather than
less, competitive.

00:08:53.759 --> 00:08:57.809
So that's why I say the government has a big
role to play in making a free market economy.

00:08:57.809 --> 00:09:02.560
You may not be convinced that without government a
free market system wouldn’t be possible, and that’s ok.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.300
You can think what you want. It's a free market.
