Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:04          joining me today is the founding editor of Colette clearly made welcome to the Rubin report.

Speaker 3:          00:09          Thanks Dave. Thanks for having me.

Speaker 2:          00:10          I am thrilled to finally have you here. This has been like what, 87 years in the making, right? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:16          Well I live a very long way away, so it's difficult for me to get here.

Speaker 2:          00:20          Yeah, well you made it, you made it thousands of miles. You are part of what I would say is IDW Australia, I suppose. Spora yeah, exactly. Um, okay, so there's a ton I want to talk to you about. Obviously I want to focus on Colette and the work that you're doing and we obviously have a lot in common on the issues that we care about and things of that nature. But first off, you are from Australia. I've only had I think a two other guests that are Australian natives on the show. Yeah. What's going on in Australia these days? What, what does the rest of the world need to know about Australia?

Speaker 3:          00:51          I would say that in Australia were pretty chilled out at the moment, at least politically and culturally compared to America. And even Europe to a large extent, we have a, we've had, um, 25 years or more of economic growth. So people are pretty relaxed. People are doing well, the middle class is doing well. Um, there's not so much of a feeling that is a zero sum competition going on. Like people are fighting over scarce resources and you know, we obviously have political correctness and identity politics. Um, a lot of that's being imported from America.

Speaker 2:          01:28          Yeah. And how does that get imported? Because I was mentioning to you right before we started that a disproportionate amount of our patrons, the people who support the show or Australia. Yeah. So even if things are going pretty well, there's definitely a segment of people that are going, something's either not right or where we're seeing the science. That's something coming.

Speaker 3:          01:45          Yeah, it's true. I mean, it's difficult to identify exactly how these cultural trends get imported. But, um, for example, through universities, through social media, through traditional medium, so similar narratives get picked up by journalists like the oppression, narratives and, um, and we're seeing with the, with the young, younger generations how they're, how they pick up ideology through social media and through the echo chambers and the filter bubbles that are so easily accessible. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:22          Do you think that there's a geographic reason that some of this stuff hasn't fully hit Australia yet? I mean, being surrounded by water and a place from the rest of us, there's probably a little bit of safety in that I would imagine. Although borders are changing just because of technology.

Speaker 3:          02:38          Yeah. It's um, yeah, so we are more isolated, that's for sure. Where smaller. Um, so we don't have the same, we're not as diverse as other places like Europe and the United States. Um, we have less income inequality in Australia, which makes a difference. And, um, well we're actually kind of parochial as well. I mean, we do pick up cultural trends from America, but at the same time we just focus on cooking shows and reality TV and football games.

Speaker 2:          03:13          Yeah. Yeah. So when the article came out back in was it may or so the renegades of the intellectual dark web, you were included in there and many of us had not even met you. Yeah. This is actually our first time meeting in person. Yeah. Even though we've been chatting online for awhile. Um, were you shocked about the reaction to that article because it really did sort of level up all of the issues that we've been all talking. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:40          no, no, I wasn't shocked at all. I think that the general movement, this ideas movement and this push back of the, the sort of moral orthodoxy that the politically correct left have at the moment. It's been brewing for some time and someone just had to put a label on it. Someone just had to name it. And um, I wasn't shocked by the groundswell of reaction to it because I've been seeing it through my work with Colette. There are just so many people who write to me every day who say, I love what you're doing. I can't, um, write a blog myself account, put my name on it because I would get in trouble at work or in my university where there are so many people who, um, want to participate in these discussions but can't for whatever reason. And um, you know, they liked it to be now be able to put a label on this general movement.

Speaker 2:          04:40          Yeah. So tell me a little bit about your personal background. What led you to be one of the people that is okay. Putting your name on this stuff because I do think that's one of the huge issues here. Yeah. We get all this support from academics. Yeah. Even people in politics and, and regular folks who were like, yeah, I'm with Ya. And I see the dangers, but I don't want to put my name money then. So how did Claire Lehman ended up here? Uh, willing to put your name and faced all this stuff?

Speaker 3:          05:05          You know, I, I think I have bit more of a risk taking streak in my nature and I don't feel the same fear around social disapproval as a lot of other people. Um, so I was a psychology graduate student and I left my Grad program and before I left I sort of, um, uh, took a few risks during, during my program and, and we're sort of hung out to dry by the university, so to speak.

Speaker 2:          05:38          Yeah. Do you want to give me an example of one of those, you sort of lit up when you said it?

Speaker 3:          05:43          Well, I, I complained about the amount of unpaid work that psychology students had to do in a clinic that was associated with the university and they weren't happy with that. And I sort of received a bit of, for sort of almost whistle blowing on the amount of exploitation this clinic was involved in. So I've always said on the first time I took a risk, um, I've always taken risks when I've had felt that my conscience demands that I do so. And what led me to create Colette was, um, when I was a graduate student, I was involved in a lot of online discussions with academics in psychology. And we had such fascinating, interesting discussions that were completely unlike anything that you would see in mainstream media. And I thought, firstly, there's a business opportunity here if I can bring some of these conversations to a market. And secondly, you know, people need to know that there are, there is scientific evidence and some of these topics and mainstream journalists on and neglecting to, um, inform readers about some of these issues or some of some of this evidence.

Speaker 2:          07:00          Yeah. So I want to read the mission statement from Colette Cause it's, it's pretty freaking perfect. Colette is a platform for free thought. We respect ideas, even dangerous ones. We also believe that free expression and the free exchange of ideas help human societies flourish and progress. Colette aims to provide a platform for this exchange. Everybody seems to be afraid of dangerous ideas right now. Right? I mean that's why this little crew of people are together for whatever our differences are.

Speaker 3:          07:32          Yeah. I think that there's a, there's been a conflation between giving a platform or exploring ideas and endorsing ideas and they're not the same thing. So I will publish stuff on Colette that I don't necessarily agree with politically. Um, I don't see the fact of publishing and, uh, necessarily as an endorsement. I also, um, am very clear that I'm going to make mistakes as an editor. I'm Colette, we don't want to make mistakes about accuracy. And if we're ever called out for publishing something that's not factually correct, we will own up to that mistake. But you know, we're living in a time of intense ideological flux and to work out where we're all going, we need to be able to talk about things freely and we need to be able to make mistakes. And I think make, being able to make mistakes is a sign of a healthy environment and it's a sign of, you know, it's part of the creative process. Yeah. Um, so the, the, the, the warriors who want to shut down debate, who want to shut down free speech and um, argue that giving a platform for exploring dangerous ideas is equivalent to endorsing them. They're basically that you can't make a mistake. And that's, that's really scary because the only way we move forward is to experiment, test new ideas, see, see what works and pick the best ones out of the, the experimentation process and move forward that way.

Speaker 2:          09:11          Yeah. So I want to discuss some of the dangerous ideas. Yeah. Or that your platform, but it's interesting that you said this thing about you don't mind making mistakes because I feel very much the same. I will sit down with all sorts of people. I've done it before, people I agree with and disagree with some people who I really don't like what they're talking about. But I try to give everybody a fair shake. And what I'm noticing is there's a tremendous amount of pushback just on that. That's what you're getting to. Like the idea that a, you can sit down with someone in separate, a human being, mm. From their ideas, but also that there's this sort of secondary thing that I'm noticing. And I think you, you get it too, just from the articles you guys put out, which is that if I don't ask the exact question that someone wants me to ask or I miss this or I word this this way, but just this, this army that doesn't feel that organic to me is ready to pounce. And I'm really trying to work through that. Like I don't spend too much time thinking about it, but it is a conscious thing like, oh, there's going to be this group of people that no matter what I do and really what they're trying to do is chill everybody out so that you'll only talk about what they're comfortable with it.

Speaker 3:          10:16          Yeah. Well, there are, there are people at the moment who feel that all of the important questions have been answered. All of the important moral and ethical dilemmas have an answer. And that at this point in history, everything's been worked out. And anyone who's, um, exploring different ideas or is doubtful about these moral issues is evil.

Speaker 2:          10:45          You're part of the Archi. You're racist. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          10:47          yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so I come, I come from a different approach where like I don't know what's going on. Like I, I'm trying to work it out with other people and, um, I want the freedom to be able to explore

Speaker 2:          11:02          in a weird way. Does that get you the most hate? Cause I think I really believe that's where most people are. I think that's why people appreciate what I do here. I'm just being open about my journey and listening to people and learning and all of that. Yeah, yeah. And that, but that opens you up from hate, from the both sides. It's a lot easier to just stake out a position and then you'll only get heat one way. But when you're like, I am going to hear both sides, you know, it's why I love listening to Sam Harris and Jordan Peterson debate. Yeah. You know, the biggest existential questions that there are. It's like, yeah, it's like, if I've completely settled my mind on this, I don't know. I wouldn't be that impressed with my thought process or something.

Speaker 3:          11:38          Yeah. Well, you know, I don't get a lot of Hay. Um, I certainly have Twitter trolls, but,

Speaker 2:          11:44          well, wait til we post. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          11:47          Um, I sort of don't really notice it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          11:51          That's probably the most simple to deal with this. All right. So let's, let's talk about some of those dangerous ideas. What are some dangerous ideas that have bubbled up from your writers that you've had to think about or that you're, you're focused on these days?

Speaker 3:          12:04          Yeah, so because my background is in psychology, um, we tackle issues that come from the behavioral sciences. So we've looked at sex differences, um, psychological sex differences between men and women, um, differences in interests in occupations. Um, so we've published some articles on why there are fewer women in computer science, for example. And, um, we published a analysis of Jameson DeMaurice Google memo written by four different scientists who have some expertise in that area. Uh, we've published on intelligence Reese.

Speaker 2:          12:47          Well, what were some of the results of,

Speaker 3:          12:50          yeah, well they, you know, they basically said that something pretty similar that he was in the ballpark in terms of getting the science right and his position is valid in terms of regular scientific debate. There are observable sex differences between men and women. The differences in interests in occupations is very robust and reliable. So women are overwhelmingly interested in occupations which have something to do with people. So caring professions, medicine, even law. Whereas men have more interest in occupations that are to do with systems and things. So anything mechanical, computer science and there's no, there's no difference between the average intelligence scores between men and women. And the evidence around differences in verbal and mathematical ability is somewhat mixed. I mean you can, you can have debates backwards and forwards over the strengths of those differences, but the difference in interest is very robust.

Speaker 2:          14:00          Why are people so afraid of that? Why is it that there is a set of people out there right now that want us to act to be all equal in their minds, but it would actually force us to go against nature? I mean that's what, that's what this really is.

Speaker 3:          14:17          Well there is a fear that if you acknowledge that there are differences between individuals or groups that you're saying that one group is inferior. So there's been a co like the idea that we have to be the same to be equal has been a very prevalent and strong idea. I don't know who came where the idea comes from. Right. But it's, it's, um, it's dangerous because if you, um, if you argue that no true or quality can be achieved, unless we're all the same, then no, then we can't have a quality. Yeah. However, if you argue that no, we're all morally equal and that we deserve equal opportunity and, uh, the equal, um, uh, w we deserve equal opportunities to live a happy, flourishing life. However, there are differences between us. Yeah. Then you can preserve that, um, ethical principle. So it's very problematic for people who think that there can be no equality between men and women unless we are proven to be the same identical. Um, because the evidence doesn't support the idea that we're the same. Yeah. What are, what are some of the other dangerous ideas? Okay. So we've,

Speaker 2:          15:44          we're doing the dangerous role. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          15:46          yeah, yeah. Um, we've published work on intelligence research, which is controversial. Uh, we've published articles about

Speaker 2:          15:55          Harris Intelligence. Are you talking about intelligence and race?

Speaker 3:          15:58          Um, cause this seems to be one that people seem to be all that's, yeah, that's a hugely controversial issue. And uh, we've published, um, we published a defense of the Charles Murray's the bell curve because after he had his conversation with Sam Harris, vox came out and wrote a hit piece. Yeah. Or right at some, some kind of article that misrepresented what they talked about and the bell curve. And so we published a response from Professor Richard Hire, who's the editor of the intelligence journal. So he's a preeminent expert in this area. And he defended Charles Murray's book and defended the conversation that they had and said, this is a important issue. It's scientifically valid and has merit to talk about these issues. And they got, they were, they got the science right. Um, so we, we don't aim to be provocative for the sake of just being inflammatory, right? We, we have an objective where we want to protect the scientists who have, who are doing this work or who are having these competent conversations. We want us, we want to protect the individuals who are doing the knowledge production or the research. We want to protect them from the boxes and the journalists who just want to write hate pieces just to get the clicks. So we have a, a sort of a commitment to those people who are doing risky work and need that kind of protection.

Speaker 2:          17:42          You're going to my soft spot today because as, as we're taking this only as we're taping this, only like an hour ago, vox did a piece me about how I'm part of the reactionary, right? Yeah. Something and it's just like, you guys are just awful. So in a weird way, your, your, your job in some respect has become sort of like a force field to just allow people to do the work that they're supposed to be doing.

Speaker 3:          18:05          Yeah, that's right. Because universities for all sorts of different reasons are neglecting their duty to academic freedom. Right. And academic freedom is meant to exist to protect scientists in particular who are doing work, which contradicts the religious orthodoxy of the time or the moral orthodoxy in. It's quite clear to me that there are scientists doing work which challenges politically correct dogmas and I don't see universities doing a very good job at protecting those scientists. And so we feel like we can fill the gap.

Speaker 2:          18:47          Where, where do you think the gender studies stuff fits into all this? Because in a weird way it seems like it's all being widdled down to that somehow that now, especially related to trans issues, I was just talking to a fairly well known public professor yesterday off the record. Yeah. About how he's going into his old, even though he's factually correct and it's calm, you know, confident about his research. He's going into old lesson plans to change wording just because he doesn't want to deal with the mob. So things that were completely acceptable three, four years ago is now having to edit out. I mean that's, that's truly dangerous. So what is going on with the gender studies department and the rest of this? It's all about

Speaker 3:          19:29          moving so fast. It's hard to really, um, to analyze what's going on when it's shifting so fast. But certainly, um, many of the humanities departments took a turn back in the 1970s and they took the, um, took on these fashionable theories such as poststructuralism and uh, they, they rejected empirical methods. Um,

Speaker 2:          19:58          and so when the argument, if we were trying to give them the credit yeah. That they're due, at least in the argument, if you're, yeah, if you're rejecting empirical science or verbal back, what is your argument that leads you there? Cause I looked at their watches. Go next judge just sounds crazy, but they obviously believe it. So let's try to give the devil his deal. Right? Yeah. So

Speaker 3:          20:16          postmodernists have a good point and that is that we are all biased and a scientist looking at an issue such as, um, sexuality has his or her own biases. Right? And so the questions that the scientists are asks when he, oh, he or she is designing a survey or designing a lab experiment, I go in and have some bias embedded within them that, so that's true. And the postmodern has had that insight. However, the mistake they make is getting rid of a PR empirical and objective methods altogether and just saying, because we're biased, what's the point? Right?

Speaker 2:          20:58          So they're doing like a massive over correction.

Speaker 3:          21:01          Yes, yes. Yeah. When, when what should be done is acknowledging, yes, we all have our bias. Um, and if I'm a scientist designing a study, I'm going to have my bias and it might get embedded into the work that I'm doing. However, there are ways to correct that and we want to improve our quantitative methodologies in order to correct for our own biases to the problem that the postmodern is have is that they say, well, the bias is there, so let's put it all in the Bin and we're just going to double down on the bias and just talk about lived experience. I mean that it's just taking the completely the wrong direction.

Speaker 2:          21:39          Right? I mean it's quite literally the reverse of the scientific method. Yeah, so basically they're saying that that bias is truth, right? I mean, if you're saying bias that the lived experience is what truth is, then bias is truth. You know, I don't know if you saw, but I did this, this talk at University of New Hampshire and this woman was yelling at me, this trans woman calling me all right, and all of this other nuts and shouting me down. I didn't realize this until two months later or something, but it turned out she was a gender studies professor at the school. Yeah. So you've got a gender studies professor trying to shout down an invited speaker while live tweeting that I'm all right or whatever. And it's like, I'm pretty sure maybe I'm not right about everything. I'll concede on that even though I want it. I said she should be treated with respect and equality and all that. But your biased that you're acting on right now definitely is not closer to truth than anything I was saying.

Speaker 3:          22:29          Yeah. So I, the way I think of it ease that you know, there is an objective reality and the way we get to objective reality is through the scientific method. Um, whereas postmodernists academics believe a lot of them believe that reality's created through language and discourse. And I think that's one of the reasons why they believe that words can be violence. Because if reality is actually created through language and discourse and there's, um, some kind of, there's some toxic discourse than they truly believe that reality can be changed through words. And so I think that's why they get so upset about freedom of speech and just having discussions because they truly believe that words can change the way the world is constructed.

Speaker 2:          23:21          Right? So for now they say it's okay to punch a Nazi, will they call everybody Nazis, then it's okay to punch a Nazi and then we can go however far down that road we want to go. And then, yeah, then you're completely condoning minds. How concerned are you that these ideas are going to trickle up higher into places of power and that once they look, we know they're in the media, you've already mentioned VOCs and a couple of those other, um, but that once they're really in the places of power in Australia or in the states or wherever else, that the screws are really gonna be turned against us because yeah, we're fighting for free speech.

Speaker 3:          23:57          Yeah. I'm mostly be concerned about these ideas getting into the law. Traditionally the lore is a conservative field and they are pretty good at resisting political fads. But you can see with the way that law is taught in law schools at the moment that there is critical legal studies and often critical legal studies is a mandatory component. So they teach like the feminist interpretation of law and these approaches, um, can undermine some of the basic, uh, fundamentals and foundations of how the law is meant to work. So I, yeah, I am worried that there are a lot of attacks on droop due process at the moment, freedom of speech and the scientific method. Those three things are foundations of a civilized society and all of them are being attacked at the moment.

Speaker 2:          24:59          Yeah. How does me to fit into this because you've been, you've been somewhat critical of that. I think it gets all three of those criteria that you just lay it out. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          25:07          Look, you know, obviously me to started as a really legitimate and um, power for movement in identifying the, the predations that Harvey Weinstein was engaged in. And, and surely there are, there have been many powerful men, um, in the last couple of decades working in industries where there's a lot of young women around and they have positions of power and they, they're able to exploit those positions. But, you know, I'm a young woman myself, right? And I, I don't see sexual harassment, um, as being, as pervasive as a lot of people claim. And, uh, I also think it's very dangerous to make accusations against people publicly because our reputations are so valuable and so important that, um, you know, we, we need to respect other people's ability to have, have their, their reputation and um, making accusations in public sort of goes against my, um, my feeling that it feels vindictive to me and it feels dangerous, dangerous path to go down because for every true accusation there is of sexual harassment, there's going to be someone who is, um, you know, there's, there are going to be people who have conflicts and then the conflict, someone feels like they can resolve a conflict through making an accusation of sexual harassment.

Speaker 3:          26:41          And that's really scary. We don't don't want people to resolve their conflicts by making public accusation.

Speaker 2:          26:47          Right. But I definitely think there's a certain set of people that don't mind collateral damage. Right? I mean that seems to be what's happening right now. And people you see this public, people that are tweeting these kinds of things, like it doesn't matter if you're in a safe down a couple of ladies and people. That's how dangerous this thing is. That strikes me is far more dangerous and I'm not belittling any of the actual yeah. Things that some of these women have gone through.

Speaker 3:          27:08          Yeah, it's scary. It's the, uh, desire for collective punishment and that collective punishment is, is, is scary. It, if you look at the Geneva Convention that was established after World War II, the UN declared collective punishment a war crime. So the idea is that when there is a conflict between ethnic groups in certain places, if, if one, if some people are killed in that, in a conflict, you can't then go on. Wife had a village as a collective collective, retro retribution because that's how these war crimes happen. So now where this, um, lucky said this collateral damage, this desire for collateral damage is being normalized. Like people don't seem to understand how dangerous this is and how unjust it is.

Speaker 2:          28:08          What is, is part of the issue that perhaps they do understand it, but they so want to destroy the system. This is, you know, I a, I've been on tour with Jordan Peterson. One of the things he's been talking about a lot lately is yes, you can acknowledge that we don't have perfect systems and then there's perfect systems are probably impossible to ever get to. But now we have this new thing in the system, which is let's just freaking destroy the whole thing to build our perfect system.

Speaker 3:          28:33          Yeah. I think people don't understand because, um, we're not taught anymore. We're not taught history properly. We're not, we don't learn about human nature in school and how it's almost an instinct to want to desire retribution, retribution and vindictive justice. I think it's, it's part of our nature is to want to punish people and punish groups, um, and our institutions like a due process and the presumption of innocence, they sort of, they go against our instincts, but that's why they're thankfully. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And I think what we're seeing is just sort of like a regression back to our more tribal instinctive nature. And because our education system is so atrophy [inaudible] young people aren't being taught the value and the fragility of these institutions, how they came about, why they're so important and why we must protect them. So then I think there's just that basic ignorance about why these institutions, institutions exist in the first place and then we're regressing to our more primitive natures.

Speaker 2:          29:43          Yeah. How do you think social media fits into this? Because it's, I did a video, I think it's almost three years ago now, that online culture is becoming mainstream culture. And I think that that's what we're seeing now, what used to be just relegated to the meme makers and the pet bay people has now just leaked everywhere. And just everyone in, in public is acting sort of as their worst selves all the time. And then that feeds all of this. Let's either destroy the system or let's ignore legitimate problems.

Speaker 3:          30:11          Well, when you don't have proper law and order, you do get mob justice in vigilante justice in real life. And you can see that throughout history you've got, you get lynchings. Um, you get pogroms, um, you get groups like mobs of people going and attacking an individual who they think is guilty of like a sex crime or some other crime and killing the person. So, and then what happened was, is we develop legal and social norms that stopped that kind of vigilante justice from taking place. And if you are a vigilante, you can just, you can get in trouble with the law. And then we've developed social norms that prevent people from just forming mobs and going attacking people in the street. But social media is this new technology and we don't, haven't developed any of the legal or social norms yet. And so it's brought back this mobbing behavior, which is part of our nature. It's brought it back. But we haven't yet developed any of the norms to sort of suppress it or mitigate against it. Yeah. And I think we eventually will develop these norms, but it's gonna take awhile and there's going to be a fee innocent people sort of metaphorically lynched in the process.

Speaker 2:          31:24          Yeah. So that's actually an interesting segue to something that's been on my mind lately. So, you know, Alex Jones got booted from Twitter and Youtube and Facebook or whatever. I don't even want to talk about any of the things that he talks about. It does not matter, but, but these tech companies basically decided that this one guy is too dangerous. You know, Farah can can be on here and Hamas, whoever you, whoever else you want to pick that you don't like can be on here. But this guy, you know, even paypal took them out last week. Um, do you think that the free speech crew for getting his ideas, do you think we should have offered a better defense of why this person, boat person should be allowed to use these things? I mean, should the guy be allowed to make a phone call? Should he allow it? Should he be allowed to have running water at his house? Yeah. Where do we draw the lines for this?

Speaker 3:          32:11          Yeah. Well I think these tools, uh, that we use such as payment processing and social media such as Twitter, the instant messaging, the, the tools, and they should be treated as, as such, like having electricity or water. And um,

Speaker 2:          32:28          so you believe there are public good, basically the same. Yeah. Getting water to your house, getting the phone line connected to your house.

Speaker 3:          32:34          Yeah. And, and they shouldn't be politicized. And as soon as you politicize these tools, then it's, there's a slippery slope and you know, then there's going to be arguments about who do we band next, what standards do we want to sit and that kind of thing. And in the context of Alex Jones, I, I, I think there's probably more to the story that the public is aware of, so I don't want to comment on him specifically.

Speaker 2:          33:01          Yeah. And I don't want to make it a bit, yeah, just the general idea that a digital assassination can occur because we're all agreeing to terms of services that I'm not sitting around with a lawyer every time I click except to the new service. Yeah. And that eventually you could move on anybody, you know what I mean? We know the way these ideas work. You don't get one person and then suddenly be like, oh well we're good to go. It's like who do you get neck?

Speaker 3:          33:24          Yeah. And the PA, the payment processing is, is scary. I mean, the idea that that should be politicized is just, that is crazy.

Speaker 2:          33:33          Yeah. Hmm. So what do you think the solution is? I mean, I think you probably know my, my solution is that we need more competition, but I'm, I'm really understanding of big counter to that because it's like where is the county? Where is it?

Speaker 3:          33:46          Yeah. No, look, I don't have the answer. And I tend towards being, um, uh, economically liberal. However, some of these tools, as you said, are public goods and perhaps need to be thought of as public widget rather than rather than private. And um, you know, I'm not, I'm open to ideas and regulation, government intervention and um, and I'm also open to ideas about breaking up some of the monopolies because we, competition would be lovely, but it's a bit difficult at the moment because some of these companies have gotten monopolies in lots of different verticals. So Google for example, has the search engine monopoly they've got that almost got the advertising monopoly, so they're leveraging their monopoly in one area into others. And that that just shuts down competition.

Speaker 2:          34:44          Yeah. Do you think it's even something a little more perverse than that, which is that, you know, look, there's obviously I'm not a blow the lid on anything here. There's obviously tons of discussions with all sorts of people about how do we compete with youtube or how do we compete with any of these things? Yeah. But I think partly what's happening, it's not just people who are going there, this, this big monolith. I think people are actually genuinely afraid of what it means to go up against them. It's not like it's going to just be a hard work situation. It's like, what does it actually mean to go up against the world's information leader, come

Speaker 3:          35:14          compete against the monopoly. That's the definition of a monopoly. There's no competition. And these, some of these companies are monopolies and they have captured the market so effectively that you cannot compete with them. And so we either have to think about regulating them so that they're free and open to everybody or, um, breaking up their

Speaker 2:          35:38          ability to control the market. I mean, yeah. Yeah. This is the tough part for the Libertarian Board. He was like, no, don't do it yet. I do send some being pinned into, yeah, that, that kind of answer

Speaker 1:          35:50          [inaudible].
