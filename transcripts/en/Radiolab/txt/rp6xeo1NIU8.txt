Speaker 1:          00:00          Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radiolab and this whole hour we have been talking about, go ahead. Guts, guts. In the last section we talked about bacteria and the armies of them that are in your gut. You know the problem is that they're a little hard to picture kind of abstract. Oh, why don't we finish with a story that makes the whole issue real and much more concrete. This is the tail of a troubled relationship between a man and his on again, off again, gut. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello man. His name's John Reiner. He's a writer, lives here in New York. So one day you are eating your way through your life as you usually do. And then things take an odd turn. Yeah. How did it, how did it begin? It began with, the surprise is at home and I was about to go make myself a tuna fish sandwich.

Speaker 1:          00:50          John Thought, you know what, let me go to the bathroom first to get that out of the way. So he sits down on the pot to do his business. And I felt a funny twinge in my gut. Now John has had gut pain before. I suffer from something called Crohn's disease, which is a gastrointestinal condition. But I had gone through a period of about a year, his remission, excellent health. And so when this pain came on, John figured no big deal. It seemed to come out of nowhere and I thought it'll go away out of nowhere, like usual, but it didn't.

Speaker 2:          01:20          Within about a minute, what was a small twinge all of a sudden felt like a knife into my gut before long, I'm on my living room floor, flat on my back and I can't move. John calls an ambulance, they rushed him to the hospital and when they get there, the doctors take one look and tell him your intestines were clock and now they burst

Speaker 1:          01:42          and it's now spreading bacteria throughout your system. Basically you're on the verge of having Sepsis, meaning you could die. So you need emergency surgery. But they also told them that I should recover. And when he came out of the oir look like he would, but the doctor said, let's play it safe. Stay here for a week. We'll feed you through an IV and give your gut a break. So I'm on an IEP for a couple of days and I've been on nothing by mouth in the hospital numerous times before, but always for four to five days. And after four or five days, John says, what normally happens is that you'll start to feel hungry again. That's a great sign. That means that your gut is healing and it's ready for food. But this time that didn't happen. In fact, he says he got sicker, nausea, vomiting, chills, fever, spike.

Speaker 1:          02:29          So the doctors take more pictures of John's insights and they noticed something weird in the area where I had the tear in my intestine. There is no a Fistula, which is a hole. And normally this is something you could so right back up, the doctors tell them in your case, no, the tissue of around the area of the tear so compromised that you can't withstand another surgery right now. Plus you've got high level of infection. Again, you're no candidate for surgery or only solution they tell them is to let gut heal on its own. But in order to do that, we've got to shut it down. Yes, basically numb it with anesthesia. So my gut was in an induced coma.

Speaker 2:          03:08          Nothing would pass through it. There'd be no activity, which meant the doctors told them obviously no eating. Instead we're going to put you on a food pump and the food pump is a mechanical pump about the size and the weight of two bricks carry carrying in the backpack and the pump in the backpack is attached to this big bag. Big Bladder. The big 3000 milliliter bag of a TPN is the medical name for the nutrients visits and for total parent Terrell nutrition and and stream runs out of the pump through the tube into my arm. You are going to be given essentially a a an outdoor stomach. That's right.

Speaker 1:          03:48          And this is where our story really begins. So John goes home with his new XO, stomach canny, but every day around mealtime he says he would turn on the food. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          04:02          And this is actually what it sounds like. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:12          so, uh, I'd start my feeding at four o'clock. Pump would start, I'd sit on the love seat for awhile and my kids would come home from school, my wife would come home from teaching and then the real food would come into the apartment. Sometimes neighbors brought food over. Sometimes John's wife would cook regardless. I was always sitting on the love seat in our living room with the food pump worrying like a dishwasher while just a few feet away. His family would sit at the table, uh, eating fabulous food night after night. This happens and it's making me absolutely crazy. And he says, after about a week of this, and then two weeks and then three weeks of just sitting there night after night watching his family eat dinner without him, he says he would start to drift off

Speaker 1:          05:00          and get lost to these really vivid daydreams of meals that he'd eaten in the past. One of the first memories I have is going to Katz's for the first time. Ladies and gentlemen, please. Getz is a famous Jewish Jelly in Manhattan. Oh, how are you doing? Good. All right. We're going along and standing there at the counter. We must be right where the counter man cuts the Pastrami and puts it on a plate and it cuts it out of the hot cooker and it's on a fork and he hands it to you and you take a taste. And he says, in that particular instance, when he took a bite, that first bite of the astronomy sandwich, it was like, he said, it was the first time in his life where he suddenly, he was like, Oh my God, I'm Jewish. I am Jewish. She's there. My people.

Speaker 2:          05:44          That was the first time you felt that it was. It was. And after about a month of no food at all, and these vivid daydreams about food, something happened.

Speaker 4:          05:58          John got Hungry, like actually hungry, which really doesn't make much sense because hunger signals normally travel from the gut up to the brain, and his gut was numb. But he says, he really started to feel hungry. It was, you know, I think of it, it was an existential hunger and he got really bad. For example, uh, my wife's a terrific cook and one night she made a, a little treat for the kids, uh, mini burgers and French fries and our small apartment smelled like the kitchen of a white castle. So, um, my wife brought out this big plate of sliders in a pyramid and the kids were knocking down the pyramid and throwing the back and I couldn't take it anymore. So I snuck out of the living room while they were preoccupied, I went into our kitchen and there were some fries on the stove top and I put my hand on the fries and I brought them up to my mouth and I was expecting salt and oil, fatty goodness, fatty goodness and the texture of crunchiness and all that.

Speaker 4:          07:03          And I'm tasting it now and I put it on my tongue and I've got nothing, nothing really, and I'm rolling it around and options, you can't even feel it on my tongue. Feels even the salt. It's like when you go to the dentist and you've got novacane and really, and my tongue is numb at a roll. So I start at your tone, just out of practice. I couldn't figure out what's going on. And then I brought up a knife and John claims that when he looked at the reflection of his tongue in this metal knife, I see that my tongue is as flat and smooth as this for Micah tabletop. I've got my hand on. And you're still saying you don't have the little a personally no bristles. Right. And I realize I haven't used it in so long that my taste buds have evaporated. You know, they're gone. And at the moment that that happens, my oldest son, teddy, who was nine at the time, comes in and he says, Dad, you're not supposed to eat. I said to him, I wasn't eating, I wasn't eating. It's like you switch places almost. And he looked at me with the most scornful disgusted, just ashamed expression. And I was completely humiliated. I normally failed as neater. Shame flood. Right? I failed as a father as well.

Speaker 5:          08:20          Uh Huh

Speaker 6:          08:23          [inaudible].

Speaker 7:          08:23          As the weeks dragged on and John didn't get any better, he actually started to take that thought seriously. Like maybe he really was failing at being a dad. I'm a stay at home dad and uh, as a result, I'm the shopper and the cooker and the food planner and the provider for us. And I was out of commission three years out of work with no gut. Meanwhile, I can't stop thinking about food. I'm remembering and

Speaker 4:          08:51          food that I ate 20 years ago. Like I had it out that afternoon. And I'm online looking up menus from restaurants that I've gone to and looking up recipes, you know, for, for dishes that I've made.

Speaker 7:          09:04          Obsession grew and grew until one night he says his neighbor Marsha,

Speaker 4:          09:08          I decided to cook for us one night when I wasn't eating and she brought down a chocolate Bundt cake for that. My wife and kids to eat walks it right past John on the way to the kitchen. And I could smell this thing, I could smell the rum, I could smell the eggs, I can smell the flower, I could smell everything. So again, he sneaks into the kitchen and I lower my nose down to this bunk cake and I'm smelling it and I'm sniffing it. And I'm inhaling this thing like an anteater and that's not enough in my state, so I plunge my hands into the chocolate cake. You what? I lunge my hand into the chocolate cake. You'd order to get one with the Gu or what order to get some sensation of connection with food. Did you think what's happening to me or did you think, oh, the moment my fingers were in this cake, I felt I'm in heaven. I've reconnected with the living. I have food if not in me, at least on me and at the moment where allowed, I'm experiencing most pleasure. My wife comes into the kitchen

Speaker 1:          10:16          when I went in to get the kids some more food. I found him. This of course is John's wife Susan with his hands in the cake just trying to touch the crumbs and he looked so guilty and I was also like, why are you doing? What are you doing? Like somebody's going through an underwear drawer. It was very, you know, wrong. And I have no explanation.

Speaker 4:          10:35          I mean I can say I need to do this. You have no idea how wonderful this is. Please give me some time alone with my bun cake.

Speaker 1:          10:46          It was this bizarrely funny, but deeply sad, perverse moments. Yeah. I suppose it was the first crack in my, in my bubbled, uh, attempt to pretend things were normal.

Speaker 6:          11:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          11:03          you know, I realized how bad things had gotten

Speaker 6:          11:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          11:10          and after that she says things only got worse. It just became, there was never anything to be happy about. He wasn't able to eat, he wasn't sure what the prognosis was. He wasn't sure if he was going to need a second surgery. It was just all bad. She says John became really depressed and he became very difficult to even, not even to cheer up, but just to say, well, let's just not talk about it for now. You know, he was constantly expressing his unhappiness was that, was that the thing? It was just the, it was dark all the time. Very dark.

Speaker 6:          11:45          Hmm.

Speaker 7:          11:46          It just became very hard to face. So she left.

Speaker 4:          11:53          Well, I had spring break and my kids had spring break. So Susan took the kids to her parents' place in Indiana for a week. I needed, I needed to take a break for good. Maybe the kind of break that means I'm not really sure what our future looks like. I don't know how we're going to do this and they can't really figure that out while I'm with you. So I was alone, not entirely while I was on the food pump and not doing well. But after a few days of moping around the house, John gets an idea. What I need to get myself out of this is I need to return to a place of sanctuary for me. There was a restaurant not far from your studio here called Chanterelle.

Speaker 3:          12:37          Uh,

Speaker 4:          12:37          it's a French restaurant and it was one of these very expensive capital letter restaurants that my wife and I had always planned to go to. If we had a special occasion for years. I walked past this restaurant and I would look in the window before getting onto the subway and I would see the plates of, you know, scallops coming out and the wine steward pouring, you know, red wine and the handwritten menus on the tables and things like that. So I thought if I can get to chanterelle and if I can look through the window, then I can heal myself.

Speaker 3:          13:11          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:11          I'll have a reason to hope. So I got on the subway and it was past four o'clock and I'm supposed to be home starting up the pump and feeding and I got off the subway and I walked over to Chanterelle on, I was kind of a little dizzy and delirious and I get to the window

Speaker 3:          13:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:31          and the dining room is empty.

Speaker 3:          13:34          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:34          there's dust on the floor, the wall panels have been stripped, the tables are bare, it's empty, it's a cave. Sometime in the intervening months or the proceeding months rather chanterelle has closed. And I didn't know that. Ah, you're killing me with this story. And I think to myself, you've reached the end of the line. This is it. There's nowhere else to go.

Speaker 3:          13:58          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          13:59          and um, I walk towards the river and I know that people throw themselves in when they do this. And it never made sense to me before, you know, I wasn't ever ready to end things. Well, you really, uh, cause I was having suicidal thoughts. I mean, I always having really depressed thoughts and I, I, and I don't know that I would have thrown myself in, but it was the first time I was standing at the edge thinking about it and thinking about this is how these things happen. So I got to the river and I blacked out.

Speaker 3:          14:31          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          14:31          collapsed on the sidewalk and I, I woke up and it was dark.

Speaker 3:          14:37          No,

Speaker 4:          14:37          I had scraped my Chin and my elbows were bruised and I'd taken a hard fall. And, um, I got up and I started to walk around. Uh, I was on this buckled old sidewalk and I looked around and there are these federal era houses and there was a grill, a gas grill in one of the backyards that was going, somebody was cooking dinner and I could smell it. I could smell the smoke coming off the grill and I could smell it. It was pork chops. And I was so delirious and so happy to be smelling food that I took it upon myself to finish cooking this guy's meal. So wait, what? So I, um, it's so eerie. I lifted up the lid, I lifted up the lid and it looked like to me, you know, one side of the pork shops were cooked and they were ready to be flipped.

Speaker 4:          15:31          So I flipped them. And, um, I was so far gone that I thought, okay, well four more minutes and these babies are going to be ready to go. And, and I didn't have a watch. So I started counting off, counting down for minutes in my head because I was going to get this stuff perfect. And all of a sudden the back door of this townhouse opens up and a guy walks out with an apron on and a cocktail in one hand and a season Shaker in the other. And he looks at me and I look very borderline. I mean, I'm rail fin. I've got, you know, I'm caught up from having fallen on the sidewalk. I've got, you know, crazy expression in my eyes. I haven't shaved in, you know, a week. I looked really very unsavory. So he sees me and I have no way of explaining myself other than to say they're just about done. And I hand him the tools and I turn around and I walk away before he has the chance to call the police or anything like that.

Speaker 4:          16:36          How many years ago was this? Uh, this was now, uh, three years ago. And what do you take away from that? Was that, uh, was that some kind of turning point where you walk away from the grill and you're ready to fight the good fight or what? Um, that only happens in the movies and in fairytales. But actually happened was I got sick again. Uh, I had another infection, more bacteria, and I had to go back to the hospital. And when I went back to the hospital this time they said, okay, we can't even do the food pump anymore because you keep getting these infections and if the bacteria spreads to your bloodstream through the food pump, but then you'll be gone and we can't operate on you because you won't survive the surgery. So all we have left is to try eating. The only thing that's left is to go back to food cause you can't ingest it intravenously.

Speaker 4:          17:27          We're afraid of infection and we can't repair your gut surgically. So the only way you can keep yourself alive is to try to use your gun again. Huh? So they start you on a, on around have a, I don't know, baby food gerbers I did start on the traditional applesauce and Jello and putting soft and easily digested foods. And John says they worked, his body was able to take the food but I couldn't taste anything. And it continued that way for another couple of months. And a deferred ever tastes like food again. Well I was at the radiologist, the scene, the scene I was expecting. Yeah. Well you know, I have a little ritual with this particular radiologist. He's on the east side and whenever I get tests there, when I'm done with the tests, I'm able to eat again. And again, this is when you do test prep, you're going about 24 hours without eating.

Speaker 4:          18:20          So you know, the thought of food becomes a celebration that you're going to have. Right? So there's a diner on third avenue and 84th street, a fifth street that I always go to and I get the same meal every time. I sit at the counter and I get fried egg and Bacon Sandwich on whole wheat toast. So I went there and I got the last seat at the counter and I ordered my usual and I chew into it and I realized that I've got sort of embryonic flavors going on. I've got the sort of the start of the sensation of tasting and the start of flavors in my mouth and I could feel that great combination of the fried egg congealing with the crunchy bacon and the crunchy toast. And I do the same, you know, mirror. I've got a knife about a knife and I do the same mirror knife examination at the counter and I can see that where before it was shiny and smooth as a porpoise. I've got little bristles, I've got little bumps on my tongue and I can taste this fantastic $3 sandwich. Do you kiss the lady sitting next to you? Well, I turned to the guy sitting next to me and I tell him, this is the best damn thing I've ever eaten. And in classic New York diner fashion.

Speaker 1:          19:39          Okay. Ready? Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and this whole hour we have been talking about good guts guts. In the last section we talked about bacteria and the armies of them that are in your gut. Yeah. The problem is that they're a little hard to picture kind of abstract. Oh, why don't we finish with a story that makes the whole issue real and much more concrete. This is the tail of a troubled relationship between a man and his on again, off again, gut. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Hello man. His name is John Reiner. He's a writer, lives here in New York. So one day you are eating your way through your life as you usually do, and then things take an odd turn. Yeah. How did it, how did it begin?

Speaker 4:          20:21          It began with the surprise. I'm his at home and I was about to go make myself a tuna. Yeah.
