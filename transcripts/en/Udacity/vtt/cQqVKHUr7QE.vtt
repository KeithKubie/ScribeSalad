00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.400
Let's go back to the question
about your paycheck.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.865
You make 7.95 an hour and
you work for 8.5 hours.

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:11.341
We multiply those two
together to get 67.575, but

00:00:11.341 --> 00:00:17.228
your employer is probably not going to
write you a check for $67.575.

00:00:17.228 --> 00:00:19.880
That doesn't make very much sense.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.849
So that means, we need to round
this to the hundredths place,

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:25.900
which means rounding
to two decimal places.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.380
Round 67.575 to two decimal places,
enter your answer in this box.
