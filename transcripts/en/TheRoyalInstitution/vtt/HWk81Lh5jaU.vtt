00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.270
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.250
Oh my word!

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.700
And suddenly the aircraft's
depressurising!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.976
You've got to get these oxygen
masks on as quick as you

00:00:16.976 --> 00:00:17.972
possibly can!

00:00:17.972 --> 00:00:19.222
One!

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:22.454
Perfect.

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:25.380
In you go, fast as you can!

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.410
My name's Hugh Montgomery.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.230
I'm Professor of Intensive
Care Medicine at UCL in

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.020
London, University College
London, where I direct the

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.380
Institute for Human Health
and Performance.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.460
My lectures were in 2007 on the
science of survival with

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
the running title of Back
From The Brink.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.860
When a meteorite struck the
Earth, it produced massive

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.770
climate change.

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.980
And that climate change was
not something that the

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.680
dinosaurs could adapt
to, and they died.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.800
But your ancestors survived.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.760
And in fact, they were lucky.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.320
But you're very lucky, too,
because there have been five

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.620
or six episodes of mass
extinction in the Earth's

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.770
history, all caused by climate
change, and every single time,

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.840
your ancestors have survived.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.540
In every case, we manage to hang
the lecture around a real

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.900
life survivor.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.530
So that for me was the most
exciting part of it.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.700
We had some tremendous
people in.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.840
Mike Stroud, who had man-hauled
across Antarctica.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.350
Ranulph Fiennes.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.330
And from that slot up there,
right in the ceiling,

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.220
abseiling in, Jamie Andrew,
who'd been stuck on a mountain

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.100
in the Alps for nearly seven
days, and ended up having both

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.956
arms and legs amputated.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:38.340
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.380
Well, there's an entrance,
Jamie.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.270
Thank you very much
for joining this.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.020
Now, this was an extraordinary
feat of survival.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.995
I think people looking at that
mountain, though, might not

00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:47.550
have quite a feel for
how cold it was.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:48.980
How cold were you
on that ridge?

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.200
It was very cold, indeed.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.810
I mean, the temperatures were
measured at minus 30 degrees

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.350
C.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.850
And strong winds as well?

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.810
130 kilometres an hour down
in the valley that day.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.910
I think the demonstrations are
crucial to the Christmas

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.160
Lectures, partly because
that's what they've

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.950
always had in them.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.320
It's like trying to
have Christmas

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.370
without turkeys and pudding.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.000
You just can't do it as
a Christmas Lecture.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.470
And CGI and so forth will never
replace that real sense

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.920
of awe children get when they
see something happening in

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.540
front of them which
can also go wrong.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.490
And they're working on
quite low pressure.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.270
And what I'd like you to do,
without stabbing and putting

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.360
your finger through, is
give that a push for

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.720
me when it's inflated.

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.280
What does it feel like?

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.120
Squidgy.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.650
Squidgy!

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.370
There we go.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:34.120
Isn't that beautiful?

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.840
And it's a lovely looking
heart, that.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.640
Put a twist in it.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.950
The molecule just
twists around.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.210
And as you can see, if I only
kept doing that, you get the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.930
famous double helix of DNA,
which you can see over here.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.550
In terms of things going wrong,
I suppose that's also

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.540
rather a tradition of the
Christmas Lectures, and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.920
actually makes it all
the more fun.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.450
Because they're not
edited out, these

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.410
things that go wrong.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.090
When things don't work, that's
part of the narrative.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.610
And we had model just over to my
right, actually, from where

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.780
I'm sitting now, of a cutout
man with a column that was

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.850
meant to give an index of how
much water he had in them.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.360
And we got a child pouring
in water to the level

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.340
that he'd been at.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.800
But of course, as often in the
Christmas Lectures, we were

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.580
down to the wire, Andy had been
working all night again

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.110
to try to get things together.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.650
Everyone rushed to
get out there.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.040
Off we go.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.300
The child is on the stairs.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.490
He's pouring the water in, and
it just poured straight out

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.145
the bottom, all over
the floor.

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:35.420
To here, now.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.580
Oh, it's leaking!

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.030
We'd better stop, hadn't we?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.882
He's having a pee!

00:03:38.882 --> 00:03:40.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.030
Your dad can't hold
his beer, can he?

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.430
Right!

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:44.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.074
Better get you out of the way.

00:03:47.074 --> 00:03:49.890
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.070
Presenting to children is every
bit as demanding as

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.840
presenting to adults,
if not more so.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.360
And I was trained by a professor
many years ago

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.680
called Eric Neal, who was
one of the world's great

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.910
physiologists.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.380
And I remember him saying to
me when I was merely a BSE

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.750
student, he said to me, Hugh,
if you can't explain your

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.360
science to a five-year-old, it
means you don't understand it.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.339
So genes are very important
because at the beginning of

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.600
each of them, there's a little
accelerator region.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.209
Just imagine it's a few
of these letters.

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.490
And if you switch on that
accelerator, you

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:24.775
switch on the gene.

00:04:24.775 --> 00:04:28.970
You switch on the gene, you
make more of the protein.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.910
So a gene determines which
protein you make, in what

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.710
cell, how much, and when.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.740
So I suppose all in all, the
Royal Institution Lectures are

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.890
hugely stressful.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.680
Very time consuming.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.670
But an enormous honour,
tremendously good fun, and the

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.560
reward of hearing 300 children
for five nights in a row

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.695
hanging on your every
word is fantastic.

00:04:50.695 --> 00:04:53.530
I strongly commend it for others
to do in the future.
