00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.080
Oscar Night!

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.940
It is Movie Town’s brightest hour!

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.460
A 12-month scramble for a small statue you can
hide in your overcoat pocket.

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.700
Raj: Have I ever yelled at the screen: “What
the hell were you thinking?”

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:14.900
[laughs]

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.120
Absolutely!

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.000
Patrick: The Academy of Motion Picture Arts
and Sciences is the preeminent organization

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.040
in the art of making motion pictures.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.580
It’s an organization that was founded in
1927.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.970
The first Oscars was, like, 15 people were
there.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.549
Louis B. Mayer wanted to have an organization
that could mediate labor disputes without

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:38.589
the unions.

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.010
Eventually, they wanted to honor achievement.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.640
Raj: The Oscar has two functions in a way.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.620
One function is to reward and celebrate great
artistic accomplishment, kind of our vicarious

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.500
way of saying: “We love you and we love what
you do for us and what you bring

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.600
into our lives!”

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.820
The other is to elevate and promote the industry
in general, and create awareness at least

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.340
once a year about an industry that depends
so much on the public’s engagement.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.680
MoMA was privileged in 1979 to receive an
actual Oscar.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.630
Gregory Peck: For contributing to the public’s
perception of motion pictures as an art form,

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.100
tonight the Academy once again pays tribute
to the Museum’s department of Film for its

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.880
continuing and growing accomplishments.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.840
Raj: So why am I putting gloves on to hold
a gold-plated statue?

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.700
It’s because it’s an object in MoMA’s
collection at this point, and we treat all

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.240
of our archival objects with great care.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.760
The winner was…

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.580
MoMA!

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.860
Oh my God!

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.980
It’s Oscar!

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.120
Hey man, what’s up?

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.840
Weight: 8 pounds, 8 ounces.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.440
Height: 13 and one half inches.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.840
Name...

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.760
Oscar!

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.520
Patrick: So the Oscar statuette was designed
by the MGM artist Cedric Gibbons.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.880
He’s a knight with a sword on a film reel
with the five spokes representing the original

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.400
branches of the Academy: actors, writers,
directors, producers and technicians.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.000
Our librarian, a woman named Margaret Herrick,
who eventually became our executive director,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.640
she looked at it and said it reminded her
of her uncle Oscar.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.100
There’s another story out there that Bette
Davis said it looked like one of her husbands.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.290
Bette Davis: The rear end of the Oscar looked
like him!

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.320
Patrick: Now we are 17 craft branches from
five.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:34.060
Oscar season maybe runs from October/November
through the actual ceremony.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:40.280
Raj: The chase for Awards is also a chase
for publicity and for awareness, and for “buzz”

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.900
and discussion.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.560
Patrick: You’re trying to position your
film so that the various critics and the various

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.240
Award shows can look at your film and think
of it as an Awards contender.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.080
There’s a fever pitch that happens, it’s
quite extraordinary.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.050
Raj: Probably everybody’s heard stories
about certain figures in the industry over

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.880
the years really targeting Academy groups
and lavishing them with parties and gifts.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.460
A lot of that has been reined in by the Academy,
realizing that if the process is corrupted,

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.989
then the legitimacy of the Awards will be
called into question.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.720
The Best Picture category’s probably the
most fraught.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.551
It’s certainly the one people remember the
most, and I’ll go out there and say,

00:03:23.551 --> 00:03:27.629
the year that Crash beat Brokeback Mountain,
which you know I’m not alone in thinking

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.780
was the biggest jaw-dropper of my lifetime,
you had to go back and question

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.960
"Well what happened there?”.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.820
There really was consensus that Brokeback
Mountain was the artistic achievement of the year,

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.660
certainly of that caliber or level of
filmmaking.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.340
One of the things I respect most about film
is that we in the film world are very honest

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.000
about our relationship with commerce.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.280
And that doesn’t happen in all the art forms.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.720
There’s a lot of art forms that really try
to hide the fact that there is commerce involved.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.600
So that relationship between art form and
industry is an integral part of the Academy.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.180
It’s not always money.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:08.120
Sometimes it’s relationships, sometimes
it’s who knows who within the Academy, who’s

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.640
shaking hands with whom at the right moment…

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:20.299
Patrick: I have much more faith in the Academy
voter, in that they will look at a film and

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.180
judge the film on its merit and not whether
or not they had a glass of wine and a piece

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.720
of cheese to go with that screening.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.960
Gregory Peck: Here’s how the voting for
the awards is done.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.260
Academy members voted by secret ballot for
five nominees in each category.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.120
Nominating is done by specialists in each
field.

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.320
For example, only cinematographers may nominate
cinematographers, writers writers and so on.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.360
Harry Belafonte: Finally Academy members voted
for all the awards of merit.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.920
The secret ballots were tabulated by the accounting
firm PriceWaterhouse.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.659
You got all that?

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.659
Okay.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.820
Patrick: Majority.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.340
Majority will lose.

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.760
Loretta Young: And as for you…

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.120
At long last!

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.700
Raj: People started really looking at the
make-up of the Academy, like who are these

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:10.980
members, and what’s the demographic?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.040
Because some of the choices they’re making
don’t seem to align at all with what’s

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.180
happening, certainly in the popular currents
or even in the direction of innovation, and

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.320
the Academy realized: “Ok, we really need
to take a hard look at this, our demographic

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.420
is too staid, it’s too homogeneous, so let’s
mix it up.”

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.139
I was honored to be invited to join the Academy
in 2017, as part of this new wave of getting

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.280
people involved from diverse corners of the
field and diverse backgrounds.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.940
More women coming in, more people of color
and more international folks.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:44.520
I think that’s been a critical element.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.949
If those audience members aren’t seeing
themselves reflected on-screen in the work

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:54.210
of not only the actors but the people behind
the cameras and seeing those people hold Oscars

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.899
at the end of the years for the films that
they love, you’re gonna start to lose audience

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:01.809
interest in both the Oscars and, you know,
potentially cinema itself.

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:07.499
When the hashtag #OscarsSoWhite movement came
together a few years ago, the one example

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:12.399
I remember most in a way was the film Creed,
which was directed by Ryan Coogler, starring

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:13.399
Michael B. Jordan.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:17.860
Sylvester Stallone was the only person nominated
for that film, and just really was kind of

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.860
like “Well wait a minute...”

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.740
Yeah Sly is critical to the Rocky history,
but this film wasn’t really Sly’s movie,

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:26.420
this was Ryan and Michael’s movie.

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:32.140
Taking a hard look at what happens when a
film like that can succeed and have the Academy’s

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.380
attention, and still not get nominations for
the kind of lead creators on that film,

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.640
really was kind of a shock to many of us.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.060
Ida Lupino: If a genie ever gave me a wish,
I think I’d know how I’d like to spend it.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.120
I want my name to be in a list like this.

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.240
Those nominated for the Best Achievement in
directing are…

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.220
Raj: It’s a big problem that there’s only
been one woman ever to win the Oscar

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.300
for Best Director.

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.600
And that’s Kathryn Bigelow for The Hurt
Locker.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.900
It went toe-to-toe with Avatar and

00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:05.509
ultimately walked away with both Best Director
and Best Picture, many many more people saw

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:06.870
this incredible work of art.

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:08.699
That was something great that Oscars could
do.

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:14.389
The fact that it hasn’t done that for more
women or more films directed by women, is

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:15.389
a huge problem.

00:07:15.389 --> 00:07:21.149
So a huge wave of the new members of the last
few years have been women, in all areas of

00:07:21.149 --> 00:07:22.460
creation on films.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.600
Will the Academy be able to celebrate the
contributions of women behind the camera in

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.580
ways that it hasn’t managed to in the past?

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.960
And if it can’t, I believe then that’s
when there’s a real problem with its viability

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.740
as recognizing what’s happening in the field.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.840
Kathryn Bigelow: There’s no other way to
describe it, it’s the moment of a lifetime.

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.000
Patrick: Once the show was televised, and
as we added more categories and opened it

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.619
up in honor of more crafts, there was a natural
progression for it to go from the small gala

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:54.240
to the big television production that it is
now.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:00.220
Raj: There have been hosts who have been fixtures,
so Bob Hope or Billy Crystal, Ellen DeGeneres,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.240
Whoopi Goldberg…

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:05.320
There have been duos, and then there have
been I think gaggles of hosts…

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:09.920
They’ve tried a lot, including no-host,
which may in fact be what the Academy tries

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:10.700
this year.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.900
Patrick: There are some favorite moments when
you’re watching this show.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.860
Raj: I think some of the best stories are
the ones of just the disasters at the Oscars.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.800
David Niven was presenting an Oscar when a
streaker ran behind him.

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.599
David Niven: Probably the only laugh that
man will ever get in his life is by stripping

00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.480
off and showing his shortcomings.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:36.020
Raj: I also was very privileged to bring my
mother to the Oscars when the wrong Best Picture

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:37.120
was awarded.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.430
We get to the end and all of a sudden they’re
taking an Oscar out of someone’s hand and

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:43.940
she was like: “Hey, has this happened before
what’s going on?”

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:45.710
And I was like: “I have no idea!”

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.700
Moonlight.

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:48.620
Best Picture.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.520
Patrick: The filmmakers who have won Oscars,
and I’ve talked to several, have said:

00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:54.500
“What does it mean now?”

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.120
And a lot of them say it’s a game changer
for them.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:02.580
It’s a game changer you know, doors open,
scripts come in, they can get appointments

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:07.850
and meetings with producers and other directors
and other actors, you know.

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:11.120
It really does open a door for them in their
career.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:15.650
Raj: Ultimately the goal is that the best
artistic work of the year is celebrated.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:21.900
It’s another opportunity for the industry
to acknowledge how important it is for cinema

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:27.700
to be recognized not just as a commercial
product, not just something that is escapist

00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:32.680
and pure entertainment, but that is actually
the collective efforts of an enormous

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:33.960
pool of talent.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:38.060
Patrick: What I hope the future of the Oscars
is, is that we continue to tune in and

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:44.300
we continue to make that one night the night
where everyone comes together, collectively

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:46.200
and enjoy the ceremony.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.760
Raj: He’s a reminder to all of us to always
celebrate great works of art, in any field,

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.170
but certainly in Film.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.500
We’ll see you soon Oscar, thanks for always
reminding us.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.440
Folks, we’ll see you at the movies.
