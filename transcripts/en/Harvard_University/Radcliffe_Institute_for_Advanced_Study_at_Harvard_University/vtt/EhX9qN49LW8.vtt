00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.520
- Thank you so much, Meredith,
for that introduction.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.670
I was telling her earlier
that, every time she

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.004
introduces one of us, we leave
feeling really motivated,

00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:14.420
and like, is she
talking about me?

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.200
Is this my work?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.390
Am I that amazing?

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.650
So I appreciate that.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.100
I also want to say thank you
to everyone at the Radcliffe

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.880
Institute.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.860
You all take such
good care of us

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.510
and make us feel so
special-- everyone

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.730
from Jess, who always
gives me a warm smile when

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.610
I walk in the building, to
the folks who have helped me

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.080
when I've locked myself
out of the office at night.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.340
So I'm thankful to you all.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.220
And also I want to say thank
you to my fellow Fellows,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.590
many of whom have heard me
speak about my research.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.300
And so it's a pleasure to
present it in more fullness

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.430
and richness, I hope, today.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:50.590
But also to friends
and colleagues

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.836
who are on various
fellowships across campus

00:00:52.836 --> 00:00:55.210
that I've been able to connect
with since I've been here.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.000
Thank you to you all, especially
my folks from the Hutchins

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.407
Center who came over to see me.

00:00:59.407 --> 00:01:00.490
I'm glad that you're here.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.490
So let me just say that this
is my first time presenting

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.850
any of this research, so
I want to allow myself

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.290
to be loose with it and have
some fun, because, as Meredith

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.520
said, I'm a serious scholar, but
I also like to bring some humor

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840
and hilarity to my work because
I think it keeps me grounded,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.500
and it keeps me human and
realizing that I'm not just

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.110
a thinker.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.860
I'm also a three
dimensional being.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.540
So I want to bring some of
that energy to the podium

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.310
tonight as I present on this
work, "The Glamorous Life--

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.800
Socialite Activists and
the Black Freedom Struggle

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.500
from World War II to
the Age of Obama."

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.380
First I'd like to say
I'm sorry to anyone

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.810
who wanted to hear me talk
about Barack Obama in depth.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.340
I won't be doing that tonight.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.010
I'm kind of starting from
the front end of the project.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.760
So most of it will be about
this immediate post-World War II

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.830
era, but I'm more than happy to
let you know what I'm thinking

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.880
about Barack Obama--

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.770
in particular, one of his early
members of his administration

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.440
who I might speak about
in a little bit of detail

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.035
if there's enough time
towards the end of my talk.

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:15.840
But I'm happy to talk about
Barack Obama during the Q&amp;A.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.910
So the first kernels
of this product

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.060
actually date back
to graduate school

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.910
when I was working on my
first book, Liberated Threads,

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.950
and I'll give you a
sense of how I arrived

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.490
at this topic a little bit
later on, but my interest in it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.270
never died.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.477
When you're a graduate
researcher and you say,

00:02:32.477 --> 00:02:34.560
oh, this is going to be
my second book because you

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.720
find a few interesting
documents in the archive,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.210
but does it really
become the second book?

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.340
So I guess technically this
will be my second book,

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.190
but it is one of my--

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.930
the project that I
imagined then-- it still

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.890
is very similar to what
I imagined then in terms

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.620
of its shape and scope.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.370
And I used the Schomburg
Center Fellowship

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.950
to collect much of
the archival material

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.960
that I'll present
on today, but it

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.390
wasn't until this last
semester at the Radcliffe

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.010
that I was able
to actually start

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.891
analyzing some of that data.

00:03:06.891 --> 00:03:08.640
So what I'm going to
be presenting tonight

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.740
are some of my first
impressions about a lot

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.870
of the research I
found in the archive

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.180
while I was at the
Schomburg Center.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.525
Tea and shade, an introduction.

00:03:17.525 --> 00:03:18.900
And for me it's
a way of thinking

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.060
about the embodiment of
the women in this era

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.480
that they were living through--

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.270
tea and shade.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.436
How many people are familiar
with this language, tea

00:03:28.436 --> 00:03:29.320
and shade?

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.820
I know.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.210
You're probably like,
oh, I knew that.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:32.100
As soon as I said
it, you're like,

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.250
I already know what
tea and shade means.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.710
She don't have to tell me.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.710
But I'm going to tell you
a little bit about how

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.670
tea and shade informs
how I'm thinking

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.610
about these socialite
activist women.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.120
So in spring 1954, the
New York Amsterdam News

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.110
published a series of stories
on black society women.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.680
Betty Granger, the series
author and Amsterdam News

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.620
social editor, argued
that society life

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.440
had changed quite
drastically since the days

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.130
when A'Lelia Walker reigned as
the queen of black social life

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.750
in New York City.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.570
The millionaire heiress
to the Madam C.J. Walker

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.420
beauty empire hosted
lavish events,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.970
both at her Manhattan
apartment and also

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.540
at her Westchester county
estate villa, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.470
By the time of Granger's
series, the original black 400

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.430
had all but died off, and many
of their customs, rituals,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.160
and standards had
perished with them.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.370
Who was the current grand
dame of black society?

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.230
Granger wanted to know.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:36.490
What were the new requirements
for becoming a social leader?

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.560
Granger wrote, "we
want our readers

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.610
to decide in true democratic
fashion exactly who rules

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.300
supreme as New York's
modern day social queen."

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.890
For three weeks,
the Amsterdam News

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.470
accepted letters and
postcards from readers

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.900
who casted their votes.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.880
And the letters poured
in even from people

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.780
who didn't live in New York, but
who wanted to offer commentary

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.180
on the so-called black elite.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.550
Commenting on the
old guard rules

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.190
for becoming part of
the negro aristocracy,

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.830
Granger reminded
readers that it's long

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.880
been said that to join the
ranks of black society you must,

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.380
quote, "take a woman with some
family background [? add in ?]

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:21.310
a basic education, toss
in some accessible cash,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.550
and mix plentifully with
membership in one or two

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.330
nationally established
clubs or sororities.

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:30.310
And there you have the
fundamental requirements

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.310
for our social
potpourri," unquote.

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.020
Yet she notes that
there were regional,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.240
or even state to
state differences.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.710
She claimed that
in the Midwest--

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.870
notably Chicago and Detroit--

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.250
it's money and more money
that makes an ambitious gal

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.800
eligible for high society.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.570
In Atlanta, she
says it's education.

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.970
A PhD is your best bet
for social success.

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:59.540
In Charleston, South Carolina,
your rank in the social order

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.950
is gauged by quote, "the
paleness of your skin."

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.670
And in Boston, she says it's
family background and nothing

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.420
else that lets you in.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.030
So she notes here that,
whereas people had just

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.520
accepted these rules
pretty much as gospel,

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.850
that in the post World War
II era, that people were

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.772
challenging these ideas, and
that there was opportunity

00:06:25.772 --> 00:06:27.730
for people who never
would have been considered

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.410
part of black society to
now enter that said society.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.790
So people were
critiquing colorism,

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:39.250
possessing distinguished
family name, and requirement

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.169
of generational wealth.

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.960
Well, essentially the
whole entire system--

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.940
everything she said that people
wanted you to have to be a part

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.780
of society--

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:48.640
she says now it's
pretty much a no go.

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.100
People are trying to
throw out these old rules.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.560
So at the end of the
three week voting period,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:57.910
Granger noted that they
received hundreds of letters

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.560
from readers near and far.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.420
And the Amsterdam
News, of course,

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.240
published the most
provocative missives.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.380
And again, let me say people
had many feelings on the topic.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.280
And they was all up
in their feelings.

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.480
So for example, Ms. Avis
[? Malcoa, ?] an employee

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.320
of the Edison Hotel, goes in,
calling out what she considers

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.370
the types of socialites--
the nasty snobs with too much

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.610
useless education, the
dumb yellow chicks--

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.500
these are her words, not mine--

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.890
who use their good looks to make
up for their lack of pedigree,

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.220
and the big shot women who
lucked into wealth by hitting

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.160
the lottery, but have
none of the social graces.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.510
For example, she says, they buy
Cadillacs with their winnings,

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.620
throw wild parties, drink all
the brown liquor, and, quote,

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.840
"wind up talking
loud and wrong."

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:52.240
[? Malcoa ?] pivots to
acknowledge the women

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.390
she feels are outstanding
members of our race,

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.600
women who have given
unselfishly to uplift the race--

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.260
the entire race, not
just a particular class.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.129
She names Mary
McLeod Bethune, who

00:08:04.129 --> 00:08:05.920
you're going to hear
about in a little bit,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.130
and Marian Anderson as examples.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.916
Eva Tucker, a member of the
Metropolitan Mothers Club--

00:08:12.916 --> 00:08:15.040
so she would have been one
of these society women--

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.310
wrote in saying that the
modern social leader must

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:22.540
be an intelligent career woman,
who must have distinguished

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.440
themselves in this community
in terms of civic leadership.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.280
She must entertain in good
taste and smart style,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.140
because according
to Tucker, quote,

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:35.380
"Madam Walker's style
of big time entertaining

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.240
is no longer fashionable.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.880
People woke up to the
fact a long time ago

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.539
that spending hundreds and
maybe even thousands of dollars

00:08:43.539 --> 00:08:46.210
on food and drink
for would be friends

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.830
wasn't the smartest thing in
the world to do," end quote.

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.000
On the top of Eve Tucker's
list, a society leader

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.980
who met all of her
requirements was

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:58.990
a woman who most
people in this room

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:00.970
have never heard of before--

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:03.560
Mollie Moon.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:07.070
My talk will center on Moon,
the undisputed social queen

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:10.040
of Harlem in the
mid 20th century.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:13.340
In her obituary in
1990, Jet magazine,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.550
one of the black
bibles, wrote that Moon

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:21.020
had raised $3.4 million for
the National Urban League,

00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:24.500
and she'd also helped fundraiser
for other smaller Harlem based

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.960
organizations and institutions.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.320
Moon is most known for
founding the Urban League Guild

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.490
and serving as president
of the Guild for 50 years.

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:38.690
That's a long time.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.322
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:40.322 --> 00:09:42.530
That should tell you something
about her personality.

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.030
I'm just saying.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.670
The Urban League Guild was the
social wing of the National

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.670
Urban League that helped
translate the organization's

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:53.870
mission to everyday people
and wealthy would be donors.

00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.320
In short, they made the
organization look cool and have

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.760
broader appeal.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.130
In hip hop parlance, the Guild
was the hype man to the emcee.

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:08.180
I first learned of Mollie
as a graduate student

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.800
trying to learn
all I could about

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.310
black nationalist protests
against a white owned wig shop.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.690
And the more I learned about her
and the Beaux-Arts costume ball

00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.300
and beauty pageant the
Guild hosted each year,

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:22.970
the more I became
intrigued not only

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.610
by how she raised
all of that money

00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:29.180
and for which specific
causes, but by the culture

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:32.930
of fundraising and the
lifestyle of a fundraiser,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:35.480
a social and
political powerbroker

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.030
and the powerbroker's
role within this larger

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:41.180
constellation of activists
and intellectuals

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:44.990
who feature prominently in
civil rights movement history.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.330
And I've been followed
following the money trail,

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:51.670
and it's led me to some
interesting places--

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.370
some scandalous places, even.

00:10:54.370 --> 00:10:56.960
I've also discovered the names
of other women like Mollie

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.590
who have used their social cache
and extensive networks to host

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.970
both public and private events
for a range of organizations

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:07.320
devoted to racial equality.

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.170
So the scholarship
has taught us--

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:11.710
and it's a rather
robust scholarship

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:15.090
that says that black women were
the backbone of the movement.

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:16.656
No matter what period
of time we look

00:11:16.656 --> 00:11:19.280
at, this is true, whether we are
talking about the civil rights

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.170
movement, the feminist
movement, the Black

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:25.700
Lives Matter movement of today.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:26.840
Women are the backbone.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.850
However, the nature
and international scope

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:33.600
of their fundraising
has gone understudied.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.720
So what I've been
trying to do then

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.340
is piece together this history
and understand why these women

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:43.890
are not in the historiography.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:49.590
So I think part of the problem
is a question about paradigms.

00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:51.450
So in my first book,
Liberated Threads,

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.850
I tried to introduce
a new way or paradigm

00:11:53.850 --> 00:11:55.890
for studying the
civil rights movement,

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:59.970
because what I'd realized was
that black women's activism had

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:03.780
been kind of categorized
into these types--

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.600
so the respectable church lady
and the radical freedom fighter

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.120
being two of them that have
emerged from this time period

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.640
as lenses for seeing
and understanding

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.730
black women's cultural
and political activism--

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:17.910
and also because questions
of periodization and subfield

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:20.430
specific questions
have meant that Mollie

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.550
Moon and her generation
have not been highly visible

00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:26.610
because they haven't fit neatly
within the black women's club

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:28.890
movement literature,
which typically ends

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.250
at the start of World War II.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.230
And temporally,
Mollie's generation

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.440
considered themselves
patrons of the arts.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.240
That was one of their
major commitments

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.950
in terms of their
activism, and they'd

00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:43.620
fall into this lacuna between
the scholarship of the Harlem

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.230
Renaissance in the '20s
and '30s and the black arts

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.120
movement in the '60s and '70s.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.130
So for me, I'm
interested in what

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:52.710
they were doing in
the '40s and '50s

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:56.850
as it relates to black
arts and the protection

00:12:56.850 --> 00:13:00.750
and proliferation of black
arts in that time period.

00:13:00.750 --> 00:13:03.030
Also, I find that we don't
see them in the old left

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:06.810
to new left conversation,
which typically doesn't focus

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.660
on black women much
at all, but they also

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.570
haven't been taken up in
this black internationalism

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.030
scholarship either.

00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.160
And they also aren't part of
this black intellectual history

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:21.600
turn, because they sit at
this interesting and quite

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.950
challenging to recover
intersection of civil rights

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:29.880
history, business history,
beauty and grooming culture,

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.800
fashion, consumer and economics,
and also material culture.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.530
So there's this small yet
burgeoning body of scholarship

00:13:37.530 --> 00:13:39.790
that does this type
of recovery work.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:44.075
So I would say my first two
books, I think, do this work

00:13:44.075 --> 00:13:47.730
and try to establish a way for
doing this work through what I

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:51.120
call eclectic archiving, which,
as Meredith mentioned earlier,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.910
requires me to draw from a lot
of different types of source

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.330
material and also take an
interdisciplinary approach

00:13:57.330 --> 00:13:59.790
to the study of history.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.700
But then there is
also Robert Weems,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.590
Desegregating the Black Dollar.

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.710
Susannah Walker,
Style and Status.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:14.310
My colleague Tiffany
Gill's Beauty Shop Politics

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:16.387
and her new book on
black women and travel.

00:14:16.387 --> 00:14:18.220
And as we talk more and
more about our work,

00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:20.270
we realize we have so
many women in common

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:22.080
they overlap in our work.

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.050
And then also Quincy Mills,
Cutting Along the Color Line,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:30.020
and his new project,
The Wages of Resistance,

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.020
which also looks at how the
civil rights and black power

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.160
organizations negotiated their
need for funds and fundraising

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:41.510
with their anti capitalist and
anti imperialist ideologies.

00:14:41.510 --> 00:14:45.320
In my own work, I'm toying with
this concept of black glamor

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.450
as a guiding
framework to uncover

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.780
the modes of embodied activism
that Mollie and her peers

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.340
employed.

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:56.300
It began with my fascination
with our collective fascination

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:58.430
with the black glamor set.

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.440
Entire Tumblrs and
Instagrams have

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.370
been devoted to celebrating
black history of glamor

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.580
as a way to celebrate
our humanity, our style,

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:10.910
our pleasure and joy,
the beauty of our people,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.090
to challenge the notion that
high femininity and refinement

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.890
was solely for white women--

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:18.990
that black women have
been about that life,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.890
which is really true.

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.150
Look at any time period.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.730
Black women have been glamorous.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:24.960
Thus glamor becomes
an interesting way

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:28.290
to examine insider-outsider
cultures and class

00:15:28.290 --> 00:15:32.370
categories that become much
more malleable when we think

00:15:32.370 --> 00:15:34.800
of glamor as a
performance, one that

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.160
is often more about
aspiration than what

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.110
one has in the bank account.

00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:43.170
So by winning the battle
on the taste lines, if not

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:45.300
the front lines,
of the movement,

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.310
Moon and those who
followed in her footsteps

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.490
influenced modern rules of
etiquette, style, and party

00:15:50.490 --> 00:15:53.610
planning that continue to be
promulgated by Ladies Home

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:56.040
Journal and W magazine.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.710
So these women, with their
impeccable sense of style,

00:15:58.710 --> 00:16:01.770
and good looks, and
cosmopolitan charm,

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.290
had the cultural capital
necessary to host

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:06.660
these star studded
fundraising events

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:10.470
and exclusive parties that
brought politicians, activists,

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:13.650
and prominent philanthropists,
such as the Rockefellers,

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.510
the Vanderbilts,
and the Fields--

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.180
of the Marshall Field's
department store empire--

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:20.510
and so forth into
conversation with one another

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:22.170
and with a wider movement.

00:16:22.170 --> 00:16:25.740
So I delve into this opulent
world of the black middle class

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.720
or this black elite
to examine how

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.210
conspicuous
consumption, pleasure,

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.580
and leisure culture
both coalesce with

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.060
and undermine the aims of
the Black Freedom Project.

00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:38.580
Specifically, I,
like Quincy Mills,

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:41.610
am thinking critically
about how Moon and her ilk

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:44.670
are touting relationships
with families whose names are

00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:48.810
synonymous with American
capitalism and heads of state

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:50.010
in the British empire--

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:51.930
of the British empire
in the Caribbean,

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:53.790
while activists
like Claudia Jones

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.910
are using every platform
possible to dismantle

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.690
imperialism.

00:16:59.690 --> 00:17:01.940
But somebody has got
to raise the money.

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:05.569
So if we look at all
of these organizations,

00:17:05.569 --> 00:17:09.500
we see some ties
that raise eyebrows.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.589
Enter the tea and the shade.

00:17:12.589 --> 00:17:15.950
So these women were hyper
visible in the archive,

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.430
and in my own archive I now
have over 2,000 clippings

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:22.250
from black newspapers
on Moon and Eunice

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:24.349
Johnson, who features
prominently in the work,

00:17:24.349 --> 00:17:27.230
and also Desiree Rogers, who
was the first social secretary

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:29.240
of the Obama administration.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.660
And when I'm reading
these newspaper clippings

00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:35.360
and putting them in
conversation with all sorts

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.750
of other material, including
literature and menus

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:41.990
from the venues they
hosted their events,

00:17:41.990 --> 00:17:46.950
from personal correspondence, I
see that the tea was spilling,

00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:52.760
and the shade was intense,
especially from the Baltimore

00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.140
Afro-American.

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.430
That was a shady newspaper.

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.530
I love them.

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:00.874
I love reading their account
of this black high society

00:18:00.874 --> 00:18:03.290
and the fact that they feel
like, from their vantage point

00:18:03.290 --> 00:18:05.900
in Baltimore, they
have the ability

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:09.620
to speak on what's happening
in New York, the big town

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:13.850
black society, in ways that the
New York Amsterdam News can't

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:18.140
because they are essentially a
vehicle of the National Urban

00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.680
League.

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.580
So I want to just talk a little
bit about Mollie, a woman

00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:27.510
that I have really
come to admire a lot.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:28.080
I love her.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.240
I love writing about
complicated black women,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.220
and she is complicated,
and complex,

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:35.460
and messy in all the ways that
makes my job as a historian

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:37.170
and a storyteller fun.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.060
So I love her.

00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:44.160
So to put it bluntly,
Mollie was a hustler.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:48.990
Mollie came from a family
of no importance that

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.320
wasn't at all wealthy, and that
had migrated from the south

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.160
to the Midwest.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.010
And in the Midwest, I'm
talking about Gary, Indiana.

00:18:57.010 --> 00:19:00.570
And I can say it like that
because I'm from Indiana.

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:03.570
So by the time I encounter
Mollie in the archive,

00:19:03.570 --> 00:19:06.990
she is moving back and forth
between New York and Gary.

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:09.959
She was born allegedly in 1912.

00:19:09.959 --> 00:19:10.500
I don't know.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.210
I just like these women--
are you really telling

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:13.050
the truth about your age?

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:13.650
I don't really know.

00:19:13.650 --> 00:19:15.024
So many of her
background details

00:19:15.024 --> 00:19:17.610
are sketchy because
she, like a lot of women

00:19:17.610 --> 00:19:21.830
in this interwar period who
were moving across the US,

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:23.640
were using this
as an opportunity

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.380
to remake themselves.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:27.600
So Mollie attended
Meharry Medical College,

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:29.970
and she earned a
degree in pharmacy.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.570
She takes a few classes at
Columbia's teacher college,

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:39.440
and she eventually becomes a
social worker of all things.

00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.240
And she meets
Henry Lee Moon, who

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.460
will become her husband,
on a trip to Russia

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.600
in the early 1930s.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.700
So she did her bit
to study abroad,

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:50.210
and she was learning
German, too.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.740
And Henry is also
from the midwest,

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.850
and he's from Cleveland, but
from a more prominent family.

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:59.060
His father actually founded
the chapter of the NAACP

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.050
in Cleveland.

00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.530
Henry has a degree from Howard.

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.530
He pledged Omega Psi Phi, so he
has the fraternity credentials

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:05.030
there.

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.070
He earned a master's
degree, and he's

00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:10.940
a journalist writing for the
Amsterdam News when they meet.

00:20:10.940 --> 00:20:13.640
He goes on to become
a public relations

00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:17.345
director for the NAACP and
also a writer for the crisis.

00:20:20.170 --> 00:20:23.230
While Mollie's moving back and
forth between her mother's home

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:28.690
in Gary and New York City, where
she's meeting all these folks,

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.900
she finds that she has
a knack for meeting

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:33.730
wealthy, wealthy people--

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:34.894
prominent writers.

00:20:34.894 --> 00:20:37.060
For example, I was digging
around in the Schlesinger

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.920
archive, and I found
this letter from Mollie

00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.870
to writer Dorothy West.

00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:45.154
And in it, Dorothy--

00:20:45.154 --> 00:20:46.570
for people who
don't know, Dorothy

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:49.030
is the daughter of one of
the wealthiest black families

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:51.070
in Boston.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:55.300
And Mollie is saying
to her, I'm flat broke.

00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:56.730
We should move in together.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:57.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:01.330
You can help me pay my bills,
and we can split our rent.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:04.480
I think she says here it
would be $14 for each of us

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.920
if we move in together.

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.230
So she has this knack
for meeting people,

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:09.880
for making friends.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.550
She's good at corresponding and
keeping in touch with people.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:19.720
And so by the time she marries
Henry Lee Moon in 1938,

00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.410
she is known for being
this active woman

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:26.590
on the social scene
in New York City.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.110
And let me just say
this as an aside.

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:33.550
It just made me love
her more, but when

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:34.872
they start corresponding--

00:21:34.872 --> 00:21:36.330
I've been all up
in their letters--

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.230
they write the way we text.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:39.910
I mean, there's just
so many letters,

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:43.840
and he was pretty much
engaged to this other woman.

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.350
And so Mollie's writing him,
oh, hey, hey, all this stuff.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:49.000
They're friends.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.550
And then before you know
it, she has him paying

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.090
her mother's medical bills.

00:21:53.090 --> 00:21:55.205
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:55.205 --> 00:21:56.860
I was like, yes, Mollie.

00:21:56.860 --> 00:22:00.130
So anyway, she ends up
moving to New York City,

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.450
and they get married.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.160
They get a place
together, and they

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:09.060
become known as the socialite
and the intellectual.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.500
They both see themselves
as race people.

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.790
She's a race woman.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.650
So she's not just
a party planner.

00:22:14.650 --> 00:22:16.930
She is also a woman
who cares very

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.820
much about the equality
of black people

00:22:20.820 --> 00:22:23.050
and ending racial disparities.

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:25.270
And so she first
tries to mold herself

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:30.610
after some of these women of the
black 400, as they were known,

00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:32.860
these women who--

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.410
are you familiar with
this language of the 400?

00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:38.860
In the late 19th
century it was this idea

00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:40.900
that, oh, we're going
to throw this party,

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:42.080
and we're going to invite--

00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.750
it can fit 400
people, so we're only

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.440
going to invite the most
important 400 society people.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.930
So then, of course, black
people had their version

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:51.520
of this, the black 400.

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.620
So Mollie is trying
to model herself

00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:56.980
after Bessye Bearden, who
is Romare Bearden's mom

00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:03.160
and very active on the social
and art scenes in Harlem.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.240
But by the time she
establishes the Guild in 1942,

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.290
she realizes that
this is her place,

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.530
that this is the way that
she can make her mark.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:14.200
And so in 1947, the
Los Angeles Sentinel

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.870
writes "undisputed
Harlem hostess

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:22.120
beyond comparison this season is
individual dynamic Mollie Moon.

00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:28.010
Her parties gather the most
fascinating people in town.

00:23:28.010 --> 00:23:29.470
They're like the
Negro Renaissance

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:31.480
era in flavor and texture.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.390
Nobody in town can come near
her for sheer excellence

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.340
in unusual party giving.

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.830
She reigns supreme
and legendary."

00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:45.450
So these are some images
from an Urban League luncheon

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:46.770
that Mollie is hosting.

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:54.350
Mollie is standing with
the white blazer on.

00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.770
So then a pivotal moment
happens in her career

00:23:57.770 --> 00:24:00.770
as this socialite who's trying
to really emerge as a race

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:02.570
woman, as well.

00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:07.160
In May, 1951, Mollie
called the Hotel Pierre

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:11.690
to book the rooftop garden and
secure catering for a party

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:15.510
to be held on the
evening of July 20.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:18.020
Now, the key to being
a successful socialite

00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.030
and hostess is--

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:23.540
as you can imagine, I'm sure--
location, location, location.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:27.060
You have to have the dopest
spots to have your events--

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:27.560
period.

00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:29.270
People want to go
somewhere that they

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:33.210
can feel like, oh, yes,
this is the place to be.

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.290
So she's hosting the Urban
League's wealthiest donors

00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.670
at this event,
and so she decides

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:43.550
that the Pierre, with its
Upper East Side address--

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:46.710
it sits at 2 East 61st
and Fifth Avenue--

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:49.580
have that air of
refinement and exclusivity

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:52.010
that Mollie needed
for the event.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.070
Plus it was a visually
stunning hotel from its decor

00:24:55.070 --> 00:24:58.130
to its unobstructed
views of Central Park.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:25:02.570
And so she calls over
the phone to book

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:10.100
the garden on the roof for
her event, and she's told,

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.660
sure, yes, you can
book the event there.

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:15.120
We can get the catering
set up, et cetera.

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.550
So then Mollie strolls into
the Pierre to pay her deposit.

00:25:19.550 --> 00:25:21.300
This is how I imagine
she walked in there.

00:25:21.300 --> 00:25:21.799
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:22.470
I don't know.

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:25.150
And then I imagine her sounding
like Eartha Kitt and saying,

00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:28.350
yes, darling, I'm here
to pay my deposit.

00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:33.120
So she goes to pay this
deposit, and the assistant

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.440
to the catering manager
is like, oh, no.

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.940
That room is closed.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:39.990
It's booked that day.

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:41.310
It's booked that day.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.600
I think they told her
it was booked that day,

00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.860
and they told her it was closed.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:44.651
They told her both.

00:25:44.651 --> 00:25:47.070
It's closed for repairs,
and it's already booked.

00:25:47.070 --> 00:25:49.770
And so she was saying, well,
hey, I was told over the phone

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:51.600
that I can make this booking.

00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.640
And he's like, no, you can't.

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.760
The man she spoke to on
the phone, a guy named

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.420
WM [? Willey, ?] refused
to speak to her in person.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.600
And a couple of days later,
Mollie had one of her friends

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.330
go in there then
since they refused

00:26:06.330 --> 00:26:07.840
to give her the booking--

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.880
the wife of a prominent
Wall Street attorney

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.160
named Elizabeth
[? Fillman ?] and she

00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:17.200
had her attempt to book the
rooftop for that same day.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.060
So [? Willey, ?]
the banquet manager,

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.180
asked [? Fillman ?] if any
colored persons would be

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.140
attending the event
she was planning.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.370
He reminded her that the
Pierre was a high class hotel.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.370
Once she assured him that
no Negroes would be present,

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.170
he accepted her booking.

00:26:32.170 --> 00:26:36.520
Well, that was all the
proof Mollie needed.

00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.580
She filed a lawsuit against
Getty Realty Corporation,

00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.430
the company that owned the
hotel, the banquet manager,

00:26:42.430 --> 00:26:46.750
and his assistant under the
sections 40 and 41 of the New

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.940
York State Civil
Rights Law concerning

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:51.310
public accommodations.

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.740
And then [? Fillman ?] and
another person whom Molly

00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:56.680
had booked the
rooftop for that day--

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.390
for the day before,
actually, since she

00:26:58.390 --> 00:27:00.230
was told that it was--
one of the excuses

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:02.200
they gave her that it
was closed for repairs.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:06.280
She had both of them
testify for her in court.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:11.080
And the judge
presiding over the case

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.190
was a man named Abraham
Goodman, who presided over

00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:18.220
one of the first cases
tried in New York following

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.860
the enactment of the
civil rights law.

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:25.360
So Mollie won her case and
received a $600 settlement.

00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:29.840
So the max she could receive
was $500 per defendant,

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.810
and so she wins this $600, and
people see this as a victory.

00:27:34.810 --> 00:27:41.940
And the Baltimore Afro-American
writes the Urban League Guild

00:27:41.940 --> 00:27:45.090
was, quote, "more militant
than the parent group

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:46.810
which organized it."

00:27:46.810 --> 00:27:47.670
Shade, right?

00:27:47.670 --> 00:27:48.660
I just love it.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:51.900
So they're saying basically
that Mollie was bold enough

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.150
to do something that
even the Urban League

00:27:54.150 --> 00:27:56.070
Guild doesn't use as a tactic.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.770
She was using the court
systems in her favor,

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.810
and once she did this, her
popularity really skyrocketed.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:07.100
Just as a note of aside
here in terms of methods,

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.987
once I found this lawsuit,
I started to, A, look

00:28:09.987 --> 00:28:11.820
to see if there were
other similar lawsuits.

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.120
Are these socialite women who
want to host garden rooftop

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.510
parties saying, well, listen,
if you won't give us bookings,

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:19.360
we will sue you.

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.050
Some I'm looking for
that, but I'm also

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.900
keeping a list of hotels
that are mentioned

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.090
in the black press as
places that allowed

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:29.250
them to host these events.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.590
And so here's a
list of the names

00:28:31.590 --> 00:28:32.950
that I've come across so far.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:34.680
Now, I will admit
most of my research

00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.560
has been going through documents
based on Mollie in New York

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:39.510
City, so I imagine
that, as I dig

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:41.850
into the research
in DC and Chicago,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:46.190
more hotels will be
added to this list.

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:49.430
So like I said,
after this event--

00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:52.490
after the lawsuit,
Mollie's popularity soars.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:56.360
And she's honored as woman
of the year for her 14

00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.360
years of [? inspiring ?]
and distinguished leadership

00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:02.180
with the Urban League
Guild, the Harlem Hospital

00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:06.980
Auxiliary, and the
Spence-Chapin adoption service.

00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:08.891
And it's noted in
the publication--

00:29:08.891 --> 00:29:09.890
this is not about that--

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:12.348
I just like this because she's
wearing a fur and a big hat,

00:29:12.348 --> 00:29:14.170
and I love a big hat.

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:17.300
But this image-- it just kind
of speaks to the identity

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.400
that she's trying to
create at the time.

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.590
But when she
receives this award,

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.695
Ralph J. Bunche presents
her with the award,

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:26.270
and so the black press
is like, Mollie's famous.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.490
Ralph Bunche is presenting
her with an award.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.510
And then the legendary
journalist and society woman

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:34.700
Gerri Major, who was
part of the black 400,

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.740
toasted Mollie, as well
as her very good friend,

00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:42.440
Jeanne Murray Vanderbilt, the
wife of Alfred Vanderbilt II.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.260
So she has these famous
and important friends

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.630
who see her as an
important woman,

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:52.250
and also in 1959 she was honored
alongside Lorraine Hansberry

00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:55.400
for her commitment
to civic welfare.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.790
So they're feting
Lorraine Hansberry,

00:29:58.790 --> 00:30:01.070
and Mollie is right there
with Lorraine Hansberry.

00:30:01.070 --> 00:30:03.140
I'm saying this just
to give you a sense

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:09.250
of the scope of her
popularity and the reach,

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.370
but she was also this
very polarizing figure.

00:30:12.370 --> 00:30:14.350
So on the one hand,
she has the engine

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:16.180
of the black press
who's promoting

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.050
everything she's doing.

00:30:18.050 --> 00:30:20.670
On the other hand-- except for
the Baltimore Afro-American.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:22.620
They're not having anything--

00:30:22.620 --> 00:30:25.690
they will critique her when
they feel like it's necessary,

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.660
but she's also the subject of
much scrutiny and criticism.

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.800
She's accused of
misappropriating funds,

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.790
and that was actually a very
interesting article to read,

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:38.740
where basically the
New York Amsterdam

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.470
News reports that the Urban
League is like, OK, hands off.

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.140
We're going to let
them figure it out

00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:45.850
because a white
woman was claiming

00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.672
that Mollie misappropriated
funds for events.

00:30:48.672 --> 00:30:50.380
So they kind of took
a hands off approach

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:52.420
and let Molly handle it.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.570
There was also lots of gossip
about her alleged affairs,

00:30:55.570 --> 00:30:59.620
and in the mid 1960s, she sued
a very prominent and wealthy

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.200
white socialite for $1
million for defamation.

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.930
There was scrutiny about
her interracial approach

00:31:06.930 --> 00:31:09.930
to race relations, and one of
the most fascinating things

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:13.770
I found on this was a
book by Chester Himes,

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:16.110
a social and political
satire called Pinktoes.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:18.180
It was published in 1961--

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.180
where Moon is the inspiration
for the maligned protagonist

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:22.650
Mamie Mason.

00:31:22.650 --> 00:31:26.610
And so Himes is
critical of Mamie Mason

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.010
and these interracial
parties that she

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:33.450
throws, which he considers
orgies for the racial uplift

00:31:33.450 --> 00:31:34.530
cause.

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:36.210
And what's interesting
is that Himes

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:39.780
is first cousins to
Mollie's husband, Henry,

00:31:39.780 --> 00:31:43.140
and so he was actually
living with Mollie and Henry

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:46.740
at the time that he's doing
all this research for the book.

00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.280
And then he writes this scathing
piece on interracial race

00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.920
relations and their
parties for the book.

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:54.870
Got to love family.

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:56.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:57.690
It's an interesting book.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:31:59.556
You should check it out.

00:31:59.556 --> 00:32:00.930
So in my last few
minutes, I want

00:32:00.930 --> 00:32:06.780
to say a little bit specifically
about fundraising here.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.960
So as I mentioned earlier, one
of Mollie's most popular events

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:14.490
was the Beaux-Arts Ball, which
she started hosting in 1942.

00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:16.920
And these balls were
the major fundraisers

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.870
for the Urban League Guild.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.220
As you can see here--

00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.580
well, first let me point
out this is Mollie here.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.300
Isn't that a hat?

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:25.500
That's a hat, isn't it?

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.251
So this is the Beaux-Arts
queen for that year.

00:32:28.251 --> 00:32:29.250
Do you know who this is?

00:32:29.250 --> 00:32:29.961
- [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:29.961 --> 00:32:30.460
- Right.

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.460
So we got Josephine Baker here.

00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.680
I mean, when Mollie can
make Josephine Baker look

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.630
like just a regular person
when she's like woo.

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:38.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.374
So I love this picture.

00:32:39.374 --> 00:32:41.040
This is from another
ball, and remember,

00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:43.370
they were costume balls,
so each year had a theme.

00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.911
[? They're ?] [? looking ?] like
she's like, I hear you, bro,

00:32:45.911 --> 00:32:46.800
but no.

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:48.690
Her body language here
is so interesting,

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:50.910
but this is another
one of the balls,

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:53.700
and then here's Mollie with
Gordon Parks and Gloria

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.470
Vanderbilt at another
one of the balls.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.720
So these are the
major fundraisers.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.060
They were public, and
it was the social event

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:03.030
of the year for
blacks in Harlem,

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:04.950
but also people traveling
from out of town

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.350
to attend this event.

00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:11.720
And by 1955, the year after
Betty Granger's Amsterdam News

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:15.050
series on social leaders,
Mollie's Beaux-Arts ball

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:19.850
had raised nearly $420,000
in today's figures

00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:21.650
for the Urban League.

00:33:21.650 --> 00:33:24.590
And it was one of the most
popular events on the New York

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:26.390
social calendar,
which, as I mentioned,

00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:28.790
brought together
celebrities, everyday folks,

00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:30.960
philanthropists, and so forth.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:33.590
And it was fueled by this
Miss Beaux-Arts pageant, which

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:36.200
is how I stumbled across
Mollie to begin with,

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:38.510
because one of
their pageant queens

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.830
was the face of this
white owned wig shop

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:43.120
that my black nationalist
folk, Kwame Brathwaite,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.530
were protesting against.

00:33:44.530 --> 00:33:47.090
So I was like, this
woman's a Beaux-Arts queen.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.650
What's a Beaux-Arts queen?

00:33:48.650 --> 00:33:51.620
So that's how I found Mollie--
through the pageant, which

00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:54.400
was sponsored by the
Schaefer Brewing Company.

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.850
And they put forth
all this money

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.060
to fund the beauty pageant,
and each year people

00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:02.600
would vote on a slate of
beauty queen contestants.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.520
And they've noted in
the Amsterdam News

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.970
that they would have upwards
of a million people voting

00:34:07.970 --> 00:34:09.739
for the Beaux-Arts
queen, so this just

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.920
gives you a sense of the scope.

00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.500
But I don't want to go on
too much about these balls,

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:18.320
because at the end of the
day, a gala is a gala.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:20.300
A lot of us have been
to those events before.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:23.480
What I have found
fascinating is the emphasis

00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.790
on these fashion shows--

00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:27.980
fashion shows as fundraisers.

00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.389
So they were common in the
early 20th century amongst

00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:38.750
the original black 400 and
people like [? Bernie ?]

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:43.100
[? Austen ?] and Bessye Bearden,
and A'Lelia Walker would host

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:45.320
these events, these
fundraiser events,

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:49.760
that featured the fashions of
a lot of black women designers,

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.780
but with the Great Depression
and then also the rations

00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.220
on textiles during World War II
they kind of fell out of vogue.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:02.090
But when I looked through
some of the clippings

00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:03.890
in terms of where
Mollie was going

00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:05.720
or what the Urban
League Guild was up to,

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:12.290
they decided to host their
Urban League Guild executive

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:15.650
meeting in Chicago during--

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:18.290
to coincide with
the Urban Aid's,

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.350
which was like the local Chicago
version of the Urban League

00:35:21.350 --> 00:35:22.160
Guild--

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.430
their annual fashion show
to see if that model which

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:28.910
had been successful in
Chicago could be a fundraising

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:32.360
model they could
implement in other guilds

00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.430
across the country.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:37.790
So it looks to me that
Mollie does decide

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:41.990
that fashion shows would be
good fundraisers for the Guild,

00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:46.490
and by 1959 not
only are the fashion

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.820
shows regular fundraisers,
Mollie partners

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:53.510
with Eunice Johnson, who is the
founder of the Ebony Fashion

00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:58.840
Fair and wife of John Johnson,
who, of course, owns Johnson

00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.780
Publication-- so Ebony,
Jet, Negro Digest-- to bring

00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.480
the Ebony Fashion Fair
to the Waldorf Astoria

00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:07.512
in New York in 1959.

00:36:07.512 --> 00:36:09.470
And I don't know about
you all, but I grew up--

00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:11.803
we had Ebony Fashion Fair in
my hometown when I grew up.

00:36:11.803 --> 00:36:15.560
It was a big thing, but I never
realized what the fashion fair

00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.010
was other than a fashion fair.

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:22.310
A local organization
would host the fair,

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:24.380
and they would use
the moneys raised

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.980
to support whatever cause
was the cause of that year

00:36:27.980 --> 00:36:29.460
for the organization.

00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:31.850
So by the time
Mollie had brought

00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:34.520
the fashion fair
to New York City,

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.710
the fair had traveled to
51 cities and 31 states.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:42.320
Enter Mary McLeod Bethune,
who I mentioned earlier,

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:46.010
who, at this point
in the late 1940s,

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:50.491
is still the President of the
National Association of Negro

00:36:50.491 --> 00:36:50.990
Women.

00:36:53.940 --> 00:37:00.120
And she sponsors the creation
of the National Association

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.190
of Fashion and
Accessories Designers.

00:37:02.190 --> 00:37:03.950
We'll just call it NAFAD.

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.330
So I say late '40s because
this is when NAFAD is founded.

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.510
So by the time we
get to the late 1950s

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:11.430
when these fashion
shows are very common,

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:15.060
we have an organization
for black women fashion

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.670
and accessories designers.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.450
Now think about this.

00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.030
In this era of Jim Crow,
the fashion industry

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.960
was segregated.

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.730
So these black women
who were trying

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:27.870
to move from being deemed as
seamstresses to being designers

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:30.940
are now trying to get work in
the haute couture industry,

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.130
but they can't find jobs.

00:37:32.130 --> 00:37:35.790
So NAFAD becomes a
vehicle through which

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.520
they can work on
professionalization, where

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:40.200
they can develop their craft.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.760
They can establish and extend
their professional networks.

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.970
And it becomes a place where
they can brand themselves

00:37:47.970 --> 00:37:49.260
as designers.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:52.620
And so NAFAD helped launch
the careers of people

00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:54.810
like Lois Alexander,
who now a lot of people

00:37:54.810 --> 00:38:00.150
know because she designed
Jackie Kennedy's wedding gown.

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:01.380
And Zelda Wynn Valdes--

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.420
I'm writing a piece for
Valdes for the New York

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:07.770
Times that will hopefully
be published in a few days.

00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.630
But they are using these
fashion show fundraisers

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:15.750
as a way to launch their
career, so very much we

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:23.250
see this emphasis on equality
in all types of employment

00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:26.040
industries and the
rise in fashion

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:29.430
shows as fundraisers
as interlocked.

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:33.660
And I think it's
really important

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:36.360
to think about Mary McLeod
Bethune in this moment,

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.540
because I think that the
way we've constructed her

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:43.020
as a woman who's interested
in the equality of women,

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.810
and women's rights, and also
black education-- we wouldn't

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:48.060
associate her with something
like fashion, which

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.800
people think is frivolous.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.060
But what she says--

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:53.850
this is another industry
where black women need work.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.350
This is another
industry where we're

00:38:55.350 --> 00:38:58.560
trying to cast off this
idea of black women

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.160
as servants or in the
servile industries

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.560
that the language
like seamstress

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.770
had historically
evoked for black women.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.410
So I'm still trying
to weave together

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.390
this fashion show
piece, but I think

00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:14.340
it's going to be really
critical to the book--

00:39:14.340 --> 00:39:18.990
this fashion as
fundraiser piece.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.360
I have about five minutes left.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.610
I'm going to conclude here.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.970
So my research assistant
found this article

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:33.140
in the New York Amsterdam
News, and when I saw it,

00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.810
I cracked up,
because does anybody

00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:41.560
know what chitterlings are,
or chitlins, as we call them?

00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:46.910
So sell chitlin dinners
to decorate lobby.

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:49.580
And Mollie's name is
mentioned in this story,

00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.800
and I'm like, whoa, OK.

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.900
Everything that they've
tried to do to create

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:55.530
this image of glamor--

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:57.290
chitlins ain't that.

00:39:57.290 --> 00:39:59.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:01.970
It's these pig intestine
scraps that black folks have

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:05.700
turned into fine cuisine
in our community.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.640
Listen, for people
who still eat pork,

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.430
when the chitlins hit the
table during Thanksgiving,

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:12.420
this is a big deal.

00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.920
My mom thinks she
can make chitlins.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.844
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:17.287 --> 00:40:19.120
I don't eat pork no
more, so I don't even

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.570
have to contend with that.

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.510
I don't have to tell
her if she can or can't.

00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:25.030
I don't think she
probably can, though.

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.690
So to me, when I think
about this idea of selling

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:32.590
chitlin dinners, this type of
fundraising that we associate

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.270
with the black church--

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.610
when you have a building
fund, it takes you 10 years,

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:40.330
and you still haven't built
one new part of the building,

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:42.970
but it's funded off of these
chicken dinners, and chitlin

00:40:42.970 --> 00:40:44.780
dinners, and so on and so forth.

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.110
So the fact that they
were using this language

00:40:47.110 --> 00:40:49.410
to talk about society
women I found interesting.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.170
Now, if you look at the
year here, this is 1973.

00:40:52.170 --> 00:40:54.670
And so for me, I'm intrigued
not just by the chitlins piece,

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:59.190
but by the year,
because by '73 when

00:40:59.190 --> 00:41:03.360
we're in this kind of height of
the black power and soul era,

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.280
you have these
socialite women who

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.852
are reclaiming these quaint
southern culinary traditions.

00:41:09.852 --> 00:41:12.060
And I thought this was really
interesting, especially

00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.490
after reading all this stuff
and learning information

00:41:14.490 --> 00:41:18.990
about all the top black
women caterers who would

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.030
cater these private events.

00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.070
I've learned so much
about vintage champagne,

00:41:23.070 --> 00:41:24.540
because that was
the thing to have.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.670
Everybody had vintage champagne.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:28.980
Gordon Parks threw a
party at his summer house

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.590
where he had 12 cases
of vintage champagne,

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.520
and 100 pounds of
barbecued chicken,

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.630
and so on and so forth.

00:41:36.630 --> 00:41:38.910
So to see this piece
that's dealing with--

00:41:38.910 --> 00:41:41.760
that's talking about
selling chitlin dinners

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.230
to decorate a lobby.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:45.930
It's one of these coteries
who probably came up

00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.050
the ranks through the fashion
shows that Molly hosted who's

00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:53.220
trying to redecorate the lobby
of her high rise apartments

00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:54.420
in Harlem.

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.580
And so they're selling chitlin
dinners as a way to do this.

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:01.290
And so I'm intrigued by
this because I want to know,

00:42:01.290 --> 00:42:04.860
is there another shift that
happens in black society

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.850
life in the 1970s?

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:10.560
Where does this story go?

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.930
Because I feel like I'm
starting to get a handle

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.510
on Mollie's
generation, how they're

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:18.480
defining glamor, and high
society, and black life,

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:22.460
and who gets to be
in, and who isn't in.

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:25.197
But what happens when we get to
that black power movement era

00:42:25.197 --> 00:42:26.780
where there starts
to be more pushback

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:29.870
against interracial
activism, when

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:33.170
the critiques against
capitalism and imperialism

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.110
reach this fever pitch?

00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:38.330
I want to know what happens to
Mollie and people of her ilk.

00:42:38.330 --> 00:42:40.850
We know Mollie still
continues to be

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.980
the president of the
Urban League Guild

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:46.435
because she reigns for 50 years.

00:42:46.435 --> 00:42:47.810
That is a long time.

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:48.650
I'm sorry.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.870
Every time I hear that figure--

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:53.610
but I'm interested to see
what changes, because--

00:42:53.610 --> 00:42:54.860
I guess I do have two minutes.

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:57.800
I can say this.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.830
The book end for me in terms of
how I'm thinking about it now--

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.720
who knows what will
happen when it actually

00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:04.070
becomes a book project?

00:43:04.070 --> 00:43:08.270
But Desiree Rogers, for
me, is an important figure

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:12.040
that links the Mollie Moon
era with this more present

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:13.460
and contemporary moment.

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:17.630
She's the first social secretary
of the Obama administration,

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.240
and she's from New Orleans.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.150
She's a self-proclaimed
descendant of New Orleans

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.455
voodoo queen and
socialite Marie Laveau,

00:43:25.455 --> 00:43:26.830
but doesn't
everybody say they're

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:28.430
the descendant of Marie Laveau?

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.910
Everybody says that, right?

00:43:29.910 --> 00:43:34.640
But she's claiming there's a
certain multigenerational tie

00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:39.770
to hosting and being able to
work closely with the most

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.640
powerful people in a society.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:45.650
And so she's saying I come
from a particular tradition

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:46.850
of fundraising.

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:50.330
And so before she
becomes social secretary,

00:43:50.330 --> 00:43:53.060
she gets the gig because
of her uncanny ability

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:57.410
to raise money for
Obama's 2008 campaign.

00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:59.570
So this Harvard
MBA hosted events

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:02.660
for Chicago's white and black
business elite in her home

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:04.280
and used her training
and marketing

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.100
to, quote unquote, "brand"
Obama for the social media

00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:10.700
generation, but her visibility
also made her a target.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:14.690
I don't know if you all
remember that two reality TV

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.780
stars crashed the White
House state dinner,

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:21.884
and Desiree Rogers is forced to
fall on her sword and resign.

00:44:21.884 --> 00:44:23.300
But part of the
reason why I think

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:26.060
that she's forced to resign
is because she's so visible.

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:29.510
Here's an article of her on the
cover of Wall Street Journal.

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.520
Before we were thinking
about Michelle Obama

00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:35.870
as this fashionista
and beauty image,

00:44:35.870 --> 00:44:38.300
it was Desiree Rogers who was
branding herself like this.

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.670
In true black
society woman form,

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:44.720
she was using the media as a
way to not only brand Obama,

00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:47.270
but brand herself,
and social secretaries

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:48.500
had never before done that.

00:44:48.500 --> 00:44:50.810
How many social
secretaries can you name?

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:52.250
But you can name her.

00:44:52.250 --> 00:44:53.990
And she goes on
after she's dismissed

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:56.510
to become the CEO of
Johnson Publications.

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:59.060
So I think that is very
interesting, because we've

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.700
seen how Mollie
partnered with Johnson

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:04.850
Publications and the
Ebony Fashion Fair

00:45:04.850 --> 00:45:06.510
in the mid 20th century.

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:10.850
So this just shows how small
this black elite community is.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.860
So I'm trying to
figure out, what

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:17.520
is this meaty middle
tissue in the '70s, '80s,

00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:22.010
and early '90s that gives us
someone like a Desiree Rogers

00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:25.670
and someone who still sees
herself as very much wedded

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:29.000
to these traditions
of socialite activism

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.070
and fundraising of
her foremothers?

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.510
Thank you.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:36.460
[APPLAUSE]
