00:00:01.376 --> 00:00:03.044
- All right, I think

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:12.011
What in the hell are
you doing, Chumlee?

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.222
Building something
for your son.

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.391
Hey, there he is.

00:00:16.391 --> 00:00:17.559
What's this?

00:00:17.559 --> 00:00:21.855
Check it out, the
"USS Chum," that

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:24.983
submarine you always wanted.

00:00:24.983 --> 00:00:26.359
Um.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.403
That is a dumbest
looking submarine

00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:30.321
I've ever seen in my life.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.407
You ordered yourself
food, and have no money.

00:00:32.407 --> 00:00:33.700
Well, I thought I
had my wallet here.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.160
But I left my
wallet in my house.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.453
I thought it was in my car.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.121
Anyways, can I borrow 20 bucks?

00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:39.330
Hold on.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.915
I got the pizza
on the way already.

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:42.709
Here, sign that.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.419
What is that?

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:47.172
It's promissory note, proof
that you borrowed $20 from me.

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:49.424
You will get this note
back when you pay me back.

00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:51.050
Now, sign that.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.470
So whoever holds that note,
I have to pay 20 bucks to?

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.679
It's the way
promissory notes work.

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.265
Do you understand?

00:00:57.265 --> 00:01:01.519
You get this back
when you pay me back.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.731
Where's the promissory
note I had you sign?

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.066
You owe me 20
bucks now because I

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.026
bear the promissory note.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.240
Why are you in my seat?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.034
FRANKENSTEIN: [inaudible].

00:01:16.034 --> 00:01:18.244
RICK: Is that thing merchandise?

00:01:18.244 --> 00:01:19.913
Every time someone
says anything

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.248
to him for the past hour, he
just pulls the cord on that.

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:25.043
RICK: Go put it away.

00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.337
FRANKENSTEIN: You re so cute.

00:01:27.337 --> 00:01:28.630
I'm green with envy.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.173
Chumlee, go in the back.

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:31.341
I have a bone record.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.303
CHUMLEE: What is a bone record?

00:01:35.303 --> 00:01:37.013
It's an X-ray.

00:01:37.013 --> 00:01:39.432
It's like an X-ray record that
they use for like band music

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:41.601
back in the day.

00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.020
RICK: You know, it's definitely
an X-ray of something,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.647
it looks like.

00:01:45.647 --> 00:01:46.856
CHUMLEE: Looks like boobs.

00:01:46.856 --> 00:01:48.817
CUSTOMER: It's not boobs.

00:01:48.817 --> 00:01:50.693
Maybe I'm just seeing things.

00:01:50.693 --> 00:01:52.570
RICK: Chum, what are you doing?

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.113
Working.

00:01:54.113 --> 00:01:55.240
You're making
a paper airplane.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.282
That's not working.

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:57.534
I'm at work.

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.493
I'm getting paid to be here.

00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.791
It doesn't fit.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.376
Actually, it fits
you pretty good

00:02:06.376 --> 00:02:09.546
and hides the fact
that you're bald.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:11.673
You're making a board game now?

00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:14.968
Yeah, it's called Chum Life.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.011
There's nothing on it, Chum.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.765
I was hoping you guys would
kind of help me, you know,

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:23.685
fill the squares out and get the
idea of the game a little bit.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:29.149
What about takes boss's truck
to get lunch and wrecks it.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.986
I've got some
rare whistles here.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.612
RICK: OK.

00:02:34.612 --> 00:02:37.657
[blows whistles]
Sounds like a train.

00:02:37.657 --> 00:02:39.200
[blows whistles]

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.537
RICK: I hear it, Chum.

00:02:42.537 --> 00:02:44.497
That's definitely
a train whistle.

00:02:44.497 --> 00:02:47.167
I actually went out and bought
a new pair of shoes last night.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:48.126
So I'm going to write those off.

00:02:49.627 --> 00:02:50.795
RICK: How are you going
to write off shoes?

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.298
I have to wear
them to work, duh.

00:02:53.298 --> 00:02:55.133
RICK: There's Chum.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.010
This is what you looks
like in night vision.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.430
This is what I look
like at night, too.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.848
[laughs]

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:05.810
I just spent a lot of
money on two $500 bills.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.229
That's dumb they're
only worth $1,000.

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.608
RICK: [sighs] Do you know
about the Battle of the Bulge?

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:15.320
I think it was like
December 16, 1944.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.946
And I know it was
like a pretty big

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:20.575
battle on the Western Front.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:22.493
Um, yeah.

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:24.454
Every once in a while
you shock me, Chum.

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:26.873
I'm the luckiest
person in the world.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:28.541
Why are you so lucky?

00:03:28.541 --> 00:03:30.335
Obviously he's lucky.

00:03:30.335 --> 00:03:32.962
10 years, he's still here.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:36.716
CHUMLEE: Pretty
awesome, isn't it, Rick?

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:37.717
Yeah.
