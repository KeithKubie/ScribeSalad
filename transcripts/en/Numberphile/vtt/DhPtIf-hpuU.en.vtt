00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.810
We're going to talk about triperfect numbers. Triperfect numbers‽

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.090
We've heard of perfect numbers, haven't we? We've done that on Numberphile before. It was one of our first ones, wasn't it?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.690
I think we need to do a quick . . .

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.299
recap of what a perfect number is because that's going to be relevant to what a triperfect number is.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:23.100
So a perfect number is a number like six. Six is a perfect number and that's because factors of 6 are:

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.440
1, 2, 3, and 6 itself.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.680
In fact, what we're going to do: we're going to ignore the number itself. If we add up the other factors:

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.869
So we'll have 1 + 2 + 3.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.380
We're going to end up with the original number. We're going to have 6.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:42.600
The next perfect number is 28, and it works the same way.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.500
If you look at the factors of 28 and add them up you'll get the original number.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:58.760
The next one is going to be 496: that's a perfect number. The next one after that is 8128, and they keep going, right.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.220
So they are quite rare. We think there's infinitely many of them, but we've found 50 so far.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:13.600
The largest one we've found is the most recent, which is a perfect number that is 46 million digits long.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.199
So we do think there's infinitely many of them.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:26.000
Although we haven't proven that to be true, and all the perfect numbers we've found are even. We haven't found an odd perfect number yet.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.569
So that's something that hasn't been proven yet.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.209
But this definition I gave you was kind of weird because I ignored the number itself.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.049
So I said out of all the factors except the number itself

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.720
You could just add all the factors including the number itself. That's perfectly fine,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.540
and then you could say a perfect number is: you add up all the factors and you get double the original number. That's absolutely fine.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.340
What happens if we add up all the factors and get triple the number?

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.020
That is a triperfect number. Well, the smallest triperfect number is 120.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.460
If we look at the factors of 120,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.960
you have:

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.100
and we'll include 120 itself.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.700
So those are the factors of 120 and if you add them up you will get 360.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.929
You will get 3 times the original number. So that is the first try perfect number.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:39.400
Let me write out the next few. Let's start a list here with 120 and the next one is 672.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:49.000
The next triperfect number after that is 523 776.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:59.400
The next one after that is 459 818 240.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.600
The next one after that is  1 476 304 896.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.700
and the next one after that—I might put this one in—I'll put it here:

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.660
So I've got six there, written out and that's all of them.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.389
That's all we know and we also think that's a complete list. We think there's finitely many of them.

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.869
We think there's six of them only. That is a complete list.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:40.600
There are six triperfect numbers. Now, that's not proven, but we really do believe that this is a complete list.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.690
Couple of reasons for this.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.200
We have searched for them, and we've searched quite a long way. We've searched huge numbers,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.820
like numbers that are 350 digits long, like really big numbers, but they just stop.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.999
So we have a triperfect number in the hundreds. We have triperfect numbers in the thousands.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.900
We have them in the millions.

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.900
We have them in the billions,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.520
and then they just stop and it would be really weird if there was a some . . . some . . . some sort of massive triperfect number

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.600
so there's this massive, massive gap and then another triperfect number suddenly appears.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:22.280
That would be really weird if that's true. Now we don't know that this is a complete list,

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:29.509
but it would be really weird if it wasn't a complete list. And there is other reasons why we think

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.330
this is complete list because it's also related to

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.079
perfect numbers. In fact it's related to odd perfect numbers. If you remember I said we haven't found any odd

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.520
perfect numbers yet.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.949
And there is a relation between odd perfect numbers and triperfect numbers.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:54.300
If you had a number. Let's just call it n, and if that is odd perfect,  then 2n is triperfect.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.000
So that means that if we do find an odd perfect number one day, and it's going to be massive if we ever find it.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.259
If we find it one day, then automatically we're going to find a new triperfect number.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.210
So either we're going to find this odd perfect number and this list is not complete after all,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:18.400
or this list is complete which means that aren't any odd perfect numbers,

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.000
which we also believe—not proven—but we strongly believe that's true.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.580
BRADY: James, are there quadperfect numbers?

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.500
I'm glad you asked, because yes, absolutely.

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.849
So there are 4-perfect numbers, 5-perfect numbers. Shall I show you them. We can look at them. I've got them. Yeah.

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:36.849
BRADY: That wasn't set up! I thought that was a real question.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.800
The smallest 4-perfect number that we know is 30 240.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.409
So if you look at the factors of that number and add them up

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.140
you'll get four times the original number.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:59.700
There are 36 known 4-perfect numbers, and then the list just stops again, and then we can't find any more,

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.369
so we think, again, we've got a finite list here, and we think we have all

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:08.509
the 4-perfect numbers. You can take it a step further, of course.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:21.600
Look at 5-perfect numbers. The smallest 5-perfect number is 14 182 439 040.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.840
There's sixty five of those, that we know of, that we've found, and again, it's the same thing.

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.479
It looks like it's a finite list because we found 65 of them, and then it just stops and we can't find any more.

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:38.960
So we think that's a finite list as well. Same is true for 6-perfect numbers and 7-perfect numbers.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.229
We think we found a complete list then they just stop.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.879
