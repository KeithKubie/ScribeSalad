00:00:04.046 --> 00:00:06.656
&gt;&gt;Georgia: I realize how
much more they learn,

00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:09.736
so when I see that they take action
and they're applying the skills

00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:14.266
that they learn in here, I feel
like I've done my job as a teacher.

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:17.416
&gt;&gt;At your service, all right.

00:00:21.616 --> 00:00:25.746
&gt;&gt;Monica: Inquiry based learning is
just a fancy word for curiosity, right?

00:00:26.106 --> 00:00:28.466
So tell me what child is not curious.

00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:32.786
&gt;&gt;Georgia: We as humans all
question, that's how we learn.

00:00:32.876 --> 00:00:36.326
So the students should be
questioning all the time.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:38.936
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: Any questions?

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.736
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: We're trying to
ignite passion and relevance.

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:47.096
It's not just about finishing that
assignment, it's about being able

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:49.406
to explore something that
I'm really interested in.

00:00:51.496 --> 00:00:56.696
&gt;&gt;Monica: The basic steps in
inquiry based learning is to come

00:00:56.696 --> 00:01:01.146
up with a rich question, a question that
doesn't have the answer already in it.

00:01:01.656 --> 00:01:04.776
&gt;&gt;Georgia: You begin with the questions
that you really want to explore

00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:09.436
in a unit, and then each
unit has lines of inquiry

00:01:09.726 --> 00:01:11.406
that the students will be investigating.

00:01:11.556 --> 00:01:16.496
And the lines of inquiry are developed
by the teacher but with a lot of input

00:01:16.496 --> 00:01:18.356
and feedback from the students.

00:01:18.356 --> 00:01:20.336
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: And that
becomes the direction

00:01:20.336 --> 00:01:23.596
that the teacher takes the content,
so the teacher will resource kids

00:01:23.596 --> 00:01:26.526
with opportunities to explore
things that they're interested

00:01:26.526 --> 00:01:28.256
in within that line of inquiry.

00:01:28.796 --> 00:01:34.406
So kids are hitting the standards with
the bigger questions and being able

00:01:34.406 --> 00:01:37.686
to create evidence of their
understandings and their learnings

00:01:37.876 --> 00:01:40.586
in all kinds of ways that
the kids get to pick.

00:01:40.906 --> 00:01:43.626
&gt;&gt;Georgia: So for instance, we're
doing a money unit right now,

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:45.526
we're studying billionaires.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:49.306
The theme billionaires was not
chosen by the teachers per se,

00:01:49.306 --> 00:01:52.296
it stemmed from the students' inquiries.

00:01:52.506 --> 00:01:54.816
When we were going through
the inquiry process

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:56.866
and they were asking
all these questions,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:01.306
a common theme that kept coming up
was, why are some people so rich

00:02:01.306 --> 00:02:02.826
and other people are not rich?

00:02:02.826 --> 00:02:06.656
&gt;&gt;I remember a lot of you were
wondering why some people don't have

00:02:06.656 --> 00:02:07.826
as much money, remember that?

00:02:08.456 --> 00:02:08.836
&gt;&gt;Students: Yeah.

00:02:08.836 --> 00:02:12.076
&gt;&gt;Georgia: So those questions
led to our investigation.

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:16.286
&gt;&gt;We had a huge discussion about why
we're studying billionaires and it's not

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:19.766
because they're super humans or
that they're rich or they're cool

00:02:19.766 --> 00:02:20.886
because they have a lot of money.

00:02:21.286 --> 00:02:24.376
We're looking at character
traits and we're talking

00:02:24.376 --> 00:02:28.976
about what do these people have that
enables them to be this successful?

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:33.266
&gt;&gt;Student: You're doing a
keynote about Ralph Lauren's cars.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.236
He has a giant car collection.

00:02:35.366 --> 00:02:38.876
&gt;&gt;Bobby: We're asking ourselves some
questions and then we would have looked

00:02:38.876 --> 00:02:41.406
on Wikipedia and searched
up the questions.

00:02:41.686 --> 00:02:44.206
Maybe one day we want
to invent something.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:50.246
&gt;&gt;Student: This right here is how
Warren Buffett influenced society

00:02:50.246 --> 00:02:53.386
about what he did, how much
money he gave to charity.

00:02:53.386 --> 00:02:55.866
&gt;&gt;Student: How about this one?

00:02:56.156 --> 00:02:58.906
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Why would I really care about
someone donating money to a charity?

00:02:59.276 --> 00:03:05.966
&gt;&gt;Student: Because she helped someone
and then she built a school for girls.

00:03:06.046 --> 00:03:08.776
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: We're opening up
learning by letting kids decide, "Hey,

00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:10.636
what am I really interested in science?

00:03:10.826 --> 00:03:12.456
What am I really interested
in social studies?

00:03:12.456 --> 00:03:13.756
What am I really interested
in literature?"

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:17.866
giving them a whole list of potential
things and letting them do the inquiry

00:03:17.866 --> 00:03:20.976
and research and make those connections.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:21.746
&gt;&gt;Jonathan: So if you have a dystopia,

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:24.596
you could say that "Hunger Games"
would be one of your resources

00:03:24.596 --> 00:03:29.636
because it's a fiction story that
actually plays out in a dystopia region.

00:03:29.636 --> 00:03:32.526
&gt;&gt;Inquiry based learning actually
makes you think, essentially.

00:03:33.256 --> 00:03:35.856
You're still doing it
in the common core way,

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.916
but you're actually picking
what you want to learn.

00:03:38.276 --> 00:03:39.486
&gt;&gt;Mary Beth: All of a
sudden, our students,

00:03:39.616 --> 00:03:42.686
we see our students doing things
that really matter to them

00:03:42.686 --> 00:03:44.896
and they're excited and they're
passionate and they want to talk

00:03:44.896 --> 00:03:45.826
about what they're learning.

00:03:45.966 --> 00:03:50.136
&gt;&gt;Monica: They're inspired,
they're reflective, they struggle.

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:52.776
That is a true education.
