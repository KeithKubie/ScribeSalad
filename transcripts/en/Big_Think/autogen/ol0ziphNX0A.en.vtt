working in government what I wanted to
 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.389
working in government what I wanted to
do was come up was produce a book that

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399
do was come up was produce a book that
 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:50.069

they wanted to accomplish and figure out
 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.450
they wanted to accomplish and figure out
how to accomplish it and the model I

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460
how to accomplish it and the model I
 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.580
how to accomplish it and the model I
came up with was a compass that

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590
came up with was a compass that
 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.530
came up with was a compass that
everybody had to think about their North

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540
everybody had to think about their North
 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.660
everybody had to think about their North
which was their bosses their South their

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670
which was their bosses their South their
 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.910
which was their bosses their South their
staff their East their colleagues and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920
staff their East their colleagues and
 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.130
staff their East their colleagues and
their West which were those outside

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140
their West which were those outside
 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.780
their West which were those outside
their organization but they still had to

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790
their organization but they still had to
 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.790
their organization but they still had to
interact with how they had to work off

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800
interact with how they had to work off
 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.410
interact with how they had to work off
of those four directions of their

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420
of those four directions of their
 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.870
of those four directions of their
compass to help them figure out what it

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880
compass to help them figure out what it
 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.120
compass to help them figure out what it
was they could accomplish and to help

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130
was they could accomplish and to help
 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.410
was they could accomplish and to help
pave the way to - to accomplishing it

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420
pave the way to - to accomplishing it
 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.020
pave the way to - to accomplishing it
and that that was essentially the the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030
and that that was essentially the the
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.570
and that that was essentially the the
model or the structure and I interviewed

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580
model or the structure and I interviewed
 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.890
model or the structure and I interviewed
a lot of people and looked at a lot of

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900
a lot of people and looked at a lot of
 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.740
a lot of people and looked at a lot of
people and essentially said what what

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750
people and essentially said what what
 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.480
people and essentially said what what
explains why some intelligent people

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490
explains why some intelligent people
 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.750
explains why some intelligent people
succeed and others fail and I wrote it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760
