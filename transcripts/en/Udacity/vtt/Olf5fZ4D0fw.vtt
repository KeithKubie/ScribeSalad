00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The tricky thing about this problem is that I don't know if I need to break it into two parts or not.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Will the bicyclist catch up with the runner in the first 4 s?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Or will it take more than that? I just don't know.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
But what I can do is figure out how far the bicyclist and how far the runner will go in those first 4 s.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
And if the bicyclist's distance is greater than or equal to the runner's, I know he's caught up.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And then I can just worry about this being a one part problem.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So let's see. How far will the bicyclist go in 4 s?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This is the same calculation we did in the first problem, and it's 24 m.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
And I can use the same equation to describe the runner's motion with an acceleration of 0

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and an initial velocity of 6, the runner goes 24 m.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
She's gone just as far as the bicyclist has, so it turns out by luck

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
that after 4 s the bicyclist catches up with the runner.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Note that both the runner and the cyclist have gone 24 m in the first 4 s.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It's interesting to notice that this 24 m is actually equal to the area underneath this triangle

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and also the area underneath this rectangle.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
This isn't a coincidence but rather an important physical fact.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
If you've ever taken a calculus class or plan to take one in the future,

00:01:04.000 --> 99:59:59.000
you can learn more about why this exciting phenomenon happens.
