00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We know that acceleration is somehow special,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
but how is acceleration special?

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's think of a cart, and we want to accelerate this cart.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Accelerating it would make us happy.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If we want to design an experiment to test what factors affect acceleration--let's think.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When I push this cart what factors will control at what rate it accelerates?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Does it matter how hard I push?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Does it matter what material the cart is made of?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Does the mass of the cart matter?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Will a heavier cart maybe accelerate at a different rate?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Does the color of the cart matter?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Will a red paint job make the cart accelerate faster?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
To get you thinking about this, I want you to choose all that you think apply.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
When you see the answer, you maybe surprised

00:00:38.000 --> 99:59:59.000
at whether or not it matches with your intuition.
