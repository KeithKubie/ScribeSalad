00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:05.467
SPACE IS AN INTERESTING THING.

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.567
IT'S AN UNKNOWN.
IT'S A FRONTIER.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:09.100
I THINK THE BIG MYSTERY TO ME

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.567
IS FINDING OTHER LIFE
IN THE UNIVERSE.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.634
BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT THERE IS LIFE OUT THERE.

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:15.100
IN FACT, I BELIEVE
THERE'S A LOT OF LIFE

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.300
OUT IN THE UNIVERSE.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.901
THE UNIVERSE,
FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES,

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:19.000
IS INFINITE.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.234
AND SO IT'D BE
THE HEIGHT OF ARROGANCE

00:00:20.234 --> 00:00:21.934
TO THINK THAT WE
HERE ON THE EARTH

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:26.100
ARE THE ONLY LIFE IN THIS
BASICALLY INFINITE UNIVERSE.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.167
WHEN YOU DO THE MATH,
YOU CAN SAY,

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:31.968
"THERE ARE PROBABLY
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PLANETS

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:33.434
THAT CAN SUPPORT LIFE."

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:35.033
THE PARADOX IS,

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:38.200
IF YOU HAVE THAT MANY PLANETS
THAT CAN SUPPORT LIFE

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:39.434
IN A UNIVERSE,

00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:41.667
WHERE ARE ALL THE ALIENS?

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.734
Bean: PART OF EXPLORATION IS

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:49.067
HOPING YOU SEE SOMETHING
THAT YOU DIDN'T EXPECT.

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.267
I CAN REMEMBER WALKING AROUND
ON THE MOON

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:56.400
WISHING I COULD LOOK DOWN
AND SEE AN ARROWHEAD

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.334
OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD SAY

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:01.968
"ANCIENT CIVILIZATION WAS HERE."

00:01:01.968 --> 00:01:04.601
THE DISTANCES ARE SO VAST

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:06.767
THAT WE MAY NEVER FIND
EACH OTHER.

00:01:06.767 --> 00:01:10.934
WE MAY BE HUNDREDS OR EVEN MORE
MILLIONS OF LIGHT-YEARS APART.

00:01:10.934 --> 00:01:13.267
AND SO THE IDEA THAT
WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:15.801
SOME SIGNAL OR SOME INDICATION

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:17.868
THAT THERE IS OTHER LIFE
OUT THERE...
