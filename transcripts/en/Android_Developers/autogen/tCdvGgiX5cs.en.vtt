00:00:09.987 --> 00:00:11.570
 SIMON HADE: When we started Space Ape, 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.390
 it was definitely smaller. 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.000
 We were only 12 people. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.115
 Now we are 55. 

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.115
 TOBY MOORE: Building mobile games was something new for us, 

00:00:18.115 --> 00:00:20.140
 but we had a lot of experience building games in general. 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.710
 We only had to learn very quickly. 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.959
 That's why we had to use it as a learning platform 

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.590
 while we made a video game for our users. 

00:00:28.142 --> 00:00:29.850
 JOE REABURN: We all discussed ideas 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.310
 of what makes everything a fighting strategy game fun. 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.740
 And we're really simply crazy about Japan. 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.190
 And we love Japanese and Oriental fantasy. 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.790
 JOHN EARNER: "Samurai Siege" is about building and fighting. 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.620
 You build a fortress. 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.222
 You make it stronger. 

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:46.180
 And you try to defend it against other players 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.971
 trying to steal resources from you. 

00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:51.810
 And you fight against them again and steal their resources. 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.790
 SIMON HADE: Our ambitions for "Samurai Siege" were pretty good 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.830
 modest when we started with it. 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.080
 We initially introduced it to Australia and New Zealand. 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.090
 Then we had a grace period of about six weeks. 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.760
 JOHN EARNER: Within two weeks of making the game available in beta, 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.180
 We were already making $ 10,000 gross per day. 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.250
 And so we have made it available worldwide. 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.230
 And within a month we had about 300,000 people daily. 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.750
 And monthly about 1.5 million people played the game. 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.202
 And by that time we knew 

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:18.140
 that we are bitter. 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.220
 Nowadays we make about $ 55,000 a day. 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.980
 Weekends are rising. 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.960
 On our most successful day, we made $ 220,000, 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.430
 which is a small number at the same time as comparing it 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.880
 with some of the biggest gaming companies that exist, 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.072
 but really good if you are 18 or 24 months old 

00:01:34.072 --> 00:01:36.030
 and you start getting started with one 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.904
 of your first titles. 

00:01:36.904 --> 00:01:38.635
 That's why we're pretty excited about it. 

00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:41.010
 SIMON HADE: Android's share of our revenue increases. 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.540
 That's 50%. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.310
 Much of the growth stems from our focus on Asia. 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.016
 I think 10% to 15% of our income comes from Japan alone. 

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:50.640
 JOE REABURN: We always planned 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.810
 "Samurai Siege" to take to Japan. 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.310
 We just wanted to make sure we did it right because we 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.810
 knew we had one chance with one of the world's largest 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.310
 game markets. 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.684
 JOHN EARNER: We've been to Japan for four months 

00:01:58.684 --> 00:01:59.980
 on the launch. 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.272
 And the game was basically available everywhere else. 

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:03.729
 JOE REABURN: One of the reasons is 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.660
 that we spent a lot of time locating our game 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.320
 and to be ready for culture; a translation of many 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.360
 to have high quality. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.930
 JOHN EARNER: We've learned how users see ads. 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.600
 We learned what they think of the game. 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.820
 We were in beta in Japan for a month to test it. 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.340
 SIMON HADE: That's why we had to find local people 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.839
 what would keep our game, what 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:21.660
 could be ambassadors for us. 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.510
 And after we made it available, they were really 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.039
 the voice of our players in Japan. 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.830
 JOE REABURN: The alpha and beta test feature 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.610
 in the Google Play Developer Console is a good approach to follow. 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.350
 So you can pick a group of people yourself 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.330
 associated with the Google group. 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.496
 And then you can get user feedback. 

00:02:37.496 --> 00:02:40.265
 You start to see how your game is in the real world. 

00:02:40.265 --> 00:02:42.880
 We wanted our marketing material in the Google Play Store 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.990
 Looks like a local Japanese company does it 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.330
 created, which are actually more exclamation marks 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.090
 and mean cute characters. 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.765
 We used our internal Japanese staff to tell us what it should look like. 

00:02:54.765 --> 00:02:56.040
 And we put it together. 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.332
 And in the end it really looks cute, really exciting. 

00:02:58.332 --> 00:03:00.373
 TOBY MOORE: Google Play is a great platform 

00:03:00.373 --> 00:03:01.260
 to develop with. 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.100
 I really enjoy the high repetition rate and how 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.100
 Thinking about bringing games to the Google Play Store, 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.040
 and working with the partnership team. 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.373
 JOHN EARNER: The experience with Google Play is great. 

00:03:11.373 --> 00:03:12.920
 We found it about half 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.706
 heard from us and half of us are business. 

00:03:15.706 --> 00:03:18.330
 Although the success we have achieved so far is how exciting, 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.680
 is the thing we really look forward to, that next step, 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.470
 what lies ahead. 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.470
 I think what keeps people in games, 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.884
 is always the excitement of working on the next game 

00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:26.800
 and see that it is made available. 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.200
 And so I look to the next one. 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.650
