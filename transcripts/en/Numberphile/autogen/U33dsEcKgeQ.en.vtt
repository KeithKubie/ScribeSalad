00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.640
 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650
so the first thing we're going to do is
 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.740
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're gonna draw some graph so I don't

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750
we're gonna draw some graph so I don't
 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.599
we're gonna draw some graph so I don't
care what it looks like let's try it

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609
care what it looks like let's try it
 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.310
care what it looks like let's try it
put a few vertices here and some edges

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320
put a few vertices here and some edges
 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.350
put a few vertices here and some edges
connect it up nicely okay so there's a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360
connect it up nicely okay so there's a
 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.110
connect it up nicely okay so there's a
graph and now I'm gonna give each vertex

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
graph and now I'm gonna give each vertex
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.300
graph and now I'm gonna give each vertex
of my graph a number and again you can

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310
of my graph a number and again you can
 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.890
of my graph a number and again you can
just choose this randomly and it can

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900
just choose this randomly and it can
 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.080
just choose this randomly and it can
even be a negative number okay so let's

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
even be a negative number okay so let's
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.380
even be a negative number okay so let's
say I've got negative two here I don't

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390
say I've got negative two here I don't
 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.269
say I've got negative two here I don't
know what do you want here right three

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
know what do you want here right three
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.509
know what do you want here right three
and one

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519
and one
 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.620
and one
and how about minus one and I don't know

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
and how about minus one and I don't know
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.020
and how about minus one and I don't know
another two so here's the rules of the

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
another two so here's the rules of the
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.319
another two so here's the rules of the
game the goal is to make sure that none

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
game the goal is to make sure that none
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.150
game the goal is to make sure that none
of the vertices have negative numbers

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
of the vertices have negative numbers
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.520
of the vertices have negative numbers
anymore okay so you can think of this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530
anymore okay so you can think of this
 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500
anymore okay so you can think of this
this one name for this game is $1 game

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
this one name for this game is $1 game
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.970
this one name for this game is $1 game
which is that you can imagine this as

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
which is that you can imagine this as
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.889
which is that you can imagine this as
five people and they have this amount of

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
five people and they have this amount of
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.720
five people and they have this amount of
money some of them are in debt some of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730
money some of them are in debt some of
 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670
money some of them are in debt some of
them are not and the moves that you can

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680
them are not and the moves that you can
 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.189
them are not and the moves that you can
make in the game are that either a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199
make in the game are that either a
 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.099
make in the game are that either a
person can donate money meaning for each

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109
person can donate money meaning for each
 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.889
person can donate money meaning for each
vertex that they're connected to they

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899
vertex that they're connected to they
 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.139
vertex that they're connected to they
can give a dollar or a person can take

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149
can give a dollar or a person can take
 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.119
can give a dollar or a person can take
money meaning for each vertex that

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129
money meaning for each vertex that
 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.620
money meaning for each vertex that
they're connected to they can take a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630
they're connected to they can take a
 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.840
they're connected to they can take a
dollar and the goal of the game is to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
dollar and the goal of the game is to
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.010
dollar and the goal of the game is to
make sure that everyone's out of debt

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
make sure that everyone's out of debt
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.200
make sure that everyone's out of debt
and no peeking or choosing if you give

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
and no peeking or choosing if you give
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.580
and no peeking or choosing if you give
or take you have to give or take from

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590
or take you have to give or take from
 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.080
or take you have to give or take from
everyone you're connected to that's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090
everyone you're connected to that's
 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.039
everyone you're connected to that's
right that's right

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049
right that's right
 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.230
right that's right
so let's take a look at this example

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
so let's take a look at this example
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.780
so let's take a look at this example
that we've drawn here and see if we can

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790
that we've drawn here and see if we can
 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.190
that we've drawn here and see if we can
win this game so what do you think we

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200
win this game so what do you think we
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.410
win this game so what do you think we
should do well I think three person has

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
should do well I think three person has
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.080
should do well I think three person has
to give good ok so let's do that let me

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
to give good ok so let's do that let me
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.310
to give good ok so let's do that let me
do a different color so we don't get

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
do a different color so we don't get
 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.179
do a different color so we don't get
confused okay so if 3 goes that means 3

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
confused okay so if 3 goes that means 3
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.740
confused okay so if 3 goes that means 3
goes down to 0 mmm

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750
goes down to 0 mmm
 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.179
goes down to 0 mmm
2 goes up to 3 1 goes up to 2 but here's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
2 goes up to 3 1 goes up to 2 but here's
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.530
2 goes up to 3 1 goes up to 2 but here's
something good which is that this is now

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540
something good which is that this is now
 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.469
something good which is that this is now
negative 1 instead of negative 2 which

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
negative 1 instead of negative 2 which
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910
negative 1 instead of negative 2 which
is better for getting everyone out of

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920
is better for getting everyone out of
 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.330
is better for getting everyone out of
debt now what should we do that three

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340
debt now what should we do that three
 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.100
debt now what should we do that three
needs should give a cross written yeah

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
needs should give a cross written yeah
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.660
needs should give a cross written yeah
we've got all these extra money over

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670
we've got all these extra money over
 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.510
we've got all these extra money over
here and so why don't we move some of it

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520
here and so why don't we move some of it
 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.940
here and so why don't we move some of it
do you want to move all of it we could

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
do you want to move all of it we could
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.859
do you want to move all of it we could
just do three consecutive moves moving

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869
just do three consecutive moves moving
 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.969
just do three consecutive moves moving
money over yeah yeah that's right it's

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
money over yeah yeah that's right it's
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.139
money over yeah yeah that's right it's
ok to be on there you just don't want

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
ok to be on there you just don't want
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.809
ok to be on there you just don't want
any debt so let's do three moves each

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819
any debt so let's do three moves each
 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.600
any debt so let's do three moves each
time we'll donate $1 from this vertex to

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610
time we'll donate $1 from this vertex to
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.760
time we'll donate $1 from this vertex to
it's only connected guy ok

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770
it's only connected guy ok
 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.940
it's only connected guy ok
great so now we have two problem

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
great so now we have two problem
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.410
great so now we have two problem
vertices left these two minus ones so

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420
vertices left these two minus ones so
 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.970
vertices left these two minus ones so
what should we try why don't we

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980
what should we try why don't we
 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.940
what should we try why don't we
consolidate oh let's try it so you want

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
consolidate oh let's try it so you want
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.290
consolidate oh let's try it so you want
to donate oh sorry you went the other

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300
to donate oh sorry you went the other
 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300
to donate oh sorry you went the other
way

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310
way
 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.710
way
well if this donates usually you have to

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720
well if this donates usually you have to
 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.660
well if this donates usually you have to
give two there oh you're donating the

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
give two there oh you're donating the
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.090
give two there oh you're donating the
other way oh sorry I see what you're

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100
other way oh sorry I see what you're
 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.940
other way oh sorry I see what you're
saying this no let's do what you said so

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950
saying this no let's do what you said so
 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.250
saying this no let's do what you said so
this thing donates to everyone so it

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260
this thing donates to everyone so it
 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.930
this thing donates to everyone so it
goes from being minus one to being minus

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940
goes from being minus one to being minus
 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.800
goes from being minus one to being minus
four right yeah okay

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810
four right yeah okay
 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.720
four right yeah okay
now this person can give to their good

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730
now this person can give to their good
 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.040
now this person can give to their good
good yeah let's get rid of his three

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050
good yeah let's get rid of his three
 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.610
good yeah let's get rid of his three
okay so five can give goes down to two

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620
okay so five can give goes down to two
 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.240
okay so five can give goes down to two
one two minus two and then I guess every

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250
one two minus two and then I guess every
 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.350
one two minus two and then I guess every
time we have something here we should

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
time we have something here we should
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.530
time we have something here we should
move it back right yeah I go zero and

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
move it back right yeah I go zero and
 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.220
move it back right yeah I go zero and
three and now to up here yeah do another

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
three and now to up here yeah do another
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.780
three and now to up here yeah do another
good good zero minus one for oh it looks

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790
good good zero minus one for oh it looks
 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.260
good good zero minus one for oh it looks
pretty good that's right okay so one one

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270
pretty good that's right okay so one one
 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.670
pretty good that's right okay so one one
and zero okay oh and I went up here okay

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680
and zero okay oh and I went up here okay
 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.670
and zero okay oh and I went up here okay
so we went right after much much

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680
so we went right after much much
 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.020
so we went right after much much
difficulty we've got zero and one zero

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030
difficulty we've got zero and one zero
 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.420
difficulty we've got zero and one zero
one and one is we have demonstrated very

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
one and one is we have demonstrated very
 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.250
one and one is we have demonstrated very
well here it's not obvious if we took

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260
well here it's not obvious if we took
 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.230
well here it's not obvious if we took
the optimal strategy to win this game

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240
the optimal strategy to win this game
 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.120
the optimal strategy to win this game
it's possible that we could have done

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130
it's possible that we could have done
 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.190
it's possible that we could have done
fewer moves and so one question you

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200
fewer moves and so one question you
 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.290
fewer moves and so one question you
could ask is if you hand me a game like

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300
could ask is if you hand me a game like
 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.970
could ask is if you hand me a game like
this if you draw the graph and you

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980
this if you draw the graph and you
 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.540
this if you draw the graph and you
assign the numbers how few moves can you

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550
assign the numbers how few moves can you
 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.880
assign the numbers how few moves can you
win the game in but before you even ask

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890
win the game in but before you even ask
 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.560
win the game in but before you even ask
that question you might wonder when is

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570
that question you might wonder when is
 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.020
that question you might wonder when is
it possible to win this game right like

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030
it possible to win this game right like
 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.340
it possible to win this game right like
if we had started with all negative

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350
if we had started with all negative
 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.620
if we had started with all negative
numbers then obviously it's impossible

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630
numbers then obviously it's impossible
 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.750
numbers then obviously it's impossible
because no matter what we try it's not

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760
because no matter what we try it's not
 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.690
because no matter what we try it's not
going to finish the problem or even you

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700
going to finish the problem or even you
 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.250
going to finish the problem or even you
can think about if we had started with

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260
can think about if we had started with
 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.770
can think about if we had started with
numbers that have the property that they

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
numbers that have the property that they
 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.170
numbers that have the property that they
don't add up to something non-negative

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180
don't add up to something non-negative
 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.420
don't add up to something non-negative
right like if the sum of all of the

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
right like if the sum of all of the
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.870
right like if the sum of all of the
numbers was negative there has to be

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880
numbers was negative there has to be
 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.190
numbers was negative there has to be
enough money on the board to get

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200
enough money on the board to get
 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.380
enough money on the board to get
everyone out of debt exactly so there

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390
everyone out of debt exactly so there
 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.120
everyone out of debt exactly so there
are obviously some constraints for when

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130
are obviously some constraints for when
 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.990
are obviously some constraints for when
you can win this game

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
you can win this game
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.930
you can win this game
so let's do a slightly simpler version

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940
so let's do a slightly simpler version
 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.630
so let's do a slightly simpler version
so let's say we just have two vertices

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640
so let's say we just have two vertices
 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.680
so let's say we just have two vertices
and we'll connect them by an edge now my

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690
and we'll connect them by an edge now my
 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.840
and we'll connect them by an edge now my
question is what kind of money can I put

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850
question is what kind of money can I put
 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.640
question is what kind of money can I put
into this game to make it possible to

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650
into this game to make it possible to
 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.430
into this game to make it possible to
win so for example if I have -2 here

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440
win so for example if I have -2 here
 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.530
win so for example if I have -2 here
let's say what numbers will work over

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540
let's say what numbers will work over
 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.870
let's say what numbers will work over
here to make it a winnable game and the

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880
here to make it a winnable game and the
 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.510
here to make it a winnable game and the
answer as well as long as I have 2 over

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520
answer as well as long as I have 2 over
 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.420
answer as well as long as I have 2 over
here then I can win so in this game so

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430
here then I can win so in this game so
 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.600
here then I can win so in this game so
the only thing we need to win is to have

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610
the only thing we need to win is to have
 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.400
the only thing we need to win is to have
enough money in other words we've got to

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410
enough money in other words we've got to
 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.910
enough money in other words we've got to
have a non-negative sum in the bank on

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920
have a non-negative sum in the bank on
 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.280
have a non-negative sum in the bank on
the board okay so let's do something

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290
the board okay so let's do something
 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.910
the board okay so let's do something
similar here now with 3 vertices and now

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:07.920
similar here now with 3 vertices and now
 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.210
similar here now with 3 vertices and now
it's not so obvious exactly if this is

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220
it's not so obvious exactly if this is
 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.340
it's not so obvious exactly if this is
still true right I mean so let's say I

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350
still true right I mean so let's say I
 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:15.200
still true right I mean so let's say I
have something negative over here and

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210
have something negative over here and
 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.960
have something negative over here and
maybe I don't know negative over here

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970
maybe I don't know negative over here
 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.760
maybe I don't know negative over here
again I want to have enough money on the

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770
again I want to have enough money on the
 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.020
again I want to have enough money on the
board so I've got to have at least 3

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030
board so I've got to have at least 3
 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.090
board so I've got to have at least 3
here let's say I have 4 or something

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100
here let's say I have 4 or something
 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.180
here let's say I have 4 or something
like that then what I can do is I can

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190
like that then what I can do is I can
 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.890
like that then what I can do is I can
donate all of the money from the

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900
donate all of the money from the
 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.909
donate all of the money from the
positive vertex to the other 2 vertices

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919
positive vertex to the other 2 vertices
 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:32.900
positive vertex to the other 2 vertices
but because of the way that they're

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910
but because of the way that they're
 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.400
but because of the way that they're
connected I can always balance it

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410
connected I can always balance it
 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:35.720
connected I can always balance it
between the two of them so that it works

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730
between the two of them so that it works
 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.060
between the two of them so that it works
and so the thing that was true for the

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070
and so the thing that was true for the
 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:40.460
and so the thing that was true for the
two vertex example is also true for this

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470
two vertex example is also true for this
 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.950
two vertex example is also true for this
3 vertex example but let's try a

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960
3 vertex example but let's try a
 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.010
3 vertex example but let's try a
different arrangement of three vertices

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020
different arrangement of three vertices
 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.950
different arrangement of three vertices
it turns out that it's possible in this

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960
it turns out that it's possible in this
 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.230
it turns out that it's possible in this
arrangement to have enough money on the

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240
arrangement to have enough money on the
 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.750
arrangement to have enough money on the
board but never win the game and I'm

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760
board but never win the game and I'm
 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.860
board but never win the game and I'm
going to show you a way that that can

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870
going to show you a way that that can
 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.460
going to show you a way that that can
happen so if I assign the number 0 here

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470
happen so if I assign the number 0 here
 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.680
happen so if I assign the number 0 here
1 here and minus 1 here then let's think

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690
1 here and minus 1 here then let's think
 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.510
1 here and minus 1 here then let's think
about what's going to happen so I have

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520
about what's going to happen so I have
 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.980
about what's going to happen so I have
enough money on the board right the sum

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990
enough money on the board right the sum
 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.040
enough money on the board right the sum
is 0 but if I donate from one of the

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:10.050
is 0 but if I donate from one of the
 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:12.590
is 0 but if I donate from one of the
positive vertices it will immediately

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600
positive vertices it will immediately
 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.900
positive vertices it will immediately
turn negative and that's true no matter

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:14.910
turn negative and that's true no matter
 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.760
turn negative and that's true no matter
how many times I try and do it and so I

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
how many times I try and do it and so I
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.980
how many times I try and do it and so I
can never get rid of the fact that we

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:18.990
can never get rid of the fact that we
 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.690
can never get rid of the fact that we
have some negative vertex in this graph

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700
have some negative vertex in this graph
 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.370
have some negative vertex in this graph
even though there's enough money on the

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380
even though there's enough money on the
 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.440
even though there's enough money on the
board because you always have to move

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:24.450
board because you always have to move
 

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.810
board because you always have to move
yeah that's right because there's too

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820
yeah that's right because there's too
 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.159
yeah that's right because there's too
much connection right what's the

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169
much connection right what's the
 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.290
much connection right what's the
difference between these two graphs it's

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300
difference between these two graphs it's
 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.480
difference between these two graphs it's
that I can't move sort of freely between

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490
that I can't move sort of freely between
 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.700
that I can't move sort of freely between
two chosen vertices I have to donate all

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710
two chosen vertices I have to donate all
 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.130
two chosen vertices I have to donate all
or nothing in the second case and so

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140
or nothing in the second case and so
 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.839
or nothing in the second case and so
it's not enough so this is a bad

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849
it's not enough so this is a bad
 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.050
it's not enough so this is a bad
configuration

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060
configuration
 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.240
configuration
at game not winnable it's not enough

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.250
at game not winnable it's not enough
 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.860
at game not winnable it's not enough
just to have enough money on the board

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:43.870
just to have enough money on the board
 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.950
just to have enough money on the board
for all possible graphs and so then okay

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960
for all possible graphs and so then okay
 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.740
for all possible graphs and so then okay
the question is can I tell and it turns

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750
the question is can I tell and it turns
 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.050
the question is can I tell and it turns
out to be really complicated actually to

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060
out to be really complicated actually to
 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.900
out to be really complicated actually to
answer this question so I definitely

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:54.910
answer this question so I definitely
 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.430
answer this question so I definitely
advise that you sort of mess around with

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440
advise that you sort of mess around with
 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.170
advise that you sort of mess around with
this a little bit you can draw any kind

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180
this a little bit you can draw any kind
 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.390
this a little bit you can draw any kind
of graph you want probably you want it

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400
of graph you want probably you want it
 

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:01.920
of graph you want probably you want it
to be connected because that makes the

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930
to be connected because that makes the
 

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.629
to be connected because that makes the
game a little bit more interesting and

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639
game a little bit more interesting and
 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.020
game a little bit more interesting and
assign some numbers respecting this idea

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:07.030
assign some numbers respecting this idea
 

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:07.950
assign some numbers respecting this idea
that okay you've got to have enough

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960
that okay you've got to have enough
 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.409
that okay you've got to have enough
money on the board right and see what

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419
money on the board right and see what
 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:14.550
money on the board right and see what
kind of things you end up with yeah you

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560
kind of things you end up with yeah you
 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.810
kind of things you end up with yeah you
really could I mean it depends on your

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:15.820
really could I mean it depends on your
 

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.629
really could I mean it depends on your
patience level but next time you're

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639
patience level but next time you're
 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:19.800
patience level but next time you're
bored in at an airport which is

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810
bored in at an airport which is
 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.750
bored in at an airport which is
something I am very often it that's

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:21.760
something I am very often it that's
 

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.980
something I am very often it that's
something that you can do is play this

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990
something that you can do is play this
 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.600
something that you can do is play this
game do you want to know the answer

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610
game do you want to know the answer
 

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.110
game do you want to know the answer
Brady yeah yeah okay so the full answer

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:28.120
Brady yeah yeah okay so the full answer
 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.760
Brady yeah yeah okay so the full answer
is actually really complicated but let

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:29.770
is actually really complicated but let
 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.830
is actually really complicated but let
me tell you a partial answer I can at

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:31.840
me tell you a partial answer I can at
 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:33.270
me tell you a partial answer I can at
least tell you that a game is definitely

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280
least tell you that a game is definitely
 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.510
least tell you that a game is definitely
winnable in certain cases so there's a

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:36.520
winnable in certain cases so there's a
 

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.460
winnable in certain cases so there's a
special number you can assign to a graph

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:38.470
special number you can assign to a graph
 

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.730
special number you can assign to a graph
call this genus so the genus of a graph

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:41.740
call this genus so the genus of a graph
 

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.969
call this genus so the genus of a graph
the number of edges of the graph minus

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:44.979
the number of edges of the graph minus
 

00:07:44.979 --> 00:07:47.580
the number of edges of the graph minus
the number of vertices of the graph plus

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:47.590
the number of vertices of the graph plus
 

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:50.670
the number of vertices of the graph plus
one okay very simple to count so let's

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:50.680
one okay very simple to count so let's
 

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.320
one okay very simple to count so let's
check what the genus is in each of these

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:52.330
check what the genus is in each of these
 

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:55.620
check what the genus is in each of these
cases so in this case the genus is let's

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:55.630
cases so in this case the genus is let's
 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.380
cases so in this case the genus is let's
see we've got one edge and we've got two

00:07:58.380 --> 00:07:58.390
see we've got one edge and we've got two
 

00:07:58.390 --> 00:08:01.350
see we've got one edge and we've got two
vertices and we add 1 so the genus is

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:01.360
vertices and we add 1 so the genus is
 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.380
vertices and we add 1 so the genus is
zero in this case we've got two edges

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:04.390
zero in this case we've got two edges
 

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:07.830
zero in this case we've got two edges
three vertices and we add one and again

00:08:07.830 --> 00:08:07.840
three vertices and we add one and again
 

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.190
three vertices and we add one and again
we get zero in this case we've got three

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.200
we get zero in this case we've got three
 

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.120
we get zero in this case we've got three
edges three vertices plus 1 so the genus

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:15.130
edges three vertices plus 1 so the genus
 

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:17.760
edges three vertices plus 1 so the genus
is one and so this is giving me a way to

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:17.770
is one and so this is giving me a way to
 

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.790
is one and so this is giving me a way to
detect this notion that I mentioned

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800
detect this notion that I mentioned
 

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.560
detect this notion that I mentioned
earlier it being it's a little too

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.570
earlier it being it's a little too
 

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.110
earlier it being it's a little too
connected right it's too complicated to

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120
connected right it's too complicated to
 

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.180
connected right it's too complicated to
try and move money around the graph and

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:27.190
try and move money around the graph and
 

00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:29.250
try and move money around the graph and
this number which is the genus gives you

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:29.260
this number which is the genus gives you
 

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.050
this number which is the genus gives you
an idea of how much complication there

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.060
an idea of how much complication there
 

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.060
an idea of how much complication there
is and so it turns out that you can show

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.070
is and so it turns out that you can show
 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.510
is and so it turns out that you can show
that a graph must be winnable there is

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.520
that a graph must be winnable there is
 

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.100
that a graph must be winnable there is
some way to win this game

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:38.110
some way to win this game
 

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:40.980
some way to win this game
if the amount of money you have is at

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:40.990
if the amount of money you have is at
 

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.640
if the amount of money you have is at
least as large as the genus of the graph

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:43.650
least as large as the genus of the graph
 

00:08:43.650 --> 00:08:46.230
least as large as the genus of the graph
that's your surplus that's your surplus

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240
that's your surplus that's your surplus
 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:49.260
that's your surplus that's your surplus
so here we knew that the game was

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:49.270
so here we knew that the game was
 

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:51.720
so here we knew that the game was
winnable exactly when we have zero or

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:51.730
winnable exactly when we have zero or
 

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:53.670
winnable exactly when we have zero or
more dollars on the board

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680
more dollars on the board
 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:55.619
more dollars on the board
we know the game is winnable by what I

00:08:55.619 --> 00:08:55.629
we know the game is winnable by what I
 

00:08:55.629 --> 00:08:57.720
we know the game is winnable by what I
just said if the number of dollars on

00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:57.730
just said if the number of dollars on
 

00:08:57.730 --> 00:08:59.340
just said if the number of dollars on
the board is larger than the genus which

00:08:59.340 --> 00:08:59.350
the board is larger than the genus which
 

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.069
the board is larger than the genus which
is zero and same here right because the

00:09:02.069 --> 00:09:02.079
is zero and same here right because the
 

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:04.319
is zero and same here right because the
graph has genus 0 as long as there's at

00:09:04.319 --> 00:09:04.329
graph has genus 0 as long as there's at
 

00:09:04.329 --> 00:09:06.299
graph has genus 0 as long as there's at
least a zero dollars on the board we can

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:06.309
least a zero dollars on the board we can
 

00:09:06.309 --> 00:09:10.410
least a zero dollars on the board we can
win the game yeah that's right but I

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:10.420
win the game yeah that's right but I
 

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.669
win the game yeah that's right but I
could have had a three here and it would

00:09:11.669 --> 00:09:11.679
could have had a three here and it would
 

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:14.160
could have had a three here and it would
have worked out right and then here in

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.170
have worked out right and then here in
 

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:17.160
have worked out right and then here in
this bad game example it didn't work to

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.170
this bad game example it didn't work to
 

00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:19.290
this bad game example it didn't work to
just have zero dollars on the board but

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:19.300
just have zero dollars on the board but
 

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:21.480
just have zero dollars on the board but
here's the reason why which is that the

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:21.490
here's the reason why which is that the
 

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:23.699
here's the reason why which is that the
genus is one and so in order to win the

00:09:23.699 --> 00:09:23.709
genus is one and so in order to win the
 

00:09:23.709 --> 00:09:25.290
genus is one and so in order to win the
game you've got to have at least one

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:25.300
game you've got to have at least one
 

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:26.549
game you've got to have at least one
dollar on the board

00:09:26.549 --> 00:09:26.559
dollar on the board
 

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:28.379
dollar on the board
now the thing that's kind of funny is

00:09:28.379 --> 00:09:28.389
now the thing that's kind of funny is
 

00:09:28.389 --> 00:09:30.689
now the thing that's kind of funny is
that it's actually not an absolute

00:09:30.689 --> 00:09:30.699
that it's actually not an absolute
 

00:09:30.699 --> 00:09:32.220
that it's actually not an absolute
characterization of when you can win the

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:32.230
characterization of when you can win the
 

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:34.319
characterization of when you can win the
game sometimes you might have less money

00:09:34.319 --> 00:09:34.329
game sometimes you might have less money
 

00:09:34.329 --> 00:09:35.850
game sometimes you might have less money
than you think you need but you can

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:35.860
than you think you need but you can
 

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.759
than you think you need but you can
still win the game and actually trying

00:09:38.759 --> 00:09:38.769
still win the game and actually trying
 

00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:41.059
still win the game and actually trying
to figure out exactly some nice

00:09:41.059 --> 00:09:41.069
to figure out exactly some nice
 

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:42.749
to figure out exactly some nice
characterization of when you can win the

00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:42.759
characterization of when you can win the
 

00:09:42.759 --> 00:09:45.389
characterization of when you can win the
game is pretty complicated but even to

00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399
game is pretty complicated but even to
 

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:47.160
game is pretty complicated but even to
show even to prove that this is true

00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.170
show even to prove that this is true
 

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:49.019
show even to prove that this is true
that if you have as much money as the

00:09:49.019 --> 00:09:49.029
that if you have as much money as the
 

00:09:49.029 --> 00:09:51.359
that if you have as much money as the
genus of the graph you can win requires

00:09:51.359 --> 00:09:51.369
genus of the graph you can win requires
 

00:09:51.369 --> 00:09:53.819
genus of the graph you can win requires
some really advanced graph theory and so

00:09:53.819 --> 00:09:53.829
some really advanced graph theory and so
 

00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:55.169
some really advanced graph theory and so
I would be really interested to see I

00:09:55.169 --> 00:09:55.179
I would be really interested to see I
 

00:09:55.179 --> 00:09:56.100
I would be really interested to see I
don't think I've given you homework

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.110
don't think I've given you homework
 

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.829
don't think I've given you homework
before I would be really interested to

00:09:58.829 --> 00:09:58.839
before I would be really interested to
 

00:09:58.839 --> 00:10:01.439
before I would be really interested to
see a much more straightforward argument

00:10:01.439 --> 00:10:01.449
see a much more straightforward argument
 

00:10:01.449 --> 00:10:03.600
see a much more straightforward argument
that this is true that that having this

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:03.610
that this is true that that having this
 

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.970
that this is true that that having this
much money guarantees you a winning set

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:05.980
much money guarantees you a winning set
 

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.619
much money guarantees you a winning set
of moves to win the game what was the

00:10:07.619 --> 00:10:07.629
of moves to win the game what was the
 

00:10:07.629 --> 00:10:09.239
of moves to win the game what was the
genius of our first game and how much

00:10:09.239 --> 00:10:09.249
genius of our first game and how much
 

00:10:09.249 --> 00:10:10.739
genius of our first game and how much
money was on the oh that's a good

00:10:10.739 --> 00:10:10.749
money was on the oh that's a good
 

00:10:10.749 --> 00:10:12.809
money was on the oh that's a good
question let's figure it out so let's

00:10:12.809 --> 00:10:12.819
question let's figure it out so let's
 

00:10:12.819 --> 00:10:14.610
question let's figure it out so let's
see we've got one two three four five

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:14.620
see we've got one two three four five
 

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.319
see we've got one two three four five
edges we've got five vertices and we add

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:19.329
edges we've got five vertices and we add
 

00:10:19.329 --> 00:10:21.689
edges we've got five vertices and we add
1 so the genus and this was one also and

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:21.699
1 so the genus and this was one also and
 

00:10:21.699 --> 00:10:24.239
1 so the genus and this was one also and
what did we start with we started with

00:10:24.239 --> 00:10:24.249
what did we start with we started with
 

00:10:24.249 --> 00:10:26.879
what did we start with we started with
six minus three we started with three

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:26.889
six minus three we started with three
 

00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:29.249
six minus three we started with three
dollars on the board so we really sort

00:10:29.249 --> 00:10:29.259
dollars on the board so we really sort
 

00:10:29.259 --> 00:10:30.569
dollars on the board so we really sort
of rigged the game for ourselves we

00:10:30.569 --> 00:10:30.579
of rigged the game for ourselves we
 

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:31.410
of rigged the game for ourselves we
should have been able to do better

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:31.420
should have been able to do better
 

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.290
should have been able to do better
probably say you could have taken two

00:10:34.290 --> 00:10:34.300
probably say you could have taken two
 

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.419
probably say you could have taken two
dollars off the board and we still would

00:10:36.419 --> 00:10:36.429
dollars off the board and we still would
 

00:10:36.429 --> 00:10:37.949
dollars off the board and we still would
have been able to still with it which is

00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959
have been able to still with it which is
 

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.360
have been able to still with it which is
weird if you go back and look at this it

it I think that is the most interesting
 

00:10:51.429 --> 00:10:53.460
it I think that is the most interesting
thing is that winnable but I also think

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:53.470
thing is that winnable but I also think
 

00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:55.139
thing is that winnable but I also think
it's incredibly interesting on what the

00:10:55.139 --> 00:10:55.149
it's incredibly interesting on what the
 

00:10:55.149 --> 00:10:57.780
it's incredibly interesting on what the
minimal number of moves is yeah so even

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:57.790
minimal number of moves is yeah so even
 

00:10:57.790 --> 00:10:59.639
minimal number of moves is yeah so even
i mentioned that is it winnable is

00:10:59.639 --> 00:10:59.649
i mentioned that is it winnable is
 

00:10:59.649 --> 00:11:01.470
i mentioned that is it winnable is
complicated to prove I don't think that

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:01.480
complicated to prove I don't think that
 

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.419
