&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.310
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Welcome, I'm Michelle Stefano,

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:28.320
I'm a folklife specialist at the
American Folklife Center here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.120
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.610
We're in the Coolidge Auditorium
in the Jefferson Building

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.080
of the Library of Congress.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.180
And just a little while ago
we were treated to a series

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.560
of dance battles organized
by Urban Artistry,

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.630
a nonprofit organization
based in Silver Spring.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.430
And I'm fortunate to be joined

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.780
by its founding executive
director Junious Brickhouse.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.940
And would you mind introducing
who else we have here on stage?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.760
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse:
Yes, absolutely.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.300
This is Ryan "Future" Webb and
Baronhawk Poitier Williams,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.670
and Rashaad Hasani Pearson.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.860
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
so, correct me if I'm wrong,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.520
but what brings you all together is
Urban Artistry, this organization.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.100
So Junious, just so people
have a better understanding,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.890 position:56%
what exactly does Urban Artistry do?

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.800
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Urban
Artistry is a nonprofit dedicated

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.860
to the preservation
of urban dance culture

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.300
in its simple form
and more complex idea.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.900
We're trying our best to be
ambassadors of our cultures,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.090
of our communities, and do our best

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.240
to preserve what we're doing now
what's been done before we came

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.500
along so in short, yeah.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.290
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And how would
you describe what urban dance is?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.300
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: So that's
a question that we get a lot

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.870 position:56%
and the answer is always changing,
you know, as this is living culture.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.440
Ideally, when we first started,
saying urban dance was something

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.730
that we wanted to say to get out of
saying street dance all the time.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.180
Especially since there was a
connotation to that, you know.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.720
And you know, I knew a
lot of talented people

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.690
who were definitely
ambassadors of the culture

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.780 position:56%
that weren't from the street at all.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.800 position:56%
So kind of thought it was polarizing
and I thought that it kind of put us

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.340
under a different light, you know,
something that wasn't really us.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.230
So saying urban dance culture
allowed us to be authentic

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.740
to wherever we came from and the
cultures that we wanted to express.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.690
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And you
founded Urban Artistry in 2005.

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.160
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Yes, in
2005 that was where the work began.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:02.150
It was a contemplated effort on
how we could see all the people

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.500
in our community that
weren't dancing professionally

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.800
that were dancing in the clubs

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.220
that may not have been
profession dancers or world famous.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.780
How can we get them involved,
not just in this industry

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.300
but to hear their stories and
find out about where they're from

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.030
and the things that they were
doing and what made them tick.

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.470
And to see how broad our culture
and our communities actually were.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.690
So it was an effort to
not just dance together

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.920
but to start the documentation
process of who are we

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.280 position:56%
in all these different
communities and telling our stories.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.250
So when we started it
was about eight of us

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.760
and Ryan wasn't with us just yet.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:02.270
We knew who Ryan was but he was
away at school during that time.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:10.080
But definitely Baronhawk
and Rashaad were there.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.870
And it sounds kind of funny
now but like back then

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.010
in my head it was simple,
it was like, you know,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.330
a lot of these people
were really talented

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.340
but they don't have all the tools.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.740
I have some tools, I
don't have all of them.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.260
But if I could share those
tools and I could kind of open

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.010
up what I'm doing so they
can see what I'm doing,

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.620
maybe together we can move
forward and I could do

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.490
for them what people had
done for me in the past

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.000
and basically giving me
the opportunity to be more

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.080
than just a club kid or somebody
hanging out at competitions.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.740
You know, just broaden it out.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.860
I saw a mistake, to me
it seemed like a mistake,

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.880 position:56%
it seemed like everyone was having
fun, but people weren't very serious

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.960 position:56%
about what it is that they're doing.

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.980
Dance was about fun to them,
and it was about being cool.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.680 position:56%
And I grew up dancing culturally, it
was my culture, it was my identity.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.030
The way we dressed, the way
we talk, the movement we did,

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.560
the music we listened to.

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.660
And even if it was different
types of music, you know,

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.680
all those things I felt like
was me, was my identity.

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:36.190
So those tools and these ways
of thinking, I just put it out

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:38.660
and shared it with
these young people.

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:46.410
And the snag was, okay,
once you share the idea

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.190
or you provide some opportunities,

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.660
like how do you get
them to reciprocate?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.370
So the idea was hey, okay,
if we start this project,

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.750
what you have to do
is you have to do

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.250
for others what I'm
doing for you right now.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.160 position:56%
And that's going to change but if we
stay in service to each other, like,

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.370
we can enrich our communities.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.170
And that was the beginning.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.470
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Well I'd

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.770
like to get a little
personal with each of you.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.070
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Uh-oh.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.370
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So 2005
you started Urban Artistry,

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:25.740
but take me back to your beginning
with respect to learning about

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:30.170
and immersing yourself and becoming
brought into urban dance culture.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.160
Where you're from, what
were the early days like?

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.990
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: So for
me the early days were simple.

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.700
I started dancing with my
family at home, you know,

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.140
like a lot of us did I think.

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:49.780
Dance was a way for me to
connect with my mom, you know.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.460
And to be able to have a voice.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.940
Like it made her smile,
it made her happy,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.560
so I remember just
connecting to that.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:05.390
And being around people
who danced, you know,

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:07.340
it was just kind of what we did.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.860
I don't think that I really--

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.990 position:56%
I would say like all through until I
graduated from high school like all

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:22.320
of the-- on a daily basis we were
dancing in our hallways or dancing

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.920
in the court of where we lived.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.070
Like go to recreation
centers, basketball courts,

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:31.990
wherever people were playing
music, and talent shows

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.270
and competitions for kids.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:36.900
We would frequent those
things all the time.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.160
I don't think it was until I
moved outside of my community

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.500
that I realized that
not everybody dances.

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.630
So I think when I moved
away from Virginia

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:54.500 position:56%
and joined the military I realized
that a lot of people couldn't dance.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:59.000
And a lot of people weren't really
serious about it, like people were

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.490
like dancing was funny to them.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.730
So people would dance around
and they'd make fun of things

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.820
and I'd be like-- that's not funny.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.520
And like, why are you making fun?

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:15.400
You know, so like it felt wrong to
me because I connected with that.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.400
When you connect with something
and it becomes a part of you

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.820
and you see someone mistreat it

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.800
or not give it the respect
due, you have a response.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.720
So that's what dance was
like for me as a kid.

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.750
And becoming an adult and
having a certain affection

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.270
for those good old
days where, you know.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:43.060
And as a soldier I could no longer
have the same childlike mind,

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:47.580
so to speak, and I couldn't express
myself through dance in that way,

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.900
at least not culturally,
I felt like.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:54.560
I was a soldier, I
wasn't a dancer anymore.

00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:00.000
So but even though I was still
dancing, dance even became,

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.760 position:56%
in the military environment, it
became even more so important to me.

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:12.170
Hence starting to do this kind
of work towards preservation

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:15.610
and documentation about dance.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.750
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And
we'll get to that in a moment.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:19.050
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Okay.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.350
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So you
grew up in Virginia Beach

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:22.270
in Norfolk, Virginia area.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.560
Set the scene a little bit
more, paint the picture.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:29.380
What was the music that
your mom was playing?

00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:34.050
What were maybe the first dances
or styles that you learned?

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:35.350
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Yeah.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:41.450 position:56%
Yeah so the music, definitely,
music of-- I was born in 74 so like,

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.140
you know, the music my mom
was listening to like--

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.740 position:56%
it changed throughout like the week.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:54.190
You know like the weekdays
was cleaning music,

00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:59.170
so that was like the R and B
stuff like that was mostly stuff

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:15.100
like Minnie Riperton, Blue Magic,
Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:17.210
And the weekends would
bring, as we got closer

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:19.300
to Friday the music got faster.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:24.390
We got, it was a lot more funk,
a lot more disco, you know.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:30.330
And yeah, so that was the music
that I grew up on as a child.

00:10:30.330 --> 00:10:36.300 position:56%
I think that maybe by the time I was
eight or nine years old I started

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.760
to find my own identity with music.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:43.390
And the rap thing started
to get really popular

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.680
and we didn't like a lot of that.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.120
The stuff that you
could dance to we liked.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:55.080 position:56%
It was rap then, it's hip-hop now,
but at first a lot of us kids didn't

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.290
like it because it
wasn't really dance music,

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:00.680
or at least dance that
we identified with.

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.500
So the music that some
of the first dances

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:10.530
that I did was the funky
robot, the breakdown,

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:13.470
all that stuff from Rufus Thomas.

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:17.150
And my mom liked Stax,
so, like that was a lot

00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:19.120
of stuff that she played as well.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.340
And they actually had names of
dances like the funky chicken

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.920
and you know, all that stuff.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.780
So by the time 77 and 78 rolled
around, you know, I was old enough

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.760
to comprehend that stuff
that had years before.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.310
And yeah so when I started
to get my own identity

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:44.380 position:56%
in dance I started doing like talent
shows and rec center competitions,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.990
and then just regular like
call-out battles that we used to do

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.650
in our neighborhoods or at other
projects with other dancers.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:58.410
And it really wasn't a big
deal then, but it was free.

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:01.910
And like a lot of us
couldn't afford to be

00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:04.700
on football teams or
basketball teams.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.820
So we had groups of people
who danced and hung out.

00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:12.340
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: A while
back you were also mentioning

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:18.840
to me how there was this kind
of a separation between proper,

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.750
"official" in quote, dance schools.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.510 position:56%
And then the school that occurred on
the streets and in the neighborhoods

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.630
in terms of learning from
mentors, joining or being brought

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:33.150
in to dance crews, that's an
alternative school that was

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:37.730
so often the school for
poor African American kids.

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:43.320
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Yeah, and I
think that was definitely the case

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.360
for me, it's different
for some other people.

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:52.220
But for me in Norfolk there
weren't a lot of places

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.920
where a little black boy like
myself could go and fit in,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.710
even if we could afford it.

00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:02.510
There wasn't like very
welcoming environment.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.810
So for us the best dancers
were people that we knew,

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:13.230
and people that we would see on
TV, on the old UHF channels like,

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:16.720
I was always a Bill Robinson fan.

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:21.420
I always admired that he
was teaching Shirley Temple.

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:27.250
I was like oh, that's an older
man teaching a little person,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:28.550
he's helping her with dance.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:31.500
And that seemed like something that
I was like oh that was really nice.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.690
You know, and it was just like my
mom, my mom helps me with dance.

00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:40.980 position:56%
And I would always imagine like what
would happen if I could be a start

00:13:40.980 --> 00:13:43.440
and I'd be on TV too like this.

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:45.750
And I was like no,
that's not really a thing.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:49.610
We really didn't think
that something

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.490
like this would be possible.

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:53.540
Not because we weren't
great dancers,

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.060
but because our scope wasn't there.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:59.050
We didn't have people around
us that told us hey yeah,

00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:01.650
you're going to be
famous one day dancing.

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:05.810
I don't think anyone ever
said that like as a kid.

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.060
I'm not saying I need to hear
it, though, but it just says

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.360
that there's a difference.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.300
Like pre-professional programming
and dance education is set

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:17.930
up in different communities
in different ways.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:24.770
And I don't think-- I'm glad
that my path was that way.

00:14:24.770 --> 00:14:32.420 position:56%
It taught me to respect my community
where my community is the people

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.900
that helped me as well as this idea

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:42.390
that dance is not recreational,
it's cultural.

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:51.110
And it's deeper, it's not something
you use to only advance yourself.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:53.280
You can use it to elevate people

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:57.790
and advance other people's
quality of life.

00:14:57.790 --> 00:15:01.800
It's something that can
be learned with patience

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.470 position:56%
and through sitting down, and it
doesn't rest in a building somewhere

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:11.240
like you go to dance school and
you leave and then you're informed.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:14.920
No, you can get the
information anywhere with someone

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.930
who wants to share it with you.

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.090
So that's-- yeah.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:23.090
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
That's great, thank you.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:27.480
How about Rashaad, what's your
story, what brought you into urban,

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:30.950
the rich and varied
urban dance traditions?

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:32.570
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson: That's
a really good question.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:36.460
I think for me my story
starts in New York City.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:40.150
Born and raised there
in Queens and in Harlem.

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.590
So specifically I just
remember being a little boy

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:50.970
in colonial projects like
trying to imitate my sister.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:57.710 position:56%
She had a group called The
Ruthless Violators and every summer,

00:15:57.710 --> 00:16:00.440
she's going to kill me
for saying this on camera,

00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.130
but every summer we would have
like family day and so in the back

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.790
which was the park with the
courts and stuff, there would be

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:12.160
like a talent show and her and her
group would get up there and dance.

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.860
It was primarily like hip-hop
music and a lot of Rob Base,

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:18.990
a lot of Kwame, Queen
Latifah, things like this.

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:23.070
And so they were doing the
hip-hop like social steps

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.780
of the time but in choreography.

00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.450
And then in between that there was
basketball games and there was food

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.840
and most of us young kids were
like playing on the monkey bars

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:35.350
or climbing under the
bleachers, you know.

00:16:35.350 --> 00:16:37.930
But the music was there
and the people were there

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.920
and everything was just so vibrant.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:44.410
In addition to that, I think
very similar to Junious is

00:16:44.410 --> 00:16:48.670
that my parents played a lot
of music around the house.

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.840
And Sundays were the days
that I remember the most

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.850
because I knew it was a good day
if I woke up and I smelled pancakes

00:16:57.850 --> 00:17:01.020
and my dad was playing The
Dells or like The Delfonics

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:03.940
and you just heard these,
what do they call it,

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.420
like the oldies, the classic music.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.790
And like he wouldn't wake me up
to clean something, you know.

00:17:10.790 --> 00:17:16.740
And every day whatever the music
was it just depended on their mood

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:20.800
and like I just remember
singing and dancing,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:23.370
trying to do what they were doing.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:31.420
I don't think I got fully aware of
what I was doing until I moved away

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:33.840
from the city and I moved down here

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.320
which was I think I
was 19, it was 2003.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:43.320
And I started trying to
find a community of people

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:46.360
to attach myself to, you know.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.700
19, I didn't really have a plan, I
didn't know where I was going next.

00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.660
I was just kind of
walking aimlessly.

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.040
And I found there was,
actually where Baron and me met,

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.880
but it was called the
DC Baltimore Pop Shop.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.380
And there were two groups that ran
it, it was Liquid Pop Collective

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.830
and it was the Boogie Nights.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:11.100
Yeah, these guys like showed
us fundamentals in the styles

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.770
of like boogalooing and
popping and locking.

00:18:13.770 --> 00:18:19.240
And I was just like in awe, like
just a fan of it, but because I was

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:26.000
so excited for it, I really tried
to practice as hard as I could

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.580
to get it so I could
fit in to these guys

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.080
that were teaching me these things.

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:40.770 position:56%
But 2005 I think my life took a turn
in terms of really being fully aware

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.160
of where I was going
and what I wanted to do.

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:49.240
And it was when I met Junious, we
actually met not too far from here

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:54.540
at a night club through a
gentleman from the Boogie Nights.

00:18:54.540 --> 00:19:00.950
And from there it was like
being a part of Urban Artistry

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:04.110
and being part of our
crew, like we--

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:10.880
man, my education just was
so rapid, like I grew so fast

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.340
because I was finally getting tools

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:18.650
that helped me represent what I
was learning when I was a kid.

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:23.460
Helped me to figure out what I
was trying to do that day and in

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:26.830
where I wanted to go 10,
20, 30 years from now.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:34.840
And I think like that was probably
the biggest part of my growth

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.680
as an artist and as a dancer.

00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:41.910
So that's kind of like the
short version to my story.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:43.250
But yeah.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.360
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
Baronhawk, how about you?

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.190
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: So I was born
in 87, I'm going to date myself.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:51.490
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Baby.

00:19:51.490 --> 00:19:54.650
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier:
Baby, yeah that's cool.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:20:01.060
And so but I'm the youngest of
seven, second youngest of eight.

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:07.040
And so my older siblings were
all dancers in their own way.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.000
So I picked up a lot of
early hip-hop social dances.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.520
I remember my sister and my
cousin taught me the Roger Rabbit

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:17.730
and the running man
on our back patio,

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.290
and I will never forget that day.

00:20:20.290 --> 00:20:25.940
But that's kind of where my-- just
picking up steps, and my mom loved

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:28.770
to dance, my mom loved to sing,
and she never had a chance

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:34.600 position:56%
to pursue her own artistic goals and
careers but she always allowed all

00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.680
of her children to do that
and she always pushed us,

00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.240
if we liked anything, if we
showed even just 10% of interest

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:46.710
in anything she'd go and
buy something to go push it

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:49.050
and ask us to do something with it.

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:52.200
So we have, you know, VHS
tapes of my older siblings

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.620
on stage doing dances and you
know being in performances.

00:20:55.620 --> 00:21:00.730
Some of my sisters are artists,
visual artists, and whatever else.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.530
So for me I was always
surrounded by that.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:07.960
And my father, he loved collecting
music, that was his thing,

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.480
all types of music; world music,
country, I always made fun of him

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.540
because he was the only person
in the house that loved country

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.140
and he played it all the time.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:21.870
But so I was exposed to a lot of
different things from a young age.

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:27.210
And it was natural, it was
never looked at as weird,

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.520
like oh you're listening
to weird music or--

00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:33.490 position:56%
everything was acceptable, you know?

00:21:33.490 --> 00:21:35.690
It was cool.

00:21:35.690 --> 00:21:42.150
So when I started really picking
up dances and I started breaking

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.090
in 2001 when I was a
freshman in high school.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.210
Me and my friends just
decided to take over a couple

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:52.140
of hallways every two or
three days out of the week,

00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:55.070 position:56%
after school, and we just practiced.

00:21:55.070 --> 00:22:00.750
We didn't really, sports weren't
really a big thing for our group,

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.410
video games were but we
realized that dance was something

00:22:04.410 --> 00:22:07.290
that we really connected with
and we really enjoyed doing it

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:12.060
and we practiced it so much so
that now I'm here in the Library

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.520
of Congress practicing
the same dance moves.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:23.120
But it was in 2005 when I graduated
that I met Junious as well.

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:28.620
And we actually met via a
battle, actually, I'd called him

00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.530
out just as a friendly exchange.

00:22:31.530 --> 00:22:35.920
And he smoked me but
it was intriguing

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.370
because I was practicing a
dance style that wasn't popular

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:42.150
in this area and that
dance style was locking.

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:44.990
And there wasn't really anybody
else practicing that dance style.

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:46.490
So when I saw somebody
else doing it,

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:51.470
and he was black, I
was like oh, what!

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:53.710
This is amazing!

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:55.010
It blew my mind.

00:22:55.010 --> 00:23:00.790
And so we developed a kinship
very quickly from that moment,

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.750
and now we're working on
a professional company.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:05.050
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Yeah,

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:06.350
you're the artistic
director of Urban Artistry.

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.650
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: I'm one
of the artistic directors.

00:23:07.650 --> 00:23:11.980
I'm also DJ-ing for the group,
one of the DJ's for the group.

00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.370
I've picked up producing
music as well.

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.540
A lot has happened.

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.980
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: You mentioned
two really important words:

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.680
battling, and also locking.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:23.350
Would you mind describing
what they are?

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:24.650
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: Sure.

00:23:24.650 --> 00:23:25.950
I'll start with locking.

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:29.700
Locking is a dance style from
California, from the west coast.

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:32.740
It started in the late
60's, in the early 70's.

00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.740
It's actually the second dance
style in the battle, if you go back

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.310
in the archive and
re-watch the battle.

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:44.550
It's a very expressive
dance, to say the least.

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:50.650
It's a very explosive dance,
it's one of the upright styles

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:51.950
where you're kind of on your feet.

00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:53.760
You can take it down to the floor

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.990
but it's mostly an
upright dance style.

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.290
And because you're asked

00:23:58.290 --> 00:24:01.370
to be upright it's kind
of awkward for people.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.540
And the motions behind it, there's
a lot of arm movement associated

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.880
with it, and it's different
from popping

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:12.510 position:56%
where popping is more illusion-based

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:16.100
where you're making people
believe that you're a robot.

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.770
You're making them believe that
there's something traveling

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:21.520
through your body and
you're making your body look

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.720
like it's actual liquid.

00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.020
Locking is not.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:27.210
There's nothing illusion-based
around it.

00:24:27.210 --> 00:24:31.640
It's just a very fun party dance.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:37.440
Battling is the competition
aspect of dance.

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.140
So this is you and I or my group

00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.870
and your group exchanging
rounds back and forth.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:51.140 position:56%
If it's in an organized battle, it's
for a time limit, if it's in a club,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:54.430
it's whoever gives up
first, or whoever concedes,

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.420
it's whoever's mature
enough to concede

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:59.040
that they have lost this battle.

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:03.410 position:56%
But you're exchanging dance moved to
see who has a better understanding

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:06.520
of the dance, who has the
most vocabulary of the dance,

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:11.740
who has been practicing it the
most, who is able to take the dance

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.190
and show you the fundamentals
but then also be able

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.410 position:56%
to flip the fundamentals and show
you hey this is what the dance could

00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:20.160
be and this is the advanced
portion of the dance.

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:24.900
And that's what battling should
be, that's what battling should be.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.280
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I know today
was an organized battle, right?

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:28.580
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: Yeah.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:29.880
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
There was set time,

00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.180
even though we went over,
which was fine, right?

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.480
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: Yeah.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.780
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
But I'm really intrigued

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.530
about being called out in clubs.

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.280
How often does that happen
to you or any funny stories?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.030
Did you ever kill-- excuse me--

00:25:44.030 --> 00:25:46.050
[ Laughter ]

00:25:46.050 --> 00:25:48.420
I mean smoke, did you
ever smoke someone--

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.720
&gt;&gt; Ryan Webb: He never
killed anyone!

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.040
[ Laughter ]

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.340
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: I
meant that figuratively.

00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.040
[ Laughter ]

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.070
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.490
&gt;&gt; Ryan Webb: Sure,
I'll answer that one.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:25:59.790
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
And then you can talk

00:25:59.790 --> 00:26:02.340
about your story, you
getting into dance.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:06.540
&gt;&gt; Ryan Webb: Yeah, I've been
in plenty of call-out battles.

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.830
I started as a B-boy and
a popper and at that time,

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:14.160
which was early 2000's,
it was sort of the era

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.580
of organized contests coming in.

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.550
But the tradition of like call-outs
and hey I want to test my skills

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:23.850
against you and see where I'm
at and see where you're at,

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:27.550 position:56%
or hey I want to check your ego,
maybe you've been saying some things

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.930
or maybe like you need to put
some action behind those words

00:26:30.930 --> 00:26:32.230
and let's see what you got.

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:35.400
Like that sort of like healthy
competition was still around.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.610
So I've done plenty, I'll
give you a little scenario

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.910
of when that happened recently.

00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:48.260
So there's was someone
that was saying hey,

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:52.210
I don't know if you
should be teaching kids,

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.940
maybe you're not qualified,

00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.850
maybe your groups not
qualified to teach kids.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:00.600
And I was like, that's
ridiculous, like, I know my people,

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.910
we can teach, we know our
stuff, we know our history,

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.030
we've learned the culture, we know
the foundation, multiple styles,

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.690
like why wouldn't we
be able to teach kids?

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:13.760
So I said okay well if this guy
thinks that he's more qualified

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.300
or he wants to say something
like that about my organization,

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.070
I'm going to test his skills
and see where he's at, right?

00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:22.950
Let the actions speak
louder than the words.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:26.160
So I actually have
views via internet,

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:28.040
so this is something new
that's happening, right.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.030
Before it would be like you,
me, now, when you see them,

00:27:31.030 --> 00:27:32.330
and that can happen anywhere.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.880
In the street, in the club, at
an organized event, whatever,

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:38.070
but this one was kind of like
hey, I'm calling this guy out,

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.220
I wanted to prove a point and
I wanted people to know hey,

00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:43.110
this is what's happening.

00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:47.540
My solution to solve this
conflict is to exchange in movement

00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.030
and then talk about it afterwards.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:54.670
So we met at a club, we went
18 rounds each, no time limit,

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:58.370
no picking of the music, just
whatever the DJ was playing.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:01.070
And shook hands at the
end and that was that.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:02.370
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Who won?

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.670
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: I did.

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.970
I did.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.030
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
That's a good story to tell.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.330
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: Yeah.

00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.630
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So
if I may, what brought you

00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:11.740
into urban dance culture?

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:13.670
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: So, okay,

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:17.800
my mother originally was my first
dance teacher, not urban dance,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.090
she's a ballerina and she
does some Broadway Jazz.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.300
So when I was little she used
to have me performing at church.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.750
We would do a little
gymnastics, a little formations,

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:30.890
a little like jazz runs and
things, simple things like that.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.330
I eventually said hey mom
this is just not cool,

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:35.470
I'm going to play sports
and this is just not going

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.770
to be my thing anymore.

00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:41.040
She was upset about that, but what
she did was when I was about 14,

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.500
15 she tricked me by showing me
Michael Jackson videos, right,

00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:48.760
and just showing me that
kind of got me back into it.

00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:52.160 position:56%
And she didn't say oh do this, it
was just like oh look at this video.

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.480
So right, that was the smart
way to get me back into it.

00:28:54.480 --> 00:29:00.260 position:56%
So you know, that sort of mainstream
pop culture and what was being done

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.880
on TV inspired me in the very
beginning to start moving

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.900 position:56%
like a popper with robotics and
tick motion and gliding in the feet.

00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:13.760
I was also into the movies
"Breakin" and "Beat Street",

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.740
I found those next and I
wanted to break as well,

00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.430
and there was always boogie boys
in those videos that were poppers

00:29:20.430 --> 00:29:24.370
and B-boys, so I was like
these are my two things, right.

00:29:24.370 --> 00:29:28.760
I grew up in northern Virginia out
in Ashburn near Dulles airport,

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.000
so suburb, right, not
an urban setting,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.060
hence the mainstream
media influence.

00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.880
And I told my mom I was
like hey I want to go

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:39.740
to this competition I saw online,
there was a dance competition.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.960
This was about 2000.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:45.570
So we drove out to D.C.
and went to a B-boy contest

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:48.830
that was happening at
a local dance studio.

00:29:48.830 --> 00:29:53.760 position:56%
And I started taking classes from
the B-boy instructors at the studio.

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.120
And I eventually a group at
the time called Pure Energy

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.420
and Back to Basics.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:03.040
And we started going to some of the
first local battles in the area.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:05.270
The first one I went to was
called Breakers Delight,

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:08.010
that's where I met some of
the people in the group.

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.870
And then two years later
they did the same event

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.040
with a popping contest and
I entered that contest.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:17.450
So in the beginning dance
for me was very much I want

00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:21.770
to win these battles, I want to
do cool movements aesthetically

00:30:21.770 --> 00:30:28.020
that look amazing and drop
people's jaws and impress people.

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:32.180
And the longer that I did it,
the more dancers that I met,

00:30:32.180 --> 00:30:35.120
I started to realize there was
more of a culture to this thing,

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.730
specifically after I moved
to California for college,

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.220
I was dancing with
some people out there.

00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:44.130
But before I left I
met Rashaad in 2005

00:30:44.130 --> 00:30:46.990
and we had a practice session
together just one time,

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.200
we had a mutual friend
that was a dancer,

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.590
we practiced together
one time and then we kept

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:53.820
in touch a little bit
while I was in California.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.120
Every summer I would come
home to spend my two months

00:30:57.120 --> 00:30:59.830
over here before I
would go back and me

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.160
and Rashaad started
training together.

00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:07.270
And Rashaad was already carrying
the mentality of Urban Artistry

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:11.420
which is like, again, like we
want to have fun with dance

00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:14.280
but let's take it seriously,
let's do dance research,

00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.050
let's be anthropologists about
dance, let's learn to be leaders

00:31:18.050 --> 00:31:21.120
within the community, let's
learn history and culture.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.740
And he's my mentor within the
group and he started breaking some

00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:27.610
of those elements down for me,
teaching my about the purpose

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.140
of the cypher, the
purpose of the community,

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.300
how to treat each other
in that environment.

00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:36.180
And breaking down a lot of the
details that as like an outsider

00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.490
of the culture I wouldn't
really have known.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:42.150
And so for me it was important
that I did meet Rashaad

00:31:42.150 --> 00:31:45.620
and have the relationship that we
have because he kind of coached me

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:48.470
through that and made
things clear for me.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:51.860
Also so that I could
be respectful of being

00:31:51.860 --> 00:31:55.870
like European-American learning
an African-American tradition.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:02.170
And since then my growth has
doubled, tripled, just keeps going

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:07.000
up because now I'm looking at it
from a more holistic approach,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.430
it's not just about movement.

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:12.960
It's everything that comes involved
with the culture, let's dig deep

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:17.170
in all of those different
elements and not just isolate one,

00:32:17.170 --> 00:32:20.120
let's put it all together
and see it for what it is,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:24.130
and I think that has helped
me to really grow into my own

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:27.950
within the culture and it
helped me to become a leader

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:31.520
within the community as
well and Urban Artistry.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.270
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: You bring
up this idea of researching

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:36.030
and being folklorists
or anthropologists.

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:40.310 position:56%
I'm curious, I know BarenHawk you're
from the D.C. metro area as well,

00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.030
you're from New York and the
suburbs of D.C. metro area.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:49.090
I'm wondering about the importance
of place and particular styles.

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.850
And if there are any
distinctive styles to New York,

00:32:51.850 --> 00:32:54.510
I mean I know the answer's
yes and as well as here,

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:57.040
but just the musical
traditions of these areas,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:33:00.810
how did that influence you and
is there that uniqueness of place

00:33:00.810 --> 00:33:03.780
that also was an influence
in your lives?

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:07.460
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson:
Anybody want to take it?

00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.760
Go for it.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:12.230
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier: I grew
up in Beltsville which is

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.450
in Prince George's County.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:18.260
And the unique thing about that
part of Prince George's county is

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.260
that I lived right off of 95.

00:33:20.260 --> 00:33:25.620
So I kind of lived in
between Baltimore and D.C.

00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:28.980
So I was getting Baltimore
club music when I was a kid,

00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:31.030
and at the same time I
would flip a radio station

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:33.280
and I would hear D.C. Go-go.

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:37.970
And hearing both of those
different, very very different,

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:43.800
types of music happening at
the same time, it kind of--

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:45.930
well I was already listening
to a lot of different types

00:33:45.930 --> 00:33:52.330
of music already, but it helped
me understand my area even more

00:33:52.330 --> 00:33:56.200
and helped me understanding
how diverse Maryland

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.390
and D.C. really are.

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:03.010 position:56%
From Baltimore club music they would
also mix in some house music as well

00:34:03.010 --> 00:34:04.920
so you would hear a lot of--

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.320
we didn't even realize that they
were classic Chicago house songs,

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.580
we just thought that they
were Baltimore club songs,

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:15.230
but like the percolator would be
mixed in and dropped in it's just

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.810
because it was such a very
popular song, it would get mixed in

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:20.730
and dropped in and that's
actually Chicago house music.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:23.980
And there were a lot of songs
like that, you would catch a lot

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:28.180
of Chicago DJ's actually
working in Baltimore

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:30.710
and they'd be playing a
lot of Chicago house music

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.760
so you would get a taste of that.

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:40.290 position:56%
And on the D.C. side, go-go music is
essentially if you think about it,

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:45.800
it's the story of hip-hop in
D.C., that's our version of it.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:51.840 position:56%
And so through that I got into R and
B and they were covering a lot of R

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.030
and B songs, a lot of popular R
and B songs, a lot of hip-hop songs

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.830
of the day, a lot of
rap songs of the day.

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.100
So I was exposed to a lot of
different things just listening

00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:05.790
to our local radio stations that
were playing the unique music here.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.030 position:56%
And those two genres were only here.

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:14.510
That's just two, New York had
a million things going on,

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:16.500
Philly had their own
music, even down south,

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.670
North Carolina had
something going on,

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:23.770
Miami of course had their
own thing going on, so locals

00:35:23.770 --> 00:35:30.330
and regions definitely change
music and they change culturally

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:32.640
and it's fascinating
listening to it.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.960
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And I know

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:38.030
that there're many different origin
stories for some of these styles,

00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:42.390
but I think one story is that
B-boying, and B-girling, is--

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:48.730
this one story, it's very
much connected to the Bronx,

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:51.070
if I'm not mistaken, is that any,

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:54.040
would Rashaad like to
speak a bit about that?

00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:55.340
Breaking or-- ?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.580
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson: I could
speak a little bit about that.

00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.210
I'm not a practitioner of the style

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:04.810
but I have paid attention
to it for enough years.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.630
So it is one of many
urban dances that come

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:13.050
from like an underprivileged
neighborhood.

00:36:13.050 --> 00:36:17.140
I think Mean [phonetic] said
it really nice like earlier

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:24.550
about in terms of how it evolved
from a two-step and then you start

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.180
to build it and you step out and
maybe you'll just drop to the floor

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:30.610
and someone would stay on the
floor a little bit longer,

00:36:30.610 --> 00:36:33.830
and a little bit longer, and people
started to build from each other.

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:39.290
I think people get inspired
by what's around them,

00:36:39.290 --> 00:36:42.510 position:56%
and I think that's really important.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:46.260
Sometimes you don't
see the bigger picture.

00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.660
Like, a large picture
is down the block.

00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.570
Going downtown is a
big deal, you know.

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:55.130
And I remember growing up in
Harlem, we weren't even allowed

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.700
to even go up the ave, you now.

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.330
It was like no you
can't go down there

00:36:58.330 --> 00:37:00.210 position:56%
because there's trouble or whatever.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.630
And so making it is
going to the Rucker,

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.450
making it is being famous
in your neighborhood.

00:37:06.450 --> 00:37:13.530
So I think a through line for
most of the dances is going to be

00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:17.410
that when you start to move forward
and things start to become not

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:20.590
so isolated to the community,

00:37:20.590 --> 00:37:23.080
this is where there's a lot
more cultural exchanges.

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.910
So when Baron is talking about how
Chicago house music is inserted

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:31.470
in Baltimore city, but people

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.940
in Baltimore think
it's a Baltimore thing,

00:37:33.940 --> 00:37:37.400
they don't realize well wait a
minute we're actually learning

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.580
something about someone
else's culture.

00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:42.070
And it's the same thing that
was happening in the Bronx.

00:37:42.070 --> 00:37:45.810
People were infusing
the Latin Hustle,

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:49.650
people were doing the rock dance,
people were B-boying and B-girling.

00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.230
And so there were so many different
types of music, there was salsa

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:56.020
and merengue and funk and jazz

00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:02.010
and like it was just black
music, it was just that.

00:38:02.010 --> 00:38:07.840
I don't remember growing up hearing
someone say you're doing this dance

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.590
style, or you're doing, this is
this music, this is funk or--

00:38:12.590 --> 00:38:15.540
it was just what was played.

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.580
And like oh play that old
song, I remember how that felt.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:22.510
And so there was a lot of that.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:24.720
And that was our higher
intelligence,

00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:27.680
that was how we shared
with each other.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:31.110
And it's continually
happening today.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:41.400
And yeah so I think boogalooing,
locking, house, hip-hop, wacking,

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:45.130
punking, I mean you can go through
all the different urban dances

00:38:45.130 --> 00:38:48.530
and common story will be that.

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:53.360
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: So let's
go back to Urban Artistry.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.580
And I thank you guys so much,
you've painted such a picture

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.060
of this rich web, interconnected
web of all these styles and genres

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:03.490
and their evolution and exchanging.

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:07.070
So how does Urban Artistry
tackle that?

00:39:07.070 --> 00:39:10.330
Because I know you're not just in
the business of teaching, right?

00:39:10.330 --> 00:39:12.570
You mentioned earlier
there's research.

00:39:12.570 --> 00:39:16.590
I love that you use this
term citizen folklorous

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.010
that you've coined, that
you're all researchers

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:23.850
in understanding the roots
and these multiple stories.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:28.570
So how does that play out with
Urban Artistry, this research arm?

00:39:28.570 --> 00:39:33.050
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: So I
think it starts with the idea

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:40.890
of having people respect
who they are first.

00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:48.670 position:56%
Doing research about other people in
their culture and their communities

00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:51.670
and the things that they like
and enjoy is always good,

00:39:51.670 --> 00:40:02.550 position:56%
but I honestly don't think you truly
can do that without knowing self.

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:06.700
And the reason why I say that
is because to learn something

00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:11.230
about someone else you'll find
things that you disagree with.

00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:14.700
You'll be like oh no I don't really
like that, or that's strange,

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:16.980
or that's weird, you know?

00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:24.060
And if you don't feel like you know
yourself enough and that you care

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:28.060
about yourself enough to allow
yourself to be imperfect,

00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:31.190
it's going to be really
difficult to accept

00:40:31.190 --> 00:40:33.670
and understand other
people's imperfections.

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:39.240
So I wanted to start there.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:47.790
It's, you know, when you want to
teach a white kid from Ashburn

00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:55.300
about like what's going on in the
projects and Memphis, Tennessee,

00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.690
like it's important to
teach him to love himself

00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.830
and to respect what he has to bring
to the table and what he's learned

00:41:04.830 --> 00:41:07.330
in his communities and
what he grew up with.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.190
Because that's valuable too.

00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:11.720
It's not this idea that just

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:15.450
because brown people are
doing it it's more important.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.320
I don't think that's the case.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:24.100
I think it's beautiful because it's
beautiful and it has very little

00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:26.480
to do with the people
who are doing it.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:32.310
It has something to do with the
soul and the culture behind it.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:35.240
So I think that's where
we try to start.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:41.320
And bringing that to
an organization means

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:45.960
that we have these different arms
and these different directorates

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.400
where we can encourage that.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.550
And I'll let you talk about that

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:53.970
since you're our director
of education.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:57.180
&gt;&gt; Ryan Webb: Sure, so
in terms of research,

00:41:57.180 --> 00:42:01.090
we have a project we call
the Preservatory Project

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:05.150
and basically what Junious was just
explaining, it's about reaching

00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:12.540 position:56%
out to often what we consider unsung
heroes within the arts communities,

00:42:12.540 --> 00:42:15.700
urban arts communities,
not just dance.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.390
And we want to share their stories,

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:24.070 position:56%
not only to give others a more
holistic approach of who's out there

00:42:24.070 --> 00:42:28.590
and what's available in terms of
information, because sometimes even

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:34.760
within our, I don't want to
call it underground community,

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.740
but the subculture that we know
of, there still becomes the sort

00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.970
of trendy things that happen

00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:43.930
and certain people get
more limelight than others.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.250
So we basically wanted to
shine light in the places

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.390
where they weren't being shined
and allow those people also

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:53.980
to document their own
stories from their voices,

00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:55.710
not someone else telling
their story.

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:01.590
So one chapter that we do is
called boogaloo traditions,

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:07.200
and that is specifically for
the popping and boogaloo section

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.700
that myself and Rashaad
kind of spearhead.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.400
So we've done some really
nice interviews so far

00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:18.090
with different people like
Damon Frost and Boogaloo Dana

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:24.030
and Boogaloo Vic from
Oakland, Regis from Paris,

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.840
Sensei Bop from south central LA,

00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.160
and basically it's been
a really nice thing

00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:34.950
because not only are they able to
share what they've been through

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.580
and add their perspective
into the overall story,

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.590
but it's also just a learning
experience in general.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:44.180 position:56%
I'm really learning a lot from doing
it because I'm gaining knowledge

00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:46.330
at the same time, the
things that they're talking

00:43:46.330 --> 00:43:49.640
about are actually inspiring me.

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.640 position:56%
And we try to give that back by
staying connected with these people.

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:57.640 position:56%
We bring them out for our events and
try to honor them in different ways.

00:43:57.640 --> 00:44:02.180
And if they would like we put
that information out to kind

00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:05.960
of promote them and
hopefully give them some work

00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:07.550
and different things,
more attention.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:12.780
So that's basically what we're
doing in the Preservatory Project.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:17.520
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: We also have
the Urban Artistry Dance Academy

00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:22.730
where we have workshops and
classes throughout the week

00:44:22.730 --> 00:44:26.010
to teach these styles.

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:30.030
We also have a program, a
project that we're doing,

00:44:30.030 --> 00:44:34.220 position:56%
it's a genome project that we
started doing informally where a lot

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.770
of us are getting our DNA done
and doing out family histories

00:44:37.770 --> 00:44:41.940
and connecting with someone else
in the group who might not be

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.900
from that culture and sharing
that experience with them.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:51.860
Not just the actual results but
actually art that comes from there.

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:55.910
Just an effort to keep us
growing because I think

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:00.280
as Americans sometimes
we get into that groove,

00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.160
you know, we're just Americans.

00:45:04.230 --> 00:45:09.730
And that's great, I like Americans,
but I think it's important

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:14.340
to also have an identity,
especially for people

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:19.360
who don't have the privilege
as people who may come from,

00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:25.600 position:56%
people who were separated from their
racial identities and so forth.

00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:29.440
So I think it's important
to use that as a tool.

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:36.460
I know for me, when I got my DNA
done it was like this big deal,

00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:43.280
and then when I started meeting
people that were the descendants

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.600
of the people who enslaved my
ancestors, we started connecting

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:52.150
and started having these
conversations, it changed my art.

00:45:52.150 --> 00:45:55.200
You know, it changed my
work in the community.

00:45:55.200 --> 00:46:01.370
And I think projects and
programs like that helps

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.610
to enforce what we're trying to do

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:07.700
when we're saying identity
is important,

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.000
just as important as culture.

00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:16.930
Yeah, so we have all these little
sections and these programs but all

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:20.930
of that comes through and
is built on the foundation

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.060
of our mentorship program.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:28.450
And that mentorship program
works just as simple as from me

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:33.530
to Rashaad, from Rashaad to Ryan,
you know, we just keep doing

00:46:33.530 --> 00:46:36.330
that over the past 12 years.

00:46:36.330 --> 00:46:42.940
We've kept passing on what
we're doing to other people

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:46.050
in our community and
outside of our community.

00:46:46.050 --> 00:46:51.690
And hopefully they'll take and
make that same promise to continue

00:46:51.690 --> 00:46:54.550
to do that for other people.

00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:55.850
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
And on top of it all,

00:46:55.850 --> 00:47:00.070
I mean obviously Urban Artistry
is not just about dance.

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.370
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: No, no.

00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:03.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And as you were
saying, this holistic understanding

00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:06.350
of not just dance culture,
just culture.

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:09.370
And identity and community and
how to foster those senses.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:13.980
But I do know you also, on top
of it all, Urban Artistry puts

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:17.520
on 20 plus events a year?

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:18.820
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Yeah.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.110
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And they
range in all sorts of art forms.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:25.300
Would someone want to talk
a little bit about that?

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.790
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson: I
can talk about it, yeah.

00:47:26.790 --> 00:47:30.740
Just when you said 20 I was
like wow is it really that much?

00:47:30.740 --> 00:47:32.360
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
That's what he said.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.680
[ Laughter ]

00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:37.510
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson: So throughout
the year we're really trying

00:47:37.510 --> 00:47:40.250
to show how three-dimensional
we are.

00:47:40.250 --> 00:47:45.560
Like House-- I'm sorry,
Junious, really instilled in us

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.700
that it's important to show range
in our thinking, it's important

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:54.570
to show range in our art and value
all the things that we can be.

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:59.120
And so with that we try to
extend that to local community,

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:02.500
national community,
and then international.

00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:05.930
So some of the events that we
are doing here will be connected

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:10.740
to the Preservatory Project where
we'll hold like presentations

00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:16.030
and we'll have like a projector out
and have people see the interviews

00:48:16.030 --> 00:48:19.010
that took place and
we'll discuss them.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:22.530
Sometimes we're doing panel
discussions where we'll talk

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:26.620
about conflict resolution,
how do we deal

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.820
with the battle after it was done.

00:48:28.820 --> 00:48:31.510
Are we going to stay in our egos
or are we going to try and figure

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:34.810
out how to come together and
work through these solutions

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:38.370
and not be all in our head and
sensitive about these things.

00:48:38.370 --> 00:48:42.250
Learning from our past,
we'll do some events

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:46.710
that are a bit more broad and
we'll connect dance with poetry

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.760
or we'll do some theater
productions.

00:48:48.760 --> 00:48:51.930
And we'll try to do some
performances for children,

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.270
I think we did one at the Discovery
Theater a couple weeks ago.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:49:01.790 position:56%
We also just did a performance in
Glenn Falls, New York where we tried

00:49:01.790 --> 00:49:10.310 position:56%
to talk about current events through
theater and put our personal stories

00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:13.390
on the stage for people
to get that as well.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:18.070 position:56%
Once a year we have the
International Soul Society Festival,

00:49:18.070 --> 00:49:20.570
I believe the first
one was like 2009,

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:22.710
you guys correct me if I'm wrong.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:28.830
And that week is just like full of
art; it's dance, it's conversation,

00:49:28.830 --> 00:49:32.980
it's eating, it's the
laughter, it's the tears.

00:49:32.980 --> 00:49:39.290
So 20 events, actually that might
not be how many events we're

00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:40.590
really doing.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:44.720
Because we live this
thing, so we don't stop.

00:49:44.720 --> 00:49:47.260
This happens every day.

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:51.620
We wake up and it's like our
time clock is just always on,

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:55.000
we don't get to cut that
off like everyone else.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.930
And I think that's the work that
isn't really visible when it comes

00:49:59.930 --> 00:50:04.930
to urban dance because
there isn't this academia,

00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:06.920
there isn't this school
that we can go to,

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.280
we can't wake up in the morning
and clock in and be, okay I'm going

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:16.140 position:56%
to be-- that just doesn't happen, so
we're making our way from nothing.

00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:22.110
And the mentorship really
helps foster how we can make

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.540
that happen better for ourselves.

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:28.270
We look at all the mistakes that
we made and we go okay guys,

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:32.010
we've got to shape up, and
this is where we start to work

00:50:32.010 --> 00:50:34.510
in the loyalty and the
respect for each other.

00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:36.630
This is where we start to check
each other and be like dude,

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:40.010
you messed that up, or girl
you need to get this better.

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:43.490
And so these are all
our events, you know?

00:50:43.490 --> 00:50:45.130
The conversations that are tough,

00:50:45.130 --> 00:50:47.740
the conversations that
are really easy.

00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:55.640
And we just really want to make
sure that we are not unsung heroes.

00:50:55.640 --> 00:51:03.790 position:56%
We want to be in the forefront, here
we are, and be as honest as we can

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:09.210
so people can feel this thing
and see that this take a lifetime

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:12.420
of work and even something that
we might not even be around for,

00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:13.900
and hope that it can carry

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.970
on through some other
people; my kids, their kids.

00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:19.720
You know, this is where
we're going, so.

00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:24.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: I think one
of the things that was key for me is

00:51:24.850 --> 00:51:31.930
that when I moved here in 2005 from
Europe, in Europe there were all

00:51:31.930 --> 00:51:37.030
of these different crews and
all of these dance schools

00:51:37.030 --> 00:51:41.170
and dance programs
that were well funded

00:51:41.170 --> 00:51:48.100
and we had corporate sponsors,
like when we had shows we would go

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:55.100
to Puma or go to like Nike and ask
them for gear, they give us gear,

00:51:55.100 --> 00:51:57.270
I was like this is great!

00:51:57.270 --> 00:52:01.820
And when I came back to the
states we didn't have that.

00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:04.780
Like some of these
things weren't accessible.

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:08.400
So an important lesson
to teach everyone was

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.740
like you know sometimes the money's
not going to be there to ask for,

00:52:13.740 --> 00:52:19.140
so we have to be able to
fund our own programming.

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:25.400
Yes, we can write grants and
request and ask people to donate,

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:31.480
but for the most part if we're
waiting for that handout,

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.380
so to speak, or if we're
waiting for that blessing,

00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:36.860
then we could be waiting forever.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:43.740
We could miss the opportunity to be
who we are because we were waiting

00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:47.390
for someone else to
come and do it for us.

00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:49.010
So we had to invest.

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:52.710
And once you personally
invest, you know,

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:56.750
it's like okay, I love
this even more.

00:52:56.750 --> 00:53:00.310
I paid for it, I earned it.

00:53:00.310 --> 00:53:04.690
You know, that's a
joke but it's real.

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:10.540
And I think for me that
was the drive behind that.

00:53:10.540 --> 00:53:16.760
Coming here and seeing all of these
talented people investing in things

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.940
that didn't want to invest in them.

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:26.960
I mean, yeah it's fine that we meet
in the club on Saturday and Sunday

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:30.590
and get down, why don't we
meet on Monday, Tuesday,

00:53:30.590 --> 00:53:33.860
Wednesday somewhere else and
do something to make sure

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:38.050
that our organization
is run better, you know?

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:42.160
To make sure that we create more
opportunities for each other.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.650
And especially when it
came to dance schools,

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:54.080 position:56%
only most of the dance organizations
were attached to dance schools.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.320
And I didn't come from that,

00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:03.600
so my idea was let's just build
dance crews and a dance company.

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:09.550 position:56%
And people were like oh well what
dance school are you guys a part of?

00:54:09.550 --> 00:54:13.060
We're like what's that mean?

00:54:13.060 --> 00:54:16.470
Oh yeah we rent space
from this dance school.

00:54:16.470 --> 00:54:19.860
Oh, we're residents
at this dance school.

00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:24.610
But we are an independent
organization, independent people

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:29.930
with a lot of ideas and a lot
of drive and a lot of hard work.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:34.590
And I think that goes back
to like that was the spark

00:54:34.590 --> 00:54:36.800
that I saw when I came here.

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:40.450
It was like, man, so
many talented people.

00:54:40.450 --> 00:54:46.390
But that was really tough, you
know like to kind of put ourselves

00:54:46.390 --> 00:54:51.010
out there and be like hey
guys we can do better,

00:54:51.010 --> 00:54:55.570
and a lot of people disagreed.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.700
Some people are just
happy with what they got.

00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.450
And I was doing my best not to
seem like a big-headed dude but be

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.680
like hey you know there's
other things out there,

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:07.160
there's other opportunities, guys,

00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.820
if you go to this country
they're doing this,

00:55:10.820 --> 00:55:13.810
if you go to this country
they're doing that.

00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:17.030
And some people got it.

00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:23.230
And I think that that's what makes
me happy, like that people got it

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:26.770
and they signed up for the work

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:32.690
and 12 years later
people are still working.

00:55:32.690 --> 00:55:33.990
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
How are we doing,

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:36.360
can we keep going or
what do you suggest?

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:38.030
How are you guys doing, number one?

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:39.980
Yeah, you're feeling
okay, not too hot?

00:55:39.980 --> 00:55:41.280
Okay.

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.580
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson: It's hot.

00:55:42.580 --> 00:55:43.880
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse:
Yeah, it's a little hot.

00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:45.180
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: A little hot?

00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:46.480
How about I ask just
two more questions,

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:47.780
keep it as brief as you like.

00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:53.420
Okay. So for those who
are interested in checking

00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:58.230
out a little more of what Urban
Artistry does or even to check

00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:59.990
out some classes at
the dance academy,

00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:01.820
how would they go about that?

00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:07.500
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: You could
just reach us at UrbanArtistry.org

00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:10.920
and yeah, we have our class
schedules there, our events,

00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.670
what we're doing, our
staff and so forth.

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.050
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And is
there anything they need to do

00:56:15.050 --> 00:56:18.710
to mentally prepare ahead of time?

00:56:18.710 --> 00:56:22.040
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: I would
say just be open, you know.

00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:27.160
Be as open as you want
people to be open to you.

00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.090
We're an organization that's
very serious about our art forms

00:56:32.090 --> 00:56:35.370
but we're also very serious
about being kind to people

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:38.170
and creating communities,
so that counts too.

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:41.600
We're not going to
hip-hop cop you to death.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.800 position:56%
You know like we want people to
come and be a part of our community,

00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.060
but we're also interested in
learning about them as well.

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.100
So just come with an open mind.

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:52.400
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: Cool.

00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:55.870
For each of you, and you can answer
this of course however you'd like,

00:56:55.870 --> 00:57:00.200
what does the future hopefully
have in store for Urban Artistry

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:05.250
which you're all so dedicated
to but personally as well.

00:57:05.250 --> 00:57:08.350
&gt;&gt; Baronhawk Poitier:
For me, more traveling.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:12.040
There're so many more
countries that are on my list

00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.180
that I would love to visit.

00:57:15.180 --> 00:57:19.250
That's my thing, I would love
to see more of the world.

00:57:19.250 --> 00:57:23.960
That's definitely a future,
that's definitely going to happen.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.840
&gt;&gt; Ryan Webb: I think this
is something that's already

00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:29.410
in the works, but the
education that we provide

00:57:29.410 --> 00:57:34.970 position:56%
at the academy is very collegiate, I
feel it's on a level that this type

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:38.270
of programming would fit
very well into universities,

00:57:38.270 --> 00:57:41.480 position:56%
and I'd like to see universities all

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:44.690
over America including urban
dance programming, you know,

00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:45.990
something you can major in.

00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:48.530
Because I know if I had
that option when I was

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:51.320
in college I would
have chose to do that.

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:56.300
So I think that's one
big thing for me.

00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.430
&gt;&gt; Rashaad Pearson: I think
more recently I've been inspired

00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:02.730
by a talk we had a couple weeks ago

00:58:02.730 --> 00:58:06.830
and it was mentioned
that we're all farmers.

00:58:06.830 --> 00:58:10.380
And this really registered
because the idea

00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:16.900
that a farmer cultivates land to
feed people, you try to make sure

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:20.390
that your land doesn't
get poisoned and this

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:24.650
like metaphor really hit home
because I'm a dad, you know,

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.450
so I have two little
girls, nine and four.

00:58:27.450 --> 00:58:31.130
And so I thought about them
immediately and then I looked back

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:34.640
on all the work that we've been
doing and I was like wow okay,

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.840
this is it, we're farmers.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:40.700
And so I just want to
continue to extend, you know,

00:58:40.700 --> 00:58:45.130
giving out healthy education and
building like healthy relationships

00:58:45.130 --> 00:58:46.430
with people around the world.

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:48.810
So that's what I want to do.

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:51.310
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano:
That's wonderful.

00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:53.480
I know you also consider
yourself a farmer.

00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:54.780
&gt;&gt; Junious Brickhouse: Absolutely.

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:57.520
Absolutely, until the day I die.

00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.070
And then some.

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:06.660
You know, this is who
I am and the work

00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:11.690
that we do is what I
want to continue doing.

00:59:11.690 --> 00:59:16.160
We have a lot of goals but
I think my main goal is

00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:20.340
to not stop doing great
things, you know,

00:59:20.340 --> 00:59:24.010
in the communities
that I practice in.

00:59:24.010 --> 00:59:27.990
To just keep enjoying life.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:31.030
It's work but, you
know, it's heart work,

00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:37.580
it's stuff that makes me feel
good, it's stuff that I know

00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.150
that I can pass on to others.

00:59:40.150 --> 00:59:46.170
So my wish and my goal
is to keep being us

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:50.730
and keep helping people
who want the help.

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.420
&gt;&gt; Michelle Stefano: And if there's
anything else you'd like to add

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:59.690
or something I should ask
if you feel-- are we good?

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.360
We ready to take a nap?

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:03.700
[ Laughter ]

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:05.000
Okay, well thank you.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.210
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
