The transform widget
can transform even a simple app

00:00:10.509 --> 00:00:12.152
into something amazing.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.227
Transforms like this are possible
because Flutter does its own rendering.

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:19.653
Do you want a menu icon 
rotated 45 degrees?

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:22.132
A fancy animated transition?

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.019
Maybe a bouncy carousel?

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.938
Or even a cool menu?

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:29.529
All of these things use Transform widgets.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.528
To rotate something 45 degrees,

00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:33.451
just wrap it in a Transform widget

00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:35.823
using Transform's Rotate constructor.

00:00:35.823 --> 00:00:38.344
Other simple transforms are Scale

00:00:39.104 --> 00:00:40.305
and Translate.

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.583
There are many more 
less common transformations.

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:43.830
You can create them by building

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.779
a four-by-four transformation 
matrix explicitly.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.880
Here is a Skew transform.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.816
Here is a matrix for doing 3D perspective.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.092
Perspective works
particularly well in animations.

00:00:55.527 --> 00:00:57.550
Here's another example of perspective

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.634
but applied to an entire app.

00:00:59.634 --> 00:01:00.902
To build an app that does this,

00:01:00.902 --> 00:01:04.767
see the link for <i>Perspective on Flutter</i>
in the comments for this video.

00:01:05.372 --> 00:01:07.353
For more information 
on the Transform widget,

00:01:07.353 --> 00:01:09.340
