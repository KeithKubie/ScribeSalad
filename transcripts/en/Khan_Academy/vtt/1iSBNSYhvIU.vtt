00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:02.140
- [Voiceover] Let's see if
we can figure out the surface

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.647
area of this cereal box.

00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:06.783
And there's a couple of ways to tackle it.

00:00:06.783 --> 00:00:08.966
The first way is, well let's
figure out the surface area

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.601
of the sides that we can
see, and then think about

00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:14.143
what the surface area of the
sides that we can't see are

00:00:14.143 --> 00:00:16.488
and how they might relate, and
then add them all together.

00:00:16.488 --> 00:00:17.638
So let's do that.

00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:20.284
So the front of the box
is 20 centimeters tall

00:00:20.284 --> 00:00:21.805
and 10 centimeters wide.

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:24.417
It's a rectangle, so to figure
out its area we can just

00:00:24.417 --> 00:00:27.006
multiply 20 centimeters
times 10 centimeters,

00:00:27.006 --> 00:00:29.862
and that's going to
give us 200 centimeters.

00:00:29.862 --> 00:00:34.435
200 centimeters, or 200 square
centimeters, I should say.

00:00:34.435 --> 00:00:36.212
200 square centimeters,
that's the area of the front.

00:00:36.212 --> 00:00:38.789
And let me write it right
over here as well, 200.

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.589
Now we also know there's
another side that has the

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.911
exact same area as the
front of the box, and that's

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:44.489
the back of the box.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.136
And so let's write another
200 square centimeters

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.830
for the back of the box.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.908
Now let's figure out the
area of the top of the box.

00:00:51.908 --> 00:00:55.494
The top of the box, we see the
box is three centimeters deep

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:59.599
so this right over here
is three centimeters.

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:02.444
It's three centimeters deep
and it's 10 centimeters wide.

00:01:02.444 --> 00:01:04.475
We see the box is 10 centimeters wide.

00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:06.321
So the top of the box is
gonna be three centimeters

00:01:06.321 --> 00:01:09.884
times 10 centimeters, which
is 30 square centimeters

00:01:09.884 --> 00:01:11.057
of area.

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:13.681
So that's the top of the
box, 30 square centimeters.

00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.317
Well, the bottom of the
box is gonna have the exact

00:01:15.317 --> 00:01:17.860
same area, we just can't
see it right now, so that's

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.881
gonna be another 30.

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:22.364
Then we have two more sides,
cuz this box has six sides,

00:01:22.364 --> 00:01:26.301
We have this side panel
that is 20 centimeters tall,

00:01:26.301 --> 00:01:28.540
we see that the height of
the box is 20 centimeters

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.653
and three centimeters deep.

00:01:32.523 --> 00:01:37.121
So three times 20, let me
write that a little bit neater.

00:01:37.121 --> 00:01:41.305
Three times 20,

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:44.135
that's 20 centimeters right there.

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:45.633
Three centimeters times 20 centimeters is

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:48.481
going to give us 60 square centimeters.

00:01:51.008 --> 00:01:52.665
Now that's this side
panel, but there's another

00:01:52.665 --> 00:01:54.674
side panel that has the
exact same area that's

00:01:54.674 --> 00:01:56.451
on the other side of the box, so it's

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:59.330
60 centimeters squared for this side,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.651
and then another 60 for
the corresponding side

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.589
opposite to it that we can't see.

00:02:03.589 --> 00:02:06.156
And now we can just add
up all of these together.

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:09.970
And so we get zero, this is going to be

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:14.539
carry the one, or regroup
the one, it's a 100,

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.257
and then we have 500.

00:02:16.257 --> 00:02:20.796
So we get 580 square
centimeters is the surface area

00:02:20.796 --> 00:02:23.182
of this box.
