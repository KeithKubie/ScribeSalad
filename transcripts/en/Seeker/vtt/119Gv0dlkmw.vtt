00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.600
We’re in the middle of a billion dollar
telescope building boom.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.040
The Giant Magellan Telescope.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.800
Thirty Meter Telescope and Europe’s Extremely
Large Telescope are all part of a new class

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.960
of ground based observatories that will peer
farther through space and further back in

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.960
time.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.400
“Astronomers are not very good with names.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.980
First we built big telescopes, and then we
made the very large telescope, and now we're

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.909
making extremely large telescopes.

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.880
But really what it means, it's about 10 times
larger than any telescope we have today.”

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.920
They’re all racing to see first light in
the 2020s.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.980
But why now?

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.210
How did we get here?

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:45.770
“Typically, the size of the largest telescope
on the earth doubles about every 40 years…

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.430
Around 2000 there were groups around the globe
who had just finished building telescopes

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.129
of about 8 and 10 meters in diameter, and
they recognized the technology could be used

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.870
to make telescopes even larger.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.739
And that was about the time... we discovered
that as astronomers we have no idea what's

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.120
actually going on in the universe.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.600
I mean no idea in the sense that we figured
out that 97% of the stuff in the universe

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.030
can't be seen and we don't know what it is.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.920
So that was a good motivation to build bigger
telescopes.”

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.670
“The technology got better for us to make
this quantum jump from, you know, eight meter

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.939
to 30 meter glass...This comes down to few
key elements.”

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.030
The first is a revolution in mirror size and
design.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.030
“The telescope performance are mostly driven
by the size of the primary mirror.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.680
The bigger the primary mirror, the more light
we can collect….That means we can go faint

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.909
into the universe, you can look at smaller
objects, more distant objects.”

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.460
The problem is you can't make one single mirror
any large than about 20 feet in diameter.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.240
There's just basic material properties in
the glass that make it very difficult.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.240
So...we have to make mirror segments.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.469
We take the parent optical surface and kind
of like with the biscuit cutter we cut it

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:01.020
into seven circles.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.450
We make them to one combined parent optical
surface that brings the light then to a single

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.450
focus.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.310
We have to then hold those mirrors in place
on a large steel structure that's stiff enough

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.550
that it doesn't shake in the wind, and it
doesn't sag under its own weight, and then

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.530
it has to be precise enough to steer across
the sky so that when we move to track the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.269
stars or the planets there's no vibration.

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.410
And we do that strangely enough by floating
the entire telescope, entire 1,000 tons on

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.120
a thin film of oil.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.720
The telescope simply floats on that in a way
that's completely frictionless.”

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.010
That’s the design for the Giant Magellan
Telescope, whereas the E-ELT will take a slightly

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.010
different approach.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.920
“The original idea was to build, not a forty
meter diameter, but 100 meter diameter.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:52.129
And that was called the Overwhelmingly Large
Telescope, that was so big.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.930
The engineers said "You know, this is really
too much for us.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:01.019
The shape of the telescope has to be precise
to few tenths of nanometers.

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:06.230
So, the width of a hair across the entire
forty meter diameter of the primary, which

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.890
is, actually, not even one single piece.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.200
It's made of 798 individual smaller mirrors.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.390
Each of them needs to be polished, extremely
accurate, and then controlled extremely accurate,

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.730
to mimic this uniform surface at the nanometer
level.”

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.819
These enormous precision machines will be
built in some of the driest and most remote

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.299
places on earth, complementing space telescopes
like Hubble and the soon to launch James Webb.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.900
“Hubble's pictures have been fantastic,
pioneering work.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.120
But, they are somehow they've been pushed
to their limit.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:49.150
So, what I'm expecting is this 30 meter telescopes
to do exactly the same revolution, as Hubble

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.850
did 20 years ago.”

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.860
But one major challenge these ground based
scopes have to contend with is our planet’s

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:55.860
atmosphere.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.379
“The problem is the light from the stars
that's traveled for millions of years or sometimes

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.120
billions of years through the universe and
through the galaxy, when it hits our atmosphere

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.580
the light kind of wiggles as it goes through.”

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.620
This is what gives the stars their classic
twinkle, but it causes problems for astronomers

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.379
who want super sharp images.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.460
This is where the next key advance comes in.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.900
“Recently over the last ten years, there's
been a lot of development, what is called

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.900
adaptive optics.”

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.420
Here’s how it works.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.660
Lasers from the telescope are shot into space,
exciting the atoms in the sodium layer of

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.730
the upper atmosphere and causing them to glow.

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.920
That glow acts as an artificial star that
astronomers can use to calculate the amount

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.690
of atmospheric turbulence.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.360
Then, the mirrors will flex and deform by
computer controlled actuators to correct the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.720
blur. “and, walla, you make sharp images.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.000
The challenge is you have to do that 500 to
1,000 times a second and you have to do that

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.390
to about 1/20th of the wavelength of light
in precision.”

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.940
With unprecedented light-collecting capability
and advanced optical geometry, these new observatories

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.600
will tackle some of the most complex questions
known to science.

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.800
“There's been a lot of recent discovery
of exoplanets...We can see, more or less,

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.990
how distant they are from the planet.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.340
But we would like to understand how they are
made of.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:18.380
Do they have an atmosphere which is similar
to Earth, or not?

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.560
How do you form all these planets?

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.370
That's only one aspect.

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:27.410
Then, understanding how different galaxies
formed and evolved across the cosmic time,

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.070
you know for 13.5 billion years.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.170
And then, we can move to cosmology and understanding
how dark matter and dark energy formed.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:40.700
We are increasing the size so much, the capabilities
are so powerful that it will open completely

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.230
new discoveries in space.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.970
And we don't really know where they will take
us, and that's to me the real beauty of this

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:48.980
new facilities.”

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.870
“Our telescopes while they might seem big
they're really small compared to the size

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.860
of the earth or the size of the universe,
so if we can collect more light, we have a

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.430
better chance of seeing those galaxies and
black holes back when the universe was less

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.880
than one billion years old.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.160
And that's one of our key drivers is to look
back and see when did we transition from the

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.080
universe being dark, the end of the dark ages
to the first time it lit up, what we call

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.120
cosmic dawn.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.780
That's something that all astronomers would
like to see and study the first light in the

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:20.780
universe.”

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.250
“The universe is a much bigger place than
just what we experience here in our daily

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:34.400
lives on the earth, and it enriches our lives
to simply understand that and to be aware

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.430
of it.”
