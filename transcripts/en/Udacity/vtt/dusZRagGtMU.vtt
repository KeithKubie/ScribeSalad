00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.980
This was a tough one.

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.770
Media queries can get complex.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:07.760
Especially when they start
overlapping like what we've got here.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.840
But, let's go ahead and
set through each part step by step.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.320
AA applies from zero to 300 and
also from 300 to 400.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.949
Which makes its max width, 400 pixels.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.770
BB starts at 301 pixels, so
we set its min-width to 301, and

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.930
it goes all the way to 600 pixels, so
we call that max-width, 600 pixels.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:39.380
CC starts at 601 pixels, so
we say it has a min-width of 601 pixels.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.670
And it doesn't have an end,
so there is no max width.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.030
DD seems to be the same as CC,
except it starts at 961 pixels.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.790
That wasn't too bad.
