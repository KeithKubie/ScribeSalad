CHRIS CARTLAND: Welcome to the
Google+ Partner Showcase.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.530
My name is Chris Cartland, and
I'm a developer programs

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.960
engineer working on the
Google+ Platform.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.370
Today, we're very lucky to have
with us a special guest.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.910
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Hi.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.880
I'm Lefteris Haritou.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.050
I'm working at Snapette
Incorporated.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.820
And I'm the lead Android
and iOS engineer there.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.530
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah, this
is really exciting.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.370
So since we launched Google+
Sign-In, we've had a lot of

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.310
different companies
and developers

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.450
integrate with Google+.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.100
But one thing we keep getting
asked is how's it working.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.080
And whose implementing this?

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.600
And tell me more about
what this is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.230
like in the real world.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.410
So today, we have Lefteris here
with us from Snapette to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.980
help talk about what it's
like in the real world.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.150
What it's been like integrating
with the product.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.170
How that has helped
the application.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.069
And so we're really excited to
get that real feedback from

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.160
someone like Lefteris.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.260
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah, we had
great success with the Google+

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.470
addition to our application.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.020
We've seen great numbers.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.930
We've seen an increase on total
users that are signing

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.290
up to our app.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.830
It was a very easy
integration.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.430
The documentation
is very clear.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.375
And it has been a success
story, basically.

00:01:26.375 --> 00:01:27.890
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
awesome.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.360
So can you explain a little bit
about your app, so we can

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.210
see why a user would
want to sign-in.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.110
Or why do you want the user
to sign-in to your app?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.610
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah, our
app is a mobile fashion

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.270
application.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.760
So it socially scores
to our application.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.120
So we want our users
to engage.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.400
So one way is through
user sign-up.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.950
And Google+ has significantly
helped here because it's a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.430
driver for new sign-ups.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.740
The more users that's signing
up with Google+ and sharing

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.700
with interactive posts, the more
users we are getting on

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.430
our platform.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.380
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
awesome.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.449
So before you had Google+
Sign-In, have you noticed the

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:12.050
change between that time
and now after you

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.820
have integrated it?

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.080
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.310
Actually, since we integrated
Google+, we've seen a bump of

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.080
about 7 or 8% on
total sign-ups.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.380
So with Google+ more users have
been willing to sign up

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590
to our application
and increase our

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.850
registered users database.

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.260
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.055
So in order to get that much
benefit, how much effort did

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:33.155
it take, like, in your
integration?

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:35.670
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah, the
integration was very easy.

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.680
We went through the
documentation,

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.820
which is very clear.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880
We benefited from the
sample code that is

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.400
available on the website.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.800
So it was very easy
implementation, quick

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.600
implementation, and
effortless.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.460
Everything went smoothly.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.240
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.890
Did you learn anything, while
integrating, that surprised

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.660
you either from the developer's
perspective or

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.760
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.810
LEFTERIS HARITOU: From the
developer's perspective,

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.710
nothing surprised us.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.480
I mean, the documentation was
there to provide to every

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.990
question and every answer
to our questions.

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.630
And like I said, the sample
code was a great start-up

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.660
because you can actually
download the sample code.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.805
And, pretty much,
use a lot of the

00:03:12.805 --> 00:03:13.860
sample code that's available.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.940
And just copy-paste it
inside your app, and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.500
get you quickly started.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.790
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.540
Yeah, so you've added Google+
sign-in but you had other ways

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.000
for a user to sign-in before.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.690
And I was wondering if you
have noticed how that has

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.870
compared to the previous ways
that a user could sign-in.

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.450
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.930
Our app is social.

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.440
So we get to [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.850
of signing up to our app.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.710
So in the Android Platform,
we've seen, naturally, that

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:42.100
since Google+ is available,
about 40 or 45% of our users

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.590
are using Google+ to sign-up
to the platform.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.210
On iOS the numbers
are a bit lower.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.420
But still they are about
the same with our

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.830
rather social providers.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.906
So it's actually doing very well
on that part, as well.

00:03:56.906 --> 00:03:58.140
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
very good.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.420
And between all of these
providers and the ones you've

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.500
added, do you have any numbers
about what the increase has

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.540
been from before and after?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.310
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.970
In total sign-ups, we went
from 43% of total user's

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.670
signing up on the app to 50%.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.050
And these numbers are, like I
said, 45% on Android, 40 or

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.789
45% are using Google+.

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:24.360
And on the iOS platform,
29% are using Google+.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.310
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.620
So you, actually, went from
less than half of your

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.890
visitors in your app had signed
in to now you have more

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.040
than half that have signed in.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.250
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Exactly.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.260
CHRIS CARTLAND: This is a
great way of converting

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.610
visitors within your app
to actual users.

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.020
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Exactly,
and that's what we

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.060
are trying to do.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.090
So we are trying to engage the
users to sign-up and get them

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.160
back to the app.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.270
This is one way.

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:50.620
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's
very good.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.030
Cool.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.540
So we've talked a lot
about sign-in.

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.820
And that's getting a user
to become a full

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:01.120
user in your app.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.330
And then, once they're there,
you mentioned a little bit

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.235
about interactive posts
and sharing.

00:05:05.235 --> 00:05:06.870
So I was wondering if you could
talk a little more about

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:07.600
that integration.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.900
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah, we use
both interactive post and

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.460
normal sharing in our app.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.180
So every social activity that
will take place in our app is

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.380
going to be shared
on your moments.

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.850
And there is also
the interactive

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.210
posts, which is great.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.870
We are benefiting from the
interactive post capability,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.450
so we are actually using the
deep linking capabilities.

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.820
So this is also a driver of
users to our app because

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.160
interactive post and [INAUDIBLE]
help getting users

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.135
to your app.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:36.510
CHRIS CARTLAND: Can you tell me
a little bit about what's

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:39.440
special about interactive
posts?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.930
LEFTERIS HARITOU: The
interactive post was very

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.810
easy, first of all,
implementing it.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.670
It's a quick implementation,
very easy to implement, and

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.670
the users have total
control over it.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.530
So it has been great for us.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.530
And it's also helping our
application getting more users

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.700
by the depleting capabilities
in our app.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.210
CHRIS CARTLAND: And there's a
call to action button in a

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.970
interactive post, which is how
interactive posts are special

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:07.910
from regular posts.

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:08.690
LEFTERIS HARITOU:
Exactly, yeah.

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.390
CHRIS CARTLAND: Could you tell
us what action you chose to

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:12.100
put on that?

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.580
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Yeah, the
action depends on what you are

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:16.550
going to see.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.620
So if an item is available for
e-commerce purchase through

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:25.740
our external links it will
show the buy label.

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.940
But if it's something that's
not available for buying

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.270
immediately, it will say want.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.990
CHRIS CARTLAND: Want, OK. so I
want this item, and you can

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.040
click that button
if you want it.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.270
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Exactly.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.150
CHRIS CARTLAND: And that takes
you, of course, deep into the

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.702
app, helps you download it, if
you don't have it already, and

00:06:39.702 --> 00:06:41.070
then you have it.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.250
Very good.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:45.070
How did you go about
the decision of

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.700
choosing that label?

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:50.400
I know I've talked with a lot
of developers who want to

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.070
implement interactive posts, and
it takes them some time to

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.300
figure out which label
to pick because

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.350
there's a bunch of them.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.800
LEFTERIS HARITOU: For us, it
was very straightforward

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.650
because we always hit the like
button, which indicates that

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.340
like is something that
you would want.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:10.040
So there was also no discussion
of whether we'd

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.550
call it like or want.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.610
So it was a very easy decision
for us making

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.310
the label as a want.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:20.720
And for buy, of course, it's
very straightforward.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.220
I mean, this item is available
for purchase, so you might

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.496
want to buy it.

00:07:25.496 --> 00:07:27.220
CHRIS CARTLAND: Great.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:34.360
And for the web component you
talked about the mobile apps.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.420
How important is mobile
to your application?

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.930
LEFTERIS HARITOU: We are a
mobile application, basically.

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.680
So this is our main part.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.000
We can go to the website, but
the main focus, right now, is

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.405
on the mobile applications.

00:07:47.405 --> 00:07:49.775
CHRIS CARTLAND: And have you
been able to take advantage of

00:07:49.775 --> 00:07:53.540
or use over the air installs in
order to help [INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:55.520
LEFTERIS HARITOU: This is
something that also helped us.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.090
We have also added the ability
for a user to sign-up on a

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.720
website with Google+.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.910
So we are also benefiting from
over the installation and

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:07.030
[INAUDIBLE] login.

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:08.320
CHRIS CARTLAND: And
I know that you

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.190
mostly worked on mobile.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.070
How hard was it for the web
team to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:14.850
LEFTERIS HARITOU: The web team
didn't hit any problems.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.990
There was also sample code
which they used samples

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.060
available documentation.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:25.110
So it was very easy to
implement, as well.

00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:27.580
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.090
Is there anything that you've
learned through integrating

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:35.750
either for Android developers or
for companies that want to

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:37.370
use Google+ in their
application?

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.515
Do you have any advice for
those kind of people?

00:08:39.515 --> 00:08:41.770
LEFTERIS HARITOU: My advice is,
first of all, go to the

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.059
documentation website.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:45.070
With the documentation
it's very clear.

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:47.300
It's very easy to read.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:48.970
Download the sample code.

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.400
Use that sample code in
your application.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.060
Take advantage of all
the features that

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:54.080
are available there.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.040
So use interactive posts.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.310
Use [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.780
[INAUDIBLE] is very powerful.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.410
It will drive people to
download your app.

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.460
So this is certainly something
you wouldn't want to miss.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.490
And benefit from whatever you
can from the technology.

00:09:07.490 --> 00:09:08.020
[? Seize it, ?]

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:10.380
implement, and it pays back.

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.930
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.790
And for all the links, we'll
post all the links with this

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:19.230
video so that you can go find
the documentation for yourself

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:20.480
at developers.google.com/+.

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.100
Is there anything else you'd
like to share about your

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.080
experience with Google?

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:32.340
So not just with the integration
but with using the

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.060
different features.

00:09:34.060 --> 00:09:36.510
How has this made your
product better?

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:38.730
LEFTERIS HARITOU: The product
is, first of all, made better

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.630
because it's easier for
a user to sign-up.

00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:44.420
We provide another option.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.550
Google+ is very popular.

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:50.720
Everyone has a Google account,
so it helps users signing up.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.410
So this is definitely
something you

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:53.730
don't want to miss.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.060
And the implementation
is very easy.

00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:01.240
So it shouldn't take more
action for a experienced

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.390
developer more than half a day
of implementing the Google+

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:07.770
implementation sign-up
on his application.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.000
Something no one wants
to miss, I believe.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.650
CHRIS CARTLAND: That's great.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:12.120
Great.

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.650
Well, thank you, so much,
for joining us.

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:18.330
It was great to talk to you
about your integration.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:21.110
And we hope that the success
that you seen, so far,

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.510
continues to make your app
grow and turn more of the

00:10:24.510 --> 00:10:27.360
people who see your app
into dedicated users.

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.530
LEFTERIS HARITOU: Thank
you for having me.

00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:29.540
CHRIS CARTLAND: Yeah,
thank you.

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:32.980
So we'll be back again, every
week, with Google+.

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:37.790
Check out the documentation at
developers.google.com/+.

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.780
If you have any questions about
how to integrate, you

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.510
can join us in our developer
community on Google+.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:47.550
Or you can ask questions
on "Stack Overflow"

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:49.470
with the tag Google+.

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:52.860
So please check out our samples,
and thank you so much

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.110
for watching.
