Here I've given you a right triangle and I told you two of the sides - 401.0 meters and 523.5 meters.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Now, I want to know, using this table of trig values and what you know about Trigonometric Ratios,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
can you tell me what is Î± and enter your answer in degrees.

00:00:20.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You don't need to enter the degrees. We'll assume they're there.
