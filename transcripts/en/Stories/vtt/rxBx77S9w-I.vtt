00:00:05.621 --> 00:00:07.495
LAURA LING: Why did you
join the Coast Guard?

00:00:07.495 --> 00:00:08.410
KORI CIOCA: Well,
I always knew I

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.565
was going to join the military
ever since I was a little kid.

00:00:10.565 --> 00:00:12.120
And I loved every minute of it.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.890
And it was like nobody was
male, nobody was female.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:16.700
We were a family.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:17.785
I'm very small, petite.

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:21.780
But there, I felt like I was
this Great Dane in a Chihuahua

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.280
body.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.330
I could do anything as long as
my teammates were next to me.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.030
LAURA LING: So things
seemed like they

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.920
were going very well for you.

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.910
And you had a great team.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.580
But you also had some very
traumatic situations happen

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.610
to you with your supervisor.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.115
What was going on?

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.400
KORI CIOCA: Well, he would
follow me around and call me

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.695
all sorts of names
that are inappropriate.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:48.340
And he gave me extra
duty all the time.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.816
But when other people would
try to stick up for me,

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.690
it seemed like he would
retaliate against me,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.110
but more if I went for help.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.750
He would drink on
duty, get drunk.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.900
And he'd unlock
my door at night.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.094
And it made me very
scared and frightened.

00:01:00.094 --> 00:01:01.760
And I would speak to
my command members.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.218
And they would say,
we're not going

00:01:03.218 --> 00:01:05.720
to move you just because you
don't like somebody, Cioca.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.840
So just go back out there.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.920
I couldn't understand why
it was happening to me.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.330
Why wasn't anyone doing
anything to help me?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.380
I didn't have a voice anymore.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.780
Everything just kept escalating.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.330
I mean, he would
spit in my face.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.080
And it was like he
was breaking me down.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.756
He pinned me down.

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:28.980
And anytime I would try
to say something-- help,

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.780
or please stop, please,
please-- he would hit me.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.710
But he'd hit me right in
my ear on the left side.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.315
And I shut up.

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:40.190
But this man did say he
was going to kill me.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.180
He did everything he said
he was going to do to me.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.665
Even did something-- he never
said he was going to rape me,

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:46.630
and he did.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.400
And that was the one I
wasn't expecting at all.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.630
That was the moment that
he knocked that Great Dane

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.590
right out of me.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.340
LAURA LING: Was it
from that point on that

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.520
you left the Coast Guard?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.840
What happened to
you at that point?

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.575
KORI CIOCA: I was getting
treatment for my injuries.

00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:05.540
And that's when
they gave me orders.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.830
And they discharged me.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.560
And he got 30 days restriction.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.170
He got bumped down in rank.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.610
And that's really
sad that, I mean,

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.140
this crime is just happening.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.910
And nobody's blinking
an eye at it.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.095
That's not the Coast
Guard that I joined.

00:02:23.095 --> 00:02:28.572
And at that point, I just
didn't want to be here anymore.

00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:29.655
I didn't want to be alive.

00:02:32.946 --> 00:02:34.820
LAURA LING: What were
some of the things that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.189
have helped you cope?

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:39.730
KORI CIOCA: It actually started
when I was getting treatment.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.130
So in my off time, I would
buy a disposable camera.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.790
And I would go and I would
take pictures of the lake.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:48.520
I met Rob.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.990
And I would take pictures
of Rob in the Coast Guard,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.150
him doing his job.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.330
I love taking pictures.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.144
It took away from what
was happening in my head.

00:02:58.144 --> 00:02:59.560
Now if I'm triggered
by something,

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.400
or if I have nightmares all
night, I grab my camera.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.360
And I focus on what's
important through that lens.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.080
So I'm thinking of all these
other things rather than

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.400
my trauma and my
trigger at the moment.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.910
It helps my brain switch gears.

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.860
I'll go out and I will
just walk somewhere.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.730
Abandoned places are
probably my most favorite.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.350
There's something so
beautiful about it.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.950
It really relates to
someone with PTSD.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.410
And a lot of people will look at
you and say, well, you look OK.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.150
You look put together.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.750
You look well.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.410
And they have no idea, because
PTSD is an invisible disorder.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.000
And if you were to take
a veteran with PTSD

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.810
and turn them inside
out, they would

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.440
be just like that abandoned
building-- broken windows.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.530
It's just beautiful
about the way

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.580
that it's still
standing after it's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.946
been forgotten and destroyed.

00:04:05.946 --> 00:04:08.320
LAURA LING: Do you feel like
you finally found your voice

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.389
through photography?

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:10.180
KORI CIOCA: I have.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.236
It helps me understand myself.

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:14.610
I can see at that time when
I took that picture, oh, it's

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.140
dark.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.919
I must've been
really sad that day.

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.089
Or was that a hard day.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:20.690
And there's one that's
really bright, and happy,

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:21.910
and beautiful.

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:24.690
That was a good day.

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.782
When I look through my
lens, I see my kids smiling.

00:04:27.782 --> 00:04:30.950
I see them happy.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.383
And it's like, I win.

00:04:33.383 --> 00:04:36.281

LAURA LING: Coming
up next, see how

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.250
swimming became the unlikely
ritual of a woman who nearly

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.534
lost her ability to walk.

00:04:46.534 --> 00:04:47.950
KIMBERLEY CHAMBERS:
My next memory

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.370
is waking up post-surgery,
30 minutes from amputation

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.300
from the knee down.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.730
I remember the surgeon
telling me, we saved your leg.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.240
But we don't know what, if any,
functionality you'll ever have.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.810
I told myself I was going
to prove them wrong.
