00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, we're just looking at these numbers, and the easiest equation to use for me

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
would be this oneâ€”Vy,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
even though the y isn't here in the original equation,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
remember I'm just looking at this right-hand side, equals

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
the initial velocity in the y direction, which was 0,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
plus the acceleration, which is 10.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Well, Vy just equals the initial velocity in the y direction, 0,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
plus 10 times 3.2--acceleration times time.

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Giving that out gives us 32 m/s.
