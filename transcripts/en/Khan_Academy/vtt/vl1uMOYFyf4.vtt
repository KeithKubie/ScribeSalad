00:00:00.101 --> 00:00:01.755
- [Voiceover] In a previous
video, we figured out how

00:00:01.755 --> 00:00:04.423
to find the surface
area of this cereal box

00:00:04.423 --> 00:00:07.475
by figuring out the areas
of each of the six surfaces

00:00:07.475 --> 00:00:09.320
of the box, and then adding them all up.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.300
I'm going to do that again in this video,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.831
but I'm going to do it by
visualizing a net for the box.

00:00:14.831 --> 00:00:16.647
The way I think about a net of a box

00:00:16.647 --> 00:00:18.730
like this, is what
would happen if you were

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.525
to cut the cardboard and
then flatten it all out?

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:23.664
So what am I talking about?

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:26.541
Well, what we have here, we could imagine

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:29.740
making a cut in the box,
and the cut could be,

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.464
let's see, I could make a cut back here,

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.387
So I could make a cut right over there,

00:00:35.387 --> 00:00:37.917
I could cut it...

00:00:37.917 --> 00:00:42.917
I could cut it right like
this, I could cut it like that.

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:45.820
So if I just did that, this top flap would

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.140
flap open so that would
be able to come out

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.827
like that, and then I could also

00:00:51.827 --> 00:00:55.502
make a cut for this side.

00:00:56.572 --> 00:00:58.161
So I could make a cut back there,

00:00:58.161 --> 00:01:03.008
and I could make a cut right over here,

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:06.367
and now this side could flap forward,

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:07.783
and I could do the same thing on

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:09.022
this other side right over here.

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:10.621
Then that could flap forward,

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:14.449
and then, the back side, I could draw it.

00:01:14.449 --> 00:01:16.276
So I would also have a cut.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:18.087
I'll draw it as a dotted line because

00:01:18.087 --> 00:01:20.457
you're not supposed to
be able to see this cut.

00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.410
But the corresponding cut to this one

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.054
on the side that we can't see,

00:01:24.054 --> 00:01:25.965
we can draw it a little
bit neater than that.

00:01:25.965 --> 00:01:28.527
The corresponding cut
would be right back here.

00:01:30.007 --> 00:01:32.437
Right back there, and then
a cut right over here.

00:01:32.437 --> 00:01:33.740
And so what would happen

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.375
if we were to flatten all of this out?

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:36.533
Well we would have,

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.796
we would have the front of the box.

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:40.624
I'll try to draw this as neatly as I can.

00:01:40.624 --> 00:01:43.508
So the front of the box looks like this.

00:01:43.508 --> 00:01:48.171
We would have this top
flap, which looks like this

00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:51.101
If we were to flatten it all out.

00:01:51.101 --> 00:01:52.355
We have these two side flaps.

00:01:52.355 --> 00:01:54.048
So that's a side flap.

00:01:54.048 --> 00:01:56.440
That's a slide flap.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.499
And this is another, this
side flap right over here.

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:00.820
That's a side flap.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.621
Then we would have the bottom of the box.

00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:07.063
So the bottom of the box
is going to look like this.

00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:09.340
The bottom of the box.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.095
And then we have the back of the box.

00:02:11.095 --> 00:02:12.644
That the bottom is going
to be connected to.

00:02:12.644 --> 00:02:14.279
We didn't cut that.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.722
So we have the back of the box.

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:19.627
The back of the box looks like this.

00:02:19.627 --> 00:02:20.951
And there we have it.

00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.059
We've made the net.

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.776
This is what would happen if you

00:02:22.776 --> 00:02:24.378
made the cuts that I talked about

00:02:24.378 --> 00:02:26.654
and then flatten the box
out, it would look like this.

00:02:26.654 --> 00:02:29.854
Now how can we use this net
to find the surface area?

00:02:29.854 --> 00:02:31.528
Well we just need to figure out

00:02:31.528 --> 00:02:34.523
the surface area of this shape now.

00:02:34.523 --> 00:02:35.552
So how do we do that?

00:02:35.552 --> 00:02:37.422
Well we know a lot about the dimensions.

00:02:37.422 --> 00:02:39.887
We know that this width right over here,

00:02:39.887 --> 00:02:41.450
that this is ten centimeters.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.264
Ten centimeters from there to there.

00:02:45.264 --> 00:02:48.056
We know the height, actually,

00:02:48.056 --> 00:02:50.482
going all the way from
here all the way up.

00:02:50.482 --> 00:02:52.605
Because the height of the
box is 20 centimeters,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:57.067
so this is going to be 20
centimeters right over here.

00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:59.341
And you have another 20 centimeters,

00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:03.175
you have another 20
centimeters right over here.

00:03:03.175 --> 00:03:06.251
And right over here if you like.

00:03:06.251 --> 00:03:08.761
And then you have, see
the depth of the box

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:10.984
is three centimeters, so
this is three centimeters.

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:15.915
Three centimeters, and then
this is three centimeters.

00:03:15.915 --> 00:03:18.006
And so what is the area,

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.926
actually just let me do one region first.

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:22.626
What is the area of this entire region

00:03:22.626 --> 00:03:27.045
that I am shading in with this blue color?

00:03:27.045 --> 00:03:30.285
Well it's ten centimeters, that is,

00:03:30.285 --> 00:03:32.833
I'll do a color that you
can see a bit more easily.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:37.342
It is ten centimeters
wide, ten centimeters.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:39.538
Times, what's the height?

00:03:39.538 --> 00:03:43.948
20, plus three, plus 20, plus three.

00:03:43.948 --> 00:03:48.948
So that's going to be 40 plus
six, so times 46 centimeters.

00:03:49.056 --> 00:03:50.747
That's this blue area.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:55.352
So that's going to be 460,
460 square centimeters.

00:03:55.352 --> 00:03:57.907
460 square centimeters, and now we just

00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:00.369
have to figure out the
area of the two flaps.

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:02.267
So this flap right over here

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:05.139
is 20 centimeters by three centimeters.

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.704
So that's 60 centimeters squared.

00:04:07.704 --> 00:04:11.334
So 60 centimeters squared,

00:04:11.334 --> 00:04:13.307
or 60 square centimeters I should say.

00:04:13.307 --> 00:04:16.046
And then this flap is going
to have the exact same area.

00:04:16.046 --> 00:04:17.656
Another 60 square centimeters.

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:21.408
60 square centimeters, and
you add everything together.

00:04:21.408 --> 00:04:23.232
We deserve a little bit of a drumroll.

00:04:23.232 --> 00:04:25.671
We get, well this is going to add up to

00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:29.127
580 square centimeters.

00:04:29.127 --> 00:04:30.950
Which is the exact thing
we got in the other video

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.804
where we didn't use a
net, and you should just,

00:04:32.804 --> 00:04:34.529
it's nice to be able to do it either way.

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:35.797
To be able to visualize the net

00:04:35.797 --> 00:04:37.570
or to be able to look
at this and think about

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.094
the different sides, even the sides that

00:04:39.094 --> 00:04:41.361
you might not necessarily see.
