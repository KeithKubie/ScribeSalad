my response to that the first is I'm
 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.930
my response to that the first is I'm
generating almost all of my content and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940
generating almost all of my content and
 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.850
generating almost all of my content and
making it completely publicly accessible

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
making it completely publicly accessible
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.030
making it completely publicly accessible
so it's free right and and so that way

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040
so it's free right and and so that way
 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.479
so it's free right and and so that way
I'm bringing I think awareness of

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489
I'm bringing I think awareness of
 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.010
I'm bringing I think awareness of
psychological issues to a very large

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020
psychological issues to a very large
 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.049
psychological issues to a very large
number of people and so far at the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
number of people and so far at the
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.060
number of people and so far at the
moment my view count on YouTube is up to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
moment my view count on YouTube is up to
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.119
moment my view count on YouTube is up to
13 million and I did a little bit of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
13 million and I did a little bit of
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.889
13 million and I did a little bit of
calculations last week to try to figure

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899
calculations last week to try to figure
 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.180
calculations last week to try to figure
out what the total view count was for

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
out what the total view count was for
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.610
out what the total view count was for
the cuts of my lectures that have been

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620
the cuts of my lectures that have been
 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.229
the cuts of my lectures that have been
appearing on YouTube and then the

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239
appearing on YouTube and then the
 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.880
appearing on YouTube and then the
political material as well and I think

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
political material as well and I think
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340
political material as well and I think
it's upward of 50 million and so I'm

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
it's upward of 50 million and so I'm
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840
it's upward of 50 million and so I'm
making psychological and political

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850
making psychological and political
 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.000
making psychological and political
content available to 50 million people

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
content available to 50 million people
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.190
content available to 50 million people
and so you know that seems like a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
and so you know that seems like a
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.249
and so you know that seems like a
reasonable thing to do now people who

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
reasonable thing to do now people who
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.600
reasonable thing to do now people who
don't agree with what I'm saying might

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610
don't agree with what I'm saying might
 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.280
don't agree with what I'm saying might
differ but I think that could be

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290
differ but I think that could be
 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.289
differ but I think that could be
separated from the educational content

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
separated from the educational content
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.140
separated from the educational content
as well so and then with regards to the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
as well so and then with regards to the
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.080
as well so and then with regards to the
patreon subscribers every single person

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090
patreon subscribers every single person
 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.460
patreon subscribers every single person
who's doing that is doing it entirely

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
who's doing that is doing it entirely
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.410
who's doing that is doing it entirely
voluntarily and I also set up that

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
voluntarily and I also set up that
 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.240
voluntarily and I also set up that

patreon account long before any of this
political material emerged so and my

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270
political material emerged so and my
 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.780
political material emerged so and my
sense with the patreon viewers and you

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790
sense with the patreon viewers and you
 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.130
sense with the patreon viewers and you
guys can clue me in if I'm wrong about

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
guys can clue me in if I'm wrong about
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.780
guys can clue me in if I'm wrong about
this is that there's two things

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790
this is that there's two things
 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.870
this is that there's two things
happening as one is it enables people

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880
happening as one is it enables people
 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.520
happening as one is it enables people
who are not very happy about the current

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530
who are not very happy about the current
 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.050
who are not very happy about the current
political situation in the West to to to

political situation in the West to to to
 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.139
political situation in the West to to to
contribute to something that might be at

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149
contribute to something that might be at
 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.139
contribute to something that might be at
least to some degree attempting to stem

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
least to some degree attempting to stem
 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.999
least to some degree attempting to stem
the tide of such things as toxic

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
the tide of such things as toxic
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.240
the tide of such things as toxic
political correctness and second that it

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250
political correctness and second that it
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.969
political correctness and second that it
enables people to support my endeavors

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
enables people to support my endeavors
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.490
enables people to support my endeavors
to bring general education to a wider

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
to bring general education to a wider
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.529
to bring general education to a wider
audience and that seems like a good deal

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539
audience and that seems like a good deal
 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.330
audience and that seems like a good deal
for everyone and you know you might say

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340
for everyone and you know you might say
 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.949
for everyone and you know you might say
well it's a particularly good deal for

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959
well it's a particularly good deal for
 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.460
well it's a particularly good deal for
me and

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470
me and
 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.110
me and
I'm certainly not complaining about

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
I'm certainly not complaining about
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.730
I'm certainly not complaining about
what's happening but I would also point

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
what's happening but I would also point
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.120
what's happening but I would also point
out that it hasn't exactly been a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130
out that it hasn't exactly been a
 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:28.310
out that it hasn't exactly been a
straightforward thing and so so I guess

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320
straightforward thing and so so I guess
 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.750
straightforward thing and so so I guess
if anyone else wants to try it they're

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760
if anyone else wants to try it they're
 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.700
if anyone else wants to try it they're
more than welcome to now having said

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710
more than welcome to now having said
 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.930
more than welcome to now having said
that I would also say that the real

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
that I would also say that the real
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.540
that I would also say that the real
issue here and I think this is the fact

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550
issue here and I think this is the fact
 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.310
issue here and I think this is the fact
that this isn't self-evident is also a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320
that this isn't self-evident is also a
 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.620
that this isn't self-evident is also a
commentary on the toxicity of our

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
commentary on the toxicity of our
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.270
commentary on the toxicity of our
culture at the moment is that it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280
culture at the moment is that it
 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.130
culture at the moment is that it
actually isn't the issue the issue isn't

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140
actually isn't the issue the issue isn't
 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.550
actually isn't the issue the issue isn't
really how much money you have I think

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.199
really how much money you have I think
that that's a resentful and and

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
that that's a resentful and and
 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.540
that that's a resentful and and
relatively vicious way of judging

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550
relatively vicious way of judging
 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.150
relatively vicious way of judging
someone else I think the issue is what

someone else I think the issue is what
 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.530
someone else I think the issue is what

thinner because for 12 lectures that was
a $60,000 investment about that

a $60,000 investment about that

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760
$8,000 for that for the camera work and
 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.750
$8,000 for that for the camera work and
that had to be basically dealt with

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760
that had to be basically dealt with
 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.430
that had to be basically dealt with
upfront so it was a reasonable financial

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440
upfront so it was a reasonable financial
 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.539
upfront so it was a reasonable financial
risk now I've been crazily fortunate in

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549
risk now I've been crazily fortunate in
 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.060
risk now I've been crazily fortunate in
that theater tickets have also sold out

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.650
over and so you know I'm pretty happy
about that because that gives me some

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660
about that because that gives me some

right now about trying to do that in a
 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.300
right now about trying to do that in a
more formal sense so that the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310
more formal sense so that the

accessible and one of the things we're
 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.130
accessible and one of the things we're
trying to crack is the problem of how to

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140
trying to crack is the problem of how to
 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.720
trying to crack is the problem of how to
teach people to write because that's a

430 if you look carefully there you'll
 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.850
430 if you look carefully there you'll
see that there's an essay rubric the

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860
see that there's an essay rubric the
 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.560

so if you're interested in how to learn
 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.020
so if you're interested in how to learn
to write I've written something about

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030
to write I've written something about
 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.280
to write I've written something about
that already and we're going to make a

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290
that already and we're going to make a
 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.600
that already and we're going to make a
piece of software that's going to help

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610
piece of software that's going to help
 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.540

people learn to write and so I've got
plans for how to make writing education

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100
plans for how to make writing education
 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.520
plans for how to make writing education
broadly accessible to people so I would

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530
broadly accessible to people so I would
 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.590
broadly accessible to people so I would
like to make humanities education of the

is going to be going to projects exactly
like that and the reason for that is

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750
like that and the reason for that is
 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.630
like that and the reason for that is
that what the hell else would I do with

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:22.890
factories produce batteries like mad so
 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:26.570
factories produce batteries like mad so
that we can start to make alternative

energy sources economically viable and
 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.980
energy sources economically viable and
maybe reduce our dependence on oil and

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990
maybe reduce our dependence on oil and
 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.630
maybe reduce our dependence on oil and
maybe get ourselves out from underneath

be a good thing so the monetary issue

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680
be a good thing so the monetary issue
 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.740
be a good thing so the monetary issue
it's quite interesting it's like it is

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:39.750
it's quite interesting it's like it is
 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.530
it's quite interesting it's like it is
not that

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540
not that
 

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.730
not that
have the money it's what you do with it

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740
have the money it's what you do with it
 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.950
have the money it's what you do with it
so anyways those are some of my plans

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960
so anyways those are some of my plans
 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.870
so anyways those are some of my plans
and that isn't all of them because I'm

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880
and that isn't all of them because I'm
 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.640
and that isn't all of them because I'm
going to come up with a bunch more plans

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650
going to come up with a bunch more plans
 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.110
going to come up with a bunch more plans
and I'm going to try to implement them

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120
and I'm going to try to implement them
 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:50.820
and I'm going to try to implement them
as rapidly as I possibly can

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:50.830
as rapidly as I possibly can
 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.240
as rapidly as I possibly can
I've put my clinical practice on hiatus

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250
I've put my clinical practice on hiatus
 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.770
I've put my clinical practice on hiatus
for the next three months so that I have

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:55.780
for the next three months so that I have
 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.660
for the next three months so that I have
a chance to think and I've requested

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:57.670
a chance to think and I've requested
 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.490
a chance to think and I've requested
that the University advanced by

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500
that the University advanced by
 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.410
that the University advanced by
sabbatical by one year so I should have

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.420
sabbatical by one year so I should have
 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.450
sabbatical by one year so I should have
about a year to think about what I

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:03.460
about a year to think about what I
 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.730
about a year to think about what I
should be doing with YouTube and how I

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:05.740
should be doing with YouTube and how I
 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.250
should be doing with YouTube and how I
can be promoting broad-scale public

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260
can be promoting broad-scale public
 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.930
can be promoting broad-scale public
education of the highest quality and

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940
education of the highest quality and
 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.090
education of the highest quality and
that's a really fun problem to solve and

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100
that's a really fun problem to solve and
 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.310
that's a really fun problem to solve and
the fact that I'm being supported by all

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:14.320
the fact that I'm being supported by all
 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.170
the fact that I'm being supported by all
of you people on patreon makes the

00:07:16.170 --> 00:07:16.180
of you people on patreon makes the
 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.720
of you people on patreon makes the
probability develop - that I'll be able

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730
probability develop - that I'll be able
 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.940
probability develop - that I'll be able
to devote my time to that much higher so

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950
to devote my time to that much higher so
 

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.930
to devote my time to that much higher so
so that's what I'm going to do with it

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940
so that's what I'm going to do with it
 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.430
so that's what I'm going to do with it
I'm going to do the best things I can

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:26.440
I'm going to do the best things I can
 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:29.000
I'm going to do the best things I can
possibly think of to do with it and

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010
possibly think of to do with it and
 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.860
possibly think of to do with it and
hopefully that'll work and so far it

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:31.870
hopefully that'll work and so far it
 

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:36.270
hopefully that'll work and so far it
seems to be going well so yeah I mean

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280
seems to be going well so yeah I mean
 

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.550
seems to be going well so yeah I mean
I've been taken aback quite a bit by the

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560
I've been taken aback quite a bit by the
 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.650
I've been taken aback quite a bit by the
I mean it's not surprising that you know

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:40.660
I mean it's not surprising that you know
 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:42.180
I mean it's not surprising that you know
the people who've been trying to take me

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.190
the people who've been trying to take me
 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.580
the people who've been trying to take me
down let's say or squawking and bitching

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:44.590
down let's say or squawking and bitching
 

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.860
down let's say or squawking and bitching
because I happen to be generating a

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:46.870
because I happen to be generating a
 

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.780
because I happen to be generating a
fairly reasonable income from this

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:48.790
fairly reasonable income from this
 

00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:50.430
fairly reasonable income from this
although I don't think about it as an

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:50.440
although I don't think about it as an
 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.050
although I don't think about it as an
income as I already said I think about

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.060
income as I already said I think about
 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.960
income as I already said I think about
it as a as a toolkit for pursuing more

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:54.970
it as a as a toolkit for pursuing more
 

00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.570
it as a as a toolkit for pursuing more
interesting things it's like if that's

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:57.580
interesting things it's like if that's
 

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:59.190
interesting things it's like if that's
the best they can do with regards to

00:07:59.190 --> 00:07:59.200
the best they can do with regards to
 

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.260
the best they can do with regards to
continuing to tarnish my name well then

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:01.270
continuing to tarnish my name well then
 

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.240
continuing to tarnish my name well then
let them let them go right ahead about

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:03.250
let them let them go right ahead about
 

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.900
let them let them go right ahead about
that and I think the proof is in the

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:06.910
that and I think the proof is in the
 

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.390
that and I think the proof is in the
outcome and like the biblical series and

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:09.400
outcome and like the biblical series and
 

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:11.010
outcome and like the biblical series and
that's a direct consequence of the

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:11.020
that's a direct consequence of the
 

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:12.540
that's a direct consequence of the
patreon support that seems to be going

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:12.550
patreon support that seems to be going
 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.300
patreon support that seems to be going

many people would be interested in what
 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.740
many people would be interested in what
I consider the fundamental foundation

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:28.750
I consider the fundamental foundation
 

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.930
I consider the fundamental foundation
for any true humanities education so

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:30.940
for any true humanities education so
 

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:32.670
for any true humanities education so
great we'll build from there and so

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:32.680
great we'll build from there and so
 

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.740
great we'll build from there and so
that's that's what I'm going to do with

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:34.750
that's that's what I'm going to do with
 

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.219
that's that's what I'm going to do with
the money so if people don't like that

the money so if people don't like that
then they don't have to donate or they

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.030
then they don't have to donate or they
 

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.089
then they don't have to donate or they
don't have to subscribe it's hardly like

00:08:42.089 --> 00:08:42.099
don't have to subscribe it's hardly like
 

00:08:42.099 --> 00:08:44.700
don't have to subscribe it's hardly like
