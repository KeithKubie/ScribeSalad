00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:09.106
&gt;&gt; Dude: Grrr!

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:11.586
Something is really wrong with this!

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:12.916
&gt;&gt; Sally: What are you playing with?

00:00:12.916 --> 00:00:15.126
&gt;&gt; Dude: I downloaded an
app called "Part Palette."

00:00:15.126 --> 00:00:18.406
It lets me plan genetic circuits
using Parts from the Registry.

00:00:18.526 --> 00:00:19.476
&gt;&gt; Sally: That sounds great.

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:19.996
Can I see?

00:00:19.996 --> 00:00:22.926
&gt;&gt; Dude: I can select parts and then
wrap them together on the palette.

00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:24.866
Or at least I'm suppose to be able to do that!
11
00:00:24,866 --&gt; 00:00:24,356
I keep getting an error message.

00:00:24.406 --> 00:00:24.856
&gt;&gt; Sally: Hmmm...

00:00:24.976 --> 00:00:29.326
maybe the app doesn't work,
or maybe there's something

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:31.126
about the parts you're trying to wrap together.

00:00:31.436 --> 00:00:32.796
What gene are you trying to build?

00:00:32.796 --> 00:00:34.406
&gt;&gt; Dude: I just grabbed these 3 parts to try.

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:38.076
&gt;&gt; Sally: A terminator, an
operator and an open reading frame?

00:00:38.076 --> 00:00:39.366
That's not a gene...

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.616
&gt;&gt; Dude: but it's got an open
reading frame...what more do I need?

00:00:42.616 --> 00:00:43.476
&gt;&gt; Sally: Walk with me Dude.

00:00:43.596 --> 00:00:45.356
For starters you'll need a promoter.

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:50.766
That's a snippet of DNA that the RNA polymerase
binds to when it starts transcription.

00:00:51.146 --> 00:00:54.046
Promoters come in different
strengths so choose carefully.

00:00:54.046 --> 00:00:56.446
&gt;&gt; Dude: How do I know if a
promoter is strong or weak?

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:59.446
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well the strongest
promoters have this DNA sequence.

00:00:59.526 --> 00:01:02.046
RNA polymerase can bind these bases well.

00:01:02.046 --> 00:01:06.606
The more bases that are different from this
consensus sequence, the weaker the promoter is

00:01:06.606 --> 00:01:11.576
since RNA polymerase will bind less well
and transcribe less often...at least...

00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:13.286
that's how it usually works.

00:01:13.286 --> 00:01:13.376
&gt;&gt; Dude: oh no!

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.386
I hear an exception coming...

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:17.606
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well sure Dude...it's
very clever really.

00:01:17.876 --> 00:01:20.816
There are promoters that are used
in different stages of cell growth

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:23.816
and those promoters bind a
slightly different RNA polymerase

00:01:23.816 --> 00:01:26.816
so they have a consensus sequence
that's a little different from this one.

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:30.036
And then there are still other
promoters that have lots of differences

00:01:30.036 --> 00:01:33.086
from this consensus sequence but
they are still strong promoters

00:01:33.086 --> 00:01:37.096
since they also have DNA sequences
nearby that bind activating proteins.

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:40.186
The activators help RNA polymerase
find the promoter

00:01:40.226 --> 00:01:42.246
and that gets transcription really cranking.

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:44.366
Activated promoters can be very strong.

00:01:44.426 --> 00:01:45.866
&gt;&gt; Dude: When does it end!?!

00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:48.996
&gt;&gt; Sally: Another great question
Dude!...there are sequences that come

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:51.076
after the open reading frame called terminators.

00:01:51.186 --> 00:01:55.346
These tell RNA polymerase to stop
transcribing RNA and to leave the DNA.

00:01:55.346 --> 00:01:59.956
These terminators are really useful if you
have another promoter downstream of this gene.

00:02:00.296 --> 00:02:02.986
You'll need a terminator if you
don't want the polymerase to read

00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:05.166
through this gene into the next one downstream.

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:06.226
&gt;&gt; Dude: "Downstream?"

00:02:06.466 --> 00:02:08.515
Don't you mean "on the right?"

00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:10.826
&gt;&gt; Sally: Cells don't know their
right from their left so we have

00:02:10.826 --> 00:02:14.566
to use the natural polarity of double
stranded DNA when we give directions.

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:18.776
"Downstream" means "more 3-prime" no matter
which strand of the DNA you're working on.

00:02:18.776 --> 00:02:22.056
&gt;&gt; Dude: So in this app I can wrap any promoter,

00:02:22.056 --> 00:02:26.806
ORF and terminator together,
and I've got a gene!

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:28.816
&gt;&gt; Sally: Well actually you've
got a transcription unit,

00:02:28.816 --> 00:02:32.746
and most of the time you'll want to translate
the RNA from that unit into a protein.

00:02:32.746 --> 00:02:36.156
To translate it, you'll need to
include a ribosome binding site.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:39.076
The RBS is where ribosomes
attach to the RNA message

00:02:39.136 --> 00:02:42.686
so they can start linking the specified
amino acids into a protein chain.

00:02:42.686 --> 00:02:47.526
And you can control the strength of the RBS to
control how much of the message gets translated.

00:02:47.696 --> 00:02:48.576
&gt;&gt; Dude: and I'll bet there's
an app for that too...

00:02:48.886 --> 00:02:51.836
&gt;&gt; Sally: well if you're
interested in working on one,

00:02:52.076 --> 00:02:56.366
let me tell you about how genes are arranged in
eukaryotic cells like plants, yeast and human...

00:02:56.366 --> 00:02:57.946
&gt;&gt; Dude: Can we do that another day Sally?

00:02:58.096 --> 00:02:59.996
My disk space nearly full.
