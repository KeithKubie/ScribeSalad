today's episode we're going to talk

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470
today's episode we're going to talk
 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.990
today's episode we're going to talk
about ten more navigation anti-patterns

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000
about ten more navigation anti-patterns
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.640
about ten more navigation anti-patterns
and when we say ten more each other

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650
and when we say ten more each other
 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.290
and when we say ten more each other
because we actually recorded a previous

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300
because we actually recorded a previous
 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.859
because we actually recorded a previous
episode of the show where we went into

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869
episode of the show where we went into
 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.349
episode of the show where we went into
ten of the most common UX issues user

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359
ten of the most common UX issues user
 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.600
ten of the most common UX issues user
experience issues that we saw and some

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610
experience issues that we saw and some
 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.060
experience issues that we saw and some
of those issues were specifically

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070
of those issues were specifically
 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.190
of those issues were specifically
related to navigation so in this episode

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
related to navigation so in this episode
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.010
related to navigation so in this episode
we'll talk about ten more navigation

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020
we'll talk about ten more navigation
 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.350
we'll talk about ten more navigation
anti-patterns that we've since kind of

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360
anti-patterns that we've since kind of
 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.000
anti-patterns that we've since kind of
thought about I guess since that episode

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010
thought about I guess since that episode
 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.200
thought about I guess since that episode
if you want to kind of talk a little bit

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
if you want to kind of talk a little bit
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.690
if you want to kind of talk a little bit
more about the background here yes Ari

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700
more about the background here yes Ari
 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.400
more about the background here yes Ari
of course and if you didn't catch a

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410
of course and if you didn't catch a
 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.310
of course and if you didn't catch a
previous episode and we kind of went the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320
previous episode and we kind of went the
 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.600
previous episode and we kind of went the
background that part of our job is to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610
background that part of our job is to
 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.459
background that part of our job is to
work the bunch of planners and look at

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
work the bunch of planners and look at
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.680
work the bunch of planners and look at
all kinds of applications out there and

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
all kinds of applications out there and
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.460
all kinds of applications out there and
can we come across all kinds of issues

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
can we come across all kinds of issues
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.580
can we come across all kinds of issues
and variations on the patterns some of

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
and variations on the patterns some of
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.920
and variations on the patterns some of
which works on which day one of the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930
which works on which day one of the
 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.480
which works on which day one of the
things we often see is when people are

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490
things we often see is when people are
 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.880
things we often see is when people are
new to Android design they quickly think

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890
new to Android design they quickly think
 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.499
new to Android design they quickly think
of things like the visual language or

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
of things like the visual language or
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.670
of things like the visual language or
unquote but they sometimes don't

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
unquote but they sometimes don't
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.350
unquote but they sometimes don't
completely internalize the navigation

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
completely internalize the navigation
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.620
completely internalize the navigation
patterns and completely and grasp the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
patterns and completely and grasp the
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.730
patterns and completely and grasp the
nuances of some of the consequences and

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740
nuances of some of the consequences and
 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.160
nuances of some of the consequences and
of tv18 from these plans so we wanted to

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
of tv18 from these plans so we wanted to
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.890
of tv18 from these plans so we wanted to
give you a benefit of both experience

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900
give you a benefit of both experience
 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.660
give you a benefit of both experience
and highlight some of the pitfalls we've

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670
and highlight some of the pitfalls we've
 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.179
and highlight some of the pitfalls we've
come across and we should watch out for

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189
come across and we should watch out for
 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.880
come across and we should watch out for
and what you can do instead exactly

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890
and what you can do instead exactly
 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.130
and what you can do instead exactly
alright without further ado let's get

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140
alright without further ado let's get
 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.120
alright without further ado let's get
started okay so ten more navigation

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130
started okay so ten more navigation
 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.639
started okay so ten more navigation
anti-patterns the first that we're going

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649
anti-patterns the first that we're going
 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.069
anti-patterns the first that we're going
to talk about is navigation in the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079
to talk about is navigation in the
 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.609
to talk about is navigation in the
action bar overflow so this is getting

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619
action bar overflow so this is getting
 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.050
action bar overflow so this is getting
to be less and less common which is

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060
to be less and less common which is
 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300
to be less and less common which is
great but the idea here is that you know

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310
great but the idea here is that you know
 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219
great but the idea here is that you know
some of the apps that we've seen have

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
some of the apps that we've seen have
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.230
some of the apps that we've seen have
put their primary navigation so for

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240
put their primary navigation so for
 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.359
put their primary navigation so for
example home you know store my items you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369
example home you know store my items you
 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.429
example home you know store my items you
know different categories browse things

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439
know different categories browse things
 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.020
know different categories browse things
like that basically kind of like the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
like that basically kind of like the
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.910
like that basically kind of like the
core way to navigate your app they've

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920
core way to navigate your app they've
 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.350
core way to navigate your app they've
put this all into the action bar

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360
put this all into the action bar
 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.640
put this all into the action bar
overflow and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
overflow and
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.050
overflow and
is really kind of the wrong place to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060
is really kind of the wrong place to
 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.750
is really kind of the wrong place to
place to put your navigation their

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760
place to put your navigation their
 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.220
place to put your navigation their
number of reasons for this I mean the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
number of reasons for this I mean the
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110
number of reasons for this I mean the
most common I guess the the major reason

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120
most common I guess the the major reason
 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.110
most common I guess the the major reason
is that now most apps don't do this most

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120
is that now most apps don't do this most
 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.410
is that now most apps don't do this most
apps follow the guidelines and use more

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420
apps follow the guidelines and use more
 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.569
apps follow the guidelines and use more
standard UI patterns for exposing their

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579
standard UI patterns for exposing their
 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:30.830
standard UI patterns for exposing their
top-level navigation

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
top-level navigation
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.690
top-level navigation
well obviously talk about those things

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700
well obviously talk about those things
 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.089
well obviously talk about those things
like the navigation drawer things like

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
like the navigation drawer things like
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.729
like the navigation drawer things like
tabs really this is the wrong place to

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739
tabs really this is the wrong place to
 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.929
tabs really this is the wrong place to
put it

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:38.939
put it
 

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:41.210
put it
another reason is actually on older

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
another reason is actually on older
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.160
another reason is actually on older
devices that don't have the action bar

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170
devices that don't have the action bar
 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.470
devices that don't have the action bar
overflow it would be hidden under the

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
overflow it would be hidden under the
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.240
overflow it would be hidden under the
menu button and there are lots of issues

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250
menu button and there are lots of issues
 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.099
menu button and there are lots of issues
with with the menu button the hardware

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109
with with the menu button the hardware
 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:50.809
with with the menu button the hardware
menu button we won't get into all of

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819
menu button we won't get into all of
 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.399
menu button we won't get into all of
them today but this is definitely one of

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409
them today but this is definitely one of
 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.860
them today but this is definitely one of
the kind of the aunt one of the

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870
the kind of the aunt one of the
 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.509
the kind of the aunt one of the
navigation anti-patterns that we thought

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519
navigation anti-patterns that we thought
 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.059
navigation anti-patterns that we thought
was pretty common but you know luckily

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069
was pretty common but you know luckily
 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.670
was pretty common but you know luckily
it's getting less and less common

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
it's getting less and less common
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.679
it's getting less and less common
yeah Jerry it kind of goes against the

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689
yeah Jerry it kind of goes against the
 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:05.569
yeah Jerry it kind of goes against the
organization had a navigation on the

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
organization had a navigation on the
 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.149
organization had a navigation on the
left and actions on the right and all

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159
left and actions on the right and all
 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.470
left and actions on the right and all
the other apps on the platform and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
the other apps on the platform and
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.110
the other apps on the platform and
training uses look for so you know users

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120
training uses look for so you know users
 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.170
training uses look for so you know users
not finding sense actually apps and you

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180
not finding sense actually apps and you
 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.789
not finding sense actually apps and you
know if you fight is bad it could be

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799
know if you fight is bad it could be
 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.080
know if you fight is bad it could be
that you know they're just looking for

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090
that you know they're just looking for
 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.170
that you know they're just looking for
it elsewhere

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180
it elsewhere
 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.300
it elsewhere
so the second navigation anti-pattern

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310
so the second navigation anti-pattern
 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.879
so the second navigation anti-pattern
that we want to talk about today is

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889
that we want to talk about today is
 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.159
that we want to talk about today is
using UI patterns in the wrong order or

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169
using UI patterns in the wrong order or
 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.990
using UI patterns in the wrong order or
kind of having the wrong navigational

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000
kind of having the wrong navigational
 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.390
kind of having the wrong navigational
hierarchy so you know we have a couple

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400
hierarchy so you know we have a couple
 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.000
hierarchy so you know we have a couple
of you know major UI patterns for

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
of you know major UI patterns for
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.349
of you know major UI patterns for
exposing navigation things like the

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:38.359
exposing navigation things like the
 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.990
exposing navigation things like the
navigation drawer the action bar spinner

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000
navigation drawer the action bar spinner
 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.080
navigation drawer the action bar spinner
and tabs action bar tabs or just regular

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090
and tabs action bar tabs or just regular
 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.199
and tabs action bar tabs or just regular
tabs so there's actually a pretty strict

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209
tabs so there's actually a pretty strict
 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.059
tabs so there's actually a pretty strict
ordering with how you should use these

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069
ordering with how you should use these
 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.640
ordering with how you should use these
in which order you should use them and

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650
in which order you should use them and
 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.319
in which order you should use them and
you know basically when you look at your

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329
you know basically when you look at your
 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:55.789
you know basically when you look at your
app in terms of its informational

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799
app in terms of its informational
 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.800
app in terms of its informational
hierarchy you'll you'll generally create

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810
hierarchy you'll you'll generally create
 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.719
hierarchy you'll you'll generally create
something like a tree right so the top

00:03:59.719 --> 00:03:59.729
something like a tree right so the top
 

00:03:59.729 --> 00:04:01.430
something like a tree right so the top
you'll have home at the second level

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440
you'll have home at the second level
 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.649
you'll have home at the second level
you'll have your major sections and then

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659
you'll have your major sections and then
 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.030
you'll have your major sections and then
with each section you may have

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
with each section you may have
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.360
with each section you may have
subsections and subsections and so on so

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370
subsections and subsections and so on so
 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.379
subsections and subsections and so on so
one of the things that we've actually

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:09.389
one of the things that we've actually
 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.580
one of the things that we've actually
seen a handful of apps do is use these

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590
seen a handful of apps do is use these
 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.680
seen a handful of apps do is use these
different UI patterns to represent

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690
different UI patterns to represent
 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.420
different UI patterns to represent
different levels of that information

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430
different levels of that information
 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.909
different levels of that information
hierarchy now the wrong thing to do

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919
hierarchy now the wrong thing to do
 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.450
hierarchy now the wrong thing to do
would be to use say tabs to represent

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460
would be to use say tabs to represent
 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.909
would be to use say tabs to represent
the the top level and then the action

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919
the the top level and then the action
 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.379
the the top level and then the action
bar spinner to represent say

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389
bar spinner to represent say
 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.749
bar spinner to represent say
the next level and then for example the

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759
the next level and then for example the
 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:31.670
the next level and then for example the
navigation drawer to represent the third

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680
navigation drawer to represent the third
 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.010
navigation drawer to represent the third
or deepest level so this is actually

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020
or deepest level so this is actually
 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.170
or deepest level so this is actually
just kind of the wrong way to do it on

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180
just kind of the wrong way to do it on
 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.469
just kind of the wrong way to do it on
Android these three UI patterns actually

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479
Android these three UI patterns actually
 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:42.469
Android these three UI patterns actually
follow a pretty rigid level or pretty

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479
follow a pretty rigid level or pretty
 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.010
follow a pretty rigid level or pretty
rigid hierarchy so instead of doing

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020
rigid hierarchy so instead of doing
 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:47.719
rigid hierarchy so instead of doing
something like this the correct

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729
something like this the correct
 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.239
something like this the correct
hierarchy would actually be to always

00:04:50.239 --> 00:04:50.249
hierarchy would actually be to always
 

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:52.730
hierarchy would actually be to always
have the navigation drawer represent the

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740
have the navigation drawer represent the
 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.890
have the navigation drawer represent the
topmost level of your application

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900
topmost level of your application
 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.140
topmost level of your application
hierarchy and then you know if you have

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
hierarchy and then you know if you have
 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.149
hierarchy and then you know if you have
an action bar spinner that should be the

00:04:59.149 --> 00:04:59.159
an action bar spinner that should be the
 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.129
an action bar spinner that should be the
second level and finally if you have

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139
second level and finally if you have
 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.019
second level and finally if you have
tabs it should be a third level now if

00:05:03.019 --> 00:05:03.029
tabs it should be a third level now if
 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.279
tabs it should be a third level now if
you don't have a spinner if you just

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289
you don't have a spinner if you just
 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.330
you don't have a spinner if you just
have a navigation drawer and tabs such

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340
have a navigation drawer and tabs such
 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.369
have a navigation drawer and tabs such
as with Google Play Music then it would

00:05:10.369 --> 00:05:10.379
as with Google Play Music then it would
 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.320
as with Google Play Music then it would
just be the navigation drawer and then

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330
just be the navigation drawer and then
 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.450
just be the navigation drawer and then
tabs but really your tabs and your

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460
tabs but really your tabs and your
 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.040
tabs but really your tabs and your
spinner should never precede the drawer

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050
spinner should never precede the drawer
 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.740
spinner should never precede the drawer
the drawer always should represent the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750
the drawer always should represent the
 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.899
the drawer always should represent the
topmost level of your application

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909
topmost level of your application
 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.360
topmost level of your application
hierarchy so this is a somewhat

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370
hierarchy so this is a somewhat
 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.550
hierarchy so this is a somewhat
contrived example that we have three

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560
contrived example that we have three
 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.320
contrived example that we have three
different levels of hierarchy of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330
different levels of hierarchy of
 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.329
different levels of hierarchy of
navigation hierarchy in South Asia you

00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:29.339
navigation hierarchy in South Asia you
 

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:30.529
navigation hierarchy in South Asia you
probably would generally want to avoid

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:30.539
probably would generally want to avoid
 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.019
probably would generally want to avoid
that and perhaps you might do something

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029
that and perhaps you might do something
 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.730
that and perhaps you might do something
like having two levels of hierarchy in

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740
like having two levels of hierarchy in
 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.890
like having two levels of hierarchy in
your drawer or by a classical section

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900
your drawer or by a classical section
 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.379
your drawer or by a classical section
which we'll cover in its section and but

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389
which we'll cover in its section and but
 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.089
which we'll cover in its section and but
if you do have that kind of complex IRA

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:41.099
if you do have that kind of complex IRA
 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:42.499
if you do have that kind of complex IRA
rocket and due respect this you

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509
rocket and due respect this you
 

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:45.050
rocket and due respect this you
generally want to go for a top downwards

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060
generally want to go for a top downwards
 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.019
generally want to go for a top downwards
scan as the highest level you know that

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029
scan as the highest level you know that
 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.999
scan as the highest level you know that
is a natural mapping to the root of your

00:05:49.999 --> 00:05:50.009
is a natural mapping to the root of your
 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:53.119
is a natural mapping to the root of your
navigation and one thing can't wrinkle I

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:53.129
navigation and one thing can't wrinkle I
 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.700
navigation and one thing can't wrinkle I
guess and as you'll see the drawer is

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710
guess and as you'll see the drawer is
 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:57.939
guess and as you'll see the drawer is
obviously underneath the action bar and

00:05:57.939 --> 00:05:57.949
obviously underneath the action bar and
 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:59.719
obviously underneath the action bar and
differently that when you open the

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729
differently that when you open the
 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.579
differently that when you open the
drawer the action bar is expected to

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:01.589
drawer the action bar is expected to
 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:04.309
drawer the action bar is expected to
transform so in this instance you were

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319
transform so in this instance you were
 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.920
transform so in this instance you were
to get kind of only avoid an option so

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930
to get kind of only avoid an option so
 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.119
to get kind of only avoid an option so
in this case you the spirit would

00:06:08.119 --> 00:06:08.129
in this case you the spirit would
 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:09.499
in this case you the spirit would
disappear you'd probably just have the

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509
disappear you'd probably just have the
 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.110
disappear you'd probably just have the
application name itself and any action

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120
application name itself and any action
 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.279
application name itself and any action
that's not relevant to the entire

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289
that's not relevant to the entire
 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.529
that's not relevant to the entire
application should disappear from that

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539
application should disappear from that
 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:18.170
application should disappear from that
and so yeah only further top-down

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180
and so yeah only further top-down
 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.209
and so yeah only further top-down
approach you'll be okay and another

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219
approach you'll be okay and another
 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:21.619
approach you'll be okay and another
thing with the drawer is that we did

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:21.629
thing with the drawer is that we did
 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:23.420
thing with the drawer is that we did
have another episode specifically about

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430
have another episode specifically about
 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.179
have another episode specifically about
using the navigation drawer as and we

00:06:26.179 --> 00:06:26.189
using the navigation drawer as and we
 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:28.339
using the navigation drawer as and we
had believe rich Fulcher and Jen's Nagel

00:06:28.339 --> 00:06:28.349
had believe rich Fulcher and Jen's Nagel
 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:30.320
had believe rich Fulcher and Jen's Nagel
from the Android design team that talked

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:30.330
from the Android design team that talked
 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.969
from the Android design team that talked
a little bit about you know how to use

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:31.979
a little bit about you know how to use
 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:34.639
a little bit about you know how to use
the drawer and in which cases it's most

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:34.649
the drawer and in which cases it's most
 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:37.159
the drawer and in which cases it's most
useful so definitely take a look at that

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:37.169
useful so definitely take a look at that
 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:38.959
useful so definitely take a look at that
episode if you have more questions about

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969
episode if you have more questions about
 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:40.770
episode if you have more questions about
using the drawer

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780
using the drawer
 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.370
using the drawer
okay with that let's move on absolutely

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:44.380
okay with that let's move on absolutely
 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:46.740
okay with that let's move on absolutely
so the next panel that we want to cover

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:46.750
so the next panel that we want to cover
 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.770
so the next panel that we want to cover
is talking about and taps so times in

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780
is talking about and taps so times in
 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.490
is talking about and taps so times in
Android have a very high strong and

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500
Android have a very high strong and
 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.410
Android have a very high strong and
mental link to horizontal swipe so

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:55.420
mental link to horizontal swipe so
 

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:56.990
mental link to horizontal swipe so
whenever you see tabs you kind of

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:57.000
whenever you see tabs you kind of
 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.070
whenever you see tabs you kind of
absolutely expect to be able to

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080
absolutely expect to be able to
 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.120
absolutely expect to be able to
horizontally and swipe between content

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130
horizontally and swipe between content
 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:05.070
horizontally and swipe between content
so for that reason if you do have some

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.080
so for that reason if you do have some
 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.380
so for that reason if you do have some
kind of a generative content and you do

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390
kind of a generative content and you do
 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.780
kind of a generative content and you do
want to be careful about and putting

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:09.790
want to be careful about and putting
 

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.420
want to be careful about and putting
that within tabs because you gotta have

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:12.430
that within tabs because you gotta have
 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.340
that within tabs because you gotta have
some swipe ambiguity lock you know you

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:14.350
some swipe ambiguity lock you know you
 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.200
some swipe ambiguity lock you know you
when you see a tab you expect to be able

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:16.210
when you see a tab you expect to be able
 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.270
when you see a tab you expect to be able
to swipe to change between not to leave

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:18.280
to swipe to change between not to leave
 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:20.790
to swipe to change between not to leave
the content within it so one thing to

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:20.800
the content within it so one thing to
 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.010
the content within it so one thing to
add here is that if it's a part of the

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:23.020
add here is that if it's a part of the
 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:24.840
add here is that if it's a part of the
tab it's maybe like a small section

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:24.850
tab it's maybe like a small section
 

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.610
tab it's maybe like a small section
that's swipeable let's say you have you

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620
that's swipeable let's say you have you
 

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:28.590
that's swipeable let's say you have you
know horizontally scrolling photo

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:28.600
know horizontally scrolling photo
 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.420
know horizontally scrolling photo
gallery or something like that if it's a

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:30.430
gallery or something like that if it's a
 

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.640
gallery or something like that if it's a
part of the tab and it's generally okay

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:32.650
part of the tab and it's generally okay
 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.760
part of the tab and it's generally okay
you know it's there are cases where it's

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:35.770
you know it's there are cases where it's
 

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.610
you know it's there are cases where it's
possible to kind of do this it's just

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:38.620
possible to kind of do this it's just
 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.400
possible to kind of do this it's just
the issue here is that the entire tab

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:41.410
the issue here is that the entire tab
 

00:07:41.410 --> 00:07:43.950
the issue here is that the entire tab
contents are another left and right

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960
contents are another left and right
 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.990
contents are another left and right
swipe region and so it creates this kind

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:46.000
swipe region and so it creates this kind
 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.150
swipe region and so it creates this kind
of ambiguity between am i swiping

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160
of ambiguity between am i swiping
 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.890
of ambiguity between am i swiping
between tabs or am i swiping between

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:49.900
between tabs or am i swiping between
 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:52.920
between tabs or am i swiping between
pages in cases like if you have a map

00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:52.930
pages in cases like if you have a map
 

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.600
pages in cases like if you have a map
where it's not really swiping between

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.610
where it's not really swiping between
 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.440
where it's not really swiping between
pages you're kind of panning a surface

00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.450
pages you're kind of panning a surface
 

00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.240
pages you're kind of panning a surface
it's it's also okay but it's again

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.250
it's it's also okay but it's again
 

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:01.710
it's it's also okay but it's again
something that you may want to rethink

00:08:01.710 --> 00:08:01.720
something that you may want to rethink
 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.230
something that you may want to rethink
because there will be that ambiguity but

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240
because there will be that ambiguity but
 

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.719
because there will be that ambiguity but
in this case I mean this is just kind of

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:06.729
in this case I mean this is just kind of
 

00:08:06.729 --> 00:08:09.620
in this case I mean this is just kind of
one of those textbook cases I guess of

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:09.630
one of those textbook cases I guess of
 

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.330
one of those textbook cases I guess of
ambiguity kind of really you know

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:12.340
ambiguity kind of really you know
 

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.400
ambiguity kind of really you know
messing messing with the standard

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:14.410
messing messing with the standard
 

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.280
messing messing with the standard
Android pattern or standard Android

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:17.290
Android pattern or standard Android
 

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.740

interaction of tabs being directly

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:19.750
interaction of tabs being directly
 

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:23.490
interaction of tabs being directly
linked with their content so instead of

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:23.500
linked with their content so instead of
 

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:25.610
linked with their content so instead of
doing this another way to I guess solve

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:25.620
doing this another way to I guess solve
 

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:27.810
doing this another way to I guess solve
solve this issue is to instead of doing

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:27.820
solve this issue is to instead of doing
 

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.110
solve this issue is to instead of doing
horizontal paging you can kind of do a

00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120
horizontal paging you can kind of do a
 

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.940
horizontal paging you can kind of do a
vertical scrolling type thing for the

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:32.950
vertical scrolling type thing for the
 

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.640
vertical scrolling type thing for the
tab contents so basically any time you

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:35.650
tab contents so basically any time you
 

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:38.219
tab contents so basically any time you
have nested horizontal swiping really

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:38.229
have nested horizontal swiping really
 

00:08:38.229 --> 00:08:39.959
have nested horizontal swiping really
try to think is there a better way to

00:08:39.959 --> 00:08:39.969
try to think is there a better way to
 

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.120
try to think is there a better way to
present this maybe it's breaking out the

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.130
present this maybe it's breaking out the
 

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.579
present this maybe it's breaking out the
content into a separate screen maybe

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:44.589
content into a separate screen maybe
 

00:08:44.589 --> 00:08:46.530
content into a separate screen maybe
it's using a different interaction

00:08:46.530 --> 00:08:46.540
it's using a different interaction
 

00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.570
it's using a different interaction
vertical scrolling versus horizontal

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:48.580
vertical scrolling versus horizontal
 

00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:51.120
vertical scrolling versus horizontal
paging but really kind of think about

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:51.130
paging but really kind of think about
 

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:52.500
paging but really kind of think about
that because that is something that can

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:52.510
that because that is something that can
 

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:55.620
that because that is something that can
create that ambiguity

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:55.630
 
 

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.030
 
so the next anti-pattern we're going to

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:58.040
so the next anti-pattern we're going to
 

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:01.150
so the next anti-pattern we're going to
talk about is deep or persistent tabs

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.160
talk about is deep or persistent tabs
 

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.780
talk about is deep or persistent tabs
these often go hand-in-hand so first let

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:04.790
these often go hand-in-hand so first let
 

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:07.060
these often go hand-in-hand so first let
me talk about deep tabs when we say deep

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.070
me talk about deep tabs when we say deep
 

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.670
me talk about deep tabs when we say deep
tabs we really talk about I guess we

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:09.680
tabs we really talk about I guess we
 

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.819
tabs we really talk about I guess we
compare deep versus shallow tabs on

00:09:12.819 --> 00:09:12.829
compare deep versus shallow tabs on
 

00:09:12.829 --> 00:09:15.699
compare deep versus shallow tabs on
Android tabs should be shallow what that

00:09:15.699 --> 00:09:15.709
Android tabs should be shallow what that
 

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:17.050
Android tabs should be shallow what that
means is that there shouldn't be too

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:17.060
means is that there shouldn't be too
 

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:19.720
means is that there shouldn't be too
much navigation within tabs maybe you

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:19.730
much navigation within tabs maybe you
 

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.759
much navigation within tabs maybe you
have like a view switch like you like

00:09:21.759 --> 00:09:21.769
have like a view switch like you like
 

00:09:21.769 --> 00:09:24.160
have like a view switch like you like
change the sort order or something or

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:24.170
change the sort order or something or
 

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.710
change the sort order or something or
something like that or maybe you have

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720
something like that or maybe you have
 

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.540
something like that or maybe you have
you know scrolling and whatever but you

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:28.550
you know scrolling and whatever but you
 

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.949
you know scrolling and whatever but you
really shouldn't have any sort of

00:09:29.949 --> 00:09:29.959
really shouldn't have any sort of
 

00:09:29.959 --> 00:09:33.639
really shouldn't have any sort of
hierarchy or history within the tab what

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:33.649
hierarchy or history within the tab what
 

00:09:33.649 --> 00:09:35.019
hierarchy or history within the tab what
that means is you know in this example

00:09:35.019 --> 00:09:35.029
that means is you know in this example
 

00:09:35.029 --> 00:09:36.699
that means is you know in this example
let's say you're looking at the contents

00:09:36.699 --> 00:09:36.709
let's say you're looking at the contents
 

00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.530
let's say you're looking at the contents
of a tab and you select one of these

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:38.540
of a tab and you select one of these
 

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:41.680
of a tab and you select one of these
grid items you shouldn't you should take

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:41.690
grid items you shouldn't you should take
 

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:43.930
grid items you shouldn't you should take
the user to a new screen you shouldn't

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:43.940
the user to a new screen you shouldn't
 

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.180
the user to a new screen you shouldn't
actually take the user or update the

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:46.190
actually take the user or update the
 

00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.000
actually take the user or update the
contents of the tab with whatever you

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.010
contents of the tab with whatever you
 

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.440
contents of the tab with whatever you
just clicked on and then when you press

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:50.450
just clicked on and then when you press
 

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.300
just clicked on and then when you press
back and I would go back here this is

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:52.310
back and I would go back here this is
 

00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:53.350
back and I would go back here this is
not something you want to do this is

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360
not something you want to do this is
 

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.759
not something you want to do this is
actually something we would call a deep

00:09:54.759 --> 00:09:54.769
actually something we would call a deep
 

00:09:54.769 --> 00:09:57.100
actually something we would call a deep
tab a tab that has hierarchy or history

00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:57.110
tab a tab that has hierarchy or history
 

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.260
tab a tab that has hierarchy or history
and so you know the reason for this I

00:09:59.260 --> 00:09:59.270
and so you know the reason for this I
 

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.060
and so you know the reason for this I
guess is that first of all this is just

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:01.070
guess is that first of all this is just
 

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:03.190
guess is that first of all this is just
kind of a platform norm this is not

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200
kind of a platform norm this is not
 

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.120
kind of a platform norm this is not
something that's generally done in

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.130
something that's generally done in
 

00:10:04.130 --> 00:10:05.980
something that's generally done in
Android but the second thing is that you

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:05.990
Android but the second thing is that you
 

00:10:05.990 --> 00:10:07.660
Android but the second thing is that you
know what happens when you swipe to

00:10:07.660 --> 00:10:07.670
know what happens when you swipe to
 

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.090
know what happens when you swipe to
other tabs or switch between different

00:10:10.090 --> 00:10:10.100
other tabs or switch between different
 

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.940
other tabs or switch between different
tabs you actually leave your tabs in all

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:12.950
tabs you actually leave your tabs in all
 

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:16.389
tabs you actually leave your tabs in all
sorts of weird states and the the

00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399
sorts of weird states and the the
 

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:17.980
sorts of weird states and the the
behavior of when you what happens when

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:17.990
behavior of when you what happens when
 

00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:19.900
behavior of when you what happens when
you get back to that tab isn't really

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:19.910
you get back to that tab isn't really
 

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:21.760
you get back to that tab isn't really
well-defined I mean should you reset the

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:21.770
well-defined I mean should you reset the
 

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:24.519
well-defined I mean should you reset the
tab back to its top level should you you

00:10:24.519 --> 00:10:24.529
tab back to its top level should you you
 

00:10:24.529 --> 00:10:26.740
tab back to its top level should you you
know stay where it is you really kind of

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:26.750
know stay where it is you really kind of
 

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.350
know stay where it is you really kind of
don't want to have too much state going

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:29.360
don't want to have too much state going
 

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.300
don't want to have too much state going
on this is actually a recurring theme

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.310
on this is actually a recurring theme
 

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.579
on this is actually a recurring theme
when your app has too much state that

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:33.589
when your app has too much state that
 

00:10:33.589 --> 00:10:36.490
when your app has too much state that
the user has to keep in mind or can be

00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:36.500
the user has to keep in mind or can be
 

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:38.500
the user has to keep in mind or can be
onyx or too much state that may be

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:38.510

unexpected to the user that's going to
 

00:10:40.339 --> 00:10:42.160
unexpected to the user that's going to
result in kind of confusion so the

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:42.170
result in kind of confusion so the
 

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:44.380
result in kind of confusion so the
things you want to avoid and so for that

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:44.390
things you want to avoid and so for that
 

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.420
things you want to avoid and so for that
reason we generally consider tabs as

00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:46.430
reason we generally consider tabs as
 

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.110
reason we generally consider tabs as
shallow on Android another similar point

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:50.120
shallow on Android another similar point
 

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.960
shallow on Android another similar point
here is persistent tabs so persistent

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:52.970
here is persistent tabs so persistent
 

00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.630
here is persistent tabs so persistent
tabs are basically tabs that behave like

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:55.640
tabs are basically tabs that behave like
 

00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.880
tabs are basically tabs that behave like
global navigation that are always there

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:57.890
global navigation that are always there
 

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.060
global navigation that are always there
throughout your app and so you know the

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:01.070
throughout your app and so you know the
 

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.949
throughout your app and so you know the
problem with this and they can either be

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959
problem with this and they can either be
 

00:11:02.959 --> 00:11:04.780
problem with this and they can either be
on the top or the bottom when they're on

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:04.790
on the top or the bottom when they're on
 

00:11:04.790 --> 00:11:06.069
on the top or the bottom when they're on
the bottom that's even worse because

00:11:06.069 --> 00:11:06.079
the bottom that's even worse because
 

00:11:06.079 --> 00:11:07.129
the bottom that's even worse because
again

00:11:07.129 --> 00:11:07.139
again
 

00:11:07.139 --> 00:11:08.720
again
Android should be at the top but

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:08.730
Android should be at the top but
 

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:10.460
Android should be at the top but
persistent tabs regardless of where they

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:10.470
persistent tabs regardless of where they
 

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:12.650
persistent tabs regardless of where they
are are problematic because you know

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660
are are problematic because you know
 

00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.960
are are problematic because you know
they that's not really how global

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:14.970
they that's not really how global
 

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.340
they that's not really how global
navigation should work on Android

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:16.350
navigation should work on Android
 

00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:18.049
navigation should work on Android
especially with things like the back

00:11:18.049 --> 00:11:18.059
especially with things like the back
 

00:11:18.059 --> 00:11:20.329
especially with things like the back
button you know what happens when you

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:20.339
button you know what happens when you
 

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:23.269
button you know what happens when you
switch between tabs and then kind of you

00:11:23.269 --> 00:11:23.279
switch between tabs and then kind of you
 

00:11:23.279 --> 00:11:25.549
switch between tabs and then kind of you
know do stuff within tabs the back

00:11:25.549 --> 00:11:25.559
know do stuff within tabs the back
 

00:11:25.559 --> 00:11:27.289
know do stuff within tabs the back
button behavior is no longer really

00:11:27.289 --> 00:11:27.299
button behavior is no longer really
 

00:11:27.299 --> 00:11:30.319
button behavior is no longer really
well-defined and so it's it's not really

00:11:30.319 --> 00:11:30.329
well-defined and so it's it's not really
 

00:11:30.329 --> 00:11:32.389
well-defined and so it's it's not really
a platform norm as well as kind of you

00:11:32.389 --> 00:11:32.399
a platform norm as well as kind of you
 

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.710
a platform norm as well as kind of you
know there's a lot of confusion that

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720
know there's a lot of confusion that
 

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.769
know there's a lot of confusion that
will result from it to have tabs that

00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779
will result from it to have tabs that
 

00:11:36.779 --> 00:11:39.979
will result from it to have tabs that
are persistent across across the app and

00:11:39.979 --> 00:11:39.989
are persistent across across the app and
 

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:41.720
are persistent across across the app and
for that reason you know one of the

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:41.730
for that reason you know one of the
 

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:43.189
for that reason you know one of the
reasons that we created the navigation

00:11:43.189 --> 00:11:43.199
reasons that we created the navigation
 

00:11:43.199 --> 00:11:46.970
reasons that we created the navigation
drawer was to allow apps to create these

00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:46.980
drawer was to allow apps to create these
 

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:49.639
drawer was to allow apps to create these
kind of global context switch type UI

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:49.649
kind of global context switch type UI
 

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:52.609
kind of global context switch type UI
patterns or you is where you know it's

00:11:52.609 --> 00:11:52.619
patterns or you is where you know it's
 

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:54.739

switch between you know some deep part

00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:54.749
switch between you know some deep part
 

00:11:54.749 --> 00:11:56.689
switch between you know some deep part
of one section to a whole other section

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:56.699
of one section to a whole other section
 

00:11:56.699 --> 00:11:58.489
of one section to a whole other section
of the app you can use the navigation

00:11:58.489 --> 00:11:58.499
of the app you can use the navigation
 

00:11:58.499 --> 00:11:59.989
of the app you can use the navigation
drawer which is available through an

00:11:59.989 --> 00:11:59.999
drawer which is available through an
 

00:11:59.999 --> 00:12:02.210
drawer which is available through an
edge swipe so really I guess the

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:02.220
edge swipe so really I guess the
 

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.090
edge swipe so really I guess the
summarize is very long-winded argument

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:04.100
summarize is very long-winded argument
 

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.559
summarize is very long-winded argument
avoid persistent tabs that are there

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:06.569
avoid persistent tabs that are there
 

00:12:06.569 --> 00:12:08.840
avoid persistent tabs that are there
throughout and avoid deep tabs basically

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:08.850
throughout and avoid deep tabs basically
 

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.590
throughout and avoid deep tabs basically

let's do it I'm going to talk about

00:12:18.819 --> 00:12:18.829
let's do it I'm going to talk about
 

00:12:18.829 --> 00:12:23.780
let's do it I'm going to talk about
actually real quick yeah if that's this

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:23.790
actually real quick yeah if that's this
 

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:25.850
actually real quick yeah if that's this
right we had some examples of ways to

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:25.860
right we had some examples of ways to
 

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:27.710
right we had some examples of ways to
mitigate this so in this previous

00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720
mitigate this so in this previous
 

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.869
mitigate this so in this previous
example you had your tabs you know show

00:12:29.869 --> 00:12:29.879
example you had your tabs you know show
 

00:12:29.879 --> 00:12:31.069
example you had your tabs you know show
the contents of the thing you just

00:12:31.069 --> 00:12:31.079
the contents of the thing you just
 

00:12:31.079 --> 00:12:33.650
the contents of the thing you just
clicked on in this next example instead

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:33.660
clicked on in this next example instead
 

00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.030
clicked on in this next example instead
of showing the tabs you basically take

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040
of showing the tabs you basically take
 

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.889
of showing the tabs you basically take
the user to a whole new screen with a

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:36.899
the user to a whole new screen with a
 

00:12:36.899 --> 00:12:38.900
the user to a whole new screen with a
whole new action bar and an up character

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:38.910
whole new action bar and an up character
 

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:41.299
whole new action bar and an up character
an UP button and then to get back to

00:12:41.299 --> 00:12:41.309
an UP button and then to get back to
 

00:12:41.309 --> 00:12:43.970
an UP button and then to get back to
where the user just was they would just

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:43.980
where the user just was they would just
 

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.949
where the user just was they would just
press the UP button and then of course

00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959
press the UP button and then of course
 

00:12:45.959 --> 00:12:47.600
press the UP button and then of course
if you have a navigation drawer you can

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:47.610
if you have a navigation drawer you can
 

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:48.949
if you have a navigation drawer you can
always expose it here through an edge

00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959
always expose it here through an edge
 

00:12:48.959 --> 00:12:52.449
always expose it here through an edge
swipe so that's deep and persistent tabs

00:12:52.449 --> 00:12:52.459
swipe so that's deep and persistent tabs
 

00:12:52.459 --> 00:12:54.289
swipe so that's deep and persistent tabs
if you want to talk about back

00:12:54.289 --> 00:12:54.299
if you want to talk about back
 

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:57.769
if you want to talk about back
traversing across tabs yeah absolutely

00:12:57.769 --> 00:12:57.779
traversing across tabs yeah absolutely
 

00:12:57.779 --> 00:13:00.409
traversing across tabs yeah absolutely
says rumor saying having these kind of

00:13:00.409 --> 00:13:00.419
says rumor saying having these kind of
 

00:13:00.419 --> 00:13:03.590
says rumor saying having these kind of
shadow tabs we also consider moving

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600
shadow tabs we also consider moving
 

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.900
shadow tabs we also consider moving
between tabs to be kind of a very

00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:05.910
between tabs to be kind of a very
 

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:07.429
between tabs to be kind of a very
lightweight action it's not something

00:13:07.429 --> 00:13:07.439
lightweight action it's not something
 

00:13:07.439 --> 00:13:09.799
lightweight action it's not something
that's going to actually drop history as

00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:09.809
that's going to actually drop history as
 

00:13:09.809 --> 00:13:11.389
that's going to actually drop history as
it will drop something into your kind of

00:13:11.389 --> 00:13:11.399
it will drop something into your kind of
 

00:13:11.399 --> 00:13:14.869
it will drop something into your kind of
navigation history and so therefore the

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:14.879
navigation history and so therefore the
 

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:16.830
navigation history and so therefore the
back button should not unwind

00:13:16.830 --> 00:13:16.840
back button should not unwind
 

00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.140
back button should not unwind
and you're moving between tabs like this

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:19.150
and you're moving between tabs like this
 

00:13:19.150 --> 00:13:21.300
and you're moving between tabs like this
so in this example here if you're on the

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:21.310
so in this example here if you're on the
 

00:13:21.310 --> 00:13:24.990
so in this example here if you're on the
third tab anywhere to kind of tap or

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:25.000
third tab anywhere to kind of tap or
 

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.080
third tab anywhere to kind of tap or
swipe between them and tapping tapping

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:28.090
swipe between them and tapping tapping
 

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:30.660
swipe between them and tapping tapping
Bashan and one key in fact if you can

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:30.670
Bashan and one key in fact if you can
 

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.370
Bashan and one key in fact if you can
embrace the fact of having swipe between

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:32.380
embrace the fact of having swipe between
 

00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.190
embrace the fact of having swipe between
it but feel pretty unnatural for a top

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:35.200
it but feel pretty unnatural for a top
 

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:37.230
it but feel pretty unnatural for a top
of a Batman 2 &amp; Windus flight button and

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:37.240
of a Batman 2 &amp; Windus flight button and
 

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.210
of a Batman 2 &amp; Windus flight button and
so that's one of the reasons why we say

00:13:39.210 --> 00:13:39.220
so that's one of the reasons why we say
 

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:42.270
so that's one of the reasons why we say
not to do that exactly and a similar

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:42.280
not to do that exactly and a similar
 

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.850
not to do that exactly and a similar
area where you shouldn't wear the back

00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:44.860
area where you shouldn't wear the back
 

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.920
area where you shouldn't wear the back
button shouldn't do maybe what you you

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:46.930
button shouldn't do maybe what you you
 

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:50.580
button shouldn't do maybe what you you
think it should do is when you're when

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:50.590
think it should do is when you're when
 

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:51.990
think it should do is when you're when
you're changing between different drawer

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.000
you're changing between different drawer
 

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.720
you're changing between different drawer
sections so for the drawer you know you

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:54.730
sections so for the drawer you know you
 

00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:56.370
sections so for the drawer you know you
may think if I switch from section 1

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:56.380
may think if I switch from section 1
 

00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.830
may think if I switch from section 1
section 3 to section 4 you know pressing

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:58.840
section 3 to section 4 you know pressing
 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.540
section 3 to section 4 you know pressing
back should switch between those but

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:00.550
back should switch between those but
 

00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:02.370
back should switch between those but
actually the the platform standard here

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:02.380
actually the the platform standard here
 

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:05.250
actually the the platform standard here
again for the back button is to is

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:05.260
again for the back button is to is
 

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.480
again for the back button is to is
basically when you switch between

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:06.490
basically when you switch between
 

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:08.250
basically when you switch between
sections in the drawer you should

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:08.260
sections in the drawer you should
 

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.380
sections in the drawer you should
actually reset your task stack it's

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:10.390
actually reset your task stack it's
 

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:12.030
actually reset your task stack it's
almost like you you've entered in a

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040
almost like you you've entered in a
 

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.800
almost like you you've entered in a
different app and that's really what you

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:13.810
different app and that's really what you
 

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.000
different app and that's really what you
know what the navigation drawer is good

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:15.010
know what the navigation drawer is good
 

00:14:15.010 --> 00:14:16.260
know what the navigation drawer is good
for if you look at an example like

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:16.270
for if you look at an example like
 

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:19.500
for if you look at an example like
Google+ for example the Google+ app when

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:19.510
Google+ for example the Google+ app when
 

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.210
Google+ for example the Google+ app when
you switch between different sections

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:21.220
you switch between different sections
 

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:22.910
you switch between different sections
you're almost entering different apps

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:22.920
you're almost entering different apps
 

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.470
you're almost entering different apps
and the navigation drawer is really good

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:25.480
and the navigation drawer is really good
 

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.390
and the navigation drawer is really good
at you know at these types of scenarios

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:27.400
at you know at these types of scenarios
 

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.760
at you know at these types of scenarios
but really kind of the guidance here is

00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:29.770
but really kind of the guidance here is
 

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:31.320
but really kind of the guidance here is
when you switch between sections in the

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:31.330
when you switch between sections in the
 

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:34.140
when you switch between sections in the
drawer you should you know the pressing

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:34.150
drawer you should you know the pressing
 

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:36.390
drawer you should you know the pressing
back should probably either kick you out

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:36.400
back should probably either kick you out
 

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.490
back should probably either kick you out
of the app or you know if your users are

00:14:38.490 --> 00:14:38.500
of the app or you know if your users are
 

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.320
of the app or you know if your users are
getting confused by why is this leaving

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:40.330
getting confused by why is this leaving
 

00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:42.030
getting confused by why is this leaving
the app it should maybe take you to the

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040
the app it should maybe take you to the
 

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.220
the app it should maybe take you to the
topmost section so for example home so

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.230
topmost section so for example home so
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.160
topmost section so for example home so
if I go between home and you know browse

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:47.170
if I go between home and you know browse
 

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:51.900
if I go between home and you know browse
and search and store and categories

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:51.910
and search and store and categories
 

00:14:51.910 --> 00:14:54.660
and search and store and categories
pressing back from categories should

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:54.670
pressing back from categories should
 

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.250
pressing back from categories should
really only take me back to home and

00:14:56.250 --> 00:14:56.260
really only take me back to home and
 

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.950
really only take me back to home and
then to the home screen or just the home

00:14:58.950 --> 00:14:58.960
then to the home screen or just the home
 

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.820
then to the home screen or just the home

if you do have one natural in one place

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:07.840
if you do have one natural in one place
 

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.660

which you always expect users to want to

00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:09.670
which you always expect users to want to
 

00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:12.570
which you always expect users to want to
come in on and probably get back to it

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:12.580
come in on and probably get back to it
 

00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.240

it is that you know fresh towel stack
 

00:15:18.639 --> 00:15:21.210
it is that you know fresh towel stack
and to take them back through that so

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:21.220
and to take them back through that so
 

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.410
and to take them back through that so
they have that stability of really

they have that stability of really
 

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:23.939
they have that stability of really

the idea of the navigation drawer is
 

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.069
the idea of the navigation drawer is
it's a stable list of navigation targets

00:16:05.069 --> 00:16:05.079
it's a stable list of navigation targets
 

00:16:05.079 --> 00:16:07.439
it's a stable list of navigation targets
which you can always kind of and get to

00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:32.390
but anyway there's an another
 

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:34.150
but anyway there's an another
alternative if you wanna talk about that

00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160
alternative if you wanna talk about that
 

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:37.480
alternative if you wanna talk about that
one sure yeah so an alternative might be

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:37.490
one sure yeah so an alternative might be
 

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.190
one sure yeah so an alternative might be
instead of like putting all your

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200
instead of like putting all your
 

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:41.350
instead of like putting all your
navigation to draw and you might break

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360
navigation to draw and you might break
 

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.690
navigation to draw and you might break
up to another kind of way of doing cell

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:43.700
up to another kind of way of doing cell
 

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.850
up to another kind of way of doing cell
navigation so in this example on screen

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:45.860
navigation so in this example on screen
 

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:47.590
navigation so in this example on screen
here we're kind of in this the screen

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:47.600
here we're kind of in this the screen
 

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.700
here we're kind of in this the screen
you kind of get you when you switch

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:48.710
you kind of get you when you switch
 

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.280
you kind of get you when you switch
sections you can have some kind of one

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.290
sections you can have some kind of one
 

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.380
sections you can have some kind of one
application type activity there as well

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:53.390
application type activity there as well
 

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.320
application type activity there as well
as content or as we talked about earlier

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:56.330
as content or as we talked about earlier
 

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.780
as content or as we talked about earlier
and you combine another navigation

00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:58.790
and you combine another navigation
 

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.060
and you combine another navigation
pattern so for example you might use the

00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:01.070
pattern so for example you might use the
 

00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:02.919
pattern so for example you might use the
draw of your major navigation sections

00:18:02.919 --> 00:18:02.929
draw of your major navigation sections
 

00:18:02.929 --> 00:18:06.340
draw of your major navigation sections
and then use a spinner perhaps for kind

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:06.350
and then use a spinner perhaps for kind
 

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.530
and then use a spinner perhaps for kind
of sub sections of that so you know

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:08.540
of sub sections of that so you know
 

00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.970
of sub sections of that so you know
don't feel like just because you were

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:09.980
don't feel like just because you were
 

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:11.919
don't feel like just because you were
using the draw that you have to have all

00:18:11.919 --> 00:18:11.929
using the draw that you have to have all
 

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:13.660
using the draw that you have to have all
your navigation and kind of like force

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:13.670
your navigation and kind of like force
 

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:16.390
your navigation and kind of like force
right into that in the same place if you

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400
right into that in the same place if you
 

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.280
right into that in the same place if you
get out other ways to to allow that

00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:18.290
get out other ways to to allow that
 

00:18:18.290 --> 00:18:20.650
get out other ways to to allow that
subsection navigation in a good example

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:20.660
subsection navigation in a good example
 

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:22.600
subsection navigation in a good example
that again is Google Play Music when you

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:22.610
that again is Google Play Music when you
 

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:25.390
that again is Google Play Music when you
go into its a drawer you see things like

00:18:25.390 --> 00:18:25.400
go into its a drawer you see things like
 

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.870
go into its a drawer you see things like
listen now and in my library under my

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:28.880
listen now and in my library under my
 

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:30.910
listen now and in my library under my
library you see things like artists

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:30.920
library you see things like artists
 

00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.280
library you see things like artists
genres and so on that could have been in

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:33.290
genres and so on that could have been in
 

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:34.660
genres and so on that could have been in
the drawer but that was actually placed

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:34.670
the drawer but that was actually placed
 

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:36.910
the drawer but that was actually placed
into tabs the nice thing about tabs you

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:36.920
into tabs the nice thing about tabs you
 

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:38.140
into tabs the nice thing about tabs you
can actually really quickly swipe

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:38.150
can actually really quickly swipe
 

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:39.910
can actually really quickly swipe
between those different subsections

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:39.920
between those different subsections
 

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:41.830
between those different subsections
so definitely think about different ways

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840
so definitely think about different ways
 

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.900
so definitely think about different ways
to do this one thing I should mention

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:43.910
to do this one thing I should mention
 

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.720
to do this one thing I should mention
here is we specifically called out you

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:46.730
here is we specifically called out you
 

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:48.490
here is we specifically called out you
know content one content two and these

know content one content two and these
 

00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.830
know content one content two and these
little wire frames because you don't

00:18:50.830 --> 00:18:50.840
little wire frames because you don't
 

00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.080
little wire frames because you don't
want to just have purely navigational

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:53.090
want to just have purely navigational
 

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:56.020
want to just have purely navigational
elements on here even you know you

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:56.030
elements on here even you know you
 

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:57.669
elements on here even you know you
should add a little bit of content to

00:18:57.669 --> 00:18:57.679
should add a little bit of content to
 

00:18:57.679 --> 00:18:58.780
should add a little bit of content to
the screen you don't want it to turn

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:58.790
the screen you don't want it to turn
 

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:01.120
the screen you don't want it to turn
into a dashboard type thing we just see

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.130
into a dashboard type thing we just see
 

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.430
into a dashboard type thing we just see
a bunch of big icons or a bunch of big

00:19:03.430 --> 00:19:03.440
a bunch of big icons or a bunch of big
 

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.940
a bunch of big icons or a bunch of big
text blocks and you know one of the ways

00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:06.950
text blocks and you know one of the ways
 

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:08.020
text blocks and you know one of the ways
you could do that obviously is to show

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:08.030
you could do that obviously is to show
 

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:10.330
you could do that obviously is to show
content on others to just show images

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:10.340
content on others to just show images
 

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.430
content on others to just show images
you know show dynamic images

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440
you know show dynamic images
 

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.460
you know show dynamic images
representing that section I think an

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:15.470
representing that section I think an
 

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:16.960
representing that section I think an
example of that is Google Play newsstand

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:16.970
example of that is Google Play newsstand
 

00:19:16.970 --> 00:19:19.120
example of that is Google Play newsstand
I don't remember off the top of my head

00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:19.130
I don't remember off the top of my head
 

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:21.220
I don't remember off the top of my head
but definitely don't don't just throw

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:21.230
but definitely don't don't just throw
 

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.760
but definitely don't don't just throw
text on the screen that's a little sad

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:24.770
text on the screen that's a little sad
 

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:27.960
text on the screen that's a little sad
yes Emma anybody's that's exactly

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:27.970
yes Emma anybody's that's exactly
 

00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:29.080
yes Emma anybody's that's exactly
alright

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:29.090
alright
 

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:33.190
alright
our eighth item here is bad drawer

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200
our eighth item here is bad drawer
 

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.650
our eighth item here is bad drawer
transitions so there are a couple of

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:35.660
transitions so there are a couple of
 

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.540
transitions so there are a couple of
things that this involves when we say

00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:37.550
things that this involves when we say
 

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:40.180
things that this involves when we say
transition we both mean the animation

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:40.190
transition we both mean the animation
 

00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.500
transition we both mean the animation
the actual visual change as well as

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:43.510
the actual visual change as well as
 

00:19:43.510 --> 00:19:45.390
the actual visual change as well as
kind of the the transition from one

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:45.400
kind of the the transition from one
 

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.850
kind of the the transition from one
screen that has a drawer to another

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:47.860
screen that has a drawer to another
 

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.350
screen that has a drawer to another
screen that doesn't actually I think

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:49.360
screen that doesn't actually I think
 

00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.330
screen that doesn't actually I think
that the next two items are related to

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:51.340
that the next two items are related to
 

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:54.180
that the next two items are related to
this but basically when you let's say

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:54.190
this but basically when you let's say
 

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:56.370
this but basically when you let's say
you're in you open up the drawer and you

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:56.380
you're in you open up the drawer and you
 

00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:58.980
you're in you open up the drawer and you
touch section one you shouldn't actually

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:58.990
touch section one you shouldn't actually
 

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.290
touch section one you shouldn't actually
be taken to a new screen with an up

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:01.300
be taken to a new screen with an up
 

00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:04.410
be taken to a new screen with an up
caret basically there's this strong

00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:04.420
caret basically there's this strong
 

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:07.440
caret basically there's this strong
guidance that says anything any screens

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:07.450
guidance that says anything any screens
 

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:09.510
guidance that says anything any screens
that are represented in the drawer so

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520
that are represented in the drawer so
 

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.160
that are represented in the drawer so
for example here section 1 section 2

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:11.170
for example here section 1 section 2
 

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.120
for example here section 1 section 2
section 3 and so on

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.130
section 3 and so on
 

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.190
section 3 and so on
when you actually get to those screens

00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200
when you actually get to those screens
 

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.290
when you actually get to those screens
they should also show a show the drawer

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:16.300
they should also show a show the drawer
 

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.600
they should also show a show the drawer
indicator so the first issue here that

00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:18.610
indicator so the first issue here that
 

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:20.310
indicator so the first issue here that
you don't actually see the drawer

00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:20.320
you don't actually see the drawer
 

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.560
you don't actually see the drawer
indicator you see this up caret instead

00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:22.570
indicator you see this up caret instead
 

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.960
indicator you see this up caret instead
so that would be incorrect

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:23.970
so that would be incorrect
 

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.210
so that would be incorrect
but another I guess slightly more subtle

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:27.220
but another I guess slightly more subtle
 

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.760
but another I guess slightly more subtle
aspect of this is the transition when

00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:29.770
aspect of this is the transition when
 

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:32.010
aspect of this is the transition when
you you know go between section 1 and

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:32.020
you you know go between section 1 and
 

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.470
you you know go between section 1 and
section 2 you shouldn't see the standard

00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480
section 2 you shouldn't see the standard
 

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:37.440
section 2 you shouldn't see the standard
default zoom up transition that takes

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:37.450
default zoom up transition that takes
 

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.360
default zoom up transition that takes
you to a new or that that you see when

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:39.370
you to a new or that that you see when
 

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:42.060
you to a new or that that you see when
diving into like you know into content

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.070
diving into like you know into content
 

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:44.010
diving into like you know into content
or showing a new activity showing a new

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:44.020
or showing a new activity showing a new
 

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:46.500
or showing a new activity showing a new
screen you should first of all try to

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:46.510
screen you should first of all try to
 

00:20:46.510 --> 00:20:48.390
screen you should first of all try to
suppress that transition so it should be

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400
suppress that transition so it should be
 

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.190
suppress that transition so it should be
really fluid it's almost like you know

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200
really fluid it's almost like you know
 

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:52.290
really fluid it's almost like you know
you touch something the drawer closes

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:52.300
you touch something the drawer closes
 

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.420
you touch something the drawer closes
and then the the content of the section

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:54.430
and then the the content of the section
 

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:56.370
and then the the content of the section
you just selected just kind of fades in

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:56.380
you just selected just kind of fades in
 

00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.590
you just selected just kind of fades in
or appears it shouldn't be this jarring

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600
or appears it shouldn't be this jarring
 

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600
or appears it shouldn't be this jarring
kind of zoom up animation that changes

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:00.610
kind of zoom up animation that changes
 

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:02.840
kind of zoom up animation that changes
the action bar and does all this stuff

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:02.850
the action bar and does all this stuff
 

00:21:02.850 --> 00:21:04.620
the action bar and does all this stuff
another thing to think about I guess

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:04.630
another thing to think about I guess
 

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.110
another thing to think about I guess
more for developers is and this is a

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:07.120
more for developers is and this is a
 

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.300
more for developers is and this is a
question we get all the time is should I

00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:09.310
question we get all the time is should I
 

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.280
question we get all the time is should I
have a multiple activity or multiple

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:11.290
have a multiple activity or multiple
 

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.290
have a multiple activity or multiple
fragment app when I'm using the drawer

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:13.300
fragment app when I'm using the drawer
 

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.050
fragment app when I'm using the drawer
and there's no easy answer there's no

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:16.060
and there's no easy answer there's no
 

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.420
and there's no easy answer there's no
right answer it really depends on the

00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:18.430
right answer it really depends on the
 

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:21.690
right answer it really depends on the
situation so if you guys have I guess

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:21.700
situation so if you guys have I guess
 

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:23.490
situation so if you guys have I guess
suggestions for the developers out there

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:23.500
suggestions for the developers out there
 

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.980
suggestions for the developers out there
feel free to comment my suggestion would

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:25.990
feel free to comment my suggestion would
 

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.260
feel free to comment my suggestion would
be just kind of examine the difficulties

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:28.270
be just kind of examine the difficulties
 

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.300
be just kind of examine the difficulties
and you know whether or not it makes

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:30.310
and you know whether or not it makes
 

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:32.790
and you know whether or not it makes
sense for your app I would I think by

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:32.800
sense for your app I would I think by
 

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.280
sense for your app I would I think by
default start with multiple activities

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:35.290
default start with multiple activities
 

00:21:35.290 --> 00:21:37.380
default start with multiple activities
with you know replacing the transition

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.390
with you know replacing the transition
 

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:39.330
with you know replacing the transition
but having a like a single activity with

00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:39.340
but having a like a single activity with
 

00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:41.220
but having a like a single activity with
multiple fragments that is possible as

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:41.230
multiple fragments that is possible as
 

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.960
multiple fragments that is possible as
well okay shroo move on yeah we just got

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:45.970
well okay shroo move on yeah we just got
 

00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:48.930
well okay shroo move on yeah we just got
a good example yes and it was only that

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:48.940
a good example yes and it was only that
 

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.360
a good example yes and it was only that
every section

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:50.370
every section
 

00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.370
every section
which is pairs in the drawer you expect

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380
which is pairs in the drawer you expect
 

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:56.180
which is pairs in the drawer you expect
at the draw affordance and shown on the

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:56.190
at the draw affordance and shown on the
 

00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:57.980
at the draw affordance and shown on the
screen and other sections it should show

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:57.990
screen and other sections it should show
 

00:21:57.990 --> 00:22:00.670
screen and other sections it should show
you okay yeah so related to that is

00:22:00.670 --> 00:22:00.680
you okay yeah so related to that is
 

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.549
you okay yeah so related to that is
never showing the up caret and this is

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559
never showing the up caret and this is
 

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:06.049
never showing the up caret and this is
really kind of the converse of that or

00:22:06.049 --> 00:22:06.059
really kind of the converse of that or
 

00:22:06.059 --> 00:22:08.810
really kind of the converse of that or
the inverse of that whatever it is you

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:08.820
the inverse of that whatever it is you
 

00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:11.270
the inverse of that whatever it is you
should so like we said anything that is

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280
should so like we said anything that is
 

00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.100
should so like we said anything that is
represented in the drawer should show

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.110
represented in the drawer should show
 

00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:15.200
represented in the drawer should show
the drawer indicator but things that

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:15.210
the drawer indicator but things that
 

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:16.850
the drawer indicator but things that
aren't represented in the drawer for

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:16.860
aren't represented in the drawer for
 

00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.799
aren't represented in the drawer for
example here we're looking at a specific

00:22:18.799 --> 00:22:18.809
example here we're looking at a specific
 

00:22:18.809 --> 00:22:21.230
example here we're looking at a specific
piece of content we've now you know

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240
piece of content we've now you know
 

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.260
piece of content we've now you know
dived into or douve into a specific news

00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:24.270
dived into or douve into a specific news
 

00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.510
dived into or douve into a specific news
story for example at this point the

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520
story for example at this point the
 

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.700
story for example at this point the
drawer indicator shouldn't be there you

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:28.710
drawer indicator shouldn't be there you
 

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:30.710
drawer indicator shouldn't be there you
should instead show the up caret because

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:30.720
should instead show the up caret because
 

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.810
should instead show the up caret because
you're now in kind of a deeper section

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:32.820
you're now in kind of a deeper section
 

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.669
you're now in kind of a deeper section
or a deeper part of the app within one

00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679
or a deeper part of the app within one
 

00:22:34.679 --> 00:22:38.150
or a deeper part of the app within one
of the sections in the drawer and so you

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:38.160
of the sections in the drawer and so you
 

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.710
of the sections in the drawer and so you
know instead of instead of doing like

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:39.720
know instead of instead of doing like
 

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.970
know instead of instead of doing like
this something like this should

00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980
this something like this should
 

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.090
this something like this should
obviously show the up caret but what you

00:22:44.090 --> 00:22:44.100
obviously show the up caret but what you
 

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.340
obviously show the up caret but what you
can do to still expose the drawer is

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:46.350
can do to still expose the drawer is
 

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.590
can do to still expose the drawer is
allow an edge swipe and again this is

00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600
allow an edge swipe and again this is
 

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.330
allow an edge swipe and again this is
something that's in our in our

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:50.340
something that's in our in our
 

00:22:50.340 --> 00:22:52.450
something that's in our in our
documentation in our design guidelines

it doesn't you don't necessarily have to

00:22:55.430 --> 00:22:55.440
it doesn't you don't necessarily have to
 

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:59.299
it doesn't you don't necessarily have to
show the the edge or the v3 little line

00:22:59.299 --> 00:22:59.309
show the the edge or the v3 little line
 

00:22:59.309 --> 00:23:00.799
show the the edge or the v3 little line
indicator the navigation drawer

00:23:00.799 --> 00:23:00.809
indicator the navigation drawer
 

00:23:00.809 --> 00:23:03.860
indicator the navigation drawer
indicator to have a drawer in this case

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:03.870
indicator to have a drawer in this case
 

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:05.690
indicator to have a drawer in this case
having the drawer there is more kind of

00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:05.700
having the drawer there is more kind of
 

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.669
having the drawer there is more kind of
like a power user feature for folks that

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679
like a power user feature for folks that
 

00:23:07.679 --> 00:23:09.740
like a power user feature for folks that
discover that gesture great for those

00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:09.750
discover that gesture great for those
 

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.930
discover that gesture great for those
that don't you know that's that's not so

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:11.940
that don't you know that's that's not so
 

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.669
that don't you know that's that's not so
great but they always have that ability

00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679
great but they always have that ability
 

00:23:13.679 --> 00:23:16.220
great but they always have that ability
to navigate to those other sections by

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:16.230
to navigate to those other sections by
 

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:17.870
to navigate to those other sections by
pressing up so you're not necessarily

00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880
pressing up so you're not necessarily
 

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.450
pressing up so you're not necessarily
you're not really keeping functionality

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:20.460
you're not really keeping functionality
 

00:23:20.460 --> 00:23:22.430
you're not really keeping functionality
from a certain class of users you're

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440
from a certain class of users you're
 

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.770
from a certain class of users you're
really just kind of adding additional

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780
really just kind of adding additional
 

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.530
really just kind of adding additional
functionality for power users I guess is

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:27.540
functionality for power users I guess is
 

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:29.480
functionality for power users I guess is
kind of two competing things like

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:29.490
kind of two competing things like
 

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.820
kind of two competing things like
compute the same space we want the user

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:31.830
compute the same space we want the user
 

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.919
compute the same space we want the user
to have the hierarchical navigation to

00:23:33.919 --> 00:23:33.929
to have the hierarchical navigation to
 

00:23:33.929 --> 00:23:35.660
to have the hierarchical navigation to
have that strong sense that it's going

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:35.670
have that strong sense that it's going
 

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.100
have that strong sense that it's going
to keep you wearing it within the app

00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:37.110
to keep you wearing it within the app
 

00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:39.710
to keep you wearing it within the app
and go to a parent type screen so you

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:39.720
and go to a parent type screen so you
 

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.990
and go to a parent type screen so you
want the happy hour care act and well I

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000
want the happy hour care act and well I
 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.730
want the happy hour care act and well I
draw one of the great facilities with

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:43.740
draw one of the great facilities with
 

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.870
draw one of the great facilities with
the drawers that you can have it

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880
the drawers that you can have it
 

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.370
the drawers that you can have it
available to you elsewhere to do these

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:46.380
available to you elsewhere to do these
 

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.799
available to you elsewhere to do these
cross-cutting navigation gestures and so

00:23:48.799 --> 00:23:48.809
cross-cutting navigation gestures and so
 

00:23:48.809 --> 00:23:50.480
cross-cutting navigation gestures and so
I'd like to resolve those two kind of

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:50.490
I'd like to resolve those two kind of
 

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:53.690
I'd like to resolve those two kind of
competing computing themes is CI showing

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700
competing computing themes is CI showing
 

00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.330
competing computing themes is CI showing
up Cara O'Malley and the edge gesture

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340
up Cara O'Malley and the edge gesture
 

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.860
up Cara O'Malley and the edge gesture
and an interesting kind of

00:23:57.860 --> 00:23:57.870
and an interesting kind of
 

00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:59.919
and an interesting kind of
implementation detail I guess

00:23:59.919 --> 00:23:59.929
implementation detail I guess
 

00:23:59.929 --> 00:24:02.109
implementation detail I guess
is what you do when you saw images edge

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:02.119
is what you do when you saw images edge
 

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:04.960
is what you do when you saw images edge
- I have the draw over and I think a

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:04.970
- I have the draw over and I think a
 

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.430
- I have the draw over and I think a
really nice way to do this is if you

00:24:06.430 --> 00:24:06.440
really nice way to do this is if you
 

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:08.259
really nice way to do this is if you
take a look at the way people play new

00:24:08.259 --> 00:24:08.269
take a look at the way people play new
 

00:24:08.269 --> 00:24:09.940
take a look at the way people play new
standards this is I'll show the up caret

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:09.950
standards this is I'll show the up caret
 

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:12.820
standards this is I'll show the up caret
and as you an edge swipe out the draw

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:12.830
and as you an edge swipe out the draw
 

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.609
and as you an edge swipe out the draw
they'll cross pay the end of the carrot

00:24:14.609 --> 00:24:14.619
they'll cross pay the end of the carrot
 

00:24:14.619 --> 00:24:17.289
they'll cross pay the end of the carrot
into the open drawl or kind of

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:17.299
into the open drawl or kind of
 

00:24:17.299 --> 00:24:19.720
into the open drawl or kind of
affordance so it makes sense that when

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:19.730
affordance so it makes sense that when
 

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:20.889
affordance so it makes sense that when
you kind of look at the screen earlier

00:24:20.889 --> 00:24:20.899
you kind of look at the screen earlier
 

00:24:20.899 --> 00:24:22.149
you kind of look at the screen earlier
