1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,200
Maybe all of us can sit on the couch.
I can or I can pull that chair over.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,200
So we're going to start with
a story from our producer,

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,300
Pat Walters about a couple, oh my
word. It's the lady. I'm Janet.

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,840
This is the guy. So I don't
need you to introduce yourself.

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,870
That's usually the thing we do, but
we're not telling people who you are.

6
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,230
We're going to call him Kevin. Kevin,
yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah,

7
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,470
that's my name. That's
suspicious at all. Yeah.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,550
It's not as real name. No. Makes Sense.

9
00:00:26,551 --> 00:00:28,200
Why we're not using his
real name in a second.

10
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,060
Okay. You know, this one starts a
few summers ago. It was July, 2006.

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,890
Jan and Kevin were at home and uh,

12
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:41,260
some people you don't know show
up and maybe out start with you

13
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,370
when they show up at the
door. So we were, it was a,

14
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:47,250
we were getting ready to go down
the shore. It was a Friday. So we,

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,770
so we're in the kitchen and
they come to the back door.

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:52,030
I thought the, I thought
that they were fundraising.

17
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:54,880
I thought they might've been farming
just by, you know, the, the blue shirt,

18
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:57,700
the blue shirt and then realized
that, uh, that they, they were,

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,140
they were law enforcement

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,033
[inaudible]

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:05,320
two women and a, I think two men more
came up from around the, you know,

22
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:09,100
the side of the house and they show us
their badges or are they cops or they

23
00:01:09,101 --> 00:01:10,450
were homeland security.

24
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,340
They took me outside and they kept me
and they asked me to stay in the kitchen

25
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,910
and they had a, a woman with me.
I didn't know what was going on.

26
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:19,570
Nobody said anything.

27
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:24,510
What are they saying to you on
the porch? Meanwhile, when they,

28
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,280
when they showed up, like after to the
door, you said, you know why we're here.

29
00:01:29,281 --> 00:01:31,080
I said, yeah, I do. I was expecting you

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:33,080
[inaudible]

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,970
and I showed him where everything was.

32
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,110
This story about Kevin and his wife,

33
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,910
Janet inspired us to do the entire hour
because one of the most basic things

34
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,420
that we do as people is we
judge, we judge one another,

35
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,020
could judge what's right, what's wrong,
but this story and the two that follow,

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,340
they will make you judge how you judge
or at least they had that effect on us.

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,620
We're calling our show

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,150
[inaudible]

39
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,930
blame him, Jab and Ron. I'm Robert
Krulwich and we'll go back to pat.

40
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,003
Before we do,

41
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,450
you should know that this show contains
some graphic difficult descriptions in a

42
00:02:10,451 --> 00:02:13,690
few spots. If you're not in the
mood or if you have kids around,

43
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,490
you might want to sit this one out.

44
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,430
Okay. So what happened in that
first scene and what happens next?

45
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,170
Only makes sense. If we
go back a little first

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,650
about 15 years, it's just an ordinary day.

47
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:30,260
Kevin's going home from work and um,

48
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:35,470
I was driving home going about 65 70 in
the fast lane when suddenly there was a

49
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:40,910
thump in my chest.

50
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,450
Then he just a heat boating. After that.

51
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:52,040
He said suddenly he had this thickness
in my tongue and my throat than about

52
00:02:52,041 --> 00:02:56,830
taste in his mouth. Then
my hearing, feed it out.

53
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:01,390
Any thoughts? It's back

54
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:05,550
when I finally did come to, uh,

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:09,120
he sees his car smashed into the
side of an apartment building.

56
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,390
I do recall the officers telling
you you've been in an accident,

57
00:03:12,391 --> 00:03:13,000
you've been at an end.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,260
He remembers one of them
insisted that he smelled alcohol.

59
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,340
And I was talking through clenched
teeth cause I had bit my tongue and uh,

60
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,300
and my cheeks. I was saying over
and over again, I had a seizure.

61
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,403
I had a seizure.

62
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,260
[inaudible] Kevin's got epilepsy.
He's had it since he was a teenager.

63
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,870
But two years before this all happened,

64
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:39,920
he'd had surgery to remove the part of
his brain that was causing the seizures

65
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:43,550
and it seemed to have
worked. He was doing great.

66
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:48,170
Essentially wasn't having seizures
anymore until suddenly you,

67
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,580
he was lost your license. I
lost my license for a year.

68
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:55,960
Things had kind of taken a nose dive.
Like here he is, he's 35 years old.

69
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,240
I'm living with my brother, I'm divorced.

70
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:03,300
And I have to call my daddy and ask him
now to drive me to and from work and you

71
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,920
think I need to do something, this
is not sustainable. No, no, don't,

72
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:09,754
don't need that.

73
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,320
So I walked into the office as the HR
person where he works for a list of all

74
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,840
the employees, give me a list of
everybody and where they're from.

75
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,800
So she pulled it up,

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:22,210
I go down the list and I get to Janet
Woodruff Littlefield only one that's

77
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:26,290
really close to me five minutes
away. So I walk to her cube,

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,830
knocked on the, on the wall and uh,

79
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,600
introduced myself like, Hey, my
name is Kevin. I also work here.

80
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:38,800
I've got this thing though. It's
Kinda awkward. I can't drive.

81
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:42,190
And I was wondering if you'd
give me a ride. And uh,

82
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:43,900
she said yes.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,130
[inaudible]

84
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:50,980
I really passed by his street,
I mean, on the way to work.

85
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:54,310
So it was like right on history pretty
much. But I made it clear, you know,

86
00:04:54,311 --> 00:04:57,400
I'll do it when I can. And as they
drove together, they started talking,

87
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,230
finding out little bit
more about each other.

88
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,630
Notice pretty quickly
we'd like to say music.

89
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,280
And that was unique because I sort of
liked music that was probably more in his

90
00:05:07,281 --> 00:05:09,620
error. Kevin was seven
years older than Jan.

91
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,350
What kind of music are you
listening to? Jackson Brown,

92
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:16,790
mostly a lot of Jackson Brown.
James Taylor just call um,

93
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,410
funny rate. It's a little,
you know, Elton John

94
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:23,823
it down themselves.

95
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,740
Sing along to the lyrics.

96
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:31,510
You cannot sing with somebody day in
and day out and not have something

97
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:31,950
happened.

98
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:34,350
We wound up as the spring came,
you know, it's getting nice out.

99
00:05:34,351 --> 00:05:36,930
So now it's like, well let's not go
home. Let's go out for a beer after work.

100
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,250
We're becoming good friends. We liked
each other. But for Kevin, yeah,

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,000
it was a little more serious than that.

102
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,150
I'm thinking about her starting to wake
up at night and one day in May as Jenna

103
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:49,770
is dropping him off, Kevin
turns to her and he says, Hey,

104
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:51,150
I really appreciate
what you've done for me.

105
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:54,640
Let me take you to dinner just as
friends, just as friends. Jen says.

106
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:59,090
Sure. So May 30th,
1992. Hi. Long pavilion,

107
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,740
nicest restaurant in town,

108
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,080
so your friends takes you
to a four star restaurant.

109
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,350
You're thinking right away he thinks
this is a date. We're going on a date,

110
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,740
come on. So now I'm panic stricken.
We have our dinner, we leave.

111
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,970
We had a wonderful time.

112
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:15,270
He drops me off and I handed her
the poem. What did the poem say?

113
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,680
You still have it? Yeah, I do.
Okay. This is a little slower.

114
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,500
Each time we sing on the way home,

115
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,770
I pray that traffic backs up so we can
sing together just a little longer and

116
00:06:27,991 --> 00:06:32,991
the harmony can go on forever and each
time we reach my door I feel robbed

117
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:38,490
because we're always in mid song
or mid thought. If only I could.

118
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,790
He gets out and goes inside and
probably thinks, asked them.

119
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:41,611
I gave her that poem.

120
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:45,810
She's going to be so smitten
with me and you go home and what

121
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,310
want to throw up. I just
thought, Oh God, you know,

122
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,910
next day I just looked at him and
said, listen, we got to clarify.

123
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:56,360
This is clearly just going
to be a friendship. He was
seven years older than me.

124
00:06:56,361 --> 00:07:00,830
He had these, uh, brain, uh, you
know, surgery. He has epilepsy,

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,960
he's divorced. He has two
children, parish in here.

126
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,380
You're catching the compassion here.
Try, I'm trying. And he's just like,

127
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,110
I'm not asking you to marry me. I'm
asking you to go out on a few dates.

128
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,840
Exactly. If you go out with me like
four times in the next six months,

129
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:18,800
I'm ahead of the game. He just handled
it and I don't think it was long at all.

130
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:22,430
I can't even remember. But it wasn't
long at all before we were like a couple

131
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,380
and Kevin, um, I'm dopey.
Dopey in love. Oh yeah. Yeah.

132
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:34,890
Doing romantic things for her all the
time. Flowers, poems and painting.

133
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:39,120
Illustration of the Jackson Brown cover.
And within a year we were engaged,

134
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,600
but all the while Kevin
is having seizures. Yeah.

135
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,820
Since the car accident more and more,

136
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,000
there was a point where
we were obviously dating,

137
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,660
she was helping to make his bed and um,
he said she pulled off the pillow case.

138
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,440
It's covered with blood and
one, two, three, four, five,

139
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:03,350
six of you can count the number
of seizures that I had in vitro,

140
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:04,300
my tongue and bled.

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,390
I knew nothing about epilepsy.

142
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,150
I had never seen anybody
have a seizure in my past.

143
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,490
Those would have been big red flags
that I would've just walked away.

144
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,080
But I just went with it

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:17,490
and they both went with it for a few
years until finally Kevin and Jan decide

146
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,170
this is enough. I wanted to be done with
it. I just needed to be done with it.

147
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,880
So they schedule a brain surgery.

148
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,130
Uh Huh.

149
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,410
Which sounds like a big
deal and obviously it is,

150
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,400
but they had every reason
to think that this wouldn't

151
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:36,810
change him. I honestly thought that he
was going to come out of it fine. Better

152
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,410
cause that's what happened the first time.

153
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,850
Kevin had actually gone through brain
surgery much like this one once before and

154
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:46,570
he'd come out pretty much the same
guy. He was still himself. In fact,

155
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:51,370
he made sure of it. I had a, I was
awake for the surgery and that's crazy.

156
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,280
It was. I had to be awake,
had to do with music.

157
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,490
[inaudible] Kevin is a musician
and the doctors told him,

158
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,170
they said that if I lost anything,

159
00:09:04,171 --> 00:09:06,240
I was going to lose my
appreciation for music,

160
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:11,460
that it would be like music would
be white noise. I said, you know,

161
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,180
no. For me music was no
is part of my personality.

162
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,840
It was how I coped with my darkest
moments in dealing with epilepsy and

163
00:09:21,331 --> 00:09:24,870
seizures. At 18 years
old, I'd have a seizure.

164
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,250
I take my harmonica and I'd find a place
with decent reverb somewhere and be

165
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:32,310
right where I needed to be. I
didn't want to lose that part of me.

166
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,450
So as the doctors were doing the brain
surgery, they had his head open, fast,

167
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,440
him to save. You remember what you're
saying? Um, and do the innocence,

168
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:45,330
some James Taylor and while he's saying
they would tickle different parts of his

169
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,830
brain and if they ever touched the part
that made him stop singing, they'd say,

170
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:53,790
okay, that's a part we can not take
out. Wow. Yeah. And in the end,

171
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,430
I think they ended up taking out like
four and a half centimeters. Like a girl,

172
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,330
you know, a little bit bigger than
a golf ball. Wow. But afterwards,

173
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,164
as he was recovering,

174
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:06,230
I had my keyboard in the room and I
tried playing right away, Dah, Dah,

175
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:09,540
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah,
Dah Dah. And it worked.

176
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,240
The part of him that he really
cared about was still there.

177
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Exactly. Yeah. He's the man I fell
in love with after the first surgery.

178
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:18,810
So I thought, well, you know, now that
you've got to do the second surgery,

179
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,970
he's already been there
on this road, we're fine.

180
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:24,440
And after that second
surgery, he did seem fine.

181
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,520
Janet didn't have her brother sneak
my, my keyboard up to the room. Yes.

182
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,280
Yeah. He was very, very adamant that he
wanted that keyboard. Played a little,

183
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,390
yeah,

184
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:38,990
just noodle. A couple of notes, played a
couple of things and it was like, okay,

185
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,360
I'm there, still me. I was ready to go.

186
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,590
So you go home and like
it seems to have worked.

187
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:49,080
Yeah. As far as seizures go, we thought,
okay, this is it. We're home free.

188
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:51,630
And uh, I was just happy
to have some normalcy.

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,220
But then in the winter, by
beginning in the middle of January,

190
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:59,750
Kevin noticed he wanted to eat my
physical appetite a lot more than usual.

191
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,100
Got like insane.

192
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
This is a guy who didn't eat breakfast.

193
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,610
He had minimal lunch and you'd have
a sensible dinner, maybe a snack.

194
00:11:05,611 --> 00:11:08,730
That was it, but now I could
eat the couch. It just was odd.

195
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:11,340
It was not him normally, but
you know, you're like, okay.

196
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,830
She thought maybe it's just a
side effect from the medications,

197
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:19,130
but then the piano, you play
the piano for hours. Same songs.

198
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,900
They used to sing in the car
together. He has stuck on a piece.

199
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,580
He would play for hours. How
many hours? Eight. Eight,

200
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:31,350
nine and then there was sex. You
know, we were happy, healthy couple.

201
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,940
Kevin's nodding. Yeah. Yeah, it was
fine. But what was abnormal was it was,

202
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,870
it was anywhere. Clearly. It wasn't
like, oh, we're in the supermarket,

203
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,520
let's have sex here. I
mean, it wasn't like that,

204
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:45,090
but I mean it was like I could just walk
in the kitchen from banging out of work

205
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,570
and he'd be like, Oh, you, let's
go here. Which struck her as weird,

206
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,050
but then again we were thinking, you
know, let's try to have a family.

207
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,250
So the timing made things confusing

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,240
and more than that, it wasn't like any
of this stuff was out of character.

209
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:02,770
Exactly. In fact, it was all
stuff that she liked about him.

210
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,400
Yeah.

211
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,810
Except now it was all turned up to 11
all the things that were wonderful became

212
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:12,820
chores and that's pretty
much where things are at.

213
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,650
When those federal agents showed up
in July of 2006 I was just completely

214
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,050
blindsided. I said, you know why
we're here. I said, yeah, I do.

215
00:12:20,051 --> 00:12:22,810
I was expecting you. Kevin
took the agents upstairs.

216
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,770
I took them right into here
where my computer was and
they arrested him for what

217
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:30,770
was on that computer. I gave it
up to him right away. Warning A,

218
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,080
this next passage contains some
graphic imagery. I mean, I, I had an,

219
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,760
I don't know if I had fully,

220
00:12:36,761 --> 00:12:41,761
like I think I had just like let child
porn be this kind of vague thing that

221
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,740
meant as someone younger than 18,

222
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,550
but then I read some of the court
documents and they were like toddlers.

223
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,240
They were picked videos of two,
three, and four year olds. They're,

224
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,500
they're at these sites
had the most despicable,

225
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,210
disgusting things you can, you
can imagine infants on throw,

226
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,500
um, you know, preach preteen and you
know, pre-adolescent you know, in a,

227
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,180
in adolescence and you bought these
things and put them on your computer.

228
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:21,310
I, yeah, yeah. It, it,

229
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,620
it bothers me. It bothers me.

230
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,520
Like I said, initially it was, you know,
it was just your basic, your basic,

231
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:33,420
you know, Hetero Heteros,
heterosexual playboy, like penthouse,

232
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:34,830
like sites.

233
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:40,190
And then windows were just start to open
up and pretty soon he says he was going

234
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:44,640
everywhere. There was gay sex. They were,
I mean, there was, there was bondage,

235
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:49,500
there was a dedication.
Sex, there was animal sex,

236
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,030
Zino sex.

237
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,440
I went everywhere that a
button came up to push.

238
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:01,530
I, I still don't understand it. I
still, I still don't understand it.

239
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,410
He say it disturbed you and you feel
terrible, but I just like wonder, like,

240
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:08,130
how do you detail yourself?
Like, that wasn't me.

241
00:14:08,131 --> 00:14:13,100
Like how do you explain it to yourself
too so that you can kind of, I dunno,

242
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,110
not feel like you're as bad
as the person who goes there

243
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,000
without a brain injury is, you know, like,

244
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:27,060
oh, I know. I

245
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,700
say that again. Ask that question. I
guess I'm just wondering, I don't know.

246
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:35,580
Like knowing that that's a thing that
you did and it sounds like obviously you

247
00:14:35,581 --> 00:14:39,630
know, that that was bad. It was a
wrong thing. Terrible thing. Um,

248
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,810
but it was, it was you who did
it? Or was it not? I don't know.

249
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,300
You know what I mean? No, it,
it was, it was me who did it,

250
00:14:48,301 --> 00:14:53,301
but it was me with a complete
lack of neurological control.

251
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:02,590
Yeah. I mean, I, I know, I know who I am.

252
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,910
I did idiotic things that I
couldn't stop myself from doing.

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,510
I didn't want to do it. There would be
nights where it would be four or five,

254
00:15:10,511 --> 00:15:13,390
six hours of going to
the same site and and,

255
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,900
and downloading one or two
files and then deleting them,

256
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:21,310
going back a minute later, downloading
the same files, deleting them.

257
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:25,900
I would download those files a dozen times
and delete them a dozen times cause I

258
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:26,850
didn't want to be there,

259
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,640
knew I shouldn't be there and
couldn't help myself from going back.

260
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:35,740
I'm not an idiot. I mean I'm, I'm,
I'm a smart guy. I'm not an idiot,

261
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,800
but I know I had no control

262
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,780
and that's when he would argue
in court, can we plead guilty?

263
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:45,690
But at the sentencing hearing,
he asked the judge to be lenient,

264
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:49,890
arguing essentially that the person
who did all those things in some sense

265
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:50,903
wasn't him.

266
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:55,920
It was some other part of his brain that
he couldn't control that the hearing,

267
00:15:55,921 --> 00:15:57,090
he called one witness,

268
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:01,820
Orrin Devinsky. I'm a neurologist and
epilepsy specialist at NYU Medical Center.

269
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,820
He's been treating Kevin for
decades, 2020 some odd years.

270
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:08,030
And he says as soon as he found out
what Kevin had been doing had a terrible

271
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:11,840
sense of of responsibility. This
is because of the brain surgery,

272
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,430
the surgery Orin recommended he have
any argued in court that this was not

273
00:16:16,431 --> 00:16:17,264
Kevin's fault.

274
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:21,950
I remember looking at those agents right
in their face and saying to them and to

275
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:25,850
the judge, this could be anybody,
this could be those agents, judge,

276
00:16:25,851 --> 00:16:27,560
this could be you, this could be me,

277
00:16:27,561 --> 00:16:32,561
this could be anybody and we would
have no control over what we did it and

278
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,730
explained to the court
what the biology was.

279
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,480
[inaudible] the way the brain is organized
that there are parts of our brain

280
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:46,250
that are way deep down that
controls like based desires, hunger,

281
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:50,660
sex keeps us alive, but it's
teaming with the nastiest thoughts.

282
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:53,450
We all have these crazy thoughts
in our head now and most of us,

283
00:16:53,451 --> 00:16:56,600
those thoughts are kept in check because
there are other parts of our brain that

284
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,890
sit on top and act like a
lid. But in Kevin's case,

285
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,400
the brain surgeon who did that surgery
removed part of that filter and suddenly

286
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:07,663
the courtroom

287
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,640
resolved. I mean it was just no lid on.

288
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:13,170
His sexual desires

289
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,980
is that scientist have known about it

290
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,520
condition for a long time.

291
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:22,120
They first saw in monkeys
in rhesus monkeys when the
monkeys would lose roughly

292
00:17:22,121 --> 00:17:23,890
the same part of the
brain that Kevin lost.

293
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,120
They became very hypersexual males
that would only previously be sexually

294
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:29,290
involved with females.

295
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,960
Now we're 10 times more sexually active
with both males and females. David,

296
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,400
it feels to me, it feels
to me like there's a,

297
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:41,770
there would be a brighter
line before kids, you know,

298
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:47,050
I think there is a line for
quote unquote normal individuals,

299
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,060
but in a brain disorder case,

300
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,520
those lines get blurred and he told
the court that's what happened here was

301
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:57,990
black and white. Kevin was sick and his
behavior was out of his control. Well,

302
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,340
that's not what the facts
showed in this case.

303
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,570
This is Lee Barton who was the prosecutor.
We saw no evidence of impulsivity.

304
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,760
He says, if you're claiming
that he had no control,

305
00:18:08,761 --> 00:18:10,020
that his brain made him do it,

306
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,960
then how come he had all this
child porn on his home computer?

307
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,340
I believe it was 52 videos and 125 images.

308
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:20,400
And yet on his work computer,
there were zero images,

309
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,320
zero videos of child pornography on
his work computer. And he worked a lot.

310
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:28,260
He held down a job. He
was working every day.

311
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,900
If you truly lacked impulse control,

312
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,800
I would think you would see child
pornography on both computers.

313
00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:36,180
And so what he argued back was,

314
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,840
what was the lid on at
work and off at home?

315
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,460
Seems to me to be an easy out.

316
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,270
So the answer is that this is
common with neurologic disease.

317
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,950
They tend not to be 24, seven is
this take something like Tourette's?

318
00:18:49,951 --> 00:18:52,470
Some people, when they're
engaged in playing sports,

319
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,120
they tend not to have ticks,

320
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:56,100
whereas when they're sitting
around bored or stressed,

321
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,350
they do tend to have ticks.
So you could say, well,

322
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:00,810
Therese clearly isn't a
neurological disorder, but no,

323
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,580
Tourette's is a neurologic disorder.

324
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:05,610
We understand some of the brain
things that go on in Tourette's.

325
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:08,520
The prosecution didn't buy it,
they just thought it was hogwash.

326
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,700
What was hogwash was
his level of certainty,

327
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,100
um,

328
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:18,070
depressed skis and asked the Kevin
be sent to prison for five years,

329
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,110
isn't paying for child porn.

330
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,230
He was supporting an industry
that does terrible things to kids.

331
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:28,660
Kevin hoped he'd avoid jail time
altogether and instead be placed on house

332
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:29,494
arrest.

333
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,610
That was for Janet. Um,
right after the arrest,

334
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,080
I have to imagine that you were
in shock a little like, yeah,

335
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:41,280
she'd gone to see a lawyer and
one of the questions he asked was,

336
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:45,180
is this marriage gonna survive
this? And I said, I don't know.

337
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,013
Ooh.

338
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,330
And at that point,
understanding, I didn't even know

339
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,590
the level of pictures. Yeah.

340
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,270
But she says the moment she heard Orin
say that this was a brain disorder with

341
00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:00,940
the name got Kluver BC syndrome,
once I was able to get that for me.

342
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:02,480
Hmm.

343
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,230
It clicked. Like you couldn't blame it.

344
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,950
We have these experts saying
that it was a disease.

345
00:20:06,951 --> 00:20:08,980
And I kept thinking they'll understand,

346
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,860
not to mention that after Kevin
was arrested and got an on bail or,

347
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:15,830
and gave him some medication and Janet
says it was like flipping a switch.

348
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,880
That's exactly what it was. It was like,
yeah, I got him back. Uh, I was able,

349
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,930
I was able to sit and watch a
movie with her, you know, normal.

350
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,450
Janet actually says in a lot of ways,

351
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:29,420
those few months between the
arrest and the sentencing hearing,

352
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,680
they'd been the best months of the
marriage. He now was just so much easier,

353
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:36,650
calmer. Uh, you could just talk.

354
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,010
The hearing took about three
hours and when it was over,

355
00:20:40,011 --> 00:20:44,120
the judge took a recess, went into
her chambers. When she came back,

356
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,590
she delivered her decision.

357
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,640
She actually wouldn't
talk to me for the story,

358
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:54,641
but I have the transcript from
the hearing and if you remember,

359
00:20:54,751 --> 00:20:59,540
the prosecutor of the, our 10 was asking
for five years, 63 months or in Kevin,

360
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:02,230
Janet, we're hoping for
meaning no jail time.

361
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,710
There's no way they're going to
put them in jail. This is clear cut

362
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,610
and here's what the judge does.
She says, I do agree with orange.

363
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:10,700
It is a neurological
disorder. No question do.

364
00:21:10,701 --> 00:21:13,820
We can't be held fully responsible
for his behavior. She was getting it.

365
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,571
On the other hand,

366
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:19,571
she said the prosecution did have a
point that he was very much in control of

367
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,840
his impulses, at least some of the time.
And so the question for the judge was,

368
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:28,430
how does the legal system assign blame
when a person is sometimes themselves and

369
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:33,200
in control and sometimes
not? Well, this was a crime,

370
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:36,740
she said a crime which ultimately
leads to children being harmed.

371
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,180
And considering that you did have
moments where you were in control than in

372
00:21:41,181 --> 00:21:45,320
those moments, you had a responsibility,
you could have done something,

373
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:46,700
you could have asked for help,

374
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,190
you could have told the people
around you what you were doing.

375
00:21:49,191 --> 00:21:53,180
So even if you couldn't have stopped
yourself, they could have stopped you.

376
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,060
She made it very clear that we have
to do something here. His sentence,

377
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:04,210
26 months at a federal prison
and 25 months of house arrest.

378
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,550
Okay. And I, I believe, I believe
that she, she was, she was fair

379
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,820
and I, I believe she was compassionate.

380
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,800
And about a week before Christmas
in 2008 Janet drove him to prison.

381
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,840
How long was he in jail for? About
two years and she was even, no,

382
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,200
the judge said, you
know, he is responsible.

383
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:28,440
Does that change her attitude
toward him at all? No,

384
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,030
they totally stuck together. She
visited him pretty much every weekend.

385
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,130
The whole time

386
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:37,730
I knew the route and I had my own
little routine down in between visits.

387
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,390
She'd send up notes and I'll never forget,

388
00:22:39,391 --> 00:22:43,100
he could send me mail and they had a
store where he could get some cards super

389
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:48,180
call murky and he would like alter them.
I remember the very first card I got,

390
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,870
it was this very, you know, beautiful.
Supposedly it's supposed to be beautiful,

391
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,620
but it was like, you know, if you need
anything, you know anything at all,

392
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,360
just let me know. And then he writes,

393
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,000
of course if it's pressing you might
want to ask someone else because Oh well

394
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,910
you can wait 24 months.

395
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:06,750
And I remember getting that and just
laughing and then that became our thing.

396
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:07,500
Like listen,

397
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,100
this is a horrible situation but
we're going to make the best of it.

398
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,800
Tell me a little bit about
like where things are at now.

399
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:18,120
I think things are,
are, are almost normal.

400
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,830
Uh, you know, I, I am still [inaudible]

401
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:27,150
Oh, probation, but he's home. Um,
he's working. Life is going on.

402
00:23:27,151 --> 00:23:28,620
We have our normal routines.

403
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,510
Kevin still takes those medicines that
keep that other part of him in check.

404
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,000
I mean I have no libido at all,

405
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:40,210
but I know who I am. I know what I am,

406
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:46,320
um, um, disturbed by that portion
of my life. But um, yeah, I'm

407
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,720
trying, I'm trying to move on.

408
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,030
[inaudible]

409
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,130
pretty producer Pat Walters.

410
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:05,200
Thanks also to neurologist or Devinsky
for connecting us to Kevin and Janet.

411
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,191
Stay with us.

412
00:24:06,191 --> 00:24:10,060
We'll be exploring these questions of
blame and responsibility even more deeply.

413
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,910
The next segment, even yell about
it a little. Yeah, come on up.

414
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,180

Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad.

420
00:24:37,531 --> 00:24:41,590
I am Robert Krulwich
today on radio lab blame.

421
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:46,030
In the story we just heard Lee were
wrestling with a very difficult question.

422
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:48,700
When somebody has a brain
injury and commits a crime,

423
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:53,230
just how much do we blame them and
how much do we blame the brain? Yeah,

424
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:57,040
and as it turns out, this question, hi.
Hi, this is Chad. Hi Chad. It's Neda.

425
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,030
That question is popping up more and
more in court cases. We're increasingly,

426
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:04,060
you will find defendants
like Kevin Arguing, okay,

427
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,710
you've convicted me of a crime,

428
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,730
but you should go easier on me because
I have these neurological problems.

429
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,401
So this is neat.

430

A fairy haughty professor of law and
philosophy and professor of genome

scientists and policy at Duke University.

432
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,820
She's been following this whole sort of
emerging field of neuro law for quite

433
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,650
awhile and back in 2006
it occurred to her, okay,

434
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:26,620
lots of people are interested in this
field, but nobody has any good data.

435
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:31,150
So I started counting cases to try to see,

436
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:34,670
to try to see how many times does
brain science come up in court. Now,

437
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:37,990
the only data that she'd get her
hands on were written opinions,

438
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,330
which turns out it
doesn't happen that often.

439
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,600
Like yours really only happens
in like 1% of court cases, but,

440
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:48,630
but in that 1% of cases she saw
a steady increase and you know,

441
00:25:49,181 --> 00:25:52,030
relatively dramatic. You
have a couple of years,

442
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:57,031
2005 and six I had about a hundred
cases in (200) 078-9200 some cases.

443
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:03,390
And then 1112 year in the three hundreds
all told between 2005 and 2012 it's

444
00:26:06,071 --> 00:26:07,780
about 1600 cases,

445
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:12,430
but 1600 cases that are kind of like the
Kevin Case where someone maybe argues,

446
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,910
look, it's not entirely my
fault. My brain made me do it.

447
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:17,980
Okay.

448
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,440
At least a little bit.
Yeah. And by the way,

449
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:21,930
that number was just in
the 1% she had access to.

450
00:26:21,931 --> 00:26:26,640
So the other 99% of cases may
actually have a whole lot more.

451
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,480
Yeah, we'll wait a second. Is this a
new development? What do you mean? Like,

452
00:26:30,510 --> 00:26:31,710
you know, in west side story,

453
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:35,820
there's this character that officer
crunky and he goes and the these juvenile

454
00:26:35,821 --> 00:26:36,490
delinquents,

455
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,960
this is back in the 50s and they're
saying everything is someone else's fault.

456
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:41,991
Well,

457
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:46,991
they have bad parents and
they have poverty and they
have passion and they have

458
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:47,530
[inaudible]

459
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,730
youth and they plead all these,

460
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:53,320
their kindness sergeant croppy yet
gotta understand it's just our bring an

461
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,220
uptick that gets us outta hand.
Our mothers solid junkies,

462
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,323
our fathers all are [inaudible]

463
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,970
have you just added to the list tumor?
That's pretty much the same thing.

464
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,850
Well maybe, no,

465
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,070
there seems to be something
more compelling for both
judges and juries when,

466
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,010
when you are able to have actual brain
scans, you know, or EEG or whatever,

467
00:27:13,011 --> 00:27:15,470
because now you can say, look
to officer crump key. Look,

468
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,070
I know this might sound like an excuse,
but check out this spot right here.

469
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,980
Here's the proof. I don't
have a normal brain, you know,

470
00:27:21,981 --> 00:27:24,440
and I didn't choose not
to have a normal brain.

471
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:26,720
So how can it be
completely my fault? Well,

472
00:27:26,721 --> 00:27:31,580
doesn't that sound a little bit like
a little too easy? Me? Maybe, I mean,

473
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:34,130
I guess it depends on the specific
case, but just in the abstract.

474
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:38,440
Let me give you the best version that
I've ever heard of this argument. Okay?

475
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:41,720
This is what, when what made me really
stop and take it comes from the uh,

476
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,190
from a psychologist Kevin Dutton.

477
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:46,340
He was interviewed on the scientific
American podcasts and he gave this

478
00:27:46,341 --> 00:27:47,100
hypothetical.

479
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,450
Imagine if you've got a deaf person, okay,

480
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,480
and you've got a child in a
burning building and you've
got that child screaming

481
00:27:55,151 --> 00:27:57,830
out, but the deaf person
can't hear the screams to,

482
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,680
you wouldn't necessarily blame.

483
00:27:59,681 --> 00:28:04,150
You wouldn't hold that deaf
person culpable for that
child's death if the child

484
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:07,210
died. You agree so far?
Yes. By the same token,

485
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,890
if you are emotionally deaf, if you
can physically hear the screams,

486
00:28:11,891 --> 00:28:16,891
but emotionally you just don't have that
kind of mural kick up the backside to

487
00:28:17,231 --> 00:28:20,050
go in and save that child.
Isn't that the same thing?

488
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,110
And when you start thinking about that,

489
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:25,870
there's a whole kind of moral conundrum
that starts coming out of that because

490
00:28:25,871 --> 00:28:28,640
damage to the ear is damaged
with physical strikes. Structure

491
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:32,360
Damage to the brain is also
damaged to a physical structure.

492
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,750
So here's the moral conundrum
I think he's referring to.

493
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,400
If we go along with this idea that we
can use brain abnormalities to defend

494
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:41,240
ourselves in court,

495
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,410
well that's going to lead us into
some pretty weird places as a society,

496
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,680
things may get very, very
complicated as we learned.

497
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,720
We got into a little tussle. All
right. Okay. Where's this guy?

498
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,020
Sorry. So you put this on, it
is a little chilly in here.

499
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,710
This is David Eagleman.
I'm a neuroscientist. He's
a regular on our show.

500
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,680
Is that what I'm supposed to say or
that really spirited regular? Yeah. No.

501
00:29:03,681 --> 00:29:06,140
Here's one of the most interesting
parts. Here's his argument.

502
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,330
Think about a technologically
at the moment,

503
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,570
our best technologies in
neuroscience are very crude.

504
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,600
We can see when someone has a tumor or
damage from traumatic brain injury or

505
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:20,660
neurodegenerative disease, but it is
quite crude still the way he puts it.

506
00:29:20,661 --> 00:29:25,661
Looking for those brain abnormalities
now is sort of like being up in space and

507
00:29:26,091 --> 00:29:30,050
looking down at the earth. You can't
really see what's going on down there,

508
00:29:30,051 --> 00:29:34,160
but you can see the big shapes and the
colors and every so often you notice

509
00:29:34,161 --> 00:29:35,710
something that's not supposed
to be there. Like, Whoa,

510
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,520
what does that create over there?

511
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,790
If you see something that's big enough
to see you take a picture or you're back

512
00:29:40,791 --> 00:29:43,600
in court, show it to the judge and
maybe she gives the guy a break,

513
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,020
but then say you're up there and

514
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:50,090
um, mission control, everything
looks normal up here.

515
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,530
You don't see anything.
Well then back into court,

516
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:56,130
the judge is going to take a look at
your apparently normal brain and say,

517
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:59,310
sorry, well that's your fault.
It's not a biological problem.

518
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,450
So we're just going to say you're
blameworthy. So that's where we are now.

519
00:30:03,451 --> 00:30:07,260
We draw the line of what we can see and
what we can see is only the big stuff.

520
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,670
But he says, imagine forward,
we'll have new technologies,

521
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,590
we'll have x MRI instead FMRI.

522
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:16,140
And suddenly it's going to be like
Google maps where instead of being up in

523
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:17,340
space, you can,

524
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,330
you can zoom in and now
you can see everything.

525
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,770
We'll have new names for disorders
of the microcircuitry and so on.

526
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,870
We'll certainly never get
all the way to the end,

527
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:31,500
but one day we may be able to say like
see that little bit of mangled wiring

528
00:30:31,501 --> 00:30:35,280
right over there. That is because
his mom didn't love him enough.

529
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,030
Maybe he got bullied like we will be
able to see all that stuff almost as well

530
00:30:39,031 --> 00:30:42,870
as we can see brain tumors now because
there is nothing special about brain

531
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:45,660
tumors except for their visibility.
Really what he's saying,

532
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:46,441
when you get down to it,

533
00:30:46,441 --> 00:30:50,850
his core belief is that
you are your biology,

534
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,030
which is on some level kind
of like whatever, Duh, but
he takes it much farther.

535
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:56,850
He says that almost everything
that you go through in your life,

536
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,550
all of your experiences, your culture,
your history, your neighborhood,

537
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,700
all of it is etched into the
tissue of your brain, right?

538
00:31:02,701 --> 00:31:03,930
There's nothing separate. Nothing.

539
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:07,590
They cart famously suggested you've got
the body, you know the physical stuff,

540
00:31:07,591 --> 00:31:10,440
and then you've got this extra bit,
the soul, the ghost in the machine.

541
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:12,740
[inaudible]

542
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:17,460
but sort of the, you know the inside word
on that neuroscience, is that eh? No,

543
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:18,920
no, no. It's all the same thing.

544
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,050
And now that we're beginning to
see that, he says, actually see it,

545
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:27,740
we are on a slippery slope because if you
start letting people off the hook when

546
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:28,574
you see a tumor,

547
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,830
well then you're going to have to
keep letting them off the hook.

548
00:31:30,831 --> 00:31:34,700
When you see something smaller
or smaller or smaller, still

549
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,960
the point is it cannot be a just
legal system that in one decade says,

550
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,590
well you're blame worthy because for
the moment we can't see anything in your

551
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:48,430
brain. And then the next decades is,
oh, you have schmedlin his disease. Hey,

552
00:31:48,431 --> 00:31:50,350
we can see it now. And
we didn't realize that.

553
00:31:50,351 --> 00:31:53,260
So now you were lumping you over here
with the people with the brain tumors.

554
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,500
So then what does that mean? Like we
have to let everybody off the hook.

555
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,450
You know, blame worthiness is the wrong
question for illegal system to ask.

556
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,660
That's the point is that this whole
notion about blame worthiness and saying,

557
00:32:04,661 --> 00:32:04,901
okay,

558
00:32:04,901 --> 00:32:08,980
if we have a biological mitigator then
we'll bring that up in court and we'll

559
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:09,341
say, well,

560
00:32:09,341 --> 00:32:12,400
it's not exactly his fault and if we
don't have a biological mitigator,

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,570
we'll say it is his fault.

562
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:18,640
The reason none of this makes sense
nowadays is because saying was it the

563
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:23,380
person's fault or was it something about
his biology doesn't make sense as a

564
00:32:23,381 --> 00:32:26,790
question. They are
inseparable. Why I haven't,

565
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,180
I have a version of that question.

566
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:32,500
How about everybody should know that his
brain isn't completely normal in this

567
00:32:32,501 --> 00:32:34,630
regard and now the question is proportion,

568
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:39,860
how much do you want to put on the brain
and how much do you want to put his,

569
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,930
what else is there behavior which comes
in was they ability to choose from the

570
00:32:44,931 --> 00:32:48,250
brain is choosy part of his brain
as opposed to as an choosy pipe.

571
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:51,530
Well that's okay. I mean
you're forcing. I'm glad you,

572
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,380
I'm glad you're phrasing
it this way because that's
exactly the problem with our

573
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:57,560
intuitions. We have this intuition that
yeah, your brain might look like this.

574
00:32:57,561 --> 00:32:58,311
You have these genes,

575
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:01,730
you have these experiences that makes her
biology like this. Oh, but in the end,

576
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:06,410
that doesn't matter because you've got
this other thing that's independent of

577
00:33:06,411 --> 00:33:11,180
the biology. But we don't, you
arm your brain, your brain,

578
00:33:11,181 --> 00:33:15,020
however, nevertheless helps you
decide things, brains help you choose.

579
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,770
So the question I'm asking you
that they're helping, who's the,

580
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:21,860
that you're helping the bear of the
brain, the owner of the brain, the, the,

581
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:24,500
the, and that's separate from
the brain. They'll show you, oh,

582
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:26,300
I need to keep doing this
to me. I know that I,

583
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,520
if I have a tootsie roll in
front of me in an m and, m,

584
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:32,300
I can choose the M and m. So I
assume my brain is doing something.

585
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,500
And the question I want to ask is like,

586
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:37,310
how much am I choosing and how much
am I really outside of choosing?

587
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:40,430
Because some something irregular
in my brain is choosing for me.

588
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:43,160
And that seems to me to be a
way to [inaudible]. So this,

589
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:46,040
but this is fascinating because the
way you're phrasing it suggests that

590
00:33:46,041 --> 00:33:47,630
there's, um,

591
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:51,620
there's you and then there's your brain
and there's things in your brain that

592
00:33:51,621 --> 00:33:54,200
might be telling you what
you don't want to do.

593
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,270
But it's all one system is the thing.

594
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:00,860
So when you're faced with the tootsie
roll versus the whatever else, m and m,

595
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,210
everything in your life leading up to
that moment from your genetic history,

596
00:34:05,211 --> 00:34:07,820
written on invisibly small
strands of nucleic acids,

597
00:34:07,821 --> 00:34:10,970
all the way up to every experience
you've ever had leads to that choice.

598
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:15,680
What would it even mean to make a choice?
Completely independent of your brain.

599
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,300
Okay. [inaudible]

600
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:24,890
what about like the 10 Commandments?
Those are like the, those were, those are,

601
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,470
okay. I'm just gonna jump in
for a second. At this point,

602
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,330
things kind of slid off the rails.

603
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:31,010
We ended up talking about
the 10 commandments,

604
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,860
debating the question of freewill
if free will exists at all.

605
00:34:33,890 --> 00:34:36,020
It's a really small part of this system.

606
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:39,140
I'm going back and forth about whether
you can overcome your upbringing,

607
00:34:39,141 --> 00:34:42,380
which obviously you can. Oh Gosh, no,
you can't share. You can, no, you can't.

608
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,520
I can go to the library and that's only
if you're that type of person. Anyhow,

609
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,790
after an hour, we finally got
back around to David's main point,

610
00:34:49,791 --> 00:34:53,330
which is that the legal system
would be a hell of a lot better off.

611
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,870
He says if a, if we forgot
about blame altogether,

612
00:34:56,871 --> 00:34:59,300
forget if it's someone's
fault. That's a dead end.

613
00:34:59,301 --> 00:35:01,520
He would say the better way to do it,

614
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:06,521
he thinks is to focus on this
probability of future recidivism.

615
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,500
You mean like will they do it again?
That's right. That's exactly it. Well,

616
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,920
how would you ever know? So
here's how you crunch the numbers.

617
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,620
So this has already happened in the world
of sex offenders where there have been

618
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,040
a longterm studies following out. Here's
the way it already works. He says,

619
00:35:25,041 --> 00:35:28,190
which he thinks is model. When a
sex offender comes up for parole,

620
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,880
someone at the corrections office will
grab their record and ask a bunch of

621
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,440
questions. What was the victim choice?

622
00:35:33,441 --> 00:35:36,050
Was it somebody they knew or was it
somebody outside of their family?

623
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:40,560
Was it a minor, specific to male or
female? Was it somebody their age,

624
00:35:40,561 --> 00:35:42,840
what was the crime type, all
these different questions.

625
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:46,230
Then the evaluator will take some
of the answers and give them points.

626
00:35:46,231 --> 00:35:50,280
Three zero to one that
psychologist Amy Phoenix, she says,

627
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:53,670
researchers develop this point system
based on years of studies of criminal

628
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:57,480
behavior, massive amounts of data and
once you have all these points down,

629
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,410
then you can add up a total score and
that score is supposed to tell you is this

630
00:36:01,411 --> 00:36:05,730
guy likely to do it again or not?
And here's the bottom line. Amy says,

631
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,410
if you were to ask a parole officer with
decades of experience to just use their

632
00:36:10,411 --> 00:36:13,560
gut, no numbers, we call that
unguided clinical judgment.

633
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:16,860
If you were to ask them for their
unguided, but expert clinical judgment,

634
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:20,730
will Fred here recidivate or not? What's
your prediction? According to studies,

635
00:36:20,731 --> 00:36:24,060
those experts are correct
about 50% of the time,

636
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,690
so you may as well flip a
coin. On the other hand,

637
00:36:27,691 --> 00:36:31,380
she says if you have people just use
the point system, no gut involved,

638
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,100
the predictive accuracy
would be about 70% wow.

639
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,410
70% no humans involved. Yeah.

640
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,060
But here's the thing that
sort of gives me pause.

641
00:36:42,061 --> 00:36:44,490
Like in order to get that accurate,

642
00:36:44,491 --> 00:36:49,380
you kind of have to turn people
into data, you know? Yeah. To types.

643
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,880
I know it seems like, Oh, where's
the humanity in that? But,

644
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,370
but the question we have to
ask is, compared to what?

645
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,170
So the way it currently goes,

646
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,310
ugly people get much longer sentences
than attractive people in courts.

647
00:37:02,311 --> 00:37:04,110
This is a well known bias from juries.

648
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,010
Is that somehow better than having a
scientifically informed legal system?

649
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:15,360
Hmm. I have no response
to that. Dammit. Well,

650
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,813
Robert will.

651
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,493
Yes.

652
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:28,560
It's okay that pretty people get better
sentences than ugly people because I'm,

653
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:29,980
I don't know,

654
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,350
I'm going out in the limits of what
happens when I can finish this in all go.

655
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:37,740
But because what we're describing
here is humans judging humans,

656
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:44,140
not tables judging humans, not data
judging humans, but humans judging humans.

657
00:37:44,141 --> 00:37:49,141
So you went through that with certain
amount of humanness and maybe it's not

658
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:54,130
very rational and maybe sometimes
it's wrong headed or unfair,

659
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:59,050
but if you take the judgment away from
the humans and you give it to a table,

660
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,580
then you invite a different set of
problems, which is the chance for mercy,

661
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:08,940
which is a very big part of justice is
off the table because statistics don't

662
00:38:09,581 --> 00:38:11,680
have mercy. They just have statistics.

663
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:16,350
Amen. I'm Oh, nicely
done. [inaudible] that.

664
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,510
But let me say a couple
of the question that,

665
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,960
that is a beautiful question.

666
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:26,490
And so the notion of we should be
merciful and so of course that's all true,

667
00:38:26,491 --> 00:38:27,720
but the question is, are we good at it?

668
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:30,930
Are we good at knowing who is the
right person to be merciful with?

669
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,450
It ends up usually being the
attractive person, right?

670
00:38:33,451 --> 00:38:36,700
And the person who's ugly and is missing
teeth were usually not as merciful for

671
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,210
I wish this morning. Let me just throw
in one more objection to this. Uh,

672
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,040
I mean obviously as a point, I guess so,

673
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:45,500
but this whole thing that he's advocating
for and he's not the only one of

674
00:38:45,501 --> 00:38:49,060
throwing out blame, focusing
instead on what someone might do.

675
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:53,980
Is that a world you would want to
really live in? Need a fair honey,

676
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:58,360
that law professor, put it this
way. Imagine you do something small.

677
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:01,270
So if I, you know, forge a check,

678
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:06,160
minor offense and in the process
of arresting me and convicting me,

679
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:10,000
maybe the courts do a brain scan or they
do that number crunching things quickly

680
00:39:10,001 --> 00:39:10,900
and they determine,

681
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:15,901
actually she has a predilection for far
more serious crimes than check forging.

682
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:18,880
I mean, she hasn't done any of those
things yet, but she could rob a bank,

683
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:21,970
she could commit a violent crime.
That's what the data shows.

684
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,100
If all you're worried
about is what she might do,

685
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,570
then you can keep me in prison forever.

686
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:30,571
Because what you've discovered is that
I pose a real and future danger to

687
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,200
society. I mean,

688
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:35,740
you could basically convict someone
of a crime that hasn't happened yet.

689
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,490
Exactly. And not only that,

690
00:39:38,491 --> 00:39:41,190
if you think about this whole thing
from a slightly higher altitude,

691
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,950
according to Nita, when you
blame somebody for something,

692
00:39:43,951 --> 00:39:48,000
there's a power to that act that
goes beyond that one individual.

693
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:53,030
There is value to society holding people
morally accountable for wrongdoing.

694
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,990
You're, you're upholding this code
that is important to all of us.

695
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:02,870
It's what we've lived by and clung
to for thousands of years. Yeah,

696
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,690
so you could argue that the
act of assigning blame is
sort of like reinforcing

697
00:40:06,691 --> 00:40:10,800
the scaffolding of society. It
creates norms for people to follow.

698
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:13,890
That makes perfect sense to
me. Otherwise we would be,

699
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,290
well, it'd be like, I
don't know what we'd be

700
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:22,340
[inaudible]

701
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:25,670
so, hey, so you're coming out for the
10 commandments at the end of the day.

702
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,130
Wait, wait, hold on. No. Shut that.

703
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,000
Let's just say he went there
and he can't take it back.

704
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,440
Don't draft me onto that team.

705

It's a time she was in
college just starting out a
bike and across the country.

716
00:41:19,381 --> 00:41:23,690
Yeah. We just got this grant to bicycle
around this summer and talk to you.

717
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,790
Yeah, it's called Davis
projects for peace. Oh Great.

718
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,960
And she was riding through this part of
Tennessee and ended up on this farm type

719
00:41:30,961 --> 00:41:34,010
place where she met this guy. My name is

720
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:38,270
Hector black. I'm 86,
almost 86 and a half.

721
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,610
When you get as old as I am,

722
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,030
you add the halfs again like
you did when you were three.

723
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:49,300
And Hector ended up telling Bianca a
story that in many ways turns everything

724
00:41:49,301 --> 00:41:53,080
we've learned in this hour on
its head. Um, so yeah, where's,

725
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:55,000
where would be the best
parts place to start? I mean,

726
00:41:55,001 --> 00:41:59,830
I think the story starts when he decided
to move to Atlanta because that's where

727
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:01,510
Patricia was his daughter. Okay.

728
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:06,460
He had fought in the war as
a combat engineer, world war.

729
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:11,440
I was not a good soldier. Went to
Harvard, got a degree, met his wife Susie,

730
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,873
and then

731
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,280
did join the civil rights
work in the 60s, I think.

732
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,600
I think when Hector heard about
the civil rights movement,

733
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,460
he actually packed up his bags,

734
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,040
moved to the neighborhood
where Martin Luther King Live,

735
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:27,760
rented a house and said,
what can I do to help?

736
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:32,080
I felt that I wouldn't really understand
what was going on unless I lived there.

737
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:35,620
And that's when he meets Patricia girl
in the neighborhood who came over all the

738
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:39,760
time, just like a lot of kids.
But she stuck around longer than,

739
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,770
than anyone else. And at 11 years old,
she asked them, will you adopt me?

740
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,400
Why you explaining? Did
you adopt Patricia? What
happened? How'd you [inaudible]

741
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,940
was an alcoholic. Sometimes she
drank up the rent money and,

742
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,420
and the kids were out on the
street with their mom and dad. Mom,

743
00:42:56,510 --> 00:43:01,250
there was no dad. And, uh, so we
took him in and she was very shy.

744
00:43:01,251 --> 00:43:05,340
She had impetigo sores on her
legs in a nappy headed, no,

745
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:09,500
your mama never braided her hair. She
was just really a neglected child.

746
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:11,660
And so she just blossomed.

747
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,800
She got into reading, sewing, painting.
She'd make it all her own clothes.

748
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:18,830
She's making bridal gowns as
a second source of income.

749
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,120
And then she went off to college.

750
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:24,230
She came back and started teaching kids
to read. She even took in a few kids,

751
00:43:24,231 --> 00:43:26,810
just like he had done, adopted
a couple of kids. Yeah. To,

752
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,400
she's a wonderful child.

753
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,000
So unfortunately the whole story changes
now in November of 2000 because that's

754
00:43:35,391 --> 00:43:36,650
when Patricia

755
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:44,270
was murdered. I, even, Simpson is
the name of the man who killed her.

756
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,670
He'd broken into her house looking
for money and he strangled her.

757
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,790
And later the autopsy showed he sexually
assaulted her too. At first, you know,

758
00:43:55,791 --> 00:44:00,430
a yellow kill, a bastard. No,
I saw it kind of a monster.

759
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,120
We do a thing like this and he said
for almost a year he could not stop

760
00:44:05,121 --> 00:44:09,230
imagining what he had
done to these visions.

761
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,090
They'd come down and me out
of the blue just hit me.

762
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:15,563
Oh,

763
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,023
you do again?

764
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,200
Okay.

765
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,350
And you said no control. It
was like he had control over me

766
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,830
pushing my face in the mud

767
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:31,770
after I haven't had confessed
and this was right, the murder.

768
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,830
Hector said part of him did want
Ivan to get the death penalty.

769
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,290
Yeah, it was furious,

770
00:44:36,770 --> 00:44:40,670
but then this other part of him
was like, no, this is a test.

771
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,010
This was a test of his principles,

772
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,510
of his beliefs and so he decided he
would not pursue the death penalty

773
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,460
it at the trial where he was sentenced,

774
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,780
you refused to look at Ivan.
Trisha's cousin got up first.

775
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,730
She was just in tears and just said how
much she hated him. I thought, oh Lord,

776
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:04,950
I hear on going to go say something.

777
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,220
It's probably going to hurt her
feelings and when it came his turn,

778
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,790
I had a written statement because I wasn't
sure how steady my voice was going to

779
00:45:11,791 --> 00:45:16,260
be, but I was saying how
much we love Patricia,

780
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:21,650
how much he meant to us and how
wounded we were by what had happened.

781
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,560
And I said, I don't know if
I've forgiven you Evan Simpson,

782
00:45:28,561 --> 00:45:33,240
but I don't hate you. I hate with all my
soul. Look what you did to my daughter.

783
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:38,790
And then you worked up the nerve to
turn around to face him to say the last

784
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:43,140
thing I had written to that is that
I wish for all of us who have been so

785
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,700
wounded by this crime,

786
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:50,030
I wish that we may find God's peace and
I wish that also for you Ivan Simpson.

787
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,890
And he says when he looked up,
tears are streaming down his cheeks.

788
00:45:57,150 --> 00:45:58,920
Then you know if the first time I,

789
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,880
I looked into his eyes and
it was like a soul inhale

790
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:06,680
[inaudible]

791
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,050
I was just undescribable looking

792
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:17,480
in the end, I haven't ended up
getting life in prison without parole.

793
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,300
What happens next was so surprising
and troubling to us, frankly,

794
00:46:23,301 --> 00:46:28,301
that we sent Bianca and our producer
Andy Mills to meet you back down to

795
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:32,570
Tennessee to talk to Hector again.
Okay, so it's the night after the trial.

796
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,640
Hector is laying in bed

797
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,500
in the material. I
couldn't sleep that night.

798
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,810
And you kept thinking about
that moment in the courtroom.

799
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,870
I've never, I've never had it
looked like that my whole life.

800
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:46,520
Never before or since.

801
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:51,150
Over and over and over and
finally he just gets up.

802
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,180
He grabs a pen and paper
and he starts writing.

803
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:56,260
Dear Ivan, Christopher Simpson,

804
00:46:56,770 --> 00:47:01,390
I am writing because I wanted you to
know how I feel after the court hearing

805
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:06,100
Monday when I turned around while I was
reading my statement and looked at you,

806
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:11,730
it was a very powerful moment for me
when you raised your tear stain face to

807
00:47:11,741 --> 00:47:14,680
look at me. Ever since this happened,

808
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:19,600
I've been trying to find something good
in all the horror and pain I have tried

809
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,220
to be a better person

810
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:25,980
and then he writes this line maybe as
a way to push himself to be that better

811
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:30,040
person, but he writes, I
forgive you for what you did

812
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:31,480
to our beloved daughter.

813
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:37,780
I don't know if this will be of any
comfort to you, but I wanted to tell you,

814
00:47:39,370 --> 00:47:44,050
we will both have to live our lives
with the pain of this dude always there.

815
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,950
Patricia tried to make
the world a better place.

816
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:50,260
We should also try

817
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:53,920
[inaudible].

818
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:57,880
Did you think he would write you
back after that? I didn't know,

819
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:01,660
but about four weeks
later a letter shows up.

820
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:06,880
Yeah. This is it. Dear Mr
Hector, black and family.

821
00:48:08,470 --> 00:48:12,520
I first want to say, God
bless you all in all things.

822
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,180
Second, I have to go
straight to the point.

823
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,590
I know God has forgiven
me. You have forgiven me,

824
00:48:20,591 --> 00:48:24,460
but I can't forgive
myself. Not yet. Anyway.

825
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:29,500
I have so much anger at myself
right now. It's unbelievable.

826
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,200
This hardness I have against
my, I will always be remorseful.

827
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,490
I used to hear God speak
to me all the time,

828
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,680
but I guess after what I did,
he took away his touch from me.

829
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,500
Right. No, I miss his voice.

830
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:50,800
I don't know the level of
love Miss Patricia had,

831
00:48:50,890 --> 00:48:53,610
but if it's anything
like your example of it,

832
00:48:55,750 --> 00:49:00,430
it is great. God comfort
you all in everything.

833
00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,800
Few free to us. Me, anything you like,

834
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:09,130
if I can, I will try to answer it.

835
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:11,630
[inaudible]

836
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:14,600
dear Ivan, I was very
glad to have your letter.

837
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:19,870
I think it is important that we be as
honest as possible with one another,

838
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:24,410
and so I have to tell you that it
is hard for me to write to you.

839
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,570
I wanted to know who he was. I would
really like to hear about your life,

840
00:49:29,630 --> 00:49:32,840
about the people who loved
you, the people who hurt you,

841
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:36,800
because I wanted to knew what had happened
to him that could make it possible

842
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:38,480
for me to do with any length is

843
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:40,710
[inaudible].

844
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:43,020
Ivan writes, Dear Hector,

845
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:47,070
I was adopted when I was two
days old as Muslim schizophrenia.

846
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:50,750
This is Simpson. The one
I call mom now took me in.

847
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,110
He was raised by his grandmother's
sister. She's 82 now.

848
00:49:55,350 --> 00:50:00,330
I used to have to stay over there
with my natural mom while Marie,

849
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,920
my mom. No had to work. Very
natural. Mom used to beat me.

850
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:09,330
Blurt out. I'm glad I got rid of
you. When he was a little boy,

851
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,310
maybe about 11 or so,

852
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:16,470
she took him and his younger brother and
his little sister to a swimming pool,

853
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:19,740
and you tried to drone all
three. One sister died.

854
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,720
He stood there. She drowned his
little sister in front of him,

855
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,680
just the most horrible
stuff. And so we asked him,

856
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,170
having heard all this from Ivan,

857
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:35,510
did he still blame Ivan or did he blame
his mom or society or something else?

858
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:39,460
Well, I do blame him. I
mean, he made the choices.

859
00:50:40,180 --> 00:50:42,850
He made the choices.
There's no doubt about that.

860
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:45,730
But he says, knowing this
also made him wanna write back

861
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:52,290
[inaudible] dear Ivan, Ivan, about
his life. I grew up in New York City,

862
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,610
his family, two brothers. My
parents argued and fought a lot.

863
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,100
Basically it's whole life story.

864
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,980
I've always loved working with plants.

865
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:06,240
And after we left to find the
city and move back to the country,

866
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:10,740
and I wrote back, dear Hector,
I was raised in the church,

867
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:15,660
but after starting drugs and alcohol,
I changed to responded. Dear Ivan,

868
00:51:16,050 --> 00:51:19,140
I don't think God has
abandoned you dear Hector.

869
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,310
You're the only one writing
to me. No, we exchanged many,

870
00:51:23,311 --> 00:51:24,300
many letters

871
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:27,010
and at some point in this back and forth,

872
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,320
this almost incomprehensible
thing happens. Dear Hector,

873
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:33,560
their letters,

874
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,400
first of all, thank you for the pictures.
I never knew. Plum trees blossom.

875
00:51:37,401 --> 00:51:40,250
Really just become casual.

876
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:44,480
My favorite bloom is the waterlily
blossom. They talk about flowers.

877
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:48,440
It's beautiful things. They'd I
even, thanks for your letters.

878
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:52,490
I've been closing a story someone said
to be because I thought you would enjoy

879
00:51:52,491 --> 00:51:56,510
it. Do you Hector? Just the most
mundane details of their day.

880
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:01,540
Just sitting around this Saturday
evening been singing him as to myself.

881
00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:07,790
Basically they became friends.
You knew Hector. You're right.

882
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:13,510
I do sense a bone developing unusual
because of the circumstances pitch.

883
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,600
Just not at all what I
expected to happen, you know,

884
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:23,800
and it's just so absolutely crazy.

885
00:52:25,010 --> 00:52:25,590
Yeah,

886
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:26,423
you're actually,

887
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,380
gosh [inaudible]

888
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,090
it. We, we,

889
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:42,090
we started to send him Christmas packages
and we see this box on the floor and

890
00:52:43,490 --> 00:52:45,870
I'd say to myself, are you crazy old man?

891
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:49,170
You're Sidney Christmas packages for
the man who murdered your daughter.

892
00:52:49,171 --> 00:52:53,950
What the Hell is [inaudible]
with you? Just so cross.

893
00:52:55,780 --> 00:53:00,780
So totally out of that goes out of
orbit or something and I guess I was,

894
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,110
because people don't do that.

895
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:11,290
Maybe I'm trying to exact meaning from it.

896
00:53:11,291 --> 00:53:16,291
I don't know because I
struggled so hard with

897
00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:22,070
why I

898
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:25,953
actually,

899
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,650
after years of writing letters,

900
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:33,740
Hector decided to ask that why question
and its most essential form what

901
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:37,500
happened that night.

902
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:42,060
This one, this one. I just want you to
know if you don't want to read this.

903
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:45,870
Oh yeah, we don't. We don't want to make
you read this if you, if you're not,

904
00:53:45,930 --> 00:53:49,230
if you're not ready. I don't think it's,
this might be a good time to say that.

905
00:53:49,231 --> 00:53:50,690
This next part is disturbing.

906
00:53:51,210 --> 00:53:53,370
If you have kids or you're
just not in the mood,

907
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,680
now's a good time to duck
out for a few minutes.

908
00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:01,530
Dear Hector, I wasn't going to tell
you. Oh what happened until you asked.

909
00:54:02,010 --> 00:54:06,300
I'm also glad you're
relieving me of details. Also.

910
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:07,830
God bless you.

911
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:14,270
I went into the house around 7:30 PM
I'm used to breaking into place in the

912
00:54:15,661 --> 00:54:18,600
past, so I figured the
house was total dark.

913
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,870
Soil broke out a whole
window and climbed in.

914
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:27,780
I took the VCR and TV and clock.
I figured that was enough.

915
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,160
Went and got $80 worth of
drugs or the heavy users.

916
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:34,140
So it went in about one hour.

917
00:54:34,740 --> 00:54:37,200
So he made his way back to Trisha's house.

918
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,670
It was still dark. So I went back in,

919
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,240
he found his way into the bedroom,

920
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,250
so a computer in Stereo.

921
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,750
So I said I take it and that
should last for the night.

922
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,840
But I got trapped when I saw a car,

923
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,620
so I hid until I could get
back out the way I came.

924
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:58,190
So I saw a lady walk to the room.

925
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,500
I tried to be quiet so I could escape.
When she opened the door to a closet,

926
00:55:03,501 --> 00:55:07,490
I was hiding. As she
stepped back, she fell.

927
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:12,800
I told her I was going to tie her up
so it would have time to get away.

928
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:14,690
She said, okay sir.

929
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:19,460
Her glasses fell off and
in no time she saw my face.

930
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,510
So I told her I was going to take
the car so I could load it up.

931
00:55:24,410 --> 00:55:28,610
She gave me the keys, so I told her
after I found out her name, I said,

932
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:29,803
Patricia,

933
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,430
I know you're scared but I will be
out of here in about 15 minutes.

934
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:38,450
Then she said, you should get
help with your drug problem.

935
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:44,100
I told her I tried in the past, but
I restarted or glad. Yeah, that's,

936
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,020
that's Trish.

937
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,120
She had no compunctions about telling
people when they were in the room and then

938
00:55:50,121 --> 00:55:51,800
I said, I'm sorry for this.

939
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:56,600
I'm going to leave your car in the
shopping center up the street next to the

940
00:55:56,601 --> 00:56:01,601
Chinese restaurant because all I need
the car for was to transport the items I

941
00:56:02,241 --> 00:56:02,910
had

942
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:05,370
and even though Trish was
tied up around her hands,

943
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:09,090
she went to the kitchen and warmed
up some chicken and rolls for Ivan.

944
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:12,110
Then I said, I'm sorry, and I left again.

945
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,750
I got rid of the things,

946
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:19,780
got about $200 well a hundred
dollars drugs and $100 cash.

947
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,130
Then I said, well, I just the
car at the end of the driveway.

948
00:56:25,390 --> 00:56:29,530
Then I couldn't wait. I pulled over
and smoked some of the crack cocaine

949
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:33,850
and at this point he's really high and
he explained that when he gets this high,

950
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:38,050
he's sometimes here's a male voice in
his head and as he was walking away,

951
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:39,160
the voice said to him,

952
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,880
he said, well, go get you some sex.

953
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:48,400
I told him, leave me alone, but next thing
I know I'm walking back to her house.

954
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:50,650
No police had come.

955
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:54,440
He burst through the door, ran to
where Patricia was tied up and said,

956
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:58,260
did you have any money? Cash?
She said, look in my purse.

957
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:03,790
And then Ivan said that the voice in his
head became his own voice and he said

958
00:57:04,371 --> 00:57:04,940
to her,

959
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,880
I want some sex. She said, sure,

960
00:57:08,881 --> 00:57:12,300
you've been so nice. Why don't do that?

961
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:12,650
Yeah.

962
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:16,220
D said, only way you going
to do this if I'm dead.

963
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:17,940
[inaudible]

964
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:19,680
okay then and it happened.

965
00:57:24,350 --> 00:57:28,970
He strangled her, sexually
assaulted her, then he ran away.

966
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,360
Sure. Around 2:00 AM I ran out of drugs.

967
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:34,700
You said that after he
finished getting high,

968
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:37,130
he started to wonder if
he had dreamt it all up.

969
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:40,460
So he made one last trip
back to Patricia's house.

970
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,970
So I looked up at the house, no police,

971
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:47,770
engaged to Lope and so now peeps through
the door, she was still laying there.

972
00:57:47,771 --> 00:57:49,780
So I said Patricia, Patricia,

973
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,470
and then the voice in his head told
him to go back in one more time.

974
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:55,540
He sexually assaulted her.

975
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,280
I couldn't believe what happened.

976
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,080
So when to my mom has adopted
mother and I said, Mama,

977
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:06,820
it's something wrong. Moma,
something wrong. She said, child,

978
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,110
tell me what you're talking
about. I couldn't tell her

979
00:58:17,810 --> 00:58:18,080
[inaudible]

980
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:22,050
I was really hoping they would kill me
in the electric chair because I could,

981
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:27,130
I shouldn't be able to live with
myself and God after what I had done.

982
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:30,530
I just don't know why I had to do it.

983
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,910
Was it because of the
items in the money? No.

984
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,580
Getting caught later on in life.

985
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:42,770
No control or power? No car?

986
00:58:43,010 --> 00:58:47,210
No. Because she saw my face. No,

987
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:52,130
she didn't see me at no time.
Fingerprints left on something.

988
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:56,000
No, I just don't understand why I did it.

989
00:58:59,100 --> 00:58:59,933
[inaudible]

990
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:03,660
well, I feel the pressure has left me
for telling you first what happened.

991
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:06,030
My mom doesn't even know.

992
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:10,410
I've been keeping all this
inside and it hurts. So

993
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:14,400
I'm truly sorrowful for what happened.

994
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:17,820
May God bless you all sincerely. Ivan

995
00:59:24,290 --> 00:59:27,350
did it, did it help in any way to know?

996
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,253
Yes,

997
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:35,370
cause I mean I that
sounded exactly like Trish,

998
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,790
but she was, she was
to really the fearless,

999
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,550
I mean a machine. Mr Burrito, I
can't imagine what a horrible,

1000
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:52,010
Oh God, I was just

1001
00:59:54,710 --> 00:59:55,560
amazed that

1002
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:58,790
she could be so strong

1003
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:05,300
just to be raised because when you love
somebody very much, you want to know

1004
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,350
about their last hours

1005
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,500
and uh,

1006
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:13,690
he, he just, yeah,

1007
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:17,780
he just wrote it in a way that I found

1008
01:00:20,170 --> 01:00:21,003
very kind.

1009
01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:27,070
