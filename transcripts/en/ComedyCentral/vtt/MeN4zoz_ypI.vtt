Unplug your toaster and put earmuffs on your webcam because we are at war with machines

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.809
Personally I've been terrified of them ever since I saw that documentary wall-e

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.230
Damn those robots for making me cry

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.929
These tin cans are coming for our cars

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.520
They're coming for our sex lives

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.819
and they've been coming for our jobs for years ever since the first water wheel replaced Jeremiah the mill boy I

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.029
Tell you no one liked to crank it more than that guy

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:31.889
But thankfully one small business owner is raging Against the Machine

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:37.079
Trademark look this is Fabio. He was given a trial run with hopes

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.849
He would assist customers with their shopping needs, but after just a wee Fabio was fired

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.770
You would ask where the cheese is and he would say in the fridge, or where's the beer well

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.619
It's in the alcohol house, so he really wasn't helping customers

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.450
a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.099
Supermarket greeter, who really wasn't helping customers damnit? They perfectly replicated human behavior that

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.709
Robot is exactly like the 17 year old stoner who doesn't want to work there

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.410
Look at it. It's already at a hoverboard, and it's programmed with attitude

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.889
Can you tell me where the milk is I don't know can I?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.540
pitch perfect and

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.040
I'm claiming a victory because this bot lost its job

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.209
But they fired it in a completely wrong manner the mirror says when Fabio was told it was being let go and asked are

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.229
You angry?

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.339
Come on. It's tricked you into firing it like a human. You could just unplug it and put it back in the box

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.939
Take it outside. Don't let to look at the river and talk about the rabbits then power off

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.369
Just don't tell the thing it's fired because this firing might be what finally turns these gear heads from rumbas to doom bus
