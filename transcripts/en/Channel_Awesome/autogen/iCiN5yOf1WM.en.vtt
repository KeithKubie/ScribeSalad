like this is from Stevens point of view
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
like this is from Stevens point of view
and<00:02:54.910><c> we're</c><00:02:55.030><c> not</c><00:02:55.180><c> gonna</c><00:02:55.390><c> see</c><00:02:55.720><c> you</c><00:02:56.260><c> know</c><00:02:56.410><c> them</c><00:02:56.680><c> do</c>

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 align:start position:0%
anything but I think it's very clear
 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
anything but I think it's very clear
they<00:02:58.480><c> have</c><00:02:58.690><c> done</c><00:02:58.960><c> stuff</c><00:02:59.320><c> and</c><00:02:59.530><c> they're</c>

they have done stuff and they're
 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.560 align:start position:0%

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 align:start position:0%
probably continuing to do stuff and then
 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.330 align:start position:0%
probably continuing to do stuff and then
they're<00:03:01.900><c> like</c><00:03:02.050><c> breaking</c><00:03:02.620><c> it</c><00:03:02.830><c> off</c><00:03:02.920><c> and</c><00:03:03.190><c> getting</c>
