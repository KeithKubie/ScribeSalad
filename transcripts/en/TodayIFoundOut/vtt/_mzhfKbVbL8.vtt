00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.639
Why Toilet Paper is White

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.350
Toilet paper is an odd thing.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.770
Despite the fact that we often rub it against
one of the most sensitive parts of our bodies

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.490
on a daily basis, very little thought is ever
given to where it came from or how it’s

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.490
made.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.580
(On that note, it might surprise you to learn
that toilet paper wasn’t commonly used in

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.910
the United States until the early 20th century
and even later in many countries.)

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.800
You also, like us, may have found yourself
wondering why it is always white.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.610
In the U.S., coloured toilet paper to match
one’s bathroom décor was all the rage in

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.510
the mid-20th century, with the popularity
peaking in the 1970s and then gradually waning

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.809
until today, when, outside of gag-shops, you’d
be hard-pressed to find a roll of coloured

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:39.829
toilet paper.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:41.149
So why is this the case?

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:45.731
There are several reasons, but one of the
primary reasons toilet paper is white is the

00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.089
same reason most toilets are, simply that
white toilet paper looks cleaner than the

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.519
natural brown-ish colour the paper is before
it’s bleached.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.920
If toilet paper was the original brown hue,
on a purely aesthetic level, would you use

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.920
it?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.010
Or, perhaps more aptly, would you prefer it
over the white variety?

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.220
The consensus among toilet paper makers, like
Kimberly-Clark who rang in on this issue,

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.780
is that people consistently choose the white.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.580
One can only assume they’ve done extensive
marketing studies to back that notion up,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.840
but even without access to those studies,
it makes intuitive sense.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.210
That said, there are other factors at play
as well.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.240
For starters, white isn’t just an aesthetic
choice, the white colour of toilet paper is

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.640
usually achieved by bleaching the paper and
this can make the paper much softer.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:28.640
Why?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.840
The bleaching process can be used to remove
lignin, a polymer in wood that to some extent

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.820
functions as a “glue” to hold the fibers
together and makes the tree more rigid.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.810
As Dr. Hou-Min Chang of N.C.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.670
State University in Raleigh said, “Without
lignin, a tree could only grow to about 6

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.680
ft. tall.”

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.960
Besides the added softness, removing lignin
also adds a significant amount of shelf-life

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.960
to the paper.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
For example if you’ve ever seen an old newspaper,
you may notice that the paper starts to yellow

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.210
as it ages; this yellowing is due to the presence
of lignin in the newspaper.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.600
Obviously toilet paper that yellows over time,
especially unevenly, isn’t going to fly

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
off the shelves.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.900
So that’s partially why many toilet paper
manufacturers bleach the toilet paper in the

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.489
first place, but why don’t they still colour
it in many countries?

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.760
There are a variety of reasons ranging from
environmental impact of the dyes; potential

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.349
for irritating certain people’s skin, along
with other negative health factors; and increased

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.490
time of decomposition of the toilet paper,
which is particularly a problem when using

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.510
a septic system.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.950
Of course, things like environmental impact
and potential health issues never stopped

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.180
them from bleaching the TP in the first place,
or adding many other chemicals to increase

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.680
desirable attributes of toilet paper, which
have many of the same drawbacks.

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.520
It also hasn’t stopped companies from adding
such dyes to other product if it will increase

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.760
sales, despite any negative impact.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.390
So while those are definitely factors in favour
of leaving out the dyes, the primary reason

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.230
here probably has more to do with the extra
cost.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.579
To make up for this, they’d need to charge
a little more for the dyed version.

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.019
If this would have the potential to increase
sales, they’d no doubt start making coloured

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.159
toilet paper tomorrow.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:06.280
But as people today already generally prefer
the white, the extra expense probably isn’t

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.180
going to get customers to buy more, unless
they used some pretty clever marketing.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.590
But even then for a product like this, it
would be a stretch unless it really was a

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.200
superior product compared to the white version.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.560
So add it all up, and there’s not enough
incentive for the toilet paper makers to manufacture

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:37.540
such an alternative to the now standard white
variety.
