WebEx is the recommended tool for
office hours and

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.090
teleconferences in the OMS program.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.490
&gt;&gt; Some classes use Hangouts,
Hangouts On Air and other tools.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.152
But WebEx comes most highly recommended
because it supports both one-to-one and

00:00:13.152 --> 00:00:14.960
one-to-many meetings, and

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.910
because it supports client-side
recording at meetings.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.650
&gt;&gt; To access WebEx go
to gatech.webex.com.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.180
Click on the top right to log in.

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.250
To host a teleconference,
click this button.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.060
Then, send your guest this link.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.980
The first time you use the tool,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.170
you'll go through some initial set
up based on your operating system.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.740
Then, once you're in,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.340
you'll need to click Connect to
Audio over here to enable audio.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.790
After that, you can click on your
microphone to mute or unmute yourself.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.100
You can click this icon
to turn on your webcam.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.340
You can also invite people and
get the meeting URL using these buttons.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.090
Or, you can enable screen
sharing with this button.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.060
Lastly, you can use the Record
button to record the meeting.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.210
As the presenter, you have a number of
options for how to control the room.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.550
More commonly though, you'll be joining
rooms run by your instructors and TAs.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.230
So let's see what that's like.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.220
I'm going to join David's room.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.060
I click the link to his
meeting that he sent me.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.310
Then I click enter room
the same way I did before.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.238
After joining I would need
to enable my audio by either

00:01:29.238 --> 00:01:33.365
clicking Yes when prompted or
by clicking Connect to Audio.

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:38.280
If these options don't appear,
the presenter hasn't yet enabled audio.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.330
After that,
I'll be in the same type of room but

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.230
since I'm not the presenter most
of the options will be disabled.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.410
But I'll still mute and
unmute myself, or turn on and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.790
off my webcam the same way.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.040
&gt;&gt; These WebEx rooms are only
open if the presenter is in them.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.690
But if you join them before
the presenter arrives

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.580
you'll be automatically put in
the conference once they're there.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.920
Typically, your instructors and
TAs will schedule office hours.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.710
And when office hours roll around you
can just click the link to enter their

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.660
room and wait for them to arrive.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.250
Web X also supports a waiting room
of sorts in case the instructor or

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.430
TA wants to have private one-on-one
office hours with a series of people.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.370
If that's the case you'll automatically
be put into the conference once

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:19.900
the instructor or TA is ready for you.
