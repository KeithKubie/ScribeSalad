00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.160
 With it's stimulating effects, it's easy to understand why coffee is the second most 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.769
 Commodity trading on land after oil. For many, it keeps us awake and moving through our busy 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.639
 days. But how does it work? What exactly does coffee do to your brain? 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:17.430
 Whenever you are awake, a chemical called adenosine accumulates slowly in the brain. 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.800
 This adenosine is associated with receptors that slow brain activity - eventually, and 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.259
 The more adenosine there is, the more tired your brain feels. Which makes sense, as longer 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.410
 I was awake, and more tired to become. On the contrary, when you sleep, focus 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.630
 Of adenosine dips, gradually promote vigilance. 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.820
 But it turns out that caffeine in your coffee is incredibly similar to adenosine 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.610
 In the temple. Caffeine works it way through the bloodstream and into the brain, 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.400
 Where it begins to compete and binds with adenosine receptors. But because it does not 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.420
 Adenosine, and "drowsiness" effect is not felt. Adenosine can no longer be a predicament, that is 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.690
 It dwindles soothing properties. Which is great for you when you feel 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.930
 Tired! However, with the long-term use of caffeine, the brain responds by creating more adenosine 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.760
 Receptors - which means more caffeine is required to get the same response. This also means 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.820
 That when you try to quit drinking coffee or miss your daily intake, then you may encounter 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.640
 Some withdrawal symptoms feel more tired than you would before you ever drink 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.229
 coffee! 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.979
 But caffeine does not stop there! It also stimulates the production of adrenaline 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.939
 - As you know, fight or escape the hormone? This increases your heart rate and gets your blood 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.539
 Pump, and even open your airways. Furthermore, it affects dopamine levels by preventing l 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.060
 Absorbing into the brain, which makes you feel happy! In fact, this is exactly the same 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.630
 The thing is not cocaine, just to a lesser degree. It's a drug, ins! This dopamine 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.859
 Stimulation is also an aspect of coffee that makes it mildly addictive. 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:41.939
 So you can drink a lot of coffee? It turns out there is a lethal dose of caffeine that 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.219
 Somewhere around 150mg of caffeine per kilogram of body. That means if your weight 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:52.960
 70KG that will need 14,000mg of caffeine for an overdose. Put in perspective, on average 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.409
 A cup of coffee contains about 150mg of caffeine, meaning if you are 70KG, approximately 70 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.289
 Cups of coffee will kill you. However, you should drink those cups every time you make 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.179
 It is virtually impossible to overdose on caffeine from coffee, because you will not be able to 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.850
 Very physically fit in your stomach. You want to start also suffer from mania and 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.550
 Hallucinations before reaching this point. 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.910
 Caffeine also contains halflife of about 6 hours - even if you drink standard coffee with about 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.860
 150mg of caffeine, ie after about 6 hours there will be only 75mg left in your system and 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.360
 You'll be feeling half-impact. And after 6 hours that, you will have 37.5mg - leave 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.540
 More space for adenosine to jump back into motion. This is why you may arrive to another 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.670
 Cup throughout the day, to maintain this glorious, alert and lively feeling. 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.580
 So drink up! Enjoy the buzz ... while it lasts :) 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.530
