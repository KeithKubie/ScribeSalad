00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.930
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, what did you come up with?

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:05.920
&gt;&gt; I have a bunch. Well, so, the big advantage of ICR, RCA, it's cheap.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:06.960
&gt;&gt; It is cheap.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.000
&gt;&gt; It's simple.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.280
&gt;&gt; It is simple.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.860
&gt;&gt; It's easy.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.650
&gt;&gt; It is easy, in a sort of comical or complexity sense.

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.210
&gt;&gt; Sort of practically free. Those are all

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:19.170
words like, free, easy. Those are, those are

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.340
the words that came to mind. You're saying

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.890
that that's, none of those is your word.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; No, none of those was the word that I was coming up with.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.140
&gt;&gt; How about, works?

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.560
&gt;&gt; It did start with the letter f, though.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.564
&gt;&gt; Famous.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:31.236
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:34.911
&gt;&gt; Foul mouthed.

00:00:34.911 --> 00:00:36.280
&gt;&gt; That's two words.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.480
&gt;&gt; Friendly.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.180
&gt;&gt; No.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.910
&gt;&gt; Alright, I need more letters. I'm

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.740
still going back to famous. Fabulous. Fast.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.380
&gt;&gt; That's right, it's fast. But I would

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.970
give you, definitely give you cheap or easy.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.140
&gt;&gt; Cheap

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.860
is like fast.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.970
&gt;&gt; So is easy.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.550
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Alright.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.770
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] At least your, that's what the slang term meant

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.260
where I grew up. Anyway, okay, so anything that captures fast,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.400
cheap, easy, whatever would do here. But what's irritating about this

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.260
and actually things like k means and k and n and

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.500
a whole bunch of other algorithms, is that they're so freaking

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.730
simple, and yet they manage to work. And that can be

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.790
kind of annoying sometimes because, you know, as machine learning people,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.030
we want to come up with these complex things that work,

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.990
but as a very brilliant man once said to me,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.430
you must earn your complexity. So, RCA, randomized components analysis,

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.710
or really randomized projections, has this very simple way of

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.780
thinking about the world. I'll just randomly throw things together,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.570
and it turns out to pick up correlations on the

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.840
way and worked pretty well. And its big advantage, other

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.350
than working sometimes, is that it's very, very fast. PCA

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.130
can take hours in supercomputers, and ICA can take hours upon

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.330
hours in even more supercomputers. But

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.290
generating a bunch of random numbers, computers

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.830
are really good at that, and it happens to go really, really fast.
