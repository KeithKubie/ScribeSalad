00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.380
"It's a beautiful feeling.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.560
You're in the water.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:14.370
You're chasing down your prey and shooting it with a spear rather than casting a line and reeling it in.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.480
That feeling hasn't changed since the first ancient Chamorro caught his first fish."

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.240
In the first two parts of this series,

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.960
we learned how Guam became a modern-day colony and about the fight for independence.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.100
In this part, we'll meet a young indigenous couple

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.240
who's trying to liberate Guam through food.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.260
"Everything we do is centered around that respect that we have for nature."

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.080
"We revolve around nature, nature doesn't revolve around us."

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.440
This is Franceska and Hila'an.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.540
They're working to make Guam's diet less dependent on imported food.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.060
"This is my mom and dad's garden where I grew up, we grew up here in this house.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.980
This fern is actually called kåhlao.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.160
It's used in Chamorro medicine as a tea.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.659
So you just pick the leaf and you boil it in water

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.260
and then you can use the steam to clear your sinuses.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.060
It works better than eucalyptus.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.540
There's really alarmingly high rates of cancer in our community, along with other lifestyle diseases,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.960
which happen because of colonialism and because of the environmental injustices

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.620
that have been brought upon our island.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.300
Preserving our land, preserving our way of life, is to protect ourselves, protect our bodies,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.760
protect our children and our communities. Because we're dying."

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.660
On Guam, the rate of diabetes is twice as high as the rest of the U.S.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.640
In 2014, half of the deaths on the island were due to heart disease and cancer.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.800
"There's obesity and diabetes and all of these diseases

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.100
and all these ailments which didn't really exist before.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.740
Suddenly they're overtaking the culture."

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.480
"This was a community that relied on farming

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.500
and fishing. We didn't have grocery stores on Guam.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.260
Foods came from your farm and fishing and hunting."

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.640
This continued through Spanish colonization,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.040
and even when the U.S. Navy first took control of the island and began stripping Chamorros of their land.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.900
But during World War II, when the Japanese occupied the island, there wasn't enough food to go around.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.780
And when the Americans came back at the end of the war, they took almost two thirds of the land on Guam.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.140
"With the control of Guam, American forces have now acquired an invaluable base."

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.700
"The Second World War was like a huge shock to the island, culturally.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.540
Suddenly thousands of people don't have land anymore. People who farmed their entire lives

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.700
and provided for themselves suddenly have to work wage jobs."

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.500
"So when the military took that land from them, they completely took away

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.900
their entire means of subsistence."

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.060
By 1944, the Chamorro farming way of life had pretty much disappeared, and people were starving.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680
They needed an alternative solution.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.420
"How do you feed an entire island's population instantly?

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.760
Well, it was through canned food, SPAM.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.760
So SPAM becomes part of the diet. And there are Chamorros who

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.000
view SPAM very emotionally, like when they see a can of SPAM they'll get choked up.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.060
And it reminds them of the Marines and of freedom.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.660
Unfortunately, it coincides with them now losing their ranches.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.500
So now becoming reliant on this diet of processed foods."

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.000
Poor diet isn't the only health problem on Guam.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.440
High rates of cancer are also attributed to contamination by the herbicide Agent Orange,

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.860
which was used as a weapon during the Vietnam War.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.600
And, according to testimonies, was also used at the time to kill plant overgrowth on Guam.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.700
Guam is also downwind of the Marshall Islands, where the U.S. military tested nuclear bombs for 12 years.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.080
"You're in the water with the fish.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.140
You only catch one fish at a time, but you get to choose exactly which fish it is.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.200
So you know that you're not getting a fish that's not mature.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.640
If you get the ones that are too small, then they don't have a chance to reproduce

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.860
fish for the next fishermen or for you for next time."

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.500
"When you are reliant on your resources,

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.240
when you, when you fish every day,

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.420
when you eat and live off of the land, then you're more conscious of the impact that you have

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.280
on the land and the ocean. And that's something that is already instilled, it's inherent in Chamorro culture."

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.540
"There's only, you know, so many islands

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.480
that we can say that we come from.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.740
And you can't find the Chamorro people or culture anywhere else in the world."

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:59.200
"Behind me right here is the fence, the back fence to the U.S. Navy base here on Guam.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.540
The families that used to occupy this land before the war

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:08.240
were forced out of it after the war so that the U.S. can build a Navy base."

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.820
[military bugle music]

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.820
"This fish is a parrot fish. This is called palakse' in Chamorro.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.560
Palakse' means 'slippery.'

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.500
It's the best fish in the ocean."

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.240
The original Chamorro diet was made up of lots of fish, bananas, breadfruit, even fruit bats.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.300
But over the years, the influence of other cultures introduced foods

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.920
like lumpia from the Philippines, red rice made with achiote seed brought in by the Spanish.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.780
And, of course, SPAM.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.080
"What is this here?"

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.940
"This is a fried parrot fish.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.180
This is breadfruit cooked in coconut milk."

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.640
"I didn't like fish, I didn't like coconut milk. Because I didn't grow up with it, I didn't like it."

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.760
"What was in your household, growing up?"

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:01.860
"Canned food, Ichiban, ramen, instant ramen noodles."

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.260
"That's why there's heart disease in our family."

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.860
"Yeah."

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:08.000
"And we're so proud of the fact that we're like #2, second to Hawaii,

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:10.840
in the consumption of SPAM. Yeah."

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:11.800
"We have SPAM cook-offs."

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.440
"Teriyaki SPAM, garlic SPAM, spicy SPAM, jalapeño SPAM.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.900
SPAM with cheese."

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.300
"In the stores during Christmas, they do SPAM Christmas tree installations."

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.240
"And food you buy from the store is not cheap."

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.200
"It's like $9 for a gallon of milk. $7, $8 for butter."

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.520
"And why is food so expensive?"

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.240
"The Jones Act. [laughs] Importing."

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.860
The Jones Act says that only U.S. ships can transport goods between U.S. ports,

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.080
making shipping really expensive to places like Puerto Rico, Hawaii and Guam.

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.060
And because 90% of the food here is imported, that additional cost is a real burden

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:50.780
for the people who live on the island.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.860
"Why do you guys find it so important to build a movement around sustainable food?"

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.080
"We've been so indoctrinated to believe that our resources come from somewhere else.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.600
But they're here. They've always been here.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:09.200
Our food independence is our political independence.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.440
It is the one thing most people are afraid of losing."

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:19.200
It was incredibly inspiring to meet so many young Chamorros who are reclaiming their food traditions

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.580
and culture.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.220
With the history of colonization,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.920
occupation and militarization,

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:29.260
Chamorro people on Guam have been stripped of so much of their land,

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:31.320
traditions and autonomy.

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.020
But they continue to survive,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:37.860
and some are determined to take back their island altogether.

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:43.520
"Hey guys, I want to introduce you to our incredibly talented animator, Marisa."

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.500
"Hafa adai. I'm Chamorro, so working on this series meant a lot to me.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.220
Please share with your friends and don't forget to subscribe to Untold America."
