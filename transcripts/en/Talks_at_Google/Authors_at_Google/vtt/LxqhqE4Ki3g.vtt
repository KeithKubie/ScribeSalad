00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.800
SPEAKER: We have
Olivia and Judah here.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.900
Olivia wrote the New
York Times best selling

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.280
book called "Charisma Myth."

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.590
If you haven't read
it, it's amazing.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.760
And Judah works for Berkeley's
Haas Business School,

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.120
and also works at
[? Stardex. ?] And they recently

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.860
wrote a book called "The
Net and the Butterfly"

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.980
to help you work on
your creative process.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.570
So without any further ado,
let's welcome them to Google.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.045
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.470
JUDAH POLLACK: Thank you.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.470
So when we started doing
research for this book,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.560
we came upon this
really wild pattern.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.590
And so-- this is Leo Szilard.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.830
He went to a lecture in the
late '30s about nuclear physics,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.570
and as he was walking
across the street,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.390
literally in mid-stride,
he had this realization

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.670
about how he could
start a nuclear chain

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.220
reaction using fission.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.480
Then we get Henri Poincare--

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.920
how'd I do, how'd I do?

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.224
Henri Poincare.

00:01:03.224 --> 00:01:05.099
Olivia's native French
speaker, so every time

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.690
I come upon a French
word, it's a nightmare.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:07.981
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: It kills me.

00:01:07.981 --> 00:01:09.850
JUDAH POLLACK:
So, he was working

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.670
on an incredibly difficult
series of math functions,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.710
and one morning as he
was getting on a bus

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.720
to go to a conference--
he remembers this very

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.330
distinctly-- he put his foot
on the step, the first step

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.000
of the bus, and
suddenly, it came to him.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.920
He knew what his answer was.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.020
So then we come to
Nikola Tesla, who

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.270
was trying to work on a
functioning alternating

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.500
current generator.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.460
He's walking through a
park with his friends

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.025
when suddenly, he
realizes exactly how he's

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:34.650
going to do it.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.250
He needs one of the
engines to rotate

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:38.470
in the opposite direction
from the other two

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.070
that are going to be
part of the generator.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.740
This also brings
us to Heisenber--

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.250
Heisenberg, sorry.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.550
For those of you who are fans--

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.190
if you type-- if you now type
Heisenberg into the Google

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.800
search engine,
that's what you get.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.730
He has now eclipsed Werner.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.560
Walter has eclipsed Werner.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.360
Werner Heisenberg
has a conversation

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.520
with Niels Bohr in
Copenhagen, late night,

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.314
walking through a
park, what happens?

00:01:59.314 --> 00:02:00.730
He's like, can the
universe really

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.380
be as strange as I think it is?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.510
He comes up with the
uncertainty principle.

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:05.840
This just keeps happening.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.570
Godel and Einstein,
famous for taking

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.789
walks together in
Princeton at the Institute

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.890
for Advanced Study.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.740
Darwin had something
called the sand walk.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.710
What he would do is he would
start at the corner there,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.780
and he'd put a couple of
stones, he'd stack them.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.250
And he'd walk the
sand walk while he

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.708
thought about the
problem, and he'd

00:02:22.708 --> 00:02:24.550
knock a stone off every lap.

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.830
And he knew, he's like, this
is a three stone problem,

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.330
this is a six stone problem.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.790
But he would walk his
way to the answer.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.010
Same thing with Tchaikovsky,
three hour walks,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.330
every afternoon.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.860
And then we get
Emmanuel Kant, who

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.154
it is said you could set
your watch by his walks

00:02:38.154 --> 00:02:39.820
because he'd walk
around the town square

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.230
the same time every day.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.630
You keep going back in
history, it keeps showing up.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.670
Aristotle, who founded
a school, and they

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.050
were known as the peripatetics.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.710
Why?

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:50.424
Because they walked around
as they philosophized.

00:02:50.424 --> 00:02:52.840
And then, of course, we had
the famous story of Archimedes

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.480
who's stepping into the tub,
watches the water displacement,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.430
and suddenly
realizes, this is how

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.430
I'm going to figure out if the
crown is solid gold or not,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.850
by checking its density.

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.630
Something very
strange is going on,

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.509
but this story keeps
happening over and over,

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:07.800
and it's not just with walking.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.240
It happens with sleep.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.910
So this is Dmitri Mendeleev
who spent three years working

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.640
on a chemistry textbook, driven
crazy that he couldn't put it

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.510
into more order.

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.280
And during a
feverish nap, woke up

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.140
with a picture of
this in his head.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.610
Wrote it down as
fast as he could.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.900
Who's in there?

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.680
Oh, you're going
to hate me again.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.630
August-- are you going
to make me do it?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.750
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Go.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.062
JUDAH POLLACK: Kekule?

00:03:34.062 --> 00:03:35.020
How'd I do?

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.575
No?

00:03:35.575 --> 00:03:36.075
Nightmare.

00:03:36.075 --> 00:03:36.600
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
That's fine, go ahead.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.891
JUDAH POLLACK: We're moving on.

00:03:37.891 --> 00:03:40.602
So, chemist, German
chemist, 1800s.

00:03:40.602 --> 00:03:42.810
Everybody's trying to figure
out the shape of benzene

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:43.309
at the time.

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:44.280
Nobody can do it.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.770
He has a dream of a snake
eating its own tail,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.650
and suddenly realizes
that benzene is a ring.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.590
This literally creates
structural organic chemistry,

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.700
which creates the tar
and dye industries,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.480
it creates the
pharmaceutical industries.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.460
You ever wondered why so many
pharmaceutical companies are

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.050
German, it's because
he was German

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.020
and started his
first lab in Bonn.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.020
Ramanujan, famous numbers
theorist from India.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.960
Used to say that the goddess
would write the equations

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.790
on his tongue in his
dreams, and so he'd

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.400
wake up with stuff like this.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.019
Finally, Salvador Dali.

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.149
Now, he knew exactly what
he was doing with sleep.

00:04:19.149 --> 00:04:21.339
He would sit down in a
straight backed chair,

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.490
and he would hang his arm over
the side holding a metal key

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.990
with a metal plate underneath.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.030
And as he dozed off,
he would drop the key,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.988
and the key would hit
the plate, make a rattle,

00:04:29.988 --> 00:04:32.710
wake him up, and as soon as he
woke up, he'd start drawing.

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.040
And we all know what those
drawings ended up looking like.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.200
So here we have all
of these geniuses who

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.590
are accessing walking and
sleeping in different ways

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.326
to come up with these
amazing breakthroughs.

00:04:44.326 --> 00:04:45.700
What is it that
they figured out?

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.740
What did they know?

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.490
And as another example,
I want to tell you

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.255
that when I was
showering this morning,

00:04:50.255 --> 00:04:51.880
thinking about this
stuff, coming here,

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.216
I suddenly realized I
wanted to show you all this.

00:04:55.216 --> 00:04:57.184
[CHEERING AND YELLING ON VIDEO]

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:10.770
I'm going to come back to that.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.353
I'm going to tell you why I want
to show you that in a minute.

00:05:13.353 --> 00:05:16.530
It's not just because it's
really funny, which it is.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.470
We have the capacity
to know so much.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.150
When we look up at
the stars, we're

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.800
amazed at how many
stars there are.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.280
We're amazed at the sheer
immensity of the universe

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.370
and our place in it.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.360
But the reality is that
when we look up at the sky,

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.780
that's how much we're
actually seeing.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.680
We are not truly aware
of how much is out there.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.230
We're not truly aware how
much more we could see,

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:44.160
and the same is true of how
we access our own brains.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.160
We are not aware
of just how much

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.950
we have the capacity to do.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.640
And what we wrote about in this
book is not only what is this

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.770
physical mechanism inside
everyone's brains--

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.900
and I want to be
clear, it's everyone's.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.730
It's not just geniuses.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:02.340
The geniuses have the same
exact physical structures

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.120
in their brain that
every one of you has.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.620
But it's a question
of accessing it.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.570
It's a question of trusting it.

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:10.153
And so what we're
going to do is we're

00:06:10.153 --> 00:06:12.500
going to talk a lot about
tools, because the thing

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.479
about breakthroughs,
creativity, innovation

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:15.770
is there are a lot of theories.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.660
And people lay out theories all
the time, but this is a craft.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.640
This is like an artisan's craft.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.730
And just like artisans,
there are tools,

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.800
and you have to practice
with those tools

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.550
in order to gain mastery.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:32.360
And that's really what we
were interested in this book.

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.335
So to explain what the
process is in your brain,

00:06:35.335 --> 00:06:37.460
we made a short animation
that we want to show you.

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.500
And the story we're going
to tell you is true.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.750
And everything going on
inside the brain is also true.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.620
JUDAH POLLACK (ON
VIDEO): Florida, 1965.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.230
The Rolling Stones are
on their first US tour,

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.660
but they're not the
Rolling Stones yet.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.640
They're about as popular
as Herman's Hermits.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.200
What they're in need of is a
breakthrough hit, a number one

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:05.190
song, and no one knows it
more than Keith Richards.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.410
One night in his
motel room, Richards

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:09.660
was trying to write that song.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.465
So what's going on
inside his brain

00:07:11.465 --> 00:07:14.530
while he's attempting to
have this breakthrough?

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:17.970
This is the executive of
Keith Richards's brain.

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:22.410
It's focused, on task, and
has a goal; write a hit song.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:25.860
There's just one problem, it's
not very good at breakthroughs

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.180
by itself.

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.810
See, the executive
network is great

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.659
when you need to make a
list or complete a project,

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:33.450
but when it comes to
having a breakthrough,

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:34.770
it needs some help.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:37.200
That night, Richards
fell asleep.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.630
And no longer on
task, his executive

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.495
went to talk to another network
that lies deeper in the brain.

00:07:43.495 --> 00:07:45.120
Now what we're about
to show you is not

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.680
unique to Keith Richards.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.300
You have the same exact
room in your brain.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:53.220
We all do, we just
don't access it enough.

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.560
This is your genius lounge.

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.870
About 10 different
brain regions in here,

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.250
all hanging out, talking.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:03.750
There's Mozart, Leonardo da
Vinci, Marie Curie, Einstein.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.220
Welcome to the
part of your brain

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.080
that's working on
stuff when you don't

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.150
think you're working on stuff.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:13.300
That night, Richards's executive
walked in and said, "Quiet!

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:16.140
All right, everyone, we
need to breakthrough hit.

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:17.820
Now go."

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.790
The executive went and busied
itself with something mindless,

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.650
in this case,
sleep, but it can be

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:26.460
doing the dishes or the
laundry or taking a shower.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:28.170
Meanwhile, the geniuses
started sharing

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.690
all kinds of information
from art to music

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.220
to childhood memories.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:35.400
This was the sum total of
Keith Richards' experience

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.200
and knowledge,
and that combining

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.990
created his intuition.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.159
It created a breakthrough.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:43.770
Richards woke up in the middle
of the night and began to play.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.130
[GUITAR MUSIC]

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.380
That was how the Rolling Stones
got their breakthrough hit

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.020
"Satisfaction."

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.370
But it is not just
Keith Richards.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.150
We all have an executive and
a genius lounge in our brains.

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.160
The key to having
more breakthroughs

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.275
is learning how to switch
between the two modes.

00:09:13.192 --> 00:09:14.480
JUDAH POLLACK: All right.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.000
That was me doing
the voice work,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.710
and I'm going to pick that
up as a second job, if I can.

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.042
That literally is what
happens in your brain

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:25.250
when you have a breakthrough.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.624
That is literally where you
go when you're more creative.

00:09:27.624 --> 00:09:30.350
I'm sure all of you have had
moments when you were on a run,

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:32.450
when you were just
spacing out during a walk,

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.520
when you were in the
shower, and suddenly you

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:36.440
just realize something.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.170
And the reason it works is
because your executive mode,

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:40.730
the part in the
front of your brain

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.188
that takes care of
everything, that

00:09:42.188 --> 00:09:44.930
gets you places on time,
that finishes projects,

00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:46.229
it has to go quiet.

00:09:46.229 --> 00:09:48.770
But it can't-- it doesn't just
go quiet if you tell it to, it

00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:50.180
gets annoyed if you do that.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.870
So you have to fake it out.

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.330
You have to give it a goal.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:54.947
We're going to
walk to the store.

00:09:54.947 --> 00:09:56.030
Now the executive's happy.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:57.290
We're going to
finish the dishes,

00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:58.480
we're going to take a shower.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.630
The executive's
like great, I have

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:00.879
something I'm going to finish.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:03.260
Thank goodness, I'm so
happy this is the case.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.420
And it's sort of-- but
it's kind of mindless.

00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.235
You don't concentrate
hard on it.

00:10:07.235 --> 00:10:07.640
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Judah?

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.180
JUDAH POLLACK: Yes.

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.763
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
If you're wondering

00:10:09.763 --> 00:10:12.350
what we mean by "if you tell
the executive to go quiet,

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.931
it gets annoyed," how many
of you have tried meditation?

00:10:15.931 --> 00:10:16.430
Right.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:19.160
How many of you have
experienced the monkey mind?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.120
Exactly, so you know
what we're talking about.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.570
That's what happens when you
try to tell the executive

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.280
to go quiet.

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.032
You're welcome.

00:10:26.032 --> 00:10:26.990
JUDAH POLLACK: And so--

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:29.960
but if you give it this
kind of mindless task, what

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.850
happens is power,
literally, power

00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:35.030
reroutes from the executive
and goes to this genius lounge,

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.130
this default mode network.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:39.500
And it's like the espresso
machine gets fired up,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.390
and all the different
parts of the network

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:42.910
start drinking coffee.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:44.160
And they start getting jazzed.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.035
And the different parts
of this network, they

00:10:46.035 --> 00:10:48.380
encompass so many various parts.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:50.960
You have your own
personal memories.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.420
You have your error prediction
and your future prediction.

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.250
You have your sense of
empathy, trying to figure out

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:56.750
how somebody else is feeling.

00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:59.180
You have your own sense of
self, your metanarrative that's

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.510
moving through this.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.300
You have your inferior
parietal lobes,

00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:05.310
which is all the physical
sensation coming into you.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:07.820
It goes on and on, the
sheer number of things

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:09.380
that this network is engaged in.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:12.140
And what it does when
you're on some sort

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.720
of random little task, is it
starts mixing and matching

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.890
information.

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.320
It starts playing around, as
if you had a pile of LEGOs.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.550
And it's just making all
these LEGOs together,

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.050
and then holding
them up and saying,

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.150
is this a brilliant idea?

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:24.996
Is this a brilliant idea?

00:11:24.996 --> 00:11:26.870
Now, one of the keys to
this is that it's not

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.670
that the executive
plays no role.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:30.590
As you saw in the
video, the geniuses

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.242
keep looking to the executive.

00:11:32.242 --> 00:11:34.700
They're like, hey, we came up
with this, what do you think?

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.940
The executive is actually
saying yes or no.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.550
And so at some point,
your geniuses come up

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:42.740
with something really good,
your executive says yes,

00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.140
and that's when it enters
your level of awareness.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.510
That's your aha moment.

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:49.830
Now, the science kind
of stops at the moment,

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:53.480
at how does your brain
determine what's a good idea

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.950
and what's not a good idea?

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.570
How does it know to wake you up?

00:11:56.570 --> 00:11:58.850
We don't know yet,
but we do know

00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:00.620
that this is what's happening.

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.480
And there are certain
things that we all

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:07.130
can do to capitalize on
this natural ability.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:10.230
And the first one is plasticity.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:13.189
So the reason I
showed you this video

00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:14.480
was for a very specific reason.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.563
I'll show it to you again.

00:12:15.563 --> 00:12:17.838
Watch the defense.

00:12:17.838 --> 00:12:19.754
[CHEERING AND YELLING ON VIDEO]

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.290
JUDAH POLLACK: The
defense just stands there.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.160
They just look at the
quarterback, dumbfounded.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.210
And the reason it works is
because what's happening

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.690
is not within their
realm of what's possible.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:42.510
They don't notice it,
they don't expect it,

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.180
and so they can't
think of what to do.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:47.220
He literally has the
ball and is walking

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:50.910
by seven people who could
tackle him at any moment,

00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:54.810
and nobody moves because
they can't put it together.

00:12:54.810 --> 00:12:57.090
That is what plasticity
allows us to do.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:59.640
Brain plasticity is
our ability to build

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:04.040
new neural connections, to
understand new thoughts.

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:05.790
To give you an idea
of what plasticity is,

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:06.789
I want to show you this.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:12.800
So this is a video by
Drew Berry, who does

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.270
amazing biological animations.

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:18.090
Highly recommend you go check
out his stuff, it's brilliant.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.560
And here he's got
a single neuron.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.260
And when you're watching
happen is the axon--

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.620
or, I mean, the stoma, or
the body, the big bulb there,

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.592
is what's sort of giving
out pulses of electricity.

00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:31.050
There's new research
out, actually,

00:13:31.050 --> 00:13:33.300
that it's not just the
body that does that,

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.130
but we don't even get
into that right now.

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:36.972
And we're moving along
to the dendrites.

00:13:36.972 --> 00:13:39.180
These are the parts of the
brain that just branch out

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:40.930
like a river, and the
parts of the neurons

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.400
that just go out
and out and out.

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.240
And along them, you
have these little heads,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.990
these little buds.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:46.780
And on the top of
these buds, that's

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:49.800
where you have neurotransmitter
receptors, the places that

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.690
accept things like serotonin,
dopamine, neuro epinephrine.

00:13:54.690 --> 00:14:00.145
The thing you need to realize is
this is not a static situation.

00:14:00.145 --> 00:14:01.770
What you're seeing
right here is you're

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:04.310
watching a new
neurotransmitter receptor being

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:08.550
born for the first time, and
now, all of a sudden, there

00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:12.727
is a new way for the neurons
to connect to one another.

00:14:12.727 --> 00:14:14.310
And because there's
a new way for them

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.990
to connect to one
another, there's

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:18.499
a new thought that can happen.

00:14:18.499 --> 00:14:20.790
Because that's one of the
most important things for you

00:14:20.790 --> 00:14:21.840
to understand.

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.660
Your thoughts are not
chemical, your thoughts

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.170
are not electrical, your
thoughts are structural.

00:14:28.170 --> 00:14:33.090
Your brain is literally building
new neurotransmitter receptors

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.950
every millisecond.

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:37.020
And in doing that,
you have the ability

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.960
to build new connections, and
having the ability to build

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.960
new connections gives you the
ability to have a new thought.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:48.580
Basically, messenger RNA sends
a message to transfer RNA.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.666
This is transfer RNA.

00:14:49.666 --> 00:14:50.540
Look at the very top.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.070
You see the ACC?

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:53.550
Those are amino acids.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:57.510
This little factory stacks amino
acids one on top of the other,

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.020
and then when it's
done, it cuts them off.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.260
And then this amazing,
magical thing happens.

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.060
The protein folds.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.159
I'm sure you've heard of this.

00:15:07.159 --> 00:15:08.950
In this case, and what
we're talking about,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.240
these proteins fold and form
new neurotransmitter receptors.

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.210
So it's our ability to do
that that makes us plastic.

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:20.920
Your brain is structural.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.980
You're building the
actual infrastructure

00:15:23.980 --> 00:15:25.519
to have a new thought.

00:15:25.519 --> 00:15:27.310
And so one of the first
things that you all

00:15:27.310 --> 00:15:29.790
have to get better at, that
everyone has to get better at,

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.080
is getting more
practiced at doing this.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.520
So people who tell
themselves, I'm not creative,

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.450
I don't think of these things,
I'm not that sort of person--

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:40.856
that is equivalent to sitting
on the couch for two years

00:15:40.856 --> 00:15:42.730
and then somebody tells
you to do 10 push ups

00:15:42.730 --> 00:15:46.990
and you can't, and you say
I guess I'm just weak now.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:49.054
I'm just forever out of
shape, it's hopeless.

00:15:49.054 --> 00:15:50.470
Now, you know
that's not the case.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.500
You know you just need
to work out and get fit.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.840
The same is true
about your own ability

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.890
to have a breakthrough,
about your own ability

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.690
to be creative.

00:15:58.690 --> 00:16:03.080
We have become neuro
couch potatoes.

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.820
We do the same
things over and over,

00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.800
and when we do the same
things over and over,

00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:10.340
we don't challenge our brains
to build new neurotransmitter

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:13.130
receptors, which means we
can't build a new thought.

00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.600
And that's why we get stuck.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.210
That's why many of us end up
like the defense on that team.

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.910
Something new has happened,
and we can't process it,

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:23.940
we don't know what it
is, and it walks by us.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.120
This is what it's like when
you lack neuroplasticity,

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:30.005
but you're trying to come
up with a new thought.

00:16:30.005 --> 00:16:31.380
And there are
tools that can help

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.200
you actually get to something
that's more like this.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:36.450
And so that's what this is
really about, is the tools.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:39.840
It's about changing your
neurons from this to this.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.570
You want all those branches,
you want all that connectivity.

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:46.040
That's what you're looking for.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.370
What do you think this is?

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.060
Don't be shy, you've
no way of knowing,

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:53.896
so just shout stuff out.

00:16:53.896 --> 00:16:54.780
AUDIENCE: Paint?

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.250
JUDAH POLLACK: Paint.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.314
AUDIENCE: Fabric?

00:16:57.314 --> 00:16:58.230
JUDAH POLLACK: Fabric.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.150
See that-- feel that push?

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.960
Feel that push?

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.992
That's like trying to do a push
up when you're out of shape.

00:17:09.992 --> 00:17:10.780
AUDIENCE: Smoke.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.369
JUDAH POLLACK: Smoke.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.410
AUDIENCE: Colored liquid.

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:14.659
JUDAH POLLACK: Colored liquid.

00:17:17.636 --> 00:17:18.619
AUDIENCE: Turbulence.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.702
JUDAH POLLACK: Turbulence.

00:17:19.702 --> 00:17:20.660
AUDIENCE: Mold.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.170
JUDAH POLLACK: What was it?

00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:21.880
AUDIENCE: Mold.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.713
JUDAH POLLACK: Mold.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.430
So this is ink drops in water.

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.726
And you were getting there,
you are all in and around it.

00:17:33.726 --> 00:17:35.850
But now that I've told you
it's ink drops in water,

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.100
you're looking at it
again and your brain

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.890
is actually forming a new
set of neural connections

00:17:40.890 --> 00:17:43.710
to make that into a
memory, to understand

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:45.600
that that's what that is.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.425
You've broken open
into a new space.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.779
Exposing ourselves to things
we don't know, to things

00:17:52.779 --> 00:17:55.070
we don't understand, to things
we don't see a lot, that

00:17:55.070 --> 00:17:59.750
is literally one of the greatest
ways to create neuroplasticity.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:04.450
This is one of our
favorites, Erik Weihenmayer--

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:05.900
eh?

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:08.660
OK, you'll let it go?

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:10.550
He has climbed the
seven tallest mountains

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:12.027
on all seven continents.

00:18:12.027 --> 00:18:14.360
There's just one funny thing,
as if that weren't enough.

00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.250
He's blind.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:18.540
So how does he do this?

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.830
How does he possibly
climb this mountain?

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:23.180
Something called the brain port.

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:24.380
See this little thing?

00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:28.181
He puts that on
his tongue, then it

00:18:28.181 --> 00:18:29.680
is connected to
these glasses, where

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.030
you see a camera on the front.

00:18:31.030 --> 00:18:32.980
The camera takes in
the light signals,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:36.580
and it becomes
electrical impulses that

00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.800
are signaled to his tongue.

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.579
The tongue signals
those into his brain.

00:18:41.579 --> 00:18:43.870
Because the person who invented
this, Paul Bach-y-rita,

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:48.480
said we don't see with our
eyes, we see with our brains.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.230
Our eyes just happen
to take in the light,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:51.520
but if we can figure
out another way

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.320
to take in the light
signals, our brains

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:55.445
will figure out a way to
see because our brains are

00:18:55.445 --> 00:18:56.256
so plastic.

00:18:56.256 --> 00:18:58.630
Because we can create so many
new connections, and little

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.960
by little, he learned to read
the signals from his tongue,

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:04.590
and he could actually
start to see,

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:07.870
even though there was nothing
coming through his eyes.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.900
Another story we love is a young
woman in China, 24-yeard-old,

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.800
walks into the
hospital, kind of dizzy.

00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:16.411
They do they do a CAT scan,
she has no cerebellum.

00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:18.910
She was born without one, it
was full of liquid in her head.

00:19:18.910 --> 00:19:21.460
She shouldn't have been
able to ever walk, much less

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.764
hold down a job, function.

00:19:22.764 --> 00:19:24.430
But the other parts
of her brain started

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.070
to take on these
other abilities.

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:29.600
Our ability to be plastic
is almost never ending,

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.430
it's astounding.

00:19:30.430 --> 00:19:32.970
We just need to actually
work the muscle,

00:19:32.970 --> 00:19:36.110
and it's incredibly important
that we work the muscle.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.590
A number of things that
we like to suggest,

00:19:38.590 --> 00:19:41.380
come to work one day dressed
completely differently than you

00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:42.580
ever do.

00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:45.580
If you're a dress down
sort of person, like I am,

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.400
wear a suit and a
tie, fancy shoes.

00:19:48.400 --> 00:19:51.277
First of all, the fabric will
move against you differently,

00:19:51.277 --> 00:19:53.110
and it will give different
physical impulses

00:19:53.110 --> 00:19:55.910
to your brain, which goes right
into your default network.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.368
The other thing
that will happen is

00:19:57.368 --> 00:19:59.080
people will respond
to you differently.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:01.413
You're going to get a whole
different set of information

00:20:01.413 --> 00:20:04.140
from people as they react
in these different ways.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.640
And you're going to-- you're
just going to take this all in.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.490
If you're a woman and you tend
to wear heels and dresses,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:10.930
wear pants and a
pair of sneakers,

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.150
or vice versa on both
the men and the women.

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.650
Just change it up.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:17.050
Another one that I like to
do is borrow somebody else's

00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.850
playlist, that you
don't know what it is,

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:20.650
and just listen
to it for the day.

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:23.570
Just the songs that come up,
the way they make you feel,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:24.987
what you're
experiencing with it.

00:20:24.987 --> 00:20:27.070
We like to talk about
eating things you ordinarily

00:20:27.070 --> 00:20:28.270
never eat.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:30.040
Because the brain
signals are new,

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.770
you have to sort of process
what is this new thing?

00:20:32.770 --> 00:20:35.020
This one is really
difficult, especially

00:20:35.020 --> 00:20:36.850
given the political
situation right now,

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:40.150
but read political magazines
you ordinarily wouldn't read,

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:42.700
listen to talk radio you
ordinarily wouldn't talk to.

00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.680
It might not be worth it
from the stress level,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.052
and we understand that.

00:20:46.052 --> 00:20:47.510
But it's another
way of just taking

00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:49.470
in totally different
information.

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:52.540
Or watch movies you
would never watch.

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.611
Read a book you
would never read.

00:20:54.611 --> 00:20:56.110
Get into a conversation
with someone

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:57.960
you'd never get into
a conversation to,

00:20:57.960 --> 00:21:00.520
and just take in things
that are brand new.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.830
When you go to
home tonight, take

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:05.160
a completely different
route if you can,

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.640
and just notice what's new.

00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.530
Notice what's different.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.390
Change up your routine.

00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:13.090
Routine is the
death of plasticity.

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:15.590
You're wanting to just change
it up and see what's going on,

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:17.860
see what you can
bring in that's new.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.520
I suggest all of you go
and visit Olivia if you can

00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:23.950
and hang out with her
chickens and her bees

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.020
because you probably
don't do that very often.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.600
And watching chickens is
actually kind of fascinating.

00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.000
They call it chicken TV,
and you can just watch them,

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.070
but they behave in a way
you just don't notice,

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.162
you just don't see.

00:21:34.162 --> 00:21:35.620
This is one of the
reasons you feel

00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.953
more alive when you go on
vacation, because everything's

00:21:37.953 --> 00:21:38.619
new.

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:39.910
And it's popping in your brain.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.560
When the plasticity's
going, you feel it.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.150
It fundamentally feels
good and feels different.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.910
Another piece about
this is new information.

00:21:49.910 --> 00:21:52.850
You want to take in
things you ordinarily

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:58.860
would never hear about, would
never see, would never do.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.250
So try a sport you've
never tried, if you're more

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.570
physically oriented.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:03.890
Ride a dirt bike.

00:22:03.890 --> 00:22:07.370
Go mountain biking in
Moab, go on a trapeze--

00:22:07.370 --> 00:22:09.770
be careful, I once hurt
myself terribly on a trapeze--

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:12.050
but take in all of
these different pieces,

00:22:12.050 --> 00:22:14.600
because the physical
reality that you engage in

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.700
is going straight into
your default network,

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:19.179
and it's causing all kinds
of new things to pop.

00:22:19.179 --> 00:22:21.470
But one of the reasons new
information is so incredibly

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:24.200
important is because it's
this other element to the way

00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:26.810
that our default network
works, and we couldn't get

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:30.110
into it in the animation because
it was a little too complex,

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:31.562
but here's what happens.

00:22:31.562 --> 00:22:33.270
Right now, you're
paying attention to me,

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:35.330
or at least I hope you're
paying attention to me,

00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:38.199
and you're creating
memories in your brain.

00:22:38.199 --> 00:22:39.740
And what your
hippocampus does, which

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.060
is what's in charge of
creating your memories,

00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.960
is it takes all this information
and kind of puts it on a shelf,

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:48.230
and it waits to encode it
as longer term memories.

00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:51.860
And then when you're off task,
when you're not really focused,

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.295
your hippocampus starts
to form these memories.

00:22:54.295 --> 00:22:56.420
Meanwhile, you're off task,
so your default network

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.410
is also activated.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.270
All of a sudden,
your hippocampus

00:23:01.270 --> 00:23:02.590
does a very strange thing.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.990
It takes random shards
and combinations

00:23:04.990 --> 00:23:07.990
of these new memories
and it throws them,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.774
like little sparks, into
your default network.

00:23:10.774 --> 00:23:12.940
So your default network has
all of this information,

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.640
kind of like building a fire,
and then your hippocampus

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.540
throws the new information
in as a spark to light it.

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:21.640
So if you don't have
new information,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.440
your default network,
your genius lounge,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.090
just keeps spinning
on the same stuff.

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:28.030
It can't really bust
through to something new.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:29.890
This is one of the
reasons very often

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.230
people who have
breakthroughs do their work

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.600
and then also have
some kind of hobby.

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:37.030
They have something else
they're really interested in

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:39.400
because that brings in
the new information.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.200
That starts getting
things to bang

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:43.240
into each other in
new and novel ways,

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:45.560
in ways they weren't expecting.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.580
So if all you do
is work, it's going

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.104
to be that much harder to have
that creative breakthrough

00:23:51.104 --> 00:23:53.020
because you want to bring
that new information

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:56.650
in from somewhere else, from
something else, something

00:23:56.650 --> 00:23:58.180
that's just different.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.450
So how do you access it?

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.640
How do you actually
get into this mode?

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.200
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Judah, if
I can step in for a second.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.010
JUDAH POLLACK: Please.

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:07.760
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
One of the ways

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:10.160
that we like to explain the
importance of plasticity

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.590
is if you look at
a martial artist.

00:24:13.590 --> 00:24:17.140
So, say someone who is doing
an actual, useful martial arts,

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.120
like Brazilian jiu jitsu
and not some sissy practice

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.400
like karate.

00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.059
You know that one--

00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:26.600
I'm slightly biased-- you know
that there's one thing that is

00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.234
the actual techniques-- what are
the moves, how can you roll--

00:24:29.234 --> 00:24:30.900
and then something
completely different,

00:24:30.900 --> 00:24:32.480
which is the physical
conditioning.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.140
Plasticity is like doing cardio.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.840
The plasticity on its own
won't-- isn't necessarily

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.992
the exact--

00:24:39.992 --> 00:24:42.200
the exercise for plasticity
isn't necessarily the one

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.030
that'll lead you
to breakthrough.

00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:48.650
Just like having a lot
more physical power

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.350
won't necessarily get
you to win on the mat.

00:24:51.350 --> 00:24:54.770
I was regularly tied into knots
by my sensei, who was a shrimp.

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:56.900
Was about this big.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.930
He could take on an 85
kilo guy without a problem.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:09.120
But it's part of what will make
you better at the final result.

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.340
So the same way you
do cardio, regardless

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.440
of which end sport
you're going to do,

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.600
you want to get
better at plasticity,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.560
because it's a good conditioning
to then use the breakthrough

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.340
tools.

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.920
Am I making any sense?

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:26.450
Yeah.

00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:28.550
Please, please, please,
jump in, ask questions.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:31.430
If you have
objections, raise them.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.334
We really encourage the
debate in the moment.

00:25:34.334 --> 00:25:36.500
There might or might not
be a Q&amp;A period at the end,

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:38.180
so take advantage of it.

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.630
All yours.

00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:42.597
JUDAH POLLACK: Objections?

00:25:42.597 --> 00:25:44.180
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat his question?

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:45.200
JUDAH POLLACK: Yes.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.190
So the question was what are
the good contrasts in terms

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.650
of your work versus a hobby?

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.360
What are good ways to
create that differentiation

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.440
so that you get the most
out of the new information

00:25:57.440 --> 00:25:59.900
to get the novel ideas.

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.470
And-- so there are two things
going on in your question.

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:04.970
Some of the things you suggested
go to what we have up here,

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:05.761
which is accessing.

00:26:05.761 --> 00:26:08.705
So sleep, walking,
these are less hobbies,

00:26:08.705 --> 00:26:10.580
although I like to think
of sleep as a hobby.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:12.200
That's a great idea.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.600
But these are less hobbies
and they're more ways

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.490
to access your network.

00:26:16.490 --> 00:26:19.280
They're way-- they're
doorways into that sort

00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.950
of mindless state, where
you're sort of floating

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.470
and you're not paying too
much attention to anything.

00:26:24.470 --> 00:26:27.110
Then there's an actual
hobby, where you are focused.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:29.870
So actual hobbies
can be anything.

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:31.430
Woodworking is great.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.160
Watching movies is
great, or reading books.

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:37.292
Cooking, rock climbing, cycling.

00:26:37.292 --> 00:26:39.125
It doesn't really matter,
collecting stamps.

00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:39.440
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:40.546
JUDAH POLLACK: Yes?

00:26:40.546 --> 00:26:42.170
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
I have an objection.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:45.200
Personally, I've always found
that things that are wordless

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.417
are better for the
mind wandering.

00:26:47.417 --> 00:26:49.250
So for example, when
you watch a movie, even

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:51.290
if it's a movie that
you know really well,

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:52.790
the verbal center--

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:55.010
processing center of your
brain is still active.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:57.060
Whereas if you're rock
climbing, if you're--

00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.476
well, if you're
beekeeping, you're

00:26:58.476 --> 00:27:00.530
usually berating yourself
for the many mistakes

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:01.490
you've just done--

00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:05.974
but if you're climbing, if
you're running without music,

00:27:05.974 --> 00:27:07.640
in my experience that
just works better,

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:10.520
because of the
lack of distraction

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.630
from the verbal processor.

00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:14.130
JUDAH POLLACK: And
just to be clear,

00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:17.450
there's no absolute
answers to these things.

00:27:17.450 --> 00:27:19.400
You find your own way.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.320
Because I would turn
around and say my mind

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.710
will wander very often
when I'm reading.

00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:24.360
You ever read the same
paragraph over and over,

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.150
and then you're like oh, I keep
reading the same paragraph?

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.650
It's because you've
mind wandered.

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:31.190
So for some people, absolutely,
the verbal processor completely

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:32.150
gets in the way.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:35.240
For other people, it just
sort of-- it can shut down.

00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:37.702
So you're just looking
for what works for you

00:27:37.702 --> 00:27:39.410
and what interests
you, because you don't

00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:40.970
want it to be a force.

00:27:40.970 --> 00:27:43.100
You want it to be something
that you actually like.

00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.630
But the key is to give it time.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:47.630
Give yourself time
to truly do it.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.000
Give yourself time to
truly learn about it.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.330
Because that's going to create
new and different information

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.010
that can then
combine with the work

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.595
you're doing to show you
novel, new possibilities.

00:27:58.595 --> 00:27:59.872
Does that makes sense?

00:27:59.872 --> 00:28:01.080
AUDIENCE: It does, thank you.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.288
JUDAH POLLACK: You've got it.

00:28:02.288 --> 00:28:04.230
And so, to continue-- oh, yes?

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:06.170
Please.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.170
AUDIENCE: How does
meditation fit into all this?

00:28:08.170 --> 00:28:11.600
JUDAH POLLACK: Oh, the
meditation question.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.590
Excellent question.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.015
I'll start, then you'll--

00:28:16.015 --> 00:28:16.960
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: We
debated in the book

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.466
just how deep to get
into this, because--

00:28:18.466 --> 00:28:18.862
JUDAH POLLACK: [LAUGH]

00:28:18.862 --> 00:28:20.486
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
No, seriously, there

00:28:20.486 --> 00:28:23.530
are some dark sides to many
practices of meditation,

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:24.630
and so--

00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:26.380
JUDAH POLLACK: So, meditation.

00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:29.140
Ironically, you would think
meditation would put you

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:30.760
into that kind of state.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.340
However, the majority
of meditation practice

00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.800
actually quiet your
default network.

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.670
They actually make
it happen less.

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.170
One of the reasons is because
there's a part of your default

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:44.440
network that is all about
your meta awareness,

00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.570
so it's all about what
do I think about myself?

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.736
You ever get caught in a
loop, thinking bad thoughts

00:28:48.736 --> 00:28:49.420
about yourself?

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:51.029
That's your default network.

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:52.570
This is one of the
reasons depression

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.319
and creativity get
connected very often

00:28:54.319 --> 00:28:56.110
because it's the same
network in your brain

00:28:56.110 --> 00:28:58.600
responsible for both.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.850
And meditation
quiets that network,

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:03.050
it can help you with depression.

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:07.070
So at the same time--

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:08.320
JUDAH POLLACK: Caveat warning.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.250
JUDAH POLLACK:
--at the same time,

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.770
the default network
gets strengthened when

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.270
you're in a meditative state.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.094
Literally, your gray
matter thickens.

00:29:17.094 --> 00:29:19.260
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Oh,
that's not where I was going.

00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:21.590
JUDAH POLLACK:
Where are you going?

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:22.570
Please, please.

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:24.120
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: OK.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:27.350
Judah and I have slightly
different approaches to-- well,

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.120
actually a lot of things,
but meditation in particular.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.930
I'm the ruthlessly
pragmatic one in this duo.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:37.080
So the way I look at meditation
is really like a toolbox,

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:40.230
or like a cheeseboard
or something.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:43.190
The same way you wouldn't
use a hammer or a wrench

00:29:43.190 --> 00:29:44.760
for the same
purpose, the same way

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.650
that personally,
I would recommend

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.040
using metta or vipassana
for the same purpose.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.050
It really is the same way
where you talk about yoga.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:57.180
It runs the gamut
from the 180 degrees

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:02.250
Celsius bikram rooms to
the hold the Mountain Pose

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.350
for three days kind of things.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.060
Meditation, for me,
is the same way.

00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:07.170
It's a toolbox.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.766
So it really depends as to
what you're going after.

00:30:09.766 --> 00:30:11.640
And you could be going
for emotional healing,

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.570
you could be going
for internal insight.

00:30:15.570 --> 00:30:18.360
The way I tend to
see it, and there's

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:21.750
a lot of push back, this is just
one personal way of seeing it,

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:26.430
from easiest to
hardest is how much

00:30:26.430 --> 00:30:28.800
sedatives you give
your monkey mind.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.720
So TM, transcendental
meditation,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:33.420
is a really nice entry
point into meditation

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.870
because it gives you what is
direct drugs for the monkey

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:38.490
mind, which is words.

00:30:38.490 --> 00:30:41.730
So you get a mantra to
repeat, and in some traditions

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:43.590
it's considered
sacred and personal,

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.550
in some other
scientific studies,

00:30:45.550 --> 00:30:48.720
it seems that pretty much
any sound that you repeat

00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.040
can have the same effect.

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.950
But you get something
mental to focus on.

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:57.460
In various traditions of
vipassana, of insight,

00:30:57.460 --> 00:31:01.605
you can focus on any object
in meditation, be it the--

00:31:01.605 --> 00:31:02.910
a candle.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:05.850
Your breath is usually
the most portable.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:11.510
For a lot of people like
probably us in this room,

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:16.640
that's the nice, dry,
comfortable work of the mind.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.907
And for a lot of
us, it's easier--

00:31:19.907 --> 00:31:21.740
probably most of us in
Silicon Valley-- it's

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:24.050
easier to work on something
like insight meditation

00:31:24.050 --> 00:31:26.070
because it's all in the mind.

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:29.240
It's a lot easier than the
messy, ugly, uncomfortable work

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:34.220
of the heart, which is the
realm of practices like metta,

00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:34.930
loving kindness.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.240
Tonglen, compassion.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.540
Please don't get into
tonglen until you're

00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:40.010
damn sure you're ready.

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.230
You're taking on the sufferings
of the rest of the world.

00:31:43.230 --> 00:31:44.772
So if you want to
grow your heart,

00:31:44.772 --> 00:31:45.980
you're going to use one tool.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.630
If you want to grow
your plasticity,

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.171
you're going to want
to grow another.

00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:51.710
The caveat I was
going into is there

00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:56.190
are some forms of meditation
that I personally would not

00:31:56.190 --> 00:31:57.430
recommend to beginners.

00:31:57.430 --> 00:31:58.777
Zen is a good example.

00:31:58.777 --> 00:32:01.110
People have been known to go
into schizophrenic episodes

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:02.406
on zen retreats.

00:32:02.406 --> 00:32:04.530
How many of you have ever
gone on a silent retreat?

00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:06.810
Please raise your hands.

00:32:06.810 --> 00:32:07.500
OK.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.041
For those of you who haven't,
please, please, please, please,

00:32:10.041 --> 00:32:11.340
please consider going on one.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:12.923
There are very few
experience of which

00:32:12.923 --> 00:32:16.290
I would say without the
slightest second of hesitation

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:18.420
it's a life changing experience.

00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:21.360
I would say that about
going on a silent retreat.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.730
Those of you have gone, has
this been your experience?

00:32:23.730 --> 00:32:25.239
Please feel free
to say no if not.

00:32:25.239 --> 00:32:26.530
AUDIENCE: That's the way to go.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:27.370
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: OK.

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:29.036
Now, that's an answer,
it's really good.

00:32:29.036 --> 00:32:31.350
I hate silent retreats.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.640
But it's kind of like--

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.250
meditation is training
for your mind.

00:32:37.250 --> 00:32:39.320
It's like going to
the gym for your mind.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.960
And usually by 2/3 of the way
into a meditation retreat,

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:43.610
you are certain that
you are failing,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:45.380
the meditation
practice is failing,

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.140
this whole idea is stupid, and
you want to go home anyway.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.880
And there is a certain
arc that you will

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.580
see your own mind go through.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:54.230
The caveat that I
was going into is

00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:58.400
that meditation can, in
certain circumstances,

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.840
help you through depression.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:03.200
It can also
precipitate depression.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:09.460
So as with any other tool, it's
useful to have good mentors,

00:33:09.460 --> 00:33:12.670
teachers, or-- and they can be
in the form of books, humans,

00:33:12.670 --> 00:33:13.510
it doesn't matter--

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.010
but who can guide
you along the way,

00:33:15.010 --> 00:33:18.460
so you get sure that you don't
get stuck into a vicious cycle

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.130
that through meditation can
actually worsen depression.

00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:24.739
Am I making sense, does anyone
have any questions, comments,

00:33:24.739 --> 00:33:25.530
objections, please?

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:32.044
AUDIENCE: So what you're
saying [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:32.044 --> 00:33:34.210
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Yeah
meditation can in some cases

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.940
worsen depression, especially
if you're on retreat.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.550
AUDIENCE: Yes, but it can
also get you out of it.

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:40.660
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: It can
also get you out of it.

00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.380
There's a fantastic--

00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:42.490
AUDIENCE: The [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:46.480
If it gets you into it and
then gets you out of it,

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.014
that balances the nice result.

00:33:49.014 --> 00:33:50.680
OLIVIA FOX CABANE:
Here you're saying it

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.720
as if it were a single thing.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.160
It's not.

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:56.980
You've got first, a bazillion
different traditions

00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:58.890
of meditation, and
each experience you

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:00.640
have is going to be different.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.370
There is a book that I recommend
very, very, very highly.

00:34:03.370 --> 00:34:06.310
It's called "The Mindful
Way Through Depression."

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:11.650
It is one of the best books
I've seen on those two things,

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:13.187
but there's--

00:34:13.187 --> 00:34:14.770
if you're just
starting to meditation,

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:16.739
get out of your mind
and into your life,

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:21.010
but the classic, the favoritest,
would be "Wherever You Go,

00:34:21.010 --> 00:34:21.973
There You Are."

00:34:21.973 --> 00:34:23.889
And those are all really
good introductions as

00:34:23.889 --> 00:34:27.219
to seeing where your
mind can take you,

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:30.490
and learning to
drop below the mind,

00:34:30.490 --> 00:34:31.989
learning to-- just
because something

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:36.950
is in your head doesn't mean
it has any validity whatsoever.

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:38.380
Yeah?

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.600
OK.

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.440
All yours.

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:41.190
JUDAH POLLACK: OK.

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:46.460
One last thing out
there I was just saying

00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.310
is that it has been
shown to increase

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:52.580
the gray matter in
your default network,

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.122
and increase the connections.

00:34:54.122 --> 00:34:56.330
And so what can happen is,
even though you may not go

00:34:56.330 --> 00:34:59.840
into a mind-wandering
state of creativity while

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.870
in the meditative state,
when you come out,

00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:04.920
you're kind of
charged and ready--

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:05.060
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Now--

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:06.380
JUDAH POLLACK: --to
be stronger with it.

00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:07.580
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Talk
about the gyrification,

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:08.570
it makes you smarter.

00:35:08.570 --> 00:35:09.110
JUDAH POLLACK: Sorry?

00:35:09.110 --> 00:35:11.401
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: Talk about
the gyrification, that it

00:35:11.401 --> 00:35:12.885
makes you stronger and smarter.

00:35:12.885 --> 00:35:14.510
It increases the
folds in certain parts

00:35:14.510 --> 00:35:18.097
of your gray matter, and I
pronounce it gyrification,

00:35:18.097 --> 00:35:18.680
you might not.

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:20.340
JUDAH POLLACK: That's what threw
me off, but it doesn't matter.

00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:20.850
Go.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:22.725
OLIVIA FOX CABANE: We
have slight differences

00:35:22.725 --> 00:35:24.310
in pronunciation,
as you can see.

00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:27.564
And then-- the
complexity of the folding

00:35:27.564 --> 00:35:29.480
in that part of your
brain is directly related

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:33.380
to your rapidity in
processing information.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:34.922
So it literally can
make you smarter.

00:35:34.922 --> 00:35:36.588
You're going to explain
it a lot better.

00:35:36.588 --> 00:35:38.150
JUDAH POLLACK: That sounds good.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:40.110
And so the more--

00:35:40.110 --> 00:35:42.380
the more your neurons
are closer to each other,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:43.530
the more they're wrapped
around each other,

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.070
the more surface area they
can get into contact with--

00:35:46.070 --> 00:35:48.620
kind of the way your genes
are wrapped up in a ball--

00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:51.330
the more chances there are
for the new connections.

00:35:51.330 --> 00:35:53.700
So that's why it can
improve what's going on.

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.130
Again, your brain is structural.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:59.300
So as you as you strengthen
the structure of your brain,

00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.720
you strengthen your ability
to have these breakthroughs.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.470
And so while meditation is
ordinarily not an access point,

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.140
it's a strengthening point, so
it's a plasticity strengthening

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:10.340
point.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.790
The access points are
things like taking naps.

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:16.520
Salvador Dali discovered the
power of the hypnogogic state,

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.320
when you're just falling
asleep and you're

00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.750
in that liminal
in-between space.

00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:22.800
And other people have
discovered the hypnopompic,

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.591
which is when you're
just coming out of it.

00:36:24.591 --> 00:36:27.020
When somebody says sleep
on it, that's a real thing.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.210
Because when you go to
sleep, your default network

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.501
starts working on things and
right as you're waking up,

00:36:31.501 --> 00:36:32.845
it tends to tell you things.

00:36:32.845 --> 00:36:34.970
And so in the book we talk
about Adam Cheyer, who's

00:36:34.970 --> 00:36:36.710
one of the co-founders of Siri.

00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:39.050
And this is just a
general practice of his.

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:43.490
He goes to sleep, focuses on an
idea, specific problem he has,

00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:45.410
and that's using
his executive to say

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.132
this is what we're
working on, and then

00:36:47.132 --> 00:36:48.590
he just allows this
default network

00:36:48.590 --> 00:36:50.195
to do its thing at night.

00:36:50.195 --> 00:36:52.070
And then when he wakes
up, he kind of checks.

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:53.990
He's like, what did it tell me?

00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:56.240
And it usually told him
something, he writes it down.

00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:57.770
He then gets up,
goes to his desk,

00:36:57.770 --> 00:36:59.750
goes back to his
executive network,

00:36:59.750 --> 00:37:01.460
and starts working it out.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.020
And you see this
happen all the time.

00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.900
Einstein famously went
to his friend one day

00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:09.842
after 10 years in 1905, working
on his theories about light

00:37:09.842 --> 00:37:11.300
and simultanaeity
in time, and he's

00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:12.591
like, you know what, I give up.

00:37:12.591 --> 00:37:13.155
I'm done.

00:37:13.155 --> 00:37:14.780
And he went home,
and he went to sleep,

00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.509
and he wakes up, and voila.

00:37:16.509 --> 00:37:18.050
He comes back to
see his friend, he's

00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:19.942
like, I have it,
thank you so much.

00:37:19.942 --> 00:37:21.650
But here's the thing
about breakthroughs.

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.280
That wasn't it.

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.820
He then spends six weeks
with his executive function

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:28.400
writing it all out,
getting it all straight.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.120
So there's this
constant back and forth,

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.430
there's this interplay between
the two that is so important.

00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:36.080
And so when you
access this mode,

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:38.900
you have to also remember to
use your executive to focus you

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.374
on the issue at hand.

00:37:40.374 --> 00:37:42.290
To say OK, this is what
I want to think about,

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:43.550
this is what I'm going to do.

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.929
Now I'm going to go take a walk.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.220
Now I'm going to go take a nap.

00:37:46.220 --> 00:37:47.512
Now I'm going to go for a swim.

00:37:47.512 --> 00:37:49.219
Now I'm just going to
sit in this hammock

00:37:49.219 --> 00:37:50.960
and let myself just
sort of wander off.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.835
Or I'm going to pick up this
book, but I'm not going to be--

00:37:52.835 --> 00:37:55.120
I'm not going to be focused
on like finishing the chapter.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.870
I'm just going to let
myself read the book

00:37:56.870 --> 00:38:00.440
and see if I kind of wander off,
see if something just comes out

00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:00.950
of it.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.900
Or, if you're very
good at meditating,

00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:06.230
sit down for a 10,
20, 30 minutes sit.

00:38:06.230 --> 00:38:08.209
And then when you
come out of it say,

00:38:08.209 --> 00:38:09.500
I now want to think about this.

00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.660
Go for a walk, because
you've just sort of

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.120
done an awesome workout
for your default network.

00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.680
And it's sort of
primed and ready to go.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.900
And then you have to let go and
let it sort of do its thing.

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:23.780
One of the issues with accessing
it is because of the world

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.140
we live in.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.706
We live in a world where we
are on task all the time.

00:38:28.706 --> 00:38:30.080
And one of the
interesting things

00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.010
is Douglas Rushkoff, an author,
has this fascinating concept

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.990
where he said we have all this
technology, all these machines,

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:37.520
and yet we're busier than ever.

00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.130
Weren't they supposed to
make our lives easier?

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.300
Why is this?

00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:45.800
And his theory is that we have
internalized machine time.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.370
We actually operate at the pace
and rate of the machines that

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:51.110
are supposed to be helping us.

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.450
And so we answer emails
at all times of the night.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.980
We answer phone calls whenever.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.020
We're on constantly.

00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.970
And the problem with
being on constantly

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:01.400
is you never access
your default mode.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.410
You never access
the genius lounge,

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:05.060
and therefore you
never give yourself

00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:07.610
the chance to have
the brilliant ideas,

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:09.590
to have the great breakthrough.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.470
The interesting thing is that
to have a true breakthrough,

00:39:12.470 --> 00:39:15.920
we need to pull back and
step into human time.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.940
We need to slow down, we need
to allow that pace to happen.

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.800
We operate better when
we do that, we just

00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:26.810
forget, get overwhelmed,
and then go, go, go, go, go.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:28.970
And it's not helpful.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:31.060
So part of the
challenge with accessing

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:34.710
this is allowing
yourself to slow down,

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:39.340
is allowing yourself to
re-enter human time to do things

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.140
like walk and nap and rest.

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.010
Awe.

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:46.170
The experience of awe
is a wonderful way

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.480
to access your network.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.580
You just look up at
a picture like this,

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.910
and the sheer immensity of
it all, and how small we are,

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.460
and we're aware of something
larger than ourselves.

00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:58.440
And the research shows we just--

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.690
we open up into a
whole different space.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:03.030
And we open up our brains
into a whole different space.

00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:05.040
And different connections occur.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.160
Different parts of our brain
start talking, and we just--

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:08.970
we're open to this.

00:40:08.970 --> 00:40:11.530
And this also
makes us slow down.

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:13.260
You ever see anybody
just running along

00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:15.240
the rim of the Grand Canyon?

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.250
When you come upon
something that produces awe,

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:17.850
you slow down.

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:21.840
When you walk up to a
Redwood, you slow down,

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:25.537
and you just kind of sit
there and say, my god.

00:40:25.537 --> 00:40:27.120
You don't even have
to believe in God,

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:29.130
and that kind of comes
out of your mouth

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:33.600
because we're just aware of this
larger entity in the universe.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:37.860
And so go and look out, even
just looking out across the bay

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:38.460
will do this.

00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.180
So look out at the ocean, or
go up to the top of Mount Tam,

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:44.400
and just look.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:47.100
The grand vistas will
ignite this in us,

00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.270
will bring it out of us.

00:40:51.986 --> 00:40:53.860
I want to talk a little
bit about constraints

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.086
and the concept of wabi
sabi because constraints

00:40:56.086 --> 00:40:57.460
can be incredibly
helpful when it

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:00.550
comes to accessing this sort
of breakthrough ability.

00:41:00.550 --> 00:41:02.770
Wabi sabi is this
Japanese design concept

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:04.490
where you start with the flaw.

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.180
The flaw is your zero
point, and you integrate it.

00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.680
The flaw is not to
be gotten rid of.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.570
The flaw's not a
problem, the flaw

00:41:10.570 --> 00:41:14.020
actually directs the way in
which you're going to design.

00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.590
And I love what street
artists do with this stuff.

00:41:16.590 --> 00:41:20.950
So a crack in the wall
becomes Spiderman's web,

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.820
and a railing becomes fun
for Calvin and Hobbes.

00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:28.050
And this guy is
breaking out of jail.

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.990
In this one they've turned the
breaking down of the plaster

00:41:30.990 --> 00:41:32.531
on the outside wall
into a factory,

00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:34.530
and it's the smoke coming
out of the smokestack.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:37.650
This kid's having a good time.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:41.400
And here we've got camels
making their way in a caravan.

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.704
And all of this is
from they saw a flaw.

00:41:43.704 --> 00:41:45.120
Something was
wrong, and then they

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.960
used that to define how they
were going to create the art.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.472
And so the question becomes
what's the flaw in your system?

00:41:51.472 --> 00:41:52.680
What's your biggest obstacle?

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.940
If you start from that
point, and not say,

00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:58.500
how do I get rid of it, but
say how is this my start point,

00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:02.910
it creates all kinds of creative
abilities, creative capacities.

00:42:02.910 --> 00:42:05.190
The flaw acts as sort
of the access point

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.287
into your default network.

00:42:07.287 --> 00:42:09.870
And so one way you can do this,
and you can do this with teams

00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:11.612
as well, is you build
a constraint box.

00:42:11.612 --> 00:42:13.320
And we've found that
to be really useful.

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.030
We did this with Genentech
a little bit ago,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:16.140
and it was very helpful.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.973
Because they were talking
about how annoying

00:42:17.973 --> 00:42:19.625
the federal regulations were.

00:42:19.625 --> 00:42:21.250
So we spun it around,
and we were like,

00:42:21.250 --> 00:42:22.590
we'll let's talk about
what are the constraints.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.798
And what you do you start
to lay out the constraints.

00:42:24.798 --> 00:42:27.480
Right, Dave is a
serious problem for me.

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:28.930
So is the FDA.

00:42:28.930 --> 00:42:31.759
So is the cash flow, and
it's really not sexy,

00:42:31.759 --> 00:42:32.800
what we're talking about.

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.870
It's going to be hard to get
anybody interested in it.

00:42:34.870 --> 00:42:36.090
So these are some
of your constraints.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:37.200
And you just get
a sense of them.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.270
You lay them out so they
don't get overwhelming.

00:42:39.270 --> 00:42:40.200
The next thing you
do is you start

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.790
talking about your assumptions.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:43.890
Because very often you're
assuming things that

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.227
aren't right, that aren't true.

00:42:45.227 --> 00:42:47.310
And if you don't write
them down and look at them,

00:42:47.310 --> 00:42:49.740
they're just going to
stymie you the whole way.

00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:52.380
So, no one's going
to listen, Angela

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:55.360
hates this idea, 18
months to see results.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.840
It's cost prohibitive, you
just lay it all out there.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.210
You look at it, and you
question all these assumptions.

00:43:00.210 --> 00:43:03.157
Are they really constraints
or are they just things

00:43:03.157 --> 00:43:03.990
that you've assumed?

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.820
They're conversations
you haven't had.

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:07.500
And the reason you
do it in this form

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:08.916
is because what
happens in the end

00:43:08.916 --> 00:43:12.480
is this becomes
your solution space.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.920
You've now defined
where you can be free.

00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:17.430
You've defined the space where
your default network can now

00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:19.390
try any number of things.

00:43:19.390 --> 00:43:22.200
So as opposed to these things
hemming you in and locking you

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.420
in, they turn
around and free you.

00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.920
Because now you
know that you don't

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.270
have to bother looking
at those things,

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:30.353
you have to bother beating
your head against them,

00:43:30.353 --> 00:43:34.796
and now you've got this
space that's opened up.

00:43:34.796 --> 00:43:36.920
And that freedom is what
allows the default network

00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:39.002
to start to truly function.

00:43:39.002 --> 00:43:40.960
And so especially when
you do this with a team,

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.504
it's amazing what
comes out and why.

00:43:42.504 --> 00:43:44.920
You start finding out that
there are all these assumptions

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:46.300
on the table that
have stopped people

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:48.580
from getting interested in
things that weren't even

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.770
correct in the first place.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:53.030
And little by little,
people start to realize,

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:55.090
oh, but you know what we can
do, oh you know what we can do,

00:43:55.090 --> 00:43:57.460
and once you're in that space,
now your default network

00:43:57.460 --> 00:43:59.684
is live and functioning.

00:43:59.684 --> 00:44:01.600
And so this is one of
the ways the constraints

00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:04.690
can act as a really powerful
tool to get you into this.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.380
Roman Mars of 99% Visible,
a really fun podcast,

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.570
he has a great TED talk
talking about flags.

00:44:10.570 --> 00:44:12.970
And he's like, you should
be able to draw your flag

00:44:12.970 --> 00:44:15.532
on a three by five note card.

00:44:15.532 --> 00:44:17.490
And everybody thinks it's
ridiculous and crazy,

00:44:17.490 --> 00:44:20.170
but he's like that's one of the
best constraints you can have,

00:44:20.170 --> 00:44:21.878
because it's going to
drive you to making

00:44:21.878 --> 00:44:22.930
a really excellent flag.

00:44:22.930 --> 00:44:25.138
And you can use that kind
of constraint and anything.

00:44:25.138 --> 00:44:27.330
Can you express it in a
three by five note card?

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:30.310
Well then you probably don't
understand it well enough.

00:44:30.310 --> 00:44:31.077
Yes?

00:44:31.077 --> 00:44:33.304
AUDIENCE: Why do you call
it the default network?

00:44:33.304 --> 00:44:35.470
JUDAH POLLACK: Why do I
call it the default network?

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.750
I don't, I'm quoting.

00:44:37.750 --> 00:44:41.860
When you're on task and doing
something, it goes more quiet.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:46.710
When you're off task, your
brain defaults to this network.

00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:48.770
It just-- this is where
it goes every time.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.040
So that's why it's called
the default mode network.

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.990
And one of the funny
pieces is that the person

00:44:52.990 --> 00:44:57.985
who discovered it,
Dr. Marcus Raichle--

00:44:57.985 --> 00:44:58.485
how'd I do?

00:44:58.485 --> 00:45:00.450
OK, we'll leave it alone.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:01.950
The way he figured
it out was he was

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.317
noticing that when he
had people in fMRIs,

00:45:04.317 --> 00:45:06.900
and told them to just hang on a
second, just wait, don't think

00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:08.830
about anything, we have
to do something over here,

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:10.110
all of a sudden all
this activity showed up

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:10.800
in their brains.

00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.210
And everyone was like,
oh it's just static,

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:13.380
it's just noise, whatever.

00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:15.540
And then one day, he
walks out of a meeting,

00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:20.127
he's wandering down a hall,
and it just showed up.

00:45:20.127 --> 00:45:21.960
The idea showed up, and
so what happened was

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:24.251
he was thinking about this,
he was thinking about this,

00:45:24.251 --> 00:45:26.180
and then when he was
off task, wandering down

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.250
a hall, his default network,
the brain defaulted to it,

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.190
and then it gave him an answer
to a question he'd been asking.

00:45:32.190 --> 00:45:34.904
Which is what's up with
all this noise in the fMRI.

00:45:34.904 --> 00:45:35.820
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.310
JUDAH POLLACK: Yes.

00:45:37.310 --> 00:45:39.680
It's-- it's because it's this--

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:42.474
it's this place where all
these different pieces

00:45:42.474 --> 00:45:44.390
are coming together and
talking to each other.

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:44.960
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.070
JUDAH POLLACK: And--
right, and they're

00:45:46.070 --> 00:45:47.210
just sort of putting
things together.

00:45:47.210 --> 00:45:48.350
So we've discovered it.

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:51.080
It truly is the engine
of our creativity.

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:53.122
That's what we've been
starting to find out.

00:45:53.122 --> 00:45:55.580
And so these are all just ways
you can actually get into it

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.025
and use it, focus
yourself on it.

00:45:57.025 --> 00:45:59.150
One of the things that--
we talked about this a lot

00:45:59.150 --> 00:46:00.649
in the beginning
of the book, can we

00:46:00.649 --> 00:46:01.970
give a kitchen recipe for this?

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:07.220
Can we say one cup of
butter, two eggs, some sugar,

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:10.160
some chocolate chips, voila,
you'll have a breakthrough.

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.650
And the answer is no.

00:46:11.650 --> 00:46:15.920
It's a non-linear process;
it's an emergent process.

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.704
And so you have to give
yourself time with it.

00:46:18.704 --> 00:46:20.870
But what we're teaching you
is that you can actually

00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:23.420
set conditions to make
it far more likely

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:25.110
that it will happen.

00:46:25.110 --> 00:46:28.010
Switching, I want to
make a slight switch now

00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:29.930
to associative thinking,
which in the end

00:46:29.930 --> 00:46:31.992
is truly what your
default network is doing.

00:46:31.992 --> 00:46:34.450
And so I'm going to show you
something that will both raise

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:38.540
your plasticity but also kind of
get into associative thinking.

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:40.284
Somebody left their
Go Pro on the ground

00:46:40.284 --> 00:46:41.450
and a squirrel picked it up.

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:21.730
So, I don't know about
you, but I'd never

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:22.870
seen anything like that.

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:26.530
That is literally a squirrel's
eye view of the world.

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.040
And so it does a
couple of things.

00:47:28.040 --> 00:47:29.747
One, it forces this
growth of plasticity

00:47:29.747 --> 00:47:32.080
because you're like oh, my
god, it's like it's this big,

00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.820
and it's moving on branches
you could never move on,

00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:35.680
and it's moving so
quickly through the tree.

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:37.388
I used to move through
trees very slowly.

00:47:37.388 --> 00:47:39.130
And all of this is
new and new and new.

00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:41.980
And then at the same time,
it adds to this piece

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:43.990
that we call
associative thinking.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.864
So all the media about
artificial intelligence

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:49.280
and how it's going to replace
human beings and yadda yadda

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.620
yadda.

00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:52.900
Most people who are
aware know that there's

00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:55.630
this big leap between where
AI is at the moment, which

00:47:55.630 --> 00:47:58.720
is amazingly good at the
pattern recognition and the data

00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.740
crunching, and the
intuitive, inferential leaps

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.040
between ideas.

00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:06.040
And that's something that
human beings are still

00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.290
particularly good at.

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:11.000
And it's the association
of the different ideas,

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.120
what's sometimes known
as abductive reasoning.

00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.530
To have a little
bit of data here

00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:17.170
and then to get a whole
theory out of it here.

00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:19.720
And this is what the default
mode network gives us.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:22.060
It is what takes
different pieces of data

00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.520
and puts them together into
a whole new conceptions,

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:25.990
whole new theories.

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:29.290
And so having experiences that
are completely different--

00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:31.240
this gets at the hobby idea--

00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.000
brings in the ability to
create these associations

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.160
you might not ordinarily see.

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:39.440
So in the same way in
the 1970s San Francis--

00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:41.320
California, there was
a huge drought, people

00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:42.945
drained their swimming
pools, they just

00:48:42.945 --> 00:48:44.230
looked like empty holes.

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:47.389
But a bunch of kids were
like, these are skateparks.

00:48:47.389 --> 00:48:49.930
That's something that comes up
from the default mode network.

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.640
Or the skateboarding
kid who wants

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.500
to be able to keep
practicing in winter,

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.910
so he creates a snowboard,
and invents snowboarding.

00:48:57.910 --> 00:49:01.270
Or the Army has got
Lexan, a hard plastic,

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:03.430
that is used in
their windshields

00:49:03.430 --> 00:49:04.870
of their helicopters.

00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.660
And these windshields
are getting scratched up

00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:09.700
like nobody's business
in the deserts of Iraq

00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:11.440
and Afghanistan,
and in the training

00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.319
at Fort Irwin in California.

00:49:13.319 --> 00:49:14.860
And they're spending
tens of millions

00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.340
of dollars replacing
these Lexan, very

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.900
scratchable windshields.

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.480
And lo and behold, there are
these two Army Reserve National

00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:26.770
Reserve guardmen who are
helicopter mechanics and NASCAR

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:27.790
fans.

00:49:27.790 --> 00:49:29.165
And they're like,
well, you know,

00:49:29.165 --> 00:49:31.330
NASCAR uses the same Lexan
on their windshields,

00:49:31.330 --> 00:49:34.420
but they put these thin
mylar sheets on top of them

00:49:34.420 --> 00:49:35.362
before every race.

00:49:35.362 --> 00:49:37.570
They're called tearaways,
and at the end of the race,

00:49:37.570 --> 00:49:38.590
they pull them off.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.450
The mylar took all the
hits and scratches,

00:49:40.450 --> 00:49:41.710
and the windshield's fine.

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.110
But why don't we just put
them on the army helicopters?

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:46.151
They took it from one
place, moved it to another,

00:49:46.151 --> 00:49:48.400
they associated it, saved
the Army tens of millions

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.860
of dollars because the
windshield's lifespan doubled

00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:51.880
and tripled.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.020
But it was already there.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:55.780
They associated it; they
moved it to another realm.

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.150
And very often this
is how we end up

00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:59.500
seeing innovation happen.

00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:03.660
How many of you know of
Thomas Edison's electric pen?

00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.900
Exactly.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:08.070
He's not very proud of it
either, wasn't very successful.

00:50:08.070 --> 00:50:11.250
Ended up in the window of a
pawn shop, downtown New York.

00:50:11.250 --> 00:50:14.010
Who should be walking by but
this guy, Samuel O'Reilly.

00:50:14.010 --> 00:50:15.610
Samuel O'Reilly
takes a look at it,

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:17.030
and he's a pretty clever guy.

00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:19.740
And he's like, I think I
could change this around.

00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:23.380
Samuel O'Reilly invents
modern tattooing

00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:27.070
by changing the electric pen.

00:50:27.070 --> 00:50:30.200
Moving things in their context,
from one context to another,

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.560
is very often where these
innovative ideas come from.

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.790
It's the association.

00:50:33.790 --> 00:50:35.290
And it's your default
network that's

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:37.750
making those associations,
that's connecting,

00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:40.660
that's inferring, that's
intuiting between vastly

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.390
different things.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.350
So there is a young
meteorologist--

00:50:49.350 --> 00:50:52.599
whose name I wrote
down, I can't remember.

00:50:52.599 --> 00:50:53.640
It's over here somewhere.

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:54.750
I'll get it at the end.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.810
But he's up in the Arctic
in the early 1900s.

00:50:57.810 --> 00:51:00.930
And something just strikes
him, that the ice kind of looks

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:02.670
like jigsaw puzzle pieces.

00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:03.310
And that's it.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:04.570
He just notices that.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:06.710
It's interesting to him.

00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:08.390
A year later, he's
looking at a globe.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:11.100
He's like, huh, you
know, the continents kind

00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:13.230
of look like jigsaw pieces.

00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:15.450
I wonder if they
were ever together.

00:51:15.450 --> 00:51:18.060
And he goes, and he checks out
the rocks along South America

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:19.260
and along Africa,
and he checks out

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:20.801
some of the floor
and fauna, and he's

00:51:20.801 --> 00:51:22.890
like I think these
things drifted.

00:51:22.890 --> 00:51:24.900
He invented the concept
of continental drift,

00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.840
which eventually took
us to plate tectonics.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.250
A meteorologist
making a breakthrough

00:51:29.250 --> 00:51:31.260
in geology because
of an association

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.500
he made by looking at
the ice in the Arctic.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.740
This is very often how it
works, this idea of curiosity,

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.180
of noticing the way different
things come together.

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:42.217
And it's the default
network, it's mindlessly

00:51:42.217 --> 00:51:43.800
staring out at the
ice and being like,

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.420
huh, they look like
jigsaw puzzles.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:48.400
And then mindlessly staring
at a globe and being like,

00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.810
oh, the jigsaw puzzles kind of
remind me of the continents.

00:51:51.810 --> 00:51:53.536
This is where these
things come together,

00:51:53.536 --> 00:51:54.660
and that's what I'm saying.

00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.310
It's important to
allow ourselves

00:51:56.310 --> 00:51:59.400
to be off task, because we
don't allow ourselves to access

00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.099
that network otherwise.

00:52:01.099 --> 00:52:02.640
So I want you to
imagine that gravity

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.340
stops working at 10 PM and
then starts working again

00:52:05.340 --> 00:52:07.400
at 7:00 AM.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.600
How is our entire
culture different?

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.460
Start throwing things out,
whatever you can come up with.

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.651
Are there nets over every house?

00:52:16.651 --> 00:52:18.400
Are houses designed
more like boats, where

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:21.240
everything is locked down?

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.209
Are children sort of tied to
their beds before 7:00 PM?

00:52:25.209 --> 00:52:27.000
How do teenagers play
around with this, how

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.374
do they rebel,
given this, how do

00:52:28.374 --> 00:52:30.240
they get in trouble given this?

00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.657
How do people throw
nighttime parties?

00:52:32.657 --> 00:52:33.990
What does Burning Man look like?

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.260
You could just keep asking
yourself this, over and over

00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:42.180
again, and it seems
silly, but really it's

00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:45.210
coming out of the tradition
of thought experiments,

00:52:45.210 --> 00:52:47.430
which Einstein uses.

00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:49.900
Just playing out what is
possible in the universe,

00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:50.955
what might occur.

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:58.550
And one last one I'll show
you, the very end is, so this--

00:52:58.550 --> 00:53:00.780
whoops.

00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:02.580
Yeah, this is the
world's most boring video

00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.310
unless you put
this music over it.

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:08.880
Now all of a sudden
there's tension.

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:12.030
And you're probably wondering,
did I put a shark in it?

00:53:12.030 --> 00:53:13.530
Is there-- is it
going to pop up?

00:53:13.530 --> 00:53:15.680
Are you going to see
that fin come up?

00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:17.820
Or is it just the
mouth going to pop up?

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:19.740
I don't have those
skills, this is just

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:21.480
like the world's
most boring clouds

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.760
out the window of an airplane.

00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.070
But we put the music on,
and suddenly your brain's

00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:27.670
creating a whole universe.

00:53:27.670 --> 00:53:31.006
You can do this with any
movie scene in the universe.

00:53:31.006 --> 00:53:34.380
All right, I'll end the tension.

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:36.810
You can literally take
any movie scene you want,

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:38.580
add music to it, and
watch how it changes.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.371
Watch what happens.

00:53:39.371 --> 00:53:41.400
I had one group where
somebody shouted out

00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:43.740
last scene of "Casablanca,"
and somebody shouted out

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.822
"We Are The Champions" by Queen.

00:53:45.822 --> 00:53:47.030
And they thought they had me.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:48.180
They thought they'd nailed me.

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.230
And I was a little
nervous, I was

00:53:49.230 --> 00:53:50.550
like, I don't know how
this is going to go.

00:53:50.550 --> 00:53:53.100
So we go to YouTube, we
bring up the "Casablanca,"

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:53.862
put it on mute.

00:53:53.862 --> 00:53:55.320
We bring up "We
Are The Champions,"

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.230
turn it on, start the two
of them, we start watching.

00:53:58.230 --> 00:54:00.850
And it's shocking how
it starts to line up.

00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:02.340
And as the plane
starts to take off

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:05.370
and Elsa's is being taken away,
the music is crescendoing,

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:08.980
and Freddie Mercury is
going, "We are the champ--"

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:10.970
and you like, oh my
god, it's so moving.

00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:13.410
And it's totally random, and--

00:54:13.410 --> 00:54:14.787
play this game.

00:54:14.787 --> 00:54:15.870
Literally, play this game.

00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:18.780
And it sounds silly,
but it's amazing

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.594
how it sets you
up for then being

00:54:21.594 --> 00:54:23.760
able to connect to things
you ordinarily would never

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.380
think would work.

00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:28.200
And that's where those
breakthroughs come from.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.930
So there's play involved,
there's a craft involved,

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:32.400
there's practice involved.

00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.750
There are these tools, it's--

00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.900
but it's not something in
theory, it's something you do.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:39.270
It's a way you are in the world.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.480
And so you have the ability.

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:43.830
You have the brain for this.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:47.250
You have all the parts
for it, everybody does.

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.610
We just have to use
them, practice with them,

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:51.360
and get comfortable with them.

00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.880
And that's why we
wrote the book.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.870
See, that's nicer.

00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:57.080
Thank you, everybody.

00:54:57.080 --> 00:54:59.830
[APPLAUSE]
