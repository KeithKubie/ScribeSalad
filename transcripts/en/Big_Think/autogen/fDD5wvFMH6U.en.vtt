well the amygdala is a small region of

00:00:05.929 --> 00:00:05.939
well the amygdala is a small region of
 

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.490
well the amygdala is a small region of
the brain it's in what's called the

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500
the brain it's in what's called the
 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.200
the brain it's in what's called the
temporal lobe of the brain if we divide

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210
temporal lobe of the brain if we divide
 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.780
temporal lobe of the brain if we divide
the cerebral hemispheres into the four

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
the cerebral hemispheres into the four
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.390
the cerebral hemispheres into the four
major lobes occipital temporal parietal

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
major lobes occipital temporal parietal
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.580
major lobes occipital temporal parietal
and frontal it's in the temporal lobe

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
and frontal it's in the temporal lobe
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.040
and frontal it's in the temporal lobe
which is under the temporal bone which

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050
which is under the temporal bone which
 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.560
which is under the temporal bone which
is behind your ear and the amygdala

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570
is behind your ear and the amygdala
 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.859
is behind your ear and the amygdala
would be located in a point at a point

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
would be located in a point at a point
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.960
would be located in a point at a point
where a line that goes through your eye

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970
where a line that goes through your eye
 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.720
where a line that goes through your eye
and through your ear in a set intersect

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730
and through your ear in a set intersect
 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.089
and through your ear in a set intersect
in your brain so imagine like someone

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099
in your brain so imagine like someone
 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.650
in your brain so imagine like someone
has shot an arrow through your eye and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660
has shot an arrow through your eye and
 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.750
has shot an arrow through your eye and
want another one into your ear where

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
want another one into your ear where
 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.850
want another one into your ear where
those two come together would be roughly

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
those two come together would be roughly
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.799
those two come together would be roughly
where it is and on both sides of the

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809
where it is and on both sides of the
 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.959
where it is and on both sides of the
brain of course because most structure

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
brain of course because most structure
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.030
brain of course because most structure
in fact all structures are bilateral in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040
in fact all structures are bilateral in
 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.240
in fact all structures are bilateral in
that sense so it's a you know it's

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250
that sense so it's a you know it's
 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.380
that sense so it's a you know it's
sometimes referred to as an almond or an

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
sometimes referred to as an almond or an
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479
sometimes referred to as an almond or an
almond shaped structure which is a bit

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
almond shaped structure which is a bit
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299
almond shaped structure which is a bit
of a misnomer because there's one part

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
of a misnomer because there's one part
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.799
of a misnomer because there's one part
of it that's almond shaped and that

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809
of it that's almond shaped and that
 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.959
of it that's almond shaped and that
caught the attention of early anatomist

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969
caught the attention of early anatomist
 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.150
caught the attention of early anatomist
and so they named this almond shaped

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
and so they named this almond shaped
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.820
and so they named this almond shaped
structure or the amygdala but as the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
structure or the amygdala but as the
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.580
structure or the amygdala but as the
amygdala began to be defined more

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
amygdala began to be defined more
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.560
amygdala began to be defined more
broadly it includes a lot of structures

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570
broadly it includes a lot of structures
 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.210
broadly it includes a lot of structures
other than that little almond shaped

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220
other than that little almond shaped
 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.590
other than that little almond shaped
piece it's most commonly associated with

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600
piece it's most commonly associated with
 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.000
piece it's most commonly associated with
fear although that's not it's only

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010
fear although that's not it's only
 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.700
fear although that's not it's only
function it's it's most heavily studied

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710
function it's it's most heavily studied
 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.969
function it's it's most heavily studied
function and the reason for that is that

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979
function and the reason for that is that
 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.890
function and the reason for that is that
it's much easier to study fear than

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
it's much easier to study fear than
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.770
it's much easier to study fear than
other emotions of things that are or bad

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
other emotions of things that are or bad
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.899
other emotions of things that are or bad
have more weight than things that are

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
have more weight than things that are
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.399
have more weight than things that are
good in a sense and you can put off

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
good in a sense and you can put off
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.460
good in a sense and you can put off
eating drinking sex whatever for an

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
eating drinking sex whatever for an
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.080
eating drinking sex whatever for an
indefinite amount of time but you have

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
indefinite amount of time but you have
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.380
indefinite amount of time but you have
to respond to danger immediately you

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
to respond to danger immediately you
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.179
to respond to danger immediately you
know you don't find great novels about

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
know you don't find great novels about
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.310
know you don't find great novels about
happy subject it's always about you know

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320
happy subject it's always about you know
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.399
happy subject it's always about you know
the bad stuff and it's sometimes said

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409
the bad stuff and it's sometimes said
 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.080
the bad stuff and it's sometimes said
that there's this negative bias and

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090
that there's this negative bias and
 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.770
that there's this negative bias and
emotion which is that most research on

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780
emotion which is that most research on
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.690
emotion which is that most research on
emotion is about the negative stuff but

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700
emotion is about the negative stuff but
 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.719
emotion is about the negative stuff but
the fact is that negative stuff turns

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729
the fact is that negative stuff turns
 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.999
the fact is that negative stuff turns
out to be the most important for

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009
out to be the most important for
 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.740
out to be the most important for
survival in a sense in terms of

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
survival in a sense in terms of
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.820
survival in a sense in terms of
immediacy and having to respond to

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830
 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.969
so some of the key interconnections of

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979
so some of the key interconnections of
 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.190
so some of the key interconnections of
the amygdala and these connections

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200
the amygdala and these connections
 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.810
the amygdala and these connections
actually define what it does in the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820
actually define what it does in the
 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.510
actually define what it does in the
sense at least with respect to fear the

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520
sense at least with respect to fear the
 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.030
sense at least with respect to fear the
amygdala gets sensory information

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
amygdala gets sensory information
 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.620
amygdala gets sensory information
directly from the various sensory

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
directly from the various sensory
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.450
directly from the various sensory
systems that process the external world

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460
systems that process the external world
 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.760
systems that process the external world
so be the visual system the auditory

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770
so be the visual system the auditory
 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.900
so be the visual system the auditory
system a factory touch pain and so forth

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910
system a factory touch pain and so forth
 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.300
system a factory touch pain and so forth
all of these kind of come together or

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310
all of these kind of come together or
 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.450
all of these kind of come together or
converge in the amygdala and then the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460
converge in the amygdala and then the
 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.280
converge in the amygdala and then the
amygdala connects on the output side

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290
amygdala connects on the output side
 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.410
amygdala connects on the output side
with all the systems involved in

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420
with all the systems involved in
 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.040
with all the systems involved in
emotional reactivity so when you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050
emotional reactivity so when you
 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.100
emotional reactivity so when you
encounter sudden danger you might freeze

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110
encounter sudden danger you might freeze
 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.510
encounter sudden danger you might freeze
your blood pressure and heart rate began

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520
your blood pressure and heart rate began
 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.880
your blood pressure and heart rate began
to rise stress hormones are released all

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890
to rise stress hormones are released all
 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.010
to rise stress hormones are released all
these things happen as a result of

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020
these things happen as a result of
 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.530
these things happen as a result of
outputs of the amygdala so the amygdala

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540
outputs of the amygdala so the amygdala
 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.750
outputs of the amygdala so the amygdala
you can think of as kind of this this

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760
you can think of as kind of this this
 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.110
you can think of as kind of this this
circle with one input coming in being

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120
circle with one input coming in being
 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.850
circle with one input coming in being
the or the input coming in being a

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860
the or the input coming in being a
 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.760
the or the input coming in being a
sensory flow of sensory information from

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770
sensory flow of sensory information from
 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.320
sensory flow of sensory information from
the external world then outputs being

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330
the external world then outputs being
 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.790
the external world then outputs being
connections to systems involved in

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800
connections to systems involved in
 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.760
connections to systems involved in
controlling the responses so but we have

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770
controlling the responses so but we have
 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.500
controlling the responses so but we have
to expand those inputs so it's getting

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510
to expand those inputs so it's getting
 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.330
to expand those inputs so it's getting
not just one sensory input but all

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340
not just one sensory input but all
 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.550
not just one sensory input but all
sensory inputs so each sensory system is

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560
sensory inputs so each sensory system is
 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.440
sensory inputs so each sensory system is
coming in and it doesn't stop there

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450
coming in and it doesn't stop there
 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.820
coming in and it doesn't stop there
because in addition to getting

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830
because in addition to getting
 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.070
because in addition to getting
information from sensory systems it also

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.080
information from sensory systems it also
 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.990
information from sensory systems it also
gets information from higher order

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000
gets information from higher order
 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.150
gets information from higher order
systems like the prefrontal cortex and

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160
systems like the prefrontal cortex and
 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.190
systems like the prefrontal cortex and
higher order Association areas involved

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200
higher order Association areas involved
 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.380
higher order Association areas involved
in various kinds of integrative

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390
in various kinds of integrative
 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.619
in various kinds of integrative
activities in the cortex

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629
 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.679
what it does is a function of what

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:41.689
what it does is a function of what
 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.140
what it does is a function of what
connections it has so because it has

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150
connections it has so because it has
 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970
connections it has so because it has
connections with all these sensory

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980
connections with all these sensory
 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.399
connections with all these sensory
systems it can take in information from

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:48.409
systems it can take in information from
 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.559
systems it can take in information from
the environment of a variety of types

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569
the environment of a variety of types
 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:56.559
the environment of a variety of types
and use that information and so if you

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569
and use that information and so if you
 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.660
and use that information and so if you
know if a sound and the in the external

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670
know if a sound and the in the external
 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.860
know if a sound and the in the external
world occurs right before something

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870
world occurs right before something
 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.229
world occurs right before something
painful happens you associate that sound

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239
painful happens you associate that sound
 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.410
painful happens you associate that sound
with the painful event and that sound

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420
with the painful event and that sound
 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.300
with the painful event and that sound
will then later trigger a protective

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310
will then later trigger a protective
 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.179
will then later trigger a protective
defense response but if the sound occurs

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189
defense response but if the sound occurs
 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:17.800
defense response but if the sound occurs
just before food when you're hungry then

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810
just before food when you're hungry then
 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.659
just before food when you're hungry then
the sound will be associated with with

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669
the sound will be associated with with
 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.060
the sound will be associated with with
that kind of a positive or repetitive

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070
that kind of a positive or repetitive
 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.540
that kind of a positive or repetitive
event and so what the amygdala is doing

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550
event and so what the amygdala is doing
 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.110
event and so what the amygdala is doing
is forming associations between random

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120
is forming associations between random
 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.870
is forming associations between random
or neutral external stimuli and the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880
or neutral external stimuli and the
 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.080
or neutral external stimuli and the
kinds of reinforcing events that will

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090
kinds of reinforcing events that will
 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.650
kinds of reinforcing events that will
stamp in those experiences in a stronger

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660
stamp in those experiences in a stronger
 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.499
stamp in those experiences in a stronger
way so it's it's creating these what's

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:41.509
way so it's it's creating these what's
 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:43.659
way so it's it's creating these what's
called Pavlovian associations you know

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669
called Pavlovian associations you know
 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.020
called Pavlovian associations you know
stimulus 1 plus stimulus 2 if one of

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030
stimulus 1 plus stimulus 2 if one of
 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.089
stimulus 1 plus stimulus 2 if one of
those is in a biologically significant

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099
those is in a biologically significant
 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.710
those is in a biologically significant
stimulus then the other one will require

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720
stimulus then the other one will require
 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.060
stimulus then the other one will require
some kind of biological significance

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070
some kind of biological significance
 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:54.730
some kind of biological significance
itself whether it's positive or negative

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740
itself whether it's positive or negative
 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.189
itself whether it's positive or negative
and that information can then be used

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199
and that information can then be used
 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.080
and that information can then be used
and this is sort of what I think you're

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090
and this is sort of what I think you're
 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.850
and this is sort of what I think you're
referring to in terms of adaptive

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860
referring to in terms of adaptive
 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.570
referring to in terms of adaptive
behavior so that csus relationship or

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580
behavior so that csus relationship or
 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.260
behavior so that csus relationship or
say a sound food relationship can then

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270
say a sound food relationship can then
 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.200
say a sound food relationship can then
be used to guide instrumental behavior

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210
be used to guide instrumental behavior
 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.230
be used to guide instrumental behavior
which is goal-directed behavior so if in

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240
which is goal-directed behavior so if in
 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.800
which is goal-directed behavior so if in
the past you've obtained food at a

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810
the past you've obtained food at a
 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.290
the past you've obtained food at a
certain location the stimuli that are

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300
certain location the stimuli that are
 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.779
certain location the stimuli that are
proximal to that location service

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:22.789
proximal to that location service
 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:24.750
proximal to that location service
conditions stimuli and you know are

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760
conditions stimuli and you know are
 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.830
conditions stimuli and you know are
reinforcing to you because they're close

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840
reinforcing to you because they're close
 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.230
reinforcing to you because they're close
to the actual goal and they take you

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240
to the actual goal and they take you
 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.450
to the actual goal and they take you
towards the goal same thing happens with

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460
towards the goal same thing happens with
 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.490
towards the goal same thing happens with
the vs. stimulate the it's just that it

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500
the vs. stimulate the it's just that it
 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.340
the vs. stimulate the it's just that it
works in the opposite way
