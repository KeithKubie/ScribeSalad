00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.640
If we want to colonize space, we have to figure out how to generate

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.900
a large supply of life sustaining resources.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.849
The most important being water.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.719
The good news is, traces of water have been
detected throughout our solar system.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.480
And asteroids may hold the most accessible
abundance of water that we know of.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.520
There are likely millions of asteroids within
our solar system and over 18,000 are classified

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.320
as near-Earth objects - meaning they're located
relatively close to our planet.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.120
It's estimated that collectively these asteroids
could hold two trillion metric tons of water.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.519
While others are thought to hold rare Earth
minerals and metals worth trillions of dollars.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.660
So could we mine these space rocks?

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.820
There are a lot of different types of asteroids,
all of which orbit the Sun with most inhabiting

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.020
the region between Mars and Jupiter known
as the asteroid belt.

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.500
One way they're classified is by spectral
type, which is based

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.340
on their emission spectrum, color and albedo.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:15.360
Most asteroids fall into three classes: C-Type,
S-Type and M-type each of which could be extremely

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.580
valuable for their unique resources.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.240
C-type asteroids are thought to be the most common.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:28.000
C stands for carbon, which accounts for their
dark color and a large part of their composition

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.960
along with silicate rocks and clay.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.760
Meanwhile, less common, S-Type or silicaceous
asteroids are greenish to reddish and are

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.500
thought to be made of silicate materials and
nickel-iron.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.300
Similarly, M-Type asteroids also seem to be
made up of mostly nickel-iron, which is why

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.080
they're called metallic asteroids.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.140
S and M-Types are thought to be instant money
makers due to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.940
their abundance of precious metals.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.400
It's estimated a football field sized asteroid
could hold

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.000
$25 to $50 billion worth of platinum alone.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.980
But of all the asteroids, C-Types are referred
to as the best all-around for mining and that's

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:15.220
because they have high abundances of water
bound up as hydrated clay minerals.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.140
Water is not only critical for space colonization,
but it can also be broken down into its constituents

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.170
- hydrogen and oxygen - and used as rocket
fuel.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.790
It takes a lot of energy to leave Earth's
atmosphere, so mined asteroids could potentially

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.360
solve propulsion problems by providing space
sourced fuel.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.100
So are cosmic gas stations really possible?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.400
Well, the beginnings of the asteroid rush
are full speed ahead.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.060
First, we have to learn more about near-Earth
asteroids and their mining potential.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.540
NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is on a mission
to the potentially hazardous asteroid, Bennu.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.660
The spacecraft will attempt to collect samples
of dust from Bennu's surface

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.200
and bring them back to Earth.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.190
There are also private companies joining this
futuristic space race - all hoping to crack

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.400
this potentially trillion dollar industry.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.470
All they have to do is figure out a way to
mine massive rocks moving at over 20 kilometers

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.290
per second... in space.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.620
No big deal.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.940
