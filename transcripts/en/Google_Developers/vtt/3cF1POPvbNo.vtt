00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.930
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome to Google I/O 2017.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm Timothy Jordan, and I'll
be here between sessions

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.940
to guide you around the
in-person experiences

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.109
at the festival.

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.650
That's right.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.379
Even though you're
joining remotely,

00:00:27.379 --> 00:00:28.920
this year you'll
get an in-depth look

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.470
at everything happening
on the ground.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.360
Have a question about I/O '17?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.710
Tweet it our way today
through the 19th,

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.870
using hashtag #io17request,
and a team of Googlers will be

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.910
on site, tracking
down answers for you.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.430
You just saw our
developer keynote,

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.830
where Jason Titus led you
through our investments

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.320
in tools and services
for developers.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.710
That's you.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.220
It's our goal to simplify
repetitive tasks,

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.740
like dealing with
user login, analytics,

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:57.900
or synchronizing real-time data.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.670
We're providing tools
to make it easier

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.030
to solve these and
other everyday problems

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.140
in simple and
powerful ways, and we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.290
want to help you build
amazing new experiences

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
with machine learning, VR, and
voice-enabled interactions.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.590
Let's review a handful of
the announcements you just

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.990
heard along those lines.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.600
Android is officially supporting
the Kotlin programming

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.440
language, in addition to
the Java language and C++.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.320
Kotlin is a brilliantly
designed, mature,

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.150
production-ready
language that we

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.700
believe will make Android
development faster and more

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.560
fun.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.130
Android Studio 3.0
Canary is our new preview

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.380
that includes three major
features to accelerate

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.450
the development
flow, a new suite

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.280
of app performance
profiling tools

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.700
to quickly diagnose performance
issues, support for the Kotlin

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.370
programming language,
and increased gradle

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.480
build speeds for
large-sized app projects.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.610
With Firebase, we're
providing more insights

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.300
to understand app performance
through a new product, Firebase

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.950
Performance Monitoring.

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.860
We're also introducing
integration between hosting

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.680
and cloud functions, adding
support for phone number

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.620
authentication, and
improving analytics.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.550
Oh, and we've also started
open sourcing our SDKs.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.740
We've introduced new
innovations for you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.470
to make it easy for your
users to pay for services

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.550
with the Google Payment API,
to build profitable businesses

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.430
with a completely
redesigned AdMob,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.660
and to grow a user base with
Universal App Campaigns.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.460
There are several
powerful new features

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.730
and reports in the Play console
to help you improve your app's

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.400
performance, manage
releases with confidence,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
reach a global audience,
and grow your business.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.520
Android Instant
Apps is a new way

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.010
to run Android apps without
requiring installation.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.360
Now anyone can build and
publish an Instant App.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.660
There are also more
than 50 new experiences

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.870
available for users to try
out from a variety of brands,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.130
such as Jet, New York
Times, Vimeo, and Zillow.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.100
And finally, we're adding
two new certifications

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.220
for web developers-- the
mobile site certification

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.330
and the mobile web
specialist certification.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.040
Those are some of
the highlights.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.630
Check out our Google
Developers blog

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.350
for a more in-depth recap of
this afternoon's announcements.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.180
We have 14 content tracks with
over 140 breakout sessions,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.500
all live streamed.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.010
And in between them all,
I'll be your all-access pass,

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.040
with Sandbox tours,
interviews, and even a peek

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.960
or two at the parties.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.380
Tune into the live
stream on google.com/io.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.740

any of the Livestream channels,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.610
