00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's say we have some
ammonia gas.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.720
That's NH3 and it's a gas,
that's why the g is in

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.770
parentheses.

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:15.150
And we combine that with some
oxygen, molecular oxygen, it's

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.360
also a gas.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:24.380
And that reaction produces
some nitrogen monoxide.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.320
NO, monoxide, there's only
one oxygen there.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.950
That's also a gas, it's also
called nitric oxide, not to be

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.690
confused with nitrous oxide.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.230
I'll write nitrous oxide, it's
N2O, this is laughing gas.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.450
Anyway, I don't want to divert
you too much, we have to focus

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.640
on the problem.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.272
So this is nitric oxide
or nitrogen monoxide.

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:49.890
It's a pollutant, I think
it comes out of

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:50.930
some cigarette smokes.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.450
I think it's used in
the body, as well.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.670
You could we could look
it up on the internet.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.670
There's your oxide.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.860
Ammonia is an important
fertilizer.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.910
You know all about oxygen.

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.130
And this also yields
some water.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.390
So, plus some H2O.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:14.270
And we're told that we're given
34 grams of ammonia.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.585
And we're given 32
grams of oxygen.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.132
This is going to be the
oxygen molecule, O2.

00:01:26.132 --> 00:01:31.320
So the question is, how many
grams of nitrogen monoxide, or

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.930
the nitric oxide, are going
to be produced?

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.560
So how much of just the NO is
going to be produced in grams?

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.650
So this is a stoichiometry
problem.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.120
And so the important thing first
is to just make sure we

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.580
have a balanced equation before
we even start anything.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.200
And lo and behold, we don't
have a balanced equation.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.740
Let's confirm that it's
not balanced.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.530
Let's see, we have one nitrogen
here, we have one

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.320
nitrogen there.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.710
That looks balanced so far.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.610
And remember, the pattern is
start with the complicated

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.810
stuff, leave the single atom
molecules for last. Because

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.889
those you can fix at the
end without missing

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.060
anything else up.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.570
Hydrogen, we have three
hydrogens on

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.190
the left-hand side.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.120
On the right-hand side we
have two hydrogens.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.030
So let's see, how can we have
three hydrogens on the

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.610
right-hand side?

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.360
If we multiply this times one
and a half, 1.5, now we have

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.250
three hydrogens on this side.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.750
1.5 times 2, we have
three hydrogens on

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.030
the right-hand side.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.280
Things are looking good.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.760
We have two oxygen on
the left-hand side.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.300
How many oxygens do we have
on the right-hand side?

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.900
We have one oxygen here, and
we have one oxygen in this

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.540
molecule, but we have one and a
half of the whole molecule.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.330
So we have one and a half
oxygens and then we have one

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:53.040
more oxygen.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.800
So we have two and a half
oxygens on the right-hand

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.740
side, we only have two
in this molecule.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.190
So what do we have to do?

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.810
How can we get two and
a half oxygens here?

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.810
Well if we multiply it
by 5/4, or 1.25.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.400
5/4 times 2 is 5/2,
which is 2.5.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.050
So now we have 2.5 oxygens.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.070
5/4 times 2 is 2.5.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.810
1 plus 1.5 is also 2.5.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.270
Well, we're not balanced yet.

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.850
We can't leave this equation
with just these weird decimal

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.980
numbers over there.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.230
So let's rewrite it.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.440
If we wanted to get rid of all
of these, we can multiply the

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.970
entire equation by 2.

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.010
No, not 2.

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.640
We have to multiply the entire
equation by 4 to get rid of

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.670
this 4 in the denominator.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:55.170
So we multiply the entire
equation by 4, we have 4

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.170
molecules of ammonia.

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.270
We can even think of it
in terms of moles.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.120
Right now I'm thinking of
individual molecules.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.200
But we could say we have
4 moles of ammonia.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.620
4 times 6 times 10 to the
23 molecules of ammonia.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.640
Either way it all works out.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.940
Hopefully, you're starting to
see the value of moles.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.010
Plus 5 molecules, I'll just
think of it in terms of

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.780
individual molecules for
now, plus 5 molecules

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.316
of molecular oxygen.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.260
We're just multiplying
everything by 4, that's what

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.990
we're doing.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:45.550
Yields 4 moles of nitrogen
monoxide.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:50.690
So 4NO plus, we multiplied
both sides by

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.630
4, so plus 6 waters.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.940
6 H2O.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.500
So there you go, we
got some good

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.200
practice balancing equations.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.780
So let's go back to the
original problem.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.716
We're given 34 grams
of ammonia.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.020
So what we need to figure out
is how many moles of ammonia

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.750
were we given?

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.000
So what's the atomic
mass of ammonia?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.300
Not the atomic mass, what's the
molecular mass of ammonia?

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.790
We're dealing with nitrogen
14, so it has a

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.340
mass number of 14.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.560
Hydrogen has a mass
number of 1.

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:36.650
So each nitrogen has
a mass of 14.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.290
And then the hydrogens each
have a mass of 1.

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.820
Remember, hydrogen is
kind of strange.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.890
It doesn't have neutrons,
or at least in its most

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:43.780
traditional form.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.130
So it has just a mass
number of 1.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.790
It's just a proton and an
electron if it's neutral.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.110
So this is 3 times 1.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.570
We have three hydrogen atoms. So
the mass, the atomic mass,

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.720
of one molecule of ammonia
is 14 plus 3 is

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.770
17 atomic mass units.

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.670
Or, another way to write that,
if one molecule of ammonia is

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:14.990
17 atomic mass units,
then 1 mole of

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.300
ammonia is how many grams?

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.590
It's going to be 17 grams.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.440
So how many moles of ammonia
are we given?

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.990
We're given 34 grams of ammonia,
1 mole is 17 grams.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.470
So we're given 2 moles.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:33.020
34 is 2 times 17.

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.070
So this is 2 moles.

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.480
We're given 2 moles
of ammonia.

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.400
Let's see how much oxygen
we're given.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.490
Or how much of the molecular
oxygen we've been

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.160
given in this case.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.660
So let's see, the mass of just
oxygen by itself is 16.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.590
The mass of just the atomic
oxygen, you have to be a

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.050
little bit careful here because
sometimes people say

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:01.340
we have 32 grams of oxygen when
they're really talking

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.010
about the molecular oxygen.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.540
Well, I guess it doesn't
matter either way.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.640
But, sometimes when they talk
about oxygen you have to make

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.890
sure whether it is molecular
or atomic oxygen.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:14.585
But the atomic mass number
of oxygen is 16.

00:07:14.585 --> 00:07:17.160
I can confirm that
by looking at the

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.670
periodic table down here.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:26.710
So what's the molecular mass of
the diatomic molecule O2?

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.110
Well it has 2 oxygen, so it's
going to be 2 times 16 equals

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:33.880
32 atomic mass units.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.130
One molecule of O2 is 32
atomic mass units.

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:44.730
Or 1 mole of O2 is
how many grams?

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:49.690
Well if one molecule is 32
atomic mass units, then 6

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.450
times 10 to the 23 of that
molecule are going to be that

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.970
many grams. 32 grams. So how
many moles of oxygen have we

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.070
been given?

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.990
We've been given exactly 32
grams of oxygen, which is

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:04.500
exactly 1 mole.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.140
So we've been given 34 grams of
ammonia, which is 2 moles.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.880
Let me write that in a
nice vibrant color.

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:23.750
And we've been given 1 mole
of the oxygen molecule.

00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:28.780
Now, when we look at this
reaction, for every 4 moles of

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:32.179
ammonia, we need 5
moles of oxygen.

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:36.159
Or for every 5 moles of oxygen
we need 4 moles of ammonia.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.080
So something doesn't gel here.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.020
Normally, we need more
moles of oxygen

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:41.350
than we have ammonia.

00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.930
In the example that we're
working through, we've been

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.350
given less moles of oxygen
than ammonia.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:50.290
We've been given less
oxygen than we need

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.000
for all of this ammonia.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.850
In an ideal world, if we had 2
moles of ammonia, we would

00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:59.260
need 2.5 moles of oxygen.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.820
The ratio of ammonia
to oxygen, let

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.170
me write that down.

00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:04.440
In a different color, this
is getting boring.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:12.000
The ratio of ammonia, NH3 to
oxygen in our balanced

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.780
equation, let me put that in a
square so you know this is the

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.260
most important part of
what I'm writing.

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.680
The ratio in this
reaction is 4:5.

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.680
So if I'm given 2 moles
of ammonia,

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.150
this is equal to what?

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:34.040
If I'm given 2 moles of ammonia,
how many moles of

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:34.970
oxygen do I need?

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:38.550
I need 2.5 moles of oxygen.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:41.240
Whatever this is,
is that right?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.750
Yeah, 4/5.

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.810
1.25.

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:48.240
If you doubled both of these
numbers, you get 4/5.

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.530
So I need 2.5 moles.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.490
But I don't have 2.5
moles of oxygen.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:53.460
I only have 1 mole of oxygen.

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:55.580
So oxygen is going to
be the limiting

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.860
reagent in this reaction.

00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:00.410
I don't have enough oxygen.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.060
I have plenty of ammonia, but I
don't have enough oxygen to

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:03.680
react with it.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.930
So this is the limiting
reagent.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.080
And I said before, the word
reagent and reactant are used

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:12.435
interchangeably.

00:10:12.435 --> 00:10:14.620
But when people talk about the
limiting ones, they tend to

00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:16.190
call it the reagent.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:17.800
So oxygen is the limiting
reagent.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.190
So we have extra ammonia.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:23.280
So given that we have 1 mole of
oxygen, how many moles of

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.260
ammonia can I react with that?

00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:33.260
So this reaction is going to
look something like this.

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:35.170
I only have 1 mole of oxygen.

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:40.150
So instead of 5O2, I
have to write 1O2.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.905
Let me make sure that's
not of 10.

00:10:42.905 --> 00:10:46.560
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.120
I only have 1O2 instead
of 5O2.

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.040
So how many ammonia are going
to react with that?

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.760
Well the ratio is 4:5.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.890
So I'm going to have
0.8 ammonia.

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:01.050
4 is to 5 as 0.8 is to 1.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:05.240
And so essentially, if I take
this whole equation up here

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.740
and divide it by 5,
I'll get what's

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.230
actually going to happen.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:13.640
So this divided by
5 is 0.8, nitric

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.430
oxide or nitrogen monoxide.

00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:21.080
Plus 6/5 moles of H2O.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:24.960
And so the original question in
the beginning is, how many

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.870
grams of nitric oxide
are we going to

00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:30.400
produce, or nitrogen monoxide?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:36.890
So we have 1 mole of oxygen,
0.8 moles of ammonia, and

00:11:36.890 --> 00:11:45.500
we're going to produce 0.8 moles
of nitrogen monoxide.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:47.000
Because we only have
one oxygen.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.010
So 0.8 moles of nitric oxide
or nitrogen monoxide.

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:57.055
So what's the atomic
mass, the molecular

00:11:57.055 --> 00:12:00.250
mass, of nitrogen monoxide?

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:05.040
Nitrogen has 14 atomic
mass units.

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.880
Oxygen is 16.

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:09.690
We've done that before.

00:12:09.690 --> 00:12:13.260
But you can confirm, your oxygen
is 16, nitrogen is 14.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:26.460
So one molecule of nitrogen
monoxide is equal to 30 atomic

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.150
mass units.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:37.360
1 mole or 6.02 times 10 to the
23 molecules of nitrogen

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:42.285
monoxide, therefore, will be 30
grams. And how many moles

00:12:42.285 --> 00:12:44.070
are we producing in
this reaction?

00:12:44.070 --> 00:12:47.100
Because oxygen was the limiting
reagent, we only had

00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.250
1 mole of oxygen here.

00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:51.270
Because of that, we can
only produce 0.8

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.710
moles of nitrogen monoxide.

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:58.190
So 0.8 moles of nitrogen
monoxide, 1 mole is 30 grams.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:07.050
So 0.8 moles of NO is going to
be equal to 0.8 times 30,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:16.140
which is equal to 24 grams. So
we're going to be able to

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:19.240
produce 24 grams of
nitrogen monoxide.

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:25.720
And so you might ask a question,
we're only using 0.8

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.950
moles of ammonia.

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:33.210
We were given, in the original
problem, 2 moles of ammonia,

00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:35.790
so what happens with all
the leftover ammonia?

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.740
Assuming we mix it really good,
we're going to literally

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:41.250
end up with 1.2 moles of
ammonia just doing

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.370
nothing at the end.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:47.570
So we're going to have 24
grams of nitric oxide.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:55.370
And then we used 0.8
moles of ammonia.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:14:02.430
And we're going to have left
1.2 moles of ammonia.

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:04.780
And if you want, you can figure
out how many of the

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:06.670
original grams of
ammonia that is.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:09.760
You just figure out how many
grams 1 mole of ammonia is,

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:13.680
it's 17 grams. And then just
multiply that times 1.2.

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.260
Anyway, I hope you found
that interesting.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.750
If you found this a little bit
confusing, just watch the

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.960
video again and pause it and
try to solve it yourself.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.810
But I think it should start
making a little bit of

00:14:22.810 --> 00:14:23.810
intuitive sense.

00:14:23.810 --> 00:14:26.125
I think the hard part is just
the conversions between moles

00:14:26.125 --> 00:14:28.020
and grams and getting
that part right.

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:30.510
And then making sure that you
understand the ratios.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:33.550
You understand this is a 4:5
ratio, there's always going to

00:14:33.550 --> 00:14:35.070
be less ammonia than oxygen.

00:14:35.070 --> 00:14:38.030
And if I only have 1 mole of
oxygen, I'm going to have to

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.320
have less than 1 mole
of ammonia, even

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.760
though I was given 2.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.120
So oxygen, in this example, was
the rate limiting factor.

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:51.520
Let's say I had 10 moles of
oxygen and 2 moles of ammonia.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:53.350
In that case, ammonia
would have been the

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:54.230
rate limiting factor.

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.110
Because then I would have had
more than enough oxygen.

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:57.810
Because for 2 moles of
ammonia, I only need

00:14:57.810 --> 00:14:59.690
2.5 moles of oxygen.

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:01.510
So 10 moles would have
been overkill.

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.800
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
