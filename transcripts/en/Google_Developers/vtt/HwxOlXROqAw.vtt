00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.070
DANIEL: Hi there.

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:02.750
I'm Daniel Sieberg
with I/O Live.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.440
And we are in the Nexus lounge
of Androidville.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.189
And we're going to be talking
about a number of different

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.140
devices and services that are
all tied to your content, how

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.870
you get it, where you can view
it on different devices.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.750
Plus, we're going to give you
a look at the Q right now,

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.830
which is super cool.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.790
It just got delivered
here to I/O in a

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:23.710
very dramatic fashion.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.400
I'm joined now by Justin.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.150
Justin, introduce yourself for
the folks, first of all.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.460
JUSTIN KOH: Hi there.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.270
My name's Justin.

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.530
I'm a software engineer on Nexus
Q. And I work on both

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.750
the software on the Android
device that controls it, as

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.560
well as the software
and the Q itself.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.100
DANIEL: All right.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.900
Well, we're all blown away
by how it got delivered.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.340
But perhaps even more so, the
technology that's in there and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.190
how people can use it is
relevant to folks out there.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.550
We can see it behind us.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.630
It's hooked up to the device
that you've got here, which is

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:48.780
the Nexus 7.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.900
So give us a little spin here.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.430
If you want to share
your content--

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.700
let's just imagine this
is our living room.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.210
JUSTIN KOH: Great.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.420
DANIEL: And you want to
share that with folks.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.960
How would you do that with
music, first of all?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.250
JUSTIN KOH: Great.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.670
So I'm here in the music app.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.800
And looking at the Nexus Q
and I'm looking at what

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.440
song's coming up.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.870
And I decided, you know what?

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.379
We should play something else.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.920
So I can come back here and I
see all of the songs that are

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.600
in my Google Play
music library.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.236
DANIEL: Sir, turn that if you
can just a little bit for

00:01:11.236 --> 00:01:11.720
folks to see.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.920
Got a list of all your
songs there.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.520
JUSTIN KOH: Right.

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.500
And so I can just select one
and say, add to Media Room,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.460
which is the name of our Nexus
Q, and it will play up next.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.850
But let's say that
we're impatient.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.320
We want to play it right away.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.600
I can just go down there, find
it in our Q and hit, hit.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.710
And you can see that we start
playing it right away.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.990
DANIEL: That's very cool.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.810
JUSTIN KOH: But what's
even cooler--

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.380
DANIEL: Yes?

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.650
JUSTIN KOH: Is that if you had
your Android device hooked up

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.310
and you had the Nexus Q app,
you could go through your

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.410
music library.

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.630
You could find your
own tracks.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.590
And you could add it
to my Q as well.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.540
And so we could be listening
to both of our

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.370
music at the same time.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:44.950
DANIEL: So it's sharing that
experience together.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:45.490
JUSTIN KOH: Sharing
that experience.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.770
Right.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.040
You just downloaded a new album
and you want to tell me

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.130
about the best track on it,
you can just show it to me

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.600
right away.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.240
DANIEL: That's very cool.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.770
And now, music is one thing,
which is obviously great for a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.920
social environment.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.570
Video.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.840
So if it was, say,
a YouTube clip.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.280
JUSTIN KOH: Excellent.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.860
DANIEL: Would you do
the same thing?

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.590
JUSTIN KOH: Yep.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.610
So in YouTube, I think there's
a new video today that I

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.670
really want to see and I really
want to show you.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.620
So let's just search
for Google Nexus.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.035
And we've got the Introducing
Nexus 7, which also got

00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:13.170
introduced today.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.700
We just tap on our Android
Beam icon up here

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.920
and then hit play.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.780
And you can see that we'll be
showing each other hilarious

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.560
cat videos and product videos.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.490
DANIEL: Not more cat videos.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.950
JUSTIN KOH: Not more
cat videos.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.920
DANIEL: And all the content you
can get on YouTube, you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.990
can just share it with anybody
who wants to see it here?

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.720
JUSTIN KOH: Exactly.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.690
And you can share it,
I can share it.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.310
And moving on from YouTube, we
can actually do the same thing

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.735
with the new Google Play
movies content.

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.160
So that's movies that you've
purchased, movies that you've

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.060
rented, or TV shows.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.635
And you can share that all on
the big screen with everybody

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:44.430
who's watching.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.780
DANIEL: All right.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.480
Let's talk a little bit about
the Q itself, the device.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.095
JUSTIN KOH: Sure.

00:02:47.095 --> 00:02:48.530
DANIEL: Who makes it?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.026
What are some of the
cool specs you can

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:50.570
share with us on it?

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.100
JUSTIN KOH: So Google
makes it.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.880
And this is really exciting
because it's the first piece

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.700
of consumer hardware that Google
designed in-house and

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.000
is manufacturing.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.870
So the Nexus Q has an OMAP 4
processor inside, which is the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.630
same chip that's inside
the Galaxy Nexus.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.130
And so you can imagine
with all that power.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.900
Or we can deliver a 10 AP video
to the best screen and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.560
speakers in the house.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.890
The Nexus Q is also hooked up
for just being a music device

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:16.670
if you'd like.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.660
You can hook it up using
[? split off ?]

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.330
optical audio out.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.980
Or it also has a 25-watt digital
amplifier that you can

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.000
connect directly to speakers.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.745
And just spread Q all
over the house.

00:03:28.745 --> 00:03:31.610
DANIEL: So there's a lot of
power packed into that

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.605
relatively small device.

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:33.500
JUSTIN KOH: Exactly.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.800
And they work well with
each other as well.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.300
So if you have multiple Nexus
Q's in your house, they will

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.430
play music all synced
up at the same time.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.030
DANIEL: And that's, I guess,
the beauty of it as well.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.565
It's meant to be
very seamless.

00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:44.270
JUSTIN KOH: Exactly.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.250
DANIEL: People don't have to
set up a lot of things and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.660
find out how to integrate it.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:48.960
Out of the box it's
working for you.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.950
JUSTIN KOH: Exactly.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.530
Nexus Q is meant to
live in your home.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.430
It's meant to be unobtrusive
when you

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.100
don't want to be there.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.450
But when you want it there, it
can really put on a slideshow.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.130
DANIEL: All right.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.000
Anything else you wanted to show
us with the 7 while we've

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.806
got it here?

00:03:59.806 --> 00:04:01.648
JUSTIN KOH: I think one of
my friends might be able

00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:02.000
to help with that.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.510
DANIEL: OK.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.420
Well, as a matter of fact,
we're going to

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:04.685
talk about Play first.

00:04:04.685 --> 00:04:06.650
So Justin, thank you so
much, by the way.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.365
JUSTIN KOH: You're welcome.

00:04:07.365 --> 00:04:07.685
DANIEL: That was fantastic.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:08.850
And we'll just let this play.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.200
Are we safe to let this
video keep playing?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:10.900
Should we put some music on?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.510
JUSTIN KOH: Oh.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.340
DANIEL: Let's put
some music on.

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.800
JUSTIN KOH: Let's put
some music back on.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.700
DANIEL: Some sort of mood music
to set the scene here.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:15.110
JUSTIN KOH: All right.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.980
Back to our playlist.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.300
And let's just go right
back up here.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.720
And we'll just go right back--

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.395
DANIEL: Oh, very cool.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:24.190
Some Rolling Stones?

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.870
Nice job.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:25.040
All right.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.800
Justin, thank you so much
for dropping by.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.290
That's great.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.910
JUSTIN KOH: Have a good day.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:28.970
DANIEL: And Nicole,
come on up here.

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.950
This is like our guest couch
and you're the next one to

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:31.590
talk to us.

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.980
NICOLE PLANA: I know.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.400
DANIEL: You're gonna kind
of stitch all of this

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.250
together for us.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.820
Because Play, where people get a
lot of this content from, is

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:38.750
what we're going to
talk about now.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.120
So how would you describe Play
to someone who's either

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.750
unfamiliar with it or maybe
wants to know more?

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.650
NICOLE PLANA: So I would
describe Play as your store

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.560
for all your entertainment.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.960
On Play we feature apps, music,
movies, books, and we

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.260
now feature television
shows and magazines.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.910
DANIEL: Cool.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.330
Well, we got a look at some
of the music stuff.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.470
And we'll get into that
in just a second.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.080
But if you want to talk a little
bit more about each of

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.950
these-- we're going to
call them verticals.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:03.500
NICOLE PLANA: Sure.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.750
DANIEL: Different content,
multimedia content, that

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.405
people want to consume.

00:05:06.405 --> 00:05:07.085
NICOLE PLANA: Yeah.

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:09.410
DANIEL: Do you want to start
with talking about apps in

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.210
particular, maybe?

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.390
NICOLE PLANA: Sure.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:14.750
So I'm Google Play I can just
open apps right now.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.840
We have over 600,000 apps and
games and a wide variety of

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.330
types of apps and games.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.290
So users can check their stocks,
read their news, or

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.395
just play a game on their
tablet or device.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:29.720
DANIEL: And games-- very,
very popular in

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.930
the apps store, right?

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:31.490
NICOLE PLANA: Definitely.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.220
DANIEL: It's one of
the big ones.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.130
NICOLE PLANA: Definitely.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:37.290
DANIEL: And in terms of
multimedia content like music,

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:40.365
what are some of the new
features with finding music in

00:05:40.365 --> 00:05:40.650
the Play store?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.620
NICOLE PLANA: Yeah.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.970
Music is definitely something
we're very excited about.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:46.470
We feature millions of tracks.

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.640
And another really cool feature
about music is we

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.800
offer personalization.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.450
So we make suggestions based on
what you're listening to.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:55.540
DANIEL: Oh, that's very cool.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.010
Yeah, I'm a big user of
Google Play myself.

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.970
I get most of my music from
there these days.

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.080
It's fantastic.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.265
And those recommendations,
I think, is really cool.

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:03.815
NICOLE PLANA: Great.

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:04.330
Yeah, definitely.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.135
DANIEL: OK, so now we talked
about apps and music.

00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:10.760
How about movies and TV shows?

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.480
NICOLE PLANA: Yeah.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.920
So we offer hundreds
of thousands of

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.550
movies and TV shows.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.250
TV shows is something new for
Play that we just launched.

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.740
And it allows users to catch
up on all their favorite

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:25.350
programs, like Breaking Bad
or Parks and Recreation.

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.950
DANIEL: Cool.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.000
And then finally books,
of course.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:28.985
Very, very popular.

00:06:28.985 --> 00:06:29.715
NICOLE PLANA: Definitely.

00:06:29.715 --> 00:06:31.420
DANIEL: Easy to get
and download.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.170
NICOLE PLANA: Yeah.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.080
DANIEL: What's new in
the books world?

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.830
NICOLE PLANA: Books is actually
the largest ebook

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.010
store in the world.

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.030
And we offer a wide
variety of genres.

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:42.190
So it appeals to everybody.

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.925
So we have cookbooks, fiction,
biographies.

00:06:44.925 --> 00:06:45.620
DANIEL: Cool.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.387
So maybe you could just hold
that up for the camera so we

00:06:47.387 --> 00:06:47.650
can get a see.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.230
This is what the whole Play
interface looks like.

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:54.150
Maybe hold it up just a little
bit higher for the camera.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.680
There you go.

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.900
NICOLE PLANA: Music.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.800
And also magazines, which
is something new.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.390
And magazines is also something
that we try to

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.260
appeal to everybody.

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:06.270
So we have magazines on
photography, health.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:09.340
In the area of health we have
Shape and Men's Health

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.570
featured on magazines
right now.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:13.840
DANIEL: And just to be clear,
folks can get this content on

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.000
any of the Android devices.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.250
NICOLE PLANA: Yes.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:16.940
DANIEL: I have a Nexus Galaxy.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:17.930
Phone, full disclosure.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:19.610
We have a Nexus 7 here.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:21.730
But that's part of the beauty
of getting this, is you can

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.665
access it on these different
devices and share it.

00:07:23.665 --> 00:07:25.060
NICOLE PLANA: You can.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:27.780
You can access whatever you
purchase on your account, as

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:29.620
long as the account's
on the device.

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:30.340
DANIEL: Very cool.

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:31.740
All right, anything else you
wanted to mention while we've

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.210
got you here?

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.460
NICOLE PLANA: No, I think
we covered it all.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.250
Thank you very much.

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:34.540
DANIEL: All right.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:34.623
Well, thank you very much.

00:07:34.623 --> 00:07:36.495
I'm going to send it to
the output couch now.

00:07:36.495 --> 00:07:36.940
NICOLE PLANA: OK.

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:38.470
DANIEL: And our final
guest from the

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.040
input couch, Krithika.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.560
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Hi.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.520
DANIEL: How are you?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:41.900
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Good.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.560
DANIEL: And you have got in your
hand something that a lot

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.100
of folks want to get
their hands on.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:45.490
This is the Nexus 7.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:46.270
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Yeah.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.780
You guys have gotten a bit of a
glimpse of it watching the Q

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.140
demo and the Play demo.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.390
But I'd really like to get into
the hardware of this.

00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.690
DANIEL: Yeah.

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.530
Well, introduce yourself
to folks so they

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:55.430
know who you are.

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.390
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: So I'm
Krithika Muthukumar.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:58.980
And I'm a Product Marketing
Manager on Android.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.990
And I've been working
on the Nexus 7 and

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:01.980
bringing this to you guys.

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:02.790
DANIEL: OK.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.665
So power it up for us here.

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:06.120
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: So
actually, first I'd like to

00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:10.025
show you that you can get
into your tablet just

00:08:10.025 --> 00:08:10.890
by using your face.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:11.360
DANIEL: Oh.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.900
See, it saw my face there and
it got a little concerned.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:14.435
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: So it saw
your face and it didn't

00:08:14.435 --> 00:08:14.860
recognize you.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.200
Let's try mine.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:17.640
And I'm in.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.060
DANIEL: Hey.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.870
And it worked even with me kind
of like leering over your

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:20.475
shoulder there.

00:08:20.475 --> 00:08:22.450
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: And right
up front is all of my favorite

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:23.990
content from Google Play.

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:26.690
So this tablet is really
made for Google Play

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.330
from start to finish.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:34.659
And starting with the vibrant
seven-inch display and the

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:37.500
corning glass that's
around this.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.080
And you can just enjoy
your HD movies in

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.780
brilliant clarity here.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.270
So actually let me just jump
into one of these movies.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:47.790
I just get right into Play and
start watching a movie.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.760
So it's just that simple.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.970
DANIEL: That's very,
very cool.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.310
Now obviously there's
a front-facing

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:52.470
camera on there as well?

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:53.210
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR:
That's correct.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.205
DANIEL: Of course which is
needed to recognize you.

00:08:54.205 --> 00:08:55.940
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: So using
the front-facing camera you

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:57.530
can do Hangouts, you
can chat with your

00:08:57.530 --> 00:08:58.710
friends and video chat.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.475
So that's another part of it.

00:09:00.475 --> 00:09:02.020
DANIEL: That's very,
very exciting.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.580
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Exactly.

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:03.630
DANIEL: To be able to do
these kind of mobile

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:04.290
Hangouts would be cool.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.980
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: I actually
talked with my

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:08.450
grandma the other day,
who's in Singapore.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:12.290
And she was on her cell phone
and I was on my tablet.

00:09:12.290 --> 00:09:12.850
DANIEL: Really?

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.790
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: And we
had a Hangout right there.

00:09:13.790 --> 00:09:14.350
DANIEL: That's fascinating.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.340
And for people who don't know,
a Hangout is this up to 10

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.390
people video chat for Google+.

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:17.770
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Right.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.770
You can Hangout with up to nine
of your friends at the

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:22.025
same time right through
Google+.

00:09:22.025 --> 00:09:23.342
DANIEL: That's very cool.

00:09:23.342 --> 00:09:25.140
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: The other
thing that I'd like to show

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:32.020
off to you guys is just that
it's built with Android 4.1

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:35.150
Jelly Bean, which is the latest
of the world's most

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:37.930
popular mobile platform.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:41.100
And it's just smooth and fast.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.740
And it's got some cool new
features like a new search

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.200
interface and Google Now, which
brings you just the

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.720
right information that you need
without you even having

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.946
to ask for it.

00:09:51.946 --> 00:09:54.230
DANIEL: Now I see Chrome on
there as well, of course.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.710
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Exactly.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:55.795
So Chrome is the browser
of choice.

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.550
So you can browse the
web Chrome-fast.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:01.050
You can also get any of the
other Google mobile apps.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.210
It's really the best
of Google on your

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:06.556
tablet and mobile device.

00:10:06.556 --> 00:10:08.390
DANIEL: Have you had a lot of
fun playing around with this,

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:08.710
by the way?

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:09.850
Because you look
like you have.

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:10.180
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Yeah.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.440
DANIEL: You've got a chance to
see this stuff before lot of

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:12.900
other people.

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:13.870
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR:
That's true.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.760
I've got my demo device here.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.570
You guys will see the little
number up here.

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.190
I've had a chance to play with
it for the past month and a

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.930
half or so.

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:23.780
And I find myself just enjoying
content more.

00:10:23.780 --> 00:10:26.730
It is really built for all
your entertainment and

00:10:26.730 --> 00:10:27.320
enjoying it.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.320
So I've read a couple of
the books that came

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:30.730
preloaded on here.

00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:34.510
I've seen Transformers
3 a couple of times.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.135
And actually I even checked out
the Food Network magazine.

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:37.850
DANIEL: OK.

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:38.680
You were doing research.

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.940
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: And
found a good recipe.

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:40.945
DANIEL: You were
doing research.

00:10:40.945 --> 00:10:41.520
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Exactly.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.100
DANIEL: Yeah, yeah.

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:43.030
I understand.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.300
And so give me some of the
technical specifications of

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:46.940
this too that people
are curious about.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:47.210
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Sure.

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.780
So this has got a Tegra 3 Quad
core processor from Nvidia.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:54.580
It's made by ASUS, one of the
leading manufacturers of

00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.090
hardware devices.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:01.170
And other technical specs that
you'd want to know is that

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:04.050
it's got the 1.2 megapixel
front-facing camera.

00:11:04.050 --> 00:11:06.380
So you'll look great when you're
video chatting with

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:07.192
your friends.

00:11:07.192 --> 00:11:08.320
DANIEL: It's very, very cool.

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.680
Anything else you wanted to show
us on it while we've got

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.260
you here and a captive
audience?

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:15.390
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: So the
other part of this experience

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:18.310
is really for Play.

00:11:18.310 --> 00:11:19.790
And you've seen a bit of it.

00:11:19.790 --> 00:11:22.400
But I think the consumption
part of it, not just the

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.700
store, has also been
optimized for this.

00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.600
So as a seven-inch tablet,
it's really perfect.

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:30.570
It's thin, light, and portable
and it fits in your hand.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:33.170
You can just open up an
ebook and immediately

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:34.740
start reading it.

00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:37.955
And the display makes it really
easy to read as well.

00:11:37.955 --> 00:11:39.165
DANIEL: That's very,
very cool.

00:11:39.165 --> 00:11:40.420
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR:
Whether it's at

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:41.200
night or you're hiding--

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.956
DANIEL: It's got to be
very light, right?

00:11:41.956 --> 00:11:43.010
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR:
Super light.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:44.480
DANIEL: That is incredibly
light.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.770
Do you know exactly how
much that weighs?

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.460
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: I
don't want to guess.

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:50.755
But you can find the specs
at google.com/nexus.

00:11:50.755 --> 00:11:51.570
DANIEL: OK.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:54.160
And availability, price, tell
us all about that stuff.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.190
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: It is
ready to pre-order today.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:59.180
And it's available in either an
8 gig or a 16 gig version.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.300
So even though Google Play is
made for the cloud and you can

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:06.090
store all of your entertainment
without needing

00:12:06.090 --> 00:12:08.850
the hard drive, you can still
store a lot of your favorite

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.190
content and keep it when you're
away from your internet

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:13.535
connection.

00:12:13.535 --> 00:12:14.010
DANIEL: OK.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:15.870
And I assume this all
works together.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:18.050
We've talked about Play,
which we've seen.

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:20.090
And the Q. This can
already be--

00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.780
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR:
Absolutely.

00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.100
This is a Nexus device.

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.580
So it brings the best of Google
to your mobile device.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.480
DANIEL: That's great.

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.200
Well, I'm going to bring
you two guys back

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.260
up here for a second.

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.080
Since we have a little
more time left.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.510
Anything else you guys wanted
to mention while

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:35.370
we've got you here?

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.170
I'm just fascinated by
all this cool stuff.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:40.790
And we're hearing some of the
music right now thanks to Q.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:42.080
Anything else you guys want
to throw out there?

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:42.790
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: Yeah.

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:44.270
I think the best part is
actually playing with a bunch

00:12:44.270 --> 00:12:45.660
of your friends.

00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:47.900
The Q is the first social
streaming media player, so you

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:53.010
can bring your device to the
party and just start playing.

00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:53.470
JUSTIN KOH: Right.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.190
I think it's great how the
products work well together.

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:59.210
You've got the tablet when
you're using your personal

00:12:59.210 --> 00:13:00.910
consumption, and then when you
want to share with other

00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:02.420
people that's what Q's for.

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.860
DANIEL: And there's all
that content in Play

00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:04.470
whenever you want it.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.840
NICOLE PLANA: Exactly.

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.670
So you can share your content.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.670
Again, if you bring your device
to a party, you can go

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:10.400
back and forth between who
selects the music.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.276
So I think it's a really
great way to

00:13:13.276 --> 00:13:14.902
integrate all the products.

00:13:14.902 --> 00:13:16.310
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR: One thing
I did want to mention is that

00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:18.660
it's also fun to play
games on this.

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:22.040
It's got a gyroscope and an
accelerometer, so it's got all

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.400
of the things you'd want to
really dive in and use that

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.210
entertainment.

00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:27.010
DANIEL: Cool.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:30.060
And then you could have that
experience, potentially, on

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.640
the big screen?

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.400
JUSTIN KOH: Can't say for now.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:33.250
DANIEL: OK.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:34.020
That's all right.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:34.530
That's fine.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.950
Well, thank you to
each of you.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:38.800
Maybe just say your name
again so everybody

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.490
knows who you were.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.920
KRITHIKA MUTHUKUMAR:
I'm Krithika.

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:41.300
NICOLE PLANA: Nicole.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:41.780
JUSTIN KOH: I'm Justin.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:42.530
DANIEL: All right.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:44.560
This is our little party here
and we're going to keep

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.120
hanging out.

00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.020
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:50.000
That's Play, the Q,
and the Nexus 7.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.120
Check them all out.

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.370
Stay tuned for lots more
here on I/O Live.
