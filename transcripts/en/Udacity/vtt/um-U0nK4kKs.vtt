In some sense the trend in web pages--

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
in the beginning it was only really technical people who could make their own webpages,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and now it's getting easier and easier to just make use of sites that exist

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to put up a webpage of your own.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Could you imagine social networking somehow going that way as well,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
where people can just try out and make their own little social networks just like blogs?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So, people go on things like Twitter,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
because you have so many people you can actually mine information from.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
That's what people do when you search the search tags on Twitter or on Facebook

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
or on Google+ is actually you're mining the social network.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You're getting information from the network itself, not just from the webpages.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Creating your own, unless there is a specific use for it--

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
so, let's say you were doing a medical practitioners network in the U.S.A--

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
maybe that would be useful, because then you already have a target audience,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
but just making a general social network will probably be harder and harder

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
as time goes on, because the big ones will steamroll over the other ones.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But it's interesting, though, with the blogs and being able to come out with your own blogs now,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
there are more and more tools now to integrate them into such networks.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Right now when I do blog, it actually posts everything everywhere--

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on Twitter, on Facebook, and on Google +.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
And while you go to the blog, you can actually then share from all these different networks.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So, the web is becoming more social.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I don't think the need to create new social networks is that big

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
unless you already have a target audience that you can actually reach.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Do you have a feel for the direction these trends are taking us?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What do you think the future of crunching social networks might look like?

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
What I've learned in the last year or so is that everything is experimental.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
People try it out and then we see what works. Some things don't work.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So, at the moment, the future is unwritten.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.000
There is going to be a lot of innovation in the next few months to a year,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
because there's a big battle, as you see.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
A lot of social networks now are starting to get tied into a lot of other products

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
that are being put out on the Internet.
