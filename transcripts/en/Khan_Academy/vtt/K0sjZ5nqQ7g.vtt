00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.150
We've talked a
lot about mirrors,

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.110
in particular parabolic
mirrors, that reflect light.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.740
What I want to do now
is talk about lenses,

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.270
or talk about what a lens is.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.830
And think about how they
transmit or refract light.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.690
So a simple lens, and
we've all seen them.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.930
Maybe it's made of glass,
maybe something else.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.440
And I'm going to focus
on convex lenses first.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.140
So remember, concave means
it opens inward, like a cave.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.900
Convex means it kind
of opens outward.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.110
And in a convex lens,
it'll be symmetric.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.610
So let me see if I can draw it.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.711
One side of the lens
will look like that.

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:39.460
And this one, you could
kind of view this.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.480
And oftentimes, most
lenses, the simpler lenses,

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.430
are made this way.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.770
So this is kind of the
surface of a sphere,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.250
or part of the
surface of a sphere.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.660
Let me see if I can draw
that a little bit better.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.740
So part of the surface of a
sphere, and it's symmetric.

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.010
So it has some center, right
over here, just like that.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.110
And then you have
another surface

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.575
of a sphere that's
exactly the same.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:08.860
I'm doing my best to draw this
convex lens, just like that.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.254
That is a pretty good job here.

00:01:12.254 --> 00:01:14.170
And let me copy and paste
it so I can actually

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.340
use this drawing in the
future, before I mark it up.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.860
All right.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.845
So I've copied it.

00:01:19.845 --> 00:01:21.220
So let's think
about what's going

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.620
to happen as light
goes through this lens,

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.150
as it's transmitted
through it and maybe gets

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.800
diffracted by it.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.250
So we're assuming this is air
out here, and this is glass.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.680
Something that has a higher
index of refraction, something

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.510
in which light travels slower.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.140
So you can imagine
that some light that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.140
is going parallel-- I
guess you could view it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.020
to the principal
axis of the lens.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.940
This would be the principal
axis of the lens right here,

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.140
just like we talked
about the principal axis

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.890
of our parabolic mirrors.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.690
But if you imagine light
that's going parallel to that,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.160
right when it hits this
surface over here-- Remember,

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.390
the perpendicular
at this point is

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.170
going to look like this because
the lens is actually curved.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.575
And remember, it's moving
faster on the outside.

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:07.450
So the right side is
going to be able to stay

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.660
outside a little bit longer.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.480
Or actually I should
say, the top side

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.509
of the light-- if you
imagine the car analogy--

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:16.300
is going to be able to
stay out of the lens

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.200
a little bit longer
than the bottom side,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.110
or the bottom wheels.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.490
Or if we go in the
direction of the light,

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.230
the left side of the car
is going to be able to--

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.875
And just so we can visualize the
car, there's the left wheels.

00:02:28.875 --> 00:02:30.000
Those are the right wheels.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.999
The left wheels are going
to be able to stay out

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:35.210
a little bit longer and travel
faster a little bit longer.

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.290
So this is the
perpendicular again.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.630
So it will it be
refracted downwards

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.254
like that, a little bit.

00:02:44.254 --> 00:02:45.920
And then once you get
to this interface,

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.860
now you're going to move into
a faster medium, into the air

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.750
again.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.230
And let me draw our
perpendicular over here.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.200
And you could imagine that
the right side of this ray

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:09.010
is going to-- Actually,
the left side of this ray

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.800
is going to come out first.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.880
And since the left side of
this ray, or the left side

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.790
of these tires are
going to come out first,

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.060
or maybe the top tires are
going to come out first,

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.150
they're going to be
able to travel faster.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.610
And so you'll be deflected
even more downwards.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.190
So it will look
something like this.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:34.670
And the light ray would
do something like that.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.300
Now there is a point
out here someplace

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.540
that whenever I take
any ray that is parallel

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.760
to the principal
axis of the lens,

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.430
it will be refracted through
the lens to that same point.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.930
So here, we're going
to be refracted

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.930
a little bit like that.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.500
And there we'll
be refracted more.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.550
And then we're going to
go to that same point.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.240
So that's another ray.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.400
And then this is
another parallel ray.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.510
It'll be refracted a
little bit over here,

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.640
and then a little bit more.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.490
And it'll go to that same point.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:13.080
And I think you could guess what
I'm about to call this point.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.959
I wish I could draw my lines
a little bit straighter.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.500
It's refracted a
little bit, and then

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.124
refracted a little bit more, and
goes straight into that point.

00:04:20.124 --> 00:04:22.720
This point, where all of the
parallel rays-- Sometimes

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.850
you'll hear them talked
of as collimated rays.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.740
Those are rays of light
that are roughly parallel.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.680
They all converge at this point
on the other side of the lens.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.010
They're essentially all
being focused on that point.

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:42.600
And this right here you can
view as the focus of the lens.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.080
Or you can view this
length from the lens

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.290
to that point as
the focal length.

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.660
Now this lens is
completely symmetric.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.130
Anything you can
do from one side,

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.010
you end up getting
focused on the right side.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.450
If you had collimated
rays, or parallel rays,

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.395
coming from the right side,
the same thing would happen.

00:05:01.395 --> 00:05:03.020
But it would just be
on the other side.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.740
So that ray would go like that.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.000
And then it would be
refracted some more.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.450
And maybe it would go to
this point, right over here.

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:17.810
And so you actually have
two foci for a lens.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.400
Two actual points where,
if parallel rays are coming

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.199
from one side,
they'll be focused

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:24.490
on the point on the other side.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.010
And if parallel arrays are
coming from the left side,

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.590
they'll be focused
at the focal length

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:33.952
or at the focus point
on the right-hand side.

00:05:33.952 --> 00:05:35.410
And this goes the
other way around.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.034
Let me draw another lens.

00:05:38.034 --> 00:05:39.450
And actually, one
thing that we're

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.730
going to assume while
we're dealing with lenses,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.700
and this is kind of a
simplifying assumption,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.600
is called a thin
lens assumption.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.030
There is a difference
in distance

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.440
it travels, depending on where
the light travels in the lens.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.330
For example, here there's
less distance than over here.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.477
And in an introductory
physics-- and we're

00:05:58.477 --> 00:06:00.060
going to do that
here, as well-- we're

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.101
just going to ignore that
difference in distance,

00:06:02.101 --> 00:06:06.200
because that would lead to some
differences in how the light is

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.950
refracted and transmitted
and all of that.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.780
Because it has to
travel a smaller

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.100
distance here than over here.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:13.300
So we're going to ignore
those differences,

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.980
and we're just going to make
the thin lens assumption.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.800
But using a thin
lens assumption,

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.550
let's think a little
bit about what's

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.010
going to happen with the light.

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:22.150
And in the next
few examples, I'm

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:23.780
not going to worry about
this kind of two-step.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.738
I'm just going to say,
look, it just in general

00:06:25.738 --> 00:06:29.820
gets refracted in that direction
when it exits the lens.

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.570
So let me just draw a
simple lens right over here.

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.410
It is symmetric.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.620
And it has two focal
points, one on this side,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.390
so that is one focal point.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.970
And then it has another focal
point, the exact same distance,

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:45.720
on the other side.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.670
This lens is symmetric.

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:49.850
So let's think about
what this lens will

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.940
do to the images of
different objects.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.580
So let me draw its
principal axis again.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.270
So both focal points lie
along that principal axis.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:06.757
Now let's stick an object out
here, beyond the focal length.

00:07:06.757 --> 00:07:08.590
So let's think about
what's going to happen.

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:10.965
So first, remember, we can
pick any point on this object.

00:07:10.965 --> 00:07:13.811
Light is being diffusely
reflected off of every point.

00:07:13.811 --> 00:07:15.310
I like to pick
points that are going

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.520
to do something that's
kind of predictable.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.699
So let's pick a point.

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:20.740
Well, let's take the tip.

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.390
And take a ray that does
something that's predictable.

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.622
So let's take a ray that is
parallel to the principal axis.

00:07:27.622 --> 00:07:29.080
I mean, I could
draw this two steps

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.990
so it gets refracted once.

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.406
And then it'll get
refracted again

00:07:31.406 --> 00:07:35.120
through the focal point on
the other side of the lens.

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:39.680
So then it gets refracted
through there, just like that.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.290
And then, I could
take another ray

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.690
from the tip of
that arrow that goes

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.820
through the focal
point on this side.

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.330
So it goes through the
focal point on this side.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.710
And so that is going to
get refracted like this,

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.434
and then get refracted again.

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:58.350
So it comes out on the
other side of the lens,

00:07:58.350 --> 00:07:59.800
going parallel.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.150
And hopefully this
makes sense to you,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.754
because it's kind
of a symmetric deal

00:08:05.754 --> 00:08:07.170
that we're dealing
with over here.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:09.620
Something coming in
parallel on the right side

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.970
will go through the focal point.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.803
Then something going
through the focal point

00:08:12.803 --> 00:08:14.750
will come out on the
other side parallel.

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:18.430
So whatever light is coming out
radially outward onto this side

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:22.400
and going through the lens
will converge at this point,

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.319
right over here, on the
other side of the lens.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:27.360
And so you could do even
light that goes straight

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:29.517
through the lens would
end up right over there.

00:08:29.517 --> 00:08:31.100
It actually won't
be refracted at all.

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.850
It'll just be able to go
straight through the lens.

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.780
And so the image
that gets formed

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.690
on the other side of the
lens will look like that.

00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:44.059
So in this example,
it looks like we

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:46.110
have an inverted real image.

00:08:50.255 --> 00:08:51.630
And once again,
it's a real image

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.260
because the light is actually
converging at that point.

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:57.210
You would actually be able
to put some type of a screen

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:00.082
and project the image there.

00:09:00.082 --> 00:09:01.540
In the next video,
we're just going

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.580
to practice this idea of
drawing these rays to figure out

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:09.260
what type of images we'll get,
depending where the object is,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:11.660
whether it's at the focal
point, beyond the focal point,

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:13.380
beyond two times
the focal point,

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.777
or within the focal point.

00:09:14.777 --> 00:09:16.360
And the best thing
there is we'll just

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:19.180
get a lot of practice doing
this, drawing these rays

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.723
and thinking about how
they'll get refracted.
