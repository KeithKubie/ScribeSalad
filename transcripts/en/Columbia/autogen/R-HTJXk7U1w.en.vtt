this current unipolar system that's my
first question

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
first question
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.649

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.370
did it become one um and this is another
question I have been thinking about for

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380
question I have been thinking about for
 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.990
question I have been thinking about for
a long time you can see it reflected in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
a long time you can see it reflected in
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.719
a long time you can see it reflected in
resurrecting Empire um but it is a

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729
resurrecting Empire um but it is a
 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399
resurrecting Empire um but it is a
question I've been thinking about since

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409
question I've been thinking about since
 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.620
question I've been thinking about since
I finished that book more than one

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630
I finished that book more than one
 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.240
I finished that book more than one
almost four years ago now three and a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250
almost four years ago now three and a
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.749
almost four years ago now three and a
half years ago my third question more of

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759
half years ago my third question more of
 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.940
half years ago my third question more of
a historical question is how does this

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950
a historical question is how does this
 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.419
a historical question is how does this
unipolar system different from the

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429
unipolar system different from the
 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:07.730
unipolar system different from the
bipolar system which characterized the

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740
bipolar system which characterized the
 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.750
bipolar system which characterized the
Cold War period and which differed

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
Cold War period and which differed
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.580
Cold War period and which differed
greatly obviously from the multipolar

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
greatly obviously from the multipolar
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.920
greatly obviously from the multipolar
system that preceded it in others before

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930
system that preceded it in others before
 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.710
system that preceded it in others before
World War two how does the system we

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720
World War two how does the system we
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240
World War two how does the system we
have today where the United States is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
have today where the United States is
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.270
have today where the United States is
clearly the dominant power

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280
clearly the dominant power
 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.740
clearly the dominant power
you know folder system how does it

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750
you know folder system how does it
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.540
you know folder system how does it
differ from the bipolar system the Cold

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550
differ from the bipolar system the Cold
 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.210
differ from the bipolar system the Cold
War I will suggest perhaps less than we

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220
War I will suggest perhaps less than we
 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.260
War I will suggest perhaps less than we
may think and finally where is this all

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270
may think and finally where is this all
 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.559
may think and finally where is this all
going one of the cheapest lines that I I

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569
going one of the cheapest lines that I I

in the present might we look at to
 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.100
in the present might we look at to
understand where we might be going so

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110
understand where we might be going so
 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.170
understand where we might be going so
let me start by talking about the

current international system what
 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.780
current international system what
precisely is that situation is it a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
precisely is that situation is it a
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.540
precisely is that situation is it a
situation of hegemony whatever that word

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550
situation of hegemony whatever that word
 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.660

and so I suggest you look very carefully

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:06.130
and so I suggest you look very carefully
 

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:09.930
and so I suggest you look very carefully
at it in the future thank you very much
