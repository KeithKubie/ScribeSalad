that was built through those personal
 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.870
that was built through those personal
relationships enabled the program to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
relationships enabled the program to
 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.910
relationships enabled the program to

the eventual bumps in the road then the
 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440
the eventual bumps in the road then the
crises that occurred and I think that is

crises that occurred and I think that is
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.749
crises that occurred and I think that is
a that is a really good lesson that we

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
a that is a really good lesson that we
 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.460
a that is a really good lesson that we
can apply we can take the lesson that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470
can apply we can take the lesson that
 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.690

the low-hanging fruit seek those things
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410

that we do agree on and use that to

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
that we do agree on and use that to
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.210
that we do agree on and use that to
build relationships and to build the

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
build relationships and to build the
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.490
build relationships and to build the
platform through which we can then start

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
platform through which we can then start
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.780
platform through which we can then start
to address the things that we don't

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
to address the things that we don't
