00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:01.522
- [Voiceover] We're gonna talk about

00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:05.190
the operational amplifier,
or op-amp for short,

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.332
and this is the workhorse
of all analog electronics.

00:00:09.332 --> 00:00:12.554
The operational amplifier,
it's a type of amplifier.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:14.554
An amplifier is anything

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.716
that you put an electronic signal in,

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:21.820
and you get out a larger
version of the signal.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.680
So this will be an amplifier
with some sort of gain,

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.750
and if I put a signal x in here,

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.128
usually a voltage or a current,

00:00:30.128 --> 00:00:34.350
then the signal that comes
out here is A times x,

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.888
and that's what we mean by amplification.

00:00:36.888 --> 00:00:39.476
And a signal, that I've shown here as x,

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:40.842
is anything that we're interested in,

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.917
it could be a voltage or a current,

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:44.518
and when we put it through an amplifier,

00:00:44.518 --> 00:00:46.156
we get a larger version of it.

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:50.067
So this is a really common
activity in electronic design.

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:51.325
Now, when we talk specifically about

00:00:51.325 --> 00:00:54.592
an operational amplifier,
the symbol for that,

00:00:54.592 --> 00:00:58.858
we use for an operational
amplifier, is a triangle.

00:00:58.858 --> 00:01:00.358
It has two inputs,

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:06.282
one is the plus input,
one is the minus input,

00:01:06.282 --> 00:01:08.601
and it has an output,

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.935
and it also has two power supplies to it.

00:01:10.935 --> 00:01:15.001
There's some sort of plus
voltage that goes into it,

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.584
and some sort of minus voltage.

00:01:19.068 --> 00:01:22.555
So this is the abstract
symbol for an op-amp.

00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:23.883
So when we say the word op-amp,

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:26.876
we have some specific properties in mind.

00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:29.376
One is op-amps have high gain.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.420
So in this case, the gain,
usually with a symbol A,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.587
is something like 10 to the
fifth to 10 to the sixth.

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:44.116
Really, really high.

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:47.994
Another thing we think about
when we talk about op-amps

00:01:47.994 --> 00:01:51.577
is that they're used
for feedback circuits.

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.520
And we'll talk about feedback
in the next couple of videos

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.779
and what that means,

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:01.946
but that's the application
that we use op-amps for.

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:05.371
And the third that's
distinctive about op-amps

00:02:05.371 --> 00:02:07.912
is that they have this kind of input.

00:02:07.912 --> 00:02:09.349
This kind of input here is referred to

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:10.766
as a differential

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:16.322
input.

00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:22.941
So an op-amp usually
has differential inputs,

00:02:22.941 --> 00:02:25.186
and that's as opposed to something we call

00:02:25.186 --> 00:02:29.353
a single-ended input, which
will be just one wire.

00:02:31.045 --> 00:02:33.900
And what a differential input means,

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.155
it says, we have, we can
label the voltages here.

00:02:36.155 --> 00:02:39.860
We'll call this v out,
we'll call this v plus,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.448
and we'll call this input v minus.

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:45.698
And differential input means that v out

00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:48.391
equals the gain times

00:02:50.614 --> 00:02:52.364
v plus minus v minus.

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.996
So the output signal here is
proportional to the difference

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.833
in the voltage between
these two signals here.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.785
So I wanna make a plot of
this equation right here,

00:03:08.785 --> 00:03:12.868
just so we get a good idea
of what it looks like.

00:03:14.483 --> 00:03:17.566
And the axis here are v in and v out,

00:03:21.377 --> 00:03:25.544
where v in specifically
equals v plus minus v minus.

00:03:29.367 --> 00:03:31.852
v plus minus v minus,
that's the input signal

00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:34.971
to the op-amp, and we're gonna
apply the gain factor to it

00:03:34.971 --> 00:03:36.679
to get v out.

00:03:36.679 --> 00:03:38.975
So that'll look like
this, something like this,

00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:41.927
it's gonna be a very steep line,

00:03:41.927 --> 00:03:44.594
and the slope of that line,

00:03:44.594 --> 00:03:46.927
the slope of this line is A.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.789
So the slope is going
to be 10 to the fifth

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:51.249
or 10 to the sixth, something like that,

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.916
very, very vertical.

00:03:54.021 --> 00:03:56.508
Now one of the properties
of this is that v out

00:03:56.508 --> 00:04:01.396
cannot go above or below
its power supply voltages.

00:04:01.396 --> 00:04:04.347
So on this plot here,
that's called saturation.

00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:08.339
If v out gets up to V
plus, we say it saturates.

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.415
It looks like this, it
goes flat basically here

00:04:11.415 --> 00:04:15.120
and here, where this voltage value here

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.287
is minus the power supply,

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:23.284
and this voltage right here
is the positive power supply.

00:04:23.284 --> 00:04:25.814
But over this range here,
over this range in here

00:04:25.814 --> 00:04:29.882
between those two points, is quite linear.

00:04:29.882 --> 00:04:32.419
It goes through zero,

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.838
and this is where we
use it most of the time.

00:04:36.838 --> 00:04:39.122
So now I wanna talk a
little bit more detail about

00:04:39.122 --> 00:04:42.091
what this symbol means
here and what's inside it,

00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:46.091
and how it's actually
connected up in a circuit.

00:04:58.066 --> 00:05:00.922
So we talked about the
voltage behavior of an op-amp.

00:05:00.922 --> 00:05:03.839
This is v plus, v minus, and v out.

00:05:06.242 --> 00:05:07.729
There's one thing more
that we need to know,

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.016
and that is the current,

00:05:09.016 --> 00:05:10.568
this current right here

00:05:10.568 --> 00:05:12.907
and this current right here,

00:05:12.907 --> 00:05:16.240
for an op-amp, an ideal op-amp, is zero,

00:05:17.122 --> 00:05:18.749
no current flows in here.

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:21.727
So this op-amp is just sensing
the voltages at these points

00:05:21.727 --> 00:05:23.727
but no current flows in.

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:27.763
So this is the second key
property of an op-amp.

00:05:27.763 --> 00:05:30.836
The first one is the voltage behavior,

00:05:30.836 --> 00:05:33.086
v out equals the gain times

00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:37.178
v plus minus v minus.

00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:42.928
Another way we can write this
is v out equals A times v in,

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:48.844
where v in, of course,
equals v plus minus v minus.

00:05:52.524 --> 00:05:55.695
So these are the two electrical properties

00:05:55.695 --> 00:05:58.090
that are gonna allow us
to analyze these circuits.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:02.027
Analyzing these circuits is
actually gonna be pretty simple.

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:04.156
So you're probably wondering,
what is inside here,

00:06:04.156 --> 00:06:06.051
what's going on inside here?

00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:07.448
So what's inside here is,

00:06:07.448 --> 00:06:12.074
somewhere between 20 and 50 or
so transistors and resistors,

00:06:12.074 --> 00:06:13.950
sometimes capacitors.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:16.816
These are really complex
designs, and for right now,

00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:18.814
if we just concentrate
on the two properties

00:06:18.814 --> 00:06:22.142
that we have here, we'll be
able to use these circuits

00:06:22.142 --> 00:06:25.512
even without understanding
exactly what's inside.

00:06:25.512 --> 00:06:27.743
Suffice to say it's a
differential amplifier

00:06:27.743 --> 00:06:29.002
with really high gain,

00:06:29.002 --> 00:06:30.158
and with just that knowledge,

00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:32.971
we can work out how these circuits work.

00:06:32.971 --> 00:06:35.853
So let me do a couple of more details on

00:06:35.853 --> 00:06:38.106
how this thing is actually hooked up.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:41.933
So we have a plus terminal
and a minus terminal.

00:06:41.933 --> 00:06:42.919
There's more terminals on this,

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:45.760
there's a power supply like this,

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.260
that's plus big V,

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:49.652
and there has to be a minus supply,

00:06:49.652 --> 00:06:53.133
typically a minus supply, minus V,

00:06:53.133 --> 00:06:54.558
and there'll be a ground pin,

00:06:54.558 --> 00:06:57.391
there'll be a ground node on here,

00:06:58.836 --> 00:07:00.006
like that.

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:02.506
And when this is used in a circuit,

00:07:02.506 --> 00:07:04.917
there'll be, over to the side,

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:07.261
there'll be two power supplies,

00:07:07.261 --> 00:07:08.762
and this will be 12 volts,

00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:12.286
12 volts is a real typical value,

00:07:12.286 --> 00:07:14.619
and there'll be another one,

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:20.085
and this is a plus 12
volts supply as well,

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.435
and they'll be connected together,

00:07:22.435 --> 00:07:24.432
and this node right between them

00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:26.618
will be the ground node,

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:28.636
that's the voltage reference,

00:07:28.636 --> 00:07:31.369
and these two guys will
be hooked up like that,

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:34.231
the two power supplies
will be hooked up this way.

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:38.398
So, with respect to ground,
this node is at minus 12 volts

00:07:39.413 --> 00:07:43.246
and this node from ground
is at plus 12 volts.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.446
And ground is right in the middle.

00:07:46.446 --> 00:07:50.450
And when we measure v
out, we'll measure it

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.200
with respect to this ground node.

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.442
So this is the voltage where we measure

00:07:59.442 --> 00:08:02.109
plus or minus v out right there.

00:08:03.056 --> 00:08:04.627
And what we're gonna do
is we're gonna assume

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:06.846
that all of this stuff
is always hooked up,

00:08:06.846 --> 00:08:10.846
and we're just gonna use
an even simpler symbol,

00:08:11.853 --> 00:08:15.255
just the three terminals like that,

00:08:15.255 --> 00:08:17.277
and you'll know that all of
the rest of the power supply's

00:08:17.277 --> 00:08:19.059
hooked up that way.

00:08:19.059 --> 00:08:20.619
And the thing to keep in mind is

00:08:20.619 --> 00:08:22.461
there's a large minus voltage,

00:08:22.461 --> 00:08:24.134
there's a large plus voltage,

00:08:24.134 --> 00:08:26.692
and the ground level, the ground node,

00:08:26.692 --> 00:08:28.100
is right in between,

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.774
so positive voltage is high on the page,

00:08:30.774 --> 00:08:33.804
negative voltage is low on the page,

00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:38.085
and v out can go both positive
and negative around ground.

00:08:38.085 --> 00:08:42.252
So that's your voltage
framework to keep in your head.

00:08:45.186 --> 00:08:47.459
And the op-amp that we've been looking at

00:08:47.459 --> 00:08:49.376
has a symbol like this,

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.947
and we know that v out
equals some huge gain

00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:00.541
times v plus minus v minus,

00:09:02.434 --> 00:09:04.546
so this is a differential input,

00:09:04.546 --> 00:09:06.177
here's v plus,

00:09:06.177 --> 00:09:08.175
here's v minus.

00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:09.867
One way I think about this

00:09:09.867 --> 00:09:14.573
is to look at the way a
change in voltage on the input

00:09:14.573 --> 00:09:16.244
modifies the output.

00:09:16.244 --> 00:09:18.244
Let me label v out here.

00:09:23.167 --> 00:09:26.410
So, if there's a change on the input,

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:28.493
say v plus goes this way,

00:09:29.484 --> 00:09:31.039
because it's a plus sign,

00:09:31.039 --> 00:09:34.039
that means that v out goes this way.

00:09:35.348 --> 00:09:38.818
Now, if I change it over to v minus,

00:09:38.818 --> 00:09:41.588
v minus is on the negative input.

00:09:41.588 --> 00:09:43.171
If v minus goes up,

00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:46.408
then v out goes down,

00:09:47.332 --> 00:09:50.268
so that's the inverting, it's
called the inverting input,

00:09:50.268 --> 00:09:53.321
and this is called the
non-inverting input.

00:09:53.321 --> 00:09:56.654
So on a non-inverting input, up goes up,

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.048
and on the inverting input,

00:10:00.048 --> 00:10:02.243
if you go up on the inverting input,

00:10:02.243 --> 00:10:06.160
you go in the opposite
direction on the output.

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.678
Let's say that the positive
input, the non-inverting input,

00:10:11.678 --> 00:10:15.278
went down this time, and that means what?

00:10:15.278 --> 00:10:18.923
That means that v out will go down,

00:10:18.923 --> 00:10:21.340
and just do the same thing over here,

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.902
gonna run out of colors.

00:10:22.902 --> 00:10:25.755
Let's do the same thing
for the inverting input.

00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:30.564
If the inverting input goes
down, what does the output do?

00:10:30.564 --> 00:10:34.397
It goes up, it goes in
the opposite direction.

00:10:36.085 --> 00:10:37.394
That's the way to think about this symbol

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:39.479
when you see it on a schematic page,

00:10:39.479 --> 00:10:43.660
is how do these signals
translate through the device?

00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.517
Positive, non-inverting signals
go in the same direction,

00:10:47.517 --> 00:10:51.991
inverting signals go in
the opposite directions.

00:10:51.991 --> 00:10:54.389
Okay, and here's one final
trick I wanna share with you,

00:10:54.389 --> 00:10:56.993
something to be aware of.

00:10:56.993 --> 00:11:00.090
You're gonna see a symbol
like this on a page,

00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.877
the same op-amp.

00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:05.867
It's the same op-amp, but
it's written on the page

00:11:05.867 --> 00:11:09.051
with the negative, with the
inverting symbol on the top

00:11:09.051 --> 00:11:11.588
and the non-inverting
symbol on the bottom.

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:15.930
So, as you look at a schematic
that has an op-amp in it,

00:11:15.930 --> 00:11:18.446
one of the first things you
wanna do is just glance and see

00:11:18.446 --> 00:11:21.716
what order these symbols are in.

00:11:21.716 --> 00:11:22.931
Does it look like that

00:11:22.931 --> 00:11:24.293
or does it look like that?

00:11:24.293 --> 00:11:26.915
And keep that in mind as
you're reading the circuit

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:29.788
and trying to understand what it does.

00:11:29.788 --> 00:11:33.042
Okay, let's move on and build
something with our op-amp.
