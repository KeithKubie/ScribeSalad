00:00:00.006 --> 00:00:03.525
This first premultiplied texel would turn into this value. The 2.5 is clearly

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:08.212
out of range of a value that can be stored in a texel, in the range of 0 to 1.

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:12.696
So, this texel cannot be properly represented when unmultiplied. The second

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:17.402
texel would convert to values between 0 and 1. This is a valid unmultiplied

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:21.310
RGBA. To convert this third texel to unmultiplied form, the alpha value would

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.928
have to be used to divide the RGB values. Dividing a non 0 number by 0 is

00:00:25.928 --> 00:00:30.142
illegal. So, this premultiplied RGBA value cannot be converted and stored in

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:34.978
unmultiplied form. It's not a value that could've come from any and multiplied

00:00:34.978 --> 00:00:38.150
RBGA value because the alpha, which doesn't change in conversion, would

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.893
multiply any RBG value and so set it to 0. The last RGBA looks like it might be

00:00:42.893 --> 00:00:45.619
invalid to convert, since you would need to divide by 0 to convert from

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:50.860
premultiplied to unmultiplied form. However, this RGBA is entirely valid and is

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.910
the same as in premultiplied form. It represents an entirely transparent pixel.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.090
If you started with an unmultiplied RGB of any value and an alpha of 0, the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.504
premultiplied form would be the same. Note that the premultiplied form would

00:01:03.504 --> 00:01:06.640
loose the RGB that the unmultiplied form had in this case.
