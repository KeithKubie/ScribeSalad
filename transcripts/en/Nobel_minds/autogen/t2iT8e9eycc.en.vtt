Committee for that and then they told me

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480
Committee for that and then they told me
 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.369

really of course there are a few other
 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.630
really of course there are a few other
people who also contributed but I think

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640
people who also contributed but I think
 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.600
people who also contributed but I think
all of us know that the the Bell Prize

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610
all of us know that the the Bell Prize
 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.170
all of us know that the the Bell Prize
and awards are always usually only two

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
and awards are always usually only two
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.179
and awards are always usually only two
to three people so they're often one or

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
to three people so they're often one or
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.580

biomolecules with cryo-em what does it
allow you to see what detail can we now

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659
allow you to see what detail can we now
 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.850
allow you to see what detail can we now
see that we couldn't see before

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860
see that we couldn't see before

I think the first structures of
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.850
I think the first structures of
biological molecules were by x-ray

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860
biological molecules were by x-ray
 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.420

developing the x-ray method and since
 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.179
developing the x-ray method and since
we've had over the last 50 years

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:04.189
we've had over the last 50 years
 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.740
we've had over the last 50 years
hundreds of Oh at least a hundred

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
hundreds of Oh at least a hundred
 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.719
hundreds of Oh at least a hundred
thousand structures done by x-ray

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729
thousand structures done by x-ray
 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.110

is just an

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330
is just an
 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.140
is just an
other method of finding out what the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150
other method of finding out what the
 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.000

atomic structure high-resolution

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010

structure of your molecules are but the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
structure of your molecules are but the
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.740
structure of your molecules are but the
difference is that there are quite a lot

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750
difference is that there are quite a lot
 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.200
difference is that there are quite a lot
of structures and biology that were

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210
of structures and biology that were
 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.410
of structures and biology that were
resistant were recalcitrant to the other

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
resistant were recalcitrant to the other
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.970
resistant were recalcitrant to the other
methods like x-ray crystallography or

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980
methods like x-ray crystallography or
 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.010
methods like x-ray crystallography or
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.210
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
so it's opened up essentially a kind of

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220
so it's opened up essentially a kind of
 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.260
so it's opened up essentially a kind of
new previously unapproachable area of

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
new previously unapproachable area of
 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.140
new previously unapproachable area of
structural biology and I think my

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150
structural biology and I think my
 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.550
structural biology and I think my
original work was working on membrane

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560
original work was working on membrane
 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.290
original work was working on membrane
proteins which we found difficult to

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300
proteins which we found difficult to
 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.070
proteins which we found difficult to
crystallize the real power has come from

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
crystallize the real power has come from
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.320
crystallize the real power has come from
the images where you don't need crystals

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330
the images where you don't need crystals
 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.120
the images where you don't need crystals
so you just take a picture you look at

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130
so you just take a picture you look at
 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.920
so you just take a picture you look at
it you process it your average stretches

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930
it you process it your average stretches
 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.449
it you process it your average stretches
when you get there so it's a much more

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459
when you get there so it's a much more
 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.300
when you get there so it's a much more
direct method than making crystals

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310
direct method than making crystals
 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.860
direct method than making crystals
getting diffraction spots and then

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870
getting diffraction spots and then
 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.140
getting diffraction spots and then
figuring out what the diffraction spots

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150
figuring out what the diffraction spots
 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.000
figuring out what the diffraction spots
means so I think it's it's a direct

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
means so I think it's it's a direct
 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.150
means so I think it's it's a direct
method easy to understand and much more

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160
method easy to understand and much more
 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.790
method easy to understand and much more
general in its power and what you can

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800
general in its power and what you can
 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.250
general in its power and what you can
use it for thank you this is another

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
use it for thank you this is another
