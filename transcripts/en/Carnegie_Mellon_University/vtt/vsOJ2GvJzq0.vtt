00:00:08.466 --> 00:00:11.761
I grew up drawing my whole entire life,
figure drawing primarily,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:16.024
and I would say my junior year in college
is when I actually started painting more seriously.

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:19.769
I immediately shifted into
using unconventional materials.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.772
I started using objects
from my own childhood,

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.400
things with a certain
luster or polish to them.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.022
Thinking back on China cabinets and
these little beautiful encrusted plates,

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:35.541
creating that fiction of glamour,
of decadence, of wealth

00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:40.318
I think is something that's heavily
engrained into drag culture that always fascinates me,

00:00:40.318 --> 00:00:43.477
but it's also heavily engrained into black culture.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:46.796
Looking at even certain places
where I went to school growing up,

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:50.508
a lot of people felt the importance
of wearing gold chains,

00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:56.378
a ton of jewelry or young women
wearing bamboo gold hoop earrings

00:00:56.378 --> 00:00:58.642
with their names enscrawled in them.

00:00:58.654 --> 00:01:03.563
Those types of things to me all kind of conflate
into wanting or desiring

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:06.342
to appear much more than one

00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:09.696
maybe feels that they are or
deserve to be.

00:01:09.696 --> 00:01:15.867

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:21.289
Even as a child I would very rarely
go to the barbershop, actually.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.125
I never felt welcome in that space.

00:01:24.125 --> 00:01:27.712
I always felt like I was too effeminate,

00:01:27.712 --> 00:01:32.717
or I wasn't used to being around so
many hyper-masculine men.

00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:35.220
[MUSIC]

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.930
In painting myself in "Sit Still",

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.849
the largest painting that I
made in that entire series,

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.727
there's actually the barber's hands,

00:01:42.727 --> 00:01:46.433
who is always anonymous in
every one of those paintings,

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.442
those barber's hands
come in with a knife for

00:01:49.442 --> 00:01:51.736
shaving my neck,
my head is tilted upwards

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:57.117
and so that kind of tension of yes, this
fictional space might be beautiful and

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.994
welcoming, and exciting, and fun,
and playful and lighthearted,

00:01:59.994 --> 00:02:05.125
but it is, in reality, still unreasonable
to envision me entering that space and

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.127
feeling fully safe, even now.

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:09.170

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.257
&gt;&gt; The Warhol Museum is this,
how I see it, this perfect place for

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.717
Devan to have his first solo show.

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.847
It just connects to a history for
Devan, a history of painting,

00:02:18.847 --> 00:02:22.951
and Devan's work brings
Warhol's work to life.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:26.957
After a lot of conversations with Devan
about this body of work in Warhol's practice,

00:02:26.957 --> 00:02:33.153
Devan started this new body of
work around trans women and drag queens

00:02:33.153 --> 00:02:36.990
and specifically a drag queen
in Miami that he met, Miss Toto.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.620
So that painting will be situated within
Warhol's paintings from this series,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.539
from the Ladies Gentleman series.

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.292
[MUSIC]

00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:51.518
I think the most important thing for
me in this exhibition is that

00:02:51.518 --> 00:02:57.510
people leave with a new
image of what race can look like.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.348
He's working in a long history of
painters that have come before

00:03:02.348 --> 00:03:07.061
him that have brought light to
Black protagonists and painting

00:03:07.061 --> 00:03:10.537
into a canon that doesn't necessarily
have the Black protagonist

00:03:10.537 --> 00:03:12.859
as the main figure in painting.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.614
What Devan's doing now is
creating a space to also embrace

00:03:17.614 --> 00:03:19.866
an alternative perspective on that race.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.578
So, queering of that identity,
bringing in the feminine,

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:28.082
not actually positioning the masculine
always around Blackness,

00:03:28.082 --> 00:03:30.043
painting the flesh in different colors.

00:03:30.043 --> 00:03:32.083
There's a painting called "Butterfly Eater"

00:03:32.083 --> 00:03:35.256
in which the flesh of the
figure takes on the crimson sunset.

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:41.328
So, really challenging and complicating
our ideas around race and identity

00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:43.870
in a really productive way.

00:03:43.870 --> 00:04:03.428
