first thing I need to give my
application a name this is the name that

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:04.760
application a name this is the name that
 

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.389
application a name this is the name that
is going to appear to the users on the

00:22:07.389 --> 00:22:07.399
is going to appear to the users on the
 

00:22:07.399 --> 00:22:10.630
is going to appear to the users on the
app selector and then to say oral this

00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640
app selector and then to say oral this
 

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.600
app selector and then to say oral this
is the fake application name we've been

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:13.610
is the fake application name we've been
 

00:22:13.610 --> 00:22:16.510
is the fake application name we've been
using for the demos I'm going to rename

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:16.520
using for the demos I'm going to rename
 

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:19.779
using for the demos I'm going to rename
my module automotive to make it clear

00:22:19.779 --> 00:22:19.789
my module automotive to make it clear
 

00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:22.210
my module automotive to make it clear
that this is where all the automotive

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:22.220
that this is where all the automotive
 

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.519
that this is where all the automotive
specific things are going to go like all

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:24.529
specific things are going to go like all
 

00:22:24.529 --> 00:22:26.680
specific things are going to go like all
the vehicle optimized activities and

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:26.690
the vehicle optimized activities and
 

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:30.010
the vehicle optimized activities and
assets and I need to change my package

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:30.020
assets and I need to change my package
 

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.100
assets and I need to change my package
name to match the code that I already

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.110
name to match the code that I already
 

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.659
name to match the code that I already
have the wizard is going to ask me if I

00:22:37.659 --> 00:22:37.669
have the wizard is going to ask me if I
 

00:22:37.669 --> 00:22:39.970
have the wizard is going to ask me if I
want to create a new media service and

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:39.980
want to create a new media service and
 

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:42.399
want to create a new media service and
the truth is we already have one in the

00:22:42.399 --> 00:22:42.409
the truth is we already have one in the
 

00:22:42.409 --> 00:22:46.139
the truth is we already have one in the
share module so I'm going to say no and

00:22:46.139 --> 00:22:46.149
 

00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:48.700
now we just need to wait for Gradle to

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:48.710
now we just need to wait for Gradle to
 

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.399
now we just need to wait for Gradle to
do its thing and we get our third module

00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:51.409
do its thing and we get our third module
 

00:22:51.409 --> 00:22:54.909
do its thing and we get our third module
if we look a little deeper we can see

00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919
if we look a little deeper we can see
 

00:22:54.919 --> 00:22:58.090
if we look a little deeper we can see
that this manifest includes the

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.100
that this manifest includes the
 

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:00.039
that this manifest includes the
declarations to say that this is an

00:23:00.039 --> 00:23:00.049
declarations to say that this is an
 

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:04.570
declarations to say that this is an
automotive OS application but my module

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:04.580
automotive OS application but my module
 

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:06.880
automotive OS application but my module
is empty there's there is no code here

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:06.890
is empty there's there is no code here
 

00:23:06.890 --> 00:23:09.370
is empty there's there is no code here
and that's because we said we are going

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:09.380
and that's because we said we are going
 

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.370
and that's because we said we are going
to reuse the content of the media the

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:12.380
to reuse the content of the media the
 

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:15.190
to reuse the content of the media the
media module that we already have so for

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200
media module that we already have so for
 

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.190
media module that we already have so for
that I need to add a dependency I'm

00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200
that I need to add a dependency I'm
 

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:25.950
that I need to add a dependency I'm
going to add a line to this Gradle file

00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:25.960
 

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.710
and this is going to tell the automotive

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720
and this is going to tell the automotive
 

00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.320
and this is going to tell the automotive
module to reuse the media service that

00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:31.330
module to reuse the media service that
 

00:23:31.330 --> 00:23:34.380
module to reuse the media service that
we we have on the media module Maya

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.390
we we have on the media module Maya
 

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:37.320
we we have on the media module Maya
media module uses Java so I also need to

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:37.330
media module uses Java so I also need to
 

00:23:37.330 --> 00:23:41.990
media module uses Java so I also need to
copy this declaration over there and

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000
copy this declaration over there and
 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.820
copy this declaration over there and
that's it this is all the code I need to

00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:44.830
that's it this is all the code I need to
 

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:47.940
that's it this is all the code I need to
have an automotive OS application now in

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:47.950
have an automotive OS application now in
 

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.460
have an automotive OS application now in
order to test it I said before the best

00:23:50.460 --> 00:23:50.470
order to test it I said before the best
 

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.580
order to test it I said before the best
option is to use an emulator and this is

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:53.590
option is to use an emulator and this is
 

00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.130
option is to use an emulator and this is
where we added some new features to

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:56.140
where we added some new features to
 

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.580
where we added some new features to
undress to do we have a new section

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:58.590
undress to do we have a new section
 

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.620
undress to do we have a new section
automotive and here's where we have the

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:01.630
automotive and here's where we have the
 

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:04.440
automotive and here's where we have the
two new virtual devices so I'm going to

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:04.450
two new virtual devices so I'm going to
 

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:11.580
two new virtual devices so I'm going to
complete this wizard and we have a new

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:11.590
complete this wizard and we have a new
 

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:17.940
complete this wizard and we have a new
virtual device ready to launch so here

00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:17.950
virtual device ready to launch so here
 

00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:19.980
virtual device ready to launch so here
we have the emulator running well this

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:19.990
we have the emulator running well this
 

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:22.350
we have the emulator running well this
is booting I'm going to complete my my

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:22.360
is booting I'm going to complete my my
 

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:25.650
is booting I'm going to complete my my
code all I need to do is to compile it

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:25.660
code all I need to do is to compile it
 

00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.690
code all I need to do is to compile it
now you're going to notice there is this

00:24:27.690 --> 00:24:27.700
now you're going to notice there is this
 

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.280
now you're going to notice there is this
red cross here and that's because

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:31.290
red cross here and that's because
 

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:33.570
red cross here and that's because
Android studio is complaining that there

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:33.580
Android studio is complaining that there
 

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.450
Android studio is complaining that there
is no activity to launch and that's

00:24:36.450 --> 00:24:36.460
is no activity to launch and that's
 

00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.760
is no activity to launch and that's
actually by design because in our case

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:38.770
actually by design because in our case
 

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:41.250
actually by design because in our case
this application doesn't have a launcher

00:24:41.250 --> 00:24:41.260
this application doesn't have a launcher
 

00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:44.130
this application doesn't have a launcher
activity and the application is going to

00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:44.140
activity and the application is going to
 

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:47.040
activity and the application is going to
be launched by the media experience by

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:47.050
be launched by the media experience by
 

00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:49.110
be launched by the media experience by
the system so I'm going to select no

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:49.120
the system so I'm going to select no
 

00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:51.780
the system so I'm going to select no
nothing here so this is going to tell us

00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:51.790
nothing here so this is going to tell us
 

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:54.120
nothing here so this is going to tell us
to do to just compile and install it but

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:54.130
to do to just compile and install it but
 

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:59.760
to do to just compile and install it but
not to launch it and I want to show you

00:24:59.760 --> 00:24:59.770
not to launch it and I want to show you
 

00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:03.630
not to launch it and I want to show you
the media experience these are the

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640
the media experience these are the
 

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.520
the media experience these are the
applications we have by default and if I

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:07.530
applications we have by default and if I
 

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:15.030
applications we have by default and if I
if I compile we just need to wait a

00:25:15.030 --> 00:25:15.040
if I compile we just need to wait a
 

00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:17.810
if I compile we just need to wait a
couple of seconds

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:17.820
 

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:20.310
and this to you just told me that is

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:20.320
and this to you just told me that is
 

00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.260
and this to you just told me that is
compiled successfully and installed

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:22.270
compiled successfully and installed
 

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:24.780
compiled successfully and installed
successfully so now we have our new

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:24.790
successfully so now we have our new
 

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.440
successfully so now we have our new
application here if I click on it we

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:28.450
application here if I click on it we
 

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.270
application here if I click on it we
have an application working I can select

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:30.280
have an application working I can select
 

00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.330
have an application working I can select
a song this is going to start playing

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:32.340
a song this is going to start playing
 

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.670
a song this is going to start playing
and we have our application working on

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:35.680
and we have our application working on
 

00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.570
and we have our application working on
automotive OS

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:37.580
automotive OS
 

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.120
automotive OS
I want to show these same application

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:40.130
I want to show these same application
 

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:44.590
I want to show these same application
how it looks on the poster so I'm going

00:25:44.590 --> 00:25:44.600
how it looks on the poster so I'm going
 

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:50.710
how it looks on the poster so I'm going
to select the poster - and I'm going to

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:50.720
to select the poster - and I'm going to
 

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:57.070
to select the poster - and I'm going to
launch that that virtual device what is

00:25:57.070 --> 00:25:57.080
launch that that virtual device what is
 

00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:59.980
launch that that virtual device what is
what this is putting we can start

00:25:59.980 --> 00:25:59.990
what this is putting we can start
 

00:25:59.990 --> 00:26:10.090
what this is putting we can start
compiling again I need to wait

00:26:10.090 --> 00:26:10.100
 

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:17.000
okay

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:17.010
 

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:22.460
application is ready and we can see the

00:26:22.460 --> 00:26:22.470
application is ready and we can see the
 

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.250
application is ready and we can see the
same application how it looks at little

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:25.260
same application how it looks at little
 

00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:26.780
same application how it looks at little
different because this is using the

00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:26.790
different because this is using the
 

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.240
different because this is using the
customizations that Bo has done on their

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:29.250
customizations that Bo has done on their
 

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:36.680
customizations that Bo has done on their
own system okay and that's the demo can

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:36.690
own system okay and that's the demo can
 

00:26:36.690 --> 00:26:42.250
own system okay and that's the demo can
we switch back to the presentation

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:42.260
 

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:49.600
okay that way well thank you

00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:49.610
 

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.520
now with our code ready we are ready to

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:52.530
now with our code ready we are ready to
 

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.950
now with our code ready we are ready to
publish our application and for that

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960
publish our application and for that
 

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.140
publish our application and for that
what we're going to be using is using

00:26:57.140 --> 00:26:57.150
what we're going to be using is using
 

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.560
what we're going to be using is using
app bundles our bundles is a format that

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:00.570
app bundles our bundles is a format that
 

00:27:00.570 --> 00:27:02.990
app bundles our bundles is a format that
allows you to package all your assets
