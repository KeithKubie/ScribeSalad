[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.060
IDO GREEN: Hi, I'm Ido
Green, and Developer Advocate

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.680
for Actions on Google.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.020
Today, I want to show you
some very cool templates

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.960
that we created to make it
super easy for you to make

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.850
a new app without any code.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:16.750
I'll show you here.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.170
Let's dive in.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.170
When you open the Action
on Google console page,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.650
you will see all
the current option.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.580
Pretty nice, huh?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.120
What do you want to build today?

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.060
A trivia game?

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.250
Or maybe a flash card
game, to help a student

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.500
with their next physics exam?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.960
Let's go with helping people
learn something new, OK?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.686
The next step is to click on
the Flash Card Build button.

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.060
You'll come to
this screen, where

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.610
you can customize your app by
choosing a personality that

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.496
reflects how you want to sound.

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:46.870
Different
personalities will have

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.930
different ways of presenting
your prompt and response.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.970
Go ahead, click the
Play button to hear

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.500
examples of those prompts.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.826
And choose one that makes
the most sense for your app.

00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:58.700
REGAL QUEEN: Your
intelligence is staggering.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.850
[HARP MUSIC]

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.880
IDO GREEN: And we could
check Mr. Montgomery.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.979
[BEEP]

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.270
MR. MONTGOMERY: I like that
answer, because it's right.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.330
[PERCUSSION MUSIC]

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.360
Pencils down.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.400
The game is over.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.400
And now, for your score.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.920
[BEEPING]

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.250
IDO GREEN: So choose
the one, and click Next.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.960
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.450
In this part, we'll
add questions, answers,

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.100
and hints for the game.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.140
And we'll use a
Google Sheet for that.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.040
Easy, no?

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.646
Click on the Google
Sheet dialog.

00:01:28.646 --> 00:01:30.520
And you will see this
dialogue with an option

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.220
to click and make a copy.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.180
Click on the link.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.240
And then you'll get a new
browser tab with this option.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.520
Click on the Make a Copy button.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.322
And you'll get your
very own Google sheet.

00:01:43.322 --> 00:01:45.030
Remember there are a
few important things

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.490
to be careful of.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.890
Make sure to change all the
content on those two sheets

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.390
we provided here.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.620
We'll create a new questions and
answer based on your own topic.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.420
Please note, if
something is wrong,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.910
you'll get a
warning on the cell.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.730
No biggie, you can fix that.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.190
Once the question and
answer is completed,

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.860
click on the Configuration
tab, and make

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.130
sure you change the values of
each cell to fit your new app.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.260
After that, you're done here.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500
Copy the URL at the top.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460
Now you should paste this URL
into the previous screen, where

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.400
there is a field for your URL.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.575
And this is the dialog
after we copy the URL

00:02:26.575 --> 00:02:28.420
to our Google sheet.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.740
That was the build part.

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.560
Cool, huh?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.320
Click on the Create App in
order to close this wizard.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.220
Now, let's take a quick
coffee break, have a drink,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.070
and test our app
for the assistant.

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.060
Cool?

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.110
Too test our app, we need to
click on the Test App button.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.200
The web simulator is a great
tool that let us test our work

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.520
and see how it's going to work
on Google Home and phones.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.619
It's important to use our
app for the assistant,

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.660
and see that everything
is working well before we

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.300
submit our app for a review.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.000
By the way, if you are
logged in into the assistant

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
with the same account on
your phone or Google Home,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.940
you can test your
creation there as well.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.340
As you could see, you
could talk or type

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.770
and test your flash card game.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.280
That was it.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.100
You now know how to
use templates and make

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.940
new app without any code.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.490
Check out the
YouTube description

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.700

other documentation

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.560
in our blog post about
Actions Template.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.550
Until next time, be strong
and create amazing apps.
