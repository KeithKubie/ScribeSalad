00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.830
AL DYKSTRA: Oh, my gosh.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.290
NARRATOR: Near the site where
Lieutenant Colonel Benjamin

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:07.670
Pritchard and a group
of Union soldiers

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.670
arrested Confederate President
Jefferson Davis in 1865,

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.210
Al Dykstra and metal
detection expert

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.710
Gary Drayton have
just made what could

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.210
be an important discovery.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.420
GARY DRAYTON: Yep.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.880
Now we're talking,
Civil War find.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.040
AL DYKSTRA: That is.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.080
BRAD RICHARD: Find something?

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:25.880
GARY DRAYTON: Yep.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.080
Bit of Civil War.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.420
BRAD RICHARD: No way.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.750
KEVIN DYKSTRA: What
did you guys find?

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.750
Oh, I don't know if
I'm ready for this.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.250
Probably part of, like, a
canister shot or a slug shot--

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.420
KEVIN DYKSTRA: Oh,
yeah, shrapnel.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.420
Yeah.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.830
KEVIN DYKSTRA: Wow.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.540
GARY DRAYTON: Normally,
when you find these

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.540
and it was part of,
like, a larger shot--

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.210
Like artillery?

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.580
GARY DRAYTON: Yeah, normally
you can see where it was all

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.670
packed against each
other and you'll see,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.380
like, little slopes on them.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.580
It's got a flat side on it.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.750
GARY DRAYTON: Yeah.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.750
If it's got flat
on it, that means

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.880
it was part of a larger shot.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.830
KEVIN DYKSTRA: Wow.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.170
BRAD RICHARD: Nice work.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.170
So I wouldn't be
surprised to find a lot

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.880
more of these in this area.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.040
BRAD RICHARD: I think there was
a lot of soldiers on both sides

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.920
that really wanted
that gold, and I

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.620
think what we're
seeing is evidence

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.620
of how badly they wanted it.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.790
NARRATOR: Just before dawn on
May 10, 1865, as a detachment

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.620
of the 4th Michigan Cavalry
began their approach

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.880
to Jefferson Davis's
campsite from the southeast,

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.040
another Union detachment from
the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.080
was also advancing
from the north.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.880
A firefight ensued.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.290
And two members of the
4th Michigan Cavalry

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.960
were killed before the
regiment ultimately made

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.580
the arrest of Jefferson Davis.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.500
But although the
incident was later

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.080
recorded as an unfortunate
case of friendly fire,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.170
there are those who believe that
Benjamin Pritchard had ordered

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.330
his men to shoot anyone who
tried to thwart his efforts

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.290
to capture Davis, and with him,
seize the Confederate Treasury,

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.120
even if it meant
firing on Union troops.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.460
Have Kevin Dykstra and his
team just found evidence

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.420
that the so-called
friendly fire incident also

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.460
involved heavy artillery,
suggesting that Pritchard would

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.580
stop at nothing
in order to arrest

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.420
Davis and capture a fortune in
Confederate gold and silver?

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.330
[beeping]

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.460
GARY DRAYTON: See
how nice that sounds?

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.540
Let the big fella in
there and dig it up.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.790
Can I take this one?

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:39.380
Yeah, of course.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.710
[beeping]

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.330
GARY DRAYTON: It's a coin.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.670
And it's an oldie.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.710
BRAD RICHARD: From
the Civil War?

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.500
GARY DRAYTON: Oh, yeah.

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.330
You can see the stars going all
the way around the edges of it.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.250
That is a silver
Confederate coin.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.080
[laughter]

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.670
Woo!

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.920
Wow.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.920
NARRATOR: A silver
Confederate coin?

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.040
Could Kevin Dykstra and his
team have actually found

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.880
physical evidence that a fortune
in stolen Confederate gold

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.710
and silver was buried
here and then retrieved

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.420
more than 150 years ago?

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.420
To come out here and find
a Confederate coin where we

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.250
think that those wagons were--

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.080
Your research is proving true.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.540
Those wagons were carrying
60 kegs of silver coins.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.040
When they dumped them in the
ground, they got most of them

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.750
when they dug them back up,
but we found one they missed.

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.960
NARRATOR: For Kevin Dykstra,
finding physical evidence

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.710
that supports his theory that
millions in Confederate gold

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.040
made its way from a
burial pit in Georgia

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.290
to a boxcar that lies somewhere
at the bottom of Lake Michigan

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.380
has given him and his team
renewed confidence that they

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.210
are on the right path.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:12.790
But a crucial question remains.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.250
How did six wagon loads of
gold, silver, and jewels

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.460
travel all the way to
Michigan without detection?
