all together into a single view then you

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:25.340
all together into a single view then you
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.650

where you draw the line between control
 

00:22:46.249 --> 00:22:49.930
where you draw the line between control
and just basically where do you draw the

and just basically where do you draw the
 

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:52.299

know it's a delve into source code and

00:24:55.230 --> 00:24:55.240
know it's a delve into source code and

packages because I'm looking at the

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:09.350
packages because I'm looking at the
 

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:14.799
packages because I'm looking at the
Android designed for this fuse and they

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:14.809
Android designed for this fuse and they
 

00:25:14.809 --> 00:25:17.320
Android designed for this fuse and they
specifically say they use proper headers

00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:17.330
specifically say they use proper headers
 

00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:19.960
specifically say they use proper headers
and the heavens so answer design but

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:19.970
and the heavens so answer design but

trying to implement it for hollow is

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:21.890
trying to implement it for hollow is
 

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.240
trying to implement it for hollow is
really really difficult and the actual

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.250
really really difficult and the actual
 

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.370
really really difficult and the actual
calls and mucking around the source code

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:27.380
calls and mucking around the source code
 

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.169
calls and mucking around the source code
it's quite difficult when you're trying

00:25:29.169 --> 00:25:29.179
it's quite difficult when you're trying
 

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:35.020
it's quite difficult when you're trying
to scroll up and down the list yeah that

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:35.030
to scroll up and down the list yeah that
 

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:36.850
to scroll up and down the list yeah that
is a good idea so have you looked at the

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:36.860
is a good idea so have you looked at the
 

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:41.049
is a good idea so have you looked at the
contacts application so contacts this

00:25:41.049 --> 00:25:41.059

the cursor adapter and I'm trying to use
it just based on a simple array adapter

00:25:54.909 --> 00:25:54.919
it just based on a simple array adapter
 

00:25:54.919 --> 00:25:57.130
it just based on a simple array adapter
but you know I spent quite a while

00:25:57.130 --> 00:25:57.140
but you know I spent quite a while
 

00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:58.720
but you know I spent quite a while
trying to adapt it and I was like nah

happy that's the main thing so yeah I

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:46.020
happy that's the main thing so yeah I

the background for holo white as in the

00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:56.190
the background for holo white as in the
 

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:59.299
the background for holo white as in the
emulator or is it a gradient as in the

00:32:59.299 --> 00:32:59.309
emulator or is it a gradient as in the
 

00:32:59.309 --> 00:33:00.740
emulator or is it a gradient as in the

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:05.860
 

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:23.070
under default think the thief oh is it

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080
 

00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:28.330
do Nixon spark everything to lost you

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:28.340
do Nixon spark everything to lost you
 

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:36.640
do Nixon spark everything to lost you
guys yeah yeah so I I think the I think

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:36.650
guys yeah yeah so I I think the I think
 

00:33:36.650 --> 00:33:38.110
guys yeah yeah so I I think the I think
the default backbone is just a solid

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120
the default backbone is just a solid
 

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.970

color isn't it it's it's either dark or

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:39.980
color isn't it it's it's either dark or
 

00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.770
color isn't it it's it's either dark or
light depending on whether you use holo

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:41.780
light depending on whether you use holo
 

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.620
light depending on whether you use holo
light or holo dark yeah that's what I

00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:44.630
light or holo dark yeah that's what I
 

00:33:44.630 --> 00:33:46.720
light or holo dark yeah that's what I
thought the emulator seems to be either

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:46.730
thought the emulator seems to be either
 

00:33:46.730 --> 00:33:48.760
thought the emulator seems to be either
just white or black but on some devices

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:48.770
just white or black but on some devices
 

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.740
just white or black but on some devices
there is a gradient or something like

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:50.750
there is a gradient or something like
 

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.500
there is a gradient or something like
that so I'm kind of puzzled what's that

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:53.510
that so I'm kind of puzzled what's that
 

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:55.840
that so I'm kind of puzzled what's that
why is it not the same from the emulator

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:55.850
why is it not the same from the emulator
 

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:59.650
why is it not the same from the emulator
through device well this shouldn't be

00:33:59.650 --> 00:33:59.660
through device well this shouldn't be
 

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:03.190
through device well this shouldn't be

hollow element so when I tested it out

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:16.740
hollow element so when I tested it out
 

00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:17.990
hollow element so when I tested it out
on the area that I was like sweet this

00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000
on the area that I was like sweet this

worked you know it looks great and I put

00:36:19.549 --> 00:36:19.559
worked you know it looks great and I put
 

00:36:19.559 --> 00:36:21.289
worked you know it looks great and I put
it on the phone I was like oh what's

00:36:21.289 --> 00:36:21.299
it on the phone I was like oh what's
 

00:36:21.299 --> 00:36:24.259
it on the phone I was like oh what's
going on here the gradient so that's the

00:36:24.259 --> 00:36:24.269
going on here the gradient so that's the
 

00:36:24.269 --> 00:36:26.740
going on here the gradient so that's the
main problem and I try doing the

00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:26.750
main problem and I try doing the
 

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:29.029
main problem and I try doing the

00:36:29.029 --> 00:36:29.039
transparent backgrounds for the pin
 

00:36:29.039 --> 00:36:31.009

headers but then if you have a listview

00:36:31.009 --> 00:36:31.019
headers but then if you have a listview
 

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:33.440
headers but then if you have a listview
behind those hitters then you start

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:33.450
behind those hitters then you start
 

00:36:33.450 --> 00:36:34.880
behind those hitters then you start
seeing the text behind the other text

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:34.890
seeing the text behind the other text
 

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.599
seeing the text behind the other text
and it just gets very confusing did you

and it just gets very confusing did you
 

00:36:38.609 --> 00:36:41.029
and it just gets very confusing did you
set background color on the list view

00:36:41.029 --> 00:36:41.039

shouldn't the service run its own thread

shouldn't the service run its own thread
 

00:51:08.599 --> 00:51:10.689
shouldn't the service run its own thread
and I think the answer to that is yes

00:51:10.689 --> 00:51:10.699
and I think the answer to that is yes
 

00:51:10.699 --> 00:51:13.059
and I think the answer to that is yes
the service should still spin off its

also to say that a very convenient way

00:51:22.599 --> 00:51:22.609
also to say that a very convenient way
 

00:51:22.609 --> 00:51:24.939
also to say that a very convenient way
to make a service run and its own thread

00:51:24.939 --> 00:51:24.949
to make a service run and its own thread
 

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:28.179
to make a service run and its own thread
is to to create an intent service which

00:51:28.179 --> 00:51:28.189
is to to create an intent service which

is to to create an intent service which
does that automatically it's a newer

does that automatically it's a newer
 

00:51:30.319 --> 00:51:32.019
does that automatically it's a newer
form of service and it's very convenient

00:51:32.019 --> 00:51:32.029
form of service and it's very convenient
 

00:51:32.029 --> 00:51:33.759
