Since we know that Grant wants his profit to be at least $20,000 and p stands

00:00:05.096 --> 00:00:10.482
for profit in dollars. We know that p has to be greater than or equal to 20,000.

00:00:10.482 --> 00:00:15.031
Now we just have a simple case of substitution, p is equal to this entire

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:20.575
quantity, 75m minus 5,000. So you replace p here in the inequality with that

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:27.032
quantity. So here is our final answer. 75m minus 5,000 is greater than or equal

00:00:27.032 --> 00:00:27.943
to 20,000.
