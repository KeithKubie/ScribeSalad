presenter: I wanted to welcome
everyone to this event.

00:00:05.797 --> 00:00:09.397
I actually worked at Warner Music Group

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:12.564
and Eric was one of the artists that
was signed with Warner Brother Records

00:00:12.564 --> 00:00:14.564
which was one of our business units,

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:18.031
and I had the pleasure of hearing him
play about two and a half years ago,

00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:21.431
and it was probably the most
memorable event of my life

00:00:21.431 --> 00:00:23.097
when it comes to music.

00:00:23.097 --> 00:00:26.697
And I'm super excited to have him
come here and perform for you all.

00:00:26.697 --> 00:00:29.764
His album was released
in August of 2007

00:00:29.764 --> 00:00:34.031
and one of his best friends actually
ended up emailing Perez Hilton

00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:38.697
who posted Eric's MySpace page
on his site

00:00:38.697 --> 00:00:40.531
and then it was a success overnight.

00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:42.964
So we're super, super excited
to have him here

00:00:42.964 --> 00:00:45.231
and I hope you guys enjoy the show.

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:46.364
Thanks.

temperature instead of cold --

00:32:03.731 --> 00:32:06.631

So I have one more song here

00:32:25.497 --> 00:32:29.497
and then I guess we're maybe
doing a Q &amp; A

00:32:29.497 --> 00:32:32.964
which is shorthand in the music
industry for question and answer.

00:32:35.864 --> 00:32:37.564
So if you think you
might have a question

00:32:37.564 --> 00:32:40.131
this might be the time to start
thinking about what that might be

00:32:40.131 --> 00:32:43.897
because you know oftentimes
I've seen Q &amp; A's before

00:32:43.897 --> 00:32:45.797
and I've watched some of the ones
that have been happening here

00:32:45.797 --> 00:32:48.964
and it's usually that awkward
like five minutes

00:32:48.964 --> 00:32:51.597
where people are just flabbergasted
by asking questions.

00:32:51.597 --> 00:32:56.697
So I know I've been giving a lot of
constructive criticism today but --

00:32:56.697 --> 00:33:00.497
it's just more of a suggestion.

00:33:00.497 --> 00:33:04.797
If you wanna think of some
questions I totally give you a,

00:33:04.797 --> 00:33:09.464
I give you the right to totally
blank out during this last song.

00:36:36.364 --> 00:36:40.431
male #3: First off I think I hate you
for your obvious facility

00:36:40.431 --> 00:36:41.731
with music and lyrics.

00:36:41.731 --> 00:36:42.497
So thank you.

00:36:42.497 --> 00:36:43.697
Eric Hutchinson: You guys
are intense here at Google.

00:36:43.697 --> 00:36:44.664
[laughter] Is this
how everything starts?

00:36:44.664 --> 00:36:45.931
Is this how everything starts?

00:36:45.931 --> 00:36:47.131
male #3: No.

00:36:47.131 --> 00:36:47.631
Eric Hutchinson: Okay.

00:36:47.631 --> 00:36:48.897
male #3: But thank you
very much for the show,

00:36:48.897 --> 00:36:50.431
it was a lot of fun.

00:36:50.431 --> 00:36:51.597
Eric Hutchinson: I can't tell if people
are comin' to the microphone

00:36:51.597 --> 00:36:52.364
or leaving they're al--

00:36:52.364 --> 00:36:53.397
male #3: Sorry.
[laughter]

00:36:53.397 --> 00:36:54.797
Eric Hutchinson: Everyone's doin'
that I'm tryin'-- [laughter]

00:36:54.797 --> 00:36:56.197
male #3: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:56.197 --> 00:36:58.264
We have too many meetings
around here that's the problem.

00:36:58.264 --> 00:37:01.697
So when I grew up I bought CDs
and albums

00:37:01.697 --> 00:37:03.797
and I discovered music
at the record store

00:37:03.797 --> 00:37:07.131
and now obviously with your music
I discovered it on iTunes.

00:37:07.131 --> 00:37:13.064
So how do you feel about how people
are sort of stumbling upon your music

00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:16.797
and not having something physical
in their hand for the most part?

00:37:16.797 --> 00:37:20.031
Do you think that affects the way
we like hear your music

00:37:20.031 --> 00:37:22.231
and interpret what you've given?

00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:24.297
Eric Hutchinson: Yeah,

00:37:24.297 --> 00:37:25.897
 I think,

00:37:25.897 --> 00:37:26.797
well I have two feelings on it:

00:37:26.797 --> 00:37:28.897
I think iTunes has been absolutely,

00:37:28.897 --> 00:37:31.731
I mean the Internet in general
everything's been amazing for finding out,

00:37:31.731 --> 00:37:34.064
I mean I hear more music
than I ever heard before

00:37:34.064 --> 00:37:35.897
and I think a lot of people
are that same way.

00:37:35.897 --> 00:37:39.164
The only thing that I really miss
and I still actually have CDs

00:37:39.164 --> 00:37:41.797
and some people are better
with LPs or records of whatever,

00:37:41.797 --> 00:37:44.064
but I dismissed,

00:37:44.064 --> 00:37:46.864
we're seeing the end of the album
sort of where people,

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:49.731
even when you buy an album you usually
put it on shuffle or whatever or,

00:37:49.731 --> 00:37:53.197
it's thrown into your sort of
world of music that you have

00:37:53.197 --> 00:37:54.431
and I do the same thing a lot of times.

00:37:54.431 --> 00:37:59.064
But I think where you separate
the men from the boys with artists

00:37:59.064 --> 00:38:01.997
is who can make a full album
of material not just one song,

00:38:01.997 --> 00:38:05.297
who can do a full album's
worth of interesting,

00:38:05.297 --> 00:38:06.297
who can keep my attention,

00:38:06.297 --> 00:38:09.697
these days if you can keep
my attention for 45 minutes

00:38:09.697 --> 00:38:10.864
that's pretty impressive to me.

00:38:10.864 --> 00:38:13.364
So I just think we're missing,

00:38:13.364 --> 00:38:15.031
and it doesn't matter anymore people,

00:38:15.031 --> 00:38:16.931
I have friends with kids

00:38:16.931 --> 00:38:19.497
that will never, ever miss
having a CD or anything

00:38:19.497 --> 00:38:20.931
'cause they don't even understand
what that means.

00:38:20.931 --> 00:38:24.097
Now it's just all about I get music

00:38:24.097 --> 00:38:26.297
and then I put it onto this thing
and I listen to it

00:38:26.297 --> 00:38:28.564
whenever I feel like it.

00:38:28.564 --> 00:38:29.764
So -- 

00:38:30.431 --> 00:38:32.197
male #4: I'm of the previous generation.

00:38:32.197 --> 00:38:35.464
I was actually just goin' through
my old 45s recently,

00:38:35.464 --> 00:38:40.831
but I don't know much
of your background.

00:38:40.831 --> 00:38:42.764
A month or two ago
I was driving north on 101

00:38:42.764 --> 00:38:44.964
and I heard this awesome song
and I pulled out my phone

00:38:44.964 --> 00:38:47.764
and hit Shazam and said,
"Okay, "

00:38:47.764 --> 00:38:50.331
I bought Rock and Roll on iTunes

00:38:50.331 --> 00:38:52.864
and bam 30 seconds later there it was.

00:38:52.864 --> 00:38:56.331
Eric Hutchinson: Yeah,
I mean to me Shazam is,

00:38:56.331 --> 00:38:58.364
like that's the example
of what music is now

00:38:58.364 --> 00:39:00.964
where you hear something
and 20 seconds later you own it.

00:39:00.964 --> 00:39:02.864
I mean it's pretty amazing.

00:39:03.631 --> 00:39:07.764
male #4: So by way of background
at what point did you,

00:39:07.764 --> 00:39:10.097
so I don't know
whether this is your day job

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:12.731
or if there's something else that
you do when you're not saying,

00:39:12.731 --> 00:39:14.264
"Okay now I'm a musician,

00:39:14.264 --> 00:39:17.397
now I'm gonna put an album out
and be on the radio."

00:39:17.397 --> 00:39:18.331
Do you have a,

00:39:18.331 --> 00:39:21.397
is there a seamless blend there
or is this --

00:39:21.397 --> 00:39:24.097
Eric Hutchinson: Well this
is the day job as well.

00:39:24.097 --> 00:39:29.031
Tonight I work at In and Out --
[laughter] Burger.

00:39:29.031 --> 00:39:33.631
[laughs] Now yeah it's
full time and that's true.

00:39:33.631 --> 00:39:36.864
But for me lately I'm working
a lot from beats.

00:39:36.864 --> 00:39:38.497
I usually start with a beat

00:39:38.497 --> 00:39:41.431
and then kind of see what that
leads me to play on top of it

00:39:41.431 --> 00:39:44.931
and I usually will sort of sing words,

00:39:44.931 --> 00:39:46.131
whatever comes into my brain,

00:39:46.131 --> 00:39:49.364
and then I'll sort of get into a paper
and arrange it and see what --

00:39:49.364 --> 00:39:54.164
I'm kind of big into sort of letting
the subconscious sort of lead

00:39:54.164 --> 00:39:55.264
and sometimes you'll write a song

00:39:55.264 --> 00:39:57.531
and then a year later
I'll look back and be like,

00:39:57.531 --> 00:39:58.964
"Wow that's exactly
what's going on with me.

00:39:58.964 --> 00:40:02.231
I didn't even realize I was
writing a song about that."

00:40:03.231 --> 00:40:05.931
So for me it's definitely
melody first and then try,

00:40:05.931 --> 00:40:09.964
a lot of times I'm definitely on
the lookout always for things

00:40:09.964 --> 00:40:11.031
to write about,

00:40:11.031 --> 00:40:12.064
songs to,

00:40:12.064 --> 00:40:12.831
what I wanna say.

00:40:12.831 --> 00:40:16.197
Especially these days I mean I'll probably
have 10 songs on my album,

00:40:16.197 --> 00:40:18.764
 I wanna make sure each
song has something to say,

00:40:18.764 --> 00:40:20.431
what's the point
of listening to it?

00:40:23.231 --> 00:40:23.931
male #5: Hi.

00:40:23.931 --> 00:40:25.431
So when I told people
that you were coming

00:40:25.431 --> 00:40:27.997
my Dad told me that you also
grew up in Takoma Park

00:40:27.997 --> 00:40:29.064
and went to Montgomery Blair High School.

00:40:29.064 --> 00:40:31.164
Eric Hutchinson: Yes, I did.

00:40:31.164 --> 00:40:33.831
Not a ton of Blair people here
apparently but --

00:40:33.831 --> 00:40:34.497
male #5: Yeah, cool.

00:40:34.497 --> 00:40:35.564
Eric Hutchinson: Did you go to Blair?

00:40:35.564 --> 00:40:36.064
male #5: Yeah.

00:40:36.064 --> 00:40:36.897
Eric Hutchinson: Oh, great.

00:40:36.897 --> 00:40:38.897
What year did you graduate?

00:40:38.897 --> 00:40:40.597
male #5: 2003.
[chuckles]

00:40:40.597 --> 00:40:42.131
Eric Hutchinson: Okay, cool.

00:40:42.131 --> 00:40:44.497
male #5: Yeah I don't know if
you were in like cap back then.

00:40:44.497 --> 00:40:46.064
Eric Hutchinson: I was in the cap
for a while yeah.

00:40:46.064 --> 00:40:49.931
male #5: I was in the magnet.
Science magnet anyway.

00:40:49.931 --> 00:40:52.897
So I was just wondering like
I don't really think of

00:40:52.897 --> 00:40:57.164
there being that much of
like acoustic pop music scene

00:40:57.164 --> 00:40:58.797
I don't know in Takoma Park,

00:40:58.797 --> 00:40:59.831
Silver Spring area --

00:40:59.831 --> 00:41:02.764
but like did you develop
much as a musician then

00:41:02.764 --> 00:41:04.497
or is there a scene I wasn't aware of

00:41:04.497 --> 00:41:06.997
or was it more when you got to college -- [laughter]

00:41:06.997 --> 00:41:09.764
Eric Hutchinson: You were
never invited over to the -

00:41:09.764 --> 00:41:11.997
yeah, no I--

00:41:11.997 --> 00:41:12.931
 there wasn't necessarily.

00:41:12.931 --> 00:41:14.864
I didn't get involved with
hardly anything in high school

00:41:14.864 --> 00:41:16.331
which is one of my big regrets.

00:41:16.331 --> 00:41:19.197
I did almost nothing,
everything I did was on my own.

00:41:19.197 --> 00:41:22.464
I worked on music or I was
actually a film major in college

00:41:22.464 --> 00:41:24.664
so I made a lot of
short films stuff like that,

00:41:24.664 --> 00:41:27.897
 but I wouldn't say there
was a huge community no.

00:41:27.897 --> 00:41:31.464
I mean mainly my family just sort of
played music for me when I was young

00:41:31.464 --> 00:41:34.597
and I kinda just got into it and
then when I went to college

00:41:34.597 --> 00:41:36.431
started getting more into it.

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.731
Yeah I'm not really sure exactly
where it came from

00:41:41.731 --> 00:41:45.764
other than my parents bought one of
the first CD players that was available,

00:41:45.764 --> 00:41:47.497
they paid like $500 for it

00:41:47.497 --> 00:41:50.931
and all they had for a while
was the entire Beatles catalog,

00:41:50.931 --> 00:41:53.531
like literally it was like the 13 CDs
and that was all we had.

00:41:53.531 --> 00:41:58.531
So I remember there just being sort of
a high importance on music in the house.

00:41:58.531 --> 00:42:05.231
[applause]
00:42:05.367,00:00:00.000
