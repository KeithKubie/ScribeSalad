00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.337
She wrote it, she sent it, I'm*d

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:13.846
- Having an unsend is bad.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:17.216 align:start size:97% position:3%
But being on the receiving end
of an unsend is even worse.

00:00:17.216 --> 00:00:19.919 align:start size:84% position:16%
I went on a date with
this lovely lady.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.754
Let's call her Pam.

00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:23.689
It wasn't terribly great.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.290
I was just kind of
hoping that maybe

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.625
I just wouldn't hear from her.

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:28.962
Two days go by, I get a
text message from Pam.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:30.295
"Hey, I had a great time.

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:31.597
"What are you doing tonight?"

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:33.299
It was a Saturday by
the way and even if I

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:34.634
had a great time
I don't know if I

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:36.035
was ready to give
up my Saturday.

00:00:36.035 --> 00:00:38.071
At this point I don't
really know what to do.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.539
I don't want to be a dick.

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:42.375 align:start size:97% position:3%
And then Pam sends a text
message and it's really long.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:46.713
Nothing this long is ever
good in a text message.

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.715
I mean I feel like we
can all agree on that.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:49.949
- [Group] Yes!

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.650
I quickly realized it's
not addressed to me.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.586
It's addressed to
a friend of Pam's.

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:55.721 align:start size:88% position:13%
"So I've asked him what
he's doing tonight.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:56.623
"He's busy.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:00:58.091
"Oh by the way,

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.825 align:start size:97% position:3%
he just liked another girl's
picture on Instagram."

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:01.494
Which I thought was
a bit of a red flag.

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:02.728
Now I don't know what to do.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.764
But before I even get
a chance to decide

00:01:04.764 --> 00:01:06.332
I get another text from Pam.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:09.235
"OMG I can't believe
I sent that to you.

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.637
"I'm guessing you don't want
to go out with me anymore."

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:12.905
I didn't.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.807
So I panic and feel
really bad and reply,

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.008
"Oh, no big deal.

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:18.644
"I'll totally go
with you again."

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.146 line:0%
Pro tip.

00:01:20.146 --> 00:01:22.649
Sometimes ghosting is the
nicest thing you can do.
