00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.876
- [Voiceover] This right here is the graph

00:00:01.876 --> 00:00:05.021
of Y is equal to X to the third over six

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.191
plus one over two X.

00:00:07.191 --> 00:00:08.848
And what I want to do in this video is

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:11.388
to figure out the arc
length along this curve

00:00:11.388 --> 00:00:13.660
between X equals one and X equals two.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.683
And so we've already highlighted that

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:18.414
in this purple-ish color.

00:00:18.414 --> 00:00:20.149
So I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:21.269
and try it out on your own.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.698
And I'll give you one hint.

00:00:22.698 --> 00:00:25.797
Assuming that you apply
the arc length formula

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:29.297
correctly, it'll just be
a bit of power algebra

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:33.388
that you'll have to do to
actually find the arc length.

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.043
So I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:36.691
Let's work through it together.

00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:39.937
So a few videos ago,
we got a justification

00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:42.338
for the formula of arc length.

00:00:42.338 --> 00:00:46.488
We got arc length, arc length is equal to

00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:50.211
the integral from the
lower boundary in X to

00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:52.912
the upper boundary in X,
and this is the arc length,

00:00:52.912 --> 00:00:55.157
if we're dealing in terms
of X we could actually

00:00:55.157 --> 00:00:57.081
deal in terms of other variables.

00:00:57.081 --> 00:01:00.831
And so it's going to be
one plus F prime of X

00:01:02.422 --> 00:01:03.422
squared D X.

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:08.099
So for this particular F of
X we just need to figure out

00:01:08.099 --> 00:01:10.250
what F prime of X is, we
need to square it, we need to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.574
add one to it, and then we
have to take the square root

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:13.439
of that.

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.056
So let's do all of that step-by-step.

00:01:16.056 --> 00:01:19.056
So what is F prime of X going to be?

00:01:20.393 --> 00:01:22.524
Let's see, X to the third,
the derivative of that

00:01:22.524 --> 00:01:24.107
is three X squared.

00:01:25.058 --> 00:01:27.894
So three X squared, three
over six is going to be

00:01:27.894 --> 00:01:32.630
X squared over two, and
this is one half X to the

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.800
negative one is one way to think about it.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.550
And so that's going to
be negative one half X

00:01:39.468 --> 00:01:40.789
to the negative two.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.622
Negative one half X to
the negative two power.

00:01:48.832 --> 00:01:52.436
Now, what is F prime of X squared?

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:53.291
So it's going to be,

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:55.816
Actually let's just write
out what is one plus F prime

00:01:55.816 --> 00:01:57.339
of X squared?

00:01:57.339 --> 00:01:59.641
So it's going to be,

00:01:59.641 --> 00:02:02.141
So one, one plus F prime of X,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.367
F prime of X squared

00:02:09.157 --> 00:02:10.532
is going to be equal to

00:02:10.532 --> 00:02:14.032
it's gonna be one plus this thing squared.

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:17.825
And so, let's see, this
term right here squared

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.765
is going to be X to the fourth over four.

00:02:20.765 --> 00:02:24.504
It's gonna be X to the fourth over four.

00:02:24.504 --> 00:02:28.439
Now the product of
these times two is going

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.022
to get us negative,

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:34.906
Let's see X squared time
X to the negative two

00:02:34.906 --> 00:02:36.929
which is going to be one.

00:02:36.929 --> 00:02:40.717
And so it's going to be negative one half.

00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:42.592
Right, I just took the
product of these two

00:02:42.592 --> 00:02:45.305
and then multiplied that by two, yep,

00:02:45.305 --> 00:02:47.356
it's just gonna be negative one half.

00:02:47.356 --> 00:02:49.190
And then this term right over here squared

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.463
is going to be positive one fourth X

00:02:52.463 --> 00:02:54.783
to the negative four.

00:02:54.783 --> 00:02:57.485
One fourth X to the negative four.

00:02:57.485 --> 00:02:59.789
Now let's see we have
one and a minus one half

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.214
so we can simplify them a little bit.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.685
This is going to be
equal to X to the fourth

00:03:04.685 --> 00:03:06.195
over four.

00:03:06.195 --> 00:03:10.362
One minus one half is plus
one half plus one fourth,

00:03:12.474 --> 00:03:16.224
plus one fourth X to
the negative four power.

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.836
Let me make that a little bit clearer.

00:03:19.836 --> 00:03:21.669
X to the negative four power.

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.775
So this seems a little bit strange.

00:03:23.775 --> 00:03:25.659
And we're going to have to
take the square root of it.

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:28.305
But maybe we can set this
up so that it's a product

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:30.480
of perfect squares, because it does look,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.113
you know X to fourth
and let's see if we can

00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:34.798
write this in a way
that we could recognize

00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:37.103
how to factor it a little bit better.

00:03:37.103 --> 00:03:38.480
So let's factor out a one fourth X

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.284
to the negative fourth power.

00:03:41.284 --> 00:03:42.871
So this is going to be equal to

00:03:42.871 --> 00:03:46.204
one fourth X to the negative four times,

00:03:50.006 --> 00:03:53.239
let's see I factored that out,

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.586
so if you factor one
fourth X to the negative

00:03:55.586 --> 00:03:57.493
fourth out of this first term, and I could

00:03:57.493 --> 00:03:58.388
color-code 'em a little bit.

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:00.156
This first term, when you factor this out

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.730
is going to be X to the eighth power.

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.904
Now this term right over
here, if I factored out

00:04:06.904 --> 00:04:10.154
a one fourth, it's going to be equal to

00:04:11.546 --> 00:04:13.213
two X to the fourth.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.576
So this term right over here,

00:04:17.576 --> 00:04:20.352
once again, this powering
through the algebra part.

00:04:20.352 --> 00:04:22.685
So plus two X to the fourth,

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.664
and then this one is
pretty straight forward.

00:04:25.664 --> 00:04:28.257
This is just going to be equal to one.

00:04:28.257 --> 00:04:29.257
So plus one.

00:04:31.056 --> 00:04:31.889
Plus one.

00:04:33.804 --> 00:04:36.432
And now this is looking interesting.

00:04:36.432 --> 00:04:39.332
Because this one, this right over here

00:04:39.332 --> 00:04:43.389
we could rewrite as one half
X to the negative two squared.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.227
This is equal to, that same color,

00:04:46.227 --> 00:04:49.477
one half X to the negative two squared.

00:04:51.966 --> 00:04:54.935
And this over here we
could rewrite this as X

00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:56.518
to the fourth plus,

00:04:58.046 --> 00:05:00.046
so we write it this way,

00:05:01.183 --> 00:05:04.302
this is going to be X to the fourth plus

00:05:04.302 --> 00:05:05.653
one squared.

00:05:05.653 --> 00:05:08.452
Alright, X to the fourth
times X to the fourth is

00:05:08.452 --> 00:05:09.292
X to the eighth.

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:10.532
One squared is one.

00:05:10.532 --> 00:05:13.401
The product of them times
two is two X to the fourth.

00:05:13.401 --> 00:05:16.082
So this over here is
the same thing as that.

00:05:16.082 --> 00:05:17.902
And so now if we wanted
to take the square root

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:19.622
of both sides.

00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:23.313
So if we wanted to say the
square root of one prime

00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:24.221
plus X squared.

00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:25.918
Notice I'm just focusing on the algebra.

00:05:25.918 --> 00:05:30.085
So what we've done so far
this is one plus F prime

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:32.321
of X squared.

00:05:33.958 --> 00:05:37.029
Now we want to take the
square root of that.

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.279
So that's going to be
the square root of this.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:42.809
And so that's going to be equal to

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.880
square root of this is,
let me just color code it,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.047
this is going to be one half
X to the negative two power

00:05:51.413 --> 00:05:54.580
times, times X to the fourth plus one.

00:05:56.061 --> 00:05:58.644
Times X to the fourth plus one.

00:06:00.871 --> 00:06:02.954
X to the fourth plus one.

00:06:04.562 --> 00:06:05.558
I did that right, yep.

00:06:05.558 --> 00:06:06.695
Or

00:06:06.695 --> 00:06:08.818
I could actually, now that I did all this

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:10.336
to put this in a form
that I could actually

00:06:10.336 --> 00:06:12.488
recognize, now I could
distribute things back.

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:16.088
This is going to be equal to one half,

00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:20.161
X to the negative two
times X to the fourth

00:06:20.161 --> 00:06:21.244
is X squared.

00:06:22.312 --> 00:06:26.479
One half X squared plus one
half X to the negative two.

00:06:29.343 --> 00:06:32.433
And if we're gonna take,
if we're gonna take,

00:06:32.433 --> 00:06:34.204
Let me rewrite this.

00:06:34.204 --> 00:06:37.287
That's one plus F prime of X squared.

00:06:39.866 --> 00:06:43.228
Now let's take the definite integral.

00:06:43.228 --> 00:06:46.568
I'm going to give myself
some space to write my D X.

00:06:46.568 --> 00:06:48.232
So we're gonna take the definite integral,

00:06:48.232 --> 00:06:51.282
in this case, from X equals one

00:06:51.282 --> 00:06:53.771
X equals one to X equals two.

00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:58.224
So this is the definite
integral from X equals one

00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:00.635
to X equals two of this D X.

00:07:00.635 --> 00:07:01.877
So it's going to be the
definite integral of this

00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:05.044
from X equals one to X equals two D X.

00:07:06.478 --> 00:07:09.189
And so this is fairly straight forward.

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:12.732
The anti-derivative of one half X squared

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.352
that's going to be, what?

00:07:14.352 --> 00:07:16.994
That's going to be one,
let's see it's X to the third

00:07:16.994 --> 00:07:18.335
and then we divide by three.

00:07:18.335 --> 00:07:20.398
So one half divided by three is one sixth.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:22.481
One sixth X to the third.

00:07:24.233 --> 00:07:25.779
And then this is going to be,

00:07:25.779 --> 00:07:26.870
we're going to increment,

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.200
this is gonna be X to the negative one.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.484
We're gonna divide by
that so minus one half X

00:07:31.484 --> 00:07:33.514
to the negative one power.

00:07:33.514 --> 00:07:34.347
Is that right?

00:07:34.347 --> 00:07:35.180
Did I do that?

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.059
Yep, negative one, when you
take it, yep negative two

00:07:37.059 --> 00:07:39.500
and then this one, yep, that looks good.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.748
And we're in the homestretch.

00:07:40.748 --> 00:07:42.109
We're gonna evaluate it.

00:07:42.109 --> 00:07:43.609
At two and at one.

00:07:45.173 --> 00:07:46.022
And so we get,

00:07:46.022 --> 00:07:47.627
when you evaluate it at two, you get

00:07:47.627 --> 00:07:51.117
two to the third, which is eight over six

00:07:51.117 --> 00:07:53.617
minus one half times one half.

00:07:56.021 --> 00:07:58.362
So this is minus one fourth.

00:07:58.362 --> 00:07:59.195
And when you evaluate it at one,

00:07:59.195 --> 00:08:02.354
you're gonna have minus
so we're gonna subtract

00:08:02.354 --> 00:08:04.016
evaluating it at one,

00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:07.208
it's gonna be one sixth minus one half)

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:09.610
And now we just have to
evaluate these fractions.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.312
So this is going to be, let's see

00:08:12.312 --> 00:08:15.234
This is, if we divide,
this is four thirds,

00:08:15.234 --> 00:08:18.901
four thirds minus one
fourth minus one sixth

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:23.883
and then we have plus plus one half.

00:08:25.013 --> 00:08:27.887
Now let's see the common
denominator here would be 12.

00:08:27.887 --> 00:08:30.107
So this is be four thirds over 12 is

00:08:30.107 --> 00:08:31.588
16 over 12.

00:08:31.588 --> 00:08:34.381
Alright multiply the numerator
and denominator by four.

00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:38.548
Minus one fourth, the same
thing as three over 12.

00:08:40.786 --> 00:08:43.286
Now this is minus two over 12.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:47.613
And then we have plus six over 12.

00:08:47.613 --> 00:08:49.754
And so this is going to be equal to,

00:08:49.754 --> 00:08:51.917
I think we deserve at least
a little mini-drum roll

00:08:51.917 --> 00:08:53.318
right over here.

00:08:53.318 --> 00:08:57.485
So 16 minus three is going
to be 13 minus two is 11

00:08:59.474 --> 00:09:00.724
plus six is 17.

00:09:03.748 --> 00:09:05.090
So there we have it.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:06.661
The length of that arc

00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:08.383
along this curve.

00:09:08.383 --> 00:09:10.906
Between X equals one and X equals two.

00:09:10.906 --> 00:09:15.710
