[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:07.650
SPEAKER 1: Hi.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.160
I'm [INAUDIBLE], and I'm part
of the Google Talk Scene,

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.510
and I'm also a
developer at Google.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.510
So today, we're going to discuss
Scott and Carolyn's book,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.210
"Wired to Create."

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.250
Scott is the Scientific Director
of the Imagination Institute

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.600
in the Positive Psychology
Center at the University

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.290
of Pennsylvania.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.200
He conducts research on
the measurement and element

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.680
of imagination,
creativity, and play,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.540
and teaches the popular
undergrad course,

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.250
which is Introduction
to Positive Psychology.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.730
And he's also host of
The Psychology Podcast

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.960
and co-founder of
the Creative Post,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.790
and he writes blog
"Beautiful Minds"

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.800
in "Scientific American."

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.580
Carolyn is New York-based
journalist and author.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.420
She's currently a Senior
Writer at the Huffington Post,

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.400
and she reports on
health and science.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.990
Her writing has also appeared
in "Scientific American,"

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.430
CNN, and other publications.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.420
And she's discussed her
work on MSNBC, "Today Show,"

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.160
and the History Channel.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.190
So please welcome
Scott and Carolyn.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.375
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.060
So their book,
"Wired to Create,"

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.710
offers a glimpse
inside the messy minds

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.480
of highly creative people.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.740
So let's get started
with book introduction

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.419
from Scott and Carolyn.

00:01:28.419 --> 00:01:29.585
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Thank you.

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:30.240
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Hey, guys.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.740
Welcome.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.252
Can you hear me OK, all
the guys over back there?

00:01:34.252 --> 00:01:36.460
So yeah, we wrote this book
called "Wired to Create."

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.060
I am a scientist.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.440
I've been on this mission
for a very long time,

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.170
to understand what is the nature
of human intelligence, what is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.870
the nature of human creativity.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.120
How does it work in the brain?

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:48.700
How can we develop it in people?

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.700
How can we appreciate
it more in society?

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.470
There seems to be a bias
against creativity in schools

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.140
and in certain workplaces--
I assume not Google at all.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.520
You guys seem very progressive.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.026
I just went to the bathroom.

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:04.150
There was a woman right
next to me in the bathroom,

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.260
and that was OK.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.289
So it's a very
progressive place.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.411
It's a unisex bathroom.

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:10.910
So--

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.255
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.255 --> 00:02:16.720
--to explain that.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.430
And all these sorts
of questions of like,

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.920
what is creatively really?

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.123
How can we really
promote and stimulate it?

00:02:22.123 --> 00:02:24.810
Is it just a soft
skill, or is it

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.054
something that is deeper
and more important

00:02:27.054 --> 00:02:28.470
Do you want to
introduce yourself?

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.070
CAROLYN GREGOIRE:
So I'm Carolyn.

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:31.660
Scott and I co-wrote this book.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.460
And we were motivated
by all these questions

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.270
that Scott mentioned, but
primarily the question of what

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.310
makes highly creative people
different from everyone else.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.310
And so this kind of
exploration took us

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.030
through decades worth of
personality psychology,

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.040
starting with a really
interesting experiment

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.970
that was done in the '60s by a
researcher named Frank Barron.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.960
So he invited all
of these eminent

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.790
creative minds-- Truman Capote,
William Carlos Williams,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.580
Frank O'Connor-- to
stay in this frat house

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.212
on the UC-Berkeley campus.

00:03:05.212 --> 00:03:06.670
But they weren't
playing beer pong.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.540
They were doing much
more fun things,

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.100
like answering personality tests
and tests of mental illness,

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.190
and all kinds of different
examinations of the way

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.980
that they think and
feel and behave,

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.050
and questions about
their life circumstances.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.140
And what he found was a pretty
big insight at the time,

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.280
even though it may not
sound like it today,

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.319
that creativity and intelligence
are not the same thing.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.610
So that was kind of the
jumping off point of this book,

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.850
is if creativity is
not intelligence,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.520
then what is it, really?

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.220
And so we look to
explain the special spark

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.950
of creative genius.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.480
And at least in
that study, Barron

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.320
found a few central
characteristics, which

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.960
were these highly
creative people

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.790
were very open to
their own inner lives.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.880
They had a very high tolerance
for disorder, for complexity,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.970
for chaos, for ambiguity.

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.950
They had this desire to
make meaning out of chaos.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.140
They were non-conformist.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.170
They were unconventional,
risk-takers.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.810
They were kind of originals
and very individual.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.150
So he found that
this very messy mix

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.090
of things, which is
where we kind of got

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.215
this idea of-- well,
one of the places we

00:04:15.215 --> 00:04:17.839
got this idea of the messy minds
of the highly creative person,

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.000
that they can't be boiled
down to one single thing.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.190
It's this complex sort of
host of characteristics

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.522
that seem to inform creativity.

00:04:24.522 --> 00:04:25.730
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Totally.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.230
We want to rebrand having a
messy mind as a good thing.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.479
In schools, we promote
efficiency, right?

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.520
We say, OK, well you have
to do well on this test

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.744
and you can't revise it.

00:04:37.744 --> 00:04:39.660
You have to do well on
this standardized test.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.450
But when we study
these creative geniuses

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.370
or these great creators, you
see they're not characterized

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.719
by their efficiency.

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.510
They're characterized
by their variability.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.510
They're characterized by
their trial and error,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.080
their risk-taking, their
openness to experiences,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.250
their sensitivity.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.860
And a lot of times,
their sensitivity

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.360
can seemingly get in the way
of their creative process.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.950
But you find that it
is through reconciling

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.410
all of these contradictions
within themselves that you

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.182
find creativity is
most likely to emerge.

00:05:10.182 --> 00:05:11.640
We also found lots
of contradiction

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.275
with introversion
and extroversion.

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:14.900
Raise your hand if
you're an introvert.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.108
No, I'm not going to do that.

00:05:16.108 --> 00:05:17.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.791
But a lot of you
in this room might

00:05:19.791 --> 00:05:21.290
identify-- raise
your hand if you've

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.750
read Susan Cain's book "Quiet."

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.250
I'll ask that.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.250
Well, you all should
totally read that after you

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.000
read "Wired to Create."

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
She's wonderful, and
she wrote this book

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.170
about why it's important
to understand introversion

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.080
and what it is, and give
people opportunities

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.400
who aren't necessarily the first
one to speak at the meeting,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.710
for instance, or
the one who doesn't

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.390
like to be put on the spot,
to come up with answers.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.960
And a big part of
what we learned

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.905
through this scientific
investigation of creativity

00:05:50.905 --> 00:05:52.280
is that a lot of
great creativity

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.219
comes through solitude,
comes through daydreaming.

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.760
It comes through
things that we don't

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:00.562
promote in our school system,
and often in the workplace.

00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:01.520
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.530
Like Scott was saying,
introversion and exploration

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:06.540
was a central
contradiction that we

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:10.015
explored within a
series of paradoxes

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:11.731
seen in highly creative people.

00:06:11.731 --> 00:06:13.230
There was a really
interesting study

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.000
done on heavy metal
musicians which

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.800
found that they actually are
very sensitive and introverted,

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.790
and say things backstage
like they need lots of time

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:26.840
by themselves and they enjoy
daydreaming and engaging

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.960
in a world of fantasy, and
that they are easily disrupted

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.870
by loud noises-- which is a
very strange thing to hear

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:35.750
from a heavy metal musician.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.520
But again and again in the
lives of different types

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.780
of creative people, we see
these very startling contrasts.

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.150
So these heavy metal musicians
were very bold and brash

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.214
onstage, and that was
very much something

00:06:49.214 --> 00:06:50.630
a part of themselves
and something

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:52.080
that they enjoyed doing.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.450
So they did have extroversion
in that sense, and charisma.

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.910
But they were also very shy,
very often isolated, sensitive,

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:01.140
introverted.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.380
And so these contradictions are
pretty much across the board

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.407
present in people who
have eminent creative work

00:07:08.407 --> 00:07:09.240
that they have done.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.900
And this is partly
because-- well, it's

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.460
possible that these sort
of inner tensions that we

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.070
feel within ourselves give
rise to the desire to create.

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.240
And it's actually been found
that creative writers score

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.940
both in the top 10% of
the general population

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.430
on tests of mental
illness, and also

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:30.290
in the top 15% on
tests of mental health.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:32.400
So how is that possible?

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.380
It may be that people who
are driven to create just

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:39.097
are more open to this
broad sense of themselves,

00:07:39.097 --> 00:07:41.180
are more intimate with
both the dark and the light

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:41.990
within themselves.

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.250
And that may be
sort of a catalyst

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.460
for creative exploration,
for creativity

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:48.802
as a way of trying to
understand themselves.

00:07:48.802 --> 00:07:49.220
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Yeah.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:50.910
We're starting to see
this a bit in the brain.

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:51.760
We're doing neuroscience.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.259
Do we have anyone
in this room who's

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:54.910
interested in
neuroscience at all?

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:56.430
Oh, excellent.

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.200
So we found that
three major brain

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.290
networks are important
for the creative process.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:04.550
Traditionally, what's called
the executive attention network

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.052
has been considered
the most important one.

00:08:07.052 --> 00:08:08.510
And the executive
attention network

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.280
involves your ability to
focus on the outside world,

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.120
to hold lots of different bits
of information in your head

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.490
at once and integrate them.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.009
When you're programming, when
you're really focusing-- let's

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:22.050
say you're going through
like 5,000 lines of code

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.091
to find that one mistake.

00:08:23.091 --> 00:08:26.250
The executive attention
network is extremely important.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:28.087
But a very under-rated
brain network

00:08:28.087 --> 00:08:29.670
that's been discovered
in recent years

00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:31.870
is called the default
mode brain network.

00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.210
It was discovered accidentally
by a cognitive neuroscience,

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:37.650
because cognitive
neuroscientists weren't

00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:40.970
interested in what was
going on in your own head

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.380
while you were being part of a
experiment that wasn't related

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.640
to the actual experiment.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.534
So if the experimenter
is like, is this line

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:48.450
bigger than this line?

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:53.620
Or comprehend this boring
reading comprehension passage--

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:55.740
any of your daydreaming,
any of your fantasies,

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:57.190
your future
thoughts, strivings--

00:08:57.190 --> 00:09:00.130
all that was considered
noise in the laboratory.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:03.820
Until recently, some really--
am I allowed to say "badass?"

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.290
Badass neuroscientists
were like,

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:08.840
we wonder if there's any
value at all to what's

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.260
going on by default
in their head.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.830
What is that cognition
when we're not

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:14.130
telling them what to do?

00:09:14.130 --> 00:09:16.410
And it opened up this
whole new line of research

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:19.270
in cognitive neuroscience, this
discovery of the default mode

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.044
network.

00:09:20.044 --> 00:09:21.710
We like to call it
the imagination brain

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.485
network, because it turns
out this network is not

00:09:24.485 --> 00:09:27.290
just associated with
daydreaming and mind-wandering

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.370
and imagination, but
it's also associated

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:31.680
with making meaning out
of your experiences.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.040
When you disrupt
this brain network,

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.450
you find that you also see
disruptions in sense of self

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.520
and your capacity to create
a narrative about your life

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:42.930
and make meaning.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.719
Of course-- maybe
it's not of course,

00:09:44.719 --> 00:09:46.760
but did you know that the
self is a construction?

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.880
It's not actually a
thing, a real thing

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.540
we discovered physically?

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.400
Oh, there's the self.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.860
This is a very age-old question.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:58.970
But what we do know
is our self-concept.

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:01.611
And it's constantly
being revised.

00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:03.110
Our self-concept
is constantly being

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.400
revised by other
people's opinions of us

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.192
and by our own opinions
of ourselves, which

00:10:07.192 --> 00:10:07.941
is very important.

00:10:07.941 --> 00:10:10.250
It influences how we engage
with others in the world.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:11.850
And you find this
imagination is very

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:14.647
important for that
natural process.

00:10:14.647 --> 00:10:16.730
So we find those two brain
networks are important.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.100
And there's a
third brain network

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:19.141
that is very under-rated.

00:10:19.141 --> 00:10:20.880
It's called the
salience brain network.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.460
And that's associated with your
ability-- not your ability,

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.267
but motivation.

00:10:24.267 --> 00:10:25.850
How much do things
in your environment

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:27.240
capture your attention?

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:31.370
His salience network wasn't
activated in this talk-- maybe.

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.014
I don't know.

00:10:33.014 --> 00:10:34.430
But the salience
network is really

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.060
important for
helping to tag things

00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.025
as relevant or irrelevant.

00:10:38.025 --> 00:10:39.650
So if you're in a
really boring lecture

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:43.900
or you're in a boring--
most of us in school

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.060
were forced to pay
attention to a teacher.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.577
And that salience network
has passed the baton over

00:10:48.577 --> 00:10:50.160
to the imagination
network, and that's

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.560
when we start daydreaming
and mind-wandering.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.060
But when that
salience network says,

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.430
wow, that's really
interesting-- then

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:59.190
it passes the baton over to the
executive attention network,

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:00.920
and that's when we
really can focus.

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:03.870
So in a lot of ways, the
key to everything in life

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.070
is activating that
salience network, which

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:07.980
is at a subconscious level.

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:10.100
And it also is influenced
by our learning process

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.142
and our past experiences.

00:11:11.142 --> 00:11:12.100
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.080
And so where that comes
in with the personality

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.500
contradictions is
that in most people,

00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.550
the external attention network
and the internal default

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:22.271
network are at odds.

00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:24.270
We're either using one
or we're using the other,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:26.950
depending on the situation
and the task at hand.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.270
But in creative people,
something really interesting

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.860
is happening-- or when people
are engaged in creative work

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.750
and develop these
creative skills,

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.800
these brain arcs
actually harmonize,

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.300
and there's a rapid sort of
switching between the networks

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:42.880
and people become
very well equipped

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.370
at using them together.

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.970
So it's kind of
like these opposites

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:49.370
coming together, even on
the level of neurology.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:52.150
So we see in the level of
the brain and the personality

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.420
and the creative process, which
also tends to be kind of back

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.570
and forth and is not a linear
progression for most people--

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:02.370
I'm sure many of us can relate
to procrastinating and doing

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.320
nothing on a project, and then
suddenly it all comes at once.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.300
Or maybe not you guys.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.527
You made it to Google, so--

00:12:09.527 --> 00:12:11.860
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Google
can't be shut down for a day

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.193
because you guys procrastinated.

00:12:13.193 --> 00:12:14.617
We need you.

00:12:14.617 --> 00:12:16.700
You've got how many people
million people every 20

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.199
seconds?

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:19.270
What does it say up there.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:21.140
CAROLYN GREGOIRE:
But even Picasso

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.100
late in his career, when he had
made thousands of paintings,

00:12:25.100 --> 00:12:28.460
his process still didn't
look to be what you would

00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.072
expect from a seasoned painter.

00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:31.530
He would kind of
go back and forth,

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:36.017
and he would create sketches
that sometimes would have

00:12:36.017 --> 00:12:37.600
a sort of linear
progression, and then

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.614
he would go back
to the earliest one

00:12:39.614 --> 00:12:41.030
and then put that
in the painting.

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:42.738
And it would seem to
be this process more

00:12:42.738 --> 00:12:45.030
of blind experimentation
than any sort

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.939
of logical, orderly
sort of process.

00:12:47.939 --> 00:12:49.480
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Let me tell them

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.950
about a study that came out
after our book was published

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:53.600
that is really interesting.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.725
We're kind of having a new
understanding of personality

00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:57.600
and the way it works.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.600
Raise your hand if you
think the way personality

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.430
works is it's something that you
have these stable dispositions

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.870
that don't really change that
much throughout your life?

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.842
Raise your hand if you
think that's-- OK, good.

00:13:07.842 --> 00:13:09.050
Good.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:12.250
So it turns out that, through
the course of our day--

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.430
I feel I can get really
technical with this audience

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:16.263
and you guys will really
get me, so I'm just

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:17.220
going to be technical.

00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:19.190
So the way we think
of personality now

00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:21.000
is density distributions.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.260
So each one of us has
a density distribution

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.029
for a whole wide
range of traits.

00:13:25.029 --> 00:13:27.570
But what that means is that it's
kind of like you have a bell

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.400
curve throughout
the day of-- no one

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.340
is purely extroverted
or purely introverted.

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:34.048
And what you see is
that within a person,

00:13:34.048 --> 00:13:36.870
you actually cycle through
every introverted-extroverted

00:13:36.870 --> 00:13:37.904
behavior.

00:13:37.904 --> 00:13:39.070
At the core we're all human.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.446
So you know how you have people
who say, I'm an introvert

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.028
and they're so proud of it, and
they're like, that's who I am.

00:13:44.028 --> 00:13:45.100
I'm never an extrovert.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.970
But if you actually follow
them throughout the day,

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:49.260
like scientifically you
follow them throughout the day

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:51.040
and you have them
report their thinking--

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.840
you find they actually
extrovert a lot more

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:54.870
than they're willing to admit.

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.395
What you do see, though, is
that their density distribution

00:13:57.395 --> 00:14:01.394
is skewed much more towards the
interviewed side on average--

00:14:01.394 --> 00:14:02.810
not even on average,
just in terms

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.060
of the skew of a distribution.

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:06.670
And we're starting
to extend that now

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.190
to things that have normally
been non-clinical traits,

00:14:10.190 --> 00:14:13.474
like narcissism for instance--
things like schizophrenia.

00:14:13.474 --> 00:14:15.890
It actually turns out that
these things were breaking down

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.880
the boundaries of what
these things mean between,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.630
oh, there's the clinical
people that we put them

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:21.296
in the mental institution
who have that,

00:14:21.296 --> 00:14:24.220
and then there are the rest
of us who are not in clinical.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:24.980
We're good.

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.740
But we're not good,
you Know Or they're

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:32.170
not bad, is how I prefer
a positive spin on it.

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:35.060
And so how this relates is that
when you look at the brain,

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:39.060
you find that actually
there's a lot of similarities

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:41.800
between schizophrenic patients
and creative people when

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.405
you ask them to
solve creative tasks.

00:14:43.405 --> 00:14:44.780
That's where I'm
going with this.

00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.130
I wanted to tie it all together.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:48.130
You actually find there's
a lot of similarities.

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.620
Where the differences
are is when

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.620
you follow them throughout
the course of the day

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.120
and you find that actually,
creative people are

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.490
more able to return to reality.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:01.090
So they're equally as capable
of jumping out and taking a risk

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.680
and thinking really
imaginatively

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.931
and quote psychotically.

00:15:04.931 --> 00:15:06.930
But what they're able to
do throughout their day

00:15:06.930 --> 00:15:09.150
is their density
distribution of schizophrenia

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:13.630
is much less skewed to
the one and the other

00:15:13.630 --> 00:15:14.842
for schizophrenic patients.

00:15:14.842 --> 00:15:17.300
And that's a new emerging way
of thinking about personality

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.230
that I think is going to
have profound implications

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:20.090
in the coming years.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:21.660
Does that make sense?

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:22.618
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:15:22.618 --> 00:15:25.270
And going back to this finding
that creative writers were

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:28.640
sort of both more mentally
ill and more mentally healthy

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:34.640
than other people, I think part
of the mentally ill aspect--

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.610
part of the aspect that is
related to mental illness

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.840
is so something
called schizotypy

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:43.020
is a spectrum ranging
on one end, which

00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:45.490
is sort of imaginativeness
and on the other, full-blown

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.600
schizophrenia.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.200
And so what's been
found is highly

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.840
creative people
may have just some

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.740
of the more positive traits
associated with schizophrenia,

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.500
without the more harmful ones.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.650
So that would be things
like magical thinking

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:04.070
and a tendency to see patterns
and to find order and disorder,

00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:08.030
and very unusual perceptions
or heightened perceptions.

00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:11.190
So maybe if they're
listening to chimes,

00:16:11.190 --> 00:16:13.090
they would hear more
sound in the chimes

00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.160
than the average person would.

00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.950
And so these are things
that our society associates

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.100
with mental illness,
but I've been thinking

00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:21.720
of this list of traits.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.600
Do they really seem so
negative, and can that actually

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.640
maybe lead us to
reconsider mental illness

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:31.950
and how we treat mental
disorders in our culture?

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:33.770
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Absolutely.

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:35.430
Did we want to do a Q&amp;A?

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:36.810
How are we doing on time?

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:37.476
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:16:37.476 --> 00:16:39.440
So thank you so much
for the introduction.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.150
Reading your books, there were
some questions I did have.

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.520
And then we can have
open Q&amp;A for everyone.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.400
So we generally consider
the creative mind

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.390
restricted to a select group of
artists, scientists, writers,

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.200
or musicians.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.250
Why do you suggest that
personal creativity

00:16:58.250 --> 00:17:01.530
is important for
everyone's sense of being?

00:17:01.530 --> 00:17:03.270
It's important for
everyone's sense

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:06.967
of well-being, not just a few
selected creative artists.

00:17:06.967 --> 00:17:08.050
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Yeah.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.612
We talk about well-being
in the book a little bit,

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:10.903
so that's an exciting question.

00:17:10.903 --> 00:17:11.987
Do you want to cover that?

00:17:11.987 --> 00:17:12.944
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:17:12.944 --> 00:17:15.540
I think creativity is just
kind of a natural part of who

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:16.339
we are.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:19.260
And we see this in the
case of children at play.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:22.200
Play is not a thing that some
children do and some children

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:22.700
don't.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.420
It's actually a natural and
healthy and very important

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.470
part of child development.

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.590
And when there is not
play, there's a problem.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.110
And so from that and
from other research,

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:36.310
we can kind of deduce
that creativity is just

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:38.610
a fundamental human
characteristic.

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:42.500
And so it doesn't always
take the form of a Picasso

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:47.260
or a genius musician, but
creativity is just-- I mean,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:50.452
we define it as-- well, I
guess science defines it as--

00:17:50.452 --> 00:17:51.600
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: We should
have defined creativity first.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.100
CAROLYN GREGOIRE:
Science defines it

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.380
as novelty and usefulness.

00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.180
So we kind of define
it broadly as just

00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.340
bringing something
new into the world,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.220
whether that's a new
idea or just a new way

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:08.047
of seeing a problem, or a new
way of presenting something.

00:18:08.047 --> 00:18:09.630
There are so many
forms creativity can

00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.190
and so many everyday forms
that it does take-- from what

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.050
we choose to wear and
put something together

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:18.767
in a different way to the
way that we phrase just even

00:18:18.767 --> 00:18:20.600
a sentence in an email
that has a little bit

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:23.177
more personal meaning.

00:18:23.177 --> 00:18:25.260
I think everyone is creative,
and you can't really

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:27.520
escape creativity when you
look at it in that sense.

00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.200
And so the more
we do exercise it

00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.600
and the more we do bring
new things into the world

00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:36.180
and bring some sort
of self-expression

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.830
into what we do, generally,
the more joy that we'll

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:40.960
have in our lives.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.170
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Yeah.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:42.380
There's definitely
research showing

00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:43.930
that everyday
forms of creativity

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.280
is correlated with
feeling vitality

00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:49.760
in life, optimism, a sense
of meaning in your life.

00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:51.230
So it's very true.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:53.570
And at the highest levels,
at the genius level,

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:56.910
it is a myth that mental illness
is required for creativity.

00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:58.520
I want to be very
clear about that.

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.530
But when you find
is an association,

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.050
because a lot of people who
have had very harsh childhood

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:06.229
experiences are
actually overrepresented

00:19:06.229 --> 00:19:07.020
in creative fields.

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.920
People who've had some
hardships in their childhood

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.110
is actually over-represented
in the history books.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.890
And a lot of psychologists
are trying to figure out why.

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:14.100
What's going on there?

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:16.140
Is it that you need
to have hardships

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.150
in order to be creative?

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.290
And it turns out
that these hardships

00:19:19.290 --> 00:19:22.650
create a sense of
otherness in them that

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:24.630
allows them to see a
world in a different way,

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:26.200
allows them to step back.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.759
And also, it gives them more
confidence to take risks,

00:19:28.759 --> 00:19:30.800
because they're like, oh,
what do I have to lose?

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.700
I've already lost
it all pretty much.

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:35.636
So they're much more
willing to take risks.

00:19:35.636 --> 00:19:38.260
And also, another thing is that
a lot of creative people who've

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.600
had hardships, there's
an emerging field

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.100
called post-traumatic growth
that we talk about in the book.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:47.930
So a lot of them use their
hardships to grow creatively.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:52.329
So a lot of creative writers
will put it into their work.

00:19:52.329 --> 00:19:53.870
They'll write about
it in their work.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:55.536
I'm trying to think
right now in my head

00:19:55.536 --> 00:19:58.610
how you would put post-traumatic
growth into your code.

00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.134
I guess you guys can
give me some ideas what

00:20:01.134 --> 00:20:01.800
that would like.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.390
How can you take out all
your frustrations on the code

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.420
that you're doing?

00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.980
I'd love to hear that.

00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.370
But you do find in a whole
wide range of creative fields,

00:20:11.370 --> 00:20:13.820
a lot of people have
had these hardships,

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.240
and creativity is
healing for them.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.305
There's art therapy.

00:20:17.305 --> 00:20:18.930
There's all these
emerging fields where

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:20.764
creativity can be very healing.

00:20:20.764 --> 00:20:22.430
We talk about journaling
in the book has

00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:25.950
been shown to be really
important for healing trauma.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.371
So I wanted to make that point.

00:20:28.371 --> 00:20:30.614
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:20:30.614 --> 00:20:32.030
So throughout the
book, you always

00:20:32.030 --> 00:20:34.534
mention messy minds and messy
brains, messy emotions--

00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:36.200
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Everything's messy.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:37.450
SPEAKER 1: Everything's messy.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:39.620
So what are the
conflicting mental states

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.604
that creativity draws upon
that you can think of?

00:20:43.604 --> 00:20:45.020
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Well, we were

00:20:45.020 --> 00:20:47.520
talking about that a little
bit with the brain activation.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.340
So you have what's called
spontaneous cognition.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.470
You have more
controlled cognition.

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:55.070
You have more reflective.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:58.290
We talk about intuition in the
book and why that's important,

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.890
and drawing on your intuition
to a certain degree,

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:03.920
drawing on your
personal experiences.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.870
We talk about mind-wandering.

00:21:05.870 --> 00:21:08.671
Then I'll pass the baton to
you, Carolyn, talk a little bit

00:21:08.671 --> 00:21:09.442
about mindfulness.

00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:10.400
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.350
So one of the other
contradictions we explored

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:14.610
is mindfulness and daydreaming.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.649
Daydreaming is really
important for creativity,

00:21:16.649 --> 00:21:18.690
because it's activating
the default mode network.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.777
So often, we'll come
up with an insight

00:21:21.777 --> 00:21:23.110
when the mind is just wandering.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:25.430
This is why so many
people actually

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.562
do come up with great
ideas in the shower,

00:21:27.562 --> 00:21:29.520
because it's this place
where your mind is just

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.140
kind of mellowing.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.200
But it's still kind of at
work in the background.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.010
You're maybe thinking
about something,

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.546
but not too hard, and then
something completely unrelated

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:38.420
comes into your mind.

00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:42.340
So daydreaming-- I mean, that's
a whole other can of worms.

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:44.660
But it's very critical
to creative thinking.

00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.090
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: I did an
international study on showers,

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.810
and more people reported
creative insights in the shower

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:52.515
than they did at work.

00:21:52.515 --> 00:21:53.890
CAROLYN GREGOIRE:
So day-dreaming

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:57.590
is pretty critical to the
creative thinking processes.

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.940
But mindfulness is as well.

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:03.720
It's easy to see how we need
to be able to focus and to pay

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:07.680
attention, and to really sustain
our attention on whatever we're

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.700
doing in order to
actually do creative work.

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:13.320
So we kind of need daydreaming
for this idea generation,

00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.240
and then mindfulness
for actually making

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.340
our ideas become a reality.

00:22:17.340 --> 00:22:22.390
And so these kind of thinking
processes can be at odds,

00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:25.350
but creative people do tend
to find a kind of synthesis

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.560
between them.

00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:30.170
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: With that
said, we debate often a lot

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.140
whether expert mindful
people, are they creative?

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:35.030
And that's still a
question open for debate.

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:38.070
But the research is kind
of mixed in that, showing

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.190
that too much mindfulness on
the outside world or too much

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.105
focus does limit your career
potential in a lot of ways

00:22:44.105 --> 00:22:45.480
if you don't have
the flexibility

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:48.870
to go back and daydream as
well about what you've learned.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.110
So that's what we're seeing.

00:22:50.110 --> 00:22:50.550
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.258
And actually, certain
types of meditation

00:22:52.258 --> 00:22:55.410
are better than others when
it comes to stimulating

00:22:55.410 --> 00:22:56.270
creative thinking.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:59.811
Does anyone practice TM,
transcendental meditation?

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:00.310
No?

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.380
I'm surprised.

00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:06.264
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Does anyone
do meditation in any form?

00:23:06.264 --> 00:23:07.930
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: So
forms of meditation

00:23:07.930 --> 00:23:12.190
that sort of encourage awareness
of the internal thought

00:23:12.190 --> 00:23:15.120
processes-- we can be mindful
to actually our own thoughts

00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:16.550
and our own imagination.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:18.670
We usually think of
mindfulness as being

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:22.630
mindful to the external world,
to the present moment in terms

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:23.880
of our immediate surroundings.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:27.340
But sometimes meditation,
like transcendental meditation

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:30.550
and open monitoring
meditation, encourage

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.710
becoming more mindful
of everything that's

00:23:32.710 --> 00:23:35.010
in our internal landscape.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.610
So there is an ability
to allow the mind

00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.190
to wander, to pay
attention to that,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:40.960
and then to bring it back.

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.040
And these types of
meditations, more so

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.960
than a very strict,
intense zen meditation

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.710
where you're focusing
just very intensely

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.490
on some external
object-- these tend

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.214
to be more effective
for creativity,

00:23:54.214 --> 00:23:56.380
because they're bringing
together those two thinking

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.430
processes.

00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:59.630
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:02.210
I would also like to
open the floor for anyone

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:03.830
if you have any Q&amp;A questions.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.324
If not, then OK.

00:24:06.324 --> 00:24:06.824
Sure.

00:24:09.818 --> 00:24:13.740
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering,
from this knowledge, what

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.127
is the actionable
thing that we can do?

00:24:17.127 --> 00:24:18.960
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
That's a fair question.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.940
Fair question.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:22.580
Scientists cringe a little bit
when they get that question,

00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:24.371
because they're like,
that's not what I do.

00:24:24.371 --> 00:24:26.440
It's not what I do.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.500
But people want to know.

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:31.455
And we talk about some
actionable things in this book.

00:24:31.455 --> 00:24:32.830
And I think the
best way to think

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:36.090
about it is that creativity is
a way of being in the world.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.340
Don't think of creativity
as only this thing

00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:39.780
that geniuses do.

00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:41.610
It's a way of relating
to your world.

00:24:41.610 --> 00:24:43.818
And we really feel, to the
extent to which you follow

00:24:43.818 --> 00:24:46.175
these 10 things
in this book, you

00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:48.355
are in effect living
a creative lifestyle.

00:24:48.355 --> 00:24:49.730
And you're increasing
the chances

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:51.190
there'll be creative insights.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:52.590
It's very important
to build time

00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:55.800
into your day to have solitude.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.410
Too many meetings is going
to stifle creativity,

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:02.600
if there are any project
managers listening to that.

00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.080
It's really important to
constantly push yourself out

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.210
of your comfort zone.

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:10.150
We have a whole chapter on
openness to new experiences

00:25:10.150 --> 00:25:13.060
and how it's going to be
really super important.

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:19.410
Building time to daydream
and reflect, like journal

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:21.067
about your
experiences and really

00:25:21.067 --> 00:25:22.400
get a chance to understand that.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:24.110
What are some other things?

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.590
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: I think one
of the most important things

00:25:26.590 --> 00:25:29.800
is openness to experience,
which we have a big chapter on.

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.650
And this is actually
a personality trait

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:34.210
that's the number one predictor
of creative achievement

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.934
across all fields
in arts and science.

00:25:36.934 --> 00:25:38.850
And so this can take a
lot of different forms.

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:43.050
But really, any sort of
new experiences or new ways

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.790
of approaching things,
or even walking

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.400
a different way to work--
that sounds so trivial,

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.900
but just rewiring
your brain patterns

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:53.820
and getting into
a different state

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.350
actually makes a
very big difference,

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.920
and it can sort of,
on subtle levels,

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.910
and then eventually
on larger levels,

00:25:59.910 --> 00:26:03.080
change the way that you think
and give way to new ideas.

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:05.730
So people who have
studied abroad,

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.450
they've done studies and
found that they perform better

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.540
on tests of creative thinking
after college students study

00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:12.040
abroad.

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:15.787
And people who-- what are
some of the other ones?

00:26:15.787 --> 00:26:17.120
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Immigrants.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.078
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:26:18.078 --> 00:26:22.080
Immigrants tend to bring this
influx of art and culture

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.960
into a new place, which
stimulates broader,

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.400
societal-wide shifts in thinking
and in art and science and tech

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.380
and that kind of thing.

00:26:32.380 --> 00:26:32.810
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Totally.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:35.470
The big thing is to keep
cycling through your mindsets,

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.460
your modes of thinking.

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:37.960
Keep cycling all
throughout the day.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.810
Don't get stuck.

00:26:39.810 --> 00:26:42.110
If you're focusing on a
problem and you're like,

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.490
OK, let's stay up all night.

00:26:43.490 --> 00:26:44.920
We're going to solve this,
and we're not leaving

00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.010
till we solve this problem.

00:26:46.010 --> 00:26:47.718
That's very unlikely
we're going to solve

00:26:47.718 --> 00:26:49.206
the problem that night.

00:26:49.206 --> 00:26:51.560
It's really important to
have that time to cycle

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:53.180
through these different
mental states,

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.255
because we know that's how
creativity works in the brain.

00:26:57.255 --> 00:26:58.130
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.250
AUDIENCE: OK, so it sounds like
diversity of new experiences

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.200
is really important to
help train creativity.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.700
I think you mentioned journaling
a few different times-- one

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.090
as a way to deal with
trauma, and also as a way to,

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:13.770
I think improve creativity.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:14.515
Did you say that?

00:27:14.515 --> 00:27:15.890
Could you elaborate
a little more

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:17.817
on journaling and its effect?

00:27:17.817 --> 00:27:18.900
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Yeah.

00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:21.880
What it requires is that
you're actively and cognitively

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:24.410
processing what has happened
to you throughout the day,

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.800
and that you're making meaning.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.610
You're trying to actually
tie it to your life--

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.010
your past experiences,
your future experiences.

00:27:34.965 --> 00:27:36.340
Before you go to
bed every night,

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:38.600
we know in positive
psychology it's

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.510
good to write and reflect
on the things that

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:43.955
went wrong during the day and
then say, what was the point?

00:27:43.955 --> 00:27:45.080
What can I learn from that?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.160
Constantly be in
problem-based mode.

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.130
And then also, write
three good things

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:51.445
that you're happy about that
day before you go to bed.

00:27:51.445 --> 00:27:53.320
So it's called the three
good things exercise

00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.890
that I teach my students in
my positive psychology class.

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:57.810
And that makes it
much more likely

00:27:57.810 --> 00:28:03.980
that you will wake up the next
day feeling more ready and able

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.290
to tackle the day.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.564
And you could see how
that positive emotions--

00:28:07.564 --> 00:28:09.230
we know positive
emotions are correlated

00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.780
with creativity and probability
for creative thinking,

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.840
and insightful thinking.

00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.930
So to the extent to
which you put that

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:19.789
into your journals, that allows
you to have fresh outlooks

00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:21.830
and perspectives on life
that's going to increase

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.430
your creativity, I would think.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:27.670
If you want specific exercises,
you can email me, though.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:29.300
There's some great
stuff by Pennebaker

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.167
and others that can get
you started right away.

00:28:32.167 --> 00:28:33.250
AUDIENCE: Cool, thank you.

00:28:36.571 --> 00:28:38.820
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: By the
way, I went to high school

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.480
with these three.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:45.394
And it's so surreal that
they're sitting there right now.

00:28:45.394 --> 00:28:46.560
They're really good friends.

00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.393
AUDIENCE: Hi, Scott.

00:28:47.393 --> 00:28:48.510
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Hey.

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.940
AUDIENCE: What would you say
makes society value or not

00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.420
value creativity?

00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:56.016
Why are there are so
many starving artists?

00:28:56.016 --> 00:28:57.890
Why do you hear about
the painter who becomes

00:28:57.890 --> 00:29:00.160
famous only after his death?

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.350
Why do we want to consume so
much content, but maybe not pay

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:04.650
for it?

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:09.522
What are some of your
psychology thoughts on that?

00:29:09.522 --> 00:29:11.480
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: I
think I'm talking a lot.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.950
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah, I'll
just jump in really quick.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:13.770
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: I
feel like I'm yakking.

00:29:13.770 --> 00:29:15.145
CAROLYN GREGOIRE:
I think we sort

00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:17.570
of value creativity in theory.

00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:20.480
We celebrate, obviously,
great musicians

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.080
and artists and innovators,
and kind of hold them up

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:25.450
and put them on pedestals.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.910
But we tend to not look at
what it took to actually get

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:32.480
there, and the sort of
challenges that are inherent,

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.770
and the failures
that are inherent

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:36.580
to the creative process.

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.760
And especially, you see
this in schools for sure,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:41.730
and also in a lot
of organizations.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:44.780
I expect that Google is a little
more progressive on this front.

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:48.600
But most organizations say
that they desire innovation,

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.777
and that they want
creative new products.

00:29:50.777 --> 00:29:51.860
They want creative people.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.318
They want to do
things differently.

00:29:53.318 --> 00:29:59.470
But they're actually
completely unwilling to make

00:29:59.470 --> 00:30:01.210
the sacrifices
that that requires.

00:30:01.210 --> 00:30:04.802
So that's allowing people to
maybe have more freedom, or--

00:30:04.802 --> 00:30:06.510
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Pretty much choosing

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.920
what project you
want to work on.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:10.740
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah,
allowing people to sort of think

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:13.330
about things in a new way, or
kind of write their own rules

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.660
in some sense, or
just accepting failure

00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:19.240
as a path to doing something
really differently.

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:21.430
So really, I think
in the workplaces

00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:23.930
and in schools is where
we see that the most.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:25.013
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Yeah.

00:30:25.013 --> 00:30:26.414
And in schools, for sure.

00:30:26.414 --> 00:30:27.830
I mean, we have
this whole culture

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.370
of standardized testing.

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:30.580
So we teach to the test.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.270
So we don't have a
revision process.

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:36.110
There's something like, you
got a D. You're like, OK,

00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.750
I'm screwed.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:41.290
I got a D. As opposed to,
look, you didn't fail.

00:30:41.290 --> 00:30:44.030
You've got a D. So there's still
stuff we can work out here.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.800
They don't frame it
that way in school.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.000
There's so many ways
we could be framing

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.042
things that make
school like, oh, this

00:30:52.042 --> 00:30:53.250
is all about personal growth.

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:55.900
This is all about--
our book is very much

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.700
a personal-growth-oriented
book, I will say.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.410
Do you agree?

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.960
This book is not about-- I
have most respect recorded

00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.390
and everything for my
colleague Angela Duckworth

00:31:06.390 --> 00:31:09.700
and the work on grit and all
that-- very important work.

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:13.100
But we also think that
sometimes, the process itself,

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.100
without the goal-oriented
aspect of it,

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:19.900
can be even more
conducive to creativity

00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.682
than being specifically
goal-oriented.

00:31:22.682 --> 00:31:23.640
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Yeah.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.500
I think also, our
obsession with efficiency

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.170
is kind of at odds with
creative work, which

00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:32.440
is a bit more meandering
and doesn't always

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.690
have a clear outcome.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.050
And this starts so early now.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:39.120
I think even preschool kids
have so little free time,

00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:42.970
like 30% less than
they did in the '70s.

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:47.000
So that's just not really-- if
we want people to sort of let

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.990
their minds go and
come up with new things

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.510
and change the
paradigm, it's not

00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:56.090
going to come from squeezing
activities into slots,

00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:59.990
and not trying to write a
book in a really short period

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.600
or come up with a new product
in a ridiculously short period,

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:03.960
because you're just
going and going

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.251
and moving onto the next thing.

00:32:05.251 --> 00:32:07.460
That's just not really--
creativity works

00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.369
in a completely different way.

00:32:09.369 --> 00:32:11.910
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: I mean, I
hope this stuff doesn't-- some

00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:15.320
of it may sound really corny,
or really like soft, right?

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.880
If I said to you, you really
should make in your day

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.960
a play break where you
literally-- there's

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:24.660
45 minutes you could
call anyone at work

00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:27.620
and be like, let's play Frisbee.

00:32:27.620 --> 00:32:28.870
You think that's corny, right?

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:30.350
You'd be like, ugh.

00:32:30.350 --> 00:32:33.440
But there is research showing
that actually, the more that

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.467
you build a play
mindset into work,

00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:39.050
the more that you come back and
you're more likely to actually

00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.430
solve the problem.

00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:44.060
So I think it's stuff that
really matters, even though we

00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.090
kind of look down on it.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.809
Yeah.

00:32:49.809 --> 00:32:51.600
AUDIENCE: So I noticed
most of the research

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.660
seems to be done on
artists, musicians,

00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.570
the fields we traditionally
think of as creative.

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.820
Is it because it's easy
to study those sorts of--

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.660
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
They want to studied.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:05.404
Artists love it.

00:33:05.404 --> 00:33:06.570
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering--

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:09.258
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Tell
me more about myself.

00:33:09.258 --> 00:33:10.660
Sorry.

00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.440
AUDIENCE: Is the research
done on those manifestations

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.320
of creativity applicable
to maybe the sorts

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:16.920
that we're interested
here in terms

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:20.750
of solving technical
or scientific problems?

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:22.690
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Totally fair question.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.290
I think so.

00:33:23.290 --> 00:33:26.654
I mean, I've looked at
research on the sciences.

00:33:26.654 --> 00:33:28.070
So we don't just
look at the arts,

00:33:28.070 --> 00:33:29.903
but I've also done
research in the sciences.

00:33:29.903 --> 00:33:32.790
And we find that
intellectual curiosity

00:33:32.790 --> 00:33:34.970
is a very strong predictor
of creative achievement

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.570
in the sciences, much
more than in the arts.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:39.960
The arts, openness to
experience was more important.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.990
But we find that more
high-level abstract sort

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.390
of level of reasoning, level
of intellectual curiosity--

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.750
like coming up with lots
of different possibilities

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:50.810
and really being open
in an intellectual way--

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.760
is a much better predictor
of scientific achievement.

00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:56.970
So we found that.

00:33:56.970 --> 00:33:59.810
I don't know if there's any
real in-depth longitudinal

00:33:59.810 --> 00:34:03.070
study of computer scientists.

00:34:03.070 --> 00:34:05.520
To me, I don't know if
such a study has been done.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.330
Although I lived with a computer
scientist for a couple years,

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.080
and I have some case studies.

00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.199
I don't know if any real-- yeah?

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.670
AUDIENCE: I was curious, have
you encountered any research

00:34:18.670 --> 00:34:22.330
on people using
lucid dreaming to tap

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:23.844
into their creative sources?

00:34:23.844 --> 00:34:24.639
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Oh, the next question's

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:25.805
going to be drugs, isn't it?

00:34:25.805 --> 00:34:27.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:29.920
The gateway question is
always the lucid dreaming.

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:33.250
The next one is always LSD.

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.300
Admit it, someone
had that waiting.

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:38.469
Lucid dreaming is a
fascinating phenomenon.

00:34:38.469 --> 00:34:41.350
And it is possible
to train yourself.

00:34:41.350 --> 00:34:43.610
It's not guaranteed
if you train yourself.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:47.029
But the normal
areas of the brain--

00:34:47.029 --> 00:34:49.570
remember I was talking about
the executive attention network?

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:53.560
Well, that's normally
silence when we're dreaming.

00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:57.690
And that's why our dreams tend
to be so bizarre, because there

00:34:57.690 --> 00:35:02.530
is no higher order of control
that is making it organized.

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:04.450
So it's sort of like
every person for themself

00:35:04.450 --> 00:35:06.830
in your dreams-- like anything
goes, and then you wake up

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:08.913
and you're horrified that
you just had that dream.

00:35:08.913 --> 00:35:11.830
You're like, I'm not telling
anyone about that one.

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:14.570
But you can actually
train in a lucid way

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:16.400
to activate your
executive attention

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.150
network during dreaming.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:20.590
And it's really
surreal when you do

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:24.330
that, like literally
surreal because you're like,

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:29.370
I'm able to take an active role
in organizing the structure

00:35:29.370 --> 00:35:31.165
of this dream right now.

00:35:31.165 --> 00:35:31.970
You know what?

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:35.540
I'm going to walk through that
door right now in the dream.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.130
And people can be
trained to do that.

00:35:37.130 --> 00:35:38.060
It's fascinating.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.580
Now, you didn't
ask this question,

00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.205
but I am curious--
the extent to which,

00:35:41.205 --> 00:35:42.720
are lucid dreamers
more creative?

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.350
And that's an
interesting question,

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.641
and I don't think any study
has ever been done on that.

00:35:46.641 --> 00:35:50.470
But there is some emerging
research on LSD and creativity,

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:54.320
if anyone's interested in that--
which Carolyn can talk about.

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:56.570
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Well, I
was actually just going to--

00:35:56.570 --> 00:35:57.100
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Did
he have another question?

00:35:57.100 --> 00:35:57.945
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: Oh, sorry.

00:35:57.945 --> 00:35:58.510
Go ahead.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:00.590
Well, another thing
sleep-related-- or

00:36:00.590 --> 00:36:04.630
dreaming-related,
rather-- is hypnagogia

00:36:04.630 --> 00:36:06.700
is this state between
sleep and wakefulness.

00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.200
I don't know if you ever-- this
sometimes happens to me when

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.700
I'm meditating,
which probably means

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.010
I'm not a very good meditator--
when you are sort of almost

00:36:14.010 --> 00:36:16.210
asleep, and your brain
is just in that place

00:36:16.210 --> 00:36:18.620
where it's spitting nonsense?

00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:21.490
That is actually a really
creatively fertile time,

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:23.450
because your brain
is going into REM,

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:26.080
but it's also cycling
through things

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.029
that have happened in the day,
like memories and ideas and all

00:36:29.029 --> 00:36:29.570
these things.

00:36:29.570 --> 00:36:31.630
So have the benefits
of sleep in terms

00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:35.890
of loosening cognitive control,
but then also your mind

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:38.050
is still active.

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.400
So a lot of people have
tried to harness this.

00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.730
I think Dali did some
sort of weird experiment

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:45.591
where he took a nap and
had something roll down

00:36:45.591 --> 00:36:48.090
his hand slowly, and then when
it felt like he would wake up

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:49.506
so he caught himself
in that state

00:36:49.506 --> 00:36:51.232
before he actually fell asleep.

00:36:51.232 --> 00:36:53.690
So that's kind of an interesting
thing to pay attention to.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.840
It can be difficult to remember
the insights of that time,

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.470
but it's like your
brain is loosening

00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:04.400
the control and the filter,
and more and more is coming in.

00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.937
So it's worth paying attention
to and exploring a little bit.

00:37:07.937 --> 00:37:09.020
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: Yeah.

00:37:09.020 --> 00:37:12.100
Also, two glasses of wine
improves your creativity,

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:13.280
as well.

00:37:13.280 --> 00:37:15.800
It is good to reduce the
executive functions a little

00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.280
bit, but not completely.

00:37:21.230 --> 00:37:23.280
AUDIENCE: So besides
drugs and meditation,

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:25.150
what can you do
to train yourself

00:37:25.150 --> 00:37:27.215
to lose control and
become more creative?

00:37:27.215 --> 00:37:28.840
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: There
are cutesy little exercises--

00:37:28.840 --> 00:37:29.870
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: That's
a really good question.

00:37:29.870 --> 00:37:30.930
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN: --that
scientists are working on.

00:37:30.930 --> 00:37:33.150
Yeah, it is a great question.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:37.500
The science of creativity
in terms of developing it

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.501
is an underdeveloped field.

00:37:40.501 --> 00:37:42.250
At the Imagination
Institute where I work,

00:37:42.250 --> 00:37:45.070
we've just done a $3
million grant competition

00:37:45.070 --> 00:37:46.940
where we had people
from all over the world

00:37:46.940 --> 00:37:48.710
try to provide us
with their ideas

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.690
on how we can
improve imagination

00:37:50.690 --> 00:37:52.720
and measure it as well.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.477
And the results
of those projects,

00:37:54.477 --> 00:37:56.310
which are listed on the
Imagination website,

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.150
will be out next year.

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:00.360
And we hope-- we've
given them money.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.020
I hope they did
something interesting.

00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.190
And so we'll see next
year what they found.

00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:06.170
But there are some
cutesy exercises.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:08.170
There are some exercises
where people-- have you

00:38:08.170 --> 00:38:11.720
guys heard of de Bono and stuff,
like lateral thinking exercises

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.222
and things?

00:38:12.222 --> 00:38:14.430
There are exercises you can
do where you can actively

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:18.320
put through a random
word generator

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.417
various words, things
that you're working on,

00:38:20.417 --> 00:38:21.500
your project's working on.

00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.620
And then you've got
to, as an exercise,

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:26.090
think of how are these
three related to each other,

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.200
and think creatively about that.

00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.600
The point is that you want
to get your creative juices

00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.540
stimulated.

00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.850
That didn't sound good.

00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:36.700
But you really want to get
in that-- so much of it

00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:37.880
is a mindset.

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.150
And you find that
creativity really does get

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.870
blocked when you get
too serious, too down

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:45.400
one garden path.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:49.690
Creativity is like a spreading
activation model in the brain.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.180
You're going to be most
likely do to access the most

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.640
remote associations.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:58.260
So there are exercises you
can do to kind of on-the-spot,

00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:00.940
if you feel like you're
getting too down a single path

00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:02.030
to stimulate it.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:06.452
But I hope we can come up
with better things than that.

00:39:06.452 --> 00:39:09.612
CAROLYN GREGOIRE: I don't know,
maybe hypnosis or something--

00:39:09.612 --> 00:39:11.820
if you're looking specifically
that sort of loosening

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.030
that occurs with
psychedelics and dreaming

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:17.320
and that kind of thing,
I can think of maybe

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.540
hypnosis and breath work.

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:21.770
But I'm not necessarily
suggesting those things.

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.630
But it's an interesting
question, yeah.

00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:25.880
SPEAKER 1: Well, thank you.

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.980
There was one question
that I did have.

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.590
So it was once believed that
creativity was restricted

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:34.670
to the right side of the brain.

00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:37.130
But the understandings
have changed now.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:40.810
What else has changed recently,
like after the book was

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.300
published or just that
you would want to mention?

00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:44.300
CAROLYN GREGOIRE:
That's a good question.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:44.780
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Well really,

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.030
what we were talking about,
these large-scale brain

00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:48.738
networks is a much
better way of thinking

00:39:48.738 --> 00:39:51.700
about how creativity happens
than left-brain, right-brain.

00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.980
There are some interesting
lateral specialization effects.

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:57.790
So we do know that the
right side of the brain does

00:39:57.790 --> 00:40:01.960
tend to process more non-verbal,
artistic, and the left brain

00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.300
kind of more language.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:05.800
But with that said, the
whole creative process

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.824
seems to draw on these
large-scale brain

00:40:07.824 --> 00:40:09.990
networks that operate in
the left and the right side

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.460
of the brain.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.670
And so it requires kind
of a whole-brain approach.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:17.050
I mean, if I could show you
a picture of what creativity

00:40:17.050 --> 00:40:20.370
looks like in the brain,
throughout the whole process

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.132
it's pretty much every part
is activated at some point.

00:40:24.132 --> 00:40:26.590
And that's a nice way to tie
together the whole messy minds

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:27.240
thing, as well.

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:29.340
Just like I said,
your personality--

00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:31.880
throughout the
course of your day,

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.600
no matter even if you say, I'm
an introvert, or I'm agreeable,

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.820
I'm not agreeable.

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.292
Even if you think
you're a saint,

00:40:38.292 --> 00:40:40.500
even saints, if you follow
them throughout the course

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.120
of the day, are jerks sometimes.

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:46.340
So it's constantly cycling all
throughout the thing, and kind

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:49.850
of being open and embracing that
messiness of human personality

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:51.477
structure.

00:40:51.477 --> 00:40:52.060
SPEAKER 1: OK.

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.650
Thank you so much for coming.

00:40:53.650 --> 00:40:55.650
It was great talking to you.

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.170
It was very helpful.

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:59.420
Thanks a lot, and thank
you, everyone for coming.

00:40:59.420 --> 00:40:59.960
SCOTT BARRY KAUFMAN:
Thanks for inviting us.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:01.920
SPEAKER 1: There's
books in the back.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:06.170
