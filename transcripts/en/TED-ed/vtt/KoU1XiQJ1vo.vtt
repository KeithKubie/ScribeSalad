00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:16.925
Have you ever helped set a table

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.283
and found yourself wondering

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:19.765
where to place the forks?

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:21.266
Or sat down to eat a restaurant

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.696
and wondered which utensils to use?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.282
Well, here's some simple,
traditional etiquette tips

00:00:26.306 --> 00:00:28.532
on how to set a table.

00:00:28.556 --> 00:00:31.539
What would happen if you
set a table like this?

00:00:31.563 --> 00:00:32.413
It doesn't look good,

00:00:32.437 --> 00:00:33.534
and you have to clean up the mess

00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:35.267
before you can even start.

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:37.456
Let's try another way.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.671
To start, use a placemat or tablecloth,

00:00:39.695 --> 00:00:40.726
but not both,

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.216
so the dishes aren't
directly on the table.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.145
This is more about looks than etiquette,

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:47.169
but it's rare to see nothing under a plate

00:00:47.193 --> 00:00:49.399
unless you're eating at a picnic table.

00:00:49.423 --> 00:00:50.348
Set out any flowers,

00:00:50.372 --> 00:00:51.098
candlesticks,

00:00:51.122 --> 00:00:53.072
or other decorations you like.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:55.656
Candles are usually only lit at night.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.664
Start with utensils for the main course,

00:00:57.688 --> 00:00:59.403
putting your dinner fork on the left

00:00:59.427 --> 00:01:01.526
and your dinner knife
on the right-hand side

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.854
since these are the hands
we use them with.

00:01:03.878 --> 00:01:05.111
Here's a helpful tip:

00:01:05.135 --> 00:01:06.788
You always eat outside-in,

00:01:06.812 --> 00:01:08.118
so to set for salad,

00:01:08.142 --> 00:01:09.319
we'll put the salad fork

00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:11.032
to the outside of the dinner fork

00:01:11.056 --> 00:01:14.206
and the salad knife
to the outside of the dinner knife.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.331
We'll have salad first,

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:16.916
then our main course.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.795
Notice, too, that the knife blades

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:20.753
are both pointed toward the plate.

00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:22.087
This is an old tradition

00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:24.603
from a time when dinner
knives were quite sharp,

00:01:24.627 --> 00:01:27.142
and it was a sign of politeness
and nonaggression

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.600
to keep them pointed
away from other diners.

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.895
We might have some soup,

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:33.770
and since soup usually comes first,

00:01:33.794 --> 00:01:36.065
the soup spoon goes outside the knives

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:38.358
since we use our right hand to hold it.

00:01:38.382 --> 00:01:39.776
Here's another tip:

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.945
Only set the table with what you'll need.

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.033
If you're not eating soup,

00:01:43.057 --> 00:01:44.640
don't set a soup spoon.

00:01:44.664 --> 00:01:46.658
Now, for dessert, we'll have ice cream

00:01:46.682 --> 00:01:48.254
so we'll place the dessert up top

00:01:48.278 --> 00:01:50.495
since we don't need it for a little while.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:52.091
Notice that the bowl of the spool

00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:53.749
is pointing to the left.

00:01:53.773 --> 00:01:54.916
This way, when it's time to eat,

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.191
you just slide it down

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.136
and it's in the right spot.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.117
If you were having cake,

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:01.954
you'd set a fork and flip it 180 degrees

00:02:01.978 --> 00:02:05.095
so it would be right side-up
on the left instead.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.743
Next we'll anchor
our setting with the plate.

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:09.719
You can also serve from the kitchen

00:02:09.743 --> 00:02:11.789
then bring them to the table.

00:02:11.813 --> 00:02:14.472
The bread plate goes
up and to the left of the setting,

00:02:14.496 --> 00:02:16.925
and the butter knife goes
on the plate at an angle,

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:19.320
again, with the blade pointing in.

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:20.978
There's only one spot left,

00:02:21.002 --> 00:02:22.883
and that's for the drinks.

00:02:22.907 --> 00:02:24.866
Set the wine glass to the upper right,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.611
and then place the water glass
to the left of it at an angle.

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:29.654
If you're like me

00:02:29.678 --> 00:02:31.740
and can never remember which goes where,

00:02:31.764 --> 00:02:33.117
think water, wine,

00:02:33.141 --> 00:02:34.665
w-a, w-i;

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.827
a, i;

00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:38.999
they go left to right
in alphabetical order.

00:02:39.023 --> 00:02:39.956
Another tip:

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.710
To remember left and right
with the bread and the drinks,

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:45.028
think B-M-W like the car.

00:02:45.052 --> 00:02:47.343
B, your bread plate, is on the left;

00:02:47.367 --> 00:02:49.132
M, your meal, is in the middle,

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:52.195
and W, your water, is on the right.

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.965
Lastly, the napkin traditionally
goes to the left of the forks,

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.474
though it's okay to put
it underneath them, too.

00:02:58.498 --> 00:03:00.392
For a fancier meal like this one

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:01.950
that takes up a lot of space,

00:03:01.974 --> 00:03:03.437
we'll put it in the middle.

00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.003
Now we're ready to eat.

00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:06.742
Hopefully these tips will be helpful

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:09.052
the next time you're asked
to help set the table

00:03:09.076 --> 00:03:10.585
or sit down at a fancy meal.

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:11.759
Enjoy!
