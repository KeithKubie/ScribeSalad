and believing that we can do things
differently and that we can expect

differently and that we can expect
 

00:39:07.309 --> 00:39:11.809
differently and that we can expect
higher more from each group if we give

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:17.550
those
 

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.750
those
years twenty-five years ago it was

00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760
years twenty-five years ago it was
 

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:22.040
years twenty-five years ago it was
suggesting that we wanted not just to

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.050
suggesting that we wanted not just to
 

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:23.300
suggesting that we wanted not just to
help students make it through the

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:23.310
help students make it through the
 

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.670
help students make it through the
institution but rather we wanted to do

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680
institution but rather we wanted to do
 

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:27.770
institution but rather we wanted to do
something that was bold we wanted to

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:27.780
something that was bold we wanted to
 

00:39:27.780 --> 00:39:30.170
something that was bold we wanted to
produce a program that would have more

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:30.180
produce a program that would have more
 

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.750
produce a program that would have more
students excelling from every race than

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760
students excelling from every race than
 

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.520
students excelling from every race than
ever before excelling at the level that

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:34.530
ever before excelling at the level that

they'd want to go and get PhDs in the

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:36.180
they'd want to go and get PhDs in the
 

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.630
they'd want to go and get PhDs in the
work and if they were interested in

00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640
work and if they were interested in

that they had the gravitas to think
 

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.150
that they had the gravitas to think
about an MD PhD and so what has been

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160
about an MD PhD and so what has been
 

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:50.600
about an MD PhD and so what has been
amazing is to see our students going on

00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:50.610
amazing is to see our students going on
 

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:54.020
amazing is to see our students going on
to Harvard and Stanford to get these MD

right but it was good that we did it

right but it was good that we did it

right but it was good that we did it
because it gave us a chance to think

00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:23.370
because it gave us a chance to think

because it gave us a chance to think
about those issues and the purpose was

00:47:25.610 --> 00:47:25.620
about those issues and the purpose was
 

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.670
about those issues and the purpose was
to help more kids succeed in science and

to help more kids succeed in science and
 

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.550
to help more kids succeed in science and
engineering and we decided to use the

00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.000
to get that education is exactly what we
need we've really do it's very important

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:13.010
need we've really do it's very important
 

00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:14.710
need we've really do it's very important
that we give people otherwise how they

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720
that we give people otherwise how they

pay taxes okay your speech highlighted

00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:27.710
pay taxes okay your speech highlighted
 

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:29.829
pay taxes okay your speech highlighted
to me is a fundamental similarity

00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839
to me is a fundamental similarity
 

00:58:29.839 --> 00:58:33.280
to me is a fundamental similarity
between learning and change making

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:33.290
between learning and change making
 

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:36.880
between learning and change making
change and that is that it's really what

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:36.890
change and that is that it's really what
 

00:58:36.890 --> 00:58:40.510
change and that is that it's really what
we believe is possible in both of these

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:40.520
we believe is possible in both of these
 

00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:43.000
we believe is possible in both of these
that makes the difference so you've been

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:43.010
that makes the difference so you've been
 

00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:46.150
that makes the difference so you've been
so successful at your college what do

00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160
so successful at your college what do
 

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:47.890
so successful at your college what do
you think you can do that we could learn

00:58:47.890 --> 00:58:47.900
you think you can do that we could learn
 

00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:50.470
you think you can do that we could learn
from about changing belief yeah it's a

00:58:50.470 --> 00:58:50.480
from about changing belief yeah it's a
 

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.510
from about changing belief yeah it's a
it's such a great question and we talked

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520
it's such a great question and we talked
 

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:53.650
it's such a great question and we talked

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:05.180
you're good in math and science so
 

00:59:05.180 --> 00:59:07.930
you're good in math and science so
you're not you know and I'll ask this

you do well but most people will say

00:59:28.930 --> 00:59:28.940
you do well but most people will say
 

00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:30.040

you go into math and science well I was

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.040
you go into math and science well I was
 

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.370
you go into math and science well I was
just much better than the other area but
