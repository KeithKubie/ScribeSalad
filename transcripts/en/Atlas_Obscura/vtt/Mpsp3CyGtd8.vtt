00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.460
- 30 miles north of New York City,

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.640
there's a small town haunted by the legacy

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.899
of the Headless Horseman, 200
years after his first ride.

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.060
I'm Jessica Hester, staff
writer at Atlas Obscura,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.060
and this is how a fictional
town became reality.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.490
When Washington Irving wrote
"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.920
in 1820, the village didn't exist,

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.501
though some of its landmarks
did, like the Old Dutch Church.

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.910
He placed the story of Ichabod
Crane, the schoolteacher,

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.220
and the beheaded Hessian soldier

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.050
in North Tarrytown, where the church

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.673
had been standing for centuries.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.180
Sleepy Hollow was based on real geography,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.220
but it wasn't on the map.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.500
Readers were spellbound by Irving's tale

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.930
of the Headless Horseman,
and soon fans started

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.320
showing up in North Tarrytown.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.600
But when the town's massive
automotive factory closed

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.640
in 1996 and took
thousands of jobs with it,

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.720
the town put its future on the ballot

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.360
and voted to give itself a boost

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.033
by rebranding as Sleepy Hollow.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.030
Now, you literally can't turn a corner

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.970
without running into the Horseman.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.610
On a single block, we
saw him on street signs,

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.290
on a police officer's badge,

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620
on a permit tacked to
a tree, on a squad car,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.270
and on an ambulance that
turned right in front of it.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.490
He's even the mascot of
the local high school,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.613
where the sign says,
"Home of the Horsemen."

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.670
Fans sometimes get married in
the Sleepy Hollow cemetery,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.760
on the bridge crossing
the Pocantico River,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080
where the Horseman is
said to have vanished.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.520
This one isn't the original-

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.390
experts aren't sure exactly which one

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.570
Irving was writing about-but
it feels old and storied,

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.573
maybe because it's so mossy and damp.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.180
Washington Irving is also
buried inside the cemetery,

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.340
and is on his third gravestone.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.140
For years, fans chipped
pieces of it off as souvenirs.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.030
Halloween is big business
for the Horseman.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.240
The gas station across the
street from the cemetery

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.820
is stocked with swag:

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.340
Horseman tee shirts,
travel mugs, and key chains

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.980
are piled next to
lighters and allergy meds.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.370
The loudest example of Horseman tourism

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.410
is the Great Jack O'Lantern Blaze.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.180
It's in a nearby town,
and it runs all season.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.750
Nearly 150,000 people
wander around the grounds

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.310
of an old manor house, weaving
around 7,000 carved pumpkins.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.650
It's a giant spectacle,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.170
complete with choreographed lighting,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.610
immersive special effects,
even a creepy original score.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.690
The whole thing is very theatrical.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.050
But it's easy to get
swept up in the magic,

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.403
no matter how cynical you are.

00:02:30.403 --> 00:02:33.110
The Horseman's legacy is there, too.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.260
He's in the gift shop and out in the yard,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.540
where a soundtrack plays
a loop of clomping hooves,

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.570
a whinny, and a cackle.

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:42.770
It's not so unusual for
a town to rebrand itself,

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:45.740
but few have gone bigger
than Sleepy Hollow.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.842
Here, fact and fiction swirl together.

00:02:47.842 --> 00:02:50.270
Centuries after it was written down,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.350
the legend still draws people to the place

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.183
that inspired the story, and
has now claimed it as its own.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.480
Thanks so much for watching.
