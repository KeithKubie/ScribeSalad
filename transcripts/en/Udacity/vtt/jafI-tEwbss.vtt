00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.990
So let's just call the smooth guy A, because that's what we've

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.150
been doing all along. And he can either choose to cooperate, or

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.850
he can choose to defect. Now by the way, I'm saying cooperate

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.710
and defect here because they're terms of art, not because these are the

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.190
words I would have chosen. Okay? B can do the same thing.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.880
B can choose to cooperate or B can choose to defect. Now

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.200
I've set up the game in a particular way here. The, the,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.760
the cops have set up the game in a particular way here. If

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:33.170
B defects but A cooperates, then B gets to walk and A has to pay the price,

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.080
nine months in jail. So, I'm going to put into

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.710
this cell minus 9, 0. So, this means this

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.980
is the value of this set of strategies for A, and this is the value for B. So

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.320
the first number. In the pair is what A

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.120
gets and the second number's what B gets. Okay?

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.580
&gt;&gt; Got it.
&gt;&gt; You with me?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.870
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.246
&gt;&gt; Okay, now notice we have to do this now because it's

00:00:54.246 --> 00:00:56.638
no longer zero sum. It's not going to always add up to a constant.

00:00:56.638 --> 00:01:01.127
&gt;&gt; Oh. Well, it is, so far it's a constant negative 9.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.791
&gt;&gt; That's right, oh and in fact it looks this

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:07.040
way as well because I have a symmetric deal here.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.870
So if A defects and B cooperates, A gets to

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.720
walk and B goes to jail for nine months. Okay?

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.880
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.120
&gt;&gt; So right now, you're right, it's looking like a zero sum game,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.070
but it isn't. Because what happens if both A and B

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.990
drop a dime on each other? Well, they both confessed. So it's

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.730
a little good, it's a little bit better than having one

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.000
of them, only one of them, confess. The deal that the DA

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.911
is willing to give them is that both of them will

00:01:32.911 --> 00:01:35.780
spend six months in jail. Now these are just, these are just,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.588
the, the numbers that are a part of the game. This is,

00:01:38.588 --> 00:01:41.085
I'm not computing this from anywhere. This is just the way the,

00:01:41.085 --> 00:01:43.840
the cops have set this up. And I'm going to, now what's

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.310
an interesting question here is what happens if both A and

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.440
B keep their mouth shut? They both choose to cooperate? It

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.580
turns out that it's not a perfect world because they were

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.450
caught with a bunch of guns they didn't have permits for.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.160
So if neither one of them admits to robbing the bank,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.930
they're still going to do a little bit of time. But in

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.490
this case, it's a small weapon's charge and so each only spends

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.070
a month in jail.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.620
&gt;&gt; I see, so now it's definitely not zero sum.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.949
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.190
&gt;&gt; Because we have a negative 2 there, a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.580
negative 12 there, a negative 9 and a negative 9.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.970
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.680
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.310
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.940
&gt;&gt; So, you got the game, you understand it?

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.690
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I think so.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.070
&gt;&gt; It's very simple. Now, just looking at

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.930
this, what's the best possible outcome for the duo?

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.430
&gt;&gt; So if they cooperate with each other, then there's you know,

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.580
one month later, they're back on the streets, back to their criminal activities.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.500
&gt;&gt; Or they're reformed. You never know.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.810
&gt;&gt; Sure. Back to their choice of

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.500
whether to have criminal activities. The, the mutual

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.388
defection one, that, where they both defect,

00:02:41.388 --> 00:02:43.360
it's either, well, 12 months or six months,

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.250
depending on how you think about it, but they don't do nearly as well. And

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.340
then the defect and cooperate, it seems like

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.130
there's a lot of incarceration that will happen.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.485
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:52.485 --> 00:02:53.840
&gt;&gt; So, it feels like the best for the,

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.270
for the two of them is to mutual cooperate. Cooperate,

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.670
cooperate.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And that makes sense. This is sort

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:00.920
of what you want to happen. Both of them

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.690
keep their mouth shut. They do a little bit

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.120
of time, but on average, they do pretty well. Right?

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.670
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.450
&gt;&gt; So my question to you is, is that going to happen?

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.090
&gt;&gt; Sure, why wouldn't it happen?

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.418
&gt;&gt; Well, you tell me. If I know

00:03:13.418 --> 00:03:15.620
that you're going to cooperate. Let's say that I'm

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.890
A, okay? And you're B, and I know

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.710
that you're going to cooperate. What should I do?

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.880
&gt;&gt; You should cooperate.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.040
&gt;&gt; Should I? You've

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.240
chosen, you've chosen this column. All right?

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.690
&gt;&gt; I see. Well, if you think of it that way then it's not a joint choice,

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.870
but it's actually an individual choosing. Then you're

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.925
better off defecting because then you get off scot-free.

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:36.140
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.440
&gt;&gt; Then, but I go to jail for nine

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.780
months. I could have a whole baby in that time.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.630
&gt;&gt; Usually takes closer to ten but sure. But

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.230
you go to to jail for nine months, I don't.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.080
&gt;&gt; So if you are just that cold.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.830
I guess because you're a criminal.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.040
&gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. Remember, the matrix is everything. The

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.250
value of doing this to me is 0 versus minus 1.

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.260
&gt;&gt; Alright, that's, that's cold, man.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.670
&gt;&gt; I agree, but it's what the numbers tell

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.430
you. What if it wasn't criminal? What if it was

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.800
just, you know, the amount of money that I

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.340
was going to win in a, in a mini poker game?

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.050
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but it's a different kind of mini poker game,

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.880
because we're both, because. [LAUGH] It's like you beat me. But,

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.060
by beating me that way, you like, kill, nearly kill me.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.029
&gt;&gt; So? Are you saying that when?

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:18.050
&gt;&gt; What do you mean so?

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.190
&gt;&gt; Are you saying you always let me win whenever we play poker?

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.160
&gt;&gt; No.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.590
&gt;&gt; Okay then. Because you're cold, is that what you're saying?

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.065
&gt;&gt; No. Wait, what?

00:04:26.065 --> 00:04:28.485
&gt;&gt; Exactly, right. So the point, Michael, is that if I know

00:04:28.485 --> 00:04:30.658
you're going to cooperate, you're going to choose

00:04:30.658 --> 00:04:32.370
this column, then I should defect.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.530
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright, so, fine. So now I'm going to jail for nine months.

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.030
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, if you choose to cooperate.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.580
&gt;&gt; Aha. If, if is good. So what you're

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.358
saying is, I could drop a dime on you. [LAUGH]

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:47.840
&gt;&gt; You could. So, you could choose to defect, and if

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.870
I knew you were going to choose to defect, what would I do?

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.630
&gt;&gt; Well, you already, you already showed

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.108
your colors, man. You're, you're defecting, so

00:04:54.108 --> 00:04:57.800
I'm just switching, I'm just saving myself three months by, by ratting you out.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so we would end up here. By the way, you know that

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.320
this game is symmetric, right?

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.078
&gt;&gt; no. You defected first. [LAUGH]

00:05:10.078 --> 00:05:14.840
&gt;&gt; No, here's the thing. Since the only thing I care about is maximizing my

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.750
own reward, my own value. I'm going to do the thing that makes sense for me to

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:23.160
do in this case which is if you cooperate, defect. If you defect, defect. But

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.840
you would do the same thing because your

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.770
whole goal here is to maximize your value.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well you don't know me like that.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.710
&gt;&gt; Yes I do because it's everything that's here

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.530
in the matrix. This is the wonderful thing about

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.830
game theory. All the stuff that you're concerned about is all

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.910
inside the matrix. Remember the rules of the game don't matter. There's

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.850
no prisoners here. There are no criminals. There's just, I get a

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.835
dollar, I lose a dollar, or I lose zero dollars. I lose

00:05:44.835 --> 00:05:48.400
$9 or I lose $6. Or, for that matter, cents. I

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.640
lose one penny or I lose no pennies. I lose nine pennies

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.450
or I lose six pennies. It doesn't matter. This is the value

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:56.540
of these particular strategies. And I'm

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.540
going to want to defect if you cooperate.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.540
You'll notice if you defect, I'm also going to want to defect.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.860
In fact, if you look closely at this matrix, you

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.750
should notice something, Michael. From A's point of view, when

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.160
does it make sense for me to cooperate versus defect?

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.430
&gt;&gt; You mean if you have a, some

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.260
kind of probabilistic policy over cooperate and defect?

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.090
&gt;&gt; No, no, not even that. Just in general, is there ever a

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:21.590
time as A that I would rather cooperate than defect or vice versa?

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.551
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see. So if I know you're going to

00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:27.615
cooperate, I should defect to, to save myself a month. But if I know you're

00:06:27.615 --> 00:06:30.000
going to defect, I should defect to save myself

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.640
three months. Either way, I'm coming out ahead.

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.840
&gt;&gt; Right. So in fact, let's take a look at this.
