00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.829
Given that humans have been using lead in
various product for over 8,000 years (with

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:21.500
the first known mining of it in Anatolia around
6500 BCE), you might be surprised to learn

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.800
that we have known that lead is dangerous
and shouldn’t be trifled with since at least

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.699
150 BC, when its effects on the human body
were noted by famed Greek physician Nicander

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:31.699
of Colophon.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.010
Nicander even went so far as to describe the
metal as “deadly”, writing extensively

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.170
on the crippling effects it has on the human
body in his work, Alexipharmaca.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.530
Further, Greek physician Pedanius Dioscorides
noted in the first century AD: “Lead makes

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:55.860
the mind give way”.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.860
To quote the Occupation Safety and Health
Research Institute: “Lead poisoning is one

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.930
of the earliest identified and most known
occupational disease.

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.810
Its acute effects have been recognized from
antiquity.”

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.570
So what exactly does lead poisoning do to
the body?

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.390
Well, depending on how much of the substance
gets into your body (and it doesn’t take

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.290
much, particularly for children), it can cause
everything from constipation to permanent

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.970
reduction in your IQ and mental capacity.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.430
It also can potentially fundamentally change
a given person’s personality, causing them

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.000
to be irritable and suffer from erratic mood-swings
and fatigue without warning; cause a reduction

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.979
in sperm count and infertility; stunted growth
(in children); miscarriages; and a whole slew

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.869
of other terrifying symptoms.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.100
So that’s what it can do, but how?

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.380
Why is lead so dangerous to the human body
while we can safely ingest many other types

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.360
of metals, like iron, without worry (and,
in fact, need some of them to survive)?

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.740
While research is ongoing into the full effects
and mechanisms involved in lead poisoning,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.100
what we do know is that a lot of the damage
is due to the fact that important things like

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.880
zinc, calcium, and iron in the body can ultimately
get replaced by lead in many key biochemical

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.880
reactions, if lead is present.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.179
Unlike these other metals, though, while lead
is happy to bind and interact with various

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.920
critical enzymes, the result isn’t the normal
reaction you need.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.510
For example, with calcium, as noted in this
paper on the Mechanisms of Lead Neurotoxicity,

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.980
lead has a nasty habit of being able to mimic,
or in some cases straight up inhibit the actions

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.390
of calcium in natural biological reactions
that take place within the human body, inhibiting

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.010
neurological function, among other things.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.200
Lead also can damage DNA, as well as your
cell membranes, the latter of which, combined

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.200
with the fact that it also interferes with
heme synthesis, can result in anemia among

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.440
a host of other problems.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.629
It can interfere with the ability for your
body to synthesize vitamin D, which comes

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.170
with yet another host of its own problems
if you don’t have enough.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.960
It also causes a few different problems with
your immune system; interferes with metabolism

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.410
of bones and teeth; can cause abnormal calcium
build up within cells… the list goes on

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.410
and on and on.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.080
If that wasn’t bad enough, lead can easily
find its way into almost any part of your

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:11.769
body once introduced, whether by breathing
it in, ingesting it, or (very rarely) via

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:12.800
skin absorption.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.040
From this, you might find it completely unsurprising
that, unlike many other poisons, according

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.470
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
lead is so toxic to humans that, “No safe

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.819
blood lead level has been identified.”

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.690
So, in short, lead is bad for you because,
though lead has no useful function in your

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:34.659
body, it’s happy to jump on in and give
it its best college try, interacting up a

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.959
storm with various enzymes, failing the whole
way at producing the reactions that are needed

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.390
for normal body function.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.209
But what it lacks in end result, it makes
up for in staying power.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:49.549
You see, the half-life of lead in the body
is quite long- weeks in your blood, months

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:57.650
in your soft tissues, and years in your bones;
and by years we mean up to two to three decades.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:12.989
Who needs proper enzymatic function anyway?
