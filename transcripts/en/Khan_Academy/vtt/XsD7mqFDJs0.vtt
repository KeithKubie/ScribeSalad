00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:04.007
Male: In our earlier justifications
for an upward sloping

00:00:04.007 --> 00:00:06.404
aggregate supply curve in the short run,

00:00:06.404 --> 00:00:08.735
we kind of viewed price as
the independent variable.

00:00:08.735 --> 00:00:10.339
What I want to explore a
little bit in this video

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.791
is that you could view
it the other way around.

00:00:11.791 --> 00:00:15.605
You could view that real
GDP is driving price.

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:19.196
Just to review, this
is our upward sloping,

00:00:19.196 --> 00:00:20.996
the thing that we want to happen.

00:00:20.996 --> 00:00:23.945
Aggregate supply in the short run.

00:00:23.945 --> 00:00:25.654
In the previous videos we said, hey,

00:00:25.654 --> 00:00:29.726
when price increases,
this would cause real GDP

00:00:29.726 --> 00:00:32.273
to maybe expand even beyond its potential,

00:00:32.273 --> 00:00:34.125
beyond its natural rate.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.457
Let's say that this is
where it is in the long run,

00:00:36.457 --> 00:00:37.457
right over here.

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:38.691
Let me draw it.

00:00:38.691 --> 00:00:39.991
This is where it is in the long run,

00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.795
right over here.

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:43.280
This is an aggregate
supply in the long run.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.458
This is the current level of prices.

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:46.654
This is all review.

00:00:46.654 --> 00:00:48.858
Right over here, this is
our current level of prices.

00:00:48.858 --> 00:00:50.727
This is where we're sitting on GDP.

00:00:50.727 --> 00:00:55.914
In the past we said, hey,
if we increase prices

00:00:55.914 --> 00:00:59.958
because of a bunch of
factors, that might cause,

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.254
in aggregate, the economy to produce even

00:01:02.254 --> 00:01:06.336
above its natural rate,
so you would actually have

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:08.666
real GDP expanding, so you have

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.336
an upward sloping aggregate supply curve.

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:14.264
We gave reasons why price
might drive this to happen.

00:01:14.264 --> 00:01:16.261
We talked about the misperception theory,

00:01:16.261 --> 00:01:18.995
that individual actors in the economy,

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:20.732
individual firms, might misperceive

00:01:20.732 --> 00:01:23.928
the increases in prices as a microeconomic

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:25.664
phenomenon and so they would,

00:01:25.664 --> 00:01:27.061
because of the law of supply,

00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:29.197
they'd think they were
making more real profit.

00:01:29.197 --> 00:01:31.328
It would take them some time
to realize that they aren't.

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:33.667
It's just nominal profits
that they're getting.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.062
On top of that, we talked about the whole

00:01:36.062 --> 00:01:37.644
sticky wage, sticky cost theory,

00:01:37.644 --> 00:01:40.928
that some part of the
economy there will be

00:01:40.928 --> 00:01:44.059
increased real profits
because in the short term,

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:46.276
some players' costs aren't going to go up

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:47.857
as much as their revenue are,

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:49.393
so they would also want to essentially

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:52.474
produce more beyond their
natural productivity

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:54.471
and maybe overheat their factories

00:01:54.471 --> 00:01:55.977
and their people a little bit.

00:01:55.977 --> 00:01:57.646
But I want to talk in this video,

00:01:57.646 --> 00:01:59.727
and this is true of a
lot of economic models,

00:01:59.727 --> 00:02:01.999
you don't have to view
price as driving real GDP.

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.861
You could really just view
it the other way around.

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:09.469
As real GDP, if you get
utilization really, really high,

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:10.552
approaching 100%,

00:02:10.552 --> 00:02:11.993
and depending on how
you define utilization,

00:02:11.993 --> 00:02:13.331
maybe going even above 100%,

00:02:13.331 --> 00:02:15.529
that that might actually drive prices,

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.070
or that maybe they are driving each other.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.337
One way to think of it, and really this is

00:02:21.337 --> 00:02:23.273
just another justification
for an upward sloping

00:02:23.273 --> 00:02:24.894
aggregate supply curve,

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:26.332
but we're just doing it a different way.

00:02:26.332 --> 00:02:28.477
Now we're saying this is our
natural rate of productivity.

00:02:28.477 --> 00:02:31.674
If we're asking people to produce more,

00:02:31.674 --> 00:02:33.401
then they're going to want to charge more.

00:02:33.401 --> 00:02:36.400
The way to think about
this, and at the end

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.471
it's really not going to help them

00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:40.198
because everything's going
to get more expensive.

00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:42.469
They're going to produce more
but they're not going to,

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:46.118
on a per unit basis, not
get much more real profit.

00:02:46.118 --> 00:02:47.695
But in the short run they might,

00:02:47.695 --> 00:02:49.122
or they might think they are,

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:50.193
so they might want to do it.

00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:51.945
The one way to think about this is

00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:55.121
if you view this bar,
the area of this bar,

00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:58.989
as the capacity of a firm,
the capacity of a market,

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.723
capacity of an entire economy,

00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:02.942
then maybe its natural, its potential,

00:03:02.942 --> 00:03:06.249
maybe it's sitting here
at maybe 85% utilization.

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.529
If the factory could be
producing widgets or cars

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.385
or whatever 100 hours a week, its natural

00:03:14.385 --> 00:03:16.053
state is it's actually only producing

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:18.191
85 hours a week and
that's because it needs

00:03:18.191 --> 00:03:20.353
to use that other 15
hours to let the factory

00:03:20.353 --> 00:03:22.605
cool down, or to do
repairs and maintenance

00:03:22.605 --> 00:03:24.451
or inspections of some sort.

00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:26.404
But let's say that for whatever reason,

00:03:26.404 --> 00:03:27.786
maybe a war starts, and the government

00:03:27.786 --> 00:03:29.604
demands that more things get built,

00:03:29.604 --> 00:03:31.254
more widgets get built,
more tanks get built,

00:03:31.254 --> 00:03:34.531
more materials need to be developed,

00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:37.055
that they're essentially
asking people not to do

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:38.654
some of these things that
they would have to do

00:03:38.654 --> 00:03:40.357
if they want to be
sustainable in the long run,

00:03:40.357 --> 00:03:42.652
and they ask the
factories to produce more,

00:03:42.652 --> 00:03:47.122
to start getting to 90%, 95%,
maybe even 100% utilization.

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:49.719
You can imagine in this situation all of

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.532
the firms ... a firm
is all about maximizing

00:03:53.532 --> 00:03:56.194
profit ... they will
raise prices when they

00:03:56.194 --> 00:03:58.461
can raise prices even
though in the long run

00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:00.656
it will just be a nominal increase.

00:04:00.656 --> 00:04:02.118
It won't necessarily be a real increase,

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:03.659
but they'll feel in the
short run that it is

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.991
kind of a real increase in prices,

00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.529
and so they will do that.

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:11.719
Instead of them trying
to build more capacity,

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:13.454
they might even view it
as a short run thing,

00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:15.529
so they'll say, hey,
no, you're going to have

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:17.279
to pay us a lot of money for our employees

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.853
to work overtime.

00:04:18.853 --> 00:04:20.609
Maybe that's even in some of the contracts

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.020
that you have to pay more
for them to work overtime,

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.789
for me to defer some of my maintenance

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.724
and other things that I
was going to going to do,

00:04:27.724 --> 00:04:30.252
or kind of defer investment for me to just

00:04:30.252 --> 00:04:32.854
produce all out right over here.

00:04:32.854 --> 00:04:36.194
I'm just describing the
same upward sloping curve

00:04:36.194 --> 00:04:37.450
but with a different narrative.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.141
Instead of saying that price
is driving real GDP expansion

00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:43.294
because of the misperception
theory and sticky prices,

00:04:43.294 --> 00:04:46.722
I'm saying that an increase in real GDP

00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:49.594
and an increase in
utilization will drive prices.

00:04:49.594 --> 00:04:51.654
They're just two ways to
look at the same thing.

00:04:51.654 --> 00:04:53.698
You can even apply that
to some of the ideas

00:04:53.698 --> 00:04:55.253
that we talked about in the last video.

00:04:55.253 --> 00:04:57.534
In the last video, you might
not have even had to resort

00:04:57.534 --> 00:05:00.383
to the Aggregate Demand
Aggregate Supply model.

00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.273
You might not even need

00:05:02.273 --> 00:05:04.875
Aggregate Demand Aggregate
Supply to understand

00:05:04.875 --> 00:05:08.363
why we had inflation in 1966 and 1967

00:05:08.363 --> 00:05:10.858
and really the late '60s generally.

00:05:10.858 --> 00:05:12.718
All you would have to do is think about

00:05:12.718 --> 00:05:15.665
entering into, or the beginning of LBJ's

00:05:15.665 --> 00:05:17.530
administration, the economy was already

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.855
at high utilization.

00:05:18.855 --> 00:05:21.917
Unemployment was only at around 4% or 5%;

00:05:21.917 --> 00:05:26.271
95%-96% of the labor force was employed.

00:05:26.271 --> 00:05:28.316
Factories were operating
at high utilization.

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:30.318
Now we escalate the war.

00:05:30.318 --> 00:05:32.858
We're taking people who could have been

00:05:32.858 --> 00:05:34.784
employed in the domestic economy

00:05:34.784 --> 00:05:36.528
and they're going and fighting in battle.

00:05:36.528 --> 00:05:38.054
We need bullets, we need boats,

00:05:38.054 --> 00:05:39.831
we need fuel, we need all of these things.

00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:42.271
We need to utilize more
of domestic capacity

00:05:42.271 --> 00:05:44.441
to produce all of these things, so you can

00:05:44.441 --> 00:05:46.959
imagine that this dynamic was occurring;

00:05:46.959 --> 00:05:50.455
that you had to get firms
and people to tap out

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:53.191
all of their extra
capacity, and then to do so

00:05:53.191 --> 00:05:54.665
they're essentially going to demand

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:57.117
higher wages and higher prices.

00:05:57.117 --> 00:05:59.280
We wouldn't have necessarily
even had to resort

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.734
to this to predict this higher inflation.

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:03.939
Another way to think about
it is this is another

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.895
way to justify an upward sloping

00:06:05.895 --> 00:06:07.734
aggregate supply curve in the short run,

00:06:07.734 --> 00:06:11.064
which is another way that we
described the same dynamic.

00:06:11.064 --> 00:06:14.067
They're all heavily, heavily related.
