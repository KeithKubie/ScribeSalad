- My story is about
a time in my life

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:15.841

00:01:21.814 --> 00:01:24.651
So the story starts

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:26.952
at Iowa State University,

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.254
where I went to follow my one

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.356
true passion in life,
advertising.

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:35.094
So I show up as a fresh-faced
teen just being like,

00:01:35.094 --> 00:01:37.596
I'm gonna make commercials.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.965
I hated everybody.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.766
I did not fit in at all.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:43.202
They made me live in
an agriculture dorm,

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:45.004
so it was just, like,
all these girls

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:46.839
who had pictures
of their farm animals

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:48.607
that were their friends,
that they, like,

00:01:48.607 --> 00:01:51.977
won contests with and then ate
later in the evening,

00:01:51.977 --> 00:01:55.147
um, at a restaurant
called the Machine Shed.

00:01:55.147 --> 00:01:57.883
So, uh, I didn't
get along with them.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.385
And then...

00:01:59.385 --> 00:02:01.187
I just didn't connect
with anybody.

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:03.822
Like, on my 18th birthday
in college, I had no friends,

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:05.525
so I just went and got
my nipples pierced,

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.526
'cause I thought, like,
this is a way to, like,

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:10.363
commemorate the time,
but, like, that--

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.231
that is how lonely I was,
that I just

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:14.701
went alone, and was just like,
yeah, pierce 'em, dude.

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:16.168
And then I tried
to fuck that guy.

00:02:16.168 --> 00:02:17.703
It didn't work out.
He liked Jesus.

00:02:17.703 --> 00:02:19.705
Um...but I tried.

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:21.207
He, like, looked kind of tough.

00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:24.043
And, so, I was lonely.
I didn't have friends.

00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:26.546
Like, my number-one hobby
became racquetball.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:28.882
And...[laughs], like,
I don't want to do that.

00:02:28.882 --> 00:02:31.384
Um, I'm like
a 50-year-old Asian.

00:02:31.384 --> 00:02:33.886
And, um...

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:35.855
I was the treasurer
of the Jew club--

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.223
like, nothing was really
happening.

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:40.259
Like, I couldn't find a friend.

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.827
I couldn't find a passion.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:44.763
And so I just, like, started
drinking a lot.

00:02:44.763 --> 00:02:47.033
And obviously, that's what
everyone does in college,

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.234
but--yeah, I just got
blacked-out constantly,

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:51.704
all the time,
and then this one night,

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:54.673
my friend, uh, she was having
some friends over.

00:02:54.673 --> 00:02:57.343
I remember hooking up with
someone in her bed,

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.412
and then I had
a bump on my head,

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:01.113
but I don't remember how,
and then I just

00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:02.748
took a nap on the couch.

00:03:02.748 --> 00:03:05.584
And my friends all knew that I
loved drinking and driving,

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:08.922
so they hid my car keys,
so I went--I know.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:10.589
People are, like, really
anti-drinking and driving,

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.226
but this was, like, ten years
ago, so...

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:14.527
[laughter]

00:03:14.527 --> 00:03:15.695
You all got silent.

00:03:15.695 --> 00:03:17.763
Who has DUIs here?
How many of you?

00:03:17.763 --> 00:03:18.765
- Yee.
- Whoo.

00:03:18.765 --> 00:03:20.233
- Yeah, okay. Um...

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:21.568
[laughter]

00:03:21.568 --> 00:03:23.702
Hey, guys. Um...

00:03:23.702 --> 00:03:25.638
But yeah, it was just, like,
a fun thing to do,

00:03:25.638 --> 00:03:29.241
so, like, I rummaged around,
I found the keys,

00:03:29.241 --> 00:03:30.776
and I went drinking and driving.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:34.047
And--
but, I was driving to my house,

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:35.915
and then I was like,

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:37.983
I could--I was just
right by my house,

00:03:37.983 --> 00:03:39.551
and then I was like,
I want Burger King.

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.787
So I kept driving.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:44.123
And two blocks from my house,

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.425
I get pulled over,
and I just act like

00:03:46.425 --> 00:03:48.161
the dumb white bitch I am, and
I'm just like,

00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:50.296
I know my rights.
I have a lawyer.

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.298
Like, calling my dad and being
like, I'm not drunk,

00:03:53.298 --> 00:03:55.801
but, like--yeah, it's a problem.

00:03:55.801 --> 00:03:58.170
So they take me to jail.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.439
They put me in the drunk tank,
which I'm kind of into,

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:03.242
'cause I love the aquarium, and
I felt like I was in one,

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.911
so I was, like, okay with it.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:08.347
And I did feel
really bad about myself.

00:04:08.347 --> 00:04:09.948
Drunk driving sucks.
You can kill--

00:04:09.948 --> 00:04:11.617
like, it was really an
embarrassing,

00:04:11.617 --> 00:04:14.186
sad time in my life, and I was
like, things need to change.

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:16.155
I need to become
a better person.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:18.825
So I went to A.A., and then I
was like, oh, I'm better

00:04:18.825 --> 00:04:20.626
than everyone here, so...

00:04:20.626 --> 00:04:22.127
[laughter]

00:04:22.127 --> 00:04:25.498
So I never went back to A.A.

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:27.200
But, you know,
I was, like, "Depressed."

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.769
And, you know, just, like,
really introspective.

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:31.437
I probably read
some books or two.

00:04:31.437 --> 00:04:33.338
And I was really
trying hard to be sober

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:34.974
and not be, like, a wild gal,

00:04:34.974 --> 00:04:37.042
and my friend Shannon
at the time,

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:39.278
she had a lot of problems too.

00:04:39.278 --> 00:04:41.179
She was trying to be sober--
now we all know

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:42.648
it's because she is a lesbian,

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:44.550
and she was, like,
hiding her true self.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.018
You know what I mean?
So, like--

00:04:46.018 --> 00:04:47.219
but we all should have known.

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:48.821
She had this ponytail
that was, like,

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:51.657
gelled really tight, like,
right in the middle of the head.

00:04:51.657 --> 00:04:52.991
You know?

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:56.562
Like, no casual girl
loves soccer that much.

00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:59.866
So, we should have known, but,

00:04:59.866 --> 00:05:01.367
so she was having
weird problems,

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:02.868
like, figuring herself out.

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.404
I, obviously, was not
in the right place in life,

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:06.973
but wasn't mature enough
to be like,

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.173
I need to get out of here.

00:05:08.173 --> 00:05:09.542
And she called me one day--

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:11.677
this was three weeks after the
first arrest--

00:05:11.677 --> 00:05:15.214
and she went, "Hey, do you want
to have a sober night out,

00:05:15.214 --> 00:05:17.250
and we'll go
to the gymnastics meet?"

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.017
We had an amazing
gymnastics team,

00:05:19.017 --> 00:05:20.385
and I was like, "Absolutely."

00:05:20.385 --> 00:05:23.756
So we--I went to her dorm room,

00:05:23.756 --> 00:05:25.992
and before we went to the
gymnastics meet, she went,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:27.259
"I mean, we should
have one drink."

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:30.730
I was like, yes, yes.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:34.733
So, the next thing I know, the
bottle of Parrot Bay is gone,

00:05:34.733 --> 00:05:37.936
and I'm not sure what kind
of liquor it is,

00:05:37.936 --> 00:05:39.905
but it's clear, and there's
a fun bird on it.

00:05:39.905 --> 00:05:42.207
We drank it, and--

00:05:42.207 --> 00:05:44.410
and then I just remember us
just wanting more,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:45.744
and so, like, we're walking

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:47.279
through the girls'
side of the dorm,

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.115
just, like, getting as much
booze as we can.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.617
And then I remember my crush
on this Woodsy boy.

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.552
Like, he lived
in the dorm as well.

00:05:53.552 --> 00:05:55.621
So I was like,
we got to visit Woodsy.

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.757
And so, we, um--

00:05:57.757 --> 00:06:00.359
so, we go to his dorm,
and this is the thing:

00:06:00.359 --> 00:06:02.728
like, I was pretty drunk,
so I don't remember

00:06:02.728 --> 00:06:04.564
the exact details,
but I just remember

00:06:04.564 --> 00:06:06.465
everyone's face
of disappointment.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:09.435
Like, nobody wanted us there.

00:06:09.435 --> 00:06:11.137
And we were just like,
you know,

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:12.438
just classic drunk girls.

00:06:12.438 --> 00:06:14.740
A lot of leaning
and complimenting.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.609
And then...

00:06:17.609 --> 00:06:19.312
Next thing I know,

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:20.813
Shannon is bleeding.

00:06:20.813 --> 00:06:23.983
Full-on, all the way,
all--both her wrists.

00:06:23.983 --> 00:06:25.818
Just blood everywhere.

00:06:25.818 --> 00:06:27.586
And because I knew she was
depressed, I'm like,

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.288
clearly, she's trying
to kill herself.

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:33.325
So I start running up and down
the dorms just like,

00:06:33.325 --> 00:06:35.428
Shannon's trying
to kill herself.

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:37.129
Call 911.

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.798
She's committing suicide.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:41.433
Call the police.

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:42.802
But she wasn't trying
to kill herself.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.737
She was just having a good time
punching through

00:06:44.737 --> 00:06:48.007
the fire extinguisher glass, so,
like, my bad.

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:49.808
Um...

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:51.911
Just a goof, you know.

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:53.679
[laughter]

00:06:53.679 --> 00:06:55.814
So we get back to the dorms,
we clean her off,

00:06:55.814 --> 00:06:57.750
she's laying, life goes on.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.685
A knock on the door, I open it,
it's the cops,

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:01.787
and I'm like,
oh, no, thank you.

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.422
[laughter]

00:07:03.422 --> 00:07:06.158
No.

00:07:06.158 --> 00:07:08.527
So I just closed the door in
their face, but it's, like,

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:12.765
flimsy dorm doors, so they're
able to come in easily,

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:16.135
and I just start shoving
these--I'm just like,

00:07:16.135 --> 00:07:17.603
no, thank you, you know?

00:07:17.603 --> 00:07:20.840
Just like, nope, no, just
as--all my might.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.141
You're like, "Yeah, thank
goodness you're white.

00:07:23.141 --> 00:07:24.276
You know, who would not
be here today."

00:07:24.276 --> 00:07:25.611
And I feel the same way.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:28.681
And so I'm just
shoving these guys.

00:07:28.681 --> 00:07:30.516
I'm elbowing them.
They finally, like,

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:33.352
get me into the hallway and go
into the dorm to help Shannon.

00:07:33.352 --> 00:07:35.154
And I just start screaming.

00:07:35.154 --> 00:07:37.990
Kick 'em.
Kick 'em. Kick 'em.

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.992
So she's kicking these cops.

00:07:39.992 --> 00:07:41.693
[laughter]

00:07:41.693 --> 00:07:44.630
And I'm screaming in the
hallway, and I'm sure the cops

00:07:44.630 --> 00:07:46.499
were like,
we're trying to help a girl

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.067
trying to kill herself,
you know?

00:07:48.067 --> 00:07:49.868
Like, what is happ--like,
I'm sure they're like,

00:07:49.868 --> 00:07:52.571
"Oh, we're doing the Lord's
work" or whatever.

00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:54.506
Someone's trying to
kill themselves, and these

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:57.877
bitches are just yelling,
kicking, and shoving them.

00:07:57.877 --> 00:08:00.212
So the cops are actually very,
very nice to me,

00:08:00.212 --> 00:08:03.182
and they're like, "Hey, we know
you're having a wild night.

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:04.850
"It's fine.
Just call a friend

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.219
"if you have any sober friends
to pick you up.

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:08.754
You don't have to go to jail."

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.689
But it's the middle of Iowa
on a weekend.

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:12.558
No one's fucking sober, okay?

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.827
Like, what are you talk--there's
horses on the campus.

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:17.529
We're bored, okay?
There' nothing to do.

00:08:17.529 --> 00:08:20.833
So none of my friends were
sober, so I had to go to jail.

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.068
And as soon as I figure
that out, I just--

00:08:23.068 --> 00:08:24.837
instead of being like,
oh, please, please, please,

00:08:24.837 --> 00:08:28.073
I went, if you were smart,
you'd be a detective.

00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:30.576
Um...

00:08:30.576 --> 00:08:34.013
You should've gone to college,
you hillbilly trash.

00:08:34.013 --> 00:08:35.281
You just couldn't, like,

00:08:35.281 --> 00:08:38.284
graduate from high school,
you losers.

00:08:38.284 --> 00:08:39.885
So they handcuff me
pretty tight,

00:08:39.885 --> 00:08:42.421
and then to really, like,
stick it to them,

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:44.723
I went limp, and, um,

00:08:44.723 --> 00:08:47.592
they had to drag me
into the police car.

00:08:47.592 --> 00:08:50.362
And they took Shannon
off to the hospital.

00:08:50.362 --> 00:08:52.364
And I got--
I'm in jail again,

00:08:52.364 --> 00:08:54.133
and then I wake up
in the middle of the night.

00:08:54.133 --> 00:08:56.635
Shannon is in jail.

00:08:56.635 --> 00:08:59.037
So...

00:08:59.037 --> 00:09:01.741
Shannon, why are you in jail?

00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.978
Um, she was throwing bedpans
at people at the hospital.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:09.581
So, now we're both in jail.

00:09:09.581 --> 00:09:12.785
My sister, you know, back home
in Skokie,

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.620
finds out about this--
you know, I call her.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:19.391
Her and her husband drive ten
hours in a blizzard to Iowa

00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:21.561
to bail me out of jail, and
they're like,

00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:23.729
"You clearly don't know how to
live on your own,

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:26.765
so you're dropping--we're taking
you home."

00:09:26.765 --> 00:09:28.900
And then they got me a Big Mac,
so full circle.

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.770
I finally got my cheeseburger
at the end, you know?

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.305
Um...

00:09:33.305 --> 00:09:35.473
But, uh, so we go back home,

00:09:35.473 --> 00:09:37.142
and then I followed my next true

00:09:37.142 --> 00:09:39.144
passion in life: data entry.

00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:42.147
And...

00:09:42.147 --> 00:09:44.316
[sighs]
It was so depressing.

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:46.284
Um, so I was working
in data entry,

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:47.986
and I got a really bad haircut
with layers,

00:09:47.986 --> 00:09:49.989
with blonde hair,
and they over-texturized it,

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:51.690
so that's upsetting.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:53.825
And then I was living at my
parents' house

00:09:53.825 --> 00:09:57.162
and just so sad, so I just,
like, I didn't learn my ways.

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:58.864
I just kept drinking so much,

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.999
and I just kept being
a menace to society.

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:05.203
And then it was the White Sox's
home opener.

00:10:05.203 --> 00:10:08.340
And this is the year after
they won the World Series,

00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:10.643
so this was an exciting day.

00:10:10.643 --> 00:10:12.043
And when they went
to the World Series, I got

00:10:12.043 --> 00:10:14.212
acrylic black nails that said
"White Sox"

00:10:14.212 --> 00:10:16.182
in white letters
with diamonds on 'em,

00:10:16.182 --> 00:10:17.983
so, like, you can imagine.

00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.518
And so--so we are pumped.

00:10:20.518 --> 00:10:22.287
It's my friend's 21st birthday.

00:10:22.287 --> 00:10:24.022
We are going
to the White Sox game.

00:10:24.022 --> 00:10:27.325
This is a whole new life--we're
back in Chicago, you know?

00:10:27.325 --> 00:10:29.962
And I got arrested third inning.

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:32.631
I know you're all...

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:33.866
You're all wondering, "Oh, my
God.

00:10:33.866 --> 00:10:36.035
What did you do to get
arrested?"

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:39.137
I don't know.

00:10:39.137 --> 00:10:40.705
No idea--
all I remember

00:10:40.705 --> 00:10:43.642
is the same faces
of disappointment

00:10:43.642 --> 00:10:46.679
as the party and the dorm room,
and just like, everywhere.

00:10:46.679 --> 00:10:50.549
And so as I came to from my
blackout, they let me out

00:10:50.549 --> 00:10:52.717
on my own recognizance--

00:10:52.717 --> 00:10:55.921
which...[sighs], no--
I was so drunk.

00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:58.556
And all I could remember was my
friend's address,

00:10:58.556 --> 00:11:00.325
and she lived at 420 [bleep].

00:11:00.325 --> 00:11:03.696
I got in the cab, and I went,
take me to 420 [bleep], sir.

00:11:03.696 --> 00:11:06.832
And so we went to 420 [bleep],
and--oh, I'm sorry.

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:08.567
This is so embarrassing.
I didn't pay him, okay?

00:11:08.567 --> 00:11:10.736
I just ran away,
and so...

00:11:10.736 --> 00:11:14.407
I--I was, like, grappling
whether to be honest or not,

00:11:14.407 --> 00:11:19.210
but we're here, so I didn't--
I ran away, and--

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:21.346
and I get to my friend's house,

00:11:21.346 --> 00:11:22.714
and they whole time I'm
thinking, like,

00:11:22.714 --> 00:11:24.516
oh, I'm gonna get so much
sympathy.

00:11:24.516 --> 00:11:26.585
Oh, I'm so sad.
I keep getting arrested.

00:11:26.585 --> 00:11:29.221
Poor me.
I'm a--mrr--menace, you know?

00:11:29.221 --> 00:11:32.424
And she's midway through an
abortion pill, so--

00:11:32.424 --> 00:11:35.761
yeah, gasps, um, but...

00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:38.564
Some of you don't know--you can
have at-home abortions.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:42.968
So, she's midway through
an abortion, and, um,

00:11:42.968 --> 00:11:44.970
so then I had to give her
attention.

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:47.773
What a cunt. Um...

00:11:47.773 --> 00:11:50.275
Ugh.

00:11:50.275 --> 00:11:53.212
So annoying.

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:55.781
But, you know, and I haven't
been to jail since,

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:57.316
so it's been 11 years.

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:58.717
Thank you.

00:11:58.717 --> 00:12:03.455
Yeah, and I guess the lesson of
this truly is,

00:12:03.455 --> 00:12:06.792
no matter how bad life gets,
just know that someone's at home

00:12:06.792 --> 00:12:09.794
in the middle of an abortion, so
it could be worse.

00:12:09.794 --> 00:12:12.130
All right, thanks so much,
you guys.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:13.099
