00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.630
Good morning.

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.980
We are now on page 582.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.065
We're going to start
test number four.

00:00:06.065 --> 00:00:10.150
So let's start with the first
problem, problem number one.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.520
When Miss Jung arrived at the
grocery store, there were five

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.280
packages of hot dog rolls
left on the shelf.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.860
One package contained 12 rolls,
and each of the other

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.600
packages contained 8 rolls.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.250
So there's five packages, one
contained 12 rolls, and then

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.010
the other four contained
8 rolls, right?

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.930
Because there was 5 total.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.950
If Miss Jung bought all five
packages, how many hot dog

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.900
rolls did she purchase
at the store?

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.060
So it's 12 rolls from that
one, plus 4 times 8.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.000
Well that's 32.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.630
So 2 plus 2 is 4, and then 44.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.120
So she bought 44 rolls,
and that's choice C.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.090
The hardest part there is
just the multiplication.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.480
Number two, A, B, and
C are points on a

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.630
line in that order.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.180
OK, let's draw that.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.445
So there's my line.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:24.770
OK, so A, B, and C are points
on a line: A, B, and C.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.340
If A, B equals 30, and B,
C is 20 more than A,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.815
B-- so B, C is what?

00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:38.300
It's 20 more than this,
so it's 50, right--

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.460
what does A, C equal?

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.710
So what does this equal?

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.286
Well it's just 30 plus
50, it's 80.

00:01:44.286 --> 00:01:46.780
And that is choice D.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.030
Next question.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.950
And I will change colors.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.580
Problem number three.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.840
If x plus 3 is equal
to a, then what

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.890
does 2x plus 6 equal?

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.430
So the really fast way of doing
this is you just say

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.240
well, you know what?

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.760
2x plus 6, that's the
same thing as 2

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.090
times x plus 3, right?

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.460
And what's 2 times x plus 3?

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.170
Well x plus 3 is a, so this is
going to equal 2 times a.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.745
And that's choice C.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:27.630
And that's the fast
way to do it.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.950
I mean, you could've done x is
equal to a minus 3, and then

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.180
substituted this in here, and
said 2 times a minus 3 plus 6.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.710
You get 2a minus 6 plus 6, and
you would have gotten 2a.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:44.180
This would have taken you
like 15 extra precious

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.140
seconds on the SAT.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.690
So if you saw this, immediately,
this would have

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:47.520
been a better way to do it.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.950
But this would have also
been a correct way.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.870
The next question looks like--
well the next couple of

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.490
questions I'll have to do
some drawing for it.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:00.080
OK, so they plot a bunch
of points out.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.180
I'm trying to figure out how
I can draw the minimum.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.510
I don't have to draw
the whole thing.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.370
So that's the y-axis, x-axis.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.640
Let's see, scores on tests.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.122
I'm just going to draw the
points that look like-- so I

00:03:15.122 --> 00:03:16.170
don't have to draw
the whole thing.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:23.675
So you have points A, you
have point B here.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.490
You have point C.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.500
And then they have
point D here.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.380
And then they have an E, which
it looks like it's the same

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.390
level as the B, point E.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.600
And so we get where we are.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.110
So this line right here,
that's a 60.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.100
And then they draw another
line right here.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:58.320
And then this point
right here is 80.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.580
That's 80, then this line down
here looks like roughly--

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.795
let's see, it's 40.

00:04:04.795 --> 00:04:07.105
And where the C is, looks like
there's a line here.

00:04:07.105 --> 00:04:11.881
Then the C is, there's a
60, then a line, and

00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:15.010
there is a 80 there.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.750
And in the book it says
the x-axis is the

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.000
score on test one.

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.370
And then the y-axis is test two,
the score on test two.

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.350
I know you can't read what I
wrote, but you can look at it

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.910
in your book.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:29.910
Score on test two, so
these are the test

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:30.910
scores of five students.

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.140
So problem number four asks us,
for which student was the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.360
change in scores, from test one
to test two, the greatest?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.170
So which student either did
really bad on test one and

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.430
then improved to test two, or
did really good on test one,

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.220
and then kind of degraded?

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:50.780
Well let's see.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.920
Let's get the chart.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:57.305
So student B scored a 40
on test-- let's do

00:04:57.305 --> 00:04:58.500
it actually in order.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.180
So what was the change for A?

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.010
These aren't the choices, these
are just-- actually the

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.470
choices are the same
as the letters.

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.420
So A got a 40 on test
one, right?

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.140
Got a 40 on test one-- just
read it here-- and got

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:14.490
a 70 on test two.

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.210
So the change is 30.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.895
B got a 40 on test one,
and a 60 on test two.

00:05:22.895 --> 00:05:25.560
So the change is 20.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.980
C got a 60 and a
70, that's 10.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.180
D got an 80 and an 80, so
it's no difference.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.680
And then E got an 80 and
a 60, or minus 20.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.110
But the change is
still just 20.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.490
We could write minus 20.

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.250
But the biggest change is
choice A: got a 40,

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.110
and then got a 70.

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.375
So really improved on
that second test.

00:05:47.375 --> 00:05:49.940
And number five.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.910
What was the average-- the
arithmetic mean-- of the

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.520
scores of the five students
on test two?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.910
So the y-axis is test two.

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.070
So let's just write them out.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.290
Student A got a 70.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.380
Student B got a 60.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.000
Student C got a 70.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.560
Student D got an 80.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.042
Student E got a 60.

00:06:19.042 --> 00:06:21.700
So 60, I don't know if
you can read that.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.050
And then there are five
points, right?

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.050
So let's see, we could
just pretend

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.360
like this is a student.

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.020
That's a 60.

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.350
So let's see.

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.620
What's 7 plus 7?

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:44.730
Is 14, plus 6 is 20, plus
8 is 28, plus 6 is 34.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.970
So it's 340 divided by 5.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:50.960
And that equals what?

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:55.280
5 goes into 360, 68.

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.050
That's the average, or
the arithmetic mean.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.600
And that's choice C.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.850
Problem number six.

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.340
OK, they do a bunch of stuff.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.590
I guess I should draw it too.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:16.480
That's the line they drew.

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:22.310
And let's see, it's
going like that.

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:25.670
Let's see, so it goes
from minus 2 to 2.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:35.475
So it's minus 2, minus 1, 0,
1, 2, and extra space.

00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:37.240
So you're going to draw a bunch
of points, so I'll do it

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:40.290
in a different color.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.790
So this is t.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.095
And they have u,
v, w, all here.

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.190
And they put an x
here, then y, z.

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:01.370
So that's y and there's z.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.850
They ask us, on the number line
above, t, u, v, w, x, y,

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.590
and z are coordinates of
the indicated points.

00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:16.610
Which of the following is
closest to the absolute value

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.970
of u plus v?

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:21.550
So this is just an approximation
problem.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.280
So you just have to kind of
look at this and guess

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.410
what u and v are.

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:29.330
So it looks like u is
about 3/4 the way

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:30.500
to negative 1, right?

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.789
So I'm just going to assume
that u is equal-- or

00:08:32.789 --> 00:08:35.770
approximately equal, I can
do a squiggly equal-- u

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.120
approximately equals negative
3/4, right?

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.780
Because it's almost
at negative 1.

00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:44.440
And then v looks halfway between
0 and negative 1, so

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.940
that looks about negative
1/2, right?

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.130
I don't know if that's
exact: negative 1/2.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:54.990
So what's the absolute value
of minus 3/4 minus 1/2?

00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.860
Well that's equal to
the absolute value.

00:08:56.860 --> 00:09:03.750
You get a common denominator of
minus 3 minus 2/4, right?

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:08.260
That equals the absolute
value of minus 5/4.

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:13.200
The absolute value of minus
5/4 is equal to 5/4.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:20.190
And if we look at the choices,
5/4, that's a little bit more

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:20.810
than 1, right?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:24.090
That's equal to 1 and 1/4.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.730
1 and 1/4?

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:27.670
This is 1, so a little
bit more than 1.

00:09:27.670 --> 00:09:30.840
It looks like choice y
is our best answer.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.900
So that is choice number D.

00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:35.880
See you in the next video.
