00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:05.370
- A nation reveals itself not
only by the men it produces,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.193
but also by the men it
honors, the men it remembers.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.930
These men did not fight for
the United States of America,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.173
they fought against it,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.730
they may have been warriors,

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.913
but in this cause they were not patriots,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.930
these statues are not
just stone and metal,

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:29.363
they are not just innocent
remembrances of a benign history,

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.200
these monuments celebrate a
fictional sanitized confederacy,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.450
ignoring the death,
ignoring the enslavement,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.810
ignoring the terror that
it actually stood for.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.780
This is not about politics,
it's not about blame,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.683
it's not about retaliation,

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.040
this is not about a naive quest to solve

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.253
all of our problems at once,

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:55.380
this is however about
showing a whole world

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.383
that we as a city, that we as people,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.970
are able to acknowledge to
understand, to reconcile

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.900
and more importantly choose
a better future for ourselves

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.650
making straight what has been crooked

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.143
and making right what was wrong.
