00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:08.230
We spend a lot of time in relationships
pointing out what's wrong with the other

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.330
person and insisting on our blamelessness. We imagine that's a good strategy

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.119
for getting what we want and for being
happy in a couple, but that's nonsense.

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:22.749
Next time you feel strong enough that
you can, for a moment,

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:29.289
stop insisting you're always right, try a
different tack. Out of the blue

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.529
say: "sorry I'm so anxious"

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.519
"sorry I lose my temper", "sorry I don't
listen enough",

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:42.309
"sorry I'm too preoccupied", "sorry I both
want you close and push you away",

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:49.390
"sorry I'm not always balanced, sane or mature". You think that might weaken you, make you

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.420
hostage to the partner's vengeance.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.309
It never does. Everything always gets
better from that point.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.489
Give it a try. Sorry I'm so crazy.
