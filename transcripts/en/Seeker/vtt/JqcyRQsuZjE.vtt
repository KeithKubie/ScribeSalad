00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.000
Cool air in the hot summer is the best...
but does it make me sicker?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.660
Hey everyone thanks for watching DNews today,
I'm Trace.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.619
American inventor Willis Carrier invented
the first AC unit in 1902, and it was first

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:23.760
put into a theater in 1925 and homes by 1965
after it had spread through commercial and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.890
retail spaces.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.009
Ancient Roman philosopher Seneca disparaged
the "skinny youths" who ate snow to keep cool

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.500
rather than bearing the heat like a real Roman.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.480
Basically what I’m trying to is that cooling
has been around now but it Cooling has been

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.640
contentious forever, and it's not getting
better.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.040
People have long felt the pull of "fresh air"
over "indoor air," and there are some studies

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.040
that support that idea.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.721
The World Health Organization uses the term
"sick building syndrome" (SBS) for people

00:00:49.721 --> 00:00:54.250
who breathe the air in a specific building
and experience similar acute health effects.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.420
A 2004 French study found of 920 women, those
who worked in air conditioned buildings were

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.000
twice as likely to take a sick day, or visit
an ear-nose-throat doctor.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.210
Plus, studies have shown cold air weakens
the immune system against viruses in mice,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.159
showing cold air MIGHT affect humans too.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:17.189
The thing is, as AC units cool the air, they
also filter it!

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.470
Fresh air ain't filtered, it's au naturale.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.810
So though the AC might be cooling the air,
it’s making it better.. maybe?

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.829
A good air conditioning unit is built around
a system of coils containing chemical refrigerants

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.719
which absorb heat from the air.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.030
The refrigerant can vary, but it's usually
some configuration of chlorofluorocarbon.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.740
The coils are a closed system of that liquid
refrigerant.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.950
When the unit is on, the coils absorb heat
from the outdoor air, passing it to the chlorofluorocarbon

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.740
which becomes a gas.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.890
That chlorofluorocarbon gas is compressed
into smaller coils, forcing it to release

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.609
the absorbed heat and return to a liquid state.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:56.909
It does this over and over and over again.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.579
That heat is blown outside and the cool air
blown inside through a HEPA filter to clean

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.579
the air a bit!

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.890
While none of that sounds particularly evil
and doesn’t seem like it would make you

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.810
sick, for some reason people are still wary
of "indoor air."

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.959
In fact, someone once said, "No pleasure,
no rapture, no exquisite sin greater... than

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.200
central air."

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.820
But there's no direct link between air conditioning
and SBS or any sickness at all, just a correlation.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.540
Scientists at the University of Cardiff say,
what's more likely is AC units dry the air

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.409
as they cool, which might dry mucous membranes
in the ears, nose or throat, allowing viruses

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:36.989
to gain a foothold... that explains the women
who were going to the doctor twice as often.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.409
Of course, sickness aside, there are QUANTIFIABLE
problems with air conditioning, AC consumes

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:47.200
5 percent of all US electricity during the
summer; that's two tons of CO2 per house per

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
year!

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.420
As the world gets richer, more and more AC
units are sold, requiring more power, and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.370
polluting even more.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.791
In the US around 90 percent of households
have AC, but in Africa, South Asia, and Central

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:01.950
America AC is still rare.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.450
Though in china 64 million AC units were sold
in China in 2013 alone!

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.250
Growing up in Michigan, where the highs can
reach mid-80s with high humidity in the summer;

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.440
we didn't even have AC until I was in Middle
School.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.030
But I have to say, What's up with restaurants
making it 55 inside when it's 85 outside?

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.530
That's the worst!

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.030
Air conditioning is great, but c'mon.

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.540
And yes, I realize this is a First world problem,
fer sure.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.969
But this is part of the energy usage issue.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:32.960
The US Department of Energy says your energy
bill increases 1-3 percent for every 1 degree

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.720
fahrenheit change (0.56 C), which means for
every degree we're putting MORE greenhouse

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720
gas out.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.900
Plus, the warmer your house, the less heat
you lose to the surrounding environment, and

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.209
the less your AC unit has to work in the summer.

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.940
65 degrees (18C) is the optimal temperature
for sleeping, to keep your home appliances

00:03:49.940 --> 00:04:29.750
humming, and anything below 70 helps you lose
weight naturally!
