00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.450
- [Narrator] A university
offers a certain course

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.880
that students can take in-person

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.900
or in an online setting.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.630
Teachers of the course were curious

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.510
if there was a difference
in the passing rate

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.250
between the two settings.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.260
Data from a recent semester showed

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.480
that 80% of students passed
the in-person setting

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.630
and 75% of students
passed the online setting.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.050
They were willing to treat these

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.530
as representative samples of all students

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:27.510
who may take each setting of the course.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.520
The teachers used those results to make

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.240
a 95% confidence interval to estimate

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.370
the difference between
the proportion of students

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.260
who pass in each setting of the course.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.730
So this is a 95% confidence interval

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.150
for the difference between the proportion

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.780
who passed the in-person course

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.840
and the online course.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.970
The resulting interval was approximately,

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.863
it went from negative 0.04 to 0.14.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.430
Just to make sure we understand

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.640
what this is saying, this is saying 95%

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.640
of the time that you go through this,

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.550
because we're talking about
a 95% confidence interval,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.680
95% of the time you take these samples

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.680
and then you construct
a confidence interval

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.990
for the difference in proportions,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.350
that it will actually
contain the true proportion.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.920
They want to use this interval to test

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.880
their null hypothesis
that the true proportions

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.730
are the same versus their
alternative hypothesis

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.060
that the true proportions are different.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.190
Assume that all conditions for inference

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.510
have been met.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.960
Based on the interval, what do we know

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.970
about the corresponding P-value

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.320
and conclusion to their test?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.323
So pause this video and try to figure out

00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:37.113
on your own.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.010
All right, so what's interesting here

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.300
is we're going to use
a confidence interval

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.970
to think about a hypothesis test.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.430
Remember, in a hypothesis test

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.230
we assume that our null
hypothesis is true.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.080
We'll assume this.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.310
There's another way we could write it.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.470
We could write it like this,
that the difference between

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.470
the in-person and the
online, true proportions,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.670
is equal to zero.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.410
These are equivalent statements.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.040
In a hypothesis test, we will assume

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.890
that this is true.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.060
Then in a traditional hypothesis test,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.610
we set some significance level.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.040
So let's say we set that
significance level at 5%

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.590
and that is a very typical
significance level.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.573
And if the results we
get, if the probability

00:02:21.573 --> 00:02:25.510
of getting the results that we do get

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.100
for the difference in
the sample proportions

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.620
is less than 5%, we say
hey that's pretty unlikely

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.800
we're gonna reject the null hypothesis

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.960
which will suggest the alternative.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.220
But here we have something interesting.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.470
We have a confidence interval.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.360
It turns out that if the
sum of your confidence level

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.410
and your significance
level is equal to 100%

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.470
and you're doing a
two-sided hypothesis test,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.210
so you're thinking about well,

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.270
our alternative hypothesis isn't just that

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.560
the in-person is greater than the online,

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.120
or that it's less than the online,

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.520
it's that they are different.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.770
We have a two-sided hypothesis test.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.220
In these situations you can
actually make some inferences

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.740
about your P value from
your confidence interval.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.860
Think about it this way, we are assuming

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.610
our null hypothesis is true when

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.330
we do this hypothesis test.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.160
And so when we construct
a 95% confidence interval,

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.140
we would expect that 95%
of confidence intervals

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.007
would overlap with zero.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.230
Where did I get zero from?

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.070
Remember, this is a confidence interval

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.910
for the difference in proportions.

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:46.750
Our null hypothesis is
that the true difference

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.390
in proportions is zero.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.880
So 95% of the time that we do this,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.310
if we assume that the
null hypothesis is true,

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.730
we will overlap with zero.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.960
Or another way you can think about it.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.960
5% of confidence intervals
would not overlap with zero.

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:14.340
So if you are in a situation where

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.990
you go through this process, you try

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.330
to construct a 95% confidence interval

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:22.030
and you don't overlap with
your assumed difference

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.920
of the true proportions
from your null hypothesis,

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.070
well in this situation your P value

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.180
is going to be less than
your 5% significance level.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.180
In this situation you would
reject your null hypothesis.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.530
In this first situation your P value

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.160
is going to be greater than
or equal to your alpha level

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.073
and you would fail to reject.

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:51.310
So what's the situation here?

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.320
Well our interval actually does include

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.550
the assumed difference in true proportions

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.430
from the null hypothesis.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.513
So that means assuming the null hypothesis

00:05:01.513 --> 00:05:04.150
we are in this first scenario.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:07.270
This is one of the 95%
of confidence intervals

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.730
where we actually did overlap with

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:13.610
the true parameter that
we are trying to estimate.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.690
In that situation our P value is going

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.250
to be greater than or equal to our alpha,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.048
which in this case is 5%.

00:05:19.048 --> 00:05:21.690
So we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.730
So there isn't evidence to suggest

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.590
that there is a true difference

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.610
in passing grades between the in-person

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.963
and the online exam.
