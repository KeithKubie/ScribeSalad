to my poor Z colleagues so we'll skip
 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.500
to my poor Z colleagues so we'll skip
past that

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
past that
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.740
past that
so what we will look at though is some

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750
so what we will look at though is some
 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.899
so what we will look at though is some
of the steps that we've taken to kind of

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909
of the steps that we've taken to kind of
 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.820
of the steps that we've taken to kind of
address and some of the visuals and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830
address and some of the visuals and
 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.170
address and some of the visuals and
we're gonna take it step by step and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180
we're gonna take it step by step and
 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.500
we're gonna take it step by step and
build it build it up so one of the first

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
build it build it up so one of the first
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.649
build it build it up so one of the first
things I looked at is the action bar so

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
things I looked at is the action bar so
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.970
things I looked at is the action bar so
one of my favorite components one of the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980
one of my favorite components one of the
 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.759
one of my favorite components one of the
key navigational components in the

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769
key navigational components in the
 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.220
key navigational components in the
Android platform and I'm not sure if it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
Android platform and I'm not sure if it
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.690
Android platform and I'm not sure if it
as a conscious choice but reach I picked

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
as a conscious choice but reach I picked
 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.880
as a conscious choice but reach I picked
this kind of an blue color to the action

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890
this kind of an blue color to the action
 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.190
this kind of an blue color to the action
bar and one of my problems is this is

one of the stock Android holo colors and
 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.350
one of the stock Android holo colors and
I find if an application kind of goes

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
I find if an application kind of goes
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.940
I find if an application kind of goes
with this kind of like stock kind of

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950
with this kind of like stock kind of
 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.069
with this kind of like stock kind of

you're just kind of using them out of

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780
you're just kind of using them out of
 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.380

the box component so what I decide to do

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390
the box component so what I decide to do
 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:58.400
the box component so what I decide to do
is like what I'm going to think of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410
is like what I'm going to think of
 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.589
is like what I'm going to think of
Cricut I kind of think of like green

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599
Cricut I kind of think of like green
 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.479

then a red ball and that's kind of
 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.930
then a red ball and that's kind of
palette I think to work with so we

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940
palette I think to work with so we
 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.210
palette I think to work with so we
instead reskin that using this kind of

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
instead reskin that using this kind of
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.559

we're going to extend throughout the app
 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.229
we're going to extend throughout the app
later on and then went for a and

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239
later on and then went for a and
 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.759
later on and then went for a and
monochrome icon which works quite well

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769
monochrome icon which works quite well

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180
text as well there so picking up on the
 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.370
text as well there so picking up on the
weight at the iPhone we've used we've

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380
weight at the iPhone we've used we've
 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.680
weight at the iPhone we've used we've
gone for a slightly heavier heavier

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690
gone for a slightly heavier heavier
 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.650
gone for a slightly heavier heavier
weight so here we have robust or bold

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660
weight so here we have robust or bold
 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.379
weight so here we have robust or bold
condensed and a slightly larger font

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389
condensed and a slightly larger font
 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.530
condensed and a slightly larger font
size so again I pick up on the on the

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
size so again I pick up on the on the
 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.599
size so again I pick up on the on the
icons weight as well as we went with the

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:44.609
icons weight as well as we went with the
 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.470
icons weight as well as we went with the
metallic and theme there to kind of give

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480
metallic and theme there to kind of give
 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.900
metallic and theme there to kind of give
it some kind of emotion and as well as

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910
it some kind of emotion and as well as
 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.449
it some kind of emotion and as well as
adding some of the usual items you might

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459
adding some of the usual items you might
 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.009
adding some of the usual items you might
find in the action bar so retailer said

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019
find in the action bar so retailer said
 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.539
find in the action bar so retailer said
he's going to navigation bra so we added

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549
he's going to navigation bra so we added
 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.390
he's going to navigation bra so we added
the thrall affordance there and as well

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400
the thrall affordance there and as well
 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.379
the thrall affordance there and as well
as adding search and home so step one we

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389
as adding search and home so step one we
 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.849
as adding search and home so step one we
had a little look at the action bar and

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859
had a little look at the action bar and
 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:06.619
had a little look at the action bar and
showed it some visual love one of the

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629
showed it some visual love one of the
 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.119
showed it some visual love one of the
things that I really like about this is

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.129
things that I really like about this is
 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:10.250
things that I really like about this is
specifically when you look at the the

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260
specifically when you look at the the
 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.670
specifically when you look at the the
way the icon is juxtaposed with the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680
way the icon is juxtaposed with the
 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.580
way the icon is juxtaposed with the
title the weights of the of the glyphs

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590
title the weights of the of the glyphs
 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.410
title the weights of the of the glyphs
and the font are are actually

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420
and the font are are actually
 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.050
and the font are are actually
you know not really similar but they

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060
you know not really similar but they
 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.210
you know not really similar but they
balance well with the thickness of the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220
balance well with the thickness of the
 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.840
balance well with the thickness of the
of the icon so it's not like the icon is

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850
of the icon so it's not like the icon is
 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.630
of the icon so it's not like the icon is
overpowering the tete the title text or

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640
overpowering the tete the title text or
 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.520
overpowering the tete the title text or
vice versa it's actually very nicely

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530
vice versa it's actually very nicely
 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.890
vice versa it's actually very nicely
balanced so I think that bold condensed

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900
balanced so I think that bold condensed
 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.020
balanced so I think that bold condensed
works really well here moving on okay

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030
works really well here moving on okay
 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.780
works really well here moving on okay
step two so what we picked an accent

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790
step two so what we picked an accent
 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.520
step two so what we picked an accent
color we then and took a look at the

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530
color we then and took a look at the
 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.960
color we then and took a look at the
rest of the pallet in the application so

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970
rest of the pallet in the application so
 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.550
rest of the pallet in the application so
we extended the accent color throughout

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560
we extended the accent color throughout
 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.070
we extended the accent color throughout
so you can see it in the the header and

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080
so you can see it in the the header and
 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.960
so you can see it in the the header and
in the kind of page indicator we picked

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970
in the kind of page indicator we picked
 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.660
in the kind of page indicator we picked
up how to same color and but also the

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670
up how to same color and but also the
 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.490
up how to same color and but also the
original use this kind of quite quite

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500
original use this kind of quite quite
 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.950
original use this kind of quite quite
stark contrasting palette so we had like

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960
stark contrasting palette so we had like
 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.530
stark contrasting palette so we had like
a near black and section to the top and

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540
a near black and section to the top and
 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.470
a near black and section to the top and
then a white section below very very

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480
then a white section below very very
 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.750
then a white section below very very
highly contrasting and it kind of felt

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760
highly contrasting and it kind of felt
 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.980
highly contrasting and it kind of felt
to me a little bit to visually

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990
to me a little bit to visually
 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.380
to me a little bit to visually
contrasting and as a side note you want

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390
contrasting and as a side note you want
 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.230
contrasting and as a side note you want
to be quite careful in your use of pure

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240
to be quite careful in your use of pure
 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.480
to be quite careful in your use of pure
white very very bland pure white colors

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490
white very very bland pure white colors
 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.780
white very very bland pure white colors
just uses the technology and most most

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790
just uses the technology and most most
 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.700
just uses the technology and most most
phones and tablets users have in their

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710
phones and tablets users have in their
 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.200
phones and tablets users have in their
hands have these very very bright

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210
hands have these very very bright
 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.810
hands have these very very bright
screens so using pure white can actually

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820
screens so using pure white can actually
 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.420
screens so using pure white can actually
be kind of overpowering so you want to

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430
be kind of overpowering so you want to
 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.980
be kind of overpowering so you want to
reserve pure white for something which

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990
reserve pure white for something which
 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.720
reserve pure white for something which
you want to draw attention to you want

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730
you want to draw attention to you want
 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.700
you want to draw attention to you want
to have some stark contrast not so much

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
to have some stark contrast not so much
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.160
to have some stark contrast not so much
for kind of a background panel so what

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:35.170
for kind of a background panel so what
 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:36.570
for kind of a background panel so what
we've done here is we kind of muted the

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580
we've done here is we kind of muted the
 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.850
we've done here is we kind of muted the
color scheme down a little bit so we've

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860
color scheme down a little bit so we've
 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.950
color scheme down a little bit so we've
gone fit these kind of them off white

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960
gone fit these kind of them off white
 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.320
gone fit these kind of them off white
and some kind of gray back background

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330
and some kind of gray back background
 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.700
and some kind of gray back background
just to kind of make it a little easy on

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710
just to kind of make it a little easy on
 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.910
just to kind of make it a little easy on
the eye a little less contrasting yeah

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:47.920
the eye a little less contrasting yeah
 

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.820
the eye a little less contrasting yeah
perfect Morgan yeah so next we took a

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830
perfect Morgan yeah so next we took a
 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.950
perfect Morgan yeah so next we took a
little look at the metrics and so

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960
little look at the metrics and so
 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.360
little look at the metrics and so
there's a few things you can do to your

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370
there's a few things you can do to your
 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.670
there's a few things you can do to your
applications to really easily make it

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680
applications to really easily make it
 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.400
applications to really easily make it
easier to both scan and then to work out

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410
easier to both scan and then to work out
 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.230
easier to both scan and then to work out
you know what items are belong together

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240
you know what items are belong together
 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.000
you know what items are belong together
and which items are separate so we

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.010
and which items are separate so we
 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:09.660
and which items are separate so we
applied the standard kind of 8 and 16

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670
applied the standard kind of 8 and 16
 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.240
applied the standard kind of 8 and 16
dip grid which we commonly talked about

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250
dip grid which we commonly talked about
 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:14.460
dip grid which we commonly talked about
here on a show and to this to this

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:14.470
here on a show and to this to this
 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.110
here on a show and to this to this
screen here so you can see here with

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120
screen here so you can see here with
 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.670
screen here so you can see here with
discomfort we just moved some of the

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:17.680
discomfort we just moved some of the
 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.190
discomfort we just moved some of the
kind of lines around change the margins

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:20.200
kind of lines around change the margins
 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.210
kind of lines around change the margins
and the spacings just to line up to this

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220
and the spacings just to line up to this
 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:26.130
and the spacings just to line up to this
it's majorly a 16 dip grit and then for

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140
it's majorly a 16 dip grit and then for
 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.430
it's majorly a 16 dip grit and then for
any minor kind of

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440
any minor kind of
 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.590
any minor kind of
into listitem kind of spacing we've gone

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:29.600
into listitem kind of spacing we've gone
 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.420
into listitem kind of spacing we've gone
4-h or sometimes even for dips

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430
4-h or sometimes even for dips
 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.040
4-h or sometimes even for dips
so basically we're using this kind of

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050
so basically we're using this kind of
 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.160
so basically we're using this kind of
system ribbon and it just makes it feel

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170
system ribbon and it just makes it feel
 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.440
system ribbon and it just makes it feel
much easier to kind of like work out

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:38.450
much easier to kind of like work out
 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:40.600
much easier to kind of like work out
what belongs together and see how things

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610
what belongs together and see how things
 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.790
what belongs together and see how things
should be spaced out not really related

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800
should be spaced out not really related
 

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.690
should be spaced out not really related
to the metrics if I also swapped I don't

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:46.700
to the metrics if I also swapped I don't
 

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.920
to the metrics if I also swapped I don't
want to talk about I want to swap out

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:47.930
want to talk about I want to swap out
 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:50.860
want to talk about I want to swap out
the view and the view page indicated

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:50.870
the view and the view page indicated
 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:52.840
the view and the view page indicated
here as well so instead of them I think

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850
here as well so instead of them I think
 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.550
here as well so instead of them I think
before we have four dots with one of

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560
before we have four dots with one of
 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.140
before we have four dots with one of
them cousin I said I've gone to this

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150
them cousin I said I've gone to this
 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.510
them cousin I said I've gone to this
kind of par with a kind of coven kind of

00:06:58.510 --> 00:06:58.520
kind of par with a kind of coven kind of
 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.550
kind of par with a kind of coven kind of
almost like a scroll bar it's a slightly

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560
almost like a scroll bar it's a slightly
 

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.620
almost like a scroll bar it's a slightly
more androidy design like having these

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:02.630
more androidy design like having these
 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.740
more androidy design like having these
angled you know flatter kind of lines

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:05.750
angled you know flatter kind of lines
 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.540
angled you know flatter kind of lines
rather than these dots which is a bit of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550
rather than these dots which is a bit of
 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.150
rather than these dots which is a bit of
a hangover from kind of the IRS design

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.160
a hangover from kind of the IRS design
 

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.270
a hangover from kind of the IRS design
guys and you'll see this view pager or

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280
guys and you'll see this view pager or
 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.640
guys and you'll see this view pager or
this pager indicator I guess in apps

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650
this pager indicator I guess in apps
 

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.170
this pager indicator I guess in apps
like the launcher obviously you know

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:17.180
like the launcher obviously you know
 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:18.250
like the launcher obviously you know
when you swipe between your different

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:18.260
when you swipe between your different
 

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.260
when you swipe between your different
home screens although it's a little hard

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:20.270
home screens although it's a little hard
 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.450
home screens although it's a little hard
to see there as well as apps like Google

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:22.460
to see there as well as apps like Google
 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:27.640
to see there as well as apps like Google
Currents X it keeps the assistant

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650
Currents X it keeps the assistant
 

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.930
Currents X it keeps the assistant
whereas launcher kind of fades it out

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:28.940
whereas launcher kind of fades it out
 

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:30.670
whereas launcher kind of fades it out
which is kind of subtle and it's right

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:30.680
which is kind of subtle and it's right
 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.170
which is kind of subtle and it's right
for a home screen but I think that's

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180
for a home screen but I think that's
 

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.250
for a home screen but I think that's
something where you actually want in

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260
something where you actually want in
 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.990
something where you actually want in
together there's more content this is

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.000
together there's more content this is
 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.210
together there's more content this is
kind of present design like works works

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:37.220
kind of present design like works works
 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.280
kind of present design like works works
very well yeah one of the things I want

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.290
very well yeah one of the things I want
 

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:40.540
very well yeah one of the things I want
to point out as you mentioned you know

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:40.550
to point out as you mentioned you know
 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.880
to point out as you mentioned you know
grouping the ability for whitespace and

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:42.890
grouping the ability for whitespace and
 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.880
grouping the ability for whitespace and
margins to to communicate relationships

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:45.890
margins to to communicate relationships
 

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.920
margins to to communicate relationships
between elements and kind of group

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:47.930
between elements and kind of group
 

00:07:47.930 --> 00:07:49.300
between elements and kind of group
things together this is something that

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:49.310
things together this is something that
 

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:51.790
things together this is something that
that Alex paperwork talks about a lot in

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:51.800
that Alex paperwork talks about a lot in
 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.800
that Alex paperwork talks about a lot in
in a couple of his talks in Google i/o

00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:53.810
in a couple of his talks in Google i/o
 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.140
in a couple of his talks in Google i/o
this year and I think last year as well

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150
this year and I think last year as well
 

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.970
this year and I think last year as well
but basically the I think it's the

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:57.980
but basically the I think it's the
 

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:00.490
but basically the I think it's the
gestalt principle for you know for

00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:00.500
gestalt principle for you know for
 

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.530
gestalt principle for you know for
grouping you know placing items in close

00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:02.540
grouping you know placing items in close
 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.050
grouping you know placing items in close
proximity naturally implies a grouping

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:05.060
proximity naturally implies a grouping
 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.780
proximity naturally implies a grouping
so it helps here I think to communicate

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:07.790
so it helps here I think to communicate
 

00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:09.580
so it helps here I think to communicate
these are individual elements you almost

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.590
these are individual elements you almost
 

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.290
these are individual elements you almost
can imagine like what would happen if

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:11.300
can imagine like what would happen if
 

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.940
can imagine like what would happen if
you removed all the the list item

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:12.950
you removed all the the list item
 

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.220
you removed all the the list item
separators right would be the structure

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:15.230
separators right would be the structure
 

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:17.140
separators right would be the structure
still be a parent and I think in this

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:17.150
still be a parent and I think in this
 

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:19.180
still be a parent and I think in this
case it would given that there are ample

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:19.190
case it would given that there are ample
 

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:21.220
case it would given that there are ample
margins it also makes for a much better

00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:21.230
margins it also makes for a much better
 

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.500
margins it also makes for a much better

down your I can naturally land on an

00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520
down your I can naturally land on an
 

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.640
down your I can naturally land on an
individual item and once you actually

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:27.650
individual item and once you actually
 

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.540
individual item and once you actually
see something interesting on an

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:28.550
see something interesting on an
 

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.160
see something interesting on an
individual item then you can kind of

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.170
individual item then you can kind of
 

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.990
individual item then you can kind of
spend one more time to explore it rather

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:32.000
spend one more time to explore it rather
 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.820
spend one more time to explore it rather
than having to parse out which are the

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:33.830
than having to parse out which are the
 

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.380
than having to parse out which are the
individual items in your list

00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:36.390
individual items in your list
 

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:41.209
individual items in your list
great cool and then the the last step

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219
great cool and then the the last step
 

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:42.769
great cool and then the the last step
that we took on this on this screen here

00:08:42.769 --> 00:08:42.779
that we took on this on this screen here
 

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:45.259
that we took on this on this screen here
if you then apply some different type of

00:08:45.259 --> 00:08:45.269
if you then apply some different type of
 

00:08:45.269 --> 00:08:47.660
if you then apply some different type of
graphical treatments and to really tease

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:47.670
graphical treatments and to really tease
 

00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:51.470
graphical treatments and to really tease
out the information hierarchy so in the

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:51.480
out the information hierarchy so in the
 

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.670
out the information hierarchy so in the
previous design like though all the

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680
previous design like though all the
 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.630
previous design like though all the
information was there but was a little

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:53.640
information was there but was a little
 

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.569
information was there but was a little
bit overwhelming to try and understand

00:08:56.569 --> 00:08:56.579
bit overwhelming to try and understand
 

00:08:56.579 --> 00:08:58.370
bit overwhelming to try and understand
what was the most important and nothing

00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:58.380
what was the most important and nothing
 

00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.569
what was the most important and nothing
really jumped out to you you kind of

00:08:59.569 --> 00:08:59.579
really jumped out to you you kind of
 

00:08:59.579 --> 00:09:01.160
really jumped out to you you kind of
came across as kind of almost too dense

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.170
came across as kind of almost too dense
 

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.199
came across as kind of almost too dense
as blocks of text so what we've done

00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:03.209
as blocks of text so what we've done
 

00:09:03.209 --> 00:09:08.800
as blocks of text so what we've done
here is we've used things like color and

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:08.810
here is we've used things like color and
 

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:11.150
here is we've used things like color and
additionally different sizes and weight

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160
additionally different sizes and weight
 

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.639
additionally different sizes and weight
of the different and text to kind of

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:13.649
of the different and text to kind of
 

00:09:13.649 --> 00:09:15.290
of the different and text to kind of
really tease out what is the most

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300
really tease out what is the most
 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.850
really tease out what is the most
important so I think the first thing I

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:16.860
important so I think the first thing I
 

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.440
important so I think the first thing I
look at is you know the school obviously

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:18.450
look at is you know the school obviously
 

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.269
look at is you know the school obviously
jumps out up straight straight away at

00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279
jumps out up straight straight away at
 

00:09:20.279 --> 00:09:22.190
jumps out up straight straight away at
you as well as the team names in the

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:22.200
you as well as the team names in the
 

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.900
you as well as the team names in the
summary section and then scaling down

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:23.910
summary section and then scaling down
 

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.910
summary section and then scaling down
the upcoming list it's very very easy to

00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920
the upcoming list it's very very easy to
 

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.280
the upcoming list it's very very easy to
quickly pass this list and find a game

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:28.290
quickly pass this list and find a game
 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.600
quickly pass this list and find a game
you know you're going to look at it look

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:29.610
you know you're going to look at it look
 

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.069
you know you're going to look at it look
at this list and see all right that's

00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079
at this list and see all right that's
 

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:32.840
at this list and see all right that's
the game I'm looking for and then you

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:32.850
the game I'm looking for and then you
 

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.660
the game I'm looking for and then you
can like deep dive further down to find

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:35.670
can like deep dive further down to find
 

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.060
can like deep dive further down to find
subsequent information so by using these

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:38.070
subsequent information so by using these
 

00:09:38.070 --> 00:09:39.860
subsequent information so by using these
different text sizes colors and weights

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:39.870
different text sizes colors and weights
 

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:43.370
different text sizes colors and weights
and it's it's really I think helps tease

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:43.380
and it's it's really I think helps tease
 

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.040
and it's it's really I think helps tease
out the information hierarchy so one of

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.050
out the information hierarchy so one of
 

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.540
out the information hierarchy so one of
the things we want didn't want to do is

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:47.550
the things we want didn't want to do is
 

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.220
the things we want didn't want to do is
introduce too much complexity so there

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.230
introduce too much complexity so there
 

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.740
introduce too much complexity so there
is actually only and two different font

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:51.750
is actually only and two different font
 

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.910
is actually only and two different font
size of three different font sizes if

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.920
size of three different font sizes if
 

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.650
size of three different font sizes if
you include the score on the screen here

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:54.660
you include the score on the screen here
 

00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.720
you include the score on the screen here
so it's not too busy there's not too

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:56.730
so it's not too busy there's not too
 

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.370
so it's not too busy there's not too
much going on but by using these

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380
much going on but by using these
 

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.960
much going on but by using these
different colors and weights we can

00:09:59.960 --> 00:09:59.970
different colors and weights we can
 

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.900
different colors and weights we can
really establish the hierarchy yeah I

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:02.910
really establish the hierarchy yeah I
 

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.650
really establish the hierarchy yeah I
think that really makes a huge

00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:03.660
think that really makes a huge
 

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:05.329
think that really makes a huge
difference and I think we've mentioned

00:10:05.329 --> 00:10:05.339
difference and I think we've mentioned
 

00:10:05.339 --> 00:10:06.980
difference and I think we've mentioned
this before on the show but I was

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:06.990
this before on the show but I was
 

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.569
this before on the show but I was
actually looking at the two screen sort

00:10:08.569 --> 00:10:08.579
actually looking at the two screen sort
 

00:10:08.579 --> 00:10:10.009
actually looking at the two screen sort
of from a distance because we've got a

00:10:10.009 --> 00:10:10.019
of from a distance because we've got a
 

00:10:10.019 --> 00:10:13.790
of from a distance because we've got a
TV here to view the slides and when you

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800
TV here to view the slides and when you
 

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.530
TV here to view the slides and when you
take a step back you can really see what

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:15.540
take a step back you can really see what
 

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:17.509
take a step back you can really see what
the difference that it makes when you

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519
the difference that it makes when you
 

00:10:17.519 --> 00:10:18.800
the difference that it makes when you
look at it from that distance like you

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:18.810
look at it from that distance like you
 

00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:21.560
look at it from that distance like you
can see the the titles very clearly as

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:21.570
can see the the titles very clearly as
 

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:23.000
can see the the titles very clearly as
opposed to the old screenshot where you

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.010
opposed to the old screenshot where you
 

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:25.430
opposed to the old screenshot where you
just sort of say these blur sections of

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:25.440
just sort of say these blur sections of
 

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.960
just sort of say these blur sections of
text which you can't really understand

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:26.970
text which you can't really understand
 

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.200
text which you can't really understand
or comprehend very well

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:29.210

one thing I want to pick up on is the

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:30.920
one thing I want to pick up on is the
 

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.620
one thing I want to pick up on is the
use of kind of like the ball cap style

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:32.630
use of kind of like the ball cap style
 

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.690
use of kind of like the ball cap style
which is fairly commonly used in Android

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:34.700
which is fairly commonly used in Android
 

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.610
which is fairly commonly used in Android
it's actually sometimes use for the less

00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:36.620
it's actually sometimes use for the less
 

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.440
it's actually sometimes use for the less
important information so it might seem

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:38.450
important information so it might seem
 

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.660
important information so it might seem
kind of counter to counter intuitive to

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:40.670
kind of counter to counter intuitive to
 

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:42.670
kind of counter to counter intuitive to
when you might use capitals you might

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:42.680
when you might use capitals you might
 

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.960
when you might use capitals you might
think there's a shouting but quite

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:43.970
think there's a shouting but quite
 

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:45.910
think there's a shouting but quite
commonly in Android we'll use a smaller

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920
commonly in Android we'll use a smaller
 

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.800
commonly in Android we'll use a smaller
and text lightest with a kind of a

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:47.810
and text lightest with a kind of a
 

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.750
and text lightest with a kind of a
lighter font color this full value

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:49.760
lighter font color this full value
 

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.690
lighter font color this full value
perhaps coupled with your cap style and

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:52.700
perhaps coupled with your cap style and
 

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.850
perhaps coupled with your cap style and
it really is this kind of like by lionel

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:54.860
it really is this kind of like by lionel

some credit I will say that you know the
 

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.620
some credit I will say that you know the
the amount of information I think was

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:11.630
the amount of information I think was
 

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:13.150
the amount of information I think was
accurate was it was correct right I mean

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160
accurate was it was correct right I mean
 

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.890

and I will say that I'll caveat that I

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:14.900
and I will say that I'll caveat that I

know nothing about cricket but one of

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:17.840
know nothing about cricket but one of
 

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.670
know nothing about cricket but one of
the things that you should also think

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:18.680
the things that you should also think
 

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.560
the things that you should also think
about in terms of typography and what to

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:20.570
about in terms of typography and what to
 

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:22.180
about in terms of typography and what to
put on your screen is you know are you

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.190
put on your screen is you know are you
 

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.910
put on your screen is you know are you
put are you showing too much at once are

00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920
put are you showing too much at once are
 

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:26.890
put are you showing too much at once are
you showing too little and if I will say

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:26.900
you showing too little and if I will say
 

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.380
you showing too little and if I will say
that I feel like Rado in the original

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:29.390
that I feel like Rado in the original
 

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:31.420
that I feel like Rado in the original
design was actually showing the the

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:31.430
design was actually showing the the
 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.950
design was actually showing the the
right amount of detail the right amount

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:32.960
right amount of detail the right amount
 

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:36.220

nothing about cricket but I think that
it's really you know once you decide

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:39.650
it's really you know once you decide
 

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.670
it's really you know once you decide
what to show and really kind of pick and

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:42.680
what to show and really kind of pick and
 

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.230
what to show and really kind of pick and
choose and again you're on mobile you

00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240
choose and again you're on mobile you
 

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.350
choose and again you're on mobile you
don't want to cloud the users you know

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:46.360
don't want to cloud the users you know
 

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.510
don't want to cloud the users you know
context with with too much stuff you

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:49.520
context with with too much stuff you
 

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.860
context with with too much stuff you
don't to cloud their vision with too

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:50.870
don't to cloud their vision with too
 

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.960
don't to cloud their vision with too
much unnecessary information but once

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:52.970
much unnecessary information but once
 

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:54.610
much unnecessary information but once
you decide what to what to show you have

00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:54.620
you decide what to what to show you have
 

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:56.650
you decide what to what to show you have
to really think about how to show it how

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:56.660
to really think about how to show it how
 

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:58.630
to really think about how to show it how
to kind of portray the hierarchy and I

00:11:58.630 --> 00:11:58.640
to kind of portray the hierarchy and I
 

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:01.120
to kind of portray the hierarchy and I
think that's where typography really can

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:01.130
think that's where typography really can
 

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.280
think that's where typography really can
really help yeah the one thing like that

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:03.290
really help yeah the one thing like that
 

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:05.470
really help yeah the one thing like that
that I wasn't quite sure about was I

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:05.480
that I wasn't quite sure about was I
 

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.960
that I wasn't quite sure about was I
think the second flag the second England

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:07.970
think the second flag the second England
 

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.850
think the second flag the second England
flag on the left screen here Kingdom

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:09.860
flag on the left screen here Kingdom
 

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:13.740
flag on the left screen here Kingdom
notes on the only one I think it denotes

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:13.750
notes on the only one I think it denotes
 

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.690
notes on the only one I think it denotes
though you keep me bowling next to the

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:16.700
though you keep me bowling next to the
 

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.340
though you keep me bowling next to the
number of overs Bowl and I found that

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:18.350
number of overs Bowl and I found that
 

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:19.900
number of overs Bowl and I found that
kind of repetition of the visual a

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:19.910
kind of repetition of the visual a
 

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:21.370
kind of repetition of the visual a
little bit kind of jarring kind of a

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:21.380
little bit kind of jarring kind of a
 

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.870
little bit kind of jarring kind of a
little bit I mean she just so I swap

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880
little bit I mean she just so I swap
 

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.330
little bit I mean she just so I swap
that out for a red dot which is supposed

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:25.340
that out for a red dot which is supposed
 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:26.760
that out for a red dot which is supposed
to look a bit like a cricket ball right

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:26.770
to look a bit like a cricket ball right
 

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.650
to look a bit like a cricket ball right
so I thought that clean of the visuals

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:29.660
so I thought that clean of the visuals
 

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:30.940
so I thought that clean of the visuals
and also made it feel a bit more

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:30.950
and also made it feel a bit more
 

00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:34.750
and also made it feel a bit more
balanced Karen okay yeah I actually I

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:34.760
balanced Karen okay yeah I actually I
 

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.400
balanced Karen okay yeah I actually I
remember making some minor tweaks here

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:36.410
remember making some minor tweaks here
 

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.260
remember making some minor tweaks here
and I wasn't quite sure what was going

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:38.270
and I wasn't quite sure what was going
 

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:39.430
and I wasn't quite sure what was going
on again because I know nothing about

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:39.440
on again because I know nothing about
 

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.249
on again because I know nothing about
cricket

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:40.259
cricket
 

00:12:40.259 --> 00:12:43.129
cricket
I guess it's another election no your

00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:43.139
I guess it's another election no your
 

00:12:43.139 --> 00:12:44.900
I guess it's another election no your
users know what you're designing before

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:44.910
users know what you're designing before
 

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:45.829
users know what you're designing before
you design it so

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839
you design it so
 

00:12:45.839 --> 00:12:48.049
you design it so
all right let's crack on so the other

00:12:48.049 --> 00:12:48.059
all right let's crack on so the other
 

00:12:48.059 --> 00:12:49.849
all right let's crack on so the other
thing we would this exercise I've been

00:12:49.849 --> 00:12:49.859
thing we would this exercise I've been
 

00:12:49.859 --> 00:12:51.889
thing we would this exercise I've been
cleaning up you know it's showing how

00:12:51.889 --> 00:12:51.899
cleaning up you know it's showing how
 

00:12:51.899 --> 00:12:53.599
cleaning up you know it's showing how
easy it is to perform a few tweaks on

00:12:53.599 --> 00:12:53.609
easy it is to perform a few tweaks on
 

00:12:53.609 --> 00:12:55.340
easy it is to perform a few tweaks on
the information in reach I've done the

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:55.350
the information in reach I've done the
 

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.199
the information in reach I've done the
hard work like Roman says the hard work

00:12:57.199 --> 00:12:57.209
hard work like Roman says the hard work
 

00:12:57.209 --> 00:12:58.969
hard work like Roman says the hard work
is deciding what to show on the screen

00:12:58.969 --> 00:12:58.979
is deciding what to show on the screen
 

00:12:58.979 --> 00:13:00.769
is deciding what to show on the screen
and how much information to show we just

00:13:00.769 --> 00:13:00.779
and how much information to show we just
 

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.269
and how much information to show we just
kind of provided a little few visual

00:13:02.269 --> 00:13:02.279
kind of provided a little few visual
 

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:03.889
kind of provided a little few visual
tweaks to make it easier to scan and

00:13:03.889 --> 00:13:03.899
tweaks to make it easier to scan and
 

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:06.379
tweaks to make it easier to scan and
easier to conceive and then another

00:13:06.379 --> 00:13:06.389
easier to conceive and then another
 

00:13:06.389 --> 00:13:07.669
easier to conceive and then another
thing we're going to do this exercise is

00:13:07.669 --> 00:13:07.679
thing we're going to do this exercise is
 

00:13:07.679 --> 00:13:10.009
thing we're going to do this exercise is
just demonstrate how you would take such

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:10.019
just demonstrate how you would take such
 

00:13:10.019 --> 00:13:11.989
just demonstrate how you would take such
a you know such a mark and then

00:13:11.989 --> 00:13:11.999
a you know such a mark and then
 

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.939
a you know such a mark and then
communicate that design to a developer

00:13:13.939 --> 00:13:13.949
communicate that design to a developer
 

00:13:13.949 --> 00:13:16.099
communicate that design to a developer
so here's an example of them the kind of

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:16.109
so here's an example of them the kind of
 

00:13:16.109 --> 00:13:17.539
so here's an example of them the kind of
technique we use in our applications

00:13:17.539 --> 00:13:17.549
technique we use in our applications
 

00:13:17.549 --> 00:13:19.789
technique we use in our applications
here and it's kind of like redlining

00:13:19.789 --> 00:13:19.799
here and it's kind of like redlining
 

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.889
here and it's kind of like redlining
technique where we'll actually you know

00:13:21.889 --> 00:13:21.899
technique where we'll actually you know
 

00:13:21.899 --> 00:13:23.689
technique where we'll actually you know
overlay the document with these kind of

00:13:23.689 --> 00:13:23.699
overlay the document with these kind of
 

00:13:23.699 --> 00:13:28.309
overlay the document with these kind of
red boxes and annotations I guess it's

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:28.319
red boxes and annotations I guess it's
 

00:13:28.319 --> 00:13:31.009
red boxes and annotations I guess it's
showing exactly what font sizing spacing

00:13:31.009 --> 00:13:31.019
showing exactly what font sizing spacing
 

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:32.779
showing exactly what font sizing spacing
and going through and just really

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:32.789
and going through and just really
 

00:13:32.789 --> 00:13:34.219
and going through and just really
documenting everything including there's

00:13:34.219 --> 00:13:34.229
documenting everything including there's
 

00:13:34.229 --> 00:13:35.779
documenting everything including there's
an example of like the touch highlight

00:13:35.779 --> 00:13:35.789
an example of like the touch highlight
 

00:13:35.789 --> 00:13:37.639
an example of like the touch highlight
you know the opacity the color and so

00:13:37.639 --> 00:13:37.649
you know the opacity the color and so
 

00:13:37.649 --> 00:13:38.029
you know the opacity the color and so
forth

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:38.039
forth
 

00:13:38.039 --> 00:13:39.769
forth
so this is really kind of like the

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:39.779
so this is really kind of like the
 

00:13:39.779 --> 00:13:41.539
so this is really kind of like the
interface the designer has with a

00:13:41.539 --> 00:13:41.549
interface the designer has with a
 

00:13:41.549 --> 00:13:42.949
interface the designer has with a
developer right this is information a

00:13:42.949 --> 00:13:42.959
developer right this is information a
 

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:44.239
developer right this is information a
developer wants to know they want to

00:13:44.239 --> 00:13:44.249
developer wants to know they want to
 

00:13:44.249 --> 00:13:45.710
developer wants to know they want to
know there's no good just giving them a

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:45.720
know there's no good just giving them a
 

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.329
know there's no good just giving them a
PSD or something like that they want to

00:13:47.329 --> 00:13:47.339
PSD or something like that they want to
 

00:13:47.339 --> 00:13:50.179
PSD or something like that they want to
know things in dip sizes and can

00:13:50.179 --> 00:13:50.189
know things in dip sizes and can
 

00:13:50.189 --> 00:13:51.679
know things in dip sizes and can
absolutely colors and so on so they

00:13:51.679 --> 00:13:51.689
absolutely colors and so on so they
 

00:13:51.689 --> 00:13:53.539
absolutely colors and so on so they
don't have to go digging in to a PSD

00:13:53.539 --> 00:13:53.549
don't have to go digging in to a PSD
 

00:13:53.549 --> 00:13:55.489
don't have to go digging in to a PSD
files appliance information one of the

00:13:55.489 --> 00:13:55.499
files appliance information one of the
 

00:13:55.499 --> 00:13:57.019
files appliance information one of the
things that I find really useful is when

00:13:57.019 --> 00:13:57.029
things that I find really useful is when
 

00:13:57.029 --> 00:13:58.220
things that I find really useful is when
you're when you're creating a responsive

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:58.230
you're when you're creating a responsive
 

00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.409
you're when you're creating a responsive
design or something where you're

00:14:00.409 --> 00:14:00.419
design or something where you're
 

00:14:00.419 --> 00:14:02.809
design or something where you're
targeting multiple devices rather than

00:14:02.809 --> 00:14:02.819
targeting multiple devices rather than
 

00:14:02.819 --> 00:14:04.669
targeting multiple devices rather than
using potentially I matter know if this

00:14:04.669 --> 00:14:04.679
using potentially I matter know if this
 

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:05.929
using potentially I matter know if this
will actually work in practice but it's

00:14:05.929 --> 00:14:05.939
will actually work in practice but it's
 

00:14:05.939 --> 00:14:06.679
will actually work in practice but it's
definitely something that I've thought

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:06.689
definitely something that I've thought
 

00:14:06.689 --> 00:14:09.199
definitely something that I've thought
about before rather than using like for

00:14:09.199 --> 00:14:09.209
about before rather than using like for
 

00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:11.840
about before rather than using like for
dip or eight dip or sixteen dip here you

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:11.850
dip or eight dip or sixteen dip here you
 

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:14.539
dip or eight dip or sixteen dip here you
could say like small or medium or large

00:14:14.539 --> 00:14:14.549
could say like small or medium or large
 

00:14:14.549 --> 00:14:16.819
could say like small or medium or large
and then have like a lookup table saying

00:14:16.819 --> 00:14:16.829
and then have like a lookup table saying
 

00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:20.539
and then have like a lookup table saying
you know on phone size devices small is

00:14:20.539 --> 00:14:20.549
you know on phone size devices small is
 

00:14:20.549 --> 00:14:22.220
you know on phone size devices small is
this size medium is this size larger

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:22.230
this size medium is this size larger
 

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.949
this size medium is this size larger
this dies and then on let's say

00:14:24.949 --> 00:14:24.959
this dies and then on let's say
 

00:14:24.959 --> 00:14:27.139
this dies and then on let's say
seven-inch devices or once you have 600

00:14:27.139 --> 00:14:27.149
seven-inch devices or once you have 600
 

00:14:27.149 --> 00:14:29.569
seven-inch devices or once you have 600
dips of of horizontal space let's say

00:14:29.569 --> 00:14:29.579
dips of of horizontal space let's say
 

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:32.239
dips of of horizontal space let's say
you start bumping those up and having

00:14:32.239 --> 00:14:32.249
you start bumping those up and having
 

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:34.579
you start bumping those up and having
something like a lookup table we're

00:14:34.579 --> 00:14:34.589
something like a lookup table we're
 

00:14:34.589 --> 00:14:36.019
something like a lookup table we're
basically like this is small this is

00:14:36.019 --> 00:14:36.029
basically like this is small this is
 

00:14:36.029 --> 00:14:37.340
basically like this is small this is
normal this is large and so on and so

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:37.350
normal this is large and so on and so
 

00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:39.319
normal this is large and so on and so
forth that's actually really easy for

00:14:39.319 --> 00:14:39.329
forth that's actually really easy for
 

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:41.539
forth that's actually really easy for
developers to then take and map into

00:14:41.539 --> 00:14:41.549
developers to then take and map into
 

00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:43.639
developers to then take and map into
Dimensions files so you can literally

00:14:43.639 --> 00:14:43.649
Dimensions files so you can literally
 

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.979
Dimensions files so you can literally
just take that lookup table and create

00:14:45.979 --> 00:14:45.989
just take that lookup table and create
 

00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:48.529
just take that lookup table and create
you know xml files to specify the

00:14:48.529 --> 00:14:48.539
you know xml files to specify the
 

00:14:48.539 --> 00:14:50.319
you know xml files to specify the
dimensions and those in the

00:14:50.319 --> 00:14:50.329
dimensions and those in the
 

00:14:50.329 --> 00:14:52.030
dimensions and those in the
you could go and adjust the dimensions

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:52.040
you could go and adjust the dimensions
 

00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:53.410
you could go and adjust the dimensions
as well things like the tech size like

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:53.420
as well things like the tech size like
 

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.079
as well things like the tech size like
I've specified here is own 18 SP but

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:56.089
I've specified here is own 18 SP but
 

00:14:56.089 --> 00:14:57.999
I've specified here is own 18 SP but
that's kind of map store what we have is

00:14:57.999 --> 00:14:58.009
that's kind of map store what we have is
 

00:14:58.009 --> 00:15:00.129
that's kind of map store what we have is
this kind of text appearance medium is

00:15:00.129 --> 00:15:00.139
this kind of text appearance medium is
 

00:15:00.139 --> 00:15:02.289
this kind of text appearance medium is
this kind of standard text size and

00:15:02.289 --> 00:15:02.299
this kind of standard text size and
 

00:15:02.299 --> 00:15:04.900
this kind of standard text size and
that's 18 SP on some devices but it

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:04.910
that's 18 SP on some devices but it
 

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:06.400
that's 18 SP on some devices but it
could be larger on other devices you

00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:06.410
could be larger on other devices you
 

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:07.419
could be larger on other devices you
know in the flash which were more likely

00:15:07.419 --> 00:15:07.429
know in the flash which were more likely
 

00:15:07.429 --> 00:15:08.650
know in the flash which were more likely
to hold forever away but it could

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:08.660
to hold forever away but it could
 

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:10.539
to hold forever away but it could
actually be at a larger value so rather

00:15:10.539 --> 00:15:10.549
actually be at a larger value so rather
 

00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:12.400
actually be at a larger value so rather
than specifying anything any number I

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:12.410
than specifying anything any number I
 

00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:13.900
than specifying anything any number I
guess you could swap out for some kind

00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:13.910
guess you could swap out for some kind
 

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.299
guess you could swap out for some kind
of look of value right yeah all right

00:15:16.299 --> 00:15:16.309
of look of value right yeah all right
 

00:15:16.309 --> 00:15:19.539
of look of value right yeah all right
let's let's carry on to the navigation

00:15:19.539 --> 00:15:19.549
let's let's carry on to the navigation
 

00:15:19.549 --> 00:15:21.819
let's let's carry on to the navigation
drawer yeah so we didn't redo the whole

00:15:21.819 --> 00:15:21.829
drawer yeah so we didn't redo the whole
 

00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:23.769
drawer yeah so we didn't redo the whole
application we just looked at this one

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:23.779
application we just looked at this one
 

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:25.179
application we just looked at this one
screen but I didn't want to kind of pick

00:15:25.179 --> 00:15:25.189
screen but I didn't want to kind of pick
 

00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:27.249
screen but I didn't want to kind of pick
up on saying on an application drawer so

00:15:27.249 --> 00:15:27.259
up on saying on an application drawer so
 

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:30.069
up on saying on an application drawer so
and Rito's used it and they're kind of

00:15:30.069 --> 00:15:30.079
and Rito's used it and they're kind of
 

00:15:30.079 --> 00:15:31.389
and Rito's used it and they're kind of
like you know he's done a good

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:31.399
like you know he's done a good
 

00:15:31.399 --> 00:15:33.039
like you know he's done a good
subdivision of the different sections

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:33.049
subdivision of the different sections
 

00:15:33.049 --> 00:15:35.229
subdivision of the different sections
and but to me there was a couple

00:15:35.229 --> 00:15:35.239
and but to me there was a couple
 

00:15:35.239 --> 00:15:37.059
and but to me there was a couple
problems with it firstly like the

00:15:37.059 --> 00:15:37.069
problems with it firstly like the
 

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:39.519
problems with it firstly like the
individual navigation kind of items felt

00:15:39.519 --> 00:15:39.529
individual navigation kind of items felt
 

00:15:39.529 --> 00:15:40.989
individual navigation kind of items felt
a little bit in substantial so we think

00:15:40.989 --> 00:15:40.999
a little bit in substantial so we think
 

00:15:40.999 --> 00:15:42.039
a little bit in substantial so we think
like that this is that your major

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:42.049
like that this is that your major
 

00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:43.600
like that this is that your major
navigation within the application so I

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:43.610
navigation within the application so I
 

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:44.829
navigation within the application so I
wanted it to feel a little bit weightier

00:15:44.829 --> 00:15:44.839
wanted it to feel a little bit weightier
 

00:15:44.839 --> 00:15:47.259
wanted it to feel a little bit weightier
and and the other problem I felt was

00:15:47.259 --> 00:15:47.269
and and the other problem I felt was
 

00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:48.789
and and the other problem I felt was
there was no kind of an idea of

00:15:48.789 --> 00:15:48.799
there was no kind of an idea of
 

00:15:48.799 --> 00:15:50.919
there was no kind of an idea of
selection so if you currently currently

00:15:50.919 --> 00:15:50.929
selection so if you currently currently
 

00:15:50.929 --> 00:15:52.329
selection so if you currently currently
on one of those screens you know you

00:15:52.329 --> 00:15:52.339
on one of those screens you know you
 

00:15:52.339 --> 00:15:54.100
on one of those screens you know you
should go back to that yes this is where

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:54.110
should go back to that yes this is where
 

00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:57.639
should go back to that yes this is where
you are in the application and so this

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:57.649
you are in the application and so this
 

00:15:57.649 --> 00:15:59.049
you are in the application and so this
is what we did you know some very very

00:15:59.049 --> 00:15:59.059
is what we did you know some very very
 

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:01.629
is what we did you know some very very
easy visual tweaks we just change the

00:16:01.629 --> 00:16:01.639
easy visual tweaks we just change the
 

00:16:01.639 --> 00:16:03.699
easy visual tweaks we just change the
screen so and the first thing we did is

00:16:03.699 --> 00:16:03.709
screen so and the first thing we did is
 

00:16:03.709 --> 00:16:05.829
screen so and the first thing we did is
we changed the line height of each item

00:16:05.829 --> 00:16:05.839
we changed the line height of each item
 

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:07.929
we changed the line height of each item
and to pick up on the size of the action

00:16:07.929 --> 00:16:07.939
and to pick up on the size of the action
 

00:16:07.939 --> 00:16:10.389
and to pick up on the size of the action
bar so here on a phone size device is

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399
bar so here on a phone size device is
 

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:12.039
bar so here on a phone size device is
going to be 48 dips but on a larger

00:16:12.039 --> 00:16:12.049
going to be 48 dips but on a larger
 

00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:13.689
going to be 48 dips but on a larger
device that can't might grow up to like

00:16:13.689 --> 00:16:13.699
device that can't might grow up to like
 

00:16:13.699 --> 00:16:15.669
device that can't might grow up to like
56 steps for example but yeah this

00:16:15.669 --> 00:16:15.679
56 steps for example but yeah this
 

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.319
56 steps for example but yeah this
echoes that the height of the action bar

00:16:17.319 --> 00:16:17.329
echoes that the height of the action bar
 

00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:18.759
echoes that the height of the action bar
so it kind of falls into the natural

00:16:18.759 --> 00:16:18.769
so it kind of falls into the natural
 

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:20.530
so it kind of falls into the natural
rhythm of the screen and echoing the

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:20.540
rhythm of the screen and echoing the
 

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.350
rhythm of the screen and echoing the
system components and we then kind of

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:23.360
system components and we then kind of
 

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.079
system components and we then kind of
like borrowed from the star we picked up

00:16:26.079 --> 00:16:26.089
like borrowed from the star we picked up
 

00:16:26.089 --> 00:16:28.629
like borrowed from the star we picked up
for the and the screen title and use

00:16:28.629 --> 00:16:28.639
for the and the screen title and use
 

00:16:28.639 --> 00:16:31.509
for the and the screen title and use
this kind of like bold italic it's not

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519
this kind of like bold italic it's not
 

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:33.159
this kind of like bold italic it's not
the condensed version here just because

00:16:33.159 --> 00:16:33.169
the condensed version here just because
 

00:16:33.169 --> 00:16:35.169
the condensed version here just because
I didn't feel like you kind of sat quite

00:16:35.169 --> 00:16:35.179
I didn't feel like you kind of sat quite
 

00:16:35.179 --> 00:16:36.850
I didn't feel like you kind of sat quite
right and so this is just actually

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:36.860
right and so this is just actually
 

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:40.539
right and so this is just actually
Roboto medium italic yeah but yeah I

00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:40.549
Roboto medium italic yeah but yeah I
 

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:42.129
Roboto medium italic yeah but yeah I
think these items can I feel a bit

00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:42.139
think these items can I feel a bit
 

00:16:42.139 --> 00:16:42.729
think these items can I feel a bit
weight yeah

00:16:42.729 --> 00:16:42.739
weight yeah
 

00:16:42.739 --> 00:16:44.470
weight yeah
and we didn't actually go through and

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:44.480
and we didn't actually go through and
 

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:47.439
and we didn't actually go through and
create glyphs or find glyphs for this

00:16:47.439 --> 00:16:47.449
create glyphs or find glyphs for this
 

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:49.059
create glyphs or find glyphs for this
but I feel like having some kind of

00:16:49.059 --> 00:16:49.069
but I feel like having some kind of
 

00:16:49.069 --> 00:16:50.319
but I feel like having some kind of
iconography would also help with this

00:16:50.319 --> 00:16:50.329
iconography would also help with this
 

00:16:50.329 --> 00:16:51.119
iconography would also help with this
sense of place

00:16:51.119 --> 00:16:51.129
sense of place
 

00:16:51.129 --> 00:16:54.309
sense of place
yep and then we have a spec for the

00:16:54.309 --> 00:16:54.319
yep and then we have a spec for the
 

00:16:54.319 --> 00:16:55.689
yep and then we have a spec for the
navigation drawer you put together link

00:16:55.689 --> 00:16:55.699
navigation drawer you put together link
 

00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:57.729
navigation drawer you put together link
yeah exactly so I just want to call out

00:16:57.729 --> 00:16:57.739
yeah exactly so I just want to call out
 

00:16:57.739 --> 00:16:59.049
yeah exactly so I just want to call out
a few items here so this is how you

00:16:59.049 --> 00:16:59.059
a few items here so this is how you
 

00:16:59.059 --> 00:17:01.280
a few items here so this is how you
might expect this and

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:01.290
might expect this and
 

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.020
might expect this and
so one of the things we've done here is

00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:03.030
so one of the things we've done here is
 

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:04.370
so one of the things we've done here is
we followed our guidelines that a

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380
we followed our guidelines that a
 

00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:06.350
we followed our guidelines that a
navigation drawer should be it's between

00:17:06.350 --> 00:17:06.360
navigation drawer should be it's between
 

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.079
navigation drawer should be it's between
240 and 320 dips so we've we kind of

00:17:09.079 --> 00:17:09.089
240 and 320 dips so we've we kind of
 

00:17:09.089 --> 00:17:10.460
240 and 320 dips so we've we kind of
like call that out explicitly so it's

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:10.470
like call that out explicitly so it's
 

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:12.050
like call that out explicitly so it's
not going to grow too big and we've

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:12.060
not going to grow too big and we've
 

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:13.760
not going to grow too big and we've
called out things like the the drop

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:13.770
called out things like the the drop
 

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:16.490
called out things like the the drop
shadow to use like just to the right the

00:17:16.490 --> 00:17:16.500
shadow to use like just to the right the
 

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.990
shadow to use like just to the right the
draw it has a very subtle kind of like

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:18.000
draw it has a very subtle kind of like
 

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.150
draw it has a very subtle kind of like
free dip drop shadow variable Center P

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:20.160
free dip drop shadow variable Center P
 

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.790
free dip drop shadow variable Center P
and pasty so you know just calling out

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:22.800
and pasty so you know just calling out
 

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.870
and pasty so you know just calling out
all this kind of documentation that your

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880
all this kind of documentation that your
 

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.210
all this kind of documentation that your
developers can I'm gonna want to see and

00:17:26.210 --> 00:17:26.220
developers can I'm gonna want to see and
 

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.069
developers can I'm gonna want to see and
you can see they're actually kind of

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:28.079
you can see they're actually kind of
 

00:17:28.079 --> 00:17:30.080
you can see they're actually kind of
similar to how remember if you can zoom

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.090
similar to how remember if you can zoom
 

00:17:30.090 --> 00:17:31.880
similar to how remember if you can zoom
in on the big square there over

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:31.890
in on the big square there over
 

00:17:31.890 --> 00:17:34.280
in on the big square there over
countries icon and you know we specify

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:34.290
countries icon and you know we specify
 

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:36.380
countries icon and you know we specify
the kind of the icon frame area we've

00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:36.390
the kind of the icon frame area we've
 

00:17:36.390 --> 00:17:38.330
the kind of the icon frame area we've
got it 48 by 48 dip we've actually

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:38.340
got it 48 by 48 dip we've actually
 

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.980
got it 48 by 48 dip we've actually
specified there in brackets like you

00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:39.990
specified there in brackets like you
 

00:17:39.990 --> 00:17:41.210
specified there in brackets like you
should be the same height as the action

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220
should be the same height as the action
 

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:43.070
should be the same height as the action
bar so like a developer's going to see

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:43.080
bar so like a developer's going to see
 

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.740
bar so like a developer's going to see
that oh right yeah ok so I can see and I

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:45.750
that oh right yeah ok so I can see and I
 

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:48.890
that oh right yeah ok so I can see and I
should kind of assign that to the same

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900
should kind of assign that to the same
 

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.420
should kind of assign that to the same
height action bar so on a different

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:50.430
height action bar so on a different
 

00:17:50.430 --> 00:17:53.500
height action bar so on a different
device it might be a different size yep

00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:53.510
device it might be a different size yep
 

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:56.660
device it might be a different size yep
all right any parting thoughts for this

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:56.670
all right any parting thoughts for this
 

00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:00.980
all right any parting thoughts for this
design no really I don't let you say I

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:00.990
design no really I don't let you say I
 

00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.470
design no really I don't let you say I
think really good great job in the hard

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480
think really good great job in the hard
 

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.510
think really good great job in the hard
work of actually working out the kind of

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520
work of actually working out the kind of
 

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.490
work of actually working out the kind of
information design and we've just shown

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:07.500
information design and we've just shown
 

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.080
information design and we've just shown
a few easy techniques in order to kind

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:09.090
a few easy techniques in order to kind
 

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:12.470
a few easy techniques in order to kind
of communicate that better yeah I think

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480
of communicate that better yeah I think
 

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.420
of communicate that better yeah I think
you know reto started with with basic

00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:14.430
you know reto started with with basic
 

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.890
you know reto started with with basic
wireframes like you said the information

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:15.900
wireframes like you said the information
 

00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.780
wireframes like you said the information
architecture and then the process of

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:17.790
architecture and then the process of
 

00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:20.120
architecture and then the process of
taking that and creating you know medium

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:20.130
taking that and creating you know medium
 

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:22.130
taking that and creating you know medium
to high fidelity visual design Moxa's

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:22.140
to high fidelity visual design Moxa's
 

00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:24.050
to high fidelity visual design Moxa's
you know it's it's fairly simple I think

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:24.060
you know it's it's fairly simple I think
 

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:25.940
you know it's it's fairly simple I think
that you really start with the grid you

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:25.950
that you really start with the grid you
 

00:18:25.950 --> 00:18:27.710
that you really start with the grid you
then move on to things like typography

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720
then move on to things like typography
 

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.560
then move on to things like typography
color and so on but you know really once

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:30.570
color and so on but you know really once
 

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:32.330
color and so on but you know really once
you have the wireframes I think it it

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340
you have the wireframes I think it it
 

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.100
you have the wireframes I think it it
becomes a little pretty easy to put

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:34.110
becomes a little pretty easy to put
 

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:36.290
becomes a little pretty easy to put
together the visual design or not to not

00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:36.300
together the visual design or not to not
 

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:37.790
together the visual design or not to not
to trivialize all the work we did Nick

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:37.800
to trivialize all the work we did Nick
 

00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:42.850
to trivialize all the work we did Nick
but alright so let's move on to two maps

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:42.860
but alright so let's move on to two maps
 

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:46.490
but alright so let's move on to two maps
so Adam you take we've four Maps yeah so

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:46.500
so Adam you take we've four Maps yeah so
 

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.460
so Adam you take we've four Maps yeah so
let's talk about Google Maps Android the

00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:49.470
let's talk about Google Maps Android the
 

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.140
let's talk about Google Maps Android the
API version 2

00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:51.150
API version 2
 

00:18:51.150 --> 00:18:53.030
API version 2
so hopefully this doesn't need too much

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.040
so hopefully this doesn't need too much
 

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.860
so hopefully this doesn't need too much
of an introduction it was released last

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:54.870
of an introduction it was released last
 

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.380
of an introduction it was released last
year with great fanfare as an upgrade to

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:57.390
year with great fanfare as an upgrade to
 

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.860
year with great fanfare as an upgrade to
the original version of maps or map view

00:18:59.860 --> 00:18:59.870
the original version of maps or map view
 

00:18:59.870 --> 00:19:01.940
the original version of maps or map view
it's a it's a great API

00:19:01.940 --> 00:19:01.950
it's a it's a great API
 

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.870
it's a it's a great API
you know if you

00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880
you know if you
 

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.510
you know if you
an app that takes advantage of all that

00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520
an app that takes advantage of all that
 

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:07.700
an app that takes advantage of all that
needs to display content on a map it's

00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:07.710
needs to display content on a map it's
 

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:09.440
needs to display content on a map it's
definitely something you should use for

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:09.450
definitely something you should use for
 

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:11.120
definitely something you should use for
those of you who aren't familiar with it

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.130
those of you who aren't familiar with it
 

00:19:11.130 --> 00:19:14.030
those of you who aren't familiar with it
you know it's a very powerful API that

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:14.040
you know it's a very powerful API that
 

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:15.200
you know it's a very powerful API that
lets you sort of display these

00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:15.210
lets you sort of display these
 

00:19:15.210 --> 00:19:17.720
lets you sort of display these
vector-based map components in your

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:17.730
vector-based map components in your
 

00:19:17.730 --> 00:19:19.910
vector-based map components in your
application and the advantage of that is

00:19:19.910 --> 00:19:19.920
application and the advantage of that is
 

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.030
application and the advantage of that is
that well first of all there's technical

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:23.040
that well first of all there's technical
 

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.980
that well first of all there's technical
advantages to it but from a visual

00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:24.990
advantages to it but from a visual
 

00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:26.780
advantages to it but from a visual
perspective the user can actually pan

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:26.790
perspective the user can actually pan
 

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.920
perspective the user can actually pan
tilt rotate the camera as the user looks

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:30.930
tilt rotate the camera as the user looks
 

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:33.230
tilt rotate the camera as the user looks
at the map very easily and it's just a

00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240
at the map very easily and it's just a
 

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.540
at the map very easily and it's just a
really immersive interactive experience

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:35.550
really immersive interactive experience
 

00:19:35.550 --> 00:19:37.640
really immersive interactive experience
and they can see 3d building silhouettes

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:37.650
and they can see 3d building silhouettes
 

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:38.780
and they can see 3d building silhouettes
which is actually really good for

00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:38.790
which is actually really good for
 

00:19:38.790 --> 00:19:41.000
which is actually really good for
providing extra context for you know if

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:41.010
providing extra context for you know if
 

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:42.440
providing extra context for you know if
you're looking for an apartment or

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:42.450
you're looking for an apartment or
 

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.090
you're looking for an apartment or
looking for pizza places or something

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100
looking for pizza places or something
 

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.740
looking for pizza places or something
that's actually you know that extra bit

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:45.750
that's actually you know that extra bit
 

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.360
that's actually you know that extra bit
of context indigo it's a really neat

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:47.370
of context indigo it's a really neat
 

00:19:47.370 --> 00:19:49.610
of context indigo it's a really neat
feature I think it only happens when you

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:49.620
feature I think it only happens when you
 

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.770
feature I think it only happens when you
zoom to a certain zoom level and in some

00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:51.780
zoom to a certain zoom level and in some
 

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.170
zoom to a certain zoom level and in some
cities but yes it's really cool when you

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:54.180
cities but yes it's really cool when you
 

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:57.680
cities but yes it's really cool when you
see what's it I think one of my favorite

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:57.690
see what's it I think one of my favorite
 

00:19:57.690 --> 00:19:59.660
see what's it I think one of my favorite
changes in maps v2 is that I think in

00:19:59.660 --> 00:19:59.670
changes in maps v2 is that I think in
 

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:01.040
changes in maps v2 is that I think in
the Maps v1 there were some technical

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:01.050
the Maps v1 there were some technical
 

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.750
the Maps v1 there were some technical
limitations about how many maps you

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760
limitations about how many maps you
 

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.220
limitations about how many maps you
could have in your application and so on

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:04.230
could have in your application and so on
 

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:05.480
could have in your application and so on
and so forth so if you had developers

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.490
and so forth so if you had developers
 

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:07.460
and so forth so if you had developers
pushing back about their designs about

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:07.470
pushing back about their designs about
 

00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:09.380
pushing back about their designs about
where you can I can't include a map

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:09.390
where you can I can't include a map
 

00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.030
where you can I can't include a map
that's no longer the case of v2 you can

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.040
that's no longer the case of v2 you can
 

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.710
that's no longer the case of v2 you can
have kind of as many map objects and

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720
have kind of as many map objects and
 

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.630
have kind of as many map objects and
that's big or small and make them

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640
that's big or small and make them
 

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:16.760
that's big or small and make them
animate and move as you like so don't

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:16.770
animate and move as you like so don't
 

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:17.720
animate and move as you like so don't
take that for an answer

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:17.730
take that for an answer
 

00:20:17.730 --> 00:20:20.240
take that for an answer
yeah I think you're also referring to

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:20.250
yeah I think you're also referring to
 

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.800
yeah I think you're also referring to
map fragment there which literally using

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:21.810
map fragment there which literally using
 

00:20:21.810 --> 00:20:23.120
map fragment there which literally using
that as sort of a portion of the screen

00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:23.130
that as sort of a portion of the screen
 

00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:24.440
that as sort of a portion of the screen
rather than taking up the entire screen

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:24.450
rather than taking up the entire screen
 

00:20:24.450 --> 00:20:24.890
rather than taking up the entire screen
sir

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:24.900
sir
 

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:27.710
sir
yeah definitely great updates in the v2

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720
yeah definitely great updates in the v2
 

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.920
yeah definitely great updates in the v2
version of the Maps API so in terms of

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:30.930
version of the Maps API so in terms of
 

00:20:30.930 --> 00:20:32.750
version of the Maps API so in terms of
interacting with the map there's a few

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760
interacting with the map there's a few
 

00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.940
interacting with the map there's a few
sort of standard controls that come with

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:34.950
sort of standard controls that come with
 

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.970
sort of standard controls that come with
the API picture here you see the zoom

00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980
the API picture here you see the zoom
 

00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:40.970
the API picture here you see the zoom
controls compass and my location those

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:40.980
controls compass and my location those
 

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.400
controls compass and my location those
are sort of fixed in various corners of

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:43.410
are sort of fixed in various corners of
 

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.500
are sort of fixed in various corners of
the map if you enable them the zoom

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:45.510
the map if you enable them the zoom
 

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.940
the map if you enable them the zoom
controls is sort of always in the bottom

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:46.950
controls is sort of always in the bottom
 

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.730
controls is sort of always in the bottom
right the compass is in the top left and

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:49.740
right the compass is in the top left and
 

00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:51.170
right the compass is in the top left and
it's actually not always visible it's

00:20:51.170 --> 00:20:51.180
it's actually not always visible it's
 

00:20:51.180 --> 00:20:53.810
it's actually not always visible it's
only visible when the user rotates or

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:53.820
only visible when the user rotates or
 

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.430
only visible when the user rotates or
sort of moves the map away from the

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440
sort of moves the map away from the
 

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.540
sort of moves the map away from the
default angle or rotation and then

00:20:59.540 --> 00:20:59.550
default angle or rotation and then
 

00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:00.980
default angle or rotation and then
there's my location button which is in

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:00.990
there's my location button which is in
 

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:03.290
there's my location button which is in
the top right corner normally and of

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:03.300
the top right corner normally and of
 

00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:04.640
the top right corner normally and of
course these can all be toggled on and

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:04.650
course these can all be toggled on and
 

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.490
course these can all be toggled on and
off and you can also create your own UI

00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500
off and you can also create your own UI
 

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.350
off and you can also create your own UI
controls if you want as well these are

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360
controls if you want as well these are
 

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.060
controls if you want as well these are
just the standard ones

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:11.070
just the standard ones
 

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:13.220
just the standard ones
and then there's also some standard

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:13.230
and then there's also some standard
 

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:15.769
and then there's also some standard
mapping gestures that can use zooming in

00:21:15.769 --> 00:21:15.779
mapping gestures that can use zooming in
 

00:21:15.779 --> 00:21:18.499
mapping gestures that can use zooming in
you know obviously pinch zoom is a is a

00:21:18.499 --> 00:21:18.509
you know obviously pinch zoom is a is a
 

00:21:18.509 --> 00:21:20.240
you know obviously pinch zoom is a is a
standard gesture for zooming and on the

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:20.250
standard gesture for zooming and on the
 

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:22.759
standard gesture for zooming and on the
map or zooming out scrolling or panning

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:22.769
map or zooming out scrolling or panning
 

00:21:22.769 --> 00:21:24.879
map or zooming out scrolling or panning
just by touching the screen and dragging

00:21:24.879 --> 00:21:24.889
just by touching the screen and dragging
 

00:21:24.889 --> 00:21:27.619
just by touching the screen and dragging
tilting is using two fingers to drag up

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:27.629
tilting is using two fingers to drag up
 

00:21:27.629 --> 00:21:30.259
tilting is using two fingers to drag up
and down rotate two fingers to rotate

00:21:30.259 --> 00:21:30.269
and down rotate two fingers to rotate
 

00:21:30.269 --> 00:21:31.490
and down rotate two fingers to rotate
around these are sort of pretty standard

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:31.500
around these are sort of pretty standard
 

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.950
around these are sort of pretty standard
things that you've probably already

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:33.960
things that you've probably already
 

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:41.180
things that you've probably already
experienced when using maps so in terms

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:41.190
experienced when using maps so in terms
 

00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:43.789
experienced when using maps so in terms
of customizing the map there's two main

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799
of customizing the map there's two main
 

00:21:43.799 --> 00:21:44.869
of customizing the map there's two main
components that you can sort of

00:21:44.869 --> 00:21:44.879
components that you can sort of
 

00:21:44.879 --> 00:21:46.970
components that you can sort of
customize well there's a few others but

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:46.980
customize well there's a few others but
 

00:21:46.980 --> 00:21:49.039
customize well there's a few others but
the main ones here are markers and info

00:21:49.039 --> 00:21:49.049
the main ones here are markers and info
 

00:21:49.049 --> 00:21:51.529
the main ones here are markers and info
windows so markers are the actual little

00:21:51.529 --> 00:21:51.539
windows so markers are the actual little
 

00:21:51.539 --> 00:21:52.909
windows so markers are the actual little
markers that drop down on the map to

00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919
markers that drop down on the map to
 

00:21:52.919 --> 00:21:55.879
markers that drop down on the map to
indicate a location and info windows are

00:21:55.879 --> 00:21:55.889
indicate a location and info windows are
 

00:21:55.889 --> 00:21:57.799
indicate a location and info windows are
those little dialog boxes which pop up

00:21:57.799 --> 00:21:57.809
those little dialog boxes which pop up
 

00:21:57.809 --> 00:21:59.600
those little dialog boxes which pop up
normally when you touch one of those

00:21:59.600 --> 00:21:59.610
normally when you touch one of those
 

00:21:59.610 --> 00:22:02.629
normally when you touch one of those
markers so obviously the default ones

00:22:02.629 --> 00:22:02.639
markers so obviously the default ones
 

00:22:02.639 --> 00:22:04.999
markers so obviously the default ones
are kind of plain and boring you should

00:22:04.999 --> 00:22:05.009
are kind of plain and boring you should
 

00:22:05.009 --> 00:22:06.980
are kind of plain and boring you should
almost always customize these to fit you

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:06.990
almost always customize these to fit you
 

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.919
almost always customize these to fit you
up appropriately the info window is they

00:22:09.919 --> 00:22:09.929
up appropriately the info window is they
 

00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:12.529
up appropriately the info window is they
do support layouts but they're very

00:22:12.529 --> 00:22:12.539
do support layouts but they're very
 

00:22:12.539 --> 00:22:15.039
do support layouts but they're very
static so for the developers out there

00:22:15.039 --> 00:22:15.049
static so for the developers out there
 

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:17.240
static so for the developers out there
you'll find that you can't actually make

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:17.250
you'll find that you can't actually make
 

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:19.310
you'll find that you can't actually make
some dynamic updates those views it

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320
some dynamic updates those views it
 

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.539
some dynamic updates those views it
really just draws it once and then

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:20.549
really just draws it once and then
 

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:21.950
really just draws it once and then
you're sort of stuck with that until you

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960
you're sort of stuck with that until you
 

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.289
you're sort of stuck with that until you
riad them again and I think we've got

00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299
riad them again and I think we've got
 

00:22:24.299 --> 00:22:26.299
riad them again and I think we've got
some more information and well the one

00:22:26.299 --> 00:22:26.309
some more information and well the one
 

00:22:26.309 --> 00:22:27.470
some more information and well the one
thing I wanted to mention was touch

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480
thing I wanted to mention was touch
 

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.570
thing I wanted to mention was touch
targets so when we were designing the

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:29.580
targets so when we were designing the
 

00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:31.369
targets so when we were designing the
Google i/o app which you see pictured

00:22:31.369 --> 00:22:31.379
Google i/o app which you see pictured
 

00:22:31.379 --> 00:22:32.840
Google i/o app which you see pictured
here we're actually thinking oh can we

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:32.850
here we're actually thinking oh can we
 

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.610
here we're actually thinking oh can we
have an info window that has like a

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:34.620
have an info window that has like a
 

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.799
have an info window that has like a
primary target and then like a secondary

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:36.809
primary target and then like a secondary
 

00:22:36.809 --> 00:22:38.990
primary target and then like a secondary
Seymour target and unfortunately the

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:39.000
Seymour target and unfortunately the
 

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.659
Seymour target and unfortunately the
current limitation is that no the entire

00:22:41.659 --> 00:22:41.669
current limitation is that no the entire
 

00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:44.060
current limitation is that no the entire
info window is a single touch target and

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:44.070
info window is a single touch target and
 

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.889
info window is a single touch target and
there's no real way to customize that so

00:22:45.889 --> 00:22:45.899
there's no real way to customize that so
 

00:22:45.899 --> 00:22:47.720
there's no real way to customize that so
there's no way to have like a like a

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:47.730
there's no way to have like a like a
 

00:22:47.730 --> 00:22:50.269
there's no way to have like a like a
button to the top right or or like a

00:22:50.269 --> 00:22:50.279
button to the top right or or like a
 

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.129
button to the top right or or like a
separate kind of section in that info

00:22:52.129 --> 00:22:52.139
separate kind of section in that info
 

00:22:52.139 --> 00:22:53.659
separate kind of section in that info
window that takes you all swear so just

00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:53.669
window that takes you all swear so just
 

00:22:53.669 --> 00:22:55.909
window that takes you all swear so just
plan for that and keep things simple it

00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919
plan for that and keep things simple it
 

00:22:55.919 --> 00:22:58.070
plan for that and keep things simple it
does kind of help and help simplify the

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:58.080
does kind of help and help simplify the
 

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:00.200
does kind of help and help simplify the
interaction model for the map but it is

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:00.210
interaction model for the map but it is
 

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:01.879
interaction model for the map but it is
a current limitation this is a good

00:23:01.879 --> 00:23:01.889
a current limitation this is a good
 

00:23:01.889 --> 00:23:03.490
a current limitation this is a good
example in the

00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:03.500
example in the
 

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.560
example in the
of customizing the info windows so you

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:05.570
of customizing the info windows so you
 

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.990
of customizing the info windows so you
can see here the Android track is

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000
can see here the Android track is
 

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.460
can see here the Android track is
selected and we've got the sort of nice

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:09.470
selected and we've got the sort of nice
 

00:23:09.470 --> 00:23:11.920
selected and we've got the sort of nice
green highlight faded there with the

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:11.930
green highlight faded there with the
 

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.930
green highlight faded there with the
little Android icon in the top right and

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:13.940
little Android icon in the top right and
 

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:15.400
little Android icon in the top right and
just for the developers in the audience

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:15.410
just for the developers in the audience
 

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.600
just for the developers in the audience
what basically happens is you can

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:16.610
what basically happens is you can
 

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:19.540
what basically happens is you can
provide your own layout but what the map

00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:19.550
provide your own layout but what the map
 

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:21.310
provide your own layout but what the map
component will do is it'll take a

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:21.320
component will do is it'll take a
 

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.890
component will do is it'll take a
snapshot of that layout it'll actually

00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:23.900
snapshot of that layout it'll actually
 

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:26.080
snapshot of that layout it'll actually
draw it lay it out and so on it'll take

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:26.090
draw it lay it out and so on it'll take
 

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:28.240
draw it lay it out and so on it'll take
a snapshot and then use that that bitmap

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:28.250
a snapshot and then use that that bitmap
 

00:23:28.250 --> 00:23:31.030
a snapshot and then use that that bitmap
snapshot to render the info window so

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:31.040
snapshot to render the info window so
 

00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:33.220
snapshot to render the info window so
it's not actually like a textview and

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:33.230
it's not actually like a textview and
 

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:34.990
it's not actually like a textview and
another texture and so on it's really

00:23:34.990 --> 00:23:35.000
another texture and so on it's really
 

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.270
another texture and so on it's really
just like a snapshot it's an imbecilic

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280
just like a snapshot it's an imbecilic
 

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.400
just like a snapshot it's an imbecilic
old roll at the end of the output is it

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.410
old roll at the end of the output is it
 

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:43.210
old roll at the end of the output is it
just displays exactly yeah you want to

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:43.220
just displays exactly yeah you want to
 

00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:46.420
just displays exactly yeah you want to
talk a bit about yeah so some a couple

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:46.430
talk a bit about yeah so some a couple
 

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.430
talk a bit about yeah so some a couple
of you know ideas for marker visual

00:23:48.430 --> 00:23:48.440
of you know ideas for marker visual
 

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.020
of you know ideas for marker visual
design there's really two types of

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:50.030
design there's really two types of
 

00:23:50.030 --> 00:23:51.970
design there's really two types of
markers that you can have and I guess

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:51.980
markers that you can have and I guess
 

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.560
markers that you can have and I guess
you can you can use whatever shapes you

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:53.570
you can you can use whatever shapes you
 

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.720
you can you can use whatever shapes you
want you know if you have let's say a

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:55.730
want you know if you have let's say a
 

00:23:55.730 --> 00:23:57.610
want you know if you have let's say a
person on a map obviously if I want to

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:57.620
person on a map obviously if I want to
 

00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:59.200
person on a map obviously if I want to
use their avatar in there somewhere and

00:23:59.200 --> 00:23:59.210
use their avatar in there somewhere and
 

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.880
use their avatar in there somewhere and
then that'll guide some of the shapes

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:00.890
then that'll guide some of the shapes
 

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:03.310
then that'll guide some of the shapes
but if it's just a very basic marker

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:03.320
but if it's just a very basic marker
 

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.370
but if it's just a very basic marker
that indicates something a couple of I

00:24:06.370 --> 00:24:06.380
that indicates something a couple of I
 

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:08.230
that indicates something a couple of I
guess a couple of suggestions the first

00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240
guess a couple of suggestions the first
 

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.720
guess a couple of suggestions the first
is to try to use your brand accent color

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:10.730
is to try to use your brand accent color
 

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.460
is to try to use your brand accent color
so just as you would use your accent

00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:12.470
so just as you would use your accent
 

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:14.800
so just as you would use your accent
color and the action bar or for like

00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:14.810
color and the action bar or for like
 

00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:16.960
color and the action bar or for like
list section headers or you know subtle

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:16.970
list section headers or you know subtle
 

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.850
list section headers or you know subtle
accents throughout definitely keep using

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:18.860
accents throughout definitely keep using
 

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.120
accents throughout definitely keep using
that here in your monitor images and I

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:22.130
that here in your monitor images and I
 

00:24:22.130 --> 00:24:23.380
that here in your monitor images and I
think that will we'll probably able to

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.390
think that will we'll probably able to
 

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.750
think that will we'll probably able to
share a PSD kind of template for this

00:24:25.750 --> 00:24:25.760
share a PSD kind of template for this
 

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:28.000
share a PSD kind of template for this
kind of thing at some point but here's

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.010
kind of thing at some point but here's
 

00:24:28.010 --> 00:24:30.070
kind of thing at some point but here's
an example from the i/o app we actually

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:30.080
an example from the i/o app we actually
 

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:31.650
an example from the i/o app we actually
didn't use this one on the right here

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:31.660
didn't use this one on the right here
 

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:34.180
didn't use this one on the right here
but we did use this where basically the

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:34.190
but we did use this where basically the
 

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.980
but we did use this where basically the
marker ends up just being white since we

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:35.990
marker ends up just being white since we
 

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.350
marker ends up just being white since we
know the background is colored and then

00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:38.360
know the background is colored and then
 

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:40.900
know the background is colored and then
we use the standard Google i/o purple or

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:40.910
we use the standard Google i/o purple or
 

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:44.170
we use the standard Google i/o purple or
blue to red gradient as as one of the

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:44.180
blue to red gradient as as one of the
 

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:46.600
blue to red gradient as as one of the
items within the marker image so it

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:46.610
items within the marker image so it
 

00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:48.850
items within the marker image so it
helps to kind of further that that

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:48.860
helps to kind of further that that
 

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.980
helps to kind of further that that
message of brand consistency throughout

00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:50.990
message of brand consistency throughout
 

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:53.980
message of brand consistency throughout
the app another thing I wanted to

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:53.990
the app another thing I wanted to
 

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:56.620
the app another thing I wanted to
mention is around density so if you have

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:56.630
mention is around density so if you have
 

00:24:56.630 --> 00:24:58.360
mention is around density so if you have
a lot of markers this is one of the

00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:58.370
a lot of markers this is one of the
 

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.370
a lot of markers this is one of the
things that I pet peeves I guess when

00:25:00.370 --> 00:25:00.380
things that I pet peeves I guess when
 

00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.630
things that I pet peeves I guess when
you open up like a let's say a real

00:25:01.630 --> 00:25:01.640
you open up like a let's say a real
 

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:03.970
you open up like a let's say a real
estate search app or a pizza search or

00:25:03.970 --> 00:25:03.980
estate search app or a pizza search or
 

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.890
estate search app or a pizza search or
whatever and there's like you know

00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:05.900
whatever and there's like you know
 

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.170
whatever and there's like you know
hundreds of results and all you see are

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:08.180
hundreds of results and all you see are
 

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.580
hundreds of results and all you see are
just these these

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:09.590
just these these
 

00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:13.000
just these these
yeah sea of markers it's not that useful

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:13.010
yeah sea of markers it's not that useful
 

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.830
yeah sea of markers it's not that useful
right you can no longer see the map you

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840
right you can no longer see the map you
 

00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.870
right you can no longer see the map you
kind of lose the whole point of having a

00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880
kind of lose the whole point of having a
 

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.400
kind of lose the whole point of having a
map there it's just kind of like a whole

00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:18.410
map there it's just kind of like a whole
 

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.900
map there it's just kind of like a whole
bunch of you know people standing in a

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:19.910
bunch of you know people standing in a
 

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.670
bunch of you know people standing in a
crowd and you can't really make out any

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:21.680
crowd and you can't really make out any
 

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.550
crowd and you can't really make out any
one of them so for those cases you may

00:25:24.550 --> 00:25:24.560
one of them so for those cases you may
 

00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.730
one of them so for those cases you may
want to use a smaller marker and the

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:27.740
want to use a smaller marker and the
 

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:29.080
want to use a smaller marker and the
point here is not to actually have a

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:29.090
point here is not to actually have a
 

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:30.550
point here is not to actually have a
smaller touch target the touch target

00:25:30.550 --> 00:25:30.560
smaller touch target the touch target
 

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.140
smaller touch target the touch target
should still really be kind of the same

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:32.150
should still really be kind of the same
 

00:25:32.150 --> 00:25:34.540
should still really be kind of the same
size maybe a little smaller you know

00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:34.550
size maybe a little smaller you know
 

00:25:34.550 --> 00:25:37.750
size maybe a little smaller you know
like this entire or I guess all around

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:37.760
like this entire or I guess all around
 

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.870
like this entire or I guess all around
this one for example this marker should

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880
this one for example this marker should
 

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:42.550
this one for example this marker should
be like a touch region that touching

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:42.560
be like a touch region that touching
 

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:46.150
be like a touch region that touching
that you know actually triggers it but

00:25:46.150 --> 00:25:46.160
that you know actually triggers it but
 

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.770
that you know actually triggers it but
the idea here is that you know it

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:47.780
the idea here is that you know it
 

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.060
the idea here is that you know it
doesn't really matter if you

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.070
doesn't really matter if you
 

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.800
doesn't really matter if you
accidentally click the wrong one what

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:50.810
accidentally click the wrong one what
 

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.270
accidentally click the wrong one what
you what the user would do is be able to

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:52.280
you what the user would do is be able to
 

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.000
you what the user would do is be able to
zoom in to see more information about

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.010
zoom in to see more information about
 

00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:58.270
zoom in to see more information about
that area and once the markers these

00:25:58.270 --> 00:25:58.280
that area and once the markers these
 

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.490
that area and once the markers these
smaller markers are well separated out

00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:00.500
smaller markers are well separated out
 

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.710
smaller markers are well separated out
then there will be kind of no ambiguity

00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:02.720
then there will be kind of no ambiguity
 

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.540
then there will be kind of no ambiguity
in terms of which one you clicked so the

00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:04.550
in terms of which one you clicked so the
 

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:07.000
in terms of which one you clicked so the
idea is you know use smaller markers

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:07.010
idea is you know use smaller markers
 

00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:09.640
idea is you know use smaller markers
purely for the purpose of seeing the map

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:09.650
purely for the purpose of seeing the map
 

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:11.290
purely for the purpose of seeing the map
underneath because like we said before

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:11.300
underneath because like we said before
 

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:13.210
underneath because like we said before
actually like what was said in one of

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:13.220
actually like what was said in one of
 

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.700
actually like what was said in one of
the slides there was the map is our

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:15.710
the slides there was the map is our
 

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.220
the slides there was the map is our
Chanel later on the map is the UI right

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:18.230
Chanel later on the map is the UI right
 

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:19.780
Chanel later on the map is the UI right
like the whole context the whole

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:19.790
like the whole context the whole
 

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:21.940
like the whole context the whole
interface for the user is the map it's

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:21.950
interface for the user is the map it's
 

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.040
interface for the user is the map it's
the geographic context so you don't want

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:24.050
the geographic context so you don't want
 

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.880
the geographic context so you don't want
to obscure that with too many markers

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:26.890
to obscure that with too many markers
 

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:29.830
to obscure that with too many markers
and speaking of that if you you know the

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:29.840
and speaking of that if you you know the
 

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.270
and speaking of that if you you know the
maps not going to provide the clustering

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:31.280
maps not going to provide the clustering
 

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.010
maps not going to provide the clustering
kind of algorithm for you because we

00:26:33.010 --> 00:26:33.020
kind of algorithm for you because we
 

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.480
kind of algorithm for you because we
leave that to you you probably know more

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.490
leave that to you you probably know more
 

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:35.920
leave that to you you probably know more
about the information and how to cluster

00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:35.930
about the information and how to cluster
 

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:37.990
about the information and how to cluster
yourself but you want to have an example

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000
yourself but you want to have an example
 

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.370
yourself but you want to have an example
of how we do clustering there's a great

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:39.380
of how we do clustering there's a great
 

00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.800
of how we do clustering there's a great
and blog post called too many markers

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:41.810
and blog post called too many markers
 

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:44.620
and blog post called too many markers
and from the Google Maps team describing

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:44.630
and from the Google Maps team describing
 

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.510
and from the Google Maps team describing
how we do clustering so the developers

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520
how we do clustering so the developers
 

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.830
how we do clustering so the developers
out there who want to implement that at

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840
out there who want to implement that at
 

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.280
out there who want to implement that at
Google for too many markers cool all

right all right moving on

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:54.070
right all right moving on
 

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.580
right all right moving on
so changing the view as I mentioned

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:56.590
so changing the view as I mentioned
 

00:26:56.590 --> 00:26:58.650
so changing the view as I mentioned
before you've got a lot of control

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:58.660
before you've got a lot of control
 

00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.390
before you've got a lot of control
around how the sort of user is viewing

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:00.400
around how the sort of user is viewing
 

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.340
around how the sort of user is viewing
the perspective that it uses viewing the

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:02.350
the perspective that it uses viewing the
 

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:05.100
the perspective that it uses viewing the
map basically the camera angle the users

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.110
map basically the camera angle the users
 

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:07.380
map basically the camera angle the users
viewing the map on and actually the Maps

00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:07.390
viewing the map on and actually the Maps
 

00:27:07.390 --> 00:27:08.910
viewing the map on and actually the Maps
API makes it really really easy to

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:08.920
API makes it really really easy to
 

00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.270
API makes it really really easy to
animate the camera between locations you

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:12.280
animate the camera between locations you
 

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.280
animate the camera between locations you
know basically animate the location zoom

00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:14.290
know basically animate the location zoom
 

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:16.050
know basically animate the location zoom
bearing and tilt all these different

00:27:16.050 --> 00:27:16.060
bearing and tilt all these different
 

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.290
bearing and tilt all these different
things and actually it does it by just

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:19.300
things and actually it does it by just
 

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:20.820
things and actually it does it by just
sending an extra flag it will animate

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:20.830
sending an extra flag it will animate
 

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.920
sending an extra flag it will animate
between two locations and this is really

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:22.930
between two locations and this is really
 

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:26.340
between two locations and this is really
useful for sort of giving user a sort of

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:26.350
useful for sort of giving user a sort of
 

00:27:26.350 --> 00:27:28.110
useful for sort of giving user a sort of
way of illustrating that the the

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120
way of illustrating that the the
 

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.690
way of illustrating that the the
difference between two locations so for

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:30.700
difference between two locations so for
 

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:32.100
difference between two locations so for
example if you're viewing something in

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:32.110
example if you're viewing something in
 

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:33.870
example if you're viewing something in
New York you want to jump across the

00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880
New York you want to jump across the
 

00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.700
New York you want to jump across the
London the map will very quickly zoom

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:35.710
London the map will very quickly zoom
 

00:27:35.710 --> 00:27:38.580
London the map will very quickly zoom
out swing across the London and sort of

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:38.590
out swing across the London and sort of
 

00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:41.970
out swing across the London and sort of
give you this very easy mental spatial

00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:41.980
give you this very easy mental spatial
 

00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:43.740
give you this very easy mental spatial
idea that you've moved a very long

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:43.750
idea that you've moved a very long
 

00:27:43.750 --> 00:27:47.340
idea that you've moved a very long
distance across the map and I guess one

00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:47.350
distance across the map and I guess one
 

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:48.990
distance across the map and I guess one
point to mention that is is that you

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000
point to mention that is is that you
 

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:50.460
point to mention that is is that you
shouldn't you don't need to always pan

00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:50.470
shouldn't you don't need to always pan
 

00:27:50.470 --> 00:27:52.520
shouldn't you don't need to always pan
the map if there's tons of different

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:52.530
the map if there's tons of different
 

00:27:52.530 --> 00:27:55.410
the map if there's tons of different
infinitives around so that will mean

00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:55.420
infinitives around so that will mean
 

00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:56.910
infinitives around so that will mean
that the touch targets where the users

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:56.920
that the touch targets where the users
 

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.050
that the touch targets where the users
trying to touch the map will keep

00:27:58.050 --> 00:27:58.060
trying to touch the map will keep
 

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.480
trying to touch the map will keep
shifting from underneath them so in

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:00.490
shifting from underneath them so in
 

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:02.220
shifting from underneath them so in
those particular cases you may want to

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:02.230
those particular cases you may want to
 

00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:04.080
those particular cases you may want to
sort of minimize the amount that the map

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:04.090
sort of minimize the amount that the map
 

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:06.960
sort of minimize the amount that the map
moves around but in most other cases it

00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:06.970
moves around but in most other cases it
 

00:28:06.970 --> 00:28:08.640
moves around but in most other cases it
can be useful to show these animations

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:08.650
can be useful to show these animations
 

00:28:08.650 --> 00:28:10.530
can be useful to show these animations
between locations yeah and I think

00:28:10.530 --> 00:28:10.540
between locations yeah and I think
 

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.840
between locations yeah and I think
there's I think with the API there's no

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:12.850
there's I think with the API there's no
 

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.570
there's I think with the API there's no
automatic panning behavior so you can

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:15.580
automatic panning behavior so you can
 

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:16.860
automatic panning behavior so you can
definitely customize you know what

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:16.870
definitely customize you know what
 

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:18.210
definitely customize you know what
happens when you when you touch

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:18.220
happens when you when you touch
 

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:19.800
happens when you when you touch
something but really you know that point

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:19.810
something but really you know that point
 

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.300
something but really you know that point
I can't mention it enough it's it's the

00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.310
I can't mention it enough it's it's the
 

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.890
I can't mention it enough it's it's the
you know one of my other pet peeves I'd

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:22.900
you know one of my other pet peeves I'd
 

00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.830
you know one of my other pet peeves I'd
say is when you touch like a marker

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840
say is when you touch like a marker
 

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:27.960
say is when you touch like a marker
that's kind of like just off-center and

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:27.970
that's kind of like just off-center and
 

00:28:27.970 --> 00:28:30.450
that's kind of like just off-center and
then it resent there's the whole thing

00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:30.460
then it resent there's the whole thing
 

00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:33.240
then it resent there's the whole thing
and like everything else shifts around

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.250
and like everything else shifts around
 

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:35.550
and like everything else shifts around
underneath you and I mean obviously the

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:35.560
underneath you and I mean obviously the
 

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.320
underneath you and I mean obviously the
animation helps maintain that context

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:37.330
animation helps maintain that context
 

00:28:37.330 --> 00:28:39.600
animation helps maintain that context
but it would still just be much better

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:39.610
but it would still just be much better
 

00:28:39.610 --> 00:28:41.070
but it would still just be much better
if you just kind of kept things in place

00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080
if you just kind of kept things in place
 

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.490
if you just kind of kept things in place
only moving the the map as much as you

00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:44.500
only moving the the map as much as you
 

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.800
only moving the the map as much as you
need just to show the content yes if you

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:46.810
need just to show the content yes if you
 

00:28:46.810 --> 00:28:49.560
need just to show the content yes if you
touch like so if you tap the marker like

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:49.570
touch like so if you tap the marker like
 

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:50.760
touch like so if you tap the marker like
maybe the edge of the screen then you

00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:50.770
maybe the edge of the screen then you
 

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:51.820
maybe the edge of the screen then you
may want to pen

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:51.830
may want to pen
 

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.950
may want to pen
but if as roman saying it's just

00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960
but if as roman saying it's just
 

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.509
but if as roman saying it's just
off-center it may not make sense yeah

00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519
off-center it may not make sense yeah
 

00:28:55.519 --> 00:28:57.310
off-center it may not make sense yeah
alright let's let's move through since

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.320
alright let's let's move through since
 

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.779
alright let's let's move through since
we're running okay the most important

00:28:58.779 --> 00:28:58.789
we're running okay the most important
 

00:28:58.789 --> 00:29:01.149
we're running okay the most important
slides will have no time yeah so a

00:29:01.149 --> 00:29:01.159
slides will have no time yeah so a
 

00:29:01.159 --> 00:29:03.759
slides will have no time yeah so a
full-screen map or a large map the

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:03.769
full-screen map or a large map the
 

00:29:03.769 --> 00:29:05.649
full-screen map or a large map the
reason why I say large map here is just

00:29:05.649 --> 00:29:05.659
reason why I say large map here is just
 

00:29:05.659 --> 00:29:07.509
reason why I say large map here is just
because if you're on a larger screen

00:29:07.509 --> 00:29:07.519
because if you're on a larger screen
 

00:29:07.519 --> 00:29:09.370
because if you're on a larger screen
device it may not actually be a full

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:09.380
device it may not actually be a full
 

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.470
device it may not actually be a full
screen map and may sort of taking up the

00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480
screen map and may sort of taking up the
 

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.759
screen map and may sort of taking up the
majority of the screen but not all the

00:29:12.759 --> 00:29:12.769
majority of the screen but not all the
 

00:29:12.769 --> 00:29:15.009
majority of the screen but not all the
screens so in this particular case the

00:29:15.009 --> 00:29:15.019
screens so in this particular case the
 

00:29:15.019 --> 00:29:17.320
screens so in this particular case the
map is really the interface here you

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:17.330
map is really the interface here you
 

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:18.610
map is really the interface here you
should really allow you know panning

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:18.620
should really allow you know panning
 

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.549
should really allow you know panning
tilting zooming rotating not allowing

00:29:21.549 --> 00:29:21.559
tilting zooming rotating not allowing
 

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:23.049
tilting zooming rotating not allowing
those it's kind of unexpected to the

00:29:23.049 --> 00:29:23.059
those it's kind of unexpected to the
 

00:29:23.059 --> 00:29:25.180
those it's kind of unexpected to the
user they're sort of be expecting to be

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:25.190
user they're sort of be expecting to be
 

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:27.700
user they're sort of be expecting to be
able to do all of those things and of

00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:27.710
able to do all of those things and of
 

00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:28.840
able to do all of those things and of
course you should be minimizing UI

00:29:28.840 --> 00:29:28.850
course you should be minimizing UI
 

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:32.259
course you should be minimizing UI
distraction now one thing that we've

00:29:32.259 --> 00:29:32.269
distraction now one thing that we've
 

00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:34.360
distraction now one thing that we've
recommended in the past is using the

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:34.370
recommended in the past is using the
 

00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:36.100
recommended in the past is using the
action about overlay mode so adding some

00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:36.110
action about overlay mode so adding some
 

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:38.649
action about overlay mode so adding some
transparency there to the action bar and

00:29:38.649 --> 00:29:38.659
transparency there to the action bar and
 

00:29:38.659 --> 00:29:39.970
transparency there to the action bar and
this is actually from one of our first

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:39.980
this is actually from one of our first
 

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.690
this is actually from one of our first
episodes of Android design in action

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:42.700
episodes of Android design in action
 

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:47.440
episodes of Android design in action
that we did a very long back now I will

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:47.450
that we did a very long back now I will
 

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.389
that we did a very long back now I will
note that it's it's a great thing that

00:29:49.389 --> 00:29:49.399
note that it's it's a great thing that
 

00:29:49.399 --> 00:29:52.690
note that it's it's a great thing that
you can enable if possible there is a I

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:52.700
you can enable if possible there is a I
 

00:29:52.700 --> 00:29:54.610
you can enable if possible there is a I
guess a minor issue with it from a

00:29:54.610 --> 00:29:54.620
guess a minor issue with it from a
 

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.610
guess a minor issue with it from a
technical aspect perspective in that the

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:57.620
technical aspect perspective in that the
 

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:00.940
technical aspect perspective in that the
Maps API will actually show the UI

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:00.950
Maps API will actually show the UI
 

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:03.460
Maps API will actually show the UI
controls underneath the action bar

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:03.470
controls underneath the action bar
 

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.680
controls underneath the action bar
potentially because it doesn't actually

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:05.690
potentially because it doesn't actually
 

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:07.659
potentially because it doesn't actually
relay out those UI controls in some

00:30:07.659 --> 00:30:07.669
relay out those UI controls in some
 

00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:10.269
relay out those UI controls in some
cases when you engage the overlay mode

00:30:10.269 --> 00:30:10.279
cases when you engage the overlay mode
 

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:12.970
cases when you engage the overlay mode
so it's it's maybe not appropriate at

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:12.980
so it's it's maybe not appropriate at
 

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:14.950
so it's it's maybe not appropriate at
the moment for all applications

00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960
the moment for all applications
 

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.720
the moment for all applications
maybe if using custom UI controls it

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:16.730
maybe if using custom UI controls it
 

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:19.389
maybe if using custom UI controls it
could work but definitely if you can

00:30:19.389 --> 00:30:19.399
could work but definitely if you can
 

00:30:19.399 --> 00:30:20.889
could work but definitely if you can
enable it would be it's a really neat

00:30:20.889 --> 00:30:20.899
enable it would be it's a really neat
 

00:30:20.899 --> 00:30:22.690
enable it would be it's a really neat
feature to sort of make the map feel

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:22.700
feature to sort of make the map feel
 

00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:26.409
feature to sort of make the map feel
more immersive all right yeah let's fly

00:30:26.409 --> 00:30:26.419
more immersive all right yeah let's fly
 

00:30:26.419 --> 00:30:31.090
more immersive all right yeah let's fly
through yeah okay so embedded map so now

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:31.100
through yeah okay so embedded map so now
 

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.490
through yeah okay so embedded map so now
the map is not it's not full screen

00:30:33.490 --> 00:30:33.500
the map is not it's not full screen
 

00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.769
the map is not it's not full screen
anymore and and what's written here the

00:30:35.769 --> 00:30:35.779
anymore and and what's written here the
 

00:30:35.779 --> 00:30:37.509
anymore and and what's written here the
map is really the context here so it's

00:30:37.509 --> 00:30:37.519
map is really the context here so it's
 

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:38.799
map is really the context here so it's
just trying to give some context around

00:30:38.799 --> 00:30:38.809
just trying to give some context around
 

00:30:38.809 --> 00:30:40.299
just trying to give some context around
the information on the rest of the

00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:40.309
the information on the rest of the
 

00:30:40.309 --> 00:30:42.340
the information on the rest of the
screen in this case you should really be

00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:42.350
screen in this case you should really be
 

00:30:42.350 --> 00:30:44.049
screen in this case you should really be
removing or minimizing the UI

00:30:44.049 --> 00:30:44.059
removing or minimizing the UI
 

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:45.340
removing or minimizing the UI
controllers you know you don't really

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:45.350
controllers you know you don't really
 

00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:47.740
controllers you know you don't really
need to have the zoom buttons the users

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:47.750
need to have the zoom buttons the users
 

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.789
need to have the zoom buttons the users
probably not going to be doing two

00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799
probably not going to be doing two
 

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:50.230
probably not going to be doing two
fingered gestures in that time a little

00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240

this is an example from Foursquare by

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:52.970
this is an example from Foursquare by
 

00:30:52.970 --> 00:30:56.200
this is an example from Foursquare by
the way and the nice thing that force

the way and the nice thing that force
 

00:30:56.210 --> 00:30:57.310
the way and the nice thing that force
could actually does here is if you tap

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:57.320
could actually does here is if you tap
 

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.870
could actually does here is if you tap
on the map a single press it actually

00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880
on the map a single press it actually
 

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.159
on the map a single press it actually
expands the map out to the full screen

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:00.169
expands the map out to the full screen
 

00:31:00.169 --> 00:31:01.990
expands the map out to the full screen
and sort of switches back to that full

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:02.000
and sort of switches back to that full
 

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.090
and sort of switches back to that full
screen map mode that I was talking about

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:04.100
screen map mode that I was talking about
 

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.289
screen map mode that I was talking about
before and then the last thing is that

00:31:08.289 --> 00:31:08.299
before and then the last thing is that
 

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:09.879
before and then the last thing is that
there is a sort of you could potentially

00:31:09.879 --> 00:31:09.889
there is a sort of you could potentially
 

00:31:09.889 --> 00:31:12.039
there is a sort of you could potentially
switch using static Maps if you're using

00:31:12.039 --> 00:31:12.049
switch using static Maps if you're using
 

00:31:12.049 --> 00:31:14.560
switch using static Maps if you're using
embedded maps so not really having any

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:14.570
embedded maps so not really having any
 

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:16.930
embedded maps so not really having any
interactional or removing some of that

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:16.940
interactional or removing some of that
 

00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:19.240
interactional or removing some of that
dynamic feel from the maps until you tap

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:19.250
dynamic feel from the maps until you tap
 

00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:20.799
dynamic feel from the maps until you tap
on it and maybe be taken to a full

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:20.809
on it and maybe be taken to a full
 

00:31:20.809 --> 00:31:24.220

screen full screen map anything else so

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:24.230
screen full screen map anything else so
 

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:26.470

guys I know III really know I think I

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480
guys I know III really know I think I
 

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.549
guys I know III really know I think I
think you covered it pretty well though

00:31:27.549 --> 00:31:27.559
think you covered it pretty well though
 

00:31:27.559 --> 00:31:30.279
think you covered it pretty well though
sir yeah I would say so yeah also take a

00:31:30.279 --> 00:31:30.289
sir yeah I would say so yeah also take a
 

00:31:30.289 --> 00:31:31.570
sir yeah I would say so yeah also take a
look at it they're kind of the updates

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:31.580
look at it they're kind of the updates
 

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:32.950
look at it they're kind of the updates
to Google Maps applications I think

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960
to Google Maps applications I think
 

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.899
to Google Maps applications I think
that's a phenomenal job of doing some of

00:31:34.899 --> 00:31:34.909
that's a phenomenal job of doing some of
 

00:31:34.909 --> 00:31:35.980
that's a phenomenal job of doing some of
the things Roman was talking about like

00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:35.990
the things Roman was talking about like
 

00:31:35.990 --> 00:31:38.649
the things Roman was talking about like
keeping the kind of interface stable but

00:31:38.649 --> 00:31:38.659
keeping the kind of interface stable but
 

00:31:38.659 --> 00:31:40.299
keeping the kind of interface stable but
having easy interaction to kind of move

00:31:40.299 --> 00:31:40.309
having easy interaction to kind of move
 

00:31:40.309 --> 00:31:41.619
having easy interaction to kind of move
between different pins and stuff so I

00:31:41.619 --> 00:31:41.629
between different pins and stuff so I
 

00:31:41.629 --> 00:31:44.430
between different pins and stuff so I
think that's a great example as well yep

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:44.440
think that's a great example as well yep
 

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.769
think that's a great example as well yep
