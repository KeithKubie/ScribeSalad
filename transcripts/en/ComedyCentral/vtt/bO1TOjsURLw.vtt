00:00:05.304 --> 00:00:06.706
 - Hi, I'm Ron Funches.

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.508 size:88% position:44%
 I'm originally from
 Chicago, Illinois.

00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:10.243
I'm a Portland, Oregon comedian

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:12.311
 that now lives in Los Angeles.

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:14.214
 I moved to L.A. about,

00:00:15.781 --> 00:00:17.650
 almost two years ago.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.485 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I was getting
 divorced from my wife

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.688 size:88% position:44%
  and also my comedy
  was getting better

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:25.625
 and I needed to go to
 a place to continue it

00:00:25.658 --> 00:00:27.360
so I was like I need to
find a new place to live

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:30.663 align:start size:88% position:13%
 either way so I might
 as well go to L.A.

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.100 align:start position:0%
  I apologize to anybody
  who was offended by my use

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.803 align:start size:88% position:13%
 of the N word in
 that previous joke.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:39.739 size:88% position:44%
  I heard a couple of gasps.

00:00:39.772 --> 00:00:42.408
And I don't use that word often.

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.776 size:88% position:44%
 In fact, I struggle
 on whether or not

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.845
 I should use that word at all.

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:47.613 align:start position:0%
  I don't believe we
  should ever use that word

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:51.217
to hurt people, but I do
believe we should use it

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.685 size:88% position:44%
  to shame our pets.

00:00:52.718 --> 00:00:55.588 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:05.999 size:88% position:44%
  Your cat that's an asshole

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:11.571 align:start position:0%
  or a parakeet that thinks
  it's better than you.

00:01:11.604 --> 00:01:14.507 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.275
Oh, you think you better than me

00:01:16.308 --> 00:01:18.244
just 'cause you can fly?

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:20.246
Nigga, fuck you.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:23.382 size:84% position:42%
  (audience cheers)

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.818 align:start size:88% position:13%
I went to community
college for three weeks

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then I was like,
I'm not into this at all

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.623 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and so I just stopped
 going to that.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:32.391 align:start size:88% position:13%
 Like, I hated high
 school and then I went

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:33.826
 and I was like, oh,
 this is high school,

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.828
 but people can smoke freely.

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.431
And now, I hate this even more.

00:01:38.464 --> 00:01:42.568
 I just never had an interest
 in doing anything but comedy.

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.739 size:88% position:44%
 I would say do what it is
 that you really want to do.

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:48.674 size:88% position:44%
 You will fall on your face.

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:50.143
It is difficult.

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:51.144 size:88% position:44%
 It'll suck.

00:01:51.177 --> 00:01:52.845
Some people will be mean to you.

00:01:52.878 --> 00:01:55.081 align:start size:88% position:13%
 You might be homeless
 for a little bit.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:57.416
 But, after that, it gets cool.

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:58.318 size:84% position:42%
  It's fun.

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:03.423 size:88% position:44%
  I saw a gentleman on a bus
  with a tattoo on his neck

00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:07.127 size:88% position:44%
 that just read, fuck Linda.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:14.267 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:19.272
 That guy hates Linda.

00:02:24.276 --> 00:02:27.147 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:02:28.547 --> 00:02:31.017
 Or, he has to remind himself

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.755 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.294 size:88% position:44%
  to be intimate with Linda.

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:47.433 size:84% position:42%
  Either way, Linda
  could do better.

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:50.269 size:84% position:42%
  (audience laughs)

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:53.806 size:88% position:44%
