essentially there are three kinds of

essentially there are three kinds of
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.619
essentially there are three kinds of
interaction which are included in the

interaction which are included in the
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.649
interaction which are included in the
standard model the electromagnetic

addition strong interaction which also

this thing so that it is so these are
the three type of interaction which

the three type of interaction which
 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.490
the three type of interaction which
formed these particles that we know

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
formed these particles that we know
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.670
formed these particles that we know
today that are all together and getting

them which gives this C which permeates
 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.730
them which gives this C which permeates
the universe and and there is another

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740
the universe and and there is another
 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.020

interaction which we feel every day

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030
interaction which we feel every day
 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.830

which is gravitationally let an abject

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840

fall and it falls then why the planets

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620
fall and it falls then why the planets
 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.060
fall and it falls then why the planets
turn around the earth and why everything

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070
turn around the earth and why everything
 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.570
turn around the earth and why everything
like that works and that is also a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580
like that works and that is also a
 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.780
like that works and that is also a
theory but for the moment it is not

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
theory but for the moment it is not
 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.620
theory but for the moment it is not
included in the standard model it is

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
included in the standard model it is
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.820
included in the standard model it is
something apart we know it very well

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830
something apart we know it very well
 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.520
something apart we know it very well
it's the first thing that was known it

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
it's the first thing that was known it
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.090
it's the first thing that was known it
was redeveloped by Einstein and

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100
was redeveloped by Einstein and
 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.300
was redeveloped by Einstein and
generalized by Einstein is called the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310
generalized by Einstein is called the
 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.160
generalized by Einstein is called the
bad name but it's called general

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170
bad name but it's called general
 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.800
bad name but it's called general
relativity that was in the beginning of

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810
relativity that was in the beginning of
 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.380
relativity that was in the beginning of
the 20th century and so that is very

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390
the 20th century and so that is very
 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.660
the 20th century and so that is very
well known but it has its difficulties

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670
well known but it has its difficulties
 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.710
well known but it has its difficulties
and not I don't know if you want to

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720
and not I don't know if you want to
 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.700
and not I don't know if you want to
enter into that that's more complicated
