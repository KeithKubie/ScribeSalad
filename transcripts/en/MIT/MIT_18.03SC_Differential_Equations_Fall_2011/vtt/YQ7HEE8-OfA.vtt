00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.493
This is a brief,
so, the equation,

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:35.526
and we got the characteristic
equation from the last time.

00:00:35.526 --> 00:00:41.348
The general topic for today is
going to be oscillations,

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:47.169
which are extremely important
in the applications and in

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:50.980
everyday life.
But, the oscillations,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.532
we know, are associated with a
complex root.

00:00:55.532 --> 00:01:01.565
So, they correspond to complex
roots of the characteristic

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:06.257
equation.
r squared plus br plus k equals

00:01:06.257 --> 00:01:09.461
zero.
I'd like to begin.

00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:13.611
Most of the lecture will be
about discussing the relations

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:16.378
between these numbers,
these constants,

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:19.655
and the various properties that
the solutions,

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:21.621
oscillatory solutions,
have.

00:01:21.621 --> 00:01:24.970
But, before that,
I'd like to begin by clearing

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.412
up a couple of questions almost
everybody has at some point or

00:01:29.412 --> 00:01:34.000
other when they study the case
of complex roots.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.169
Complex roots are the case
which produce oscillations in

00:01:38.169 --> 00:01:40.746
the solutions.
That's the relation,

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:44.839
and that's why I'm talking
about this for the first few

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:47.341
minutes.
Now, what is the problem?

00:01:47.341 --> 00:01:50.827
The complex roots,
of course, there will be two

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:54.921
roots, and they occur at the
complex conjugates of each

00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:57.650
other.
So, they will be of the form a

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.659
plus or minus bi.
Last time, I showed you,

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.090
I took the root r equals a plus
bi,

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.629
which leads to the solution.
The corresponding solution is a

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:21.279
complex solution which is e to
the at, (a plus i b)t.

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.715
And, what we did was the

00:02:24.715 --> 00:02:29.702
problem was to get real
solutions out of that.

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:36.130
We needed two real solutions,
and the way I got them was by

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.000
separating this into its real
part and its imaginary part.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.320
And, I proved a little theorem
for you that said both of those

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.770
give solutions.
So, the real part was e to the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.873
a t times cosine b t,
and the imaginary

00:02:52.873 --> 00:02:55.487
part was e to the at sine b t.

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:57.283
And, those were the two
solutions.

00:02:57.283 --> 00:02:59.515
So, here was y1.
And, the point was those,

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:03.000
out of the complex solutions,
we got real solutions.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.222
We have to have real solutions
because we live in the real

00:03:07.222 --> 00:03:09.222
world.
The equation is real.

00:03:09.222 --> 00:03:13.444
Its coefficients are real.
They represent real quantities.

00:03:13.444 --> 00:03:17.222
That's the way the solutions,
therefore, have to be.

00:03:17.222 --> 00:03:21.148
So, these, the point is,
these are now real solutions,

00:03:21.148 --> 00:03:23.000
these two guys,
y1 and y2.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.259
Now, the first question almost
everybody has,

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:29.962
and I was pleased to see at the
end of the lecture,

00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:33.296
a few people came up and asked
me, yeah, well,

00:03:33.296 --> 00:03:36.703
you took a plus bi,
but there was another root,

00:03:36.703 --> 00:03:40.594
a minus bi.
You didn't use that one.

00:03:40.594 --> 00:03:43.319
That would give two more
solutions, right?

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.379
Of course, they didn't say
that.

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.705
They were too smart.
They just said,

00:03:47.705 --> 00:03:50.829
what about that other root?
Well, what about it?

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:54.949
The reason I don't have to talk
about the other root is because

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.537
although it does give to
solutions, it doesn't give two

00:03:58.537 --> 00:04:02.684
new ones.
Maybe I can indicate that most

00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:07.873
clearly here even though you
won't be able to take notes by

00:04:07.873 --> 00:04:12.884
just using colored chalk.
Suppose, instead of plus bi,

00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:16.105
I used a minus bi.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:20.668
What would have changed?
Well, this would now become

00:04:20.668 --> 00:04:23.263
minus here.
Would this change?

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:28.542
No, because e to the minus ibt
is the cosine of

00:04:28.542 --> 00:04:34.000
minus b, but that's the same as
the cosine of b.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.810
How about here?
This would become the sine of

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.312
minus bt.
But that's simply the negative

00:04:42.312 --> 00:04:47.594
of the sine of bt.
So, the only change would have

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:52.790
been to put a minus sign there.
Now, I don't care if I get y2

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.293
or negative y2 because what am I
going to do with it?

00:04:57.293 --> 00:05:00.324
When I get it,
I'm going to write y,

00:05:00.324 --> 00:05:05.000
the general solution,
as c1 y1 plus c2 y2.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.040
So, if I get negative y2,
that just changes that

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.767
arbitrary constant from c2 to
minus c2, which is just as

00:05:13.767 --> 00:05:17.206
arbitrary a constant.
So, in other words,

00:05:17.206 --> 00:05:22.106
there's no reason to use the
other root because it doesn't

00:05:22.106 --> 00:05:25.888
give anything new.
Now, there the story could

00:05:25.888 --> 00:05:28.810
stop.
And, I would like it to stop,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.022
frankly, but I don't dare
because there's a second

00:05:33.022 --> 00:05:37.018
question.
And, I'm visiting recitations

00:05:37.018 --> 00:05:40.079
not this semester,
but in previous semesters.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:42.654
In 18.03, so many recitations
do this.

00:05:42.654 --> 00:05:46.899
I have to partly inoculate you
against it, and partly tell you

00:05:46.899 --> 00:05:50.030
that some of the engineering
courses do do it,

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.301
and therefore you probably
should learn it also.

00:05:53.301 --> 00:05:57.198
So, there is another way of
proceeding, which is what you

00:05:57.198 --> 00:06:00.538
might have thought.
Hey, look, we got two complex

00:06:00.538 --> 00:06:04.468
roots.
That gives us two solutions,

00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:08.435
which are different.
Neither one is a constant

00:06:08.435 --> 00:06:12.667
multiple of the other.
So, the other approach is,

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:16.282
use, as a general solution,
y equals, now,

00:06:16.282 --> 00:06:19.191
I'm going to put a capital C
here.

00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:24.304
You will see why in just a
second, times e to the (a plus b

00:06:24.304 --> 00:06:27.390
i) times t.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:32.680
And then, I will use the other
solution: C2 times e to the (a

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:37.000
minus b i) t.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.632
These are two independent
solutions.

00:06:39.632 --> 00:06:42.415
And therefore,
can't I get the general

00:06:42.415 --> 00:06:45.272
solution in that form?
Now, in a sense,

00:06:45.272 --> 00:06:47.679
you can.
The whole problem is the

00:06:47.679 --> 00:06:51.289
following, of course,
that I'm only interested in

00:06:51.289 --> 00:06:54.448
real solutions.
This is a complex function.

00:06:54.448 --> 00:06:56.855
This is another complex
function.

00:06:56.855 --> 00:06:59.487
It's got an i in it,
in other words,

00:06:59.487 --> 00:07:04.000
when I write it out as u plus
iv.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.750
If I expect to be able to get a
real solution out of that,

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:13.416
that means I have to make,
allow these coefficients to be

00:07:13.416 --> 00:07:16.500
complex numbers,
and not real numbers.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:20.250
So, in other words,
what I'm saying is that an

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.583
expression like this,
where the a plus bi and a minus

00:07:24.583 --> 00:07:28.916
bi are complex roots of that
characteristic equation,

00:07:28.916 --> 00:07:33.083
is formally a very general,
complex solution to the

00:07:33.083 --> 00:07:36.619
equation.
And therefore,

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:41.938
the problem becomes,
how, from this expression,

00:07:41.938 --> 00:07:47.374
do I get the real solutions?
So, the problem is,

00:07:47.374 --> 00:07:51.884
I accept these as the complex
solutions.

00:07:51.884 --> 00:07:56.741
My problem is,
to find among all these guys

00:07:56.741 --> 00:08:03.333
where C1 and C2 are allowed to
be complex, the problem is,

00:08:03.333 --> 00:08:09.000
which of the green solutions
are real?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.667
Now, there are many ways of
getting the answer.

00:08:12.667 --> 00:08:17.053
There is a super hack way.
The super hack way is to say,

00:08:17.053 --> 00:08:20.481
well, this one is C1 plus i d1.

00:08:20.481 --> 00:08:23.112
This is C2 plus i d2.

00:08:23.112 --> 00:08:27.179
And, I'll write all this out in
terms of what it is,

00:08:27.179 --> 00:08:31.803
you know, cosine plus i sine,
and don't forget the e to the

00:08:31.803 --> 00:08:34.841
at.
And, I will write it all out,

00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:36.873
and it will take an entire
board.

00:08:36.873 --> 00:08:39.857
And then, I will just see what
the condition is.

00:08:39.857 --> 00:08:42.904
I'll write its real part,
and its imaginary part.

00:08:42.904 --> 00:08:46.206
And then, I will say the
imaginary part has got to be

00:08:46.206 --> 00:08:48.428
zero.
And, then I will see what it's

00:08:48.428 --> 00:08:49.761
like.
That works fine.

00:08:49.761 --> 00:08:53.507
It just takes too much space.
And also, it doesn't teach you

00:08:53.507 --> 00:08:56.111
a few things that I think you
should know.

00:08:56.111 --> 00:08:59.730
So, I'm going to give another.
So, let's say we can answer

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.142
this two ways:
by hack, in other words,

00:09:02.142 --> 00:09:07.115
multiply everything out.
Multiply all out,

00:09:07.115 --> 00:09:11.347
make the imaginary part equal
zero.

00:09:11.347 --> 00:09:16.201
Now, here's a better way,
in my opinion.

00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:23.047
What I'm trying to do is,
this is some complex function,

00:09:23.047 --> 00:09:27.776
u plus iv.
How do I know when a complex

00:09:27.776 --> 00:09:34.000
function is real?
I want this to be real.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.333
Well, the hack method
corresponds to,

00:09:38.333 --> 00:09:44.592
say, v must be equal to zero.
It's real if v is zero.

00:09:44.592 --> 00:09:49.407
So, expand it out,
and see why v is zero.

00:09:49.407 --> 00:09:56.750
There's a slightly more subtle
method, which is to change i to

00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:00.000
minus i.
And, what?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:10.014
And, see if it stays the same
because if I change i to minus i

00:10:10.014 --> 00:10:17.731
and it turns out,
the expression doesn't change,

00:10:17.731 --> 00:10:26.432
then it must have been real,
if the expression doesn't

00:10:26.432 --> 00:10:33.000
change when I change I to minus
I.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.988
Well, sure.
But you will see it works.

00:10:36.988 --> 00:10:41.622
Now, that's what I'm going to
apply to this.

00:10:41.622 --> 00:10:46.796
If I want this to be real,
I phrase the question,

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:52.832
I rephrase the question for the
green solution as change,

00:10:52.832 --> 00:10:58.652
so I'm going to change i to
minus i in the green thing,

00:10:58.652 --> 00:11:03.287
and that's going to give me
what conditions,

00:11:03.287 --> 00:11:09.000
and that will give conditions
on the C's.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.403
Well, let's do it.
In fact, it's easier done than

00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:14.246
talked about.
Let's change,

00:11:14.246 --> 00:11:16.728
take the green solution,
and change.

00:11:16.728 --> 00:11:18.713
Well, I better recopy it,
C1.

00:11:18.713 --> 00:11:22.684
So, these are complex numbers.
That's why I wrote them as

00:11:22.684 --> 00:11:27.080
capital letters because little
letters you tend to interpret as

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.129
real numbers.
So, C1 e to the (a plus b i)t,

00:11:30.129 --> 00:11:33.887
I'll recopy it quickly,
plus C2 e to the (a minus b i).

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.794
Okay, we're going to change i
to negative i.

00:11:41.794 --> 00:11:46.735
Now, here's a complex number.
What happens to it when you

00:11:46.735 --> 00:11:51.500
change i to negative i?
You change it into its-- Class?

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:55.558
What do we change it to?
Its complex conjugate.

00:11:55.558 --> 00:12:00.852
And, the notation for complex
conjugate is you put a bar over

00:12:00.852 --> 00:12:03.791
it.
So, in other words,

00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:07.562
when I do that,
the C1 changes to C1 bar,

00:12:07.562 --> 00:12:11.898
complex conjugate,
the complex conjugate of C1.

00:12:11.898 --> 00:12:17.178
What happens to this guy?
This guy changes to e to the (a

00:12:17.178 --> 00:12:22.646
minus b i) t.
This changes to the complex

00:12:22.646 --> 00:12:27.265
conjugate of C2 now,
times e to the (a plus b i) t.

00:12:27.265 --> 00:12:32.855
Well, I want these two to be

00:12:32.855 --> 00:12:36.832
the same.
I want the two expressions the

00:12:36.832 --> 00:12:40.197
same.
Why do I want them the same?

00:12:40.197 --> 00:12:46.315
Because, if there's no change,
that will mean that it's real.

00:12:46.315 --> 00:12:49.680
Now, when is that going to
happen?

00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:53.250
That happens if,
well, here is this,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.513
that.
If C2 should be equal to C1

00:12:56.513 --> 00:13:02.958
bar, that's only one condition.
There's another condition.

00:13:02.958 --> 00:13:06.574
C2 bar should equal C1.
So, I get two conditions,

00:13:06.574 --> 00:13:10.942
but there's really only one
condition there because if this

00:13:10.942 --> 00:13:14.859
is true, that's true too.
I simply put bars over both

00:13:14.859 --> 00:13:18.023
things, and two bars cancel each
other out.

00:13:18.023 --> 00:13:21.714
If you take the complex
conjugate and do it again,

00:13:21.714 --> 00:13:25.555
you get back where you started.
Change i to minus i,

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:30.000
and then i to minus i again.
Well, never mind.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.290
Anyway, these are the same.
This equation doesn't say

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:41.854
anything that the first one
didn't say already.

00:13:41.854 --> 00:13:48.750
So, this one is redundant.
And, our conclusion is that the

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:55.161
real solutions to the equation
are, in their entirety,

00:13:55.161 --> 00:14:00.000
I now don't need both C2 and
C1.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.787
One of them will do,
and since I'm going to write it

00:14:03.787 --> 00:14:07.871
out as a complex number,
I will write it out in terms of

00:14:07.871 --> 00:14:09.950
its coefficient.
So, it's C1.

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.034
Let's just simply write it.
C plus i times d,

00:14:14.034 --> 00:14:18.044
that's the coefficient.
That's what I called C1 before.

00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:22.425
And, that's times e to the (a
plus b i) t.

00:14:22.425 --> 00:14:25.990
There's no reason why I put bi
here and id there,

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:30.000
in case you're wondering,
sheer caprice.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.033
And what's the other term?
Now, the other term is

00:14:34.033 --> 00:14:38.487
completely determined.
Its coefficient must be C minus

00:14:38.487 --> 00:14:43.613
i d times e to the
(a minus b i) t.

00:14:43.613 --> 00:14:46.806
In other words,
this thing is perfectly

00:14:46.806 --> 00:14:49.915
general.
Any complex number times that

00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:52.689
first root you use,
exponentiated,

00:14:52.689 --> 00:14:56.890
and the second term can be
described as the complex

00:14:56.890 --> 00:15:03.557
conjugate of the first.
The coefficient is the complex

00:15:03.557 --> 00:15:10.316
conjugate, and this part is the
complex conjugate of that.

00:15:10.316 --> 00:15:15.889
Now, it's in this form,
many engineers write the

00:15:15.889 --> 00:15:19.802
solution this way,
and physicists,

00:15:19.802 --> 00:15:25.612
too, so, scientists and
engineers we will include.

00:15:25.612 --> 00:15:32.066
Write the solution this way.
Write the real solutions this

00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:35.985
way in that complex form.
Well, why do they do something

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:38.692
so perverse?
You will have to ask them.

00:15:38.692 --> 00:15:41.828
But, in fact,
when we studied Fourier series,

00:15:41.828 --> 00:15:45.818
we will probably have to do
something, have to do that at

00:15:45.818 --> 00:15:48.668
one point.
If you work a lot with complex

00:15:48.668 --> 00:15:51.589
numbers, it turns out to be,
in some ways,

00:15:51.589 --> 00:15:55.081
a more convenient
representation than the one I've

00:15:55.081 --> 00:15:59.000
given you in terms of sines and
cosines.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.506
Well, from this,
how would I get,

00:16:01.506 --> 00:16:05.343
suppose I insisted,
well, if someone gave it to me

00:16:05.343 --> 00:16:08.789
in that form,
I don't see how I would convert

00:16:08.789 --> 00:16:13.487
it back into sines and cosines.
And, I'd like to show you how

00:16:13.487 --> 00:16:16.307
to do that efficiently,
too, because,

00:16:16.307 --> 00:16:20.301
again, it's one of the
fundamental techniques that I

00:16:20.301 --> 00:16:24.295
think you should know.
And, I didn't get a chance to

00:16:24.295 --> 00:16:28.759
say it when we studied complex
numbers that first lecture.

00:16:28.759 --> 00:16:32.439
It's in the notes,
but it doesn't prove anything

00:16:32.439 --> 00:16:38.000
since I don't think it made you
use it in an example.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.631
So, the problem is,
now, by way of finishing this

00:16:43.631 --> 00:16:50.083
up, too, to change this to the
old form, I mean the form

00:16:50.083 --> 00:16:56.888
involving sines and cosines.
Now, again, there are two ways

00:16:56.888 --> 00:17:01.136
of doing it.
The hack way is you write it

00:17:01.136 --> 00:17:03.883
all out.
Well, e to the (a plus b i)t

00:17:03.883 --> 00:17:08.232
turns into e to the a t times

00:17:08.232 --> 00:17:12.353
cosine this plus i sine that.
And, the other term does,

00:17:12.353 --> 00:17:14.871
too.
And then you've got stuff out

00:17:14.871 --> 00:17:17.542
front.
And, the thing stretches over

00:17:17.542 --> 00:17:20.441
two boards.
But you group all the terms

00:17:20.441 --> 00:17:22.578
together.
You finally get it.

00:17:22.578 --> 00:17:26.927
By the way, when you do it,
you'll find that the imaginary

00:17:26.927 --> 00:17:31.124
part disappears completely.
It has to because that's the

00:17:31.124 --> 00:17:37.000
way we chose the coefficients.
So, here's the hack method.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.007
Write it all out:
blah, blah, blah,

00:17:40.007 --> 00:17:42.926
blah, blah, blah,
blah, and nicer.

00:17:42.926 --> 00:17:47.703
Nicer, and teach you something
you're supposed to know.

00:17:47.703 --> 00:17:50.446
Write it this way.
First of all,

00:17:50.446 --> 00:17:55.488
you notice that both terms have
an e to the a t

00:17:55.488 --> 00:17:58.496
factor.
Let's get rid of that right

00:17:58.496 --> 00:18:02.074
away.
I'm pulling it out front

00:18:02.074 --> 00:18:06.224
because that's automatically
real, and therefore,

00:18:06.224 --> 00:18:10.634
isn't going to affect the rest
of the answer at all.

00:18:10.634 --> 00:18:14.092
So, let's pull out that,
and what's left?

00:18:14.092 --> 00:18:18.242
Well, what's left,
you see, involves just the two

00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:22.564
parameters, C and d,
so I'm going to have a C term.

00:18:22.564 --> 00:18:25.244
And, I'm going to have a d
term.

00:18:25.244 --> 00:18:30.000
What multiplies the arbitrary
constant, C?

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.629
Answer: after I remove the e to
the a t,

00:18:34.629 --> 00:18:39.537
what multiplies it is,
e to the b i t plus e to the --

00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:43.981
e to the b i t.
Let's write it i b t.

00:18:43.981 --> 00:18:48.611
And, the other term is plus e
to the negative i b t.

00:18:48.611 --> 00:18:51.574
See how I got that,

00:18:51.574 --> 00:18:54.814
pulled it out?
And, how about the d?

00:18:54.814 --> 00:18:57.500
What goes with d?
d goes with,

00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:01.851
well, first of all,
there's an I in front that i

00:19:01.851 --> 00:19:07.967
better not forget.
And then, the rest of it is i.

00:19:07.967 --> 00:19:11.824
So, it's i d times,
it's e to the b i t,

00:19:11.824 --> 00:19:16.373
e to the i b t minus,
now, e to the minus i b t.

00:19:16.373 --> 00:19:22.208
So, that's the way the solution

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:25.670
looks.
It doesn't look a lot better,

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:30.219
but now you must use the magic
formulas, which,

00:19:30.219 --> 00:19:35.560
I want you to know as well as
you know Euler's formula,

00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:41.000
even better than you know
Euler's formula.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.428
They're a consequence of
Euler's formula.

00:19:43.428 --> 00:19:45.734
They're Euler's formula read
backwards.

00:19:45.734 --> 00:19:49.255
Euler's formula says you've got
a complex exponential here.

00:19:49.255 --> 00:19:52.412
Here's how to write it in terms
of sines and cosines.

00:19:52.412 --> 00:19:55.690
The backwards thing says you've
got a sine or a cosine.

00:19:55.690 --> 00:20:00.000
Here is the way to write it in
terms of complex exponentials.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.050
And, remember,
the way to do it is,

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:11.555
cosine a is equal to e to the i
a t, i a, plus e to the negative

00:20:11.555 --> 00:20:17.631
i a divided by two.

00:20:17.631 --> 00:20:24.303
And, sine of a is almost the
same thing, except you use a

00:20:24.303 --> 00:20:28.949
minus sign.
And, what everybody forgets,

00:20:28.949 --> 00:20:35.155
you have to divide by i.
So, this is a backwards version

00:20:35.155 --> 00:20:38.563
of Euler's formula.
The two of them taken together

00:20:38.563 --> 00:20:40.858
are equivalent to Euler's
formula.

00:20:40.858 --> 00:20:44.057
If I took cosine a,
multiply this through by i,

00:20:44.057 --> 00:20:47.395
and added them up,
on the right-hand side I'd get

00:20:47.395 --> 00:20:51.220
exactly e to the ia.
I'd get Euler's formula,

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.237
in other words.
All right, so,

00:20:53.237 --> 00:20:55.880
what does this come out to be,
finally?

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.314
This particular sum of
exponentials,

00:20:58.314 --> 00:21:02.000
you should always recognize as
real.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.049
You know it's real because when
you change i to minus i,

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:10.262
the two terms switch.
And therefore,

00:21:10.262 --> 00:21:14.026
the expression doesn't change.
What is it?

00:21:14.026 --> 00:21:18.524
This part is twice the cosine
of bt.

00:21:18.524 --> 00:21:22.931
What's this part?
This part is 2 i times the sine

00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:27.337
of bt.
And so, what does the whole

00:21:27.337 --> 00:21:33.214
thing come to be?
It is e to the a t times 2C

00:21:33.214 --> 00:21:38.571
cosine bt plus i times,
did I lose possibly a,

00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:43.095
no it's okay,
minus i times i is minus,

00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:50.000
so, minus 2d times the sine of
bt.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Shall I write that out?

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.697
So, in other words,
it's e to the a t times 2C

00:21:58.697 --> 00:22:03.708
cosine b t minus 2d times the
sine of b t,

00:22:03.708 --> 00:22:07.570
which is, since 2C and negative

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:12.171
2d are just arbitrary constants,
just as arbitrary as the

00:22:12.171 --> 00:22:15.046
constants of C and d themselves
are.

00:22:15.046 --> 00:22:19.072
This is our old form of writing
the real solution.

00:22:19.072 --> 00:22:24.002
Here's the way using science
and cosines, and there's the way

00:22:24.002 --> 00:22:30.000
that uses complex numbers and
complex functions throughout.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.917
Notice they both have two
arbitrary constants in them,

00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:36.282
C and d, two arbitrary
constants.

00:22:36.282 --> 00:22:39.460
That, you expect.
But that has two arbitrary

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.269
constants in it,
too, just the real and

00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:46.704
imaginary parts of that complex
coefficient, C plus i d.

00:22:46.704 --> 00:22:48.847
Well, that took half the

00:22:48.847 --> 00:22:52.321
period, and it was a long,
I don't consider it a

00:22:52.321 --> 00:22:56.239
digression because learning
those ways of dealing with

00:22:56.239 --> 00:23:00.452
complex numbers of complex
functions is a fairly important

00:23:00.452 --> 00:23:04.000
goal in this course,
actually.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.618
But let's get back now to
studying what the oscillations

00:23:07.618 --> 00:23:09.000
actually look like.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:34.692
Okay, well, I'd like to save a
little time, but very quickly,

00:23:34.692 --> 00:23:39.692
you don't have to reproduce
this sketch.

00:23:39.692 --> 00:23:45.076
I remember very well from
Friday to Monday,

00:23:45.076 --> 00:23:51.487
but I can't expect you to for a
variety of reasons.

00:23:51.487 --> 00:23:58.153
I mean, I have to think about
this stuff all weekend.

00:23:58.153 --> 00:24:03.473
And you, God forbid.
So, here's the picture,

00:24:03.473 --> 00:24:06.036
and I won't explain anymore
what's in it,

00:24:06.036 --> 00:24:09.368
except there's the mass.
Here is the spring constant,

00:24:09.368 --> 00:24:11.482
the spring with its constant
here.

00:24:11.482 --> 00:24:13.789
Here's the dashpot with its
constant.

00:24:13.789 --> 00:24:16.672
The equation is from Newton's
law: m x double,

00:24:16.672 --> 00:24:19.235
so this will be x,
and here's, let's say,

00:24:19.235 --> 00:24:21.414
the equilibrium point is over
here.

00:24:21.414 --> 00:24:25.066
It looks like m x double prime;
we derived this last time,

00:24:25.066 --> 00:24:30.000
plus c x prime plus k x equals
zero.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.932
And now, if I put that in
standard form,

00:24:33.932 --> 00:24:39.275
it's going to look like x
double prime plus c over m x

00:24:39.275 --> 00:24:45.123
prime plus k over m times x
equals zero.

00:24:45.123 --> 00:24:47.744
And, finally,

00:24:47.744 --> 00:24:52.382
the standard form in which your
book writes it,

00:24:52.382 --> 00:24:56.919
which is good,
it's a standard form in general

00:24:56.919 --> 00:25:02.061
that is used in the science and
engineering courses.

00:25:02.061 --> 00:25:05.993
One writes this as,
just to be perverse,

00:25:05.993 --> 00:25:11.539
I'm going to change x back to
y, okay, mostly just to be

00:25:11.539 --> 00:25:19.000
eclectic, to get you used to
every conceivable notation.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.339
So, I'm going to write this to
change x to y.

00:25:22.339 --> 00:25:26.133
So, that's going to become y
double prime.

00:25:26.133 --> 00:25:30.459
And now, this is given a new
name, p, except to get rid of

00:25:30.459 --> 00:25:33.799
lots of twos,
which would really screw up the

00:25:33.799 --> 00:25:38.224
formulas, make it 2p.
You will see why in a minute.

00:25:38.224 --> 00:25:42.595
So, there's 2p times y prime,
and this thing we

00:25:42.595 --> 00:25:46.660
are going to call omega nought
squared.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:49.728
Now, that's okay.
It's a positive number.

00:25:49.728 --> 00:25:53.946
Any positive number is the
square of some other positive

00:25:53.946 --> 00:25:55.941
number.
Take a square root.

00:25:55.941 --> 00:25:59.238
You will see why,
it makes the formulas much

00:25:59.238 --> 00:26:04.082
pretty to call it that.
And, it makes also a lot of

00:26:04.082 --> 00:26:08.708
things much easier to remember.
So, all I'm doing is changing

00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:13.104
the names of the constants that
way in order to get better

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:16.805
formulas, easier to remember
formulas at the end.

00:26:16.805 --> 00:26:20.507
Now, we are interested in the
case where there is

00:26:20.507 --> 00:26:22.666
oscillations.
In other words,

00:26:22.666 --> 00:26:27.139
I only care about the case in
which this has complex roots,

00:26:27.139 --> 00:26:31.457
because if it has just real
roots, that's the over-damped

00:26:31.457 --> 00:26:35.473
case.
I don't get any oscillations.

00:26:35.473 --> 00:26:40.847
By far, oscillations are by far
the more important of the cases,

00:26:40.847 --> 00:26:43.747
I mean, just because,
I don't know,

00:26:43.747 --> 00:26:48.864
I could go on for five minutes
listing things that oscillate,

00:26:48.864 --> 00:26:51.679
oscillations,
you know, like this.

00:26:51.679 --> 00:26:56.285
So they can oscillate by going
to sleep, and waking up,

00:26:56.285 --> 00:26:59.099
and going to sleep,
and waking up.

00:26:59.099 --> 00:27:03.933
They could oscillate.
So, that means we're going to

00:27:03.933 --> 00:27:07.133
get complex roots.
The characteristic equation is

00:27:07.133 --> 00:27:10.466
going to be r squared plus 2p.
So, p is a constant,

00:27:10.466 --> 00:27:13.266
now, right?
Often, p I use in this position

00:27:13.266 --> 00:27:16.866
to indicate a function of t.
But here, p is a constant.

00:27:16.866 --> 00:27:20.666
So, r squared plus 2p times r
plus omega nought squared is

00:27:20.666 --> 00:27:23.599
equal to zero.

00:27:23.599 --> 00:27:27.066
Now, what are its roots?
Well, you see right away the

00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:31.000
first advantage in putting in
the two there.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.981
When I use the quadratic
formula, it's negative 2p over

00:27:34.981 --> 00:27:37.783
two.
Remember that two in the

00:27:37.783 --> 00:27:40.806
denominator.
So, that's simply negative p.

00:27:40.806 --> 00:27:44.714
And, how about the rest?
Plus or minus the square root

00:27:44.714 --> 00:27:48.990
of, now do it in your head.
4p squared minus 4 omega nought

00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:53.414
squared.
So, there's a four in both of

00:27:53.414 --> 00:27:56.511
those terms.
When I pull it outside becomes

00:27:56.511 --> 00:27:59.092
two.
And, the two in the denominator

00:27:59.092 --> 00:28:03.000
is lurking, waiting to
annihilate it.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.374
So, that two disappears
entirely, and it will we are

00:28:06.374 --> 00:28:09.152
left with is,
simply, p squared minus omega

00:28:09.152 --> 00:28:11.468
nought squared.

00:28:11.468 --> 00:28:14.511
Now, whenever people write
quadratic equations,

00:28:14.511 --> 00:28:18.282
and arbitrarily put a two in
there, it's because they were

00:28:18.282 --> 00:28:21.854
going to want to solve the
quadratic equation using the

00:28:21.854 --> 00:28:24.964
quadratic formula,
and they don't want all those

00:28:24.964 --> 00:28:29.000
twos and fours to be cluttering
up the formula.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.706
That's what we are doing here.
Okay, now, the first case is

00:28:33.706 --> 00:28:37.683
where p is equal to zero.
This is going to explain

00:28:37.683 --> 00:28:41.659
immediately why I wrote that
omega nought squared,

00:28:41.659 --> 00:28:44.986
as you probably already know
from physics.

00:28:44.986 --> 00:28:48.395
If p is equal to zero,
the mass isn't zero.

00:28:48.395 --> 00:28:52.209
Otherwise, nothing good would
be happening here.

00:28:52.209 --> 00:28:55.049
It must be that the damping is
zero.

00:28:55.049 --> 00:29:00.000
So, p is equal to zero
corresponds to undamped.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.433
There is no dashpot.
The oscillations are undamped.

00:29:03.433 --> 00:29:06.592
And, the equation,
then, becomes the solutions,

00:29:06.592 --> 00:29:09.339
then, are, well,
the equation becomes the

00:29:09.339 --> 00:29:12.154
equation of simple harmonic
motion, which,

00:29:12.154 --> 00:29:15.725
I think you already are used to
writing in this form.

00:29:15.725 --> 00:29:19.776
And, the reason you're writing
in this form because you know

00:29:19.776 --> 00:29:22.660
when you do that,
this becomes the circular

00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.231
frequency of the oscillations.
The solutions are pure

00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:29.184
oscillations,
and omega nought is

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:33.820
the circular frequency.
So, right away from the

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.382
equation itself,
if you write it in this form,

00:29:37.382 --> 00:29:41.656
you can read off what the
frequency of the solutions is

00:29:41.656 --> 00:29:45.772
going to be, the circular
frequency of the solutions.

00:29:45.772 --> 00:29:49.808
Now, the solutions themselves,
of course, look like,

00:29:49.808 --> 00:29:54.399
the general solutions look like
y equal, in this particular

00:29:54.399 --> 00:29:57.407
case, the p part is zero.
This is zero.

00:29:57.407 --> 00:29:59.702
It's simply,
so, in this case,

00:29:59.702 --> 00:30:03.976
r is equal to omega nought i
times omega naught plus or

00:30:03.976 --> 00:30:08.805
minus, but as before we don't
bother with the minus sign since

00:30:08.805 --> 00:30:13.000
one of those roots is good
enough.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.854
And then, the solutions are
simply c1 cosine omega nought t

00:30:16.854 --> 00:30:20.908
plus c2 sine omega nought t.

00:30:20.908 --> 00:30:23.167
That's if you write it out in

00:30:23.167 --> 00:30:26.623
the sign, and if you write it
using the trigonometric

00:30:26.623 --> 00:30:30.810
identity, then the other way of
writing it is a times the cosine

00:30:30.810 --> 00:30:34.000
of omega nought t.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.616
But now you will have to put it
a phase lag.

00:30:37.616 --> 00:30:41.149
So, you have those two forms of
writing it.

00:30:41.149 --> 00:30:45.691
And, I assume you remember
writing the little triangle,

00:30:45.691 --> 00:30:48.467
which converts one into the
other.

00:30:48.467 --> 00:30:53.177
Okay, so this justifies calling
this omega nought squared

00:30:53.177 --> 00:30:56.794
rather than k over m.

00:30:56.794 --> 00:31:01.672
And now, the question is what
does the damp case look like?

00:31:01.672 --> 00:31:06.383
It requires a somewhat closer
analysis, and it requires a

00:31:06.383 --> 00:31:13.710
certain amount of thinking.
So, let's begin with an epsilon

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:18.378
bit of thinking.
So, here's my question.

00:31:18.378 --> 00:31:24.243
So, in the damped case,
I want to be sure that I'm

00:31:24.243 --> 00:31:30.347
getting oscillations.
When do I get oscillations if,

00:31:30.347 --> 00:31:37.409
well, we get oscillations if
those roots are really complex,

00:31:37.409 --> 00:31:43.651
and not masquerading.
Now, when are the roots going

00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:46.942
to be really complex?
This has to be,

00:31:46.942 --> 00:31:52.337
the inside has to be negative.
p squared minus omega squared

00:31:52.337 --> 00:31:56.085
must be negative.

00:31:56.085 --> 00:32:01.388
p squared minus omega nought
squared must be less than zero

00:32:01.388 --> 00:32:06.325
so that we are taking a square
root of negative number,

00:32:06.325 --> 00:32:09.891
and we are getting a real
complex roots,

00:32:09.891 --> 00:32:14.210
really complex roots.
In other words,

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:17.842
now, this says,
remember these numbers are all

00:32:17.842 --> 00:32:21.150
positive, p and omega nought are
positive.

00:32:21.150 --> 00:32:25.912
So, the condition is that p
should be

00:32:25.912 --> 00:32:28.494
less than omega nought.
In other words,

00:32:28.494 --> 00:32:32.852
the damping should be less than
the circular frequency,

00:32:32.852 --> 00:32:38.072
except p is not the damping.
It's half the damping,

00:32:38.072 --> 00:32:43.817
and it's not really the damping
either because it involved the

00:32:43.817 --> 00:32:47.113
m, too.
You'd better just call it p.

00:32:47.113 --> 00:32:52.387
Naturally, I could write the
condition out in terms of c,

00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:55.495
m, and k.
So, your book does that,

00:32:55.495 --> 00:32:59.922
but I'm not going to.
It gives it in terms of c,

00:32:59.922 --> 00:33:03.972
m, and k, which somebody might
want to know.

00:33:03.972 --> 00:33:08.116
But, you know,
we don't have to do everything

00:33:08.116 --> 00:33:12.494
here.
Okay, so let's assume that this

00:33:12.494 --> 00:33:15.632
is true.
What is the solution look like?

00:33:15.632 --> 00:33:19.574
Well, we already experimented
with that last time.

00:33:19.574 --> 00:33:23.597
Remember, there was some
guiding thing which was an

00:33:23.597 --> 00:33:26.172
exponential.
And then, down here,

00:33:26.172 --> 00:33:31.000
we wrote the negative.
So, this was an exponential.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.525
In fact, it was the
exponential, e to the negative

00:33:35.525 --> 00:33:38.850
pt.
And, in between that,

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.713
the curve tried to do its
thing.

00:33:41.713 --> 00:33:45.407
So, the solution looks sort of
like this.

00:33:45.407 --> 00:33:48.732
It oscillated,
but it had to use that

00:33:48.732 --> 00:33:53.904
exponential function as its
guidelines, as its amplitude,

00:33:53.904 --> 00:33:57.968
in other words.
Now, this is a truly terrible

00:33:57.968 --> 00:34:01.660
picture.
It's so terrible,

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.373
it's unusable.
Okay, this picture never

00:34:05.373 --> 00:34:07.620
happened.
Unfortunately,

00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:12.798
this is not my forte along with
a lot of other things.

00:34:12.798 --> 00:34:18.367
All right, let's try it better.
Here's our better picture.

00:34:18.367 --> 00:34:22.666
Okay, there's the exponential.
At this point,

00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:26.965
I'm supposed to have a lecture
demonstration.

00:34:26.965 --> 00:34:34.000
It's supposed to go up on the
thing, so you can all see it.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.352
But then, you wouldn't be able
to copy it.

00:34:37.352 --> 00:34:40.377
So, at least we are on even
terms now.

00:34:40.377 --> 00:34:43.320
Okay, how does the actual curve
look?

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.937
Well, I'm just trying to be
fair.

00:34:45.937 --> 00:34:48.471
That's all.
Okay, after a while,

00:34:48.471 --> 00:34:51.823
the point is,
just so we have something to

00:34:51.823 --> 00:34:55.748
aim at, let's say,
okay, here we are going to go,

00:34:55.748 --> 00:35:00.000
we're going to get down through
there.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.763
Okay then, this is our better
curve.

00:35:03.763 --> 00:35:08.709
Okay, so I am a solution,
a particular solution

00:35:08.709 --> 00:35:12.258
satisfying this initial
condition.

00:35:12.258 --> 00:35:16.344
I started here,
and that was my initial

00:35:16.344 --> 00:35:20.645
velocity.
The slope of that thing gave me

00:35:20.645 --> 00:35:26.021
the initial velocity.
Now, the interesting question

00:35:26.021 --> 00:35:28.924
is, the first,
in some ways,

00:35:28.924 --> 00:35:35.161
the most interesting question,
though there will be others,

00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:42.139
too, is what is this spacing?
Well, that's a period.

00:35:42.139 --> 00:35:47.489
And now, it's half a period.
I clearly ought to think of

00:35:47.489 --> 00:35:51.866
this as the whole period.
So, let's call that,

00:35:51.866 --> 00:35:56.924
I'm going to call this pi over,
so this spacing here,

00:35:56.924 --> 00:36:01.787
from there to there,
I will call that pi divided by

00:36:01.787 --> 00:36:05.775
omega one because this,
from here to here,

00:36:05.775 --> 00:36:10.346
should be, I hope,
twice that, two pi over omega

00:36:10.346 --> 00:36:14.340
one.
Now, my question is,

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:18.787
so this, for a solution,
it's, in fact,

00:36:18.787 --> 00:36:24.404
is going to cross the axis
regularly in that way.

00:36:24.404 --> 00:36:28.617
My question is,
how does this period,

00:36:28.617 --> 00:36:34.000
so this is going to be its half
period.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:39.037
I will put period in quotation
marks because this isn't really

00:36:39.037 --> 00:36:43.828
a periodic function because it's
decreasing all the time in

00:36:43.828 --> 00:36:46.470
amplitude.
But, it's trying to be

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:49.609
periodic.
At lease it's doing something

00:36:49.609 --> 00:36:52.500
periodically.
It's crossing the axis

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.886
periodically.
So, this is the half period.

00:36:55.886 --> 00:37:00.428
Two pi over omega one
would be its full

00:37:00.428 --> 00:37:02.906
period.
What I want to know is,

00:37:02.906 --> 00:37:07.200
how does that half period,
or how does-- omega one is

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:13.347
called its pseudo-frequency.
This should really be called

00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:16.616
its pseudo-period.
Everything is pseudo.

00:37:16.616 --> 00:37:21.059
Everything is fake here.
Like, the amoeba has its fake

00:37:21.059 --> 00:37:24.832
foot and stuff like that.
Okay, so this is its

00:37:24.832 --> 00:37:27.431
pseudo-period,
pseudo-frequency,

00:37:27.431 --> 00:37:31.287
pseudo-circular frequency,
but that's hopeless.

00:37:31.287 --> 00:37:35.143
I guess it should be circular
pseudo-frequency,

00:37:35.143 --> 00:37:39.000
or I don't know how you say
that.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:46.333
I don't think pseudo is a word
all by itself,

00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:50.833
not even in 18.03,
circular.

00:37:50.833 --> 00:37:58.833
Okay, here's my question.
If the damping goes up,

00:37:58.833 --> 00:38:06.971
this is the damping term.
If the damping goes up,

00:38:06.971 --> 00:38:11.622
what happens to the
pseudo-frequency?

00:38:11.622 --> 00:38:19.373
The frequency is how often the
curve, this is high-frequency,

00:38:19.373 --> 00:38:23.377
and this is low-frequency,
okay?

00:38:23.377 --> 00:38:29.449
So, my question is,
which way does the frequency

00:38:29.449 --> 00:38:33.938
go?
If the damping goes up,

00:38:33.938 --> 00:38:38.026
does the frequency go up or
down?

00:38:38.026 --> 00:38:42.497
Down.
I mean, I'm just asking you to

00:38:42.497 --> 00:38:50.546
answer intuitively on the basis
of your intuition about how this

00:38:50.546 --> 00:38:55.017
thing explains,
how this thing goes,

00:38:55.017 --> 00:39:01.331
and now let's get the formula.
What, in fact,

00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:05.325
is omega one?
What is omega one?

00:39:05.325 --> 00:39:09.414
The answer is when I solve the
equation, so,

00:39:09.414 --> 00:39:13.598
r is now, so in other words,
if omega one is,

00:39:13.598 --> 00:39:18.067
sorry, if I have p,
if p is no longer zero as it

00:39:18.067 --> 00:39:22.061
was in the undamped case,
what is the root,

00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:25.389
now?
Okay, well, the root is minus p

00:39:25.389 --> 00:39:31.000
plus or minus the square root of
p squared, --

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.657
-- now I'm going to write it
this way, minus,

00:39:34.657 --> 00:39:38.481
to indicate that it's really a
negative number,

00:39:38.481 --> 00:39:42.637
omega squared minus p squared.

00:39:42.637 --> 00:39:47.375
Now, I'm going to call this,
because you see when I change

00:39:47.375 --> 00:39:52.030
this to sines and cosines,
the square root of this number

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:55.687
is what's going to become that
new frequency.

00:39:55.687 --> 00:40:00.841
I'm going to call that minus p
plus or minus the square root of

00:40:00.841 --> 00:40:06.220
minus omega one squared.
That's going to be the new

00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.269
frequency.
And therefore,

00:40:08.269 --> 00:40:13.479
the root is going to change so
that the corresponding solution

00:40:13.479 --> 00:40:15.272
is going to look,
how?

00:40:15.272 --> 00:40:20.482
Well, it's going to be e to the
negative pt times,

00:40:20.482 --> 00:40:25.093
let's write it out first in
terms of sines and cosines,

00:40:25.093 --> 00:40:29.363
times the cosine of,
well, the square root of omega

00:40:29.363 --> 00:40:35.000
one squared is omega one.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.213
But, there's an i out front
because of the negative sign in

00:40:39.213 --> 00:40:42.481
front of that.
So, it's going to be the cosine

00:40:42.481 --> 00:40:47.058
of omega one t
plus c2 times the sine of omega

00:40:47.058 --> 00:40:51.125
one t.
Or, if you prefer to write it

00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:54.830
out in the other form,
it's e to the minus p t times

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:57.881
some amplitude,
which depends on c1 and c2,

00:40:57.881 --> 00:41:02.384
times the cosine of omega one t
minus the phase lag.

00:41:02.384 --> 00:41:07.192
Now, when I do that,

00:41:07.192 --> 00:41:13.003
you see omega one is
this pseudo-frequency.

00:41:13.003 --> 00:41:17.717
In other words,
this number omega one is the

00:41:17.717 --> 00:41:23.089
same one that I identified here.
And, why is that?

00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:27.913
Well, because,
what are two successive times?

00:41:27.913 --> 00:41:33.066
Suppose it crosses,
suppose the solution crosses

00:41:33.066 --> 00:41:38.000
the x-axis, sorry,
y-- the t-axis.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.301
For the first time,
at the point t1,

00:41:42.301 --> 00:41:46.480
what's the next time it crosses
t2?

00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:51.027
Let's jump to the two times
across it.

00:41:51.027 --> 00:41:57.787
So, I want this to be a whole
period, not a half period.

00:41:57.787 --> 00:42:02.605
What's t2?
Well, I say that t2 is nothing

00:42:02.605 --> 00:42:07.121
but 2 pi divided by omega one.

00:42:07.121 --> 00:42:10.942
And, you can see that because
when I plug in,

00:42:10.942 --> 00:42:14.502
if it's zero,
if I have a point where it's

00:42:14.502 --> 00:42:18.844
zero, so, omega one t minus phi,

00:42:18.844 --> 00:42:22.231
when will it be zero for the
first time?

00:42:22.231 --> 00:42:26.486
Well, that will be when the
cosine has to be zero.

00:42:26.486 --> 00:42:30.221
So, it will be some multiple
of, it will be,

00:42:30.221 --> 00:42:35.551
say, pi over two.
Then, the next time this

00:42:35.551 --> 00:42:39.591
happens will be,
if that happens at t1,

00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:45.971
then the next time it happens
will be at t1 plus 2 pi divided

00:42:45.971 --> 00:42:49.586
by omega one.

00:42:49.586 --> 00:42:54.158
That will also be pi over two
plus how much?

00:42:54.158 --> 00:43:00.431
Plus 2 pi, which is the next
time the cosine gets around and

00:43:00.431 --> 00:43:05.640
is doing its thing,
becoming zero as it goes down,

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.609
not as it's coming up again.
In other words,

00:43:11.609 --> 00:43:17.618
this is what you should add to
the first time to get this

00:43:17.618 --> 00:43:23.304
second time that the cosine
becomes zero coming in the

00:43:23.304 --> 00:43:26.738
direction from top to the
bottom.

00:43:26.738 --> 00:43:30.922
So, this is,
in fact, the frequency with

00:43:30.922 --> 00:43:36.512
which it's crossing the axis.
Now, notice,

00:43:36.512 --> 00:43:41.806
I'm running out of boards.
What a disaster!

00:43:41.806 --> 00:43:46.470
In that expression,
take a look at it.

00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:50.882
I want to know what depends on
what.

00:43:50.882 --> 00:43:54.915
So, p, in that,
we got constants.

00:43:54.915 --> 00:43:57.436
We got p.
We got phi.

00:43:57.436 --> 00:44:00.714
We got A.
What else we got?

00:44:00.714 --> 00:44:07.699
Omega one.
What do these things depend

00:44:07.699 --> 00:44:11.300
upon?
You've got to keep it firmly in

00:44:11.300 --> 00:44:14.699
mind.
This depends only on the ODE.

00:44:14.699 --> 00:44:19.599
It's basically the damping.
It depends on c and m.

00:44:19.599 --> 00:44:23.500
Essentially, it's c over 2m

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:25.800
actually.
How about phi?

00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:30.199
Well, phi, what else depends
only on the ODE?

00:44:30.199 --> 00:44:36.000
Omega one depends
only on the ODE.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.395
What's the formula for omega
one?

00:44:38.395 --> 00:44:40.791
Omega one squared.

00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:43.636
Where do we have it?
Omega one squared,

00:44:43.636 --> 00:44:46.106
I never wrote the formula for
you.

00:44:46.106 --> 00:44:50.149
So, we have omega nought
squared minus p squared equals

00:44:50.149 --> 00:44:53.967
omega one squared.

00:44:53.967 --> 00:44:56.363
What's the relation between
them?

00:44:56.363 --> 00:45:00.481
That's the Pythagorean theorem.
If this is omega nought,

00:45:00.481 --> 00:45:04.000
then this omega one,
this is p.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.625
They make a little,
right triangle in other words.

00:45:09.625 --> 00:45:13.643
The omega one depends on the
spring.

00:45:13.643 --> 00:45:19.268
So, it's equal to,
well, it's equal to that thing.

00:45:19.268 --> 00:45:25.927
So, it depends on the damping.
It depends upon the damping,

00:45:25.927 --> 00:45:30.175
and it depends on the spring
constant.

00:45:30.175 --> 00:45:36.030
How about the phi and the A?
What do they depend on?

00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:42.000
They depend upon the initial
conditions.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.689
So, the mass of constants,
they have different functions.

00:45:47.689 --> 00:45:53.684
What's making this complicated
is that our answer needs four

00:45:53.684 --> 00:45:59.171
parameters to describe it.
This tells you how fast it's

00:45:59.171 --> 00:46:03.923
coming down.
This tells you the phase lag.

00:46:03.923 --> 00:46:08.763
This amplitude modifies,
it tells you whether the

00:46:08.763 --> 00:46:15.014
exponential curve starts going,
is like that or goes like this.

00:46:15.014 --> 00:46:18.442
And, finally,
the omega one is this

00:46:18.442 --> 00:46:22.576
pseudo-frequency,
which tells you how it's

00:46:22.576 --> 00:46:23.909
bobbing up and down.
