00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.980
Hello, everyone.

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.760
I'm Tei Shi.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.520
This is Bobby.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.770
We're going to be playing
some songs for you today.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.577
Thank you for having us in.

00:00:22.577 --> 00:00:23.410
This is really cool.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.970
Your office is kind of insane.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.957
In the best way possible.

00:00:30.957 --> 00:00:33.040
All right, we're going to
start with a song called

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.746
"Keep Running."

(SINGING) Every time I look over
my shoulder, I'm getting older.

00:00:56.205 --> 00:01:00.197
I'm getting older.

Every time I look over my
shoulder, I'm getting older.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.171
I'm getting older.

00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:15.666
Time is so sad.

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.654
Tie me to it.

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:27.576
Strapped to my side.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.050
Never look back.

00:01:38.034 --> 00:01:39.528
Baby, keep running.

00:01:39.528 --> 00:01:41.022
Keep running for me.

you see in your sleep.

Baby, keep running,
keep running for me.

00:01:55.962 --> 00:01:57.456
Don't hesitate.

00:01:57.456 --> 00:01:59.448
Don't make me wait.

00:01:59.448 --> 00:02:02.934
If you want my loving, then
you better start running.

It's awesome to be here.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.930
We played a show
last night as part

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.240
of Noise Pop, which is going on,
I think, all week in the city.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:14.750
And I love this city.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.390
It's really great to play here.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:22.070
So I'm glad we were able to come
in today and play for you guys.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.130
Thank you for being here.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.770

another song now.

00:04:42.237 --> 00:04:51.219
(SINGING) Baby, why
you trying to blame me?

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:55.710
Even though I'm
drying up on patience,

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.702
you know I'm the same me.

00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:08.185
Maybe we could try doing
something fun tonight.

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:15.154
We both know we're
running out of secrets.

00:05:15.154 --> 00:05:21.930
Only in the daylight we thrive.

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.232
Listen here.

00:05:25.232 --> 00:05:30.468
If you don't look at
me, I'll disappear.

00:05:30.468 --> 00:05:35.824
We can end this now with
a full house, take a bow,

00:05:35.824 --> 00:05:39.296
and shed a single tear.

00:05:39.296 --> 00:05:40.784
Oh, dear.

00:05:40.784 --> 00:05:42.768
But hold me close.

00:05:45.744 --> 00:05:50.240
And we can dance to the violins.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.110
Let me know.

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:57.886
I want to go down in silence.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:04.660
It's not personal.

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:09.600
Just wish I could
reverse it all.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.528
Give me something good,
and send a wink my way.

00:06:15.528 --> 00:06:20.962
If it hurts at all,
I'll start to fall.

00:06:20.962 --> 00:06:23.735
Sit tight.

00:06:23.735 --> 00:06:28.880
And dream about me all night.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:33.760
Take a dive and swim
inside a memory.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.225
Say everything is all right.

00:06:37.225 --> 00:06:38.710
Oh, my.

Oh, my.

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:52.570
Oh, whoa.

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:07.408
If you're in there, just
know that I am not scared.

00:07:07.408 --> 00:07:11.800
I'll take you by the
shoulder, squeeze them tight,

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:16.171
and shake you till I break you.

00:07:16.171 --> 00:07:18.103
Hey, you.

00:07:18.103 --> 00:07:26.832
To lose you is something
I refuse to do.

00:07:26.832 --> 00:07:29.950
If everything's
a choice in life,

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.390
just like they say,
well then, I choose you.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.740
Do, do.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:39.150

with the violins.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.515
Ah, ah, ah.

00:08:01.515 --> 00:08:05.507
And we can dance
with the violins.

00:08:05.507 --> 00:08:07.004
Let me know.

00:08:10.497 --> 00:08:15.487
I'll go down in silence.

Thank you.

00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:51.180
I think we're doing some
interview stuff now.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.305
SPEAKER 1: A few questions.

00:08:52.305 --> 00:08:55.109
A few questions for you.

00:08:55.109 --> 00:08:56.650
Once again, thank
you for being here.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.065
I think if we can give
another round of applause.

00:08:59.065 --> 00:09:02.460
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.020
So these are songs
off your new album

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.120
that came out about a year ago.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.980
And you just finished a tour.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.560
You came to San Francisco
just to do Noise Pop, which

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.990
is completely awesome.

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:16.580
But what was the progression
to make this album, which

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.657
is "Crawl Space"?

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:19.490
TEI SHI: Yeah, yeah.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:21.281
So all these songs that
we're playing today

00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:24.080
are off my debut album,
which came out, yeah,

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.240
almost a year ago.

00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.980
And the album was kind of
a culmination of a couple

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.260
of years of writing.

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.989
I had put out two
EPs before the album,

00:09:34.989 --> 00:09:36.530
and that's kind of
how I started out.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.130
I put out an EP of
songs I had written

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:41.780
when I was at music school.

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:45.140
And just kind of threw
them online and kind of got

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:48.080
into that online
blog world as it was,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.610
I think, kind of at its end.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:53.170
And yeah.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:55.850
And then I made a second
EP and just kind of started

00:09:55.850 --> 00:10:00.470
playing live and really getting
used to this whole performance

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:03.680
and actually putting music
out for other people to hear.

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.020
And so the album was kind of--

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:10.040
it's 12 songs and I spent
about a year and a half

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.780
to two years writing it right
after the second EP came out.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:20.200
And it's really just kind of
the emotional journey, I think,

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:24.370
of going from putting
my music out there,

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:27.520
and starting from a very naive
place and a very kind of just

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.950
DIY place, and then kind
of being thrown very

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:36.990
quickly into that experience of
having other people listening

00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.890
and judging, and other
people's opinions,

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:41.800
and getting used to
the music industry,

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.290
and working with other people
and just a lot of my ups

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:45.920
and downs through that process.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.910
And so the album kind of deals
with all of those emotions

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:53.350
and also a breakup that
happened around the time

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:55.210
I was finishing the album.

00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:57.580
And so there's some love
songs, and there's just

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:02.050
a lot of self-reflection
on it and a mix

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:05.559
of a lot of different sounds
and genres that I listen to.

00:11:05.559 --> 00:11:07.600
I like to listen to all
kinds of different music,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.980
so it's pretty eclectic.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.220
This is kind of a very different
arrangement of the songs, just

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.150
the guitar and vocals.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.680
But if you listen
to the recordings,

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.914
they're much more built out.

00:11:17.914 --> 00:11:18.580
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:19.840
It's a great album.

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.830
I don't know why I'm
bending over so much.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.010
No, it's a great album.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.600
And "Crawl Space"
actually has to do

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:29.140
with that coming out in there
and finding that safe space,

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.370
as you said.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:31.420
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.390
The album title, "Crawl
Space," was kind of

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:38.140
inspired by a couple of things.

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.710
It's symbolically a crawl space.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:45.610
It's this very small place
in your house that's cramped

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.910
and not a very nice
space to be in.

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:55.300
But I think,
emotionally, that idea

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:56.950
of a really small,
cramped space was

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:59.200
kind of how I felt
when I was working

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.240
on the album and dealing with
some kind of relationships

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:09.790
around me crumbling, and just
really having to reassess

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:14.890
my life and my surroundings
as I was actually making music

00:12:14.890 --> 00:12:17.140
my career, and all
the difficulties that

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:17.860
come with that.

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:23.656
And the crawl space also
has a double meaning for me,

00:12:23.656 --> 00:12:25.030
because when I
was really little,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.570
my family moved from Colombia to
Canada when I was about eight.

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.540
And we moved into a
house for the first time,

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.130
and it had this
crawl space in it,

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.080
which I'd never known
what that was before,

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.410
but I was really afraid of it.

00:12:36.410 --> 00:12:38.830
And I had a really
hard time at night--

00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:44.170
a lot of anxiety in the
nighttime and insomnia.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.197
And so I developed
this ritual of forcing

00:12:47.197 --> 00:12:49.780
myself to sit in the crawl space
for a minute every night just

00:12:49.780 --> 00:12:51.160
to kind of confront my fears.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:55.180
And then over the course of
the first year of being there,

00:12:55.180 --> 00:13:01.420
I got over those night
fears and that fear.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:03.520
And so that was a
lesson to myself.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:09.250
I learnt to confront my
anxieties and my fears really

00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.930
just head on to deal with them.

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:14.200
And making the album was
very much a process of that.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:16.930
I was really afraid
of this daunting idea

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:20.260
of putting out an album and
really presenting myself

00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:22.330
as an artist to people.

00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.610
And so the album was
a process of dealing

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.290
with those fears and
those insecurities

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.380
and coming out on the
other end feeling really

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:30.932
proud and confident about it.

00:13:30.932 --> 00:13:32.140
SPEAKER 1: I got to ask then.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.407
Is the tarantula real
that's on your face on the--

00:13:34.407 --> 00:13:34.990
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:35.600
SPEAKER 1: That's
a real tarantula?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.183
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:40.450
So the album cover and all
the artwork on the album is--

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:43.550
it's my face with
a tarantula on it.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:48.370
And that was another fear of
mine, as I'm sure most of you

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.900
can relate.

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.200
I just thought it
was a really, first

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.630
of all, like a cool visual,
because the album title "Crawl

00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:59.170
Space," I wanted to play off
of that very visceral, kind

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:03.740
of creepy, the word "crawl."

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:08.020
And so I thought of a tarantula,
which really scared me

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:10.270
at first, but I always
like a challenge.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.320
And I thought the visual
would be really amazing

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:17.350
and that there were some
images that I was inspired by.

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.530
There's this Michael
Jackson "Time" cover where

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.120
he has a tarantula on his face.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.430
And so I saw that
and I was just like,

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:29.990
yes, this is the
look that I want.

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:31.475
But it was a real tarantula.

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:32.350
SPEAKER 1: All right.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:33.850
Yeah, I could understand
that would be scary.

00:14:33.850 --> 00:14:34.540
TEI SHI: Yes.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.400
[LAUGHS]

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.750
SPEAKER 1: So you mentioned
you moved from Colombia,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.660
but you were born
in Buenos Aires.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.454
Lived in Colombia,
moved to Canada.

00:14:42.454 --> 00:14:44.620
You also said-- and I was
talking about this earlier

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:47.225
about the Shakira thing,
where you mentioned about one

00:14:47.225 --> 00:14:49.690
of your favorite albums growing
up was Shakira's second CD.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.350
I always forget its
name, because it's--

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:51.933
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.255
Well, there were a
couple of her early CDs.

00:14:54.255 --> 00:14:55.630
SPEAKER 1: That
you really liked.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:57.220
And when you describe
them, you say

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.920
it was like an early Alanis
Morissette, which I thought was

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.710
a very Canadian thing to say.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:03.940
But since then, you moved.

00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:06.040
Then you lived in New
York, and now you're in LA.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.623
Being in all these
areas, how has that

00:15:07.623 --> 00:15:09.760
really changed your
sound and influenced

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:10.915
what you're doing today?

00:15:10.915 --> 00:15:13.480
TEI SHI: I mean, I think
changing your surroundings

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.850
and your environment is the
main thing, at least for me.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:20.440
I think the main thing you can
do to really just keep yourself

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.140
stimulated, and
discovering who you are

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.320
and what things stay constant
when you change everything

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:31.300
around you, and what things
about you are really adaptable,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.250
and I think that
that's something really

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:35.510
important to do creatively.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:37.930
In music, for sure,
I think experiencing

00:15:37.930 --> 00:15:41.080
different cultures, different
languages, different genres

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.860
of music, different
ways of making music,

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.570
ways of performing.

00:15:46.570 --> 00:15:49.630
So for me, now
being able to travel

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.170
and moving around at this
point is really important.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:57.100
And it's just something
I grew up doing as well.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.720
Yeah, I was born in Argentina.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.950
My parents are Colombian.

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.170
And when I was two, we
moved back to Colombia

00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:05.440
and lived there until I was
eight, and then went to Canada.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.240
And since then,
I kind of grew up

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.070
in between Colombia and Canada.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.300
So I feel very much Colombian
and very much Canadian.

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.790
And I think that's just
kind of part of my identity,

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.680
just like feeling very
multi-faceted, I guess,

00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:21.550
in my background.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.690
And that's the way I like
to approach music too.

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:28.356
SPEAKER 1: So when you
say you started off

00:16:28.356 --> 00:16:29.980
putting your music
out there, I noticed

00:16:29.980 --> 00:16:33.040
that a lot of your early
shows were big festivals,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:37.690
like Coachella, and with some
pretty cool bands like Jungle,

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.610
who is amazing and
all that stuff.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:41.830
And now you're going
on your own tours.

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:45.840
How's that, knowing that people
now are here solely to see you?

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.620
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:16:47.620 --> 00:16:50.030
It's a pretty weird experience.

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:52.120
Yeah, I started
playing live really

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.650
just as a tool to help
get my music out there.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:01.180
And then I was really
lucky with my second EP,

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.589
to be able to tour
quite a bit off of that,

00:17:04.589 --> 00:17:07.920
and do festivals, and support
some really awesome bands

00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.060
and artists.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:13.710
So that kind of got
me just, I guess,

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:18.180
into the idea of standing
in front of people

00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:22.890
and being able to gauge also
what things connect with people

00:17:22.890 --> 00:17:24.329
in a live environment.

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:26.910
And festivals are very
different from venue shows,

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:28.119
and club shows are different.

00:17:28.119 --> 00:17:34.800
So all of these situations,
they require, I think,

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:39.180
experience, just to know
what to bring to the table

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.230
and what kind of set to
build around the songs.

00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.260
And so by the time
I made the album

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:49.320
and did the tour
around the album,

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:54.510
I was able to have a better
sense of what that's like,

00:17:54.510 --> 00:17:57.060
and know what I wanted
the show to be like,

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:01.650
and how I wanted the
audience to feel.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:05.070
Yeah, but it's a
pretty surreal thing.

00:18:05.070 --> 00:18:10.110
We did a really long
two-month tour in the fall.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:11.820
It ended in the end of October.

00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:16.300
And we toured quite a
bit throughout last year.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:18.540
So this show we did last
night was the first show we

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.990
played in months.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:24.090
And it's really kind of crazy
to just come to San Francisco,

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:27.360
and play a show, and see that
there's a bunch of people there

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.470
and they know the songs.

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:32.010
That is the thing that
just never fully clicks--

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.740
the idea that what you're
making and putting out

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.700
there is actually something
that people are connecting with

00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:41.497
and that they want to come see.

00:18:41.497 --> 00:18:43.830
I always feel, before a show,
no one's going to show up.

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:50.300
And I just don't understand
why this happens.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.500
But it's really amazing.

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:54.510
It's so much fun,
and it's really

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:57.910
fulfilling, especially
cities like San Francisco,

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.210
where the energy's
always really great.

00:19:01.210 --> 00:19:05.070
SPEAKER 1: Well, I think the
first song I heard of yours

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.080
was off of one of your EPs.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.840
And we talked to-- it's a song
which everyone should look up.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:12.690
It's a little racy,
but it's "Sickasfuck."

00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:13.747
It's a great song.

00:19:13.747 --> 00:19:16.080
And then you come out with
songs like "Keep On Running,"

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:16.960
which is beautiful.

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.820
And I've seen many different
acoustic versions you've done,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:24.390
which has just
been crazy vocals.

00:19:24.390 --> 00:19:25.210
What's next?

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:27.872
You just finished this
album, a year passed.

00:19:27.872 --> 00:19:29.080
Are you working on new stuff?

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.047
Or where are you going?

00:19:30.047 --> 00:19:30.630
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:32.630
So I actually just moved
over to the West Coast,

00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:35.010
so now I'm a Californian
just like you guys.

00:19:35.010 --> 00:19:35.970
SPEAKER 1: LA, though.

00:19:35.970 --> 00:19:40.880
TEI SHI: [LAUGHS] You got
to blow my cover like that?

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.650
Yeah.

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:44.910
Yes, I'm working on new music.

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:48.120
And we're continuing
to play the album

00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.200
and continuing to
get that out there.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.970
But trying to just
write some new music,

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:57.660
and figure out what the
next project will be,

00:19:57.660 --> 00:20:01.450
and just collaborate
with different people.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.330
Yeah, that's kind
of the next-- yeah.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:08.220
I mean, I'm hoping to get some
new music out soon and just

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.840
keep people interested.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:11.450
[LAUGHS]

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.400
SPEAKER 1: Where do you go
to find this inspiration?

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.810
Are you a movie watcher?

00:20:15.810 --> 00:20:17.790
Do you go to a whole
bunch of shows yourself?

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:20.790
Do you just like to
wander in the woods?

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:24.000
TEI SHI: I think it's a
combination of a lot of things.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.880
I think, like in anything,
in anything anybody does,

00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:31.050
you pick up little bits of
influence or inspiration

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:34.650
from very subtle things,
just as you live your life.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:37.350
So I love movies.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.510
I love visuals.

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:43.350
So I like to watch
a lot of movies.

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:46.470
I like to see shows
and theater, and just

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:48.600
see different forms
of performance.

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.640
That's really inspiring for me.

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:54.627
And then, obviously,
listening to music,

00:20:54.627 --> 00:20:56.460
and just listening to
music from other parts

00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:59.460
of the world and what
people are making outside

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.630
of the bubble of LA, New York.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:09.240
And yeah, I mean,
people inspire me.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.580
And I think, like I
said, the main thing

00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:16.250
is just having new experiences
and changing my environment.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:19.440
So moving out to
this coast, I think,

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.600
will be a very
different experience,

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.410
different kind of inspiration
than you get in New York.

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.810
And so I'm looking
forward to that and to see

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:30.446
how that influences the sound.

00:21:30.446 --> 00:21:32.820
SPEAKER 1: Well, besides "Crawl
Space," which is amazing,

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:36.860
what album should we
listen to that you,

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:40.119
right now, you just
can't stop listening to?

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:41.160
TEI SHI: That's a tough--

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.380
I always forget
everything when I

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:47.694
have people ask me about
what music I'm listening to.

00:21:47.694 --> 00:21:49.360
SPEAKER 1: It's OK
to say "Crawl Space."

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:51.682 --> 00:21:53.640
TEI SHI: Let's see what
I've been listening to.

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:01.130
I feel like I've
said this when people

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.240
ask me this question a
lot over the past year,

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.970
but there's this album by--

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:06.320
he's Canadian, actually.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.500
Andy Shauf, Shauf, is his name.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:14.570
And he's a multi-instrumentalist
singer-songwriter, produces

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.120
and engineers
everything he does.

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:16.970
He's one of those--

00:22:16.970 --> 00:22:19.820
just completely does
everything himself.

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:23.220
And his album
called "The Party,"

00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:25.340
it's a concept album about--

00:22:25.340 --> 00:22:28.100
basically, it takes you through
this party that he goes to.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.394
And he sings the songs
from different perspectives

00:22:31.394 --> 00:22:32.810
of the people
attending the party.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.010
And it's really good.

00:22:34.010 --> 00:22:36.710
It's really great music.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:37.700
He's amazing.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:39.800
And I think he's going
to really blow up.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.666
So you should check
out that album.

00:22:41.666 --> 00:22:44.750
SPEAKER 1: Besides us coaxing
you to come back and perform

00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:47.210
at Google, do you have
a time when you're going

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.220
to be around again, touring?

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:52.170
Or is that not set
too far in the future?

00:22:52.170 --> 00:22:54.927
The best way to find
you besides going to LA?

00:22:54.927 --> 00:22:56.870
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:59.530
Touring is always
kind of happening.

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:04.100
It's always just in flux,
depending on what comes up.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.900
Right now it's not a
super touring-heavy time

00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.440
just because I'm just
writing new material.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:15.080
But yeah, we'll be doing
stuff probably more

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.800
in the end of the summer
and the early fall.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.470
And you can always keep
up with what's going on

00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:23.060
on my socials and stuff.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:25.670
I always post about
shows and all that stuff.

00:23:25.670 --> 00:23:26.930
So definitely.

00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:30.796
I'm sure we'll be back
in this area soon.

00:23:30.796 --> 00:23:32.170
SPEAKER 1: Well,
that'd be great.

00:23:32.170 --> 00:23:34.128
Do you mind if we open
it up to some questions,

00:23:34.128 --> 00:23:36.955
if anybody has anything
that they're dying to ask?

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:40.370
Not even dying.

00:23:40.370 --> 00:23:41.712
No one came prepared.

00:23:41.712 --> 00:23:42.670
TEI SHI: Yeah, we got--

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:43.340
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:23:43.340 --> 00:23:44.180
Hi.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.020
TEI SHI: Hi.

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.090
AUDIENCE: So I was going
to say, the little sofa

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:48.916
there is repping
Vancouver and Edmonton.

00:23:48.916 --> 00:23:49.790
TEI SHI: Oh, amazing.

00:23:49.790 --> 00:23:52.250
AUDIENCE: My parents also
moved us to Vancouver

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.550
when I was eight, so I
understand this multi-identity

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.900
you're talking about.

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:59.430
So I have two questions.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:02.270
The first one was, to me,
the power of collaboration

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.430
is about bringing
something forward

00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:07.670
that can be transmuted
or transformed

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:12.260
when other people add
a perspective to it.

00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:14.060
But as a singer
and a songwriter,

00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:17.494
when you've got a
vision for something,

00:24:17.494 --> 00:24:19.160
when you bring it
forth to other people,

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.290
how do you manage
that collaboration,

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.560
how do you disagree
productively if people

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:28.100
are taking it in a direction
that isn't what you had wanted?

00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.089
And the second
question I had was--

00:24:30.089 --> 00:24:32.630
so one of the songs on "Crawl
Space" that I've been listening

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:34.430
to on repeat is "Creep."

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.370
And I think you've made so
many interesting choices

00:24:37.370 --> 00:24:39.800
with the distorted guitars
and all of the stuff.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:44.270
So how do you retain that vision
when you're doing a smaller,

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.389
not-electronic set?

00:24:47.389 --> 00:24:47.930
TEI SHI: Woo.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:48.930
OK.

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.300
That's a really good question.

00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:54.210
So for the first
part, collaboration

00:24:54.210 --> 00:24:59.590
is something that is completely
dependent on the people that

00:24:59.590 --> 00:25:01.120
are involved in the dynamic.

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.280
And the process is
always different.

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.420
But I think with writing
and making music,

00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.840
making something new with
someone, it's very kind of easy

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.080
to gauge when you first
are in a room with someone

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:16.810
and trying to do something kind
of where that's going to go,

00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:24.040
and whether your vision or
your opinion is something

00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:25.909
that they're going to
help bring to life,

00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:27.700
or whether they're
bringing their own thing

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:30.270
and they're kind of just
shutting your ideas out.

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:32.410
So I think the first
phase is always

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.490
kind of figuring out
whether the dynamic works.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.680
And then from that
point, it really

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.590
just depends on the
people involved.

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:49.090
A lot of the times, I like to
bring a song idea to someone

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:52.120
and have the bones of the song--

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:57.400
the melodies, and the vocals,
and the lyrics-- and the song

00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.330
written somewhat.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.430
And then build on that.

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.330
And usually, for me,
the way I like to work

00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:10.060
is to show whoever I'm working
with what I've been inspired

00:26:10.060 --> 00:26:13.000
by lately and what I'm
listening to, and kind of just

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.750
give them a taste of, I guess,
my mood board, let's say,

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:21.820
of what I'm into or what I want
to bring into this song, what

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.170
I want to reference.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.050
And usually we'll just
listen to a bunch of stuff

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:27.010
and go back and forth.

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:30.880
And then it kind of just
happens really naturally.

00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:36.760
But I think it's just about
finding the right person who

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.780
understands who you are, and
understands where you're coming

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:45.070
from, and your
background, and then

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:49.450
who is willing to
explore with you

00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:54.520
but also let you
lead the way as well.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:58.030
That's, I think,
for me, the best way

00:26:58.030 --> 00:27:01.180
that collaboration can work.

00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.480
And then your second
question, which I'm now,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.666
like, blanking on--

00:27:07.666 --> 00:27:09.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:11.380
TEI SHI: Oh, yeah.

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.090
Yeah.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:13.630
It's tough.

00:27:13.630 --> 00:27:16.480
It's tough translating,
especially because

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:19.990
with the recorded music,
you spend so much time

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.870
creating something.

00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:26.110
This album I worked
on throughout a pretty

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:27.590
drawn out period of time.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.780
And so the songs, over time,
became these very solidified

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:34.465
things that were, to
me, their own worlds

00:27:34.465 --> 00:27:36.340
that I didn't really
want to step outside of.

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:40.750
So on the one hand,
making the live show--

00:27:40.750 --> 00:27:44.350
we have a full, live band
that we play the show with,

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.960
so we're able to really
stay true to the recordings,

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:53.140
but give them that
live, played element.

00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.720
But when it comes to
really stripping things

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.980
down like this, actually,
I haven't done a ton of it

00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:02.170
and we've kind of just
been figuring it out

00:28:02.170 --> 00:28:04.150
as we go with this album.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:07.510
But I think it's really about
letting the songwriting,

00:28:07.510 --> 00:28:11.080
letting the melody
and the vocal kind of

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:17.360
sit where it sits in a
way that you can identify.

00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.040
It feels like the same
song, but also arranging it

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:28.180
in a way with the guitar
giving it a different feel,

00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.820
changing some of the
chords, or giving

00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:34.240
the song a different feeling
and a different pace,

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:38.530
but letting the vocal kind
of carry the song the way

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.410
you know it.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:42.050
And yeah.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:46.710
I mean, it's fun.

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:51.030
It's hard to actually
attempt to translate

00:28:51.030 --> 00:28:54.120
everything that's going on
in a recording with this.

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:59.340
But I think that this experience
has actually kind of informed

00:28:59.340 --> 00:29:01.260
my songwriting now, too.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:03.330
I think about that a
little bit more now

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.070
when I'm writing new material.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:06.990
How is this going
to translate if it's

00:29:06.990 --> 00:29:08.190
just a guitar and vocal?

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:12.450
And it's made me focus more
on the songwriting and really

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.860
making a song that, it feels
like it can stand on its own

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.810
with just a guitar
and doesn't really

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:25.510
need all of that production to
feel like it has an identity.

00:29:25.510 --> 00:29:26.930
Yeah.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:29.630
Thanks.

00:29:29.630 --> 00:29:32.160
SPEAKER 1: Got anybody
else coming out, coming up?

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:33.354
Yeah.

00:29:33.354 --> 00:29:35.020
AUDIENCE: I'm usually
on the other side,

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.436
so I hope the sound
is acceptable.

00:29:36.436 --> 00:29:38.790
[LAUGHS] Tei Shi--

00:29:38.790 --> 00:29:41.490
I'm assuming it's a
derivative of your last name.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:43.110
Is there any special
story behind it?

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.860
Is it a nickname?

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:44.707
Or--

00:29:44.707 --> 00:29:45.540
TEI SHI: Not really.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:49.670
It's kind of just an abstract
take on my last name.

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:55.860
And yeah, it just kind of popped
into my head and it stuck.

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.750
There's no big
meaning behind it.

00:29:57.750 --> 00:29:59.480
AUDIENCE: Choosing a name is
one of the hardest things to do.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:29:59.970
TEI SHI: Yeah, exactly.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:02.760
I think you just kind of have
to throw something at the wall

00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.080
and just let it--

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:04.580
yeah.

00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:10.584
[LAUGHS] Yeah, sorry, there's
no good story behind that.

00:30:10.584 --> 00:30:12.000
SPEAKER 1: Well,
I have a question

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.280
about the story behind the
child on "Crawl Space,"

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:18.930
the person who comes in there.

00:30:18.930 --> 00:30:19.850
Is that you?

00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:22.650
And if not-- those
are recordings of you.

00:30:25.219 --> 00:30:26.010
That's interesting.

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.050
Did you feel embarrassed to
put in the part about how you

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:29.216
wanted to be Britney Spears?

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:32.660
Because it's totally valid.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:32.940
TEI SHI: No.

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.020
SPEAKER 1: I understand.

00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:35.395
TEI SHI: So
throughout the album,

00:30:35.395 --> 00:30:38.970
there's these little
snippets of tape recordings.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:41.400
So kind of around
that same time--

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:45.540
I talked about when
we moved to Canada--

00:30:45.540 --> 00:30:50.100
I started learning how to
record myself on a cassette tape

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.350
just on a boom box my
sister passed down to me.

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.030
And she kind of showed me
how I could record myself.

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:59.760
And so I would just sing and
make up songs, and also just

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.800
kind of talk to myself.

00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.880
It became kind of like
a diary type thing.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:05.540
And so I had these tape
cassettes sitting around

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:06.040
forever.

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.270
And I found them when I
was working on the album,

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:13.810
and so I integrated some
parts of them into the album.

00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:17.610
And yeah, so that's me just
kind of talking to myself.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:21.890
For the most part,
at that point,

00:31:21.890 --> 00:31:24.320
I really dreamed of being
a singer and a performer,

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.830
but I was very young and the
idea I had of being a singer

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:29.630
was Britney Spears.

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:34.070
That was kind of the female
performer/singer when I was

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:36.500
young that I was looking to.

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:41.150
So there was a lot of me
talking about Britney Spears

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:43.670
and how I wanted to be
a singer really badly.

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:48.320
But then also kind of really
kind of beating myself up

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.990
about how I wasn't good
enough and I had to be better.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.920
And it was just funny to
me to listen back on those

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:59.150
and see that I was going
through these very ups

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.532
and downs and
these insecurities,

00:32:01.532 --> 00:32:02.990
but also these big
ambitions that I

00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:05.920
think I can still really relate
to at this point in my life.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.120
And yeah.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.840
So they resonated with
me, especially at the time

00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.770
when I was making
the album and just

00:32:15.770 --> 00:32:22.160
kind of dealing with this
weird idea of putting myself

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:28.100
completely out there and
wanting to be better.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:31.550
SPEAKER 1: So could we assume
then that somewhere out there

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:33.455
are recordings of you
singing Britney Spears?

00:32:33.455 --> 00:32:33.955
[LAUGHS]

00:32:33.955 --> 00:32:36.560
TEI SHI: Oh yeah,
there's a lot of that.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.400
I didn't include any of the
parts where I was singing.

00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:44.960
Yeah, the parts on the
album are just spoken parts.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.680
But yeah, there's a [LAUGHS]
lot of Britney Spears,

00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:52.050
Mariah Carey, all that stuff.

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:55.130
SPEAKER 1: So you have
one song and only one

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:56.300
that's in all Spanish.

00:33:00.690 --> 00:33:02.460
A lot of music in
the United States

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:05.310
is only in English,
for the vast majority.

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:08.160
There are a good
following for other forms.

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:11.824
But was there any question
about doing that song--

00:33:11.824 --> 00:33:12.990
should I have that in there?

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.948
Or was that something
like, this song is great,

00:33:14.948 --> 00:33:17.207
I need to put it in there,
I want to represent this?

00:33:17.207 --> 00:33:17.790
TEI SHI: Yeah.

00:33:17.790 --> 00:33:20.250
I mean, I never really
thought about it as like an,

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:25.105
oh, this is in Spanish
and that's a thing.

00:33:25.105 --> 00:33:29.046
I had written that song and I'd
had that song floating around.

00:33:29.046 --> 00:33:30.420
Actually, I think
that's probably

00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:33.010
one of the first songs I wrote
that ended up on the album.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.970
And I had it floating
around for a long time,

00:33:35.970 --> 00:33:37.560
and I wanted to do
something with it.

00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.620
And as I worked on it and
finished it, I really loved it.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:45.750
And I thought it fit into
the sound of the album

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.910
but it also presented
another side that's

00:33:47.910 --> 00:33:51.690
a little more organic-sounding.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:56.250
There's more live
instrumentation on it.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:05.070
And also, my Spanish,
my Latin background

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.050
is a really big
part of who I am,

00:34:07.050 --> 00:34:13.020
and I always wanted to write and
release more music in Spanish.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:16.409
I just was kind of
waiting to write something

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:21.179
that I wanted to put out, and
that just happened to be that.

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:21.699
But yeah.

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.270
Yeah, I never really
thought about it too much.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.237
Once I decided it was
going to be on the album,

00:34:29.237 --> 00:34:30.070
it was on the album.

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:32.931
And I think I've really enjoyed
being able to sing in Spanish

00:34:32.931 --> 00:34:34.889
and also have people that
come to the shows who

00:34:34.889 --> 00:34:36.780
speak Spanish sing along.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:39.929
And they really love that
song, because they can relate

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:41.190
to it in a different way.

00:34:41.190 --> 00:34:47.969
And I'll definitely be putting
out more music in Spanish.

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:49.873
That kind of opened
the doors, I think.

00:34:49.873 --> 00:34:50.580
SPEAKER 1: Nice.

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.889
And I think you have
one more song for us.

00:34:52.889 --> 00:34:55.139
TEI SHI: Yeah, we're actually
going to play that song.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:56.250
SPEAKER 1: Oh.

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:56.850
Lucky me.

00:34:56.850 --> 00:34:59.645
TEI SHI: So thank you
for presenting that song.

00:34:59.645 --> 00:35:01.370
SPEAKER 1: Well, with that.

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:04.800
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.476
TEI SHI: So this song
is called "Como Si."

00:35:08.476 --> 00:35:09.964
[CLEARS THROAT]

00:35:13.932 --> 00:35:17.404
[GUITAR PLAYING]

00:35:18.396 --> 00:35:22.364
[SINGING IN SPANISH]

00:38:41.031 --> 00:38:44.863
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

00:38:44.863 --> 00:38:47.799
Thank you so much.

00:38:47.799 --> 00:38:49.590
SPEAKER 1: Once again,
thank you, everyone.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:50.399
Thank you, Tei Shi.

00:38:50.399 --> 00:38:51.190
TEI SHI: Thank you.

00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:51.994
Thanks for coming.

00:38:51.994 --> 00:38:54.160
SPEAKER 1: Want to also
mention Bobby on the guitar.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.510
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]
