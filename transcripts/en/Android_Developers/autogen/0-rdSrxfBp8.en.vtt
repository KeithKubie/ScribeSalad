the energy in that flywheel more buyers
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.830
the energy in that flywheel more buyers
equals more sellers more sellers equals

the morning we're thinking about
 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.830
the morning we're thinking about
building energy in that ecosystem that's

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840

we think about the commerce platform so
 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.400
we think about the commerce platform so
number one is reach in that previous

number one is reach in that previous
slide we had the word ubiquitous and the

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210
slide we had the word ubiquitous and the
 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.050
slide we had the word ubiquitous and the
word global our business is both Android

word global our business is both Android
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.880
word global our business is both Android
is built on massive massive reach well

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890
is built on massive massive reach well
 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.800
is built on massive massive reach well
over a billion users out there we aim to

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810
over a billion users out there we aim to
 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.420
over a billion users out there we aim to
make it possible for every one of those

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
make it possible for every one of those
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.130
make it possible for every one of those
users to transact on Google Play and

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140
users to transact on Google Play and
 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.570
users to transact on Google Play and
it's only a little bit more about the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
it's only a little bit more about the
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.640
it's only a little bit more about the
things that we do in that space the

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
things that we do in that space the
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980
things that we do in that space the
second is conversion once you've built

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990
second is conversion once you've built
 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.620
second is conversion once you've built
an app or built Senecas an experience

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
an app or built Senecas an experience
 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.630
an app or built Senecas an experience
that is causing the user to enter a

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640
that is causing the user to enter a
 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.300
that is causing the user to enter a
transaction flow our team makes sure

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
transaction flow our team makes sure
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.679
transaction flow our team makes sure
that the user comes at the end of that

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689
that the user comes at the end of that
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.569
that the user comes at the end of that
transaction flow having made a purchase

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579
transaction flow having made a purchase
 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.880
transaction flow having made a purchase
so conversion is a huge huge deal we

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890
so conversion is a huge huge deal we
 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.560
so conversion is a huge huge deal we
have a whole team of people again when

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570
have a whole team of people again when
 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.580
have a whole team of people again when
they're brushing their teeth in the

they're brushing their teeth in the
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.630
they're brushing their teeth in the
morning they're thinking about how to

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640
morning they're thinking about how to
 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.539
morning they're thinking about how to
increase conversion in your apps we also

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549
increase conversion in your apps we also
 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.190
increase conversion in your apps we also
think about trust actually David who

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200
think about trust actually David who
 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.390
think about trust actually David who
leads the trust team is going to be

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400
leads the trust team is going to be
 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.270

giving a talk on what equals Fair Play
 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.580
giving a talk on what equals Fair Play
later on today this ecosystem is built

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590
later on today this ecosystem is built
 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.200
later on today this ecosystem is built
on repeat transactions our users make

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
on repeat transactions our users make
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.179
on repeat transactions our users make
tens hundreds sometimes thousands of

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189
tens hundreds sometimes thousands of
 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.280
tens hundreds sometimes thousands of
transactions in the ecosystem this is

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290
transactions in the ecosystem this is
 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.530
transactions in the ecosystem this is
real money these are real experiences we

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540
real money these are real experiences we
 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510
real money these are real experiences we
were like a retail platform we have to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
were like a retail platform we have to
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280
were like a retail platform we have to
build and maintain trust for our users

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290
build and maintain trust for our users
 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.319
build and maintain trust for our users
and so we focus hard on that and then

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
and so we focus hard on that and then
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.480
and so we focus hard on that and then
the last tenet is growth like we believe

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490
the last tenet is growth like we believe
 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.770
the last tenet is growth like we believe
that there are things that Google Play

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780
that there are things that Google Play
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.870
that there are things that Google Play
can do to drive energy in this ecosystem

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880
can do to drive energy in this ecosystem
 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520
can do to drive energy in this ecosystem
we can put the right offers in front of

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
we can put the right offers in front of
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.050
we can put the right offers in front of
the right users at the right times and

the right users at the right times and
 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729
the right users at the right times and
so we've got a growth team that's also

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739
so we've got a growth team that's also
 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.520
so we've got a growth team that's also
focusing on building that well

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530
focusing on building that well
 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.820
focusing on building that well
energy in that flywheel so we talked

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830
energy in that flywheel so we talked
 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.890
energy in that flywheel so we talked
about reach so we have huge huge huge

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900
about reach so we have huge huge huge
 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.870
about reach so we have huge huge huge
reach the stuff is hard so we have

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
reach the stuff is hard so we have
 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.640
reach the stuff is hard so we have
transactions enabled in over 130

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650
transactions enabled in over 130
 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.699
transactions enabled in over 130
countries and we have lots and lots of

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709
countries and we have lots and lots of
 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.590
countries and we have lots and lots of
local forms of payment so credit cards

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600
local forms of payment so credit cards
 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.510
local forms of payment so credit cards
are great that's awesome but the fact of

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520
are great that's awesome but the fact of
 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.920
are great that's awesome but the fact of
the matter is that there's a huge number

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930
the matter is that there's a huge number
 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.630
the matter is that there's a huge number
of users out there who do not have

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640
of users out there who do not have
 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.640
of users out there who do not have
access to a credit card and we need to

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650
access to a credit card and we need to
 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.110
access to a credit card and we need to
make it possible for those users to

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120

we announced that we've crossed over 100
 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.900
we announced that we've crossed over 100
carriers just a few months later where

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750
where the reach team comes into account
 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.079
where the reach team comes into account
so the two things the one is do we have

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:07.089
so the two things the one is do we have
 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:08.850
so the two things the one is do we have
access to a form of payment that the

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860
access to a form of payment that the
 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.409
access to a form of payment that the
user also has access to and that's where

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419
user also has access to and that's where
 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:11.790
user also has access to and that's where
the store carrier billing comes into

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800

countries we have local forms of payment
 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.399
countries we have local forms of payment
in other countries so does the user have

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409
in other countries so does the user have
 

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:21.990
in other countries so does the user have
access to a form of payment is a huge

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000
access to a form of payment is a huge

experience and those users also converts
at much much higher rate

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400
at much much higher rate

trials but a lot of the time what you

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:27.710
trials but a lot of the time what you
 

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.530
trials but a lot of the time what you
actually want is a highly qualified user

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540
actually want is a highly qualified user
 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:31.150
actually want is a highly qualified user
so you don't want it to be entirely free

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.160
so you don't want it to be entirely free
 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.710
so you don't want it to be entirely free
but you do want a very low price for

involuntary churn and fighting

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:31.250
involuntary churn and fighting
 

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.100
involuntary churn and fighting
involuntary churn there are two main

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:33.110
involuntary churn there are two main
 

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:35.110
involuntary churn there are two main
things that you can do in the space so

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:35.120
things that you can do in the space so
 

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.850
things that you can do in the space so
the one is retries and so we've got a

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:36.860
the one is retries and so we've got a
 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.260
the one is retries and so we've got a
retries team that's figuring out the

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.270
retries team that's figuring out the
 

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.900
retries team that's figuring out the
right ways to retry the charges now

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:40.910
right ways to retry the charges now
 

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:42.760
right ways to retry the charges now
because we have so many different forms

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:42.770
because we have so many different forms
 

00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:43.990
because we have so many different forms
of payment in so many different

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.000
of payment in so many different
 

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.520
of payment in so many different
countries the regulations change the

countries the regulations change the
 

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.740
countries the regulations change the
rules change and frankly the

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:47.750
rules change and frankly the
 

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.759
rules change and frankly the
interactions with those payment forms of

00:08:49.759 --> 00:08:49.769
interactions with those payment forms of
 

00:08:49.769 --> 00:08:51.139
interactions with those payment forms of
Peyman change as well so this team is

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:51.149
Peyman change as well so this team is
 

00:08:51.149 --> 00:08:53.689
Peyman change as well so this team is
figuring out exactly the right time to

00:08:53.689 --> 00:08:53.699
figuring out exactly the right time to
 

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.579
figuring out exactly the right time to
retry a charge when to retry it how

00:08:55.579 --> 00:08:55.589
retry a charge when to retry it how
 

00:08:55.589 --> 00:08:57.859
retry a charge when to retry it how
often to retry it to get the highest

00:08:57.859 --> 00:08:57.869
often to retry it to get the highest
 

00:08:57.869 --> 00:08:59.989
often to retry it to get the highest
recovery rate possible through retries

00:08:59.989 --> 00:08:59.999
recovery rate possible through retries
 

00:08:59.999 --> 00:09:02.119
recovery rate possible through retries
and then the second thing that we do to

00:09:02.119 --> 00:09:02.129
and then the second thing that we do to
 

00:09:02.129 --> 00:09:03.979
and then the second thing that we do to
fight involuntary churn is we actually

00:09:03.979 --> 00:09:03.989
fight involuntary churn is we actually
 

00:09:03.989 --> 00:09:06.169
fight involuntary churn is we actually
reach out to the users sometimes the

00:09:06.169 --> 00:09:06.179
reach out to the users sometimes the
 

00:09:06.179 --> 00:09:07.549
reach out to the users sometimes the
retries just not going to work that form

00:09:07.549 --> 00:09:07.559
retries just not going to work that form
 

00:09:07.559 --> 00:09:09.739
retries just not going to work that form
of payment is broken and so we need to
