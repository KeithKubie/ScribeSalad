00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:13.400
- We are the paradoxical ape, bipedal,
naked, large brain. Long the master of

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.680
fire, tools, and language but still trying
to understand ourselves. Aware that death

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:31.090
is inevitable, yet filled with optimism.
We grow up slowly. We hand down knowledge,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.482
we empathize and deceive, we shape the
future from our shared understanding

00:00:38.482 --> 00:00:45.322
from the past. Carta brings together
experts from diverse disciplines to

00:00:45.322 --> 00:00:50.477
exchange insights on who we are and
how we got here.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:55.505
An exploration made possible by the
generosity of humans like you.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.634
- Thanks very much and thanks all
of you for coming.

00:02:03.634 --> 00:02:07.804
It's wonderful to be here and talk
to such an incredible audience.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.632
I thought I'd start off by posing
a question I think

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:18.320
is particularly relevant to all of us
thinking about language evolution and that

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:25.910
is what's so special about language. In a
sense the goal of evolutionary linguistics

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.800
is to try and explain the origins of the
special properties of language. They're

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.113
are two that I want to focus on today, in
fact Roger started with one of them.

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:47.260
First off I want to highlight structure.
Language has a highly unusual and rich

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.870
systematic structure in the way it's put
together. So when I say the phrase

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.070
"two boots" you're able to relate to the
acoustic wave form that hits your ears to

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.890
this rather cute picture of my son's shoes
on this slide. Now how are you able to do

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.370
that? You're able to do that because of
the special structure that language has.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.630
The signals that we produce are
constructed sequences of these meaningless

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.500
elements. We call them phonyms, these
different phonyms are put together in

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.250
different ways, reorganized in different
ways to make up the sounds of our language

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.330
in sequences. But further more these
meaningless elements are themselves put

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.840
together to make more morphemes, the
meaning carrying elements of language,

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.690
These are put together to construct
meaningful holes. So you understand what

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.740
two boots means because you understand the
ways in which language recombines

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.070
elements. It's because of this
recombination, because we can endlessly

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.723
recombine elements at these
two different levels that

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:01.465
we are able to talk about anything.

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.664
So we're able to constantly reproduce
completely new utterances

00:04:05.664 --> 00:04:08.936
with a happier expectation that
everyone can understand us.

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:14.040
This is an incredible feat and
remarkably it seems to

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.720
be unique to our species. So that was one
of the special features of language

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:28.770
structure. Next up, the other one I want
to talk about is learning. We are able to

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.730
use language because we have learned both
how to produce the signals in our language

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.346
and we've also learned perhaps
even more remarkably

00:04:36.346 --> 00:04:38.679
what the signals in our language mean.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.210
We're able to use language meaningfully
because we've observed language being used

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:51.190
around us as we grow up. Again this
combination of learning the signals and

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.060
learning the meanings seems to be unique
in nature. What I'm particularly

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.990
interested in is the fact that this is a
very particular kind of learning. When we

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.390
learn language we're learning from the
product of other people who have gone

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.580
through the same learning process. We
learn from the observation from the of the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.317
output of other learners. This is
something that I call iterated learning

00:05:16.317 --> 00:05:23.800
and it's a particular and relatively
unusual process in nature. What iterated

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.800
learning means is the language that
I speak and I learned by observing

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.310
language being produced by my parents and
the language that I produce is going on

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.421
to affect my son and daughter are
acquiring. What this means is we have

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.581
this process of cultural transmission of
language through this mapping from

00:05:45.581 --> 00:05:51.801
external production of language and some
internal representation of language.

00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:59.037
What this means is that languages evolve,
so this is a kind of cultural evolution.

00:05:59.037 --> 00:06:05.674
So language itself is an evolutionary
system in its own right.

00:06:06.568 --> 00:06:10.070
What I want to suggest today that these
two features, structure and iterated

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:17.030
learning are related to each other. In
fact what I want to claim is language

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.490
structure is the inevitable consequence of
the fact that language is a culturally

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:30.310
evolving system. So I want to pose and
answer this question affirmatively that

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.910
cultural evolution can explain why
language has the structure that it does.

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:39.560
How on earth can we go about answering
this question? This is one of the

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.940
challenges of doing evolutionary
linguistics is how on earth do you study

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.020
it scientifically? Well they're lots of
ways and you're going to hear about a lot

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.140
of them today. One of the ways that we
pioneered in my lab in Edinburgh was try

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.750
and recreate language evolution, the
cultural evolution of language in the

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.700
experiment lab. I'm going to show you how
we do that, I'm going to give you two

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.300
examples of two experiments that we've
done that will give you a flavor of the

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.258
way in which we can study cultural
evolution of language in the lab.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:18.790
Generally how do we do this? We brought
together two kind of standard experimental

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:24.070
techniques from two different areas. One
was a paradigm from psycho-linguistics

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:28.408
called artificial  language learning where
we get participants into the lab

00:07:28.408 --> 00:07:31.718
and teach them miniature
languages then test them.

00:07:32.494 --> 00:07:37.371
Another technique from experimental
anthropology, I guess you would call it

00:07:37.371 --> 00:07:39.940
called transmission chain paradigm and

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.100
this is the way people study the process
of cultural evolution in various different

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.650
domains. So we're just plucking those two
together. I'll talk you through in general

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:55.350
how it works and then I'll give you the
two specific examples. First off we bring

00:07:55.530 --> 00:08:00.030
our participant into the lab and we ask
them to learn a miniature language.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:05.281
So this is a very, very small miniature,
artificial language that we've created.

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:11.330
We might have them in the lab for an hour
maximum and then we test them. We get them

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:18.140
to produce utterances in this miniature
language. At this stage this is a standard

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.190
paradigm artificial language learning
paradigm. But the twist we put on it is we

00:08:23.370 --> 00:08:29.320
use the output of that participant when we
test them to form the language that the

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:34.600
next participant in the lab is going to
learn from. Then we take the output of

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:39.380
that second participant and use that to
form the input and training data for the

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.530
third participant in the lab and so on. So
we create a chain of transmission of this

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:50.390
miniature language and watch how it
evolves as it passes from participant to

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:57.390
participant in our experiments. What we
typically do is we start with a language

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.750
in scare quotes that is random and
unstructured. It doesn't have the

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:05.930
structural properties that we're
interested in and then we want to see if

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.390
the structural properties emerge through
this process of transmission over these

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:17.990
artificial generations that we created in
the lab experiments. Okay, so that's the

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.410
general structure of this experimental
approach and I'm going to give you two

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:29.500
examples. So first example and this is
joint work with Hanna Cornish and Kenny

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:36.170
Smith, pictured there. This was our first
experiment, the first experiment we did in

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:42.110
our lab. As you can see 2008,
it's a relatively recent approach that

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:46.670
we've taken here. What we wanted to do was
look for this emergence of compositional

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.020
structure. Compositional structure is the
idea that you can put words together to

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:56.540
make meanings, so the meaning of a whole
expression is made up the meanings of part

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.476
of that expression. So we wanted to see if
we could get back to

00:10:00.476 --> 00:10:03.978
a merge in these lab experiments.

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.430
Okay, so what participants did, so we have
this experimental chain of participants

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.010
and what the participants were asked to do
was learn a miniature language.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:20.790
The language was made of of these weird
meanings which were colored shapes that

00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:26.720
were moving in different ways and we have
three colors, three shapes, and three

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.820
different types of movement. So three
times three times three that makes 27

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.400
possible meanings in this language, when I
say miniature language I really mean

00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:41.757
miniature. These pictures, these
meanings were paired with

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:43.354
strings of syllables and these were

00:10:43.354 --> 00:10:47.900
just made up at random by the computer.
This is a completely unstructured,

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:53.640
arbitrary language, every single meaning
was given a different label and each

00:10:53.820 --> 00:11:00.380
participant was trained on half of the
language but then was tested on all of the

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.460
meanings. So they were trained on half of
the meanings but then were asked to

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:11.900
produce strings of syllables for all of
the meanings when we tested them. There

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:15.518
There output then formed the
input for the next participant

00:11:15.518 --> 00:11:17.478
in the lab and again we took a
random half of the

00:11:17.478 --> 00:11:21.100
output of the first participant to
train the second one and

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.680
then test the second one and then take a
random half of their language to train the

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:33.500
third participant and so on down the
chain. So what happens? Well what we find

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:43.590
is the people are absolutely terrible at
this task. This graph shows error and it's

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:48.629
a rather forgiving measure of error. It
just said an error of one would mean that

00:11:48.629 --> 00:11:54.570
you got not a single letter right in the
target word, an error of zero means you

00:11:54.750 --> 00:11:59.650
get everything right. What you see here is
four different runs of the experiment and

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:02.361
each point on this graph is a
different participant.

00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:07.210
The first participants in the lab had a
terrible time, in fact nobody got a single

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:14.680
word exactly right, essentially absolutely
awful. By the end however the

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.786
participants in the later
generations in these chains

00:12:18.786 --> 00:12:21.705
some of them were getting
everything exactly right

00:12:22.694 --> 00:12:28.840
including the meanings that they weren't
trained on. So they were successfully

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:36.150
guessing the correct label for meanings
that we didn't even train them on. So how

00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.730
on earth is that happening? Well I'll show
you what the languages looked like as they

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:46.130
evolved. So here's an initial random
language, so for example in this table

00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:50.805
"miniki" is the word for a blue square
that's moving horizontally.

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:55.144
Bear in mind if you're
trained on half of this language,

00:12:55.144 --> 00:12:57.840
imagine if I blanked out half
of these words and

00:12:57.840 --> 00:13:02.304
then I asked you to reconstruct the
missing words you'd have no hope, you

00:13:02.304 --> 00:13:07.090
couldn't possibly get it right because
this is random. If you didn't know that

00:13:07.270 --> 00:13:10.218
that word was "miniki" there's no way you
could guess it so that's

00:13:10.218 --> 00:13:14.346
why they're doing so badly. This
is what that same language

00:13:14.346 --> 00:13:21.424
looks like ten generations later.
So now you see how the

00:13:21.424 --> 00:13:26.440
participants are doing this. So now if I
blanked off half of those words you'd be

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:29.900
able to successfully guess what those
missing words were. For example the word

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:38.140
"poi" now refers to all spiraling objects.
This language has evolved to become more

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.950
easy to learn but it's evolved in a
slightly kind of disappointing way from

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:49.410
our point of view. It's evolved by
jettisoning words in a particular way so

00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:56.000
that these words refer to a sort of
sections of the set of meanings. So why is

00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:59.072
this happening? In fact in some versions
of the experiment we go down

00:13:59.072 --> 00:14:01.786
to a single word for all things.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.930
So clearly we need something else in this
experiment, we need some kind of pressure

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:13.310
to be expressive as well as learnable for
the language. I can't go into the details

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:18.700
because I don't have time but what we
essentially did was we added in a filter

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:24.020
on the output of each participant. So we
threw out items that were ambiguous before

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:27.410
we passed it on to the next participants
and none of the participants could be

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.130
aware that we were doing this
manipulation. We ran the whole experiment

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:39.060
again with this hidden step and we got
completely different results. So here's

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:44.680
again the initial and another initial
language again completely random and now

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:50.100
ten generations later it looks quite
different. What I've done here is I've

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.830
added in hyphens to make it easier for you
to see but the participants don't get to

00:14:54.010 --> 00:15:01.330
see these hyphens. What you see here is
that different parts of the signals

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:06.060
correspond to different parts of the
meanings. So for example this "n" prefix

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:13.340
means that black things, the "r" prefix
means red things, a "plo" suffix means

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.530
something that's bouncing and so on. This
is the compositionaility we were looking

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:24.060
for and it emerged out of this process of
cultural transmission. Structure seems

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.990
to emerge spontaneously from this process
of cultural evolution. Now there's a

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:34.690
couple of obvious worries that you might
have. Firstly perhaps the participants in

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:38.950
the experiment are kind of deliberately
thinking well this language is rubbish,

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:43.280
here's how we can fix it up, add some
structure. We don't think that's happening

00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:46.900
because bear in mind these two different
runs of the experiment got very different

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.290
languages out, the participants couldn't
know which condition they were in. Another

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:57.320
possible objection is okay, but they
already speak a language, all of our

00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:01.542
participants spoke English so it's not
surprising that they gradually

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:05.562
changed the system to be one that
looks more like a language.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.600
That's a valid worry so we've recreated
all of this experiment in computer

00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:16.960
simulation where we can know that our
computational participants don't have a

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:22.744
pre-existing language and we get the same
results. Okay, so that's my first example.

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:28.370
The second example we wanted to move away
from this starting point with these random

00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:31.261
strings because that seems a bit weird.
Where do they come from?

00:16:31.261 --> 00:16:34.897
Instead we start from potentially
a much more

00:16:34.897 --> 00:16:42.372
natural starting point, one of
gestural pantomime. And we wanted to see

00:16:42.372 --> 00:16:46.110
if we could evolve something that looked
like a structured sign

00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:50.027
language, miniature structured sign
language out of an initial state that was

00:16:50.027 --> 00:16:53.024
iconic pantomime. This is joint work with
Kenny Smith,

00:16:53.024 --> 00:16:55.213
Katja Bramifer and Erica Cartmill.

00:16:55.898 --> 00:17:02.760
Here's how the experiment works. In this
version of the experiment the meanings now

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:08.900
are videos of bouncing balls, so here's
one, that's the thing that had to be

00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:14.444
conveyed and the signals are manual
gestures made to a video camera.

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:23.710
Something like this. The initial language
in this experiment was improvised one off

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:28.004
pantomimes that we got people into the lab
and said okay can you give the pantomime

00:17:28.004 --> 00:17:31.472
that corresponds to this video.
Participants are trained

00:17:31.472 --> 00:17:35.709
on 12 out of the 16 videos but
asked to produce gestures

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:38.810
for all 16 and then the same
process of this sort of

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:45.430
diffusion chain, transmission chain was
applied. So we'd see how the gestures

00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:49.310
evolved over generations. I'll just show
you the full set of meanings, it's a

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:54.690
little alarming when you see it. So these
are all the different videos tiled

00:17:54.870 --> 00:18:00.000
together and what you ca see here is
there's different paths in which the ball

00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:05.040
moves along, so flat, sloping, in a "s"
shape or in a circle.

00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:09.250
There are different manors so the ball
might be bouncing or rolling or spinning

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:14.320
or giving this nightmarish jittering
motion. So that's the set of meanings they

00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:19.190
have to convey. This is what the initial
pantomimes look like for all the

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:25.720
participants we got in just to do one off
gesture for these. What you see here is

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:30.900
there's a huge range of different
strategies that people use to produce

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.701
these meanings, an enormous
diversity in strategies here.

00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:39.282
What we were interested in, some of them
more successfully than others,

00:18:41.333 --> 00:18:45.807
What we were interested in is how do
these strategies evolve down generations.

00:18:45.807 --> 00:18:48.868
So here's our first
participant who saw 12 of these

00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:52.453
and then produced a gesture
for each of them.

00:18:52.453 --> 00:18:58.280
IT looks more systematic, that's just
because it's one person so they're

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:00.730
looking more similar. In fact, there's
still a lot of diversity

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:04.747
here if you look at the hand
shape used to convey the

00:19:04.747 --> 00:19:07.550
ball and so on.
There's still a lot of diversity.

00:19:08.410 --> 00:19:14.157
Much later in the same chain we have this
participant. Now it's looking much more

00:19:14.157 --> 00:19:22.620
systematic. If you look at hand shape
for example it's now very similar across

00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:26.665
all the different videos. There's
particular kinds of systematicity

00:19:26.665 --> 00:19:29.080
we're interested in.
Here's an example from

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:33.447
another chain which I particularly like.
Have a look at what she's doing here

00:19:33.447 --> 00:19:38.743
to convey the ball moving?
So she signals the ball and then

00:19:38.743 --> 00:19:44.710
says the manner and then the path. So she
separated out two aspects of this meaning

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:49.730
compositionally into two different parts.
Indeed another interesting thing she does

00:19:49.910 --> 00:19:54.680
here is she self corrects. She says "oh
no, I got it wrong" watch again, she'll do

00:19:54.860 --> 00:20:00.200
it again. This indicates that at this
point in the evolution of the language

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:03.990
she's seeing that there's a right and
wrong answer, It's become grammatical.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:10.500
Just to summarize these and I'll be done.
Over time the gestures in this language

00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:15.900
become less pantomimic and more
conventional. We can actually measure

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.890
this, we can show that systematic
structure emerges over generations in this

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:25.900
experiment. Interestingly this separation
of manner and path mirrors what we can see

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:31.750
in real emerging sign languages. This is
work by Annie Singhouse and colleagues

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:35.880
looking at how Nicaraguan sign language,
an emerging sign language we get this

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:42.180
separation of manner and path emerging
over generations, over cohorts. So final

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:49.110
conclusions. I want to argue that language
is an evolutionary system in it's own

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:55.710
right and because of this languages adapt
and they adapt to pass more easily from

00:20:55.890 --> 00:21:01.890
learner to learner. The linguistic
structure is the solution that cultural

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:06.450
evolution finds the problem of being
learnable. So it's an inevitable

00:21:06.630 --> 00:21:10.460
consequence of the way language is
transmitted and we can and indeed we

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.310
should study this process in the
experiment lab, thank you very much.
