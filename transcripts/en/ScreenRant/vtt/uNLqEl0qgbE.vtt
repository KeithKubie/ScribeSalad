00:00:07.669 --> 00:00:11.519
Movies based on comic book superheroes have
never been bigger or better, but each new

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.410
film or franchise requires a supervillain
that is just as memorable.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.119
As the stakes and threats are rising every
year, and Marvel's shared universes continue

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.730
to unite heroes against a common enemy, the
villains will need to up their game just as

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.730
quickly.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.699
That may seem a tall order, but there's no
shortage of villains who could fit the bill.

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:33.730
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Most Powerful Villains
In The Marvel Universe.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.620
Ultron

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.559
The classic Marvel villain Ultron may have
been made famous on film, but the comic book

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:41.289
version is even more dangerous.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.929
Hank Pym originally created Ultron using his
own mind as a blueprint, giving the A.I. genius-level

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:51.089
intellect, and leading it to upgrade itself
multiple times before attacking the Avengers.

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.320
Constructing a new body out of the indestructible
metal Adamantium, Ultron's powers go well

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.879
beyond superstrength, flight, or speed.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.609
He's notoriously hard to kill, turning on
every other villain who decided to bring him

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.909
back to life.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.710
Add that fact that he can control technology
remotely, and even hypnotize humans to implant

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.210
secret missions, and Ultron's constantly evolving
intelligence can go toe-to-toe with the best

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.210
comic book villains, period.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.210
Vulcan

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.210
Every X-Men fan knows of the Summers brothers,
codenamed Cyclops and Havok, and both able

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.210
to launch powerful energy attacks.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.210
Scott, in the form of beams from his eyes,
and Alex, released in waves or along his arms.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.210
But it's the third Summers brother, Gabriel,
who can call himself the most powerful.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.210
Since he's basically able to control energy
in nearly every form, Gabriel can deflect

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:20.210
Cyclops' eyebeams, resist psychic attacks,
and even hijack or absorb the abilities of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.210
mutants around him.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.210
When he feels betrayed by professor X, he
takes the name Vulcan, and turns those powers

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.210
against his own family.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.210
Thankfully, he pursued his villainy in space,
not on Earth, becoming the head of an entire

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.210
alien empire.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.210
The Dark Phoenix

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.210
Back when Jean Grey was only the psychic 'Marvel
Girl,' the writers of the 'X-Men' series decided

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.210
to stun readers by making her the most powerful
mutant yet.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.171
Exposing Jean to lethal radiation, she emerged
as 'Phoenix,' a physical form of the cosmic

00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.280
and otherworldly 'Phoenix Force.'

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.640
Eventually, her heightened powers corrupted
her, driving Jean mad and wiping out alien

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.210
worlds by accident.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.409
Wielding telekinetic and psychic power beyond
any of her friends, Phoenix ended her own

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.659
life to prevent more death.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.469
Even though the publisher would later reveal
it wasn't really Jean, but a copy of her created

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:51.329
by the Phoenix Force, The Phoenix Saga remains
a fan-favorite.

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:49.470
The story was attempted on film by director
Brett Ratner, but it couldn't hold a candle

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:05.230
to 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.140
the comics.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.269
Galactus

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.780
Originally created to fight the Fantastic
Four, Galactus isnâ€™t an alien, or a god...

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.530
but a bit of both.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.079
Before the Big Bang created Marvel's universe,
an alien fled the death of the one that came

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.129
before, fusing with its essence before the
new one took its place.

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.360
Galactus was the result: a god-like embodiment
of the cosmos that most beings can't even

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.329
perceive, who has to feed on living planets
to stay alive.

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.230
His scout, the Silver Surfer may get most
of the recognition, but Galactus has the power

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.329
to do just about anything: transform matter,
teleport, create life, revive the dead...you

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:47.349
name it.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.310
Even the brilliant Reed Richards couldn't
tell just where Galactus' powers ended, but

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.590
exploiting his weak spots has saved Earth
more than a few times.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.590
Thanos

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.590
The alien known as the Mad Titan joined the
Avengers universe following their first team-up,

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.590
hinting that Earth's first encounter with
magical cosmic weapons was only the beginning.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:57.590
In the comics, ancient cosmic beings created
a race of Eternals to defend Earth, but when

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.590
Thanos (pronounced Thann-ose) was born, the
genes he shared with the Eternals' sworn enemies

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.590
were clear, and he was shunned.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.590
To prove his love to Mistress Death, Thanos
killed billions of innocents across space,

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:01.590
including his own people.

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.590
He may have been based on the DC Comics villain
Darkseid (pronounced "Dark Side"), but using

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.590
the Infinity Gauntlet to amplify his superhuman
strength, psychic powers, and universe-hopping

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.590
technology, Thanos has defeated Marvel's greatest
heroes too many times to count.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.590
The Beyonder

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.590
Plenty of Marvel villains can claim to be
the biggest threat a universe has to offer,

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:07.590
but few can actually state that they ARE a
universe.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.590
When The Beyonder was introduced as the main
antagonist of Marvel's "Secret Wars," it was

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.590
revealed that he was no mutant or alien, but
an entire universal realm known as 'The Beyond'

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.590
condensed into a human form.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.590
And his powers were as impressive as you'd
expect.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.950
Able to banish demons effortlessly, destroy,
resurrect, and reshape beings at will, The

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:13.950
Beyonder was even able to defeat Death itself.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.769
How did The Beyonder first use that power?

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.680
To throw heroes and villains into battle for
his amusement - proving that even if your

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.200
existence is an infinite one, a sense of humor
can't hurt.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.200
Annihilus

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.200
When an advanced race from Marvel's Negative
Zone seeded barren worlds with alien spores,

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.770
they couldn't have predicted that one spore
would grow into Annihilus.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.870
Evolving from a weak insect into a brilliant
warrior thanks to his creators' technology,

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.680
Annihilus set out to destroy any and all life
he saw as a threat.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.711
Over the years, that would come to include
the Avengers, Fantastic Four, and nearly every

00:04:36.711 --> 00:04:38.780
other Marvel superhero team.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.660
It's hard to know what's scarier: the Cosmic
Control Rod he wields, granting him superstrength

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:47.940
and immortality, or his Centurions - 200 superpowered
aliens plucked from the Negative Zone's many

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:48.940
planets.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.150
Oh, and he can't be killed without coming
back to life even angrier than before.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.030
Apocalypse

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.430
Five thousand years before mutants emerged
into the Marvel Universe, there was Apocalypse.

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.350
Born with grey skin and blue lips in ancient
Egypt, his tribe left him to die.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:09.910
Instead, he was discovered by a band of warriors
who recognized the boy as "En Sabah Nur" - the

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.130
first, immortal mutant.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.790
Over the years, Apocalypse would take a new
name, and reveal more mutant powers than nearly

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.150
another other Marvel character.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.120
Able to reshape his body, strength, speed,
and nearly everything else, there's no challenge

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.330
the villain can't change to defeat.

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.700
Eventually taking over Earth and mutant kind
to separate the weak from the strong, no mutant

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:32.470
could ever make the X-Men tremble like Apocalypse.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.230
Magus

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.692
Every Marvel fan knows the story of Adam Warlock,
a hero engineered to be the most perfect and

00:05:39.692 --> 00:05:42.100
highly-evolved human in existence.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:46.880
Not long after being created, Adam encountered
Magus, a leader of pure evil who led an oppressive

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.420
religious empire across thousands of enslaved
worlds.

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:51.870
With powers of "Quantum Magic" well beyond
Warlock, the real twist came when Magus revealed

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.380
that he was once Adam Warlock, eventually
corrupted and growing impossibly powerful.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.410
Warlock ended up using his Soul Gem (and some
teamwork) to bring Magus down, but his millennia-long

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:07.470
empire and limitless power make him one of
the greatest villains in Marvel's multiverse.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:08.470
Doctor Doom

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.470
Not every villain needs a superpower or alien
upbringing to be effective.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.470
Take Victor Von Doom: left with one parent
lost to a demon, and the other to a tyrant,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.470
Victor put his energy into righting those
wrongs.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.500
Mixing his mother's mysticism with old-fashioned
science, his brilliance soon landed him a

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.000
scholarship to America.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.060
But when an experiment left his face horribly
scarred, he put the blame on his friend and

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.520
colleague, Reed Richards of the Fantastic
Four.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.000
Taking over his home country of Latveria,
Doctor Doom would become one of Marvel's most

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.190
brilliant - and most villainous - figures,
even curing The Thing of his condition, when

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.190
Reed could never achieve it.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:29.190
The bad news: that was who sabotaged his experiment
in the first place.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:30.190
So what do you think of our list?

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.390
Did we miss any powerful villains in the marvel
universe?
