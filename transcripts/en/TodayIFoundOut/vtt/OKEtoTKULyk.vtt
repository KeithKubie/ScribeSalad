00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.920
When someone is “blowing smoke up your arse”
today, it is a figure of speech that means

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.660
that one person is complimenting another,
insincerely most of the time, in order to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.310
inflate the ego of the individual being flattered.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.140
Back in the late 1700s, however, doctors literally
blew smoke up people’s rectums.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.170
Believe it or not, it was a general mainstream
medical procedure used to, among many other

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.920
things, resuscitate people who were otherwise
presumed dead.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.140
In fact, it was such a commonly used resuscitation
method for drowning victims particularly,

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.550
that the equipment used in this procedure
was hung alongside certain major waterways,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.640
such as along the River Thames (equipment
courtesy of the Royal Humane Society).

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.399
People frequenting waterways were expected
to know the location of this equipment similar

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.080
to modern times concerning the location of
defibrillators.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.490
Smoke was blown up the rectum by inserting
a tube.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.659
This tube was connected to a fumigator and
a bellows which when compressed forced smoke

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.550
into the rectum.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.380
Sometimes a more direct route to the lungs
was taken by forcing the smoke into the nose

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.729
and mouth, but most physicians felt the rectal
method was more effective.

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.840
The nicotine in the tobacco was thought to
stimulate the heart to beat stronger and faster,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.159
thus encouraging respiration.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.500
The smoke was also thought to warm the victim
and dry out the person’s insides, removing

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.790
excessive moisture.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.270
Tobacco_smoke_enemaSo how did this all get
started?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.680
The Native Americans were known to have used
tobacco in a variety of ways, including treating

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.950
various medical ailments, and the European
doctors soon picked up on this and began advocating

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.049
it for treatments for everything from headaches
to cancer.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:04.869
In 1745, Richard Mead was among the first
known Westerners to suggest that administering

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.429
tobacco via an enema was an effective way
to resuscitate drowning victims.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.600
By 1774, Doctors William Hawes and Thom­as
Cogan, who practiced medicine in London, formed

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.120
The Institution for Affording Immediate Relief
to Persons Apparently Dead From Drowning.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.159
This group later became the Royal Hu­mane
Society.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:29.819
Back in the 18th century, the society promoted
the resuscitation of drowning people by paying

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:36.950
four guineas (about £450 today by purchasing
power, or $756) to anyone who was able to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.430
successfully revive a drowning victim.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.760
Volunteers within the society soon began using
the latest and greatest method of reviving

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.450
such half-drowned individuals, via tobacco
smoke enemas.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.420
Artificial respiration was used if the tobacco
enema did not successfully revive them.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.450
In order that people could easily remember
what to do in these cases, in 1774 Dr. Houlston

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.150
published a helpful little rhyme:

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.830
Tobacco glyster (enema), breathe and bleed.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.349
Keep warm and rub till you succeed.

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.060
And spare no pains for what you do;
May one day be repaid to you.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.040
The practice of using tobacco smoke enemas
on drowning victims quickly spread as a popular

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.160
way to introduce tobacco into the body to
treat an array of other medical conditions

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.810
including: headaches, hernias, respiratory
ailments and abdominal cramps, among many

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.299
other things.

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.269
Tobacco enemas were even used to treat typhoid
fever and during cholera outbreaks when patients

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.020
were in the final stages of the illnesses.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.640
In their most rudimentary form, tobacco smoke
enemas were not always administered with the

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.900
aide of bellows.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.500
Originally, the smoke was blown up the victim’s
rectum with whatever was handy, such as a

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:49.769
smoking pipe.

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.459
Of course, such close contact wasn’t ideal
and if the rescuer accidentally inhaled instead

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.180
of blew, let’s just say things that one
should not aspirate could be inhaled.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.890
If the person jerked around, mouth contact
was also a risk, even more risky considering

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.110
the person being administered too was sometimes
diseased.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.969
In fact, one of the earliest documented references
of using such a tobacco enema to resuscitate

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:18.530
someone came from someone using a smoking
pipe in 1746.

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.110
In this case, the man’s wife had nearly
drowned and was unconscious.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.840
It was suggested that an emergency tobacco
enema might revive her, at which point the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.780
husband of the woman took a pipe filled with
burning tobacco, shoved the stem into his

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.930
wife’s rectum and then covered the other
end of the pipe with his mouth and blew.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.890
As one would imagine, hot embers of tobacco
being blown up her rectum had the intended

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:44.720
effect and she was, indeed, revived.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.419
This practice quickly spread, reaching its
peak in the early 19th century before, in

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.650
1811, English scientist Ben Brodie via animal
testing discovered that nicotine was toxic

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:55.900
to the cardiac system.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:01.090
Over the next several decades, the popularity
of literally “blowing smoke up someone’s

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.759
arse” gradually became a thing of the past.

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:22.960
Figuratively, though, this practice is still
alive and well.
