00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.952
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:07.872 --> 00:00:10.670
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.920
SPEAKER 1: Thank you so much
for the kind intro, Dave.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.510
I'm not the man of
the hour, though.

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:15.890
These two are.

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:18.650
We have the founder of
Ripple, Chris Larsen,

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.680
and we have its current
CTO, Stefan Thomas.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.290
We're very, very
excited to have them.

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.310
This is going to
be an awesome talk.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.140
A little brief intro--

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.040
Chris got his MBA from Stanford.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.570
He started E-Loan, which
is a mortgage lender.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.130
It was actually
the first platform

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.120
to really give out FICO
credit scores to its users.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.690
He started Prosper, which
is actually the first P2P--

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.500
peer-to-peer-- lending
marketplace in the US.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.840
And famously, he co-founded
Ripple Labs, which

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.980
is the subject of today's talk.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.830
So we're really excited
to have Chris here.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.120
Stefan Thomas is the
CTO of Ripple Labs.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.020
He was the CTO of numerous tech
companies like E-loan and Tech

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.900
Spare.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.060
He founded WeUseCoins, which
created this Bitcoin primer

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.000
video which amassed
8 million views

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.770
and was a primer
for a lot of people

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.350
to just learn about
the basics of Bitcoin,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.700
and it blew up on the web.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.710
So I'd check that out.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.470
And he's on the board of
directors at the JS Foundation,

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.210
and he's the current
CTO of Ripple.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.600
Ripple describes itself
as the only enterprise

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.840
solution for blockchain.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.380
It allows institutions
to send money globally

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.190
in a fast, frictionless,
and cheaper way.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.770
And its broader eventual aim is
to create an internet of value,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.110
which I'm really excited to talk
to both of these guys about.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380
So without further
ado, please give

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.730
a hand for Chris and Stefan.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.460
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.620
Awesome, guys.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.050
So can you guys just give us a
brief bio, in your own words--

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.530
your career and how you
came to found Ripple Labs,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.460
and then get involved?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.710
CHRIS LARSEN: Great, happy to.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.750
And first of all, thanks for
having us, and thanks for not

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.920
making a Bart Simpson joke.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.586
Appreciate that.

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:13.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.940
So yeah, as you
mentioned, we've been

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.490
in FinTech for
about 20 years now

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:20.880
with two start-ups previously.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.590
E-loan and Prosper, kind
of the common thread there.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.787
Those were focused
on the consumer.

00:02:25.787 --> 00:02:27.620
Ripple, obviously, is
focused on enterprise,

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.560
and there's some
learnings that I had from

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.302
that I'll share later.

00:02:31.302 --> 00:02:33.010
But the idea there
was using the internet

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.350
to democratize finance.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.880
I think we did a
lot of good there,

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.720
but we were always limited
by just a fundamental lack

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.140
of infrastructure in FinTech.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.480
So in my view, FinTech
really hasn't even started.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.040
It has been a stepchild
of the internet boom,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.910
because FinTech really has to
involve both data and money.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.820
And so far, you've only had
the ability to move data.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.770
So both a lot of excitement,
a lot of frustration

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.780
that we couldn't go further.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.970
At the same time, it was
always keeping an eye

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.790
on what was going on
with virtual currencies.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.452
And Bitcoin, obviously,
was a real breakthrough,

00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:15.660
but there have been a lot
of attempts over the years.

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.550
And so we were watching
things like Linden dollars,

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.650
which was currency that existed
in the early days of Second

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.430
Life.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.050
Phil Rosedale-- an amazing guy.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.930
Still the coolest
guy in crypto, right?

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.520
Things like Vermont Dollars--

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.430
this idea of local currencies
in a very small community,

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.380
super interesting.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.090
Obviously, Beenz
and Flooz, which

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.700
were two big,
well-funded projects

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.690
during the first dotcom boom
that failed spectacularly.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.300
But it just seemed like
it was a matter of time

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.040
before you have a global
digital asset with no government

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.250
backing and no counterparty.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.710
As far as Ripple itself,
we should actually go back

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:58.870
to about '04.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.510
There was something called The
Ripple Project created by Ryan

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.200
Fugger, a Canadian gentleman.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.710
He was just really a neat
guy, and he tried, really,

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:15.430
to give birth to this idea
of a peer-to-peer platform

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.227
for people exchanging
their own credit--

00:04:19.227 --> 00:04:20.560
essentially, their own currency.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.690
Every person would have
their own currency.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.620
Super interesting concept
that was a big part of what

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.330
influenced us.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.720
Fast forward to 2011, and
there was these three geniuses

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.130
that got together--

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.032
Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb,
and David Schwartz.

00:04:37.032 --> 00:04:38.740
And this is, of course,
after Bitcoin was

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.031
created a couple years earlier.

00:04:40.031 --> 00:04:42.350
They were fascinated
by what Bitcoin did,

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:45.520
but they were frustrated by
the enormous waste of energy

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.350
that is at the heart of mining.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.990
That's the core part of Bitcoin.

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.350
So they set out to build a more
efficient consensus algorithm,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.990
and they came up with
something really beautiful.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.090
They also were inspired
by what Ryan Fugger had

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.880
done at The Ripple
Project, and also

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.270
brought in that idea of
pathfinding algorithm

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.630
so that anything of value
can be exchanged along

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.740
with that digital
asset to really--

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.054
I think that was the birth
point of this internet of value.

00:05:13.054 --> 00:05:14.720
STEFAN THOMAS: The
Interledger Protocol,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.020
which we'll show
in a little bit,

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.360
actually is almost like
an overlay protocol

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.160
over blockchains, but then also
traditional financial systems.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.450
And that allows you to
innovate in different parts

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.980
of the network
independently instead

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.070
of having this central
governance model where everyone

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.405
has to agree to any rule
changes that are happening.

00:05:32.405 --> 00:05:34.780
CHRIS LARSEN: Yeah, and I
think this is a critical point.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:38.410
I think we came to a realization
that a blockchain was not

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:41.650
going to be the solution to
the biggest problem we think

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.650
the world has right now in
this whole FinTech area,

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.140
which is-- there is
no internet of value.

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:49.960
And a lot of people talk about--

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.420
Bitcoin's going to be a
new protocol for money.

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.940
Well, it's really
a database, right?

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.660
So a single database or a single
network cannot be the network

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.800
of networks.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:02.500
And so that was the big flaw,
and that's what led to, I

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.580
think, Stefan having this
ah-ha moment of the need

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.610
for something like ILP, which
was a dangerous moment for--

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:12.193
STEFAN THOMAS: It was scary at
first, because we were trying--

00:06:12.193 --> 00:06:14.590
we were out there promoting
this asset like XRP.

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.020
Telling everyone, hey, you
should put all your balances

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.650
on this ledger.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.108
You should do all
your transactions

00:06:19.108 --> 00:06:21.040
through this one system.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.630
And we knew the
friction from that,

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.300
but then again, stepping back
from that and suddenly saying,

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.210
oh, there are going
to be many systems?

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.040
Was very scary.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.730
And so we actually
waited almost a year

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.790
to publish the white paper
until we had, in our minds,

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:36.900
a result-- a strategy
around, what's

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.460
XRP's role in this new
world, and how do we

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:41.890
make sure that our
technologies are

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:45.970
still needed and still necessary
and can benefit this new world?

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.470
How do we re-architect
everything

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.370
to serve this new world?

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:51.760
So I think we're still in
the process of rolling out

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.510
all of the different pieces.

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:55.810
But it was that 1 year
period from, I would,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:07:01.180
say mid-2014 when we first
had that realization,

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.090
to October 2015 when the white
paper for Interledger came

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.630
out--

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.730
where we tried to put
all the pieces in place

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.510
for [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:08.770
CHRIS LARSEN: Because
remember, Ripple always

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.300
was different from Bitcoin
in that you can put

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.680
anything of value in it, right?

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.870
So this idea of--

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.500
we call it IOUs or balances,
but really being value agnostic,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.680
and that then being the
engine for the exchange

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.690
of that thing of value.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:25.630
But having the combination
of ILP with XRP--

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.905
we think that's
the killer formula.

00:07:28.905 --> 00:07:31.030
STEFAN THOMAS: Now you can
have any type of value--

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:33.325
any currency-- but also
any type of ledger.

00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:35.350
So anything from a
centralized ledger

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.820
to a blockchain, et cetera.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:37.600
CHRIS LARSEN: And
if you look at--

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.970
stepping way back, the
macro problem that we think,

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:43.300
again, the world has is lack
of an internet of value.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.000
You argue that this gets
to the heart of the problem

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.520
with globalization, which is
obviously under a lot of stress

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.130
today, right?

00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:51.060
It's not working
for a lot of people.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:54.409
And we don't think of it as,
well, globalization's bad.

00:07:54.409 --> 00:07:56.200
We think of it as,
globalization's actually

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.910
incomplete.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.410
Until you have an
internet of value,

00:07:58.410 --> 00:08:00.340
you really can't have
true globalization.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.636
You need these three core
interoperability technologies

00:08:03.636 --> 00:08:04.510
working all together.

00:08:04.510 --> 00:08:08.300
You need interoperability of
data, of goods, and money,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:08.800
right?

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.390
So the world today, of course,
has interoperability of data.

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.890
It's completely transformed the
world over the last 20 years.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:19.180
It has interoperability and
goods through a simple thing

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:21.010
called the shipping container--

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:23.710
which, before that was
invented, shipping stuff

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.139
was incredibly inefficient
and labor-intensive.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:27.430
Stuff would arrive at one port.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:29.940
It to be ripped
apart and reshipped.

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:32.891
With a shipping container,
your ship to train to truck--

00:08:32.891 --> 00:08:34.890
any port in the world,
you have interoperability

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:37.179
of goods since the 1950s.

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:39.429
That's sort of what
internet of value is.

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.620
It's like the shipping
container for value.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:43.530
And again, that can't
be a blockchain.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.780
A blockchain is like a single
shipping company that will--

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.430
you'll max out that
shipping company

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:51.052
and you'll have a dependency
on that one shipping company.

00:08:51.052 --> 00:08:53.260
A shipping container, you
can create endless shipping

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:53.870
containers.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:57.100
It has no effect on any other
shipping containers deployed.

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:58.360
That's sort of what ILP--

00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.540
almost the ultimate
decentralization.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:02.500
So that's kind of how
we're thinking about it.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:03.880
STEFAN THOMAS: For the technical
people in the audience,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.020
it's a stateless protocol.

00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.600
So you can literally just run
it over different systems.

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.425
So doesn't keep any
balances, et cetera.

00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:11.800
CHRIS LARSEN: And then we
think really good things happen

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:17.500
when the world finally has a
full globalization platform,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.640
but this has to happen.

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.577
And again, what is
this meaning now

00:09:20.577 --> 00:09:21.910
that we don't have it right now?

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:25.120
It means-- we all
know $750 to Europe

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.790
is kind of impossible, right?

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:30.070
We know the example--

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.240
the Airbnb host in
Tanzania who should

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.587
be making $29 on a rental,
and by the end of the day, $9

00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:39.170
is showing up.

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.700
This is an actual
example, right?

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.960
So that's a problem with
relatively big amounts

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.660
of value.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.892
Think about the 2 billion
people in the developing world.

00:09:47.892 --> 00:09:50.350
The Gates Foundation would say
they need to be able to send

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:55.150
$0.50 to be real participants
in the global economy.

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.470
Take that even further.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.930
If you think about all
the connected devices

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.930
and applications
that probably should

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.700
be, in power, the
same value, that

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:07.836
might need to be a
thousandth of a penny.

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:09.460
That's just not
possible until you have

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.570
this internet value in place.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:12.310
So the world is being
held back by this,

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:15.580
and we think that's the true
breakthrough that this whole--

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:17.530
whatever you want to
call this industry--

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.700
really is all about.

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.030
SPEAKER 1: There are
some detractors of Ripple

00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:26.050
that say it's this centralized
blockchain, or the enterprise

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.980
blockchain.

00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.530
A lot of Bitcoin loyalists,
and Bitcoin in general,

00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.560
might have come out of an
anarchist or cypherpunk

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:36.320
movement early--

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.170
--on as part of that.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.025
And so that's the
general criticism.

00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:45.620
So I wanted to give you guys
a chance to respond to that,

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:46.840
and then I'll combine
the second question,

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.798
because Stefan has an
awesome presentation he's

00:10:48.798 --> 00:10:49.390
going to give.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:51.940
The second question
is, we are living

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:55.630
in a crazy environment in
terms of cryptocurrency-- just

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:02.530
speculation on the price
of tokens and blockchains.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.420
Do you guys think we're
in 1999 right now?

00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:08.582
Is this a dotcom bubble
that we're experiencing?

00:11:08.582 --> 00:11:09.790
So yeah, those two questions.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:10.850
STEFAN THOMAS: OK, so
I'll take the first one.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.200
You can--

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.485
CHRIS LARSEN: Sure.

00:11:11.485 --> 00:11:13.150
STEFAN THOMAS:
--talk about dotcom.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.940
So first of all, the enterprise
part I take as a compliment.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.190
I think that's precisely
what we're trying to do,

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:20.273
is we're trying to build
the first blockchain that

00:11:20.273 --> 00:11:23.920
can actually be used
for real use cases.

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:26.969
When you think of any
distributed system, when

00:11:26.969 --> 00:11:28.510
you take a distributed
systems class,

00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:29.440
the first thing
your professor will

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.981
tell you is your
distributed system's

00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.370
still only going to be as
good as the nodes it runs on.

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:34.953
And so if you think
of bitcoin miners,

00:11:34.953 --> 00:11:37.570
they're only incentivized to
basically hash as efficiently

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.230
as possible.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.600
They're not incentivized to
provide physical security

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.040
for the data centers.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.110
They're not incentivized
to make decisions

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:45.850
in the interest of the network.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:47.650
So they have a
very pure incentive

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.460
to just hash as
much as possible,

00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:52.310
get paid, rinse and repeat.

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.440
In the case of Ripple,
since the validators

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.350
are chosen by the users, if
a validator, for example,

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.930
votes against a block
size increase or something

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:03.260
like that if there were
an issue in Ripple, then

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.462
you would eventually find
that users would no longer add

00:12:06.462 --> 00:12:07.670
that validator to their list.

00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:10.250
And so that validator would
slowly lose influence.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.220
And so it's not as
much of a system that's

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.080
tailored to users
like Bitcoin is,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.720
where anyone can just
run a node and it just

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.360
auto-configures itself,
connects to the network.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.580
You do have to do that
validator selection manually.

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.900
You have to think about--

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.360
politically speaking--
which validators

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:28.920
do you want to empower
with your node, et cetera?

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.520
So it is more
targeted at actively

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.262
being managed by companies,
things of that nature.

00:12:34.262 --> 00:12:36.470
But I think the reason that
that makes a lot of sense

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.210
is because when you
actually go out there

00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:41.130
into the market,
the evil people--

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:42.600
you mentioned I'm an anarchist.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:46.200
So I really want to
empower people, right?

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.600
But the people that you've got
to fight are not all the banks.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.330
There are a few very,
very powerful players

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.729
in the market that take
a little bit off the top,

00:12:55.729 --> 00:12:57.770
and those are the people
that you want to bypass.

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:58.770
And then everyone else--

00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:00.812
there's a lot of small
banks and regional banks

00:13:00.812 --> 00:13:02.270
and so on that
we've talked to that

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.230
are really trying to provide
better user experience.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.800
They're really trying to
provide lower fees, et cetera.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.950
Those are the companies that we
want to work with and empower,

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:10.949
and it's not just banks.

00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:14.430
It's payment providers, mobile
money providers, and so on.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.324
So that's where that
different approach comes from.

00:13:17.324 --> 00:13:18.740
And on the
centralization point, I

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.031
would say that there are a
lot of different definitions

00:13:21.031 --> 00:13:23.340
of centralization,
and we're going down

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:26.750
the list of meeting more and
more of them as we progress.

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.330
One of the ones that
we don't meet yet

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.440
is that we still run a majority
of the trusted validators.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.090
But that's something
that we're--

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:38.530
this year-- going to start
rolling out in terms of,

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:41.270
we have already got a lot of
third-party validators running.

00:13:41.270 --> 00:13:44.010
So people are going to start
trusting them this year.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.340
And so that's just one more
step to go in that direction.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:50.720
And I think if I compare it to
where we were with Bitcoin--

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:53.300
with Bitcoin, we had some
level of decentralization.

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.704
Again, meeting some of the
definitions but not all.

00:13:55.704 --> 00:13:57.620
For instance, there's
no geographic diversity.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.497
It's very concentrated
in China right now.

00:14:00.497 --> 00:14:02.830
But we didn't have a very
good roadmap in order to-- how

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:06.530
to overcome that, because
the system is really--

00:14:06.530 --> 00:14:11.180
it's just centers are set up
in a, I would now say, bad way.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.920
Whereas with Ripple, the
incentives are in order.

00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:16.490
And so it's just a matter
of validators having

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.070
the right amount of
operational histories

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:20.750
so people actually
start trusting them,

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:22.708
and us having enough
confidence in the software

00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:25.831
to actually continuously let go
of more and more of the reigns

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:26.330
here.

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.440
So I think, for Ripple,
it's a clearer roadmap

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.080
to get to a very high
level of decentralization.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.440
CHRIS LARSEN: And bottom
line in decentralization

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.780
is-- there's a bright line.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:41.676
If Ripple did not
exist, would the network

00:14:41.676 --> 00:14:42.550
continue to function?

00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:43.310
Yes.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:47.040
So that's that hard line
of which side you're on.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:49.520
And then, I think, it's
Stefan's point-- a variety

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.410
of gradations from there.

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.020
And then second, I think, on
what's going on in the market

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.960
today--

00:14:54.960 --> 00:15:00.080
so obviously, a really
interesting time in this space.

00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.230
Clearly, there is a lot
of speculative interest

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:07.650
that's going on, and I
break that into two parts.

00:15:07.650 --> 00:15:11.420
One is there's
clearly a lot of--

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.560
almost crypto day
trading going on.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.830
It's almost like the days
of the early internet

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.367
with all the day trading.

00:15:17.367 --> 00:15:18.950
And I think, probably
if you look back

00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:23.020
on most people that were
day trading back in 2000,

00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:25.575
I bet it didn't work
out that well for people

00:15:25.575 --> 00:15:26.450
that were doing that.

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.570
People shouldn't do that.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:31.310
You could lose everything.

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:32.780
It's just not a good plan.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.970
People should not be putting
their retirement money

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:38.200
to work day trading
cryptocurrencies.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.920
And I think there's
a lot of skepticism

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.627
that you see out there.

00:15:42.627 --> 00:15:44.960
Nathaniel Popper, for example,
of "The New York Times"--

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.879
he writes about
that skeptically,

00:15:47.879 --> 00:15:49.170
and he's right to be skeptical.

00:15:49.170 --> 00:15:52.150
So people should be
very careful with that.

00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:53.900
But a second part of
speculation, I think,

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:56.600
is being, now, increasingly
driven by institutions.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.810
So institutions' funds-- we
would call it the Wall Street

00:15:59.810 --> 00:16:00.920
tidal wave--

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.955
is coming into play here.

00:16:03.955 --> 00:16:05.330
And I think what's
going on there

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.090
is that very sophisticated
people are saying--

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:10.070
investors are
saying-- look, there's

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.210
some meaningful percentage.

00:16:11.210 --> 00:16:13.450
That this is, in fact,
a second internet.

00:16:13.450 --> 00:16:17.630
And this internet of value
can be as transformational.

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.195
That's a longer-term call
that that's going to happen.

00:16:21.195 --> 00:16:24.100
So I'd say that's more
constructive speculation.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:27.920
And I think those institutions
and those professionals,

00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:32.150
they've seen what's happened in
this last 20 years of the net--

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:38.330
the great promise, the
over-hype, the total bubble,

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:39.230
the crash.

00:16:39.230 --> 00:16:42.560
And then fast forward 20
years where we are today.

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:44.450
If you look back,
you'd probably say,

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.760
probably the early promise--

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:48.410
it was probably
under-hyped given

00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.090
the impact that all of this
has had on human existence.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.640
So that's a more
constructive view.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.370
The use cases for industries,
enterprise, payment providers,

00:17:00.370 --> 00:17:01.540
and other things--

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.880
that is coming on board.

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.579
So I suspect that ratio of--

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:10.409
hopefully the long-term
speculative activity

00:17:10.409 --> 00:17:11.950
and the use cases
starts to look more

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:13.810
like what you see
in normal markets,

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:14.829
because those things
can actually work

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.300
pretty constructively together.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.450
One last point on that
I think interesting is--

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:23.050
in the first internet, that
started with institutions--

00:17:23.050 --> 00:17:24.640
VCs and then Wall Street--

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:27.869
and then went on to this day
trader dynamic that you saw.

00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.785
This is kind of the
reverse of that, actually.

00:17:29.785 --> 00:17:33.329
It started with individuals,
and now the institutional wave

00:17:33.329 --> 00:17:34.120
is coming on board.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.910
So that's a little
bit different flavor.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.410
But definitely, I
think, the world's

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:39.951
never seen anything
like this before.

00:17:39.951 --> 00:17:42.377
So it's trying to grapple,
what are the metrics?

00:17:42.377 --> 00:17:43.460
Do you compare it to Visa?

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:45.250
Do you compare it to gold?

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.710
Is it the first protocol
that can be monetized?

00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:49.039
Lots of new questions.

00:17:49.039 --> 00:17:50.080
SPEAKER 1: Awesome, guys.

00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.010
Really appreciate it.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.860
Stefan's now going to give
an awesome presentation

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.440
about what's in store on the
technical side for Ripple,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.490
and then Chris is
going to stay here.

00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:59.320
Stefan's going to
come back, and we're

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.111
going to do a little
Q&amp;A with the audience.

00:18:01.111 --> 00:18:04.060
So take it away.

00:18:04.060 --> 00:18:07.210
STEFAN THOMAS: So what this is
trying to illustrate is if you

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.800
deploy Interledger
on some network--

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.760
and we envision that there will
probably be a global instance

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:16.150
of it, just like the internet
has a global instance--

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:18.490
then you have these
different nodes--

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.290
these little blue nodes here.

00:18:20.290 --> 00:18:23.230
And we call them connectors,
but they're basically

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:24.510
like routers and IPs.

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.169
So they basically take
in packets on one side.

00:18:27.169 --> 00:18:28.960
They look at the
destination on the packet.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.910
They compare it to
their routing table,

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.590
and then they
forward that packet

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.150
towards that destination.

00:18:34.150 --> 00:18:37.060
Whenever you look at any kind
of blockchain presentation,

00:18:37.060 --> 00:18:39.010
there's a pretty
good chance you'll

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:42.700
see some kind of graphic
that has nodes connected

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.030
by lines, some kind of graph.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:50.660
And you'll hear things like,
Bitcoin is the TCP/IP of money.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:54.340
And when we hear that, we cringe
a little bit, because if you

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:58.060
know anything about how TCP/IP
works and how Bitcoin works,

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:00.010
they are very
different protocols.

00:19:00.010 --> 00:19:03.142
They're two very different
things in a very different way.

00:19:03.142 --> 00:19:04.600
And so the challenge
that we always

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.520
have when we talk
about Interledger is it

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:08.830
is actually a lot like TCP/IP.

00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:10.690
And through this
little presentation,

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:14.050
I want to try to convince
you as to why I say that.

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:17.576
But people already have
usually seen some kind

00:19:17.576 --> 00:19:18.700
of blockchain presentation.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:20.860
It already looks
a lot like this,

00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:23.530
but is a little bit
more superficial

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:25.840
in terms of the similarities.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.540
And so if I want to send a
packet into this network,

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.870
I just send it to whichever
connect I'm connected to,

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:34.960
and it should find its
way to whatever receiver

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.350
I've put on it.

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.970
So in that way, it's
a lot like TCP/IP.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:41.620
Now, you might say, OK, so
you're routing these packets,

00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:44.830
but how does actual
money really move?

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.550
So the way that that works
is that once you have a path

00:19:48.550 --> 00:19:50.410
and you're sending
these packets,

00:19:50.410 --> 00:19:53.470
each link is responsible
for its own settlement.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:57.370
So what we tend to do is if
you have two connectors that

00:19:57.370 --> 00:20:01.030
have a peering relationship
with each other,

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:02.860
they're going to
have this packet

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.334
traffic going back and forth.

00:20:04.334 --> 00:20:06.250
And so they're going to
look at those packets,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:08.590
and then they're going
to eventually settle.

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.439
And for the core
of the network, it

00:20:10.439 --> 00:20:12.730
makes the most sense to settle
through a digital asset.

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:14.440
And the reason for
that is that they

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:18.350
are very easy to move
internationally across borders.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:21.580
You have very low costs in
terms of when you move them.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.080
And since you're
going to have a lot

00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.840
of inbound and
outbound traffic, it

00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:27.010
makes sense to just stay
in that digital asset

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:29.260
to do all of your settlements.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:32.050
But of course, the
majority of people-- users

00:20:32.050 --> 00:20:34.810
out there-- don't actually have
easy access to digital assets

00:20:34.810 --> 00:20:35.740
yet.

00:20:35.740 --> 00:20:39.070
And so you do need
some form of support

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:41.171
for traditional payment systems.

00:20:41.171 --> 00:20:43.420
And the interesting thing
is that all these settlement

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:47.950
networks really do is move
payments across, or move money.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:50.840
And so that's something
that is supported by all

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.092
the legacy payment networks.

00:20:52.092 --> 00:20:53.800
So what we can actually
do is we can just

00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.690
aggregate to a greater degree.

00:20:55.690 --> 00:20:58.450
So we wait a little bit
longer before we settle,

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:00.520
and then we send one
big payment across.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:02.020
So you see that
at the beginning,

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.310
here with the sender--

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.250
down there-- and the
receiver in the upper-right--

00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.950
where those settlements
are happening a little less

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.810
frequently, and they're
a little bit bigger.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:12.380
And they're probably a
little bit more expensive,

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.754
but they can settle
lots and lots

00:21:13.754 --> 00:21:15.730
of these individual packets.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.230
And so with this
architecture, what

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.110
that means is that from
an end-to-end perspective,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.350
we can send a packet at
incredibly low latency.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:27.220
We can send it at an incredibly
low incremental cost.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.720
And so that's
really what makes it

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.950
feel a lot like the internet.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.860
You can really just connect
to lots of different services

00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.360
and pay for lots
of different things

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:37.022
without accumulating a lot
of fees while doing that.

00:21:37.022 --> 00:21:38.980
And then, sure there's
a settlement eventually,

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:42.130
and hopefully these
last mile settlements

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:45.220
will get more efficient-- just
like internet connectivity went

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.270
from 56K modems all the
way up to what we have now

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.860
where I have Google Fiber.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:52.060
So I'm very happy with that.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:22:00.370
So yeah, here's a little chart
of the actual architecture.

00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:03.244
And again, if you're
familiar with TCP/IP,

00:22:03.244 --> 00:22:04.660
they draw the same
kind of picture

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:07.917
with the four layers,
which is sometimes called

00:22:07.917 --> 00:22:09.000
the internet architecture.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.799
It's a little bit less detailed
than the OSI architecture,

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:13.090
but I won't bore you with that.

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.360
It's just a reference for
the people that know that.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.410
So the four layers actually
work very similarly

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.360
to the four layers in TCP/IP.

00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:24.640
So I just want to go
through those four

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.650
to give you a sense of how
this all works together.

00:22:27.650 --> 00:22:29.890
The way you should think
about the Interledger layer

00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:32.050
is-- that's essentially
an abstraction layer.

00:22:32.050 --> 00:22:34.030
So that's basically
the thing that you

00:22:34.030 --> 00:22:36.670
have all the different ways
of moving money below it,

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.295
and then you have
all the different use

00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:40.570
cases for moving money
above it, and it brings them

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.420
all together.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.720
So in the case of the
internet, it would be--

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.840
the internet layer has
all the different ways

00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.180
of moving information below
it and all the different use

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.031
cases building on top
of it, and so now you

00:22:51.031 --> 00:22:52.780
can have all these
different combinations.

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.500
I can make a Skype
call over my WiFi.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.800
I can send an email over
my satellite internet.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:23:00.490
So it really doesn't matter
what use case I'm using

00:23:00.490 --> 00:23:01.719
and which network I'm on.

00:23:01.719 --> 00:23:03.260
I can combine them
in different ways.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:07.160
And so this is doing the
same thing for money.

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.430
OK, now an application layer--

00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:12.300
this would be the
equivalent of HTTP, SMTP.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.630
This is use case-specific.

00:23:13.630 --> 00:23:15.820
You would make different
application layer protocols

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:17.780
for different use cases.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:19.900
So one that we've
designed so far

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.040
is called SPSP, or Simple
Payment Setup Protocol.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:27.250
And basically, all that does
is it defines what a internet

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:28.240
identifier looks like.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.850
So think of that like
an email address.

00:23:30.850 --> 00:23:33.520
And you could send to
that type of identifier

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.280
if you wanted to pay somebody
as on a peer-to-peer basis,

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.260
or you could build
that into simple apps.

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.050
It's not super efficient,
so it's like HTTP--

00:23:41.050 --> 00:23:44.650
general purpose
application layer protocol.

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.480
You could make a much
more specialized one.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.670
So for instance, we
did an experiment

00:23:48.670 --> 00:23:51.730
where we built payments
into WebTorrent.

00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:55.600
So basically, to pay the
uploaders, but also the content

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.522
creators, which I is a
really cool aspect of this.

00:23:58.522 --> 00:23:59.980
It's sufficient
enough that you can

00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:03.430
pay a lot of different parties
in the flow of whatever app

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:04.990
or interaction that
you're a part of,

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:07.360
and we'll see a demo
of that in a bit.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.840
But I think this is where
I expect a lot of variety,

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.500
is on the application layer.

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:14.250
Now we'll talk about
that transport layer.

00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:15.880
So if you're
familiar with TCP/IP,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.500
this is where you find your TCP.

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.620
And TCP is really common to a
lot of different application

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:22.690
layer protocols
that build on it,

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.960
and it gives you some
basic services, right?

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.330
It gives you sequencing of
packets so that your data comes

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:29.800
out the right order.

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.970
It gives you retransmission.

00:24:30.970 --> 00:24:34.070
If a packet gets lost, it'll
send it again, and so on.

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:37.539
And we have a transport
layer protocol called PSK2,

00:24:37.539 --> 00:24:39.080
and it does a lot
of the same things.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.732
It's responsible
for doing things

00:24:40.732 --> 00:24:42.190
like-- if you send
a large payment,

00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:43.720
it'll split it
into smaller chunks

00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.010
and then reassemble them.

00:24:45.010 --> 00:24:46.900
It'll do things
like retransmission

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:48.980
of payment packets, et cetera.

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.940
So again, I'm trying
to really get across--

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:53.740
we're copping from
the internet a lot.

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.049
And we have to give
them a lot of credit,

00:24:56.049 --> 00:24:58.090
because a lot of the things
that they do actually

00:24:58.090 --> 00:25:00.730
apply to money very well.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:03.580
Now, the Interledger layer
is an interesting one,

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.619
because that's where
all the routing happens.

00:25:05.619 --> 00:25:06.910
And when we first started out--

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.250
I'll tell you one
anecdote about the design

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:10.679
of this layer, which is--

00:25:10.679 --> 00:25:12.220
when we first started
out, we assumed

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:13.330
that the routing
would have to be

00:25:13.330 --> 00:25:15.871
quite different, because we're
talking about money after all.

00:25:15.871 --> 00:25:18.040
We're not talking
about information.

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:22.330
And so we knew about BGP
and how it works and so on,

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.830
but we thought a lot of those
things wouldn't be applicable.

00:25:24.830 --> 00:25:27.447
We wanted to route by
the lowest cost path.

00:25:27.447 --> 00:25:29.530
We thought that that was
the most important thing,

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.630
was to minimize the fees.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:33.220
But as we actually
building it, we

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.330
realized that if you optimize
by fees, what can happen

00:25:37.330 --> 00:25:40.270
is somebody in the network
just advertises a absurd rate.

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:43.840
So they just advertise, hey, I
can exchange $1 for 600 euros.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.280
Now, that's suddenly
the best path

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:47.940
to take for absolutely every
payment in the entire network.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:49.070
Now, what do you think
is going to happen?

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:50.710
So that node's going to go down.

00:25:50.710 --> 00:25:53.200
Obviously, that rate was
never real to begin with.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.060
And so the whole thing
just breaks down.

00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.350
And so one of the reasons for
the way that BGP is designed

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:01.450
is to make the
length of the path

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.980
one of the primary metrics.

00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.290
And what that does is
if someone advertises

00:26:05.290 --> 00:26:07.734
some ridiculous metrics,
you're still only going

00:26:07.734 --> 00:26:09.400
to take down his
immediate neighborhood,

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.720
because for everyone
else, it's still going

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:12.180
to look like a big detour--

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.770
a very long path that
they don't want to take.

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:17.890
And so it turns out
that even for money,

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.260
the length of the path is
just a very good proxy for all

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.670
the other things you
might be interested in,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:22.750
like how reliable is it?

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:23.620
What's the latency?

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.770
What's the fees?

00:26:24.770 --> 00:26:27.790
Those are all lower, or tend
to be lower, for shorter paths.

00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:29.380
And so we can do
exactly what BGP

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.660
does in terms of
routing by shortest path

00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:35.130
first, and then using
other metrics to tiebreak

00:26:35.130 --> 00:26:38.560
if paths are the same
length, picking the best one.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.680
And we just basically add
fees and other metric,

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:43.035
just like the
internet has latency.

00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:45.160
I already talked a little
bit about the settlement.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.990
The key thing to
mention here is that all

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:48.365
we need from the
settlement layer

00:26:48.365 --> 00:26:49.670
is that it can transmit money.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.070
It doesn't have to be very fast.

00:26:51.070 --> 00:26:52.760
It doesn't have
to be very cheap.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:54.905
If it's slower, we
just settle less often.

00:26:54.905 --> 00:26:57.280
And just to give you some
examples of the kinds of things

00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.650
we've integrated
with already, there's

00:26:59.650 --> 00:27:01.510
XRP [INAUDIBLE]
plug-in, so that's

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.340
settling using the XRP Ledger.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.479
That's the most efficient
plug-in right now.

00:27:05.479 --> 00:27:07.270
That's one of the
reasons that we feel good

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:08.620
about this strategy.

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:10.090
We're actually
seeing, in practice,

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.130
that our own
products score really

00:27:12.130 --> 00:27:15.280
well on these different
metrics in terms of,

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.710
what ledger would you actually
choose for settlement?

00:27:17.710 --> 00:27:19.270
We've done a
Lightning integration.

00:27:19.270 --> 00:27:20.978
So we did a little
test where we actually

00:27:20.978 --> 00:27:23.740
connected the Bitcoin Lightning
Network and the Litecoin

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:24.960
Lightning Network together.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.020
If you're not familiar
with Lightning,

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.270
it's basically a
scalability overlay network

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:31.780
for currencies like Bitcoin.

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.489
And then you could do
something like ACH.

00:27:33.489 --> 00:27:35.154
You can even do cash
if you want, right?

00:27:35.154 --> 00:27:37.690
So you can have a relationship
with an Interledger service

00:27:37.690 --> 00:27:40.180
provider where it
basically says, I give you

00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:42.850
cash ahead of time, or you
give me cash ahead of time,

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:45.580
and then we can exchange
packets up to that amount

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.140
until we reach that
balance, and then

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:49.480
we have to settle up again.

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.750
OK, now with all
that prefix, I'm

00:27:52.750 --> 00:27:54.480
going to give you a
bit of a live demo.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.630
And this is going to go fairly
quick, so pay attention.

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:01.360
So basically what we're
going to show here

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:03.930
is the Easy Website Maker.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:06.990
So Easy Website Maker is an
app that somebody put together,

00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:09.220
just uploaded it to GitHub.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:11.890
And basically, it allows you
to create a website from just

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:13.150
having a little sketch.

00:28:13.150 --> 00:28:16.480
And now, obviously we didn't
build all the difficult parts--

00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.700
the AI parts.

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.810
That's what you guys are for.

00:28:19.810 --> 00:28:21.732
But we did do all
the payment stuff.

00:28:21.732 --> 00:28:24.190
So all the payments are actually
going through Interledger.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.290
There's actual payment
packets being exchanged.

00:28:26.290 --> 00:28:27.998
And we try to visualize
that a little bit

00:28:27.998 --> 00:28:31.457
later by having
a log of packets.

00:28:31.457 --> 00:28:33.040
And basically, what
this app does is--

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.270
I put in a sketch and it
goes to one vendor that's

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:38.950
offering an API--

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:43.300
a paid API-- that can turn
sketches into actual HTML.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:44.980
And then it'll go
pay another vendor

00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:47.920
to actually package that
into a Docker container

00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:49.390
and upload it somewhere.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:53.200
And then another vendor to
host the actual live website,

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.150
and then another
vendor to buy a domain.

00:28:55.150 --> 00:28:56.830
And finally, we'll
tip the developer.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.267
So I'll go show you
what that looks like.

00:28:59.267 --> 00:29:01.600
So first thing I need to do
is I need to pick my sketch.

00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.594
So I'm just going
to grab one here.

00:29:03.594 --> 00:29:05.260
And so this is the
sketch of my website.

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:07.051
This is probably a
little bit small to see,

00:29:07.051 --> 00:29:09.090
but it has some text and
it has a little chart,

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:10.300
and it has some more text.

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.495
And just to be clear,
again, the AI's mocked up.

00:29:12.495 --> 00:29:14.620
We didn't actually create
the AI just for the demo.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.970
That would be ridiculous.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:19.787
But yeah, in the future, this
could very well be possible.

00:29:19.787 --> 00:29:21.370
So now I'm going to
say, Make My Site.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.370
And now things are going
to happen very quickly.

00:29:23.370 --> 00:29:25.720
So it's going to upload
that sketch to that AI.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.650
It's already done.

00:29:26.650 --> 00:29:28.910
And now it's uploaded
the finished HTML

00:29:28.910 --> 00:29:31.510
to get back to a
service that turns it

00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:32.926
into the Docker container.

00:29:32.926 --> 00:29:34.300
And as you can
see on the right--

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:37.390
and I might do the demo twice
just so you can see it again.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:39.610
On the right, you saw
the total amount paid.

00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.770
This is in XRP
Drop, so this would

00:29:41.770 --> 00:29:43.070
be one-millionth of an XRP.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:47.530
So total paid would be
0.1 XRP, which is about--

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.230
what is that, like $0.02, $0.03?

00:29:50.230 --> 00:29:51.584
Sorry, $2, $3.

00:29:51.584 --> 00:29:52.750
CHRIS LARSEN: No many cents.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:53.666
STEFAN THOMAS: Point--

00:29:54.166 --> 00:29:56.530
CHRIS LARSEN: Sorry, $0.20.

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.860
STEFAN THOMAS: Yeah, it's like
$0.30 or something-- whatever.

00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.750
So you can see the
individual packets,

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:03.434
and there's a couple
things going on.

00:30:03.434 --> 00:30:05.350
And I think I will run
through the demo again,

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:06.340
just so you can see.

00:30:06.340 --> 00:30:11.230
So first, when we paid that AI,
we paid a one lump sum amount.

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.060
And then the
packager is actually

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:15.580
a streaming paid
end point, so that's

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.310
a paid end point where
as we send it data

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:20.320
and we ask it to do things,
we'll stream packets

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.880
to it to keep it paid.

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.950
And if we ever
don't keep up, it'll

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:26.660
stop working until
we pay it more.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.800
And then we deployed it to
a host, bought a domain,

00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.590
and then sent a tip
to the developer.

00:30:31.590 --> 00:30:33.850
And I can actually click
this button here and then

00:30:33.850 --> 00:30:34.810
look over here.

00:30:34.810 --> 00:30:36.670
And as you can see,
our website is now up,

00:30:36.670 --> 00:30:38.390
and I can actually show you.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:41.860
All this is running locally,
but we got a domain, et cetera,

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:43.940
just like set it up.

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.090
So let's go through
the demo one more time

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:49.060
just so you can see
the streaming payments

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:50.990
part a little bit better.

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:54.370
So I'll pick the same website.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.620
So here on the right, you
can see total paid right now

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:57.780
is 500 drops.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:59.015
That's to pay for the AI.

00:30:59.015 --> 00:31:01.140
Now we're streaming to
pay for the packager,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.870
so this is going in
250 drop intervals.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:08.460
And then we have a large
expense to host the web site--

00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:09.760
9,000 drops.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.480
It's over 9,000!

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.710
To actually buy the domain.

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.930
And then finally, we tip
the developer 1,000 drops.

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:18.600
And so if I make
an app like that,

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.062
I have a built-in
business model.

00:31:20.062 --> 00:31:22.270
And I that's really the key
point to get across here,

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:26.420
is I think this will have
a huge impact on the web.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.510
Think about-- if I start
a convenience store,

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.160
I don't need to think about
what my business model is.

00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.717
My business model
is-- people pay me

00:31:31.717 --> 00:31:32.800
when they come buy things.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.730
When I open a
restaurant, I don't

00:31:33.730 --> 00:31:34.980
think about my business model.

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:36.077
My business model is--

00:31:36.077 --> 00:31:37.660
people pay for the
food that they eat.

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.980
On the internet, we
have this weird thing

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.230
where there isn't a good
way to charge people

00:31:41.230 --> 00:31:44.110
for using your website, and
so we build advertising.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:47.350
We build subscriptions and
all kinds of hacky workarounds

00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:49.510
for how to get money
out of people just

00:31:49.510 --> 00:31:50.920
from visiting your website.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.980
And I think this will present
a pretty efficient alternative

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.480
in the future, where
people can just

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.130
pay you for using your site.

00:31:58.130 --> 00:31:58.780
So that's it.

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.330
And we can go back to this.

00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.230
Thank you.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:04.438
SPEAKER 1: Thank you, Stefan.

00:32:04.438 --> 00:32:06.808
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:08.498 --> 00:32:09.210
Cool.

00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.570
Now we'd like to open it up
to questions from you guys.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:14.420
Does anybody have any questions?

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.310
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the presentation again.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.340
Yeah, so there's a
lot of different coins

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:25.020
that deal with payments, like
Ripple, Litecoin, Stellar,

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.970
for example, that I've heard of.

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:30.630
Can you go a little bit
over the basic differences

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:32.700
between all those different
payment platforms?

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.930
And then also, do you see
one payment platform just

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:39.750
dominating and we all just
use one of them, or can

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:42.360
these somehow live in
harmony, kind of like USD

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.010
and euros and whatnot?

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:47.910
CHRIS LARSEN: So
on the second part,

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:50.160
I think it's going to shape
out a lot like what you're

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.200
seeing with fiat currencies.

00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:56.340
I mean, the world kind of has
four majors, maybe five majors,

00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.960
and then there's
everything else.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.100
And I think that probably plays
out here, simply because--

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.770
particularly with this Wall
Street wave that's coming,

00:33:07.770 --> 00:33:10.030
a lot of those institutions,
they're not buying--

00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:10.530
how many?

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:14.960
2,000 different coins
and platforms out there.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:20.070
They're grabbing top 10 or
5 or some smaller number.

00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.720
And in currencies,
liquidity begets liquidity.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:27.670
All of this is about,
how much liquidity

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:33.212
is supporting these platforms
and these currencies--

00:33:33.212 --> 00:33:35.170
or commodities, whatever
you want to call them?

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:37.930
There's still a lot of debate
on what they actually are.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:39.640
So I suspect that's
going to accelerate.

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.700
And that liquidity, then,
attracts more use cases.

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.530
For example, Ripple the company
focuses on the enterprise use

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:47.850
case.

00:33:47.850 --> 00:33:53.040
But we see XRP as very much a
general, global digital asset

00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.530
without a counterparty.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.960
So you'll see more
and more use cases

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.240
popping up from
different angles,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.650
and that just drives
more liquidity.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:04.370
So I think that's
probably the way it--

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:06.340
might be how it pans out.

00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:09.600
STEFAN THOMAS: Yeah, I think the
reason we developed Interledger

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.179
and the reason we built an
interoperability protocol

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.949
was because of that
exact realization.

00:34:13.949 --> 00:34:16.743
It wasn't going to be
everyone using one system.

00:34:16.743 --> 00:34:18.909
There was going to be a
number of different systems.

00:34:18.909 --> 00:34:21.719
And actually, behind it
is another realization,

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:23.820
which is-- my goal
has always been

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:28.500
to solve the problem of
friction payments, right?

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.469
And so I realized that
the centralization

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.739
wasn't necessarily the solution,
because you see PayPal.

00:34:34.739 --> 00:34:35.370
They come out.

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:35.966
They're free.

00:34:35.966 --> 00:34:37.590
Then eventually they
jack up their fees

00:34:37.590 --> 00:34:39.580
when they have an
established market position.

00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.496
But then you see Bitcoin
doing the same thing.

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:43.860
Not necessarily
with as much agency,

00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:46.000
but it still happens that way.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.510
And so what you got to think
about is, right now, when

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:50.370
you're on a payment
network, you can only

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:53.469
send money to the people
on the same network.

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:57.270
And that's kind of pre-internet
online services, where

00:34:57.270 --> 00:34:59.540
you could have CompuServe
and you can email anyone

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:02.426
on CompuServe and you
can use any services that

00:35:02.426 --> 00:35:04.800
are on CompuServe, but you
can't access any services that

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.720
are on GEnie, right?

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.910
And so CompuServe has this moat.

00:35:08.910 --> 00:35:11.520
They have a defensibility
around their reach.

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:14.006
And so that's really what
you got to commoditize

00:35:14.006 --> 00:35:15.130
and what you got to attack.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.727
And so with payments,
it's still that way today

00:35:17.727 --> 00:35:19.560
where if you're on the
same payment network,

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.640
you can pay each other.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.899
If you're on different
networks, you can't.

00:35:22.899 --> 00:35:24.690
If you want to pay from
your Paypal account

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:27.270
to a mobile money account
in Tanzania, you're screwed.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:28.330
You can't.

00:35:28.330 --> 00:35:31.502
Yet I can totally go on my
mobile phone in Tanzania

00:35:31.502 --> 00:35:33.210
and open any website
in the world, right?

00:35:33.210 --> 00:35:34.595
So we need that
interoperability,

00:35:34.595 --> 00:35:36.720
and that's really what
creates the competition that

00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:38.520
drives down the costs.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.740
The reason we think
that XRP is going

00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.890
to have a role in this system
is because we've been doing--

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:45.900
I mean, not to toot
our own horn too much,

00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:49.290
but we've been doing really
well in terms of the performance

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:51.427
and the characteristics
of the protocol.

00:35:51.427 --> 00:35:53.010
So I think a lot of
people will choose

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.890
to use XRP if there is
a lot of competition.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:58.020
Because right now,
you use Bitcoin

00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.230
even though it's expensive.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:01.484
You use Bitcoin even
though it's slow.

00:36:01.484 --> 00:36:03.150
I think if there's a
lot of competition,

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:04.650
people will pick
the most efficient,

00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:06.015
which would be XRP right now.

00:36:06.015 --> 00:36:08.070
CHRIS LARSEN: Yeah,
I'll add that as well.

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:11.040
It's an environment where a
lot of the volume, I think,

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:11.880
is speculative.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.520
I actually think
that kind of use case

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:19.080
has a greater tolerance
for cost speed--

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.740
doesn't really care, right?

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.230
Whereas as you start
getting into these use cases

00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:27.070
where you need millions
of some kind of unit,

00:36:27.070 --> 00:36:28.200
that matters a ton, right?

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.230
So as the ratio of real use
cases to speculative volume

00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:38.790
changes, I think that dynamic
becomes more important.

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:39.990
SPEAKER 1: Next question?

00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:40.980
CHRIS LARSEN: Thanks.

00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:42.630
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:36:42.630 --> 00:36:44.500
AUDIENCE: Hey, thanks
so much for coming.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.583
My question is around--
so if you're talking about

00:36:46.583 --> 00:36:50.430
that XRP and cryptos are
the internet of money,

00:36:50.430 --> 00:36:52.170
the big difference
between money and data

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:53.910
is that money is regulated.

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:58.020
And banks-- certainly if
they were the equivalent

00:36:58.020 --> 00:36:59.600
of running the
phone lines before,

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.630
have a pretty big incentive
to innovate and get ahead

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:06.330
of a change that is coming.

00:37:06.330 --> 00:37:09.040
So you could see them easily
upgrading the Swift protocol

00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:11.950
to be able to move money
internationally a lot quicker.

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:16.600
And so I'm curious how you guys
see specifically XRP living

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:18.370
in a more regulated space.

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:21.730
I think cryptos took the
world by storm and governments

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.140
are going to certainly
respond the next year or two.

00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:26.140
So why do you think
that XRP is going

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:30.010
to be able to live in a
much more regulated industry

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:34.000
than data is, especially because
you could see banks upgrading

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.850
Swift to be able
to support, maybe,

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:41.950
sub-minute transactions instead
of transactions that take days?

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.900
STEFAN THOMAS: I want
to like quickly question

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.180
some of the premises in there.

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:48.230
So I think a lot of
the people in the room,

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.090
I think, are young.

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.960
And so we grew up after
the deregulation of data.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.140
So the internet came out, and
a lot of the laws that were

00:37:56.140 --> 00:38:00.250
around before then-- copyright
law, cryptography laws,

00:38:00.250 --> 00:38:02.830
export restrictions
around algorithms,

00:38:02.830 --> 00:38:04.420
things of that nature--

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.340
actually got removed
and safe harbors

00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:08.740
got created, because
the internet posed

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:11.260
the technology that was, on
the one hand, very useful,

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.550
and on the other hand, kind
of in a legal gray area.

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.820
So I think that the
technology-- just if you use it,

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.850
it just feels so
incredibly useful that it's

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.960
hard to imagine how regulations
wouldn't be built around it.

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:25.450
I think that there's definitely
an opportunity for people

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:30.130
to be thoughtful and intelligent
about how they approach

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:31.570
the technology in the meantime.

00:38:31.570 --> 00:38:33.010
You want to be compliant.

00:38:33.010 --> 00:38:35.590
You want to do
everything that you

00:38:35.590 --> 00:38:38.020
can to stay within
the letter of the law,

00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:41.764
but there are going to be
ambiguities in terms of just--

00:38:41.764 --> 00:38:43.930
the law is not written for
these kinds of use cases.

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:46.540
So I think that's one thing.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:49.970
And then as far as XRP, I think
I'll hand it off to Chris.

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:52.241
CHRIS LARSEN: Yeah, I
mean, you're raising,

00:38:52.241 --> 00:38:53.240
I would say, a key part.

00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:55.660
And as I mentioned before,
the internet of value

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.390
is equal parts capital,
technology, and compliance.

00:38:59.390 --> 00:39:00.840
Compliance is hugely important.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:01.910
And the reason is simple.

00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:03.701
I don't think it's just
because governments

00:39:03.701 --> 00:39:05.260
want to have a monopoly.

00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.010
I think it's actually
more a question of--

00:39:09.010 --> 00:39:12.580
data's powerful, but money's
more powerful, right?

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:16.150
Data can show you a
life-saving medicine

00:39:16.150 --> 00:39:17.812
that your family might need.

00:39:17.812 --> 00:39:18.520
You can't buy it.

00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:19.720
Money can buy it.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.960
On the flip side, data
can encourage a terrorist

00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.760
to do something awful.

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.170
Money can buy the
weapons, right?

00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.891
So the stakes are higher--

00:39:27.891 --> 00:39:29.890
which, I think, actually,
this is going to have,

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.800
maybe, a more profound effect
on our Earth-- good and bad.

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.050
So regulators have got to be
there every step of the way.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:39.430
This fantasy that somehow this
is going to bypass governments

00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:41.810
and bypass compliance--
you know what?

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.140
That's just B.S.
And you know what?

00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.700
Nobody wants that.

00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:46.660
Nobody wants that.

00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:50.330
That is a champagne problem with
a bunch of rich young people

00:39:50.330 --> 00:39:52.490
that can sit there behind
their computer screens

00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:55.250
and block out a lot of bad
things that can happen.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.689
So it just can't go that way.

00:39:57.689 --> 00:39:59.980
And so I think we're trying
to think about that, trying

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.359
to be pragmatic about that.

00:40:01.359 --> 00:40:03.650
Because that's the only way
we're going to have impact.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.108
And if you look at people that
are trying to support what's

00:40:06.108 --> 00:40:08.990
going on in the
developing world,

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:10.797
they are very much
wanting to work.

00:40:10.797 --> 00:40:12.130
They're not trying to go around.

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.838
They're trying to work
within the system,

00:40:13.838 --> 00:40:16.460
because they know that's how
you're going to have impact.

00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:18.730
So that's the way we see it.

00:40:18.730 --> 00:40:21.590
Your question about
Swift, by the way--

00:40:21.590 --> 00:40:24.130
the problem with
that point of view

00:40:24.130 --> 00:40:26.410
is Swift only deals
with the data.

00:40:26.410 --> 00:40:28.150
They have a correspondent
banking partner

00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:30.670
that deals with the value,
and that's off any sense

00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:31.960
of an internet of value.

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:35.640
The whole point here is that
something like Interledger

00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:37.860
and XRP can eliminate
the correspondent, which

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:39.610
is actually where all
the juice is, right?

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.020
That's where all the waste is.

00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:42.860
That's where the
sediment risk is.

00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:44.110
That's where the failures are.

00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.460
That's where the time is.

00:40:45.460 --> 00:40:50.500
So Swift actually doesn't have
the combination of capabilities

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.971
to do what you're saying.

00:40:52.971 --> 00:40:53.470
Sorry.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:54.719
So thank you for the question.

00:40:57.911 --> 00:40:59.410
AUDIENCE: That's a
pretty cool demo,

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:03.540
and I just wanted to learn a
little bit behind the scene.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:05.530
For example, the AI--

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:11.180
how the full build AI
[INAUDIBLE] goes to the AI bot.

00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:15.220
STEFAN THOMAS: OK, so
we built a protocol that

00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:18.260
takes Interledger on
the one side and takes

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.710
HTTP on the other side,
and essentially you're

00:41:20.710 --> 00:41:21.880
making REST calls.

00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:24.790
You're making API calls
to these back ends.

00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:28.480
And the first time you make the
call, they'll respond with 402,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.850
payment required, which is
an error code in HTTP that

00:41:31.850 --> 00:41:32.910
was already reserved.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.910
And we were like, great.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.600
That works for our use case.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.535
And basically, it sends you
back a header that tells you

00:41:38.535 --> 00:41:39.910
all the information
that you need

00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:43.510
to know to make Interledger
payments to that exact end

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:46.670
point, or the API server
that runs that end point.

00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:48.730
And so that server
will be listening

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:53.260
for Interledger packets, in
addition to the HTTP requests.

00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:55.860
And so when you
start paying, yeah,

00:41:55.860 --> 00:41:57.880
it'll go back into
that same receiver,

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:01.090
and then the receiver
will then credit your--

00:42:01.090 --> 00:42:02.685
what we call a token.

00:42:02.685 --> 00:42:04.810
And then the next time you
make a request, it has--

00:42:04.810 --> 00:42:05.480
in the header--

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:06.087
your token.

00:42:06.087 --> 00:42:08.170
And so the receiver will
know that you've actually

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:10.740
funded that with some
packets, and then you

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.060
can proceed through the program.

00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.249
The streaming version of
the demo that you saw--

00:42:15.249 --> 00:42:16.790
that's a little bit
more complicated.

00:42:16.790 --> 00:42:19.030
This probably goes
beyond, but we can maybe

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.900
catch up about it later.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:23.740
And then one thing that's
also interesting is

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:26.560
that one of the services,
which is the thing that builds

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.260
a static site into
a Docker container,

00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:31.990
actually itself pays
another API, right?

00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:33.709
So you have another
API behind that.

00:42:33.709 --> 00:42:35.500
And so one of the things
that's really cool

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:36.874
is with these
streaming payments,

00:42:36.874 --> 00:42:40.301
we can actually have an
API that takes in money,

00:42:40.301 --> 00:42:41.800
and it immediately
spends it as it's

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.480
trying to process the request.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.330
And then maybe sends a little
bit as profit to the developer,

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:48.880
and then returns the result.
So there's a lot of cool stuff

00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.359
you can do with it.

00:42:50.359 --> 00:42:51.358
AUDIENCE: Great, thanks.

00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:57.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you guys
for coming to speak today.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:42:59.010
I'm curious to
learn more about how

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.990
you might prevent money
laundering and companies that

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.215
participate in--

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:12.980
the payday loan-type companies
from coming on the system, that

00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:15.450
exploit people financially.

00:43:15.450 --> 00:43:18.870
I'm interested to learn more
about that sort of thing.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:23.340
CHRIS LARSEN: Yeah,
so I think we really

00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:25.720
try to focus on the
bottom of the payment

00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:29.570
stack-- so on the
infrastructure part of it.

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:33.360
And again, a reason for that is
that a lot of the things that

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.300
prevent bad things from
happening are top of the stack,

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:38.460
and a lot of that
actually doesn't

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.870
need to be reinvented, right?

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:42.720
And the way we think
of it is, let's focus

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.860
on what's really changing.

00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:45.780
And we think this is
the interoperability.

00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.750
It's the idea of a digital
asset with no counterparty that

00:43:48.750 --> 00:43:51.155
can be sent anywhere in
the world that's neutral.

00:43:51.155 --> 00:43:52.530
So those are the
things, I think,

00:43:52.530 --> 00:43:58.440
that we can change and
then piggyback off of.

00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.669
The enterprise focus now
is that first beachhead.

00:44:02.669 --> 00:44:04.710
Piggyback off of what
already exists for hundreds

00:44:04.710 --> 00:44:08.050
of millions of people.

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:10.710
The other thing I would say is
that if this internet of value

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.150
becomes a reality, I
think the prevention

00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:15.600
of things like payday lending--

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.080
obviously, that has
to be regulated.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.160
That's a big part of
it at every level.

00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.800
But the other big thing to
what Stefan mentioned before

00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:26.130
is the commoditization of reach.

00:44:26.130 --> 00:44:28.470
If you have that,
suddenly now every market

00:44:28.470 --> 00:44:30.952
has way more competitors
for financial products.

00:44:30.952 --> 00:44:32.410
And there was some
that we saw-- we

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:35.350
had Prosper and E-loan-- we
got frustrated with because we

00:44:35.350 --> 00:44:36.300
were US-only.

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:39.330
You couldn't transport
it to another market,

00:44:39.330 --> 00:44:41.250
because you were in
another network, right?

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:45.240
This future vision, I
think, is that the world

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.430
is one big financial
supermarket,

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:50.610
and everybody is
competing in every market.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:52.260
I think that goes a long way.

00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:57.030
But you still need all the
other regulatory components

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.320
pretty much existing.

00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.905
Some may go away, but I'd say
probably most of them don't.

00:45:00.905 --> 00:45:02.655
I don't know what you
want to add to that.

00:45:02.655 --> 00:45:04.530
STEFAN THOMAS: Yeah,
I think that with--

00:45:04.530 --> 00:45:06.210
you mentioned
anti-money laundering.

00:45:06.210 --> 00:45:07.874
I think there's a
long list of things

00:45:07.874 --> 00:45:10.040
that are actually completely
separate issues, right?

00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.060
There's consumer risk.

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:14.370
There is any money laundering.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.689
There is anti-terrorism finance.

00:45:17.689 --> 00:45:19.230
There's all kinds
of different things

00:45:19.230 --> 00:45:21.688
that you have to think about
when you're building a payment

00:45:21.688 --> 00:45:22.360
system.

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:25.020
And so if you have
a stack like this,

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.000
they'll fit in different
parts of the stack.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.680
For instance, consumer
protection-- that

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.490
would fit in the
application layer.

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:32.880
So if you're building an
application where consumers

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.410
are sending money,
you have to think

00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:36.690
about how to protect those
consumers from sending it

00:45:36.690 --> 00:45:38.220
to the wrong people.

00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:41.190
If you think about
counterparty risk,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:44.266
that would fit in the
ledger layer, right?

00:45:44.266 --> 00:45:45.390
So you have a counterparty.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:47.181
They settle with you
on a certain schedule.

00:45:47.181 --> 00:45:49.740
How do you make sure they
actually settle with you?

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:53.500
So there are a myriad of
things to think about.

00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:55.674
I think that it's
illusory for us

00:45:55.674 --> 00:45:57.090
to come up with
all the solutions.

00:45:57.090 --> 00:45:59.040
I think we're trying to
be thoughtful in terms

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:01.800
of getting it to a point where
we can start experimenting

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.320
with it and get more
experience with it,

00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:06.930
but that's going to
require commercialization

00:46:06.930 --> 00:46:09.450
of the technology to
really think about all

00:46:09.450 --> 00:46:11.200
of those use cases.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:17.650
And I would also highlight that
Ripple has a commercial stack

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:19.380
and a commercial feature set.

00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.860
And that is very
much, like Chris

00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.330
said, riding within the
existing regulatory framework.

00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:26.130
And then we have
the open protocols,

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.530
which are maybe a little
bit more forward looking.

00:46:28.530 --> 00:46:29.520
And I think some
of those questions

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:30.561
are more difficult there.

00:46:30.561 --> 00:46:33.321
So what you saw us present today
is the more forward looking

00:46:33.321 --> 00:46:33.820
stuff.

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.610
So I think some of those
questions are still open there.

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:37.860
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.310
CHRIS LARSEN: Thank you.

00:46:40.310 --> 00:46:44.340
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for the presentation.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:51.040
So since the tech is
currency agnostic,

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:54.630
what would be the incentive
to choose XRP over fiat

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.650
or any other cryptocurrency?

00:46:57.650 --> 00:46:59.400
STEFAN THOMAS: So this
is where I'd almost

00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.270
love to ask my colleague up
on stage, because we have

00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:05.130
our team who is actually
trying to integrate

00:47:05.130 --> 00:47:08.550
with these different digital
assets and different payment

00:47:08.550 --> 00:47:09.450
systems.

00:47:09.450 --> 00:47:14.430
And it's just many
orders of magnitude

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:18.180
of difference between XRP
and, let's say, Bitcoin.

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.860
And still several
orders of magnitude

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:22.120
between XRP and
something like Litecoin,

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:24.240
which is known as a
more efficient asset.

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.000
And it's just a
pleasure to work with.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.080
And part of it is it's been
designed for that, right?

00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.540
It's been designed to be
used as the settlement

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:36.420
asset in Interledger, and so
has a lot of functionality--

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.660
like payment channels
built in a certain way that

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:43.420
are incredibly efficient for
this particular use case.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:47.319
And so I think the big
answer-- the main answer-- is,

00:47:47.319 --> 00:47:49.110
right now, it's just
the best thing to use.

00:47:49.110 --> 00:47:49.950
We talked to people.

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:51.435
Hey, let's set up a connector.

00:47:51.435 --> 00:47:52.560
Well, what do we peer with?

00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.380
Well, we could use Litecoin,
or we could use XRP.

00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:58.920
But XRP will just be
cheaper, so let's use XRP.

00:47:58.920 --> 00:48:01.839
And so I think to the extent
that these connectors are going

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:03.630
to be competing with
each other and they're

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.882
trying to think
about their margins,

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:08.340
XRP is just going to look like
a very good option for them.

00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:09.756
CHRIS LARSEN: Yeah,
in this world,

00:48:09.756 --> 00:48:12.810
you'll need some
digital asset that

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:17.197
is super fast, super cheap,
endlessly scalable that

00:48:17.197 --> 00:48:18.780
will serve the world
very well, right?

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:22.770
Better than, let's say, using
$1 or using a euro, right?

00:48:22.770 --> 00:48:25.170
Something that is
neutral to any network.

00:48:25.170 --> 00:48:29.010
So we're absolutely confident
that some digital asset will

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:32.190
be a key part of this
internet of value,

00:48:32.190 --> 00:48:36.060
but we think that fast
cost and scalability are

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:37.269
going to be those key things.

00:48:37.269 --> 00:48:39.476
And that's what's going to
drive the liquidity that's

00:48:39.476 --> 00:48:41.570
going to make these
things really useful.

00:48:41.570 --> 00:48:43.770
STEFAN THOMAS: XRP is
not static, either.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.200
We're constantly thinking
about how to help improve it.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:47.700
There's a community
out there that's

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.075
thinking about
how to improve it.

00:48:49.075 --> 00:48:51.180
So you can expect that
it will get better,

00:48:51.180 --> 00:48:54.367
as well, as time goes on.

00:48:54.367 --> 00:48:55.450
SPEAKER 1: Final question.

00:48:58.039 --> 00:48:58.580
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:02.870
So I was listening in the very
beginning of your presentation

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:06.560
about how you think XRP's
better over Bitcoin in the sense

00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.822
that Bitcoin's a lot slower,
a lot more expensive.

00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:11.280
But it's there for
a reason, right?

00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:15.290
Because it requires at least
six confirmation across network

00:49:15.290 --> 00:49:17.875
in order for instance
action to happen, and that

00:49:17.875 --> 00:49:20.550
is their [INAUDIBLE] to address
the double-spending problem.

00:49:20.550 --> 00:49:22.790
So I was just curious,
in your own words,

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:25.157
how does the XRP address
the double-spend problem

00:49:25.157 --> 00:49:27.240
if it's just a confirmation
between the two nodes?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.310
STEFAN THOMAS: Yeah.

00:49:28.310 --> 00:49:31.160
So if you're not
technical, please

00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.767
do something else
for a little bit,

00:49:33.767 --> 00:49:36.350
because there's no way to answer
that question without getting

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:37.516
into some of the technology.

00:49:37.516 --> 00:49:40.370
So Bitcoin uses a
consensus process

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:42.530
which is essentially based
around the assumption

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:44.990
that a majority of
hashing power will never

00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:48.770
be held by a coordinated
malicious attacker.

00:49:48.770 --> 00:49:51.890
And so if you're watching what
the majority of hashing power

00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:56.090
is doing, you'll tend to be
on a state of the network that

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:59.240
is reasonable and doesn't
contain reverted transactions

00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:00.330
and so on.

00:50:00.330 --> 00:50:03.880
However, the protocol as such
does allow rollbacks, right?

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.810
So you can-- if somebody
else presents you

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:08.060
with a chain that's longer,
it has more hashing power

00:50:08.060 --> 00:50:10.040
behind it-- you will
rollback your transactions

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.180
and switch to that.

00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.610
And I know that, because I
was one of the first people

00:50:13.610 --> 00:50:18.040
to implement a full node Bitcoin
reimplementation from scratch.

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:20.540
So I wrote that code, and it's
a very complex, annoying code

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.040
to write.

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:23.390
So I will remember that forever.

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:25.530
On the Ripple side, such
code does not exist.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.477
There's no way to
roll back the network.

00:50:27.477 --> 00:50:28.560
Now, how is that possible?

00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:31.310
Well, the way that
Ripple works is--

00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:34.610
as I mentioned before, the
users select these validators,

00:50:34.610 --> 00:50:36.680
and then we essentially
use that input

00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.550
as an input to an
algorithm where

00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:43.220
we look at the graph of what
people selected and then we

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:47.690
run a consensus on validators
that are central to that graph,

00:50:47.690 --> 00:50:50.780
or that are highly
trusted in that graph.

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.710
And so it's this
two-step process.

00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:55.580
And what that means is that
when the first step is complete

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:59.060
and you've identified which
validators you're looking for,

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.600
you don't have to worry
about there being more

00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:04.490
hashing power just
over the horizon.

00:51:04.490 --> 00:51:06.230
Once you hear from
the validators that

00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:10.430
you've identified as being
the ones that are validating--

00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:12.320
or the ones that
you're listening to--

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.690
then you don't have to worry
about some other validator

00:51:14.690 --> 00:51:17.000
coming in later saying, no,
actually, we decided this.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.500
You just didn't
hear about it yet.

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:22.419
And so there's no need to roll
back or to rewrite history.

00:51:22.419 --> 00:51:24.460
Once the validators have
committed to a decision,

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.850
they can't change their
minds, essentially.

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:30.510
And so that has a
couple of impacts--

00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:32.030
a couple of ways
that the protocol's

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.690
different because of that.

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.075
Number one, you only have to
wait for one confirmation.

00:51:35.075 --> 00:51:36.950
You wouldn't wait for
multiple confirmations,

00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:39.050
because validators
can't change their mind.

00:51:39.050 --> 00:51:42.830
You can't roll back, so there's
no probabilistic aspect to it.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:48.140
Number two is we can
create blocks on a cadence.

00:51:48.140 --> 00:51:51.710
So we can create blocks on
a fixed interval as opposed

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:53.780
to a random interval
like Bitcoin,

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:56.350
where blocks can come
out very close together.

00:51:56.350 --> 00:51:58.460
There could be no
block for a long time.

00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.960
Because we know
which validators are

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:01.310
supposed to generate blocks.

00:52:01.310 --> 00:52:03.650
They can generate
them on that cadence.

00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:06.050
And then finally--

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.670
I think-- did I
cover everything?

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:09.250
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:10.500
STEFAN THOMAS: Yeah, whatever.

00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.337
There's a really good talk on--

00:52:12.337 --> 00:52:13.920
well, I shouldn't
call it really good,

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.370
but there's a talk by
myself on consensus--

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:18.200
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.702
--that you can find from the
Consensus 2017 conference

00:52:20.702 --> 00:52:22.410
where I go into a
little bit more detail.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:24.284
And I'm also happy to
talk to you afterwards.

00:52:24.284 --> 00:52:26.744
But that's the high
level, quick description.

00:52:26.744 --> 00:52:27.410
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.910
Chris--

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:30.320
STEFAN THOMAS: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:32.250
SPEAKER 1: Guys, thank
you so much for coming.

00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:33.870
Do you have any
final statements,

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:36.161
or do you want to tell people
how they can get involved

00:52:36.161 --> 00:52:37.965
in the Ripple community at all?

00:52:37.965 --> 00:52:39.590
STEFAN THOMAS: Yeah,
so for Interledger

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.365
there's interledger.org--
which, at the time of recording,

00:52:42.365 --> 00:52:44.490
is horribly out of date,
but hopefully by next week

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.550
should be showing all of
the latest, great stuff.

00:52:47.550 --> 00:52:50.334
There's a community group at
the W3C called the Interledger

00:52:50.334 --> 00:52:51.000
Community Group.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.520
That's open to anyone
to just register.

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.030
We have mailing lists
where we discuss

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.140
how these protocols
work together,

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.020
all the code for the
demos and everything.

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:03.780
You can find that on
GitHub.com/interledger

00:53:03.780 --> 00:53:06.240
and /interledgerjs.

00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.280
And then for Ripple, ripple.com.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:10.590
If you're a bank, let us know.

00:53:10.590 --> 00:53:12.320
Reach out if you're
a payment provider.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:14.820
Maybe if you work for Google
Payments or anything like that,

00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:15.850
let us know.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.830
And then there's another project
which we didn't really mention

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.797
today, but that's also--

00:53:21.797 --> 00:53:23.880
was also used in the demo
in the background, which

00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:24.600
is called Codius.

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:27.030
So that's basically
the hosting system

00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:29.640
that's paid with Interledger,
and we uploaded that website

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.790
to it.

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.790
There's a lot of cool use
cases around hosting--

00:53:32.790 --> 00:53:34.780
if you think about serverless
hosting, et cetera.

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.946
So if you're into that,
there's codius.org as well--

00:53:36.946 --> 00:53:38.639
C-O-D-I-U-S-- .org.

00:53:38.639 --> 00:53:39.430
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:53:39.430 --> 00:53:41.280
Chris, Stefan, thank
you so much for coming.

00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:41.900
Really appreciate it.

00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:42.733
Give it up for them.

00:53:42.733 --> 00:53:45.770
[APPLAUSE]
