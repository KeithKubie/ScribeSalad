00:00:00.255 --> 00:00:01.906
- [Voiceover] We've
already made several videos

00:00:01.906 --> 00:00:03.065
over evolution,

00:00:03.065 --> 00:00:04.647
and just to remind ourselves

00:00:04.647 --> 00:00:06.097
what evolution is talking about,

00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:07.764
it's the change in heritable traits

00:00:07.764 --> 00:00:10.537
of a population over generations.

00:00:10.537 --> 00:00:12.977
And a lot of times, you'll
hear people say evolution

00:00:12.977 --> 00:00:15.983
and Natural Selection
really in the same breath,

00:00:15.983 --> 00:00:18.648
but what we wanna make a little
bit clear in this video is

00:00:18.648 --> 00:00:22.846
that Natural Selection is
one mechanism of evolution.

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:24.419
It's the one most talked about

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:27.956
because it is viewed as
the primary mechanism.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.645
Natural Selection.

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:30.478
But what we're gonna talk about

00:00:30.478 --> 00:00:34.508
in this video is another
mechanism called Genetic Drift.

00:00:34.508 --> 00:00:36.087
So there's Natural Selection,

00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:38.337
and there is Genetic Drift.

00:00:40.094 --> 00:00:42.959
Now we've done many videos
on Natural Selection,

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:47.518
but it's this idea that you
have variation in a population,

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.630
you have different heritable traits,

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.995
and I'm gonna depict those
with different colors here.

00:00:52.995 --> 00:00:56.541
We have a population of
living circles here, (laughs)

00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:00.291
and they could come in
blue or maybe magenta.

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:04.319
Maybe they come in another variation too,

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.032
maybe there is yellow circles,

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:09.867
and Natural Selection is all about

00:01:09.867 --> 00:01:14.594
which of these traits are
most fit for the environment

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:16.500
so that they can reproduce.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.663
So there might be something
about being, say, blue,

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:24.584
that allows those circles
to reproduce faster,

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:27.515
or to be less likely to
be caught by predators,

00:01:27.515 --> 00:01:30.432
or to be able to stalk prey better.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.401
Even if they're only slightly
more likely to reproduce,

00:01:34.401 --> 00:01:37.151
over time, over many generations,

00:01:38.396 --> 00:01:42.066
their numbers will increase and dominate,

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:45.233
and the other numbers are less likely,

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:50.738
or the other trait is
less likely to survive,

00:01:50.738 --> 00:01:53.398
and so we will have this Natural Selection

00:01:53.398 --> 00:01:55.320
for that blue trait.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.261
So this is all about traits
being the fittest traits.

00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:02.847
Now Genetic Drift is also
change in heritable traits

00:02:02.847 --> 00:02:04.705
of a population over generations,

00:02:04.705 --> 00:02:07.362
but it's not about the
traits that are most fit

00:02:07.362 --> 00:02:11.035
for an environment are the
ones that necessarily survive.

00:02:11.035 --> 00:02:14.118
Genetic Drift is really about random.

00:02:17.145 --> 00:02:18.395
Random changes.

00:02:19.378 --> 00:02:21.426
Random changes,

00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:25.012
and a good example of that
I have right over here

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:26.527
that we got from,

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:27.533
I'll give proper credit,

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:30.700
this is from OpenStax College Biology,

00:02:32.684 --> 00:02:35.979
and this shows how Genetic
Drift could happen.

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:36.820
So right over here,

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.987
I'm showing a very small
population of 10 rabbits,

00:02:42.493 --> 00:02:45.076
and we have the gene for color,

00:02:47.505 --> 00:02:50.903
and we have two versions of that gene,

00:02:50.903 --> 00:02:52.432
or we could call them two alleles.

00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:54.705
You have the capital B version,

00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:56.208
and you have the lower case B,

00:02:56.208 --> 00:02:58.547
and capital B is dominant.

00:02:58.547 --> 00:03:00.835
This is kind of a very Mendelian example

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:01.932
that we're showing here.

00:03:01.932 --> 00:03:05.489
And so if you have two
of lower case genes,

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.660
two of the white alleles,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:07.676
you're going to be white.

00:03:07.676 --> 00:03:11.485
If you have two of the brown
alleles, the capital Bs,

00:03:11.485 --> 00:03:12.640
you're going to be brown,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.045
and if you're a heterozygote,

00:03:14.045 --> 00:03:15.362
you're still going to be brown.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:19.993
So as you can see here, there
are several heterozygotes

00:03:19.993 --> 00:03:22.506
in this fairly small population.

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.398
But if you just count the capital Bs

00:03:24.398 --> 00:03:25.826
versus the lower case Bs,

00:03:25.826 --> 00:03:28.730
you see that we have an
equal amount of each.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.438
And so the frequency,

00:03:30.438 --> 00:03:33.422
if you were to pick a random
allele from this population,

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:34.255
you're just as likely

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:38.131
to pick a capital B than a lower case B.

00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:39.264
Even though the phenotype,

00:03:39.264 --> 00:03:40.576
you see a lot more brown,

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:45.183
but these six brown here
have both the upper case B

00:03:45.183 --> 00:03:47.077
and the lower case B.

00:03:47.077 --> 00:03:48.825
Now let's say they're in a population

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:51.313
where whether you are brown
or whether you are white,

00:03:51.313 --> 00:03:54.047
it confers no advantage.

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:57.396
There's no more likelihood
of surviving and reproducing

00:03:57.396 --> 00:03:58.982
if you're brown than white,

00:03:58.982 --> 00:04:00.816
but just by chance,

00:04:00.816 --> 00:04:03.237
by pure random chance,

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:06.699
the five bunnies on the top are the ones

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.053
that are able to reproduce,

00:04:08.053 --> 00:04:10.342
and the five bunnies on
the bottom are not the ones

00:04:10.342 --> 00:04:12.009
that are able to reproduce.

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:14.138
And you might be saying hey,
why did I pick those top five?

00:04:14.138 --> 00:04:15.638
I didn't pick them, I'm
just giving an example.

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:17.028
It could've been the bottom five.

00:04:17.028 --> 00:04:18.370
It could've been only these two,

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.045
or the only two white ones were the ones

00:04:20.045 --> 00:04:21.246
that were able to reproduce.

00:04:21.246 --> 00:04:23.594
It's by pure random chance,

00:04:23.594 --> 00:04:26.944
or it could be because of
traits that are unrelated

00:04:26.944 --> 00:04:29.957
to the alleles that we are talking about.

00:04:29.957 --> 00:04:31.775
But from the point of
view of these alleles,

00:04:31.775 --> 00:04:33.449
it looks like random chance.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:36.198
And so in the next generation,

00:04:36.198 --> 00:04:38.493
those five rabbits reproduce

00:04:38.493 --> 00:04:41.946
and you could have a situation like this,

00:04:41.946 --> 00:04:44.171
and just by random chance, as you can see,

00:04:44.171 --> 00:04:47.577
the capital B allele
frequency has increased

00:04:47.577 --> 00:04:51.958
from 50% of the alleles
in the population to 70%.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.811
And then it could be
another random chance,

00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.354
and I'm not saying this is
necessarily going to happen.

00:04:55.354 --> 00:04:56.450
It could happen the other way.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.522
It could happen even though

00:04:58.522 --> 00:05:00.058
that first randomness happened,

00:05:00.058 --> 00:05:03.262
maybe now all of a sudden
this white rabbit is able

00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:04.095
to reproduce a lot,

00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:05.514
but maybe not.

00:05:05.514 --> 00:05:07.402
Maybe these two brown rabbits

00:05:07.402 --> 00:05:09.993
that are homozygous for
the dominant trait are able

00:05:09.993 --> 00:05:10.826
to reproduce,

00:05:10.826 --> 00:05:12.983
and one again it has
nothing to do with fitness.

00:05:12.983 --> 00:05:14.243
And so they're able to reproduce,

00:05:14.243 --> 00:05:15.477
and then all of a sudden,

00:05:15.477 --> 00:05:19.644
the white allele is completely
gone from the environment.

00:05:21.195 --> 00:05:22.513
And the reason why this happened isn't

00:05:22.513 --> 00:05:25.308
because the white allele somehow
makes the bunnies less fit.

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:27.234
In fact, it might have
even conferred a little bit

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:28.067
of an advantage.

00:05:28.067 --> 00:05:29.638
It might have been,

00:05:29.638 --> 00:05:32.104
from the environment that the
bunnies are in point of view,

00:05:32.104 --> 00:05:33.844
it might have even been a better trait,

00:05:33.844 --> 00:05:36.022
but because of random chance,

00:05:36.022 --> 00:05:38.855
it disappears from the population.

00:05:39.935 --> 00:05:42.114
And the general idea
with the Genetic Drift,

00:05:42.114 --> 00:05:43.930
so once again, just to compare,

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.018
Natural Selection,

00:05:45.018 --> 00:05:46.448
you are selecting,

00:05:46.448 --> 00:05:48.031
or the environment is selecting traits

00:05:48.031 --> 00:05:50.026
that are more favorable for reproduction,

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:52.136
while Genetic Drift is random changes.

00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:55.272
Random changes in reproduction
of the population.

00:05:55.272 --> 00:05:56.274
Now, as you can imagine,

00:05:56.274 --> 00:05:58.362
I just gave an example with 10 bunnies,

00:05:58.362 --> 00:06:00.695
and what I just described
is much more likely

00:06:00.695 --> 00:06:03.187
to happen with small populations.

00:06:03.187 --> 00:06:05.137
So much more likely.

00:06:05.137 --> 00:06:06.054
More likely

00:06:10.299 --> 00:06:12.216
with small populations.

00:06:15.106 --> 00:06:18.434
And we have videos on
statistics on Khan Academy,

00:06:18.434 --> 00:06:19.991
but the likelihood of this happening

00:06:19.991 --> 00:06:22.318
with 10 bunnies versus the likelihood

00:06:22.318 --> 00:06:24.927
of what I just described happening

00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:27.962
with 10 million bunnies is very different.

00:06:27.962 --> 00:06:31.365
It's much more likely to
happen with a small population.

00:06:31.365 --> 00:06:33.363
So a lot of the contexts
of Genetic Drift are

00:06:33.363 --> 00:06:35.319
when people talk about small populations.

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.324
In fact, many times Biologists are worried

00:06:37.324 --> 00:06:38.907
about small populations specifically

00:06:38.907 --> 00:06:40.871
because of Genetic Drift.

00:06:40.871 --> 00:06:44.379
For random reasons, you
could have less diversity,

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:46.482
less variation in your population,

00:06:46.482 --> 00:06:50.399
and even favorable traits
could be selected for

00:06:51.943 --> 00:06:53.360
by random chance.

00:06:54.394 --> 00:06:58.790
There's two types of Genetic
Drift that are often called out

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.094
that cause extreme
reductions in population,

00:07:02.094 --> 00:07:04.981
and significantly reduce the populations.

00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:07.717
One is called the Bottleneck Effect.

00:07:07.717 --> 00:07:09.410
Let me write this down.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:10.577
So the Bottle,

00:07:11.752 --> 00:07:12.669
Bottleneck,

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:16.211
the Bottleneck Effect,

00:07:16.211 --> 00:07:19.084
and then the other is
called the Founder Effect.

00:07:19.084 --> 00:07:20.734
Do that over here.

00:07:20.734 --> 00:07:21.734
The Founder,

00:07:23.285 --> 00:07:24.535
Founder Effect.

00:07:27.168 --> 00:07:28.721
They are both ideas

00:07:28.721 --> 00:07:30.812
where you have significant
reduction in population

00:07:30.812 --> 00:07:32.324
for slightly different reasons.

00:07:32.324 --> 00:07:36.491
Bottleneck Effect is you have
some major disaster or event

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.432
that kills off a lot of the population,

00:07:39.432 --> 00:07:43.420
so only a little bit of the
population is able to survive.

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:45.094
And the reason why it's
called Bottleneck is imagine

00:07:45.094 --> 00:07:46.977
if you had a bottle here.

00:07:46.977 --> 00:07:48.515
If you had a bottle here and, I dunno,

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:49.854
inside of that bottle,

00:07:49.854 --> 00:07:52.393
you had marbles of different colors.

00:07:52.393 --> 00:07:55.060
So you have some yellow marbles,

00:07:56.675 --> 00:07:59.175
you have some magenta marbles,

00:08:01.843 --> 00:08:05.454
you have some, I don't know, blue marbles.

00:08:05.454 --> 00:08:07.829
These are the colors
that I tend to be using.

00:08:07.829 --> 00:08:09.800
You have some blue marbles,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:13.564
so you have a lot of variation
in your original population.

00:08:13.564 --> 00:08:16.905
But if you think about
pouring them out of a bottle,

00:08:16.905 --> 00:08:19.032
maybe somehow there's some major disaster,

00:08:19.032 --> 00:08:21.116
and only two of these survive,

00:08:21.116 --> 00:08:23.090
or let's say only four of these survive,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:24.238
and so you could view that as,

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:25.771
"Well, what are the marbles
that are getting poured

00:08:25.771 --> 00:08:27.693
"out of the bottle?"

00:08:27.693 --> 00:08:28.543
It's really just a metaphor.

00:08:28.543 --> 00:08:29.730
Obviously, we're not putting populations

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:30.946
of things in bottles.

00:08:30.946 --> 00:08:32.937
But after that disaster,

00:08:32.937 --> 00:08:34.673
only a handful survive,

00:08:34.673 --> 00:08:37.380
and they might not have any traits

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.542
that are in any way more
desirable or more fit

00:08:39.542 --> 00:08:42.094
for the environment than everything else,

00:08:42.094 --> 00:08:43.421
but they just by random chance,

00:08:43.421 --> 00:08:45.087
because of this disaster,

00:08:45.087 --> 00:08:46.702
they are the ones that survived.

00:08:46.702 --> 00:08:47.535
And so all of a sudden,

00:08:47.535 --> 00:08:49.758
you have a massive reduction
not only in the population,

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:52.830
but also in the variation
in that population,

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.929
and many alleles might
have even disappeared,

00:08:54.929 --> 00:08:57.595
and so you have an extreme form

00:08:57.595 --> 00:09:01.161
of Genetic Drift actually occurring.

00:09:01.161 --> 00:09:03.994
Another example is Founder Effect,

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:09.411
which is the same idea of a
population becoming very small,

00:09:09.411 --> 00:09:12.699
but the Founder Effect isn't
because of a natural disaster.

00:09:12.699 --> 00:09:13.958
Let's say you had a population.

00:09:13.958 --> 00:09:17.777
Once again, you have a
lot of different alleles

00:09:17.777 --> 00:09:18.610
in that population.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.943
You have a lot of variation,

00:09:21.895 --> 00:09:26.231
you have a lot of variation
in that population.

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:29.026
So let me just keep coloring it.

00:09:29.026 --> 00:09:31.210
You have a lot of variation
in this population,

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:32.467
and let's say that,

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:35.001
you know, they're all
hanging out in their region,

00:09:35.001 --> 00:09:36.668
and maybe, you know,

00:09:38.334 --> 00:09:40.365
they are surrounded by mountains.

00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:42.104
I'm just making this up as I go,

00:09:42.104 --> 00:09:44.864
but let's say a couple of
these blue characters were

00:09:44.864 --> 00:09:46.716
out walking one day,

00:09:46.716 --> 00:09:49.024
and they maybe get separated

00:09:49.024 --> 00:09:50.762
from the rest of their population.

00:09:50.762 --> 00:09:54.611
Maybe they discover a little
undiscovered mountain pass,

00:09:54.611 --> 00:09:57.925
and they go settle a new
population someplace.

00:09:57.925 --> 00:09:59.410
So that's why it's called
the Founder Effect.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.542
These are the founders
of a new population,

00:10:01.542 --> 00:10:03.363
and once again, by random chance,

00:10:03.363 --> 00:10:04.921
they just have a lot less variation.

00:10:04.921 --> 00:10:05.985
They're a smaller population

00:10:05.985 --> 00:10:08.106
and they happen to be disproportionately

00:10:08.106 --> 00:10:10.011
or all blue in this case,

00:10:10.011 --> 00:10:14.178
and so now this population
is going to (mumbles)

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.800
Just the process of this was Genetic Drift

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.341
where many alleles will have disappeared

00:10:21.341 --> 00:10:24.314
because you have such a small
population of blues here.

00:10:24.314 --> 00:10:26.140
And also because you have
such a small population,

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.150
you're likely to have
even more Genetic Drift.

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.110
So it's a really interesting
thing to think about.

00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:33.345
Evolution and Natural
Selection are often talked

00:10:33.345 --> 00:10:34.524
about hand in hand,

00:10:34.524 --> 00:10:38.490
but Natural Selection isn't the
only mechanism of Evolution.

00:10:38.490 --> 00:10:40.038
You also have Genetic Drift,

00:10:40.038 --> 00:10:40.904
which is really about,

00:10:40.904 --> 00:10:43.018
not selecting for favorable traits,

00:10:43.018 --> 00:10:44.935
it is about randomness.
