00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.135
- [Voiceover] We're asked to determine

00:00:01.135 --> 00:00:04.036
whether each expression is equivalent to

00:00:04.036 --> 00:00:07.287
the seventh root of v to the third power.

00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:08.910
And, like always, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.054
figure out which of
these are equivalent to

00:00:11.054 --> 00:00:14.189
the seventh root of v to the third power.

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:15.969
Well, a good way to figure
out if things are equivalent

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.168
is to just try to get
them all in the same form.

00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:22.361
So, the seventh root of
v to the third power,

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:23.353
v to the third power,

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:24.994
the seventh root of
something is the same thing

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.363
as raising it to the 1/7 power.

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:30.411
So, this is equivalent
to v to the third power,

00:00:30.411 --> 00:00:33.640
raised to the 1/7 power.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.825
And if I raise something to
an exponent and then raise

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:39.132
that to an exponent, well
then, that's the same thing as

00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:41.828
raising it to the product
of these two exponents.

00:00:41.828 --> 00:00:43.189
So, this is going to be the same thing as

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:47.285
v to the three times 1/7 power,

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:50.045
which, of course, is 3/7.

00:00:50.045 --> 00:00:52.754
3/7.

00:00:52.754 --> 00:00:54.870
So, we've written it
in multiple forms now.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.565
Let's see which of these match.

00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:58.957
So, v to the third to the 1/7 power,

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:00.721
well, that was the form that
we have right over here,

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:04.227
so that is equivalent.

00:01:04.227 --> 00:01:05.852
V to the 3/7.

00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:07.277
That's what we have right over here,

00:01:07.277 --> 00:01:10.560
so that one is definitely equivalent.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.645
Now, let's think about this one.

00:01:11.645 --> 00:01:14.672
This is the cube root of v to the seventh.

00:01:14.672 --> 00:01:17.333
Is this going to be equivalent?

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:19.507
Well, one way to think about it,

00:01:19.507 --> 00:01:22.028
this is going to be the same thing as

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.272
v to the 1/3 power ...

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:26.877
actually, no, this wasn't the
cube root of v to the seventh,

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:30.323
this was the cube root of v,
and that to the seventh power.

00:01:30.323 --> 00:01:33.158
So, that's the same thing
as v to the 1/3 power,

00:01:33.158 --> 00:01:35.712
and then, that to the seventh power.

00:01:35.712 --> 00:01:39.590
So, that is the same thing
as v to the 7/3 power,

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.941
which is clearly different
to v to the 3/7 power.

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:48.889
So, this is not going to
be equivalent for all v's,

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.016
all v's for which this
expression is defined.

00:01:52.016 --> 00:01:55.565
Let's do a few more of these,
or similar types of problems

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:59.976
dealing with roots and
fractional exponents.

00:01:59.976 --> 00:02:01.719
The following equation is true for g

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:06.035
greater than or equal to
zero, and d is a constant.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:07.949
What is the value of d?

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:09.512
Well, if I'm taking the
sixth root of something,

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:12.448
that's the same thing as
raising it to the 1/6 power.

00:02:12.448 --> 00:02:16.014
So, the sixth root

00:02:16.014 --> 00:02:19.184
of g to the fifth, is the same thing as

00:02:19.184 --> 00:02:23.374
g to the fifth, raised to the 1/6 power.

00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:26.013
And, just like we just
saw in the last example,

00:02:26.013 --> 00:02:30.316
that's the same thing as g
to the five times 1/6 power.

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.919
This is just our exponent properties.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.474
I raise something to an exponent and then

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.401
raise that whole thing
to another exponent,

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:37.233
I can just multiply the exponents.

00:02:37.233 --> 00:02:38.454
So, that's the same thing as

00:02:38.454 --> 00:02:42.514
g to the 5/6 power.

00:02:42.514 --> 00:02:46.460
And so d is 5/6.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.818
Five over six.

00:02:47.818 --> 00:02:50.243
The sixth root of g to the
fifth is the same thing

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:53.583
as g to the 5/6 power.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:55.460
Let's do one more of these.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.249
The following equation is
true for x greater than zero,

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.648
and d is a constant.

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:02.142
What is the value of d?

00:03:02.142 --> 00:03:03.078
Alright, this is interesting.

00:03:03.078 --> 00:03:04.921
And I forgot to tell
you in the last one, but

00:03:04.921 --> 00:03:06.167
pause this video as
well and see if you can

00:03:06.167 --> 00:03:08.683
work it out on ...or pause
for this question as well

00:03:08.683 --> 00:03:10.736
and see if you can work it out.

00:03:10.736 --> 00:03:13.250
Well, here, let's just start rewriting

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.952
the root as an exponent.

00:03:14.952 --> 00:03:16.761
So, I can rewrite the whole thing.

00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.287
This is the same thing as one over,

00:03:18.287 --> 00:03:20.225
instead of writing the seventh root of x,

00:03:20.225 --> 00:03:23.541
I'll write x to the 1/7 power

00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:26.241
is equal to x to the d.

00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:28.521
And if I have one over
something to a power,

00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:29.890
that's the same thing as that something

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860
raised to the negative of that power.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:33.588
So, that is the same thing as

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:38.388
x to the negative 1/7 power.

00:03:38.388 --> 00:03:41.947
And so, that is going to
be equal to x to the d.

00:03:41.947 --> 00:03:44.678
And so, d must be equal to,

00:03:44.678 --> 00:03:48.472
d must be equal to negative 1/7.

00:03:48.472 --> 00:03:50.465
So, the key here is when
you're taking the reciprocal

00:03:50.465 --> 00:03:52.651
of something, that's the
same thing as raising it

00:03:52.651 --> 00:03:54.880
to the negative of that exponent.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.213
Another way of thinking about it is

00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:01.395
you could view this as,

00:04:01.395 --> 00:04:03.285
you could view it as,

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:06.626
x to the 1/7

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:08.666
to the negative one power.

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:10.417
And then, if you multiply these exponents,

00:04:10.417 --> 00:04:12.747
you get what we have right over there.

00:04:12.747 --> 00:04:17.700
But, either way, d is
equal to negative 1/7.
