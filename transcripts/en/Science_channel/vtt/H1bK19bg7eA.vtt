00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.467
Narrator: GREAT BRITAIN NOW...

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:05.834
THIS IS HOW YOU
HIGH FIVE A BEE.

00:00:05.834 --> 00:00:08.801
WHERE RICHARD BROWN IS ABUZZ
ABOUT HIS NEW BEST FRIEND.

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:10.400
Richard: HEY, BEE. HIGH FIVE.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.534
Wrigglesworth:
I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE.

00:00:12.534 --> 00:00:15.434
I'D LIKE TO SEE SOMEBODY
FIST BUMPING A WASP.

00:00:15.434 --> 00:00:17.334
Richard: HEY, BEE.
HIGH FIVE.

00:00:17.334 --> 00:00:19.434
TOTALLY FAKE.
I GIVE THIS VIDEO A "B."

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:22.167
Narrator: SO ARE RICH
AND THE BEE REALLY BFFs?

00:00:22.167 --> 00:00:23.767
Richard: HEY, BEE. HIGH FIVE.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:27.100
ALTHOUGH THIS CLIP MAY
SEEM "UN-BEE-LIEVABLE,"

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.467
IT'S 100 PERCENT REAL.

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:30.000
THIS MIGHT LOOK LIKE
THEY'RE FRIENDS.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.934
BUT THIS BEE IS
NOT BEING FRIENDLY.

00:00:31.934 --> 00:00:33.400
QUITE THE OPPOSITE.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.667
Bondar: HE'S ACTUALLY ACTIVATING
A DEFENSE MECHANISM IN THE BEE,

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:38.167
SOMETHING CALLED POSTURING,

00:00:38.167 --> 00:00:40.567
BASICALLY THE BEE'S WAY
OF SAYING, "GET OUT OF HERE."

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.667
Ruben:
IF RICH KEEPS GETTING CLOSER,
IT MIGHT PUT UP A SECOND LEG.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.601
AND EVEN CLOSER THAN THAT,
IT COULD ROLL ON ITS BACK

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.834
AND PRESENT ITS STINGER.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:48.467
THIS IS NATURE'S
CLEAR WAY OF SAYING,

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:50.567
"HEY, I HAVE THIS SHARP THING.

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:52.834
COME CLOSER,
AND IT WILL BE IN YOU."

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.067
Bondar: GENERALLY SPEAKING,

00:00:54.067 --> 00:00:56.501
BUMBLEBEES ARE NOT
AGGRESSIVE INSECTS,

00:00:56.501 --> 00:00:59.400
AND IN FACT THEY PLAY
AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ROLE

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.300
IN POLLINATING MANY
OF THE FRUITS

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.100
THAT WE LIKE TO EAT.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.133
SO DON'T ANNOY THEM, BECAUSE
YOU MIGHT GET HURT AND HUNGRY.
