we are going to spend a lot of the day

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159
we are going to spend a lot of the day
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.249
we are going to spend a lot of the day
thinking about the way that digital

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259
thinking about the way that digital
 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.539
thinking about the way that digital
intelligence is going to change the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549
intelligence is going to change the
 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.950
intelligence is going to change the
world and we thought it would be

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960
world and we thought it would be
 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.540
world and we thought it would be
interesting to take a moment to think

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550
interesting to take a moment to think
 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.549
interesting to take a moment to think
about how all this interaction with

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
about how all this interaction with
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.270
about how all this interaction with
computers might be changing us so we're

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280
computers might be changing us so we're
 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.580
computers might be changing us so we're
gonna have a brief conversation about

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590
gonna have a brief conversation about
 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.170
gonna have a brief conversation about
that question and who better to talk

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
that question and who better to talk
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.150
that question and who better to talk
about it then sherry turkle who's a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160
about it then sherry turkle who's a
 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.720
about it then sherry turkle who's a
sociologist from MIT who spent three

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730
sociologist from MIT who spent three
 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310
sociologist from MIT who spent three
decades looking at the way that we

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320
decades looking at the way that we
 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.889
decades looking at the way that we
interact with computers so sherry please

00:00:32.889 --> 00:00:32.899
 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:41.479
hi good to see so you've been on

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
hi good to see so you've been on
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.069
hi good to see so you've been on
something of an evolutionary journey

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
something of an evolutionary journey
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.160
something of an evolutionary journey
that I think it's fair to say that some

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170
that I think it's fair to say that some
 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.600
that I think it's fair to say that some
time ago you were a great fan of

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610
time ago you were a great fan of
 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.369
time ago you were a great fan of
technology and now you've evolved to a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
technology and now you've evolved to a
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.410
technology and now you've evolved to a
point at which many might describe you

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420
point at which many might describe you
 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.529
point at which many might describe you
as a critic tell me very briefly about

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539
as a critic tell me very briefly about
 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:06.230
as a critic tell me very briefly about
that journey we have a problem with a

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240
that journey we have a problem with a
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.010
that journey we have a problem with a
microphone you want to try again yeah I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020
microphone you want to try again yeah I
 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.810
microphone you want to try again yeah I
don't think of myself as a critic I not

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820
don't think of myself as a critic I not
 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.560
don't think of myself as a critic I not
anti-technology I'm pro conversation so

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570
anti-technology I'm pro conversation so
 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.560
anti-technology I'm pro conversation so
my criticism really is of technology

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
my criticism really is of technology
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.590
my criticism really is of technology
where um if we were sitting together and

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
where um if we were sitting together and
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.390
where um if we were sitting together and
this has become something that just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400
this has become something that just
 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.399
this has become something that just
people do I would say to you will just

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409
people do I would say to you will just
 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.469
people do I would say to you will just
hold on a second I need to check my

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479
hold on a second I need to check my
 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.080
hold on a second I need to check my
phone and then come back to you as

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
phone and then come back to you as
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.060
phone and then come back to you as
though I had put you on pause I mean

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
though I had put you on pause I mean
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.249
though I had put you on pause I mean
that's kind of my that's my kind of

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
that's kind of my that's my kind of
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.889
that's kind of my that's my kind of
criticism is where technology stands in

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899
criticism is where technology stands in
 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.560
criticism is where technology stands in
the way of the kinds of conversations

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570
the way of the kinds of conversations
 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.359
the way of the kinds of conversations
where intimacy thrives were empathy

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369
where intimacy thrives were empathy
 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.539
where intimacy thrives were empathy
thrives on in terms of my evolution how

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549
thrives on in terms of my evolution how
 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.490
thrives on in terms of my evolution how
I got started was being very pro and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500
I got started was being very pro and
 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.780
I got started was being very pro and
excited about technology because i

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
excited about technology because i
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789
excited about technology because i
thought the technology was starting a

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
thought the technology was starting a
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.149
thought the technology was starting a
lot of new kinds of conversations and

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
lot of new kinds of conversations and
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.060
lot of new kinds of conversations and
this was in the late 1970s at the birth

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070
this was in the late 1970s at the birth
 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.999
this was in the late 1970s at the birth
of the personal computer movement I

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009
of the personal computer movement I
 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.639
of the personal computer movement I
called the computer a second self

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649
called the computer a second self
 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.930
called the computer a second self
because I saw the way people were

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940
because I saw the way people were
 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.200
because I saw the way people were
really looking at what they put on their

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210
really looking at what they put on their
 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.240
really looking at what they put on their
screens as a projection of who they were

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250
screens as a projection of who they were
 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.220
screens as a projection of who they were
and had a relationship with these

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230
and had a relationship with these
 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.440
and had a relationship with these
technologies that really was more

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
technologies that really was more
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.280
technologies that really was more
intense and involved in the tip than the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290
intense and involved in the tip than the
 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.020
intense and involved in the tip than the
relationship they had with cars or

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030
relationship they had with cars or
 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.840
relationship they had with cars or
stereos because they saw the computer

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850
stereos because they saw the computer
 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.030
stereos because they saw the computer
and their own computer really is a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040
and their own computer really is a
 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.980
and their own computer really is a
reflection of their own minds but that

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990
reflection of their own minds but that
 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.140
reflection of their own minds but that
that is just enhance now that is more

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150
that is just enhance now that is more
 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.960
that is just enhance now that is more
the case now and yet you're feeling

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970
the case now and yet you're feeling
 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.790
the case now and yet you're feeling
about the effect that that's having has

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800
about the effect that that's having has
 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.760
about the effect that that's having has
become more negative well now we're in a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770
become more negative well now we're in a
 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.900
become more negative well now we're in a
different space where the phones that we

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910
different space where the phones that we
 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.940
different space where the phones that we
carry the mobile technologies that we

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950
carry the mobile technologies that we
 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.790
carry the mobile technologies that we
carry are not just a projection of

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800
carry are not just a projection of
 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.090
carry are not just a projection of
ourselves but connect us you know with

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100
ourselves but connect us you know with
 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.510
ourselves but connect us you know with
the world of other people in ways that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520
the world of other people in ways that
 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.430
the world of other people in ways that
paradoxically can interrupt our

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440
paradoxically can interrupt our
 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.260
paradoxically can interrupt our
involvement with other people and I

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270
involvement with other people and I
 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:08.880
involvement with other people and I
think that's the kind of paradoxical

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890
think that's the kind of paradoxical
 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.650
think that's the kind of paradoxical
moment we're at where we're just

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660
moment we're at where we're just
 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.590
moment we're at where we're just
figuring out how to make sure that these

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600
figuring out how to make sure that these
 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.460
figuring out how to make sure that these
phones keep us in contact with the world

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
phones keep us in contact with the world
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.540
phones keep us in contact with the world
rather than really cut short our contact

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550
rather than really cut short our contact
 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.580
rather than really cut short our contact
with the world so for example research

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590
with the world so for example research
 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.740
with the world so for example research
shows that if I put a phone down on the

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750
shows that if I put a phone down on the
 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.470
shows that if I put a phone down on the
table if we were having lunch two things

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480
table if we were having lunch two things
 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.880
table if we were having lunch two things
would happen what we talked about would

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890
would happen what we talked about would
 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.800
would happen what we talked about would
become more trivial at that lunch

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810
become more trivial at that lunch
 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.690
become more trivial at that lunch
because people wouldn't want to be

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700
because people wouldn't want to be
 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.660
because people wouldn't want to be
interrupted and so the conversation kind

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670
interrupted and so the conversation kind
 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.140
interrupted and so the conversation kind
of flattens out to more trivial things

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
of flattens out to more trivial things
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.330
of flattens out to more trivial things
and then also the parties and the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340
and then also the parties and the
 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.940
and then also the parties and the
conversation feel less empathically

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950
conversation feel less empathically
 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.300
conversation feel less empathically
connected to each other so what you want

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310
connected to each other so what you want
 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.449
connected to each other so what you want
to do was not not use your phone but you

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459
to do was not not use your phone but you
 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.640
to do was not not use your phone but you
want to think about not putting your

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650
want to think about not putting your
 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.400
want to think about not putting your
phone out during lunch you want to think

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410
phone out during lunch you want to think
 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.020
phone out during lunch you want to think
about not putting your phone out when

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030
about not putting your phone out when
 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.160
about not putting your phone out when
you're having breakfast with your

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170
you're having breakfast with your
 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.729
you're having breakfast with your
children that sounds pretty hard to do I

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739
children that sounds pretty hard to do I
 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:07.770
children that sounds pretty hard to do I
can't imagine children listening to that

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780
can't imagine children listening to that
 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.380
can't imagine children listening to that
instruction no actually I found that

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390
instruction no actually I found that
 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:12.240
instruction no actually I found that
it's the other way around that i found a

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
it's the other way around that i found a
 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.340
it's the other way around that i found a
generation of children who were kind of

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350
generation of children who were kind of
 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.490
generation of children who were kind of
tugging at the sleeves of their parents

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500
tugging at the sleeves of their parents
 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.409
tugging at the sleeves of their parents
asking for more attention so I'm

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419

role of a person and do things for you
 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.610
role of a person and do things for you
and interact with you so that's a

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620
and interact with you so that's a
 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:40.140

feel about those well I would say that

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770
feel about those well I would say that

the two technologies that brought me to
 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.170
the two technologies that brought me to
a more critical position we're on the

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180
a more critical position we're on the
 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.779
a more critical position we're on the
one hand the sort of always on always on

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789
one hand the sort of always on always on
 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.430
one hand the sort of always on always on

sociable technologies that are of a
certain sort the ones that I think we

00:06:02.309 --> 00:06:02.319
certain sort the ones that I think we
 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:04.050
certain sort the ones that I think we
need to rethink or think very carefully

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060
need to rethink or think very carefully
 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:07.079

about are the ones that pretend empathy

because in all of the wonderful

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:09.339
because in all of the wonderful
 

00:06:09.339 --> 00:06:11.040
because in all of the wonderful
intelligence that we've been talking

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050
intelligence that we've been talking
 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:14.879
intelligence that we've been talking
about that machines can have the thing

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889
about that machines can have the thing
 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:18.320
about that machines can have the thing
that they can't have and that I think we

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330
that they can't have and that I think we
 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.700
that they can't have and that I think we
interfere with children's development

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710
interfere with children's development
 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.610
interfere with children's development
when we pretend they can is that they

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620
when we pretend they can is that they
 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.980
when we pretend they can is that they
can't have human empathy they can't have

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990
can't have human empathy they can't have
 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.219

had the experiences that human being has
 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.409
had the experiences that human being has
gone through and so as in my own

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419
gone through and so as in my own
 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.600
gone through and so as in my own
development of the researcher I began to

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610
development of the researcher I began to
 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.110
development of the researcher I began to
see machines that evoked in children the

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120
see machines that evoked in children the
 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.210
see machines that evoked in children the
feeling that they were

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:39.220
feeling that they were
 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.520
feeling that they were
with machines that pretended empathy I

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530
with machines that pretended empathy I
 

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:44.640
with machines that pretended empathy I
was also caught short and felt that

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.650
was also caught short and felt that
 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:46.650
was also caught short and felt that
there was something to be concerned with

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:46.660
there was something to be concerned with
 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.660
there was something to be concerned with
here but not just children also the

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670
here but not just children also the
 

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.000
here but not just children also the
elderly because I think we have a

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010
elderly because I think we have a
 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:53.990
elderly because I think we have a
tendency to think that we can give as

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000
tendency to think that we can give as
 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.030

companions for example machines that

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040
companions for example machines that
 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.760
companions for example machines that
pretend to empathy both to children and

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770
pretend to empathy both to children and
 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.460
pretend to empathy both to children and
also to the elderly and I think in the

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470
also to the elderly and I think in the
 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.790
also to the elderly and I think in the
case of the elderly um break our compact

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800
case of the elderly um break our compact
 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.150
case of the elderly um break our compact

they're telling so I was doing research

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930
they're telling so I was doing research
 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.680
they're telling so I was doing research
with one woman who was trying to talk

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:16.690
with one woman who was trying to talk
 

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:18.870
with one woman who was trying to talk
about the death of the child and to a

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:18.880
about the death of the child and to a
 

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.180
about the death of the child and to a
robot that was pretending to understand

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190
robot that was pretending to understand
 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:23.700
robot that was pretending to understand
and of course it did not and was

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:23.710
and of course it did not and was
 

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.980
and of course it did not and was
heartbreaking I mean I suppose that

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990
heartbreaking I mean I suppose that
 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.020
heartbreaking I mean I suppose that
there are always replacements for human

which they empathize to a certain degree
so this is just a new dimension of it

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:35.800
so this is just a new dimension of it
 

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.320
so this is just a new dimension of it

and just needs to be handled in the same
 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:39.030
and just needs to be handled in the same
way as we handle those other things no I
