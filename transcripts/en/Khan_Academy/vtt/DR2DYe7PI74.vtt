00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:06.040
Let's see if we can
write 0.15 as a fraction.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.900
So the important
thing here is to look

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.550
at what place these
digits are in.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.370
So this 1 right over here,
this is in the tenths place,

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.550
so you could view
that as 1 times 1/10.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.590
This 5 right over here is
in the hundredths place,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.700
so you could view
that as 5 times 1/100.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.320
So if I were to rewrite
this, I can rewrite this

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.080
as the sum of-- this 1
represents 1 times 1/10,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.480
so that would literally
be 1/10 plus--

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.860
and this 5 represents
5 times 1/100,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.380
so it would be plus 5/100.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:41.910
And if we want to
add them up, we

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.870
want to find a
common denominator.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.890
The common denominator is 100.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.480
Both 10 and-- the
least common multiple.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.720
100 is a multiple
of both 10 and 100.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.734
So we can rewrite this
as something over 100

00:00:55.734 --> 00:00:59.516
plus something over 100.

00:00:59.516 --> 00:01:00.640
This isn't going to change.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.750
This was already 5/100.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.650
If we multiply the
denominator here

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.894
by 10-- that's what we did;
we multiplied it by 10--

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:10.310
then we're going to have to
multiply this numerator by 10.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.686
And so this is the
same thing as 10/100.

00:01:12.686 --> 00:01:13.810
And now we're ready to add.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.660
This is the same thing
as-- 10 plus 5 is 15/100.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.010
And you could have done that
a little bit quicker just

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.860
by inspecting this.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.109
You would say, look, my
smallest place right over here

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:27.260
is in the hundredths place.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.590
Instead of calling this
1/10, I could call this

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.860
literally 10/100.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.710
Or I could say this
whole thing is 15/100.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.914
And now if I want to reduce
this to lowest terms,

00:01:37.914 --> 00:01:40.330
we can-- let's see, both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.030
are divisible by 5.

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.590
So let's divide them both by 5.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.410
And so the numerator,
15 divided by 5, is 3.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.800
The denominator, 100
divided by 5, is 20.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.890
And that's about as
simplified as we can get.
