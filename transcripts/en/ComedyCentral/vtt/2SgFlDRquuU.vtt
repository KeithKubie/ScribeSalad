00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:02.835
Mike Cernovich, how are you?
- Nice to meet you finally.

00:00:02.868 --> 00:00:04.670
- Nice to meet you too.
Thanks for coming in.

00:00:04.703 --> 00:00:06.372
- I think I actually trolled
your show.

00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:09.575
- I'm sure you did.
- You and the--

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:11.511
I forget the rapper's name--did
a "Problematic," like,

00:00:11.544 --> 00:00:13.212
rap or something on cultural
appropriation.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.981
- Did I trigger you?
- You definitely didn't.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.015
- No?

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.650
- I thought it was kind of
funny.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:19.752
- You thought that the video was
funny or trolling me was funny?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.154
- Both
- Oh, yeah?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.556
- Yeah, yeah.
- Success.

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.525
So what is a cuck?

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:28.394
- I use it just to mean beta,
weak.

00:00:28.427 --> 00:00:31.497
I use it very--I wouldn't
consider you a cuck.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.865
- Really? Why not?
- No.

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.834
I would call you beta.
I would say you're beta male.

00:00:34.867 --> 00:00:36.536
- So I'm not all the way at
cuck.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:38.504
- Beta's just a non-aggressive,

00:00:38.537 --> 00:00:40.139
maybe a little bit passive of a
man.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.475
- Yeah, and with this kind of
hairstyle.

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.745
You get more respect for a cuck
or a beta than a normie?

00:00:45.778 --> 00:00:46.946
Like, at least that's something?

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:48.881
- No, normie's great.

00:00:48.914 --> 00:00:50.116
Normie's just, like, they don't
get it.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.351
For example, I don't do satire
anymore.

00:00:52.384 --> 00:00:53.519
Why not?

00:00:53.552 --> 00:00:54.520
Well, Normie's aren't gonna get
satire.

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:55.521
- You were so good at it.

00:00:55.554 --> 00:00:57.523
- Well, it's a little--

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.358
five years later, it doesn't age
well.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.794
- Do you hate the Left?
- Definitely not.

00:01:01.827 --> 00:01:02.795
That's why we're having a
conversation.

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:04.130
I usually say no.

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:06.699
I say--I've turned down "The
Daily Show."

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:07.900
I've turned down everybody.

00:01:07.933 --> 00:01:09.268
- Oh, and I appreciate you being
here.

00:01:09.301 --> 00:01:11.771
- I always say no to TV,
because all you people want

00:01:11.804 --> 00:01:13.439
to do is edit things out of
context.

00:01:13.472 --> 00:01:15.942
- I give you my word we would
never edit you out of context

00:01:15.975 --> 00:01:17.610
like that; that's not the kind
of show we do here.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:20.313
What's--what's the most cuck
thing you've ever done?

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:24.383
- I had sex with Bill Clinton
with a strap-on.

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:27.553
- Eww.
- Oh, yeah, skeet skeet.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:28.855
- All right

00:01:28.888 --> 00:01:30.790
What do you hope to accomplish
long-term?

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:36.095
- I like the idea of sucking
Hitler's penis.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:37.563
It's on the to-do list for sure.

00:01:37.596 --> 00:01:38.764
- Good. Okay.

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:40.066
Do people hate you?

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:41.501
- I deserve a lot of the hate
that I get.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:42.869
There are things that I've said
or done.

00:01:42.902 --> 00:01:44.837
I've been mean to people
gratuitously.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.272
You know, I wish I hadn't done
that.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:48.274
So when people are mean to me, I
just view that as karma.

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:51.244
- Yeah. What's the soundtrack of
the alt-right?

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.712
- 'Cause I like house music.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.247
<i> [upbeat house music]</i>

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.749
We love it.

00:01:56.782 --> 00:01:59.118
A lot of people ask me all the
time--people ask me

00:01:59.151 --> 00:02:00.786
what--think--about Hillary?

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.489
She's beautiful, intelligent...
house music.

00:02:03.522 --> 00:02:05.591
Trolled your show--
trolled your show.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:07.560
Hegelian dialectic.
Trolled your show.

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:09.095

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.096
Oh--oh, yeah.

- I love trolls.

00:02:11.997 --> 00:02:12.999

Oh, oh, yeah.
Oh, oh, yeah.

[laughs]

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.308
- Thanks for coming in, Mike.
I appreciate it, man.

Thanks for coming in.
