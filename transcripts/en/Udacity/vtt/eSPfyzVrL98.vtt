00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:05.540
So, in this lesson, what patterns are we going to learn? Well, we'll learn about

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.470
filtering patterns, we'll learn about summarization patterns,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.560
and something we'll call structural patterns. And

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.238
these are all just frameworks for using

00:00:15.238 --> 00:00:17.730
MapReduce for solve problems that you've probably

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.800
encountered as a programmer before. Filtering patterns

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.460
solve filtering problems. Like, sampling data, or,

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.760
maybe even generating some top-n list. Maybe,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.787
top ten something. Summarization patterns solve summarization problems. Getting

00:00:35.787 --> 00:00:41.230
a high-level view of your data. Things like counting records. Finding

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.960
min and max, then calculating basic statistical values, like

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.580
mean, median, and mode. We can also use these patterns to create

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.780
an index, finally, these structural patterns will solves structural

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.110
problems. And, the one more focus on, in this

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.460
lesson, is combining two data sets. And, just to

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.150
warn you, this lesson will go fast, and, that

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.030
means you probably won't remember everything about all of

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.820
these patterns. Totally okay, not expected. The point of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.820
this lesson, is for you to know that these

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.810
patterns exist. And that if you ever find yourself

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.470
in a situation with big data where you say this problem is really just a

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.130
filtering or a summarization problem. You'll know where

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.710
to look, to find a technique to solve.
