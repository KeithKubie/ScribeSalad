00:04:22.459 --> 00:04:22.469
this idea so in this paper we're asking
 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.900
this idea so in this paper we're asking
dude the passive investors effect

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910
dude the passive investors effect
 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.270
dude the passive investors effect
corporate governance there's certainly

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280
corporate governance there's certainly
 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.130
corporate governance there's certainly
reasons to think why the answer to this

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140
reasons to think why the answer to this
 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.950
reasons to think why the answer to this
may be no first off these passive

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960
may be no first off these passive
 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.720
may be no first off these passive
investors since they're unwilling to

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730
investors since they're unwilling to
 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.610
investors since they're unwilling to
accumulate shares or exit their

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620
accumulate shares or exit their
 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.730
accumulate shares or exit their
positions they may lack influence

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:37.740
positions they may lack influence
 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.530
positions they may lack influence
furthermore they may lack motivation if

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540
furthermore they may lack motivation if
 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.240
furthermore they may lack motivation if
they're only trying to mimic markets

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250
they're only trying to mimic markets
 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.040
they're only trying to mimic markets
returns and so they may not care about

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050
returns and so they may not care about
 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.420
returns and so they may not care about
the returns of one particular stock

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430
the returns of one particular stock
 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.530
the returns of one particular stock
however there's other reasons to think

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540
however there's other reasons to think
 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.750
however there's other reasons to think
that passive institutions may in fact

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760
that passive institutions may in fact
 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.420
that passive institutions may in fact
strengthen corporate governance so first

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430
strengthen corporate governance so first
 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:55.650
strengthen corporate governance so first
off these investors have a fiduciary

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660
off these investors have a fiduciary
 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.590
off these investors have a fiduciary
duty to their own investors furthermore

they may be motivated if fund flows

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670
they may be motivated if fund flows
 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.210

they care even more about corporate

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650
they care even more about corporate
 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.900
they care even more about corporate
governance than other types of investors

now ultimately answering this question

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310
now ultimately answering this question
 

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.730
now ultimately answering this question
poses an empirical challenge and this is

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740
poses an empirical challenge and this is
 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.710

for the simple reason that correlation
 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.040
for the simple reason that correlation
does not imply causation that is we may

does not imply causation that is we may
 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.930
does not imply causation that is we may
be worried about that firms with higher

passive ownership are different in other
 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.860
passive ownership are different in other
ways so for instance they could have

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870
ways so for instance they could have
 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:37.770
ways so for instance they could have
higher active ownership as well now in

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780
higher active ownership as well now in
 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.290
higher active ownership as well now in
order to disentangle these effects we

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300
order to disentangle these effects we
 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.180
order to disentangle these effects we
need to use what economists refer to as

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190
need to use what economists refer to as
 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:44.520
need to use what economists refer to as
a natural experiment that is we need

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530
a natural experiment that is we need
 

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.980
a natural experiment that is we need
some sort of quasi random variation in

some sort of quasi random variation in
 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.120
some sort of quasi random variation in
passive ownership so in this paper what

passive ownership so in this paper what
 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:52.380
passive ownership so in this paper what
we're going to do is we're going to use

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390
we're going to do is we're going to use
 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.260
we're going to do is we're going to use

pointing out that Russell has changed

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620
pointing out that Russell has changed
 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.650

this methodology in recent years but

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:22.660
this methodology in recent years but
 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:24.120
this methodology in recent years but
we're only looking at the period from

we're only looking at the period from
when this is precisely what they were

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:25.810
when this is precisely what they were
 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.190
when this is precisely what they were
doing now it's important to note that

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200
doing now it's important to note that
 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.159
doing now it's important to note that
these indices are value waited and so

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:32.169
these indices are value waited and so
 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:33.840
these indices are value waited and so
portfolio weights will vary considerably

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:33.850
portfolio weights will vary considerably
 

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:36.960
portfolio weights will vary considerably
around this threshold this is

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:36.970
around this threshold this is
 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:38.790
around this threshold this is
demonstrated in the following slide

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800
demonstrated in the following slide
 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.070
demonstrated in the following slide
so in the first panel we're plotting the

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080
so in the first panel we're plotting the
 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.890
so in the first panel we're plotting the
portfolio waits for the bottom 500 firms

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900
portfolio waits for the bottom 500 firms
 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.040
portfolio waits for the bottom 500 firms
in the Russell 1000 index and in the

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050
in the Russell 1000 index and in the
 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.570
in the Russell 1000 index and in the
second panel we're plotting the weights

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580
second panel we're plotting the weights
 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.149
second panel we're plotting the weights
for the top 500 firms in the Russell

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159
for the top 500 firms in the Russell
 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.850
for the top 500 firms in the Russell
2000 now as you would expect there's a

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860
2000 now as you would expect there's a
 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:56.249
2000 now as you would expect there's a
large jump in portfolio weights for

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:56.259
large jump in portfolio weights for
 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:57.869
large jump in portfolio weights for
stocks that are at the top of the

00:06:57.869 --> 00:06:57.879
stocks that are at the top of the
 

00:06:57.879 --> 00:07:01.320
stocks that are at the top of the
Russell 2000 now it turns out there's a

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330
Russell 2000 now it turns out there's a
 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:03.749
Russell 2000 now it turns out there's a
similar amount of assets tracking these

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:03.759
similar amount of assets tracking these
 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:06.390
similar amount of assets tracking these
two indices and so ultimately passive

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400
two indices and so ultimately passive
 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.249
two indices and so ultimately passive
ownership will be higher for stocks at

00:07:08.249 --> 00:07:08.259
ownership will be higher for stocks at
 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:13.499
ownership will be higher for stocks at
the top of the Russell 2000 and this is

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:13.509
the top of the Russell 2000 and this is
 

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.510
the top of the Russell 2000 and this is
demonstrated by the following figure so

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520
demonstrated by the following figure so
 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.309
demonstrated by the following figure so
here we're just taking the 500 the

00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319
here we're just taking the 500 the
 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:19.890
here we're just taking the 500 the
bottom 500 stocks in the Russell 1000

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900
bottom 500 stocks in the Russell 1000
 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.140
bottom 500 stocks in the Russell 1000
and the top 500 stocks in the Russell

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:22.150
and the top 500 stocks in the Russell
 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.330
and the top 500 stocks in the Russell
2000 and then we're just lining them up

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:24.340
2000 and then we're just lining them up
 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.059
2000 and then we're just lining them up
by market capitalization and as you

00:07:27.059 --> 00:07:27.069
by market capitalization and as you
 

00:07:27.069 --> 00:07:29.219
by market capitalization and as you
would expect there's a break in passive

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:29.229
would expect there's a break in passive
 

00:07:29.229 --> 00:07:31.379
would expect there's a break in passive
ownership at the cutoff between the two

interested in studying how these passive
 

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.080
interested in studying how these passive
investors influence governance we

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:46.090
investors influence governance we
 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.850
investors influence governance we
specifically focus on governance

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:47.860
specifically focus on governance

aspects of corporate governance so what

00:07:55.019 --> 00:07:55.029
aspects of corporate governance so what
 

00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:57.019
aspects of corporate governance so what
we find is that passive ownership is

00:07:57.019 --> 00:07:57.029
we find is that passive ownership is
 

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:59.339
we find is that passive ownership is
associated with more independent

00:07:59.339 --> 00:07:59.349
associated with more independent
 

00:07:59.349 --> 00:08:03.120
associated with more independent
directors we also find that passive

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.130
directors we also find that passive
 

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.100
directors we also find that passive
ownership is associated with a higher

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:05.110
ownership is associated with a higher
 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.559
ownership is associated with a higher
likelihood of removing anti-takeover

00:08:07.559 --> 00:08:07.569
likelihood of removing anti-takeover
 

00:08:07.569 --> 00:08:09.689
likelihood of removing anti-takeover
provisions so these could be things like

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:09.699
provisions so these could be things like
 

00:08:09.699 --> 00:08:11.730
provisions so these could be things like
poison pills or restrictions on

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:11.740
poison pills or restrictions on
 

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.499
poison pills or restrictions on
shareholders calling special meetings

00:08:13.499 --> 00:08:13.509
shareholders calling special meetings
 

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.189
shareholders calling special meetings
and finally we find that firms have

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199
and finally we find that firms have
 

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:19.439
and finally we find that firms have
fewer dual-class shares when passive

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:19.449
fewer dual-class shares when passive
 

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:21.360
fewer dual-class shares when passive
ownership is higher so there's one share

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:21.370
ownership is higher so there's one share
 

00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:23.159
ownership is higher so there's one share
one vote and this is a very another

00:08:23.159 --> 00:08:23.169
one vote and this is a very another
 

00:08:23.169 --> 00:08:24.779
one vote and this is a very another
another common thing that passive

00:08:24.779 --> 00:08:24.789
another common thing that passive
 

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:28.950
another common thing that passive
investors talk about we next look at

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960
investors talk about we next look at
 

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.959
investors talk about we next look at
what are the possible mechanisms that

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:30.969
what are the possible mechanisms that
 

00:08:30.969 --> 00:08:32.610
what are the possible mechanisms that
allow passive investors to have this

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:32.620
allow passive investors to have this
 

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.149
allow passive investors to have this
influence so one obvious possibility is

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159
influence so one obvious possibility is
 

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.550
influence so one obvious possibility is
the power of their voice these passive

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560
the power of their voice these passive
 

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.409
the power of their voice these passive
institutions hold very large stakes and

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:40.419
institutions hold very large stakes and
 

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.630
institutions hold very large stakes and
along with this comes significant voting

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:42.640
along with this comes significant voting
 

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.910
along with this comes significant voting
rights and so we find evidence that this

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920
rights and so we find evidence that this
 

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:46.970
rights and so we find evidence that this
is in fact an important mechanism

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:46.980
is in fact an important mechanism
 

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.500
is in fact an important mechanism
specifically we find that when passive

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:49.510
specifically we find that when passive
 

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:51.860
specifically we find that when passive
ownership is higher support for

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:51.870
ownership is higher support for
 

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.300
ownership is higher support for
shareholder governance proposals

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.310
shareholder governance proposals
 

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.519
shareholder governance proposals
non-binding resolutions is higher as

00:08:55.519 --> 00:08:55.529
non-binding resolutions is higher as
 

00:08:55.529 --> 00:08:58.700
non-binding resolutions is higher as
well furthermore we find that there's

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:58.710
well furthermore we find that there's
 

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.710
well furthermore we find that there's
lower support for management proposals

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720
lower support for management proposals
 

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.230
lower support for management proposals
when passive ownership is higher

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:02.240
when passive ownership is higher
 

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:05.030
when passive ownership is higher
suggesting that management faces a more

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040
suggesting that management faces a more
 

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.160
suggesting that management faces a more
hostile or a more discerning shareholder

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:07.170
hostile or a more discerning shareholder
 

00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.480
hostile or a more discerning shareholder
base in some sense we also investigate

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.490
base in some sense we also investigate
 

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:13.640
base in some sense we also investigate
the possibility that passive investors

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:13.650
the possibility that passive investors
 

00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:16.220
the possibility that passive investors
may be facilitating activism by other

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:16.230
may be facilitating activism by other
 

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:18.829
may be facilitating activism by other
types of investors for instance it could

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:18.839
types of investors for instance it could
 

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:21.380
types of investors for instance it could
be that if an activist investor can get

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:21.390

just one or two of these large passive

ultimately increase the chances that an

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:27.270
ultimately increase the chances that an
 

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:29.870
ultimately increase the chances that an
activist campaign will succeed however

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880
activist campaign will succeed however
 

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.730
activist campaign will succeed however
we don't find any evidence that that's

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:31.740
we don't find any evidence that that's
 

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:34.190
we don't find any evidence that that's
actually the case if anything we find

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:34.200
actually the case if anything we find
 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.040

that hedge fund activism declines when

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.050
that hedge fund activism declines when
 

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.710
that hedge fund activism declines when
passive ownership is higher and so this

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:39.720
passive ownership is higher and so this
 

00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.450
passive ownership is higher and so this
suggests that passive owners may be

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:41.460
suggests that passive owners may be
 

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.490
suggests that passive owners may be
pre-empting the need for activists to

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:43.500
pre-empting the need for activists to
 

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.220
pre-empting the need for activists to
come in in the first place finally we

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.230
come in in the first place finally we
 

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.040

turn our attention to performance

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.050
turn our attention to performance
 

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:53.690
turn our attention to performance
presumably passive investors care about

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700
presumably passive investors care about
 

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.280
presumably passive investors care about
corporate governance because they think

this will lead to improved firm
performance but it's not necessarily

could be concerns that these investors

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:14.940
could be concerns that these investors
 

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.090
could be concerns that these investors

are following a one-size-fits-all
 

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:18.650

this is something that may not be good

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:20.190
this is something that may not be good
 

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:24.050
this is something that may not be good
for firm performance however we find

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.060
for firm performance however we find
 

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.150
for firm performance however we find
that on average long-term performance

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:26.160
that on average long-term performance
 

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.550
that on average long-term performance
improves when passive ownership is

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560
improves when passive ownership is
 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.740
improves when passive ownership is
higher and so this suggests that the

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:30.750
higher and so this suggests that the
 

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:32.480

what was this quandary
 

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.800
what was this quandary
and it starts with a scientific

00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:23.810
and it starts with a scientific
 

00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.260
and it starts with a scientific
consensus the consensus is that we are

that path of warming and shoot for

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:35.750
that path of warming and shoot for
 

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.870
that path of warming and shoot for
something like a two degree Celsius

something like a two degree Celsius
 

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.269

we could still put a certain amount of

we could still put a certain amount of

we could still put a certain amount of
carbon emissions into the air now the

00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:45.140
carbon emissions into the air now the
 

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.720
carbon emissions into the air now the
problem is that the amount of carbon

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:46.730
problem is that the amount of carbon
 

00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:48.370
problem is that the amount of carbon
emissions that we can put into the air

emissions that we can put into the air
 

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:51.340
emissions that we can put into the air
would mean that we can really only burn

00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:51.350
would mean that we can really only burn
 

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:53.500
would mean that we can really only burn
about one third of the fossil fuel

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:53.510

of those fossil fuel reserves and how
 

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.290
