00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Well, let's see 5π/2--5/2 is 2.5π. Okay. Well, I know 2π is a full circle.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
So that's the sign we go back to where I am, but I still have half of π radian left to go--0.5π.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Well, I know 1π/2 does--0.5π--this brings me right here.

00:00:16.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So actually 5π/2 is exactly the same as π/2.
