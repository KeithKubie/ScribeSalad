&gt;&gt; David Moskowitz:
Good afternoon.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:04.610
Welcome everybody.

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:05.910
I'm David Moskowitz.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.210
I'm head of Government Relations

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.920
and Public Policy
at Wells Fargo.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.590
And I'm very pleased to
be here with you today.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.080
We are pleased to serve for the
eight year as a charter sponsor

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.850
of the Book Festival
and even prouder

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.510
to watch the Book Festival grow
into the incredibly popular

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.560
and impactful event
it has become.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.770
In fact, I wouldn't be
surprised-- [applause].

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.440
Thank you.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.590
I wouldn't be surprised
to see us move the needle

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:32.930
on some bestseller list today.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.080
But it's even more important

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.980
to keep the Book Festival a free
event that serves the community.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.600
The Library of Congress and the
Book Festival's real purpose

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.450
here is literacy, which leads
to learning and opportunity

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.490
which matches our goal of
helping our community succeed.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.240
Learning to love
books and learning

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.800
to love learning are what the
Book Festival is all about.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.990
In this session, Ron Chernow
will discuss his biography

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.350
of Ulysses S. Grant.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.160
If we're lucky, certain
other popular founding

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.620
fathers [laughter].

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.710
One thing I learned
from the story

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.870
of President Grant was
how people can evolve

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.490
and through persistence
and hard work, acknowledge

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.380
and overcome their
imperfections.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.590
It's an incredible story that
reminded me that a person

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.970
of goodwill can really
learn from their mistakes

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.630
and reach their potential.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:21.950
Hope you enjoy this session.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.390
Now it's my privilege to
introduce the deputy director

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080
of National and International
Outreach at the Library

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.660
of Congress and our
session moderator,

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.190
Colleen Shogan [applause].

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.490
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
[Applause] Thank you.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.060
Thank you.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.630
Welcome to the 18th Annual
National Book Festival.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.380
I'm pleased to be joined on
stage today by Ron Chernow.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.310
Ron is an award-winning
journalist,

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.380
historian, and biographer.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.020
He's won the Pulitzer
Prize for Biography

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.800
and the National Book
Award for Nonfiction.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.280
In 2015, he won the
National Humanities Medal.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.430
His book on Alexander
Hamilton was the inspiration

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.510
for the award-winning
musical for which Ron worked

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.420
as a historical consultant.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.430
The Library of Congress
is honored

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.510
to have you join us today at
the National Book Festival.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.650
[ Applause ]

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.850
That's-- It's worth noting that
our co-chair of the festival,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.250
Mr. David Rubenstein
was supposed

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.480
to conduct this interview today,
but due to scheduling changes,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.800
because of Senator McCain's
funeral, he was unable to do so.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.320
But I have David's
questions here today.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.790
And I just happened
to be a big admirer

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430
of Ulysses S. Grant
and Ron's books.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.740
So I think we're going to have
a fantastic time here today

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.120
at the Book Festival.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.080
Before we talk about Grant,
we need to ask a question

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.010
about Alexander Hamilton
[laughter].

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.070
How could we not?

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:53.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Who's he?

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.770
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Who's he?

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.970
So when Lin-Manuel Miranda
first approached you,

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:59.280
and said that he wanted

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.970
to create a hip-hop musical
based upon your book,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.630
what was your reaction?

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.310
And did you ever think it would
become a cultural phenomenon?

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well, you
know, very often, Colleen,

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.260
people say to me, "When you're
writing the Alexander Hamilton

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.620
biography, did you have any
idea that it would be turned

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.920
into a hip-hop musical?"

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.220
And I always think to myself,

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.000
I think the question
answers itself [laughter].

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.200
When I first met Lin-Manuel
Miranda, which was back

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.360
in the fall of 2008,
Lin was still starting

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.940
in his first musical,
"In the Heights".

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.410
And he asked me on the spot
to be the historical advisor

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.400
to this as yet nonexistent show.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.880
So I laughed and I
said to him, "You mean,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.040
you want me to tell you
when something is wrong?"

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.480
And he said with great
fervor, he said, "Yes,

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.380
I want the historians
to take this seriously,"

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.250
which was music to my years.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.360
And I was-- I was a
little bit skeptical

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.660
but I was quite intrigued,
and I thought

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.430
that nothing could
be more delightful

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.540
than to watch the evolution
of a Broadway musical.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.110
I was a lifelong theatergoer.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.270
And the offer to be
on the other side

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.740
of the foot lights was
absolutely irresistible.

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.340
And of course, it turned out
to be a rocket ride far, far--

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.640
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Right, absolutely.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: --

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.240
beyond anything that I
could have anticipated.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.540
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So
we move on to Grant,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.780
which you've certainly written
the definitive biography

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.080
of Grant.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.480
And I have to start with
kind of a cute question,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.260
but it has a good story to it.

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.590
Who's buried in Grant's tomb?

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Wow [laughter].

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:31.040
When I first started working
on the book which was in 2011,

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.220
I found that approximately half
the people whom I told I was

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.880
working on Grant shout back,
who's buried in Grant's tomb?

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.650
So naturally, I got
very interested

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.220
in the origin of this joke.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.060
Well, I traced it
back to Groucho Marx.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.150
You can trace everything back
to Groucho Marx [laughter].

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.510
And Groucho, some of you
are old enough to remember,

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:53.930
had a quiz show in the 1950s
called "You Bet Your Life."

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:56.050
And Groucho was dismayed
that so many

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.560
of the contestants could
not answer a single one

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.860
of the questions.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.440
So Groucho decided that he would
ask every contestant a question

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.600
that every contestant
could answer.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.810
And that question was, who's
buried in Grant's tomb?

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.200
To Groucho's astonishment,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.660
half the guests got
it wrong [laughter].

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.890
But such is the staying
power of the great comedian

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:21.300
that the line has become
part of the popular culture.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.940
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Let's start
at the beginning with Grant.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.240
Where was he born?

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.540
What were the conditions
of his upbringing?

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.840
What was his family like?

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: He was born
in Point Pleasant, Ohio.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.840
He grew up in the
series of small towns

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.080
in Southwestern Ohio
near Cincinnati.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.110
And Point Pleasant was
right on the Ohio River.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.690
And the significance of that was
that it separated the free state

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.120
of Ohio from the
slave-owning state of Kentucky.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.330
In fact, on winter evenings,
the Ohio would freeze over

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.250
and refugee, fugitive slaves
would sprint to freedom.

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.690
Very important I think in terms
of thinking about Grant later

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.750
with Appomattox that he grew
up really straddling, you know,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.350
the world of both
North and South

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.270
and understood both
of their cultures.

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.290
He came from actually
fairly well-to-do family.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.470
His father was a rich tanner and
mayor of one those three towns.

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:12.110
And his father was really
the bane of his life.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.150
His father was a very pushy
and domineering character.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.290
And then Grant went
to West Point

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.950
because Grant wanted
go to West Point?

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:23.770
No, he did not but his
father wanted him to go.

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.390
And his father was kind of a
skinflint who saw West Point

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:30.800
as a free form of
vocational education.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.130
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: How
did he do at West Point?

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Actually
fairly well.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.930
I would say his performance
was lackluster.

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.060
He was 21st in the class of 39

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.140
but there was already
considerable attrition

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:44.720
before that.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.860
He became famous for two
things at the academy.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.260
One was he was probably the
best horsemen of his generation,

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.030
if not century at the academy.

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.870
He established a high-jumping
record on his horse named York.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.610
They set the bar at
more than five feet

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:00.110
and Grant managed to clear it.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:02.150
It was a record that
was not equalled

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.210
for many decades at the academy.

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.630
He was also very
good at drawing.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.010
Now, this may seem
strange and insignificant,

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.600
but cadets required drawing
because it was thought important

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:15.570
for generals to be able to
draw maps during battles,

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:18.100
and Grant was very
good at drawing.

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:21.200
And during the Civil War,
he had an uncanny ability

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.920
to visualize the battlefield.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:27.000
And it all comes from this
very visual sense that he had,

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.630
and it was first reflected
in his capacity to draw.

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: After
West Point, he has a number

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.970
of assignments, then
he eventually ends

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.270
up as a quartermaster
in the Mexican War.

00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:39.370
Why is his service
as a quartermaster,

00:07:39.370 --> 00:07:40.740
why does that turned
out to be important?

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Extremely
important

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:47.440
because being quartermaster
in Mexico gave Grant a nuts

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:50.500
and bolts knowledge of
the logistics of an army.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.090
And kind of looking ahead
to the Civil War, you know,

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.810
Grant would be in
charged of four

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.690
or five different
armies stretched

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:59.830
across 1300-mile front.

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.380
And so Grant's mastery
of logistics,

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.010
his mastery of the railroad and
the telegraph really enabled him

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.710
to supervise these vast
armies, and it goes back

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.730
to being quartermaster
at Mexico.

00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:14.200
And also very importantly
as quartermaster,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.860
Grant was not obligated
to actually fight.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:19.930
He could have stayed
behind the lines,

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:24.810
but he may appoint volunteering
to fight in every single combat

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:27.010
that his troops were involved.

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:29.380
And that's kind of real
courage, that's real patriotism.

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.680
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: After Mexican
War, he marries Julia Dent.

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.340
And what was she like and
what was her family like?

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: OK.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:38.810
So, Grant comes from this
abolitionist family in Ohio.

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:42.460
He marries into a
slave-owning family in Missouri.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.610
His father-in-law,
Colonel Frederick Dent.

00:08:44.610 --> 00:08:46.240
The colonel was purely
honorific,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.760
becomes bane of his life.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.620
It's very hard on Grant.

00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.950
Julia was very outgoing
and vivacious.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:56.820
And Julia always had a
vision of Grant's future

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.380
that he sometimes
did not have himself.

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:04.240
During the 1850s, he's trying
and failing to establish himself

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.750
as a farmer in St. Louis and he
fails at a real estate venture.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.630
And during this vaguely
period in Grant's life,

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.640
Julia has a dream one night.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.380
She dreams that her
husband is going

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.740
to be president of
the United States.

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:21.150
And when she tells
her friends and family

00:09:21.150 --> 00:09:23.500
about this dream,
everyone laughs.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.520
Nothing can say more
preposterous.

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.820
This man is struggling just

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.840
to support a wife
and four children.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.680
Julia knew.

00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:33.470
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: You spent a
fair amount in the book talking

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:35.890
about Grant's struggle
with alcohol.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:37.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Mm-hmm.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:38.490
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
What did you conclude?

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:39.790
Did he have a problem
with drinking?

00:09:39.790 --> 00:09:41.600
And what sort of
evidence did you use

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.130
to draw those conclusions?

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:44.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well,
historically,

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.840
the debate about Grant
has always been, you know,

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.420
was he a drunkard or not?

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.190
And I always found just the
term drunkard is such a kind

00:09:50.190 --> 00:09:54.320
of loaded, moralistic term,
because it implies that a person

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.580
who was dissipated and
irresponsible and who's kind

00:09:57.580 --> 00:10:00.630
of gleefully indulging
this vice.

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:03.780
And I felt that I
tried to approach it

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:06.620
through what I hope is a
more enlightened attitude.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.400
He was an alcoholic.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.080
I say that because he could
never have just one drink.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.560
I say that because
even one glass

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.730
of alcohol changed
his personality.

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.270
But this was something
that he struggled

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:20.200
against his entire life.

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.060
He was already a member
of the Temperance Lodge

00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:23.960
when he was in his 20s.

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:25.890
The reason I think there's
been so much difficulty

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.950
that previous writers had
with Grant's drinking is

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:30.970
that he was a binge drinker.

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:34.180
He was an episodic drinker,
so that he could go for two

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.810
or three months without
touching a glass of alcohol.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.280
He would then have two or three
day benders that even people

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.600
who are close to him but would
not actually see him during

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.550
those sprees as they were cold.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.600
And so-- But it's a problem
that he struggles with,

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.470
and by the time he
becomes president,

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:52.890
he's largely conquered it.

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.190
But it certainly is a problem

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.050
that bedevils him
throughout the Civil War.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:10:59.350
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Right, and that causes him

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.650
to leave the military,

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.360
precipitates an exit
from the military?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yes.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:04.960
In 1854, he was assigned
to a couple

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.790
of very lonely bleak garrisons
in Oregon, Northern California

00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:11.760
where he could not afford to
bring his wife and children.

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.060
He was lonely.

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.360
He was depressed.

00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:15.660
He starts drinking.

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.890
And then in 1854, he shows up
one day to pay table drunk,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.580
and is really drummed out
of the surface-- service.

00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:24.900
It was very significant because
the peacetime army was really

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:26.200
very small.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.580
And so, there was a
very active rumor mills.

00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:31.730
So, all of the stories
of Grant's history

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:34.150
of drinking will follow
him into the Civil War,

00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:38.210
and will very much kind of
color how people see him.

00:11:38.210 --> 00:11:41.480
I think that probably were it
not for that history and all

00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:43.700
of these stories about
Grant's drinking,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.930
Abraham Lincoln might well have
brought Grant east much sooner

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.880
in the war to act
as general-in-chief.

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.480
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
So Grant is civilian

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.460
and you have a very
poignant description of him.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.520
He ends up on the streets of
St. Louis selling firewood

00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.820
to support his family.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.120
How does that happen?

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.420
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:03.720
OK, tried making it as a farmer.

00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.370
Julia has a wedding
gift from her father,

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.890
received 60 acres
which Grant worked.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:11.750
He was very industrious but
he could not make a go of it.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:17.190
So he ends up taking firewood
10 miles into St. Louis

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.650
and he actually walks
beside the wagon.

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.460
People who saw him in
those days selling firewood

00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.580
on street corners in St. Louis
said that he was bearded,

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.360
disheveled, unkempt looking.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.500
In fact, one of his old
army buddies ran into him

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.970
on the street and
was really shocked

00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:36.070
by Grant's unkempt appearance.

00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:38.270
And he said to him,
"Grant, what are you doing?"

00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:40.900
Grant's response was
very poignant, he said,

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.620
"I'm solving the
problem of poverty."

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:46.510
He was so poor at that-- yeah,
he was so poor at that point

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:51.190
that one Christmas, he
had to pawn his watch

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:54.950
to buy a Christmas
presents for his family.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.410
This was Circa 1857.

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.240
Civil War breaks out 1861.

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.390
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Then
something happens, Fort Sumter.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.000
And you write in your book,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.760
Grant eventually joins the
volunteer infantry in Illinois

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:08.830
and then gets a position
in the Union Army.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:12.250
And you write in your book
that a change overcomes Grant.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.550
What was that change?

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:15.370
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well, you
know, the Civil War broke out,

00:13:15.370 --> 00:13:17.080
there was a desperate
shortage of officers.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.040
You have to remember
about a third

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.790
of the army officers
were from the South.

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:25.270
So many of them, most of them
defected to the confederacy.

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:28.140
So there was a crying
need for trained people.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:30.240
Grant still had all of that war

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.060
from West Point story
in his mind.

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.490
He had fought with great
distinction in the Mexican War,

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:40.480
had been assigned to four
different frontier garrisons

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.530
before the Civil War.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:47.730
And so, his efficiency and his
military knowledge immediately

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.030
come to the fore.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.530
And so, Grant's rise gives new
meaning to the term meteoric.

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:59.660
Two months after the outbreak of
the Civil War, he's a colonel.

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.890
Four months after, he's
a brigadier general.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.190
Twelve months after the outbreak

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.810
of the Civil War,
he's a major general.

00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:10.610
And by the end of the Civil War,
this man who had been working

00:14:10.610 --> 00:14:13.640
as a clerk in his father's
leather goods store in Galena,

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:16.860
Illinois back in 1860,
that man who had seem

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:20.700
like a certifiable failure
in life was general-in-chief

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:23.140
of the Union Army with
one million soldiers

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.430
under his command far and
away the largest military

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:29.800
establishment in the country
up until at that time.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.390
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Now, he
had some early victories

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:33.430
that catches the eye of
Lincoln, is that right?

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:34.730
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah,
absolutely.

00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:36.640
You know, very often, the
history of the Civil War,

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.940
there's kind

00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:39.670
of a disproportionate
focus on Virginia.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:40.970
And if you look at Virginia,

00:14:40.970 --> 00:14:43.530
it seems like the confederacy
is winning battle after battle.

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.800
If you look at what was
happening in the western theater

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:49.430
of war, Grant was winning
one victory after another.

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:52.420
And in early, 1862, he
has kind of twin battles

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:55.330
against Twin Forts all the
way in the northwest corner

00:14:55.330 --> 00:14:59.870
of Tennessee, Forts
Henry and Donelson.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.010
They were significant
for the following reason.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:06.790
Fort Henry was on the Tennessee
River, Fort Cumberland on the--

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:09.120
sorry, Fort Donelson on
the Cumberland River.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.420
And those two rivers penetrated
deep into the confederacy,

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:16.900
particularly Grant's victory
at Fort Donelson was the first

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:20.010
of three times that he captured
an entire confederate army,

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:22.170
it's more than 13,000 people.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:24.460
It also led to a new
nickname for Grant

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:28.150
because the confederate general
inside the fort was Simon

00:15:28.150 --> 00:15:31.410
Buckner, who wanted to
send the message to Grant

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:34.610
that he wanted commissioner's
appointed to negotiate a truce.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:38.760
And Grant wrote back, you know,
no terms except unconditional

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.010
and immediate surrender
will be accepted.

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:44.130
I proposed to move upon
your works immediately.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:47.200
That unconditional surrender
line, it became instead

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.600
of US-Grant, it became
unconditional surrender Grant.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.230
It was really kind of the
first large scale of victory

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:56.220
of the war for the north.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.680
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: In late 1862,

00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.580
he issues general
order number 11--

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:01.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.180
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: --

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:04.580
which expels the Jews from his
military district in the South

00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.860
because he believes
that they are engaged

00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:10.140
in a illegal black-market
cotton ring.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.440
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: That's
right, yeah.

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.380
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: And was Grant
anti-semitic or did he regret

00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:14.680
that decision later on?

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:15.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: No.

00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:17.760
I mean he regretted it almost
as soon as he issued it.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.470
As soon as Lincoln and secretary
of war Edwin Stanton saw it,

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.530
they immediately overrode it.

00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:26.270
Grant said that he did
regret it almost instantly.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:29.530
It was an atrocious and
inexcusable thing to do.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.910
People know that piece
of the story, you know.

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.460
What they don't know
is Grant spent the rest

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.410
of his life atoning
for that action.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.940
As president, he appointed
more Jews to public office

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:42.900
and all the other 19th
century presidents combined.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.270
He became the first
president to speak

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:47.400
out on human rights
abuses abroad.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.850
And in both cases, it was
because of persecution

00:16:49.850 --> 00:16:53.460
of the Jews, one time in
Russia, one time in Poland.

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.880
And most of remarkable of
all since he was sitting here

00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:01.080
in Washington, D.C., during the
last year of his second term,

00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:02.910
he was invited to the dedication

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.940
of the synagogue called Adas
Israel, a very tiny synagogue.

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:10.500
Grant went with his son
and with a US senator.

00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:11.840
It was a three-hour ceremony.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.740
Here is president of
the United States,

00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:18.470
this was a congregation
probably had 40 or 50 people.

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:22.440
One hour into the
dedication of this synagogue,

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:25.290
the elders of this synagogue
went over to Grant and said,

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:27.360
"Mr. President, we're very
touched that you would come

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.340
to this, you know,
humble function.

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.290
You can leave now
in good conscience."

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.960
Grant insisted on staying
the full three hours,

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.820
reached into his pocket, gave
a donation to the synagogue.

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:42.110
He was not-- It was kind of one

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.430
of the pleasurable
things writing about him.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:45.730
He was not a prejudiced man.

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.460
He was not a man, you know,
full of hatred, you know.

00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:50.980
You could read-- I don't know,
say William Tecumseh Sherman,

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:55.430
his statements on, you know,
blacks or Native Americans kind

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:57.200
of hair-raising,
ferocious things.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.270
You don't see that in
Grant's papers at all.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:02.060
So this was something that was
really very out of character

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:05.240
for him and luckily he
apologized and atoned

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.540
for it the rest of his life.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.980
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: He has a
number of other successes.

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.290
He has more manpower at
this time, more resources,

00:18:12.290 --> 00:18:15.690
and then he has the
victory at Vicksburg.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:17.890
Why is Vicksburg so impressive?

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:21.090
And why it was really
a daring capture?

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:22.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah, well,
it happened, you know,

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:24.550
in New Orleans, Baton Rouge

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.750
and Memphis had fallen
to Union forces.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:31.110
And it meant that the one great
citadel, the one great bastion

00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:34.480
on the Mississippi River left to
the confederacy was Vicksburg.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.790
Vicksburg was located-- at
that time, there was a bend

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.630
in the Mississippi there that
forced folks to slow down.

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:45.290
There was seven miles of
very elaborate fortification.

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:48.420
So it really seemed like
this impregnable fortress.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:53.340
Grant had really very daring
strategy to take Vicksburg.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:57.840
Under cover of night, he had
ironclads and transports come

00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:01.540
down the river despite heavy
shelling from the confederates.

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.840
He also marched some troops

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.930
down the western bank
of the Mississippi.

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:08.820
They then crossed over
south of Vicksburg

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:12.760
to the only high dry land
in that area, and then kind

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.020
of Grant has this
lightning campaign.

00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:19.230
He wins five major victories
in a three-week period,

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:24.340
surrounds Vicksburg, lay siege
to it and Vicksburg surrenders.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.640
It was the same time as
the victory at Gettysburg.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:32.500
And for a second time, Grant has
captured an entire confederate

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.050
army of more than
30,000 soldiers.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.850
And so at that point, the
Union not only controlled the

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:45.030
Mississippi but it bisected
the confederacy because a lot

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.340
of the supplies, particularly
horses and livestock,

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.560
came from west of
the Mississippi.

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:51.610
So the confederate army
was suddenly cut off

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.450
from this major source

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:55.240
of supplies west
of the Mississippi.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.730
And that was Grant.

00:19:56.730 --> 00:19:58.830
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: When did
President Lincoln bring Grant

00:19:58.830 --> 00:20:01.510
east to lead the Union army?

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:03.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well, what
happens in February 1864,

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:08.250
Congress passes a bill
reinstating the tittle

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:09.550
of lieutenant general.

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.960
The only one who had ever held
that was George Washington.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.980
Winfield Scott had kind of
brevet lieutenant general.

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:18.250
And Grant becomes that
lieutenant general.

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:21.140
It's a wonderful story
because in March 1864,

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:23.920
he comes to Washington,
although Lincoln loved Grant,

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:26.480
he'd never actually
set eyes on him before.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.080
Grant happened to
arrive at the same day

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.560
that Lincoln was
having reception

00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.060
at the White House
in the Blue Room.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:36.090
And Grant goes in.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:37.930
Lincoln warmly embraces him.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.470
And there were such pandemonium
in the room because Grant was

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.140
such a hero, that they urged
Grant to stand up on a sofa

00:20:45.140 --> 00:20:48.090
so that people could see him
because he was relatively short.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.820
He stands up on the sofa.

00:20:50.820 --> 00:20:55.380
He's perspiring profusely so
that people could see him.

00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:58.260
And Grant was always a
little socially awkward.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.680
And Grant later said that the
hottest campaign he ever fought

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:05.770
was standing on that sofa
[laughter] in the White House.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.910
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So Grant was
impressive on a tactical level?

00:21:08.910 --> 00:21:10.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:11.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: On
an operational level.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:12.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:21:12.810 --> 00:21:14.110
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: And
on a strategic level.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:15.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:21:15.410 --> 00:21:16.710
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: How rare was

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:18.010
that to find all three
qualities in a general?

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:19.680
And how that he compare to
Robert E. Lee in that regard?

00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well, Sherman
had a very interesting comment

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:25.220
where he was comparing
a Grant and Lee.

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:28.580
He said that Grant's
strategy embraced a continent.

00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:31.400
Lee's strategy embraced
a state, Virginia.

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:35.750
That is Grant in a way
had the harder task.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:40.170
Lee just had to inflict so
much pain on Union forces

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.050
that the northern
public would weary

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.880
and decide to give up the war.

00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:45.440
Grant actually had to capture

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.110
and destroy Robert
E. Lee's army,

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.370
and he really had
a strategic vision

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.380
because the various Union
armies in different theaters

00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.610
of war had been operating
independently of each other.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:01.630
Grant coordinated their
movements so that they--

00:22:01.630 --> 00:22:05.610
he turned them into a
single fighting force.

00:22:05.610 --> 00:22:08.720
And he saw that the way to
wear down the confederacy is

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.430
by having Union forces
simultaneously attack different

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:14.280
confederate army so
that they could not kind

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.230
of switch reinforcements
from one to another.

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.820
And he finally pins
Robert E. Lee

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.480
down in Richmond in Petersburg.

00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.040
And there's another wonderful
comment from Sherman.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.170
Sherman said about
Grant, he said,

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.760
"Robert E. Lee would
attack the front porch."

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:35.270
He said, "Ulysses S. Grant would
attack the bedroom and kitchen."

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.300
I'm not sure what he meant
about the bedroom, I don't what

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.230
to go there [laughter].

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:41.450
But in terms of attacking
the kitchen,

00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:43.870
that again this goes back
to Grant, a quartermaster,

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.580
what he did with
Lee in Richmond,

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:48.030
Petersburg is he
began systematically

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.060
to cut off every railway
line and every canal

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.810
that was feeding
supplies to Lee's army.

00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.850
Finally starving it
out and forcing him

00:22:55.850 --> 00:23:00.250
to flee West Appomattox
Courthouse where Grant

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:05.460
and Sherman overtake Lee's
army and forced its surrender.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:08.740
And that was then the
third confederate army

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.040
that Grant captured.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:12.480
Robert E. Lee never
captured a single Union army.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.780
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: How
does Grant conduct himself

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:15.320
at Appomattox?

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Oh, it's the
most touching part of the story

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:22.970
because he refuses to allow his
soldiers to gloat or celebrate.

00:23:22.970 --> 00:23:24.460
He is very generous.

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.970
These confederate soldiers
literally are starving.

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.860
He issues rations to feed them.

00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.530
He allows the confederate
officers

00:23:31.530 --> 00:23:33.140
to keep their horses
and firearms.

00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:35.530
And really I think the
most beautiful passage

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:39.600
in Grant's memoirs are-- is
about the meeting at Appomattox

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:43.710
because Grant said
that he was sad

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.130
and depressed when he met Lee.

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:51.330
And he writes, "I felt like
anything rather than rejoicing

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:56.950
over the downfall of a foe, who
would fought with such valor

00:23:56.950 --> 00:24:00.220
and suffered such
hardship for a cause,

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:05.090
although that cause was the
worst that any, you know,

00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:06.550
army could have fought for."

00:24:06.550 --> 00:24:08.010
And I think it's a
beautiful statement.

00:24:08.010 --> 00:24:10.680
Particularly, we've had
a prolonged discussion

00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.050
about the confederate monuments.

00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:13.830
And I think Grant in
a way shoves the way

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:17.480
because on the one hand
in that passage, he play--

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.090
he pays homage to the bravery
of the confederate soldiers.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.390
And they were brave.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.810
They were quite extraordinary
in many, many battles.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.930
At the same time, the cause
for which they were fighting,

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:31.000
the perpetuation of
slavery was, as Grant says,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.020
one of the worst causes
that people fight for.

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.380
So I think that the humanity and
also the fairness and balance

00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.750
that he brought to that
subject I think is really one

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:42.100
that should stay with us.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.690
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Grant does
not accept President Lincoln's

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:48.090
invitation to attend
Ford's Theatre.

00:24:48.090 --> 00:24:50.500
Would history perhaps
unfolded differently

00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:51.800
if Grant had been there?

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah,
it's quite a story.

00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:56.510
Because what happened in
late March 1864, Abraham

00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:58.160
and Mary Lincoln go
down to City Point,

00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.130
Virginia where Grant
has his headquarters.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.980
Mary Lincoln, who was
showing increasing signs

00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:11.240
of mental instability, Mary
Lincoln throws a jealous fit.

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.040
She imagines that the young wife

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.430
of General Edward O. C. Ord
is flirting with her husband.

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.600
And she starts to berate young
Mrs. Ord, who can't figure

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.990
out what's going on
and bursts into tears.

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:25.990
And Julia Grant was there.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:31.850
Julia Grant intervenes to try
to protect young Mrs. Ord.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.560
And we all know what
happens when you try

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.730
to intervene of the fight.

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:40.960
Then Mary Lincoln turned on
Julia Grant and turned on her

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:45.210
so angrily that the night
that the Lincoln's went

00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:48.090
to Ford Theatre, Lincoln
thought it was very important

00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.680
that the public see the
victorious president

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.430
and the victorious
general at the same time.

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.040
Julia Grant, you know, lay
down the law to her husband,

00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.870
she said, "I refused
to go to Ford's Theatre

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:00.320
if Mary Lincoln is
going to be there."

00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:02.520
So they made their,
you know, excuses.

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.160
They went off to Burlington, New
Jersey where they had a house.

00:26:06.160 --> 00:26:09.920
So one of the great
what ifs of history,

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.540
if Ulysses S. Grant had been
in that box at Ford's Theatre

00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.580
with Lincoln, would he have
had a security detail there?

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:23.070
With his military instincts,
he have sensed, you know,

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:24.640
the assassin entering the box,

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.140
or of course it's
entirely possibly

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:30.400
that both would have killed
Grant as well as Lincoln.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.090
We'll never know.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.530
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: How did Grant
manage to win the nomination,

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:37.370
the Republican nomination
in 1868?

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.940
Had he had showed an aptitude
for politics previously?

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:42.240
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: No, not really.

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.180
In fact, there was kind of a
great guessing game that went

00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:48.650
on in terms of what Grant's
party affiliation was.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:51.930
Came from, you know, Whig
family, whose only vote had been

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:55.140
for James Buchanan
of-- for president.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:57.870
Really no one knew
exactly where he stood.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.360
He was in the right
place at the right time.

00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:04.470
You know, since Appomattox, he
had a certain symbolic standing

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:07.300
in American life as
the victor of the war

00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:11.540
and also reconciliation
between North and South.

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:16.060
And what happened in 1868,
there was a failed attempt.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.090
They did impeach President
John Henry Johnson.

00:27:20.090 --> 00:27:23.120
He's not convicted,
lost by a single vote

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:25.920
which weakened the radical
Republicans in Congress.

00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:30.190
Grant kind of was in a position
to straddle both of the wings

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.400
of the Republican Party,
still had this kind

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:36.890
of immense prestige
from the war.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.590
And he did not campaign
openly for it.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:44.180
Grant had a funny kind of way
of not campaigning for things

00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:46.360
but sort of putting
him in a position

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.110
where things just
happened to him.

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.360
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: In
his first term of office,

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.450
the 15th Amendment is
enacted and ratified

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:58.500
and there's a backlash in the
South, violence escalates.

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:01.100
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: And
there's strengthening

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.400
of the Ku Klux Klan.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.700
You spent a lot of
time in the book

00:28:03.700 --> 00:28:05.620
and you handled it very deftly.

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.690
What did Grant do to combat
the Klan and was he successful?

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.990
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:12.940
The Klan starts in
Pulaski, Tennessee, 1866.

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:17.160
It starts out as a social
club of confederate veterans.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.030
And they start, you know,
wearing their old uniforms

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:23.840
and drilling and it
becomes a militaristic

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.280
secret organization.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.320
And then of course they
started putting on, you know,

00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:29.640
robes and hoods at
night on horseback

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.940
and terrorizing people.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.240
This was, you're
absolutely right,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.720
prompted by the 15th Amendment.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:37.840
Nothing terrified the white
south more than the black men

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:40.550
and it was only black
men voting.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:43.340
And so, the terror was
right much directed

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.430
against blacks voting
or registering to vote.

00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:49.070
There was no southern sheriff

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:51.570
who would arrest the
member of the Klan.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.230
There was no southern jury

00:28:53.230 --> 00:28:54.740
that would convict the
member of the Klan.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.510
There was no southern white who
would testify against the Klan.

00:28:57.510 --> 00:29:00.730
So there'd been-- there were
hundreds, maybe thousands

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:04.950
of murders of blacks
that went unprosecuted.

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:10.260
Grant had a very crusading
attorney general named Amos

00:29:10.260 --> 00:29:12.180
Akerman from Georgia.

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:17.640
Akerman brought 3000
indictments, and got more

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.750
than a thousand convictions
against the Klan

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.270
and crashed the Ku Klux Klan.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.740
I mean, it was his greatest
achievement as president.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:29.540
The Klan that we know is really
from the resurgence of the Klan

00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.160
from the 1910s and 1920s,
that Klan that has less to do

00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:39.080
with us, and they of course
borrowed a lot of the techniques

00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.660
and ideology of the
original Klan.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.960
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Why were there

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.260
so many corruption-related
scandals

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.590
in Grant's two terms of office?

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:47.990
Did he-- Was he complicit?

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:49.400
Did he turned a blind eye,

00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.850
or was he just oblivious
to what was going on?

00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:53.970
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Grant
was incredibly naive.

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:56.390
I'll tell a story from his
childhood if it makes the point,

00:29:56.390 --> 00:29:59.070
unfortunately it
didn't get much better.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:03.080
But he-- when he was a boy, his
father wanted to buy a horse,

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:06.220
so he told Ulysses
to go to this farmer

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.620
and he gave Ulysses
his instructions.

00:30:09.620 --> 00:30:11.830
He said, "Offer $20
to the farmer.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.580
If he doesn't take it,
then offer him 22.50.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.810
And if he still doesn't,
you know, bite, offer 25."

00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:20.800
So Grant goes to the
farmer and he says,

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:23.090
"My father said I should
offer you $20 for the horse

00:30:23.090 --> 00:30:25.990
but if you don't take it
[laughter], to offer you 22.50,

00:30:25.990 --> 00:30:28.680
and if you don't take
that to offer you $25."

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.490
Well, I wish I could say there
was some learning curve in terms

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:34.880
of Grant and money,
but there wasn't.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:38.800
And, you know, unscrupulous
people seemed

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.050
to spot Grant a mile away.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.960
In fact, during his
second term in office,

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:46.510
the so-called Whiskey
Ring scandal,

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:48.960
the brewers were
evading this tax

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.670
by paying off revenue agents.

00:30:51.670 --> 00:30:53.310
Among the people who
was very involved

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:55.580
in it was Grant's
newly chief-of-staff,

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.940
a man named Orville Babcock

00:30:57.940 --> 00:31:01.770
And when Babcock is
being investigated,

00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:04.550
Grant writes a letter to
Babcock's wife saying,

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:08.680
"I have full faith in
your husband's integrity."

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.540
He said "I've had the
most, you know, intimate

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:15.220
and confidential relations with
your husband for 14 years."

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:17.950
And he says, "I can't believe

00:31:17.950 --> 00:31:22.340
that he's not the trustworthy
person that I imagined."

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.640
Guess what?

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.940
He was, and since that he was
kind of like chief-of-staff,

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.270
he had the desk right outside
Grant's office reviewed incoming

00:31:30.270 --> 00:31:35.340
and outgoing mail
and Grant fired him.

00:31:35.340 --> 00:31:39.140
Well, he assigned him, he
became inspector of lighthouses

00:31:39.140 --> 00:31:41.960
on the Florida coast [laughter].

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.260
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: So
after he leaves office,

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.470
Grant coast on a trip around
the world with his wife

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:46.770
for two and a half years.

00:31:46.770 --> 00:31:48.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:49.420
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: How was
he received in this strip?

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: It's kind

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:52.020
of a post-presidency
unlike any other.

00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:54.670
During that, you know, almost
two and a half year period,

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:57.800
he meets with virtually every
head of state in the world,

00:31:57.800 --> 00:32:02.960
Queen Victoria receives him
at Windsor Castle, Prince--

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.810
and Bismarck receives
him in Berlin,

00:32:05.810 --> 00:32:11.560
the pope at the Vatican Czar
Alexander II in St. Petersburg.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.530
And then he goes
to the Far East,

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.690
and the crowds are
immense, like 250,000 people

00:32:16.690 --> 00:32:19.930
at that time would turn out.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.660
And even, you know, the Emperor

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:26.480
of Japan would never
actually touched people.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.020
When he saw Grant, he stepped
forward and shook hands

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.890
with Grant which was unheard of.

00:32:30.890 --> 00:32:36.860
And Grant actually pioneers a
certain post-presidential role

00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:38.670
that would be followed
by other presidents

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:45.540
that he arbitrates a dispute
over postwar-- offshore islands,

00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:48.740
yeah, between Japan
and China, you know.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:50.530
So he comes back
with really this sort

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:54.680
of great reputation
very much enhanced.

00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.370
He's become a statesman
on the world stage.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.690
It's amazing.

00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.100
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: After trying
to get the nomination again

00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:06.810
in 1880, not winning it, he
decides to move to New York City

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:08.860
and try his hand in
the investment world.

00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.220
How does that turned out?

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:11.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well,
again money,

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:13.120
disastrously, you
know [laughter].

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.450
Question answers itself.

00:33:15.450 --> 00:33:19.820
He formed a partnership with a
young man named Ferdinand Ward,

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.230
who was 29 years
old who was lionized

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.050
as the Young Napoleon
of Finance.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:27.310
They created a partnership
called Grant and Ward.

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.300
It was the only time Grant
ever allowed his name

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.600
to be used in business.

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.120
And of course Grant's name
attracted a lot of money.

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.340
Alas for those of you
who don't know the story,

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.150
Ferdinand Ward was the
Bernie Madoff of today.

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.190
It was a Ponzi scheme.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:44.220
He was using money
from new investors

00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:48.440
to pay outrageous rates of
interests to the old investors.

00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:51.720
And so poor Grant, with
this incurable naivety,

00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.430
Grant imagines that
he's a multimillionaire.

00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:57.870
And he wakes up one day
to find out that instead

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:00.910
of being multimillionaire,
he's worth $80

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:03.790
and Julia is worth a $130.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.850
That not only had
Grant's fortune,

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:11.440
well he lost his fortune, have
been wiped out but, you know,

00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.160
all of his children had
invested with Madoff.

00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:16.810
He had a lot of cousins,
he had a lot of friends.

00:34:16.810 --> 00:34:21.940
So the entire Grant family was
engulfed in this catastrophe.

00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:25.400
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: In
1884, Grant falls ill.

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.090
What was wrong with him and what
was the prescribed treatment?

00:34:28.090 --> 00:34:29.390
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Right
now, this--

00:34:29.390 --> 00:34:34.000
the illness really
coincides with the exposure

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.010
of the problem with
Ferdinand Ward.

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:43.130
Grant one day-- They had a house
in Long Branch, New Jersey.

00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.700
Julia serves him a plate of
delicious peaches and he bites

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:50.040
into one of the peaches
and says, "Ouch,

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.500
that peach stung me
for some reason."

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.590
And it was the first time he
realized there was a problem

00:34:55.590 --> 00:34:57.060
with his throat.

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:01.470
He finally, with some delay,
consulted his doctor in New York

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:06.580
who found a cancerous mass
on his throat and tongue.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.180
It was incurable.

00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:14.040
And so, Grant realized that
this was a terminal illness

00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:17.200
and he was petrified that not--

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.360
if really when he died that
Julia wouldn't be left destitute

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.830
because they'd lost
all their money.

00:35:22.830 --> 00:35:24.670
So he decided to do something

00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.540
that he swore he wouldn't
do, he wrote his memoirs.

00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.990
So during the last year of
his life in excruciating pain,

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:34.700
and with his mind often
fogged by the opiates,

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.990
he managed to write a memoir

00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:40.980
that is considered the greatest
military memoir probably

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.280
in English language.

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.970
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
He wrote 10,000 words

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:45.800
in a day while he
had throat cancer.

00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:47.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.400
And his publisher
was Mark Twain.

00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.750
And one wonderful
letter, you know,

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:51.190
Mark Twain writes to somebody.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:53.020
he said, "Grant wrote
10,000 words today."

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.650
He said, "It kills me these days

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:57.320
to even write 5000
words in it in a day.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:35:59.650
He couldn't believe
Grant's productivity,

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:02.700
and this memoir really
poured out of him.

00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.770
And many people imagined
that Twain wrote the memoirs.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:08.950
Twain wrote, the
style is flawless,

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:11.470
no man can improve upon them.

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:13.440
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Why is
Grant buried in New York City

00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:15.260
and what was his funeral like?

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.530
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah,
because the last few years

00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.890
of their lives, Ulysses
and Julia Grant were living

00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:23.260
on East 66th Street
in Manhattan.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:25.750
His funeral, I was just
thinking about his funeral today

00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:29.690
because of the John
McCain memorial gathering

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.680
at National Cathedral.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:36.340
When Grant was buried
in New York, and that he

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:39.140
and Julia felt very
grateful to New York.

00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.980
And the city provided
this beautiful spot

00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.330
in the new Riverside Park.

00:36:44.330 --> 00:36:49.320
Grant's funeral spoke to the
public very much in the way

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:52.550
that John McCain's memorial
services have been speaking

00:36:52.550 --> 00:36:53.850
to the public.

00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:56.710
That is, at Grant's
funeral, a million

00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:58.920
and a half people
flooded New York City.

00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:01.290
The funeral parade went
on through five hours.

00:37:01.290 --> 00:37:06.220
But Grant and his family
made a statement, so--

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.100
and it was of North-South
reconciliation.

00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:13.400
There were as among the
honorary pallbearers,

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.030
there were great Union generals
William Tecumseh Sherman

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:19.540
and Phil Sheridan, but there
also major confederate generals,

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.920
Joseph Johnston and
Simon Buckner.

00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:27.520
Again, as part of this
reconciliation theme,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.840
the Stonewall Jackson Brigade
from Staunton, Virginia, came up

00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:32.480
and marched in the parade.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.560
Black regiments marched
in the parade

00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:37.140
because Grant had been very
instrumental during the Civil

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.590
War in terms of recruiting
and training and equipping,

00:37:40.590 --> 00:37:42.430
you know, black soldiers.

00:37:42.430 --> 00:37:46.150
And so this was really
Grant's final statement

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.520
from beyond the grave.

00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.870
And I think that, you know,

00:37:48.870 --> 00:37:53.160
Grant in many ways reminds me
what people have been saying

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:59.740
about John McCain in terms of
his patriotism, his bravery,

00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:02.310
his dedication to
public service.

00:38:02.310 --> 00:38:06.040
The fact that he distinguished
himself both in civilian service

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.010
and in the military service,
and kind of reminds us

00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.530
of what old-fashioned
patriotism should look like.

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.210
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Last question
before we take some questions

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:15.510
from the audience.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:19.570
As we reconsider Grant, as you
have in this magnificent book,

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.240
what should we learn from
Grant in his leadership?

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:23.540
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well I think

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:24.890
that one reason people have
responded to the book, you know,

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:28.080
all the other people that
I've written about were seemed

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.630
to be instant successes in life.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.270
They were all sort
of built for success,

00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.000
that kind of great drive
and energy in focus.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.800
Grant didn't, and I think people
were responding to the book

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:41.590
because the highs are as high as
any story in American history,

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:43.970
but the lows are a
lot lower, you know.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:47.160
So, that this is a story of
a lot of light and shadow.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.460
It's a story about a man

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.090
who suffered repeated
failures and setbacks.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:57.280
In fact, as I was coming in to
the room, someone said to me,

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.510
"I love your Grant book
because it's the greatest story

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:00.810
about a comeback."

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.110
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Comeback [laughs].

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:03.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: And they
were repeated comebacks

00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:04.710
in Grant's life, you know.

00:39:04.710 --> 00:39:07.010
Success was kind
of a greasy pole.

00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:08.310
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Right.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:09.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: And he keeps
slipping back down the pole

00:39:09.610 --> 00:39:11.000
and then he would have to
work his way back up again.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.300
&gt;&gt;: Colleen Shogan: Terrific.

00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:14.930
If there are any
questions for Ron,

00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:21.090
we'd be happy to take a few.

00:39:21.090 --> 00:39:24.070
&gt;&gt; Hello, very good
book, loved it.

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:29.830
Just want to ask a quick
comment on Grant's relationship

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:34.180
with George Armstrong
Custer and how you describe

00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.990
that relationship in the book.

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:37.290
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: It was a very--

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.670
it was very troubled
relationship.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:44.790
And Grant was very,
very critical of Custer,

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.190
really blamed Custer for the
massacre at Little Bighorn,

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:52.550
and felt that he was really, you
know, not following orders and,

00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:57.380
you know, put himself and
his men in harm's way.

00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.570
Custer also had been
an outspoken critic

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:02.340
of Grant as president.

00:40:02.340 --> 00:40:07.310
And that's certainly helped
to fuel the animosity.

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:09.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Yes, sweetheart

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:17.160
[ Inaudible ]

00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:20.150
&gt;&gt; Yes, so I'm going
to read two questions

00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:21.450
by Becky [assumed spelling].

00:40:21.450 --> 00:40:22.750
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Sure.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.200
&gt;&gt; If Grant had gone
by his first name,

00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.960
would anything be
different [laughter]?

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:30.550
Secondly, what is happening
with the adaptation?

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.290
I know someone bought
the rights.

00:40:32.290 --> 00:40:33.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Right, yeah.

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:34.890
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Good question.

00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: OK, first,
you know, Grant's name,

00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:37.490
he was born Hiram Ulysses Grant,

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:40.840
which gave him the
unfortunate initials H-U-G

00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.220
or hug [laughter].

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.900
And he was mercilessly
teased by the other boys

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.460
so he dropped the Hiram and
became just plain Ulysses.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.190
Then when local congressmen
nominated him for West Point,

00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:56.360
he bungled the name, he sent
it in as Ulysses S. Grant.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.470
I actually found one letter
where Ulysses is writing

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.430
to Julia, who wanted to
know what the S stood for.

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.140
His own wife didn't
know what it stood for.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.090
And he wrote back his funny
letter and he says, the S stands

00:41:06.090 --> 00:41:08.280
for absolutely nothing.

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:10.590
In terms of-- yeah, the--

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:12.950
it's not going to be
hip-hop musical [laughter].

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.490
Shocks, but it will be a
future film and it's going

00:41:18.490 --> 00:41:20.760
to be directed by
Steven Spielberg

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.060
which is very exciting.

00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:23.760
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Oh, perfect.

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:26.160
[ Applause ]

00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:28.570
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: And
produced by Leonardo DiCaprio

00:41:28.570 --> 00:41:30.310
which is also exciting.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:34.180
And it looks like I'll again
be the historic old consultant.

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.480
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Yeah, that's great.

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.280
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.740
[ Applause ]

00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.320
&gt;&gt; So, you've written about
Washington and Hamilton

00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.700
and now Grant, are there
any lessons or a big lesson

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:50.770
that you've learned
through studying this

00:41:50.770 --> 00:41:53.940
that you think is worth sharing?

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: It's a
very, very good question.

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.040
You know, one strange thing
when people have asked me

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:03.640
about a common denominator
to these lives, the one thing

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:07.340
and every person that I've
written about, they had to cope

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:09.590
from an early age
with a difficult,

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.390
even impossible parent.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:12.690
I know this sounds

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:14.470
like a strange response
to your question.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:16.010
But, you know, there
was Washington

00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:17.860
with the very self-centered
mother.

00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:20.230
There was Hamilton with
the absentee father.

00:42:20.230 --> 00:42:24.750
Grant had this very domineering
and overbearing father.

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.670
And I think that there
is something about coping

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.810
with a very, very
difficult parent

00:42:28.810 --> 00:42:32.270
that I guess shapes
character and forces people

00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:35.670
to be self-reliant
at an early age.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.620
Kind of big frustration I found
with all of these books is

00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.080
that all the people I've
written about, because they had

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.630
such difficult parents,
they never talked about it.

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:47.440
And sometimes, I imagine it out
like if I could conjure them

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:49.340
to life and ask them questions.

00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:54.160
I think I'd want to zero
in on the family dynamics.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:43:02.010
&gt;&gt;Grant was partnered
with a Ponzi schemer,

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.920
did he play any part in catching
him, the Ferdinand Ward?

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:06.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: I'm sorry.

00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:07.920
I'm not sure that I
understood the question, but--

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.660
&gt;&gt; Grant was partnered with a
Ponzi schemer Ferdinand Ward,

00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.020
did he play any part
in catching him?

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:16.320
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Well,
Ferdinand--

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:17.620
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan:
Catching, mm-hmm.

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:18.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Oh,
in catching him.

00:43:18.920 --> 00:43:20.220
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Did he
catch him, helped catch him?

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: No, that he had.

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.930
You know, what happened, Grant
was inexcusably complacent

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.770
that Ferdinand Ward put all
of the securities of the firm

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:29.830
in their safe which only
Ferdinand Ward had access.

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:32.040
Grant should never
have allowed that.

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.780
Ferdinand Ward would even
put letters, you know,

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.470
signed by Grant in front of
Grant and Grant would sign them

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.560
without reading the letter.

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:40.860
Grant felt because
there were a lot

00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:46.450
of sophisticated Wall Street
people who were investing

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.740
with Ward that he was
absolutely certain, you know,

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.060
that Ward must be sound.

00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:54.270
He should have been suspicious
because some of the people

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:58.500
who were getting like 15,
20% per month, you know.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:01.850
Boy, if that doesn't raise, you
know, warning flags right then,

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.970
but I wish that I could tell
you that Grant had been part

00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:09.570
of exposing Ward, but was not.

00:44:09.570 --> 00:44:11.370
What happened was that the bank

00:44:11.370 --> 00:44:14.800
that was lending
Ward money went bust

00:44:14.800 --> 00:44:16.360
and then the whole
scheme blew up.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.100
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: We have
time for one more question.

00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.230
&gt;&gt; Hi. Someone whose legacy
has been unjustly tarnished,

00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:25.190
what has it been like to
write this overdo exculpation

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.490
of Grant?

00:44:26.490 --> 00:44:27.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Chernow: Yeah.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:29.090
It's been, you know, very,

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:30.850
very nice because when I
published the book on Grant,

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:33.260
I felt that, you know, he
was suffering from this image

00:44:33.260 --> 00:44:35.620
that he was just this
crude, brutal butcher

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:39.980
and that was why he was
a successful general.

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:44.280
And in fact, you know, there
were six Union generals

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.990
who fought against
Robert E. Lee before Grant

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:49.420
with the same advantage and
the manpower and material.

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.610
They could not defeat
Lee, Grant could.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:54.930
I felt that Grant's
presidency had been portrayed

00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:56.710
as a failed presidency.

00:44:56.710 --> 00:44:58.170
And I think that in many ways,

00:44:58.170 --> 00:45:00.220
he was a very successful
presidency in terms

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.890
of protecting the
African-American community

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:04.350
in the South.

00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:07.540
To the extent of the book, you
know, how the revision is spent,

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:10.740
I thought there would be more
resistance and yet people kind

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:13.990
of accepted the portrait
of Grant more readily

00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:15.730
than I thought would happen.

00:45:15.730 --> 00:45:19.490
So I'm happy for that although
I was little surprised.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.510
&gt;&gt; Colleen Shogan: Please join
me in thanking Mr. Ron Chernow.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:25.350
