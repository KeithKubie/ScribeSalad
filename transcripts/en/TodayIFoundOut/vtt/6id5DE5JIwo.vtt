00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.540
Why Do Lobsters Turn Red When Cooked?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.230
Typically, the exoskeleton of most crustaceans
has a blue-green to grayish color and sometimes

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.660
they appear a brown or olive green, with just
a hint of red; with a few exceptions like

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.140
the blue and yellow lobsters and crabs.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.429
The exoskeletons of such creatures are made
up of several pigments, one of which is a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.080
carotenoid called astaxanthin, which provides
its reddish coloring (astaxanthin is the same

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.110
carotene that gives salmon its color).

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.770
At normal temperatures and when alive (in
other words, when we’re not dumping them

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.579
in boiling water or grilling the poor guys),
the astaxanthin pigments are hidden because

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.120
they are covered with other protein chains
that give their shells the bluish-gray or

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.880
brownish-green color we see.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.199
Exposure to heat destroys this protein coating,while
the carotenoid pigment, astaxanthin still

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:58.219
remains stable.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.489
So when you cook a crab or lobster or its
other tasty crustacean friends for that scrumptious

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.510
meal you forgot to invite me for 🙂 , the
heat breaks down all the pigments except for

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.280
astaxanthin; thus, causing the bright red
color we see in cooked lobsters, crabs, and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.350
crayfish or the reddish-orange color of cooked
shrimp.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.680
Now you might be wondering, “What about
the very rare, 1 in 2 million blue lobster?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.520
Does it turn red when cooked?”

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.520
YES!

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.890
Even the exceptionally rare 1 in 30 million
yellow lobster turns red.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.950
Only the albino crab and lobster do not turn
red when cooked.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.060
For the obvious reason that they have no pigmentation
and therefore, remain the same color even

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:46.789
when cooked, white.
