in the sun shoveling the dirt for five
 

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:21.920
in the sun shoveling the dirt for five
hours or the risks there's that there's

Marshall about oral history where you

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:08.810
Marshall about oral history where you
 

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.910
Marshall about oral history where you
give a presentation at the cusp and as

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:12.920
give a presentation at the cusp and as
 

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.829
give a presentation at the cusp and as
she talked about you know the power of

00:11:14.829 --> 00:11:14.839
she talked about you know the power of
 

00:11:14.839 --> 00:11:22.120
she talked about you know the power of
the methods and and and and how it's it

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:22.130
the methods and and and and how it's it
 

00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:24.519
the methods and and and and how it's it
and I realize how it could be an

00:11:24.519 --> 00:11:24.529
and I realize how it could be an
 

00:11:24.529 --> 00:11:27.370
and I realize how it could be an
immediate solution to what I was trying

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:27.380
immediate solution to what I was trying
 

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:31.420
immediate solution to what I was trying
to do to spread his story to get a story

to do to spread his story to get a story
 

00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:33.910
to do to spread his story to get a story
out but also a long-term solution to

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920
out but also a long-term solution to
 

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.460
out but also a long-term solution to
make sure that his story is recorded and

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:36.470
make sure that his story is recorded and
 

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:40.060

the history of education but just to
 

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.860
the history of education but just to
people down the line who will be curious

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:47.870
people down the line who will be curious
 

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.780
people down the line who will be curious
about how people how these guys went

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:49.790
about how people how these guys went
 

00:11:49.790 --> 00:11:52.300

about leading the schools and there's
such difficult circumstances so when I

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.010
such difficult circumstances so when I
 

00:11:55.010 --> 00:11:56.949
such difficult circumstances so when I
listen to a lecture by Mary Marshall I

00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959
listen to a lecture by Mary Marshall I
 

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:58.750
listen to a lecture by Mary Marshall I
realized that oral history could be

00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760
realized that oral history could be
 

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.199
realized that oral history could be
useful to me as a method and when I say

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:02.209
useful to me as a method and when I say

sitting down for the interview you you

00:23:43.919 --> 00:23:43.929
sitting down for the interview you you
 

00:23:43.929 --> 00:23:45.419
sitting down for the interview you you
look up background information on the

00:23:45.419 --> 00:23:45.429
look up background information on the
 

00:23:45.429 --> 00:23:47.220
look up background information on the
individual you read articles written

00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:47.230

about them you know you you try to try
 

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:51.390
about them you know you you try to try
to learn as much as possible before you

00:23:51.390 --> 00:23:51.400
to learn as much as possible before you
 

00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.430
to learn as much as possible before you
sit down so you have good questions you

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440
sit down so you have good questions you
 

00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.230

could you know generate as much detail
 

00:23:56.830 --> 00:23:59.820
could you know generate as much detail
as possible but it's difficult with the

00:23:59.820 --> 00:23:59.830
as possible but it's difficult with the
 

00:23:59.830 --> 00:24:01.289
as possible but it's difficult with the
teachers because there's nothing written

about them how are we going to do that
background research if you know if

00:24:04.919 --> 00:24:04.929
background research if you know if
 

00:24:04.929 --> 00:24:08.029
background research if you know if
they're just ordinary citizens teachers

00:24:08.029 --> 00:24:08.039
