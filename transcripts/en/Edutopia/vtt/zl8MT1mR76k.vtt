&gt;&gt;David: The essence of King Middle
School is giving kids, all kids,

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:18.256
a very purposeful way of engaging
in complex ideas, concepts,

00:00:18.556 --> 00:00:20.876
challenges and curriculum.

00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:24.326
It's about taking curriculum,
which is often so dry --

00:00:24.646 --> 00:00:27.866
it's about taking it and finding how
that actually fits into the context

00:00:27.866 --> 00:00:31.996
of the real world, giving kids
opportunities to work with people

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:34.676
who actually work in real
disciplines in the world,

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:39.576
not just academic disciplines
but work in applied science

00:00:39.576 --> 00:00:45.586
or in applied art or in applied
design, and creating a context

00:00:45.586 --> 00:00:49.666
in which they can explore that while
they build both meaningful skill sets

00:00:50.126 --> 00:00:53.946
and develop -- they develop
accurate comprehension of curriculum,

00:00:54.296 --> 00:00:56.816
but they're doing it all within
the context of real work.

00:00:56.816 --> 00:01:02.326
It's a tricky model, because it
means that in order to pull that off,

00:01:02.786 --> 00:01:04.876
you need a group of
six or seven adults

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:06.746
who are those kids' primary teachers.

00:01:06.746 --> 00:01:09.326
You need those adults to
understand the big picture

00:01:09.326 --> 00:01:10.566
of where they want
that learning to go.

00:01:11.226 --> 00:01:13.626
They have to be able to
engage with the community

00:01:13.626 --> 00:01:17.406
and find the right connection, and
they have to be able to think about,

00:01:17.406 --> 00:01:18.756
"So, I'm a field biologist.

00:01:19.216 --> 00:01:21.006
Well, what is it that
a field biologist does?

00:01:21.396 --> 00:01:24.066
Who's the right field biologist to
get in here to work with our kids,

00:01:24.436 --> 00:01:26.916
and if we take what a field
biologist does, what does that look

00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:28.286
like when a seventh-grader does it?

00:01:28.346 --> 00:01:30.936
How do we modify it so it's
a seventh-grader activity

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:34.616
so that seventh-graders can really
do that well and accomplish this sort

00:01:34.616 --> 00:01:36.366
of appearance of the same goals

00:01:36.696 --> 00:01:38.356
that a real field biologist
would engage in."

00:01:39.486 --> 00:01:43.426
&gt;&gt;We adopted the expeditionary
learning model at the beginning

00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:50.316
in 1993, and the laptop
initiative began in 2001 or 2002.

00:01:51.036 --> 00:01:53.306
By the time the laptop
initiative came out,

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:55.256
we were already pretty well-versed

00:01:55.256 --> 00:01:56.896
in what project-based
learning looked like.

00:01:57.176 --> 00:01:58.696
We still had a lot of work to do.

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:03.536
We always have a lot of work to do in
this area, but that gradual process

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:07.326
of change meant that it was a change
that meant changing the culture

00:02:07.326 --> 00:02:09.926
of the school, changing
the culture of the --

00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:12.746
changing the way educators
thought about doing their work,

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:17.186
changing the structures within
the school as we began to see

00:02:17.776 --> 00:02:21.416
that certain things are too difficult
to expect in a lockdown structure,

00:02:21.786 --> 00:02:23.946
finding ways to open
that structure over time.

00:02:24.796 --> 00:02:27.546
We have summer planning
institutes, which we've been doing

00:02:27.546 --> 00:02:32.756
for 15 years now, where almost the
entire staff comes in for three

00:02:32.756 --> 00:02:34.926
or four days in the
summer, works together

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:38.596
around planning learning expeditions,
critiques each other's work,

00:02:38.916 --> 00:02:40.966
talks about common
resources we could share.

00:02:41.416 --> 00:02:43.476
We look at different kinds of
products people are making.

00:02:43.476 --> 00:02:45.936
We talk about the learning that
could happen in those products.

00:02:46.546 --> 00:02:48.326
So, we've been doing
that for a long time.

00:02:48.326 --> 00:02:52.976
We've had a celebration of
learning for 13 or 14 years now,

00:02:53.536 --> 00:02:56.956
where at a given point in the
year at the end of the year we put

00:02:56.956 --> 00:02:59.006
out all the learning
that kids have done,

00:02:59.006 --> 00:03:00.436
all the products that kids have done.

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:02.506
We invite educators
from around the country

00:03:02.506 --> 00:03:03.536
to come and look at that work.

00:03:03.536 --> 00:03:05.016
Our kids all talk about
their learning.

00:03:05.636 --> 00:03:07.196
That's been going on for a long time.

00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:09.886
&gt;&gt;By the time those laptops came out,

00:03:09.886 --> 00:03:14.276
we already had done deep
multimedia work with kids,

00:03:14.276 --> 00:03:16.266
so we felt quite ready for them.

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:17.846
In fact, we were feeling held back

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:19.936
by not having laptops
before they showed up.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.606
So, when they came it was like
we hit the ground running,

00:03:22.936 --> 00:03:26.506
and when I say "we,"
I mean some of us.

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:32.946
So, some of us in the school
were doing the kinds of things

00:03:33.886 --> 00:03:37.876
that we felt like over time we
wanted to see everybody doing,

00:03:37.876 --> 00:03:40.176
and that's one of the great things

00:03:40.176 --> 00:03:41.576
about the leadership
structure at King.

00:03:41.576 --> 00:03:43.616
It's extremely flexible,
like everything else.

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.866
Most of us do two or three
things and nobody cares

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.876
if somebody else is doing the
same thing as another person.

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:53.836
Everybody's overlapping and working
together to get the job done.

00:03:54.016 --> 00:03:57.856
When it came to looking at
the best practice of learning

00:03:57.856 --> 00:04:00.546
and teaching here at the
school, nobody thought

00:04:00.546 --> 00:04:02.346
about it first and did it second.

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:07.976
Everybody here had ideas that were
driven by values and sort of hunches

00:04:07.976 --> 00:04:11.016
about how learning should work,
and then we started doing that

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:15.136
and then we started to catalog
our success, and that cataloguing

00:04:15.136 --> 00:04:18.736
of success led to looking at
what were the practices that made

00:04:18.736 --> 00:04:22.006
that possible and then
institutionalizing those practices

00:04:22.006 --> 00:04:25.336
over time through a process
of recording and documenting

00:04:25.756 --> 00:04:28.176
and doing professional
development around that work.

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:32.756
&gt;&gt;The way traditional schools are
set up is they're training children

00:04:32.756 --> 00:04:35.476
and young adults to
become mini-professors.

00:04:36.046 --> 00:04:38.236
You've got your mini-professor
of English

00:04:38.236 --> 00:04:39.996
and you've got your
mini-professor of science

00:04:40.456 --> 00:04:41.556
or your mini-professor of math.

00:04:42.486 --> 00:04:44.856
And that's just the model and
the paradigm we're working with,

00:04:45.846 --> 00:04:48.746
but that paradigm doesn't
really suit the needs of kids

00:04:48.806 --> 00:04:54.256
or the world anymore today, so
one problem that we're facing is

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:57.146
that most schools don't even
realize that they're working

00:04:57.146 --> 00:04:58.556
from within a modeled framework.

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:00.466
That doesn't really
make sense anymore.

00:05:01.416 --> 00:05:04.446
Then we look out and we think about,
well, what's an alternative model?

00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:06.776
And we think, well, we'd like it
to be more like the real world,

00:05:07.106 --> 00:05:09.856
and a lot of schools have said, "We'd
really like our school to be more

00:05:09.856 --> 00:05:13.386
like the real world," but they
break down around structures

00:05:13.386 --> 00:05:14.936
that would support
that within the school.

00:05:15.506 --> 00:05:18.096
What it takes in a lot of
schools is a kind of heroic effort

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:22.526
by a few people to pull off these
complex learning experiences

00:05:22.526 --> 00:05:26.686
for kids, and we found here
that heroic effort is great once

00:05:26.686 --> 00:05:28.446
and a while, but it's a burnout.

00:05:29.146 --> 00:05:32.216
So, unless you find a way to
support that within the structure

00:05:32.216 --> 00:05:36.046
of the school itself, you're going to
burn out trying to turn your school

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:37.726
into something that's
really meaningful for kids.

00:05:37.976 --> 00:05:42.666
&gt;&gt;Most schools are divided into
40- or 50- or 60-minute blocks.

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:45.126
They might think they're progressive
if they do 80-minute blocks,

00:05:45.726 --> 00:05:47.066
but that's not what
we're talking about.

00:05:47.066 --> 00:05:49.016
We're talking about a schedule
here at King Middle School,

00:05:49.536 --> 00:05:53.696
where a team of five or six experts
in learning, your teachers, can say,

00:05:53.696 --> 00:05:57.356
"In order to pull off this particular
project at this particular stage,

00:05:57.726 --> 00:06:00.726
in order to make the workflow happen
that we need to accomplish with kids,

00:06:01.106 --> 00:06:02.896
we need to design a whole
new schedule this week."

00:06:03.606 --> 00:06:05.566
And that's what we have
here at King Middle School.

00:06:05.566 --> 00:06:06.436
There aren't any bells.

00:06:06.836 --> 00:06:09.986
Nobody actually knows where
anybody is most of the time,

00:06:09.986 --> 00:06:13.276
but that's the way real work
happens, and we all know that.

00:06:13.276 --> 00:06:16.266
If we're working in the world and
we're in any kind of engineering

00:06:16.266 --> 00:06:19.426
or design process or we're
editing movies or making sounds

00:06:19.426 --> 00:06:21.746
or we're doing whatever
it is that people do,

00:06:21.946 --> 00:06:24.096
nobody stops after 40
minutes, puts everything down

00:06:24.096 --> 00:06:25.336
and goes on to do something else.

00:06:25.846 --> 00:06:28.106
So, flexible schedules is very key.

00:06:28.976 --> 00:06:31.466
Another piece, which is around
time and time management:

00:06:31.886 --> 00:06:35.176
Schools need to absolutely
commit the time for planning

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:38.066
and collaborative planning
within the schedule framework

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:40.556
so that all teachers
can work together

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:44.316
to integrate the curriculum pieces
and do the basic nuts and bolts

00:06:44.316 --> 00:06:47.426
and workflow planning to make
something complicated happen

00:06:47.426 --> 00:06:51.376
for 80 kids over the
course of 8, 10, 12 weeks.

00:06:51.886 --> 00:06:52.666
It's not easy.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.916
It takes a lot of teamwork,
which is also not easy,

00:06:57.276 --> 00:07:00.456
and it also takes a absolute
commitment on the part

00:07:00.456 --> 00:07:03.856
of the school administration and the
leadership to carve out that time

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:06.296
and make it sacred
for teacher planning.

00:07:07.446 --> 00:07:10.866
&gt;&gt;Another piece of the framework
that's critical is you need

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:12.836
to have the right resources
in students' hands,

00:07:13.186 --> 00:07:15.866
and for us that's been
a variety of things;

00:07:16.226 --> 00:07:18.896
not least important has been
the 1-to-1 Laptop Initiative.

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:21.576
Now, I wouldn't say it's
the most important thing.

00:07:21.576 --> 00:07:23.436
I would say it's among
the most important things,

00:07:23.436 --> 00:07:26.946
because you also need to have the
right reading resources for kids,

00:07:27.386 --> 00:07:30.756
so you have to be able to identify
developmentally appropriate reading

00:07:30.756 --> 00:07:33.216
materials for all kids within topics,

00:07:33.216 --> 00:07:35.436
or else you don't really have
a topic that will fly for kids.

00:07:35.436 --> 00:07:38.536
But at the same time, if you don't
give them a tool like a laptop,

00:07:38.886 --> 00:07:41.856
a real, professional tool that
professionals would use all the time

00:07:41.856 --> 00:07:45.546
in any field, then you've taken
away the opportunity for kids to act

00:07:45.546 --> 00:07:49.816
like real professionals or to
produce real professional products.

00:07:49.816 --> 00:07:51.036
&gt;&gt;Anybody who's spent time working

00:07:51.036 --> 00:07:53.316
with computers knows they're
actually more complicated

00:07:53.316 --> 00:07:54.516
than people would have you believe.

00:07:55.076 --> 00:07:58.426
It's difficult to know how to manage
the workflow through a project.

00:07:59.086 --> 00:08:02.596
We have a teacher here in the
building whose job is to work

00:08:02.596 --> 00:08:05.466
with all seventh-graders and
to manage that sort of workflow

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:08.036
with kids and teach them
what that looks like.

00:08:08.576 --> 00:08:10.846
And, in fact, we've kind of
spread that out in a lot of ways,

00:08:10.846 --> 00:08:13.636
creating lots of different production
houses within the school so that

00:08:13.636 --> 00:08:17.666
as kids pass through different
curriculum areas, teachers can rely

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:21.426
on experts in production
within their own team framework

00:08:21.426 --> 00:08:23.526
to help them build
those kinds of projects.

00:08:24.046 --> 00:08:25.116
So, I would call that knowhow.

00:08:25.586 --> 00:08:27.956
It's one thing to have the
resources, but you totally need

00:08:27.956 --> 00:08:29.486
to have the knowhow
built into the building.

00:08:30.836 --> 00:08:34.536
&gt;&gt;We go through a process as staff
where we critique each other's work,

00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:38.566
and that's a model for how we
do our work with kids as well.

00:08:39.256 --> 00:08:42.876
We know that getting to the best
product for all kids means a period

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:48.096
of revision and assessment, formative
assessment, looking at kids' work,

00:08:48.326 --> 00:08:50.906
and when I say "looking at kids'
work," I don't mean adults looking

00:08:50.906 --> 00:08:52.286
at kids' work exclusively.

00:08:52.596 --> 00:08:56.116
I mean kids looking at
kids' work based upon models

00:08:56.116 --> 00:08:57.956
that they've already
looked at and seen.

00:08:58.446 --> 00:09:02.426
Our teachers produce -- we
call them "exemplar models"

00:09:02.426 --> 00:09:06.546
of the products our kids are going to
make before the kids actually do it.

00:09:07.206 --> 00:09:09.436
And so, often the kids look
at what a teacher's made

00:09:09.436 --> 00:09:10.306
and they say, "You know what?

00:09:10.746 --> 00:09:12.326
I get it and I think I
could do that better."

00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:16.946
And that whole process leads
to our kids also beginning

00:09:16.946 --> 00:09:21.026
to define the criteria of what a
high-quality product would look like,

00:09:21.296 --> 00:09:22.316
and that's not informal.

00:09:22.316 --> 00:09:23.336
We formalize that.

00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:26.946
We design rubrics and
create rubrics with our kids

00:09:27.406 --> 00:09:31.766
that define what quality would
look like, and then our kids work

00:09:31.766 --> 00:09:34.666
to meet their own definition
of quality.

00:09:35.356 --> 00:09:38.906
That's very collaborative,
so our kids work together.

00:09:38.906 --> 00:09:40.716
They do peer editing,
and near the end

00:09:40.716 --> 00:09:44.326
of an expedition sometimes
there's a week or six

00:09:44.326 --> 00:09:47.786
or seven days set aside just for
looking at drafts and revisions,

00:09:47.786 --> 00:09:53.116
drafts and revisions, to get to a
high-quality final product with kids.

00:09:53.116 --> 00:09:54.976
&gt;&gt;All kids learn in different ways,

00:09:55.286 --> 00:09:57.746
and we know that all kids
learn at different speeds.

00:09:58.526 --> 00:10:02.656
And what we've tried to do is
ask teams of teachers to think

00:10:02.656 --> 00:10:06.856
about how they can bring different
kinds of media and different kinds

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:10.876
of representations of learning into
the products that they're making.

00:10:11.846 --> 00:10:15.006
We've often asked teams to
think about if you're going

00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:17.816
to do this piece around
producing a document, for example,

00:10:19.336 --> 00:10:22.536
with the Taking Care
of Business expedition,

00:10:23.106 --> 00:10:25.416
we've got all those kids
producing business plans

00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:26.546
and making little businesses

00:10:26.546 --> 00:10:28.806
and they're writing these things
that're official little business

00:10:28.806 --> 00:10:30.446
plans at the same time that down

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:33.376
in Joe Farrell's room
producing a piece of music.

00:10:33.376 --> 00:10:36.356
And, for kids who love music,
that might be the hook,

00:10:37.096 --> 00:10:40.436
and for kids who love writing,
which my daughter's a kid

00:10:40.436 --> 00:10:42.496
who loves writing,
that's the hook too.

00:10:42.856 --> 00:10:47.056
You might think of it a
little bit as like a pop song.

00:10:47.156 --> 00:10:49.686
We need to make sure we have the
hook in there for all different kinds

00:10:49.686 --> 00:10:51.166
of kids and all the
different kinds of learners,

00:10:51.166 --> 00:10:52.636
and we're very aware of that.

00:10:53.056 --> 00:10:56.386
We often ask that all
expeditions include a piece of art

00:10:56.706 --> 00:10:59.916
that kids are producing, and we
make sure that the output media

00:10:59.916 --> 00:11:03.076
of the product can hold a variety
of different kinds of media

00:11:03.076 --> 00:11:06.306
so kids can feel proud
of the piece they drew.

00:11:06.736 --> 00:11:07.946
If they're not as proud
of their writing,

00:11:07.946 --> 00:11:09.426
they might think this
is a great piece of art

00:11:09.426 --> 00:11:10.646
that supports it that they made.

00:11:11.106 --> 00:11:15.416
So, bringing in the capacity of kids
to represent curriculum in a variety

00:11:15.416 --> 00:11:16.896
of media, in a variety

00:11:16.896 --> 00:11:22.266
of intelligences just makes it more
possible for kids to feel successful.

00:11:22.266 --> 00:11:24.456
&gt;&gt;We make sure that our kids feel
like they're a part of a team,

00:11:25.136 --> 00:11:27.206
so our kids -- they actually
don't call them "teams" here.

00:11:27.206 --> 00:11:30.766
We call them "houses," and our kids
have the same houses for two years

00:11:30.766 --> 00:11:32.446
in a row, the same teachers.

00:11:32.446 --> 00:11:36.966
We do looping, and
there's a strong commitment

00:11:37.556 --> 00:11:41.086
that every child will be known
by at least one significant adult

00:11:41.186 --> 00:11:45.886
in the school, so we have crews,
and a crew is only about 10,

00:11:46.376 --> 00:11:51.386
8 to 12 kids big, and that
8-to-12-kid group meets once a week

00:11:51.716 --> 00:11:53.876
with their crew leader,
who's one of the faculty.

00:11:54.236 --> 00:11:58.706
It's not necessarily their teacher,
and those groups of kids do things

00:11:58.706 --> 00:12:00.526
like initiatives together
with the teacher,

00:12:01.016 --> 00:12:02.816
all kinds of different experiences,

00:12:03.216 --> 00:12:06.206
and they also manage the
learning-portfolio process

00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:07.796
with that particular crew teacher.

00:12:08.466 --> 00:12:14.046
And then we have teams that
are just totally committed

00:12:14.046 --> 00:12:16.816
to kids treating each
other respectfully.

00:12:17.346 --> 00:12:19.936
Our kids go out and
do community service.

00:12:19.996 --> 00:12:22.536
Lots of our teams, whether
it's expedition time or not,

00:12:22.926 --> 00:12:25.956
do volunteer work in the community.

00:12:25.956 --> 00:12:27.516
We take our seventh-graders.

00:12:27.516 --> 00:12:30.596
Our whole seventh grade goes
out camping for three days,

00:12:30.896 --> 00:12:33.646
and it's all based around
teamwork, communication.

00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:38.596
We have a ropes course in our gym.

00:12:38.696 --> 00:12:44.296
We're very happy to have
competitive experiences for our kids,

00:12:44.326 --> 00:12:47.266
but we also try to balance
that with collaboration

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:48.816
and compassion and care for our kids.

00:12:48.816 --> 00:12:52.136
We teach those things explicitly, and
I think when you come into King --

00:12:52.596 --> 00:12:53.686
I think everybody says this --

00:12:53.686 --> 00:12:55.546
the place does just
have a really good vibe.

00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:56.606
It feels really good.

00:12:57.036 --> 00:12:57.896
It's not cliquey.

00:12:58.536 --> 00:13:03.926
Kids all get along with one
another, and it's remarkable.

00:13:05.046 --> 00:13:06.786
