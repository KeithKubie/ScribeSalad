ALVARO: Let us all
welcome our distinguished

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.976
guest, Alex Filippenko.

00:00:03.976 --> 00:00:06.844
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.540
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Well,
thank you very much, Alvaro,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.520
for that very kind introduction.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.240
It's really a pleasure for
me to be here again today.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.180
I last spoke at Google
in November of 2013.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.790
And I remember many of
the faces from that talk.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.580
So it's especially a
pleasure, actually,

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.610
to be speaking here about Lick
Observatory and the research

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.130
we're doing there, because,
as I'll mention more

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.180
near the end of my talk, Google,
through Google Making Science,

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.180
is now a partner with us, a
supporter of Lick Observatory

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.359
through a generous gift.

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.150
And we're actually
doing a number of things

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.610
together in order to
increase public understanding

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.080
of science, and
astronomy in particular.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.270
So thank you so much, Google.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.870
It's been a great beginning.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.670
And we look forward to a
really wonderful partnership.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.640
And this is really
the boost we needed.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.750
And I'll talk about that
more near the very end.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.240
So the Lick Observatory
is owned and operated

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.640
by the University of California.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.560
You can see it from here,
actually, from Silicon Valley.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.430
It's those little
white mushrooms

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.970
at the top of Mount
Hamilton, California.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.470
If you go up there,
you notice that it's

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.290
a very, very long, windy road--
19 miles following the contours

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.640
of the mountain, very windy.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.590
Not very steep because
things were brought up

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.120
by horse and carriage
more than 120 years ago.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.215
And so it's a favorite
among bicyclists.

00:01:31.215 --> 00:01:35.400
And I know many Googlers
love to ride their bicycles.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.190
And I've met Googlers
up in the parking

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.010
lot at Lick Observatory.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.110
So there they are.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.120
Just if you do this,
be very careful

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:46.740
of all the crazy car drivers
on Mount Hamilton Road, OK?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.800
But anyway, it's just
not a very steep road

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.510
because everything was brought
up by horse and carriage

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.360
So here's a photo from 1900.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.370
In 1888, when the
observatory was completed,

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.310
it was the world's first remote
mountain top observatory.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.920
Prior to that
time, observatories

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.600
were on university campuses that
tended to be in large cities

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.930
at or near sea level.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.190
But this was a
very remote place.

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.680
And it was arguably the birth
of big science in the whole US,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.600
but certainly in the Western US.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.400
And it was made possible
by a generous donation

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.170
from James Lick.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.050
James Lick has a very
interesting history.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.770
I don't have time to
go into most of it.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.770
But suffice it to say that he
came to San Francisco, which

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.640
was then Yerba Buena, at the
beginning of January, 1848,

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.400
when it was a little shanty
town of perhaps 1,000 people.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.140
He already had
considerable wealth.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.920
And he had the good
fortune of arriving

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.640
17 days before gold was
discovered at Sutter's Mill.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.330
He tried himself looking for
gold for three or four days

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.090
and then realized that this
is just not the way to go.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.410
He wants to deal
with real estate,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.960
but not with the
dirt in his fingers.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.090
So what he did is
he bought up land

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.750
that people were selling in
order to go and hunt for gold.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.320
And then he sold it back to them
after they started coming back.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.120
And of course, the Gold Rush
brought lots and lots of people

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.290
into California.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.830
So within three
years, San Francisco

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.680
was a booming city
of 20,000 or 30,000.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.250
And Lick basically owned
a good fraction of it,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.850
as well as good fractions of the
rest of California-- Catalina

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.640
Island, parts of Napa
Valley, and places like that.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.690
So he made a very large amount
of money, very, very large.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.150
Near the end of
his life, he wanted

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.560
to use that money to
commemorate his parents,

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.660
the memory of his parents.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.570
And so he was thinking maybe
of having statues erected

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.260
of his parents on Ocean
Beach facing the Pacific

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.810
Ocean until it was pointed
out to him that if we are ever

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.300
attacked from the west, these
would be the first structures

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.890
to come down, so that's
not such a good idea.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.580
So then Lick thought,
well, how about a pyramid

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.160
at the corner of Fourth and
Market Streets in San Francisco

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.490
to commemorate himself
and his parents?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.280
But you know, he was told that,
look, pyramids are no big deal.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.254
There are pyramids in
Egypt, Mexico, Central

00:04:10.254 --> 00:04:11.420
America, all over the place.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.090
So why not do something
really useful and new?

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.470
And a friend of his
was George Davidson,

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.180
who was President of the
California Academy of Sciences.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.300
And he suggested that James
Lick build a telescope.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:30.150
So in 1875, James
Lick donated $700,000

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.190
to the building of
the world's greatest,

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.360
most powerful telescope.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.140
And as a fraction
of the GDP, that's

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.750
equivalent to about $1.2 billion
today, the largest gift ever,

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.710
certainly, in the
physical sciences.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.000
So it was amazing.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.850
And a 36-inch
refractor was built.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.090
And James Lick is
buried at its base

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.170
down underneath the floor there.

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:55.620
And there you can
see the plaque,

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.920
"Here lies the body
of James Lick."

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.790
Well, that was 1888.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:05.190
At age 127, you might think,
what good is Lick these days?

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:06.620
But what I want
to show you today

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.020
is that it is doing cutting
edge research, technology

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.630
development, student
training, and public outreach.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.520
And for all these reasons, it's
really an incredible place.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.350
And we don't just have the
1888 great refractor anymore.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.220
We have other telescopes that
have been built since then,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.370
the most recent of which
is now only two years old,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.410
the Automated Planet Finder.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.160
All of these telescopes are
small by today's standards.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.530
I'm privileged to be a
user of the mighty Keck

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.600
telescopes in Hawaii.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.330
I love them.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.390
They're 10 meters in diameter.

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.080
I use them to study very, very
faint, distant, exploding stars

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.430
and galaxies.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.370
But the time is
so precious and it

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.810
is needed by so many
astronomers that you just

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:50.610
can't do certain
types of projects

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.350
that I'll be describing here.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.640
We're planning to build
a 30-meter telescope

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.610
if all goes well.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.380
And there have been some
issues, as you may have

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.450
heard in the news recently.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.760
But hopefully, the 30-meter
telescope will be built.

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.240
And that will be fantastic, too.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.110
We'll use it to study the
faintest, most distant objects

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.870
in the universe.

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.320
But time will be
very, very precious--

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.567
for UC astronomers, maybe
40 nights a year in total.

00:06:14.567 --> 00:06:16.150
So there are certain
types of research

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.830
that you simply can't do with
the Hubble and the 30-meter

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:19.460
and the Kecks.

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.760
But you can do them
with smaller telescopes,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.170
like at Lick, to which
you have repeated access.

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.830
So that's what I want to
describe to you today.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.100
I'll start with supernovae.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.000
I have always liked
things that blow up,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.244
as long as they're
used safely and stuff.

00:06:34.244 --> 00:06:36.160
You know, I'm not some
terrorist or something.

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.450
But our sun will not blow
up at the end of its life.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.480
It will die a
relatively slow death.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.670
It'll become brighter than
it is now, But in a slow way.

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:48.200
But some stars become
much, much brighter very,

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.950
very quickly because
they literally explode.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.020
This is a titanic,
colossal explosion

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.110
that can make the star
up to several billion

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.380
times the brightness of
our sun, or the luminosity,

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.210
the true power.

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.830
So here is one star in this
galaxy of 100 billion stars.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:09.450
And at its peak, it's about as
bright as the central billion

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.120
stars in this galaxy.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.280
So if our sun were to do
this-- and don't worry,

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.440
it won't-- then sun block of
50 just wouldn't cut it, folks.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:18.910
You'd need sun block,
or supernova block,

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.680
of a few billion to
protect yourself.

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:25.050
But don't worry, be happy-- our
sun is not going to do this.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.470
When stars do do this, they're
not only exciting to watch,

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.080
but they are of fundamental
importance to us,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.540
because they generate
and spew out into space

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.820
the heavy elements that are so
necessary for life on Earth.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.955
So during the normal nuclear
reactions in a star, carbon

00:07:40.955 --> 00:07:43.490
and oxygen are built up
eventually-- right now

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.820
our sun is forming
helium-- but those elements

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.240
have no way to get out.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.580
The supernova releases them
and, during the explosion,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.020
creates additional
heavy elements.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:56.220
And we can look at supernova
remnants, like this one,

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:00.150
and see that the gases are
enriched in heavy elements that

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:03.470
simply weren't there in
any significant abundance

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.670
at the time the star was born.

00:08:05.670 --> 00:08:08.780
The supernova remnants
spread out like this

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.750
and then meet up with
other clouds of gas,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.800
eventually forming giant,
gravitationally-bound clouds,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.630
like the Orion Nebula, in
the center of which you

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.520
can see lots of newly-formed,
or in some cases

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.050
still-forming, stars.

00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:26.540
And because this gas has gone
through many, many generations

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:29.780
of stellar birth and death
and chemical enrichment,

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.610
these gases are
now significantly

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.039
enriched in heavy elements.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.400
And so you can get
gas and dust disks

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.780
around newly-formed stars,
which then coagulate

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:44.770
into planets, some of which will
be rocky, Earth-like planets.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.590
And this is how our
own solar system

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.190
was born 4 and 1/2 billion
years ago from gases

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:53.270
that had gone through many,
many generations of enrichment

00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.480
of this sort.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.710
And somehow, somewhere-- I'll
leave this to the biologists--

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:59.930
lifeforms-- and it evolves.

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.720
I'm skipping a few steps here.

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.260
And it ends up-- oops.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.240
One of the pictures
somehow got hidden.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.860
But there's part of my DNA.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.730
It ends up with people who are
sentient beings that can sit

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:13.330
and look out into the cosmos.

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:17.770
And my kids just attended the
Maker's Faire a short time ago

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.900
and were particularly
thrilled by the Google booth,

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.510
where they made
rockets and stuff.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.660
So they're going to sign up
for a Maker's Camp this summer.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.990
So anyway, we are
made of star stuff.

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:28.740
So we would like to
understand the process

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.190
by which this occurs.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.060
So we'd like to find
nearby supernovae,

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.440
but they're pretty rare.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:35.580
So if you look at
some galaxies, you're

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.000
unlikely to find supernovae,
because they only go off

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.560
once every 30 or 40 years.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.320
And that would be pretty boring
looking through a telescope

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.640
in search of supernovae by eye.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:46.230
Fortunately, with
modern technology,

00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.550
we have a better technique.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.700
You attach CCD cameras to the
eyepiece end of a telescope,

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.660
take photographs of
thousands of galaxies,

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.890
and simply look for arrows.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:56.416
And where you see arrows,
you see exploding stars.

00:09:56.416 --> 00:09:58.790
You see it happened once,
twice, three times, four times,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.410
five times.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.330
By rigorous
mathematical induction,

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:04.630
I conclude that this
process works every time.

00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:07.030
Well, it doesn't.

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:09.630
You have to program
telescopes and computers

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.370
to do this and software that
will look for the new objects.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.080
And so what we have
at Lick Observatory

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.980
is a telescope
that's by no means

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.370
large by today's standards.

00:10:18.370 --> 00:10:20.610
It's only 3/4 of a
meter in diameter.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.400
But it's been
programmed expertly

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.450
by my associate Weidong
Li to look at, literally,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:29.110
thousands of galaxies each week
and to compare the new pictures

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.400
with the old pictures.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.740
And usually, there is nothing
new in the new picture.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.151
But occasionally, you'll notice
something new, this star here.

00:10:36.151 --> 00:10:37.400
I mean, the arrow is new, too.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:39.656
But that was put in with
Photoshop or something.

00:10:39.656 --> 00:10:41.030
So there is a
thing that might be

00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.710
a supernova candidate-- or,
it is a supernova candidate.

00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:45.210
It might be a supernova.

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:46.620
But it could be something else.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:49.430
It could be an asteroid flying
through the field of view,

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.240
perhaps with Earth's
name written on it.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.340
Someday, astronomers
will save humanity

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:54.810
because they'll
find the asteroids

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.640
and then applied physicists
and engineers will figure out

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.010
how to deflect them.

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:02.200
But anyway, one person's garbage
is another person's gold.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.430
I don't want the asteroids.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:06.240
I don't want the cosmic rays,
which are charged particles

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.740
that interact with the CCD.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.230
I want the supernovae.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:11.690
So out of a couple of dozen
candidates each night,

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.220
maybe one of them will be
a supernova, maybe none.

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.640
And there, I used students who,
with their superb eye-brain

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.560
combination, look
at the candidates

00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.570
and determine which ones are
likely to be genuine supernovae

00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:24.540
worthy of further study.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.170
And these students,
often starting

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.760
in their freshman year,
even, get so excited when

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.910
they find a supernova.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:31.480
And they write home
to Mom about it.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.920
And then they analyze the data.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:37.540
And they get trained in lots
of science data analysis, error

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.690
propagation,
statistical techniques.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:43.180
Most don't go on to become
professors of astrophysics

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.250
at universities.

00:11:44.250 --> 00:11:48.310
Most go on and become more
immediately useful to society

00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:50.910
as engineers, applied
physicists, medical physicists,

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:52.760
computer scientists,
people like that.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.010
But they get that early
exposure to research

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.450
through groups such as mine
at Berkeley and the UC system

00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:00.140
throughout.

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:01.890
But my point here--
and this is the mantra

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.730
throughout the whole talk-- is
that for this kind of research,

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.260
just having a few nights per
year on the biggest telescopes

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.790
does you no good whatsoever.

00:12:08.790 --> 00:12:11.470
You need huge amounts of
time, months or years,

00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.160
on small or
modest-sized telescopes.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.312
Once we or others--
I'm not saying we're

00:12:16.312 --> 00:12:17.770
the only ones who
find supernovae--

00:12:17.770 --> 00:12:20.070
but once we or others
find a supernova,

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:22.150
we'd like to study
that supernova.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.530
We collect more light
with a bigger telescope,

00:12:24.530 --> 00:12:26.200
like the 3-meter
telescope at Lick.

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.690
And then we're able to spread
the light out into a spectrum,

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.790
plot the intensity
versus the wavelength.

00:12:31.790 --> 00:12:33.920
And when you do this
for enough supernovae,

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.110
you find that they come in
several well-defined groups--

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:40.820
the Type I's that don't have
hydrogen and the Type II's that

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:41.670
do.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:44.540
But here, you can see calcium,
oxygen, silicon, sulfur, iron,

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:47.140
magnesium, the elements
that were generated

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:52.030
during the star's life and
during its explosion, elements

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:54.670
that are necessary for
Earth and for life on Earth.

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.150
So there are other
types, as well.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:59.340
But we study them
in some detail.

00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.760
And getting one
spectrum isn't enough,

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.100
because you're
then just sampling

00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:08.220
the chemical elements that
are on the outside parts

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:09.500
of the star.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.150
But as the exploding
star expands,

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:16.050
the gases thin out and
become transparent.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.930
And you see down into
deeper and deeper layers.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.170
So by getting a series
of spectra over time--

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.880
from 12 days before peak
brightness, in this case,

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.330
to several months
after peak brightness--

00:13:27.330 --> 00:13:30.580
you can get, essentially, a CAT
scan of this exploding star,

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:34.420
because you see the
different layers up

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.510
to where it's transparent down
to where it becomes opaque.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.190
And that boundary moves
farther and farther in.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.400
So at early times, you see
things like calcium and silicon

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.160
and stuff.

00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:46.650
And at late times, you see iron.

00:13:46.650 --> 00:13:48.400
And so, in fact, that
shows that the iron

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.240
is produced in the
explosion close

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.150
to the center of
the exploding star.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.990
And students are involved
in the spectroscopy

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:58.780
as well as in the discovery
of the supernovae.

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:02.080
They also get the light
curves of the supernovae,

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.970
the brightness versus time.

00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:05.460
And again, this
tells us something

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.030
about the physics of what's
going on in these two

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.370
main types, the Ia's Type IIs.

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:13.050
And we do this, again,
with just a small telescope

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.230
because these are bright,
nearby exploding stars.

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:18.470
What we need is lots
and lots of time

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:21.190
on a small telescope,
not a little bit of time

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:22.560
on the biggest telescopes.

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.890
And students are
involved throughout,

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.760
more so now than ever
before, because we now

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.560
have these remote
observing stations set up

00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:34.490
at each of the UC campuses,
where students can essentially

00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:36.420
talk to the telescope
operator-- or run

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.720
the telescope themselves,
in this case-- get the data,

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.750
analyze the data.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.670
It's as though they're
up on the summit.

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.180
But they're not
up at the summit.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:46.920
That's great, because students
are busy with courses.

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.510
And generally, they
don't have cars.

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:51.390
And it's a four-hour round trip
from Berkeley or Santa Cruz,

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:54.720
not even to mention UCLA,
San Diego, Riverside, Irvine.

00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.500
Those are all much more distant.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.230
So students are now involved
more than ever in real research

00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.970
because of the remote
facilities set up

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:03.750
at the different campuses.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.500
I then have a group lunch once
a week-- my group lunch will

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.840
be tomorrow--
where I bring pizza

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.660
and they justify their
existence for the previous week.

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.569
They'll do anything,
undergraduates and grad

00:15:13.569 --> 00:15:15.110
students and postdocs,
for free food.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.530
And we just discuss
all of our projects.

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:19.010
And everyone helps each other.

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:21.790
It's a really
groupthink-type experience.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:22.610
It's wonderful.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:25.010
But again, to get
spectra and light curves,

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:26.570
you need lots and lots of time.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:27.850
That's the mantra.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:31.110
And someone who was very
inspired by the work we

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:34.340
did in setting up the Katzman
telescope and the success

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.360
we achieved with it was,
in fact, Wayne Rosing,

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.650
who left Google some years
ago and has started up

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:44.600
this gigantic thing called the
Las Cumbres Observatory Global

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.720
Telescope Network.

00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:48.290
He and his team in Santa
Barbara have set up

00:15:48.290 --> 00:15:51.065
telescopes of this sort
modeled after our telescope

00:15:51.065 --> 00:15:52.750
at Lick throughout the world.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:57.560
And their motto is, "The
sun never rises on LCOGT."

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.720
In other words,
at some longitude,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.480
there's always a telescope
where the sun is down.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.600
So that's fantastic.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.120
I want to tell you one
application of the Type Ia

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:09.680
supernovae.

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.420
And this was the subject of
my talk back in November.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:13.920
So if you want to
hear more details,

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:15.860
you can go online
and watch that talk.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:19.260
But the point is that the
universe is expanding.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:22.080
We've known that ever
since Hubble's work, which

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.700
showed that the
light from galaxies

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.830
is shifted toward longer
wavelengths, redder

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:29.590
wavelengths.

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.340
And the greater the distance,
the greater is this redshift.

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:35.380
And we now know
that this is because

00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:37.300
of an expansion of space itself.

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:40.290
Hubble himself resisted
that interpretation back

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.340
in the late 1920s
and early 1930s.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.660
But we now know
that it's the case.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:49.440
And so you look at all these
galaxies, and you wonder, well,

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.610
will they keep on expanding
away from each other forever?

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:57.430
Or will they someday return
back into a denser structure?

00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:00.199
And if the density
is big enough--

00:17:00.199 --> 00:17:01.990
the density of the
universe, visible matter

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:03.450
and dark matter--
then everything

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:06.010
will pull in everything else
so much that, eventually,

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:07.250
the expansion will stop.

00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.280
And then it will reverse itself.

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.980
And the universe will implode.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.890
So Big Bang, Big Crunch.

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:14.960
Or you could say, Big
Bang, "gnab, gib,"

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.740
which is Big Bang backwards.

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:18.640
And so if you were
in this universe

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.970
and lying on your back
looking at the galaxies,

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:23.266
they would look progressively
fainter and smaller.

00:17:23.266 --> 00:17:25.349
And you would say, yes, I
live in a good universe.

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:27.480
And then you'd notice
something a bit peculiar.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.970
And right around now, you'd
start getting a little nervous.

00:17:29.970 --> 00:17:31.790
And then, you know,
goodbye, cruel world,

00:17:31.790 --> 00:17:34.340
because the universe
would collapse in on you.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.220
All right.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.040
On the other hand,
you might live

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.440
in a sufficiently
low-density universe

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.660
that the expansion,
though slowing down

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.930
with time because of
gravity, never quite

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.230
comes to a complete stop.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.230
And that's, of course,
like launching something

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.850
at a speed greater than
Earth's escape speed.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.900
In that case, the
galaxies would continue

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.790
to get fainter and smaller
in the sky forever,

00:17:54.790 --> 00:17:58.190
albeit at a progressively
decreasing rate, because there

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:00.400
is some gravity
acting upon them.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.600
Well, we would like to know
which kind of a universe

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.516
we live in, all right?

00:18:03.516 --> 00:18:06.240
And so here's the scale
factor, the distance

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.090
between two clusters of
galaxies versus time.

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:11.040
Here's the universe
that expands for a while

00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:13.340
and then undergoes a Big Crunch.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.870
Here's an empty universe.

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.770
It expands forever
at the same rate

00:18:16.770 --> 00:18:17.964
because there is no gravity.

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:20.130
Clearly, we're somewhere
in between because it's not

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:21.580
an empty universe.

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:23.560
Here's sort of a
medium-density universe.

00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.480
This is one that expands
forever, but just barely.

00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.310
And most measurements of
the density of the universe

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.300
suggested back in
the early 1990s

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:35.010
that we live in a universe
that has about 30%

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:36.550
of the critical density.

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:40.850
That is, it's a universe that
will expand forever easily,

00:18:40.850 --> 00:18:42.950
not just barely.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:47.460
But it would be interesting to
see whether this is actually

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:51.604
supported by a measurement
of the past history

00:18:51.604 --> 00:18:52.270
of the universe.

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:54.800
In other words,
which of these curves

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.050
has the universe been following?

00:18:57.050 --> 00:19:00.140
Then we could predict what
it will do in the past.

00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.189
So we want to measure the
expansion history to determine

00:19:04.189 --> 00:19:05.230
the fate of the universe.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:07.620
It's a little bit like
measuring the speed of the apple

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.850
at many, many times.

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.760
Seeing how much it's
slowing down from that,

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.240
you can calculate whether
it'll speed up or not.

00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:17.140
So let's look at the left part
of this diagram more closely.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:20.660
The definition of the redshift
is that 1 plus the redshift

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.166
is simply the scale
factor of the universe--

00:19:24.166 --> 00:19:25.540
the distance
between two clusters

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:29.350
of galaxies now-- divided
by what it was back

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:30.590
when the light was emitted.

00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.220
So redshift 0--
well, 1 plus 0 is 1.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.350
Even a non-Googler
understands that.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.760
And so this ratio is 1.

00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:38.750
Redshift 1-- well, that
means that the light

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.950
was emitted when the universe
was essentially half its size.

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:46.400
So let's draw a line
now, redshift 0.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.840
And let's go to redshift 1.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.050
At that time, the universe
was half its size.

00:19:51.050 --> 00:19:53.280
You can see that, depending
on the past history

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.190
of the universe,
redshift 1 corresponds

00:19:56.190 --> 00:20:00.160
to different lookback times,
and hence different distances,

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.980
because light travels
through the universe

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:03.240
at the speed of light.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.340
The lookback time, and
hence the distance,

00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:09.080
of a redshift 1 object is
smallest for a dense universe,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.450
bigger for a less
dense, medium universe,

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:13.590
bigger still for a
low-density universe,

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.320
bigger still for
an empty universe.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.020
So the functional form between
the redshift and the distance

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:27.830
is what ends up being a measure
of what kind of a universe

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:28.330
we live in.

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:29.788
You want to measure
that functional

00:20:29.788 --> 00:20:33.400
form between the lookback time
or distance and the redshift.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.070
The theoretical models give
you a different functional form

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:38.000
depending on what
universe you live in.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.350
And of course, all these
curves meet right here.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:45.190
Now two clusters have
whatever separation

00:20:45.190 --> 00:20:47.370
they have, and they're
expanding at whatever

00:20:47.370 --> 00:20:48.720
the current expansion rate is.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.790
That's the slope.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:51.800
So all these curves
have to meet now.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.810
But they diverge as
you go back in time.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.580
And that's what this
graph is showing.

00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:58.860
That's the theoretical view.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:00.550
Here's the observational view.

00:21:00.550 --> 00:21:04.810
If you measure redshift and
distance and plot the points--

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:06.610
this part is what Hubble found.

00:21:06.610 --> 00:21:08.530
You go out to big
enough redshifts,

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.500
you should see which
of these curves

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:12.950
the universe has been following.

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:15.490
And that will tell you
the cosmological model

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:17.030
that applies to our universe.

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:18.540
So redshifts are
easy to measure.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.514
Just get a spectrum
and see how much

00:21:20.514 --> 00:21:21.680
the lines have been shifted.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.340
Here's 0.

00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.906
Here, by 10%.

00:21:23.906 --> 00:21:25.670
So that galaxy is
moving away from us

00:21:25.670 --> 00:21:27.046
at 30,000 kilometers per second.

00:21:27.046 --> 00:21:27.670
So that's easy.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:28.760
Redshifts are easy.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:30.780
Distances are a bit harder.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:32.390
The way we do it
is the same way you

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.460
judge the distance of an
oncoming car at night.

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:36.751
You look at the relative
brightnesses of the headlights

00:21:36.751 --> 00:21:38.960
and you use the inverse
square law in your mind.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.440
Well, for galaxies that are
sufficiently distant to apply

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:45.030
this test, you're not going
to see individual stars,

00:21:45.030 --> 00:21:47.720
because these galaxies are
billions of light years away.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.820
So you're not going to see
a sun-like star or even

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.500
a fairly bright star, like
a Cepheid variable, which

00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.140
is what Edwin Hubble used
to get the low redshift

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:56.720
end of the Hubble diagram.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.890
But supernovae, in
fact, are bright enough

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:01.250
to be seen at distances of
billions of light years.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.190
That's the key.

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:05.400
So you can measure nearby ones
in galaxies whose distance you

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:07.290
already know through
some other technique,

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:08.910
like measuring
Cepheid variables.

00:22:08.910 --> 00:22:11.630
And then you find one in
some pathetic little galaxy,

00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:12.130
like this.

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:12.650
There it is.

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:16.310
You subtract one epoch from
another, and you find it.

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.310
And you can take
measurements of it

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:21.090
and do the inverse square law
and figure out the distance,

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.910
and hence the lookback time.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.170
So that's the idea.

00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:28.010
And this is best done with
the subclass called Type Ia's.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:31.604
These are quite standard
in how powerful they are.

00:22:31.604 --> 00:22:33.520
And that's because they
come from a weird type

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.770
of a star called a white dwarf.

00:22:35.770 --> 00:22:38.260
Our own sun will turn
into a white dwarf

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.360
in about 7 billion
years, at which time

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.260
it will be about the
size of the Earth.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:44.544
And it won't explode.

00:22:44.544 --> 00:22:46.210
It'll just sort of
sit there, because it

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:47.540
doesn't have a companion.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.760
But those that have a
sufficiently nearby companion

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.980
can steal material from that
companion, grow in mass,

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:57.590
and eventually reach an
unstable limit, at which point

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:58.520
they explode.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.680
And that unstable limit
should be the same each time.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.280
And so they should explode in
exactly the same way each time

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.070
and reach the same
peak luminosity.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.910
That's true to first order.

00:23:13.910 --> 00:23:15.520
But when you look
more carefully,

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.240
such as the work that my
team did in the early 1990s,

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:22.040
you find that there are,
in fact, differences

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.930
among the Type Ia supernovae.

00:23:23.930 --> 00:23:27.080
Even though they are all
approximately the same,

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.150
when you look carefully,
there are differences.

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.590
And here's spectra
of three supernovae

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:34.490
that I studied in
the early 1990s.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:36.950
You can see that there are
spectroscopic differences

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:38.450
among them.

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:40.800
There are differences
in various places.

00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:44.306
This big absorption
trough here is not that--

00:23:44.306 --> 00:23:47.060
And in fact, measurements
of their peak brightness

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.080
shows that they are
different, as well.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.310
So we were sort of stuck for
a while in the early 1990s

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:56.840
until Mark Phillips and Mario
Hamuy developed a relationship.

00:23:56.840 --> 00:24:00.080
They found, by
looking at supernovae

00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.480
that are bright and nearby in
galaxies of known distance,

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:06.420
that the intrinsically
more luminous ones

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.670
decline more rapidly than
the less luminous ones.

00:24:10.670 --> 00:24:13.120
And we now know that they
rise more-- I'm sorry,

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.850
decline more slowly is
what I meant to say.

00:24:15.850 --> 00:24:18.274
The luminous ones
decline more slowly

00:24:18.274 --> 00:24:19.440
than the less luminous ones.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:22.650
And we now know that they
rise more slowly, as well.

00:24:22.650 --> 00:24:24.900
So once you've determined
this relationship

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:28.390
by using Type Ia supernovae
in galaxies of known distance,

00:24:28.390 --> 00:24:31.580
you can then apply it
to the distant ones,

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:34.140
measure their light
curves, and figure out

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.900
whether this is a
normal luminosity

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:39.330
one, an over luminous one,
or a sub-luminous one.

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:42.350
So instead of saying, these
are all 100-watt light bulbs,

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:44.950
plus or minus 50 watts-- by
the way, they are much more

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.450
luminous, of course--
you could say,

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.340
this one is 116,
plus or minus 20,

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.852
and, this one is 94,
plus or minus 12,

00:24:51.852 --> 00:24:52.810
or something like that.

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:55.440
You can know where
in the distribution

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.580
that particular
supernova comes from.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.520
And that is what
makes these things

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.950
such great
standardizable candles.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.820
Sometimes astronomers call
them standard candles.

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.090
But I don't like that term.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:07.980
Standardizable is better.

00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:09.560
So we find these things.

00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.830
My job on both teams
that did this work was

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:14.160
to get spectra of them,
to get the redshifts

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.585
and to make sure they
were Type Ia supernovae.

00:25:16.585 --> 00:25:19.620
I used the Keck
telescopes for that work.

00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.570
And here's then the diagram
of the possibilities.

00:25:23.570 --> 00:25:26.970
And here is what we
found, this green curve.

00:25:26.970 --> 00:25:27.770
OK.

00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:31.640
Oops, none of the above,
folks, the answer that's

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.370
so attempting on
multiple choice exams.

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.970
That's where the data fell.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:40.870
And if this is sort of a dense
universe-- 1, greater than 1,

00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.950
1.3, 0-- it doesn't
take a genius

00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:46.430
to realize that
this curve formally

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.230
corresponds to a density
less than 0 for the universe.

00:25:50.230 --> 00:25:53.297
But that just doesn't
make any sense whatsoever,

00:25:53.297 --> 00:25:54.880
unless the other
parts of the universe

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.500
are made out of some wacky
stuff with negative mass.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.380
But we have no
indication whatsoever

00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.479
that that's the case.

00:26:00.479 --> 00:26:02.020
Fortunately, there
is an alternative.

00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.395
There is what's
called Einstein's

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:08.040
cosmological constant, which
now is just one subset of a more

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.340
general class of theories
called dark energy theories,

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.764
stuff that has a
positive energy density

00:26:14.764 --> 00:26:16.680
and actually has some
gravitational attraction

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.360
associated with it,
but it has what's

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:19.640
called a negative pressure.

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.280
And the negative
pressure is what

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.090
can accelerate the
expansion of the universe.

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.520
So by the end of
'98, no one had found

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.830
any flaws in what we had done.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:32.000
And so this was deemed by the
editors of "Science Magazine"

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.120
as the single greatest
breakthrough in all areas

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.131
of science that year.

00:26:35.131 --> 00:26:37.130
And so we were, obviously,
very pleased by that.

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:39.027
And Einstein is
surprised here not

00:26:39.027 --> 00:26:40.610
because there are
multiple universes--

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:41.569
though, there might be.

00:26:41.569 --> 00:26:42.985
Though, they don't
come from pipes

00:26:42.985 --> 00:26:44.240
of theoretical physicists.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.260
He's surprised because
this one universe

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:49.240
is expanding at an
accelerating rate, rather

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.560
than a decelerating rate.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:52.510
That's the bottom
line, is the data

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:55.530
imply acceleration,
rather than deceleration.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.422
And that's just really weird.

00:26:57.422 --> 00:26:59.380
And when you combine the
supernova measurements

00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:01.700
with measurements of the
cosmic microwave background

00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:04.300
radiation and other data,
then you figure out,

00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.270
basically, that the
dark energy that

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:09.181
is causing this repulsion,
whatever it is--

00:27:09.181 --> 00:27:10.930
and we don't know what
the dark energy is.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.310
It might be a property
of space itself,

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:15.110
the cosmological
constant, or it could be

00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:16.860
some new kind of energy field.

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:19.090
But whatever it is, it
actually constitutes

00:27:19.090 --> 00:27:22.000
70% of the total
contents of the universe.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.630
And we don't know what it is.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:26.020
And most of the
rest is dark matter

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:28.620
that holds galaxies and
clusters of galaxies together.

00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:29.480
But we can't see it.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.480
And we don't know, really,
what that is, either.

00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.150
Although, it's probably
little, tiny particles

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:35.350
left over from the Big Bang.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:36.410
But we're not sure.

00:27:36.410 --> 00:27:39.260
And the ordinary stuff, out
of which you and I and Google

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.630
are made, is only 5%.

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.870
And the easily visible stuff
is only half a percent.

00:27:43.870 --> 00:27:48.420
So if you're talking about
science to youngsters

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.087
and someone says to you, well,
they heard from their uncle

00:27:52.087 --> 00:27:53.670
or something that
there's nothing left

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:55.860
to be done in physics,
you tell that youngster,

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:59.960
what about the origin and
nature of 95% of the universe?

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.334
Pretty exciting stuff.

00:28:01.334 --> 00:28:03.000
And when I was a
student, we didn't even

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.030
know that these parts
of the pie existed.

00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:07.150
The whole pie was
ordinary matter.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:09.765
And that consists of 92
naturally-occurring elements.

00:28:09.765 --> 00:28:10.510
OK.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:13.910
So anyway, this was all
confirmed in the subsequent 13

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:19.430
years after 1998, at which
point the discovery was honored

00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:21.160
with a Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:24.080
And given the rules, it went
to the team leaders, Sal

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:26.730
Perlmutter at
Berkeley, Brian Schmidt

00:28:26.730 --> 00:28:28.740
at the Australian
National University--

00:28:28.740 --> 00:28:32.530
and I'm pleased to say that
the Nobel Committee did

00:28:32.530 --> 00:28:35.540
the right thing-- they gave
my post doctoral scholar, who

00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.110
was working with
me and with Brian,

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:40.200
but directly under my mentorship
at Berkeley at the time

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.840
that he made the
measurements-- He's

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.500
the first on Schmidt's
team to realize

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.990
what the data were telling us.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.619
These three gentlemen knew that
without the rest of us working

00:28:47.619 --> 00:28:50.160
in the trenches, they wouldn't
have been honored in this way.

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.993
So they spent a good
fraction of their prize

00:28:51.993 --> 00:28:55.200
money flying the rest of us
out to celebrate Nobel Week.

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.020
Here's right after the
awarding of the Nobel Prize

00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.110
to Schmidt and Riess.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.060
And here's the Supernova
Cosmology Project team.

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:03.970
I happen not to be
in this picture,

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:07.220
because their group picture
was taken right at the time

00:29:07.220 --> 00:29:09.220
that the high redshift
team, Schmidt's

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.440
team, my primary
affiliation, was

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.430
having its celebratory lunch.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:16.210
And at that lunch, Noelle,
my wife, who is here,

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.660
revealed a t-shirt
that she made--

00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.410
"Dark energy is the new black."

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.770
And that was our
consolation prize

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:26.290
for not winning the
Nobel Prize itself,

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.030
but for having done the work.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.890
And that was really the thrill,
is just having done the work.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.080
And never in my
wildest dreams as a kid

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.870
did I think that I
would be associated

00:29:34.870 --> 00:29:35.820
with such a discovery.

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:37.650
And so that's been
the real reward.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.297
It's just been the fun and
working with people and stuff.

00:29:40.297 --> 00:29:42.130
Nevertheless, it is
nice to get some credit.

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.660
And as Alvaro said,
more recently,

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:47.600
the 2015 Breakthrough Prize
in Fundamental Physics

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.010
specifically by name recognized
all of the participants, all 51

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:52.510
of them.

00:29:52.510 --> 00:29:53.610
And so that's really good.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.250
So there we go.

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:54.340
Yeah.

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:54.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:59.460
So anyway, specifically,
the Lick contributions

00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:03.980
were in the early 1990s showing
the spectroscopic diversity

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.950
of Type Ia supernovae.

00:30:05.950 --> 00:30:08.390
And then in the years
following the building

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:10.850
of the Katzman
telescope in 1998,

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.060
getting lots and lots of
light curves and stuff

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.310
and verifying this,
admittedly, not yet

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.650
well-verified discovery
that we announced in 1998.

00:30:20.650 --> 00:30:22.500
At some point, you've
just got to be brave.

00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.940
And if you think
you've done your work,

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.220
you have to announce
a discovery,

00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:27.303
even though you're not
sure that you're right yet.

00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:30.580
But the confirmation
of this light curve

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:33.380
shape versus luminosity
relationship with the Katzman

00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:37.180
telescope, so that
was something we did.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:41.460
Next big topic-- and one that I
personally don't work on, just

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.300
to show you that I'm really
being fair and egalitarian here

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:48.290
and stuff-- exoplanets, really
a hot field in astrophysics

00:30:48.290 --> 00:30:48.790
these days.

00:30:48.790 --> 00:30:51.400
Basically, are there
other planetary systems?

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.630
Are any of them like
our own solar system?

00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:55.840
Well, the way to
detect exoplanets

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.690
is not so much to see
their reflected light--

00:30:58.690 --> 00:31:00.890
because they're so dim
they're lost in the glare--

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:03.630
but rather to see the
effect they have on the star

00:31:03.630 --> 00:31:05.210
that they orbit,
or, more correctly,

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:07.610
the two orbit their
common center of mass.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:10.640
So when the planet is
going away from us,

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.680
the star will be
going toward us.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:14.640
And the light will
be blueshifted--

00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.432
by the way, not
instantaneously, of course.

00:31:16.432 --> 00:31:18.848
But the blueshifted part will
travel at the speed of light

00:31:18.848 --> 00:31:19.540
toward us.

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:20.940
That's a bit of a subtlety here.

00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.216
But anyway, no big deal.

00:31:23.216 --> 00:31:24.840
And when the planet
is going toward us,

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.339
the star will be
going away from us.

00:31:26.339 --> 00:31:28.727
And so you'll see these
periodic Doppler shifts.

00:31:28.727 --> 00:31:31.060
And you have to spread out
the spectrum a heck of a lot.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.830
So it's a high
dispersion spectrograph.

00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:34.680
And let's zoom in
on it and see what's

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:36.400
happening to these
absorption lines.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.020
So here's a little
magnifying glass.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.353
And we're going to look at
the absorption lines produced

00:31:40.353 --> 00:31:42.760
by the chemical elements in
the atmosphere of the star.

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.310
They shift back and forth.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.000
And you can measure
the changing flux

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.790
levels in these little pixels.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.400
And the shifts are typically
1/1,000 of a pixel.

00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.650
So we've exaggerated
the effect a lot here.

00:31:54.650 --> 00:31:56.660
But there are thousands
of absorption lines.

00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.920
If you use cross-correlation
techniques and stuff,

00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:02.960
you can measure speeds
that are basically walking

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.700
speed, meters per second.

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:05.800
It's unbelievable.

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.630
They're now down to
a meter per second.

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:09.950
But you need huge
amounts of time,

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:14.760
or on modest-size telescopes
to get enough data, right?

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.230
Measuring the star once or twice
is just not going to do it.

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:21.820
So here in the early 1990s,
Geoff Marcy and Paul Butler

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.570
using the Lick 3-meter telescope
made some measurements.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:28.160
They noticed that the star
wasn't standing still.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.640
And here's a periodic
function fit through it.

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:33.930
But they said, well, let's start
taking data more frequently,

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:35.180
and then really frequently.

00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:39.440
And you can see that there is
sort of a 0.7-year variability

00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:45.150
here in the velocity and
also a 4-year variability.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.390
And a 4.6-day variability
has been removed from this

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.840
presentation of the data.

00:32:49.840 --> 00:32:54.670
So Epsilon Andromedae has this
three-planet system where there

00:32:54.670 --> 00:32:58.060
is this 4-Jupiter-mass planet
way out here with a 4-year

00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:01.250
period-- the 4s
are coincidental--

00:33:01.250 --> 00:33:04.644
the 2-Jupiter-mass planet
with a period of 0.7 years,

00:33:04.644 --> 00:33:06.810
and then this little guy
here, which is actually not

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:10.330
so little, half a Jupiter mass
or so, with a 4.6-day orbital

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:11.090
period.

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:15.500
This is the beginning of
a very exciting new class

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.350
of planets called hot Jupiters.

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.570
This thing basically
has the mass of Jupiter,

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:22.480
yet it's orbiting the star
with an orbital period

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:24.709
of just a few days.

00:33:24.709 --> 00:33:26.000
It shouldn't have formed there.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.130
Jupiter is a big,
gaseous, liquid thing.

00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:30.520
Probably, it formed farther
out and then migrated in

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.090
through friction
with the accretion

00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:34.290
with the protoplanetary
disk or something.

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.640
But here's an artist's
impression of it.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.470
It may even be evaporating away.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:40.870
We have evidence of ones
that are evaporating away.

00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:42.420
Obviously, we don't
have any pictures

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:43.590
that are quite like this.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.957
But if anyone wants to
help build a telescope,

00:33:45.957 --> 00:33:46.790
if that's-- Anyway--

00:33:46.790 --> 00:33:47.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:47.980 --> 00:33:50.170
So anyway, you might
wonder, how do you

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:55.130
get actual parameters like the
orbital distance and the mass?

00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:58.230
So here's 51 Pegasi,
the one that was first

00:33:58.230 --> 00:34:00.480
found by a team of
Swiss astronomers

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:04.060
and then quickly verified
by Marcy and Butler.

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.370
Again, a 4.23-day
period in this case.

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.040
Well, the period is
4.23 days for 51 Pegasi

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.595
b, this little exoplanet.

00:34:12.595 --> 00:34:14.469
Kepler's law is that
the square of the period

00:34:14.469 --> 00:34:16.610
is proportional to the
cube of the distance,

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.389
and you have to divide
by the mass of the star.

00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:22.380
Oh, and by the way, the
constant of proportionality

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.679
is 1 when you use
these particular units.

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.700
You know the mass of the
star from its classification.

00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.550
We know stars
pretty well by now.

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:31.420
So you can solve for
R. And in this case,

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.750
it's 1/20 of Earth's orbital
distance from the sun.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.630
So this guy is just
screaming around this star

00:34:39.630 --> 00:34:43.790
with a mass of 0.45
Jupiter's divided by sine i.

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:46.909
And the factor of the sign
of the inclination angle

00:34:46.909 --> 00:34:50.780
is that you don't know what
the orbital inclination is

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:51.889
to your line of sight.

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.303
The really nice ones are the
ones that are 90 degrees.

00:34:54.303 --> 00:34:55.969
They're transiting
the Kepler satellite.

00:34:55.969 --> 00:34:56.856
Found some of those.

00:34:56.856 --> 00:34:58.730
There, you know that
the angle is 90 degrees.

00:34:58.730 --> 00:35:00.270
So sine of i is 1.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.480
But where you don't
know, you're only

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:05.710
seeing in the Doppler
effect, that component

00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:07.674
of the total velocity,
which is radial.

00:35:07.674 --> 00:35:09.090
You don't see the
transverse part.

00:35:09.090 --> 00:35:12.441
And that's why you get only
a lower limit for the mass.

00:35:12.441 --> 00:35:12.940
OK.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.180
So let's get the mass
now knowing the distance.

00:35:16.180 --> 00:35:19.700
So there we go.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.910
Conservation of
momentum-- M star V star

00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:23.230
is M planet V planet.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:25.955
The overall system is
just sitting there.

00:35:25.955 --> 00:35:27.400
Solve for the mass
of the planet.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.530
There we go.

00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:31.510
You know the mass of the
star from its classification.

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:34.680
You get the speed of the star
from the maximum Doppler shift,

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.720
55 meters per
second in this case.

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:39.830
What is the speed of the planet?

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:43.760
Well, I'll just do it
for circular orbits here.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:46.780
Circumference--
that total distance

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.420
is the speed times the period.

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:48.920
OK.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.820
And so you can solve for
the speed of the planet.

00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:54.274
And you know R. I just did
that on the previous slide.

00:35:54.274 --> 00:35:56.440
So the mass of the planet
in this case is about half

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.050
a Jupiter mass.

00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.830
So that's how you do it.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.250
For elliptical orbits, it's a
little bit more complicated.

00:36:00.250 --> 00:36:02.166
So the other big surprise
early on in the game

00:36:02.166 --> 00:36:05.740
was that instead of just having
nearly circular, only slightly

00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.040
eccentric orbits, as
in our solar system,

00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:11.240
a whole bunch of exoplanets
were found with these highly

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.360
eccentric orbits.

00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.090
And the signature
of such an orbit

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:17.360
is where you have a
periodic velocity curve,

00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:18.800
but it is not sinusoidal.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.300
OK.

00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.640
So this is clearly periodic.

00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.240
But what's happening
is the star's speed

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.300
reverses very, very quickly.

00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:28.040
And that's, of course,
when the planet

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.430
goes zipping around the star.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:33.000
The star's speed reverses very
quickly at that moment, too,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.701
because it goes
[VOCALIZING    ENGINE].

00:36:35.701 --> 00:36:37.450
And that's Kepler's
second law, of course.

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.750
So anyway, who among
you were students

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.220
in my Astro 10 class at Cal?

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:43.591
I know several of you were.

00:36:43.591 --> 00:36:45.590
OK, so I'm going to quiz
you on this afterwards.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:46.470
You'd better remember.

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.850
Otherwise, you'll
fail the class.

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.291
And your job at Google
will have been revoked.

00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:51.790
OK.

00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:55.019
So the big thing in the
early days-- and it's still

00:36:55.019 --> 00:36:57.310
interesting that more of
these things are being found--

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:02.020
are lots of hot Jupiters and
lots of these eccentric ones.

00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:04.190
Of course, more normal
ones have been found.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:06.600
And the Kepler satellite
has been wonderful recently

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.660
at finding transiting ones.

00:37:08.660 --> 00:37:11.660
But in the early days,
especially Paul Butler

00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:14.990
and Geoff Marcy-- Marcy's
a professor at Berkeley--

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.370
were the undisputed
leaders in this field.

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:21.330
They found 70 of the first
100 known exoplanets.

00:37:21.330 --> 00:37:23.630
And they did it with the
Lick 3-meter telescope.

00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:25.240
And that's still a
relevant telescope.

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.670
And they still are
among the leaders.

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:30.970
But back then, they found
most of these things.

00:37:30.970 --> 00:37:33.660
And in the early
'90s-- well, mid

00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:36.810
'90s, in this case-- when
two planets were found,

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:38.880
it made the cover
of "Time Magazine."

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.750
You know, "Dole
Drops, Clinton Rises."

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.230
Well, half of this might be
relevant for the next year

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.960
and a half or so.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.810
But anyway, "Is
Anybody Out There?--

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:47.560
How the Discovery of
Two Planets Brings Us

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.351
Closer to Solving the
Most Profound Mystery

00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:49.990
in the Cosmos."

00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:51.406
You know, is there
life out there?

00:37:51.406 --> 00:37:53.640
Is there intelligent life?

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.839
You might say we already
have published evidence

00:37:55.839 --> 00:37:58.380
that there really is, of course,
because look-- "Weekly World

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:00.190
News," "Alien Backs
Arnold for Governor."

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.720
I don't have to tell
this crowd not to believe

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.011
everything you read, of course.

00:38:03.011 --> 00:38:05.520
So anyway, so a lot of
those were hot Jupiters.

00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.470
Here's Lynette Cook's
artist's impression

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:09.310
of what one of these
things looks like.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:12.600
But the name of the game now
is we want to find Earths.

00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:15.940
And we want to find Earths in
the habitable or potentially

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:18.620
habitable zone, where
liquid water might exist

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:20.240
on the surface of the planet.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.590
So for that, you need
really huge amounts

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:24.460
of time on modest-size
telescopes,

00:38:24.460 --> 00:38:27.340
because though
Jupiter would produce

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:31.730
a signal of about 10
meters per second--

00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:34.760
if an alien were looking at
the sun, they would see the sun

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.050
moving around at a speed
of 10 meters per second

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.300
because of Jupiter.

00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:41.370
The reflex motion
caused by Earth

00:38:41.370 --> 00:38:44.610
is 10 centimeters per second.

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:48.110
So that's the motion of
the sun induced by Earth.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.320
So you really need a
lot of telescope time

00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.490
to dig the signal
out of the noise.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:54.240
And so Marcy said,
you, Filippenko, you're

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:57.410
using up too much of the 3-meter
for your studies of supernovae.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:39:00.805
So he built himself, along
with Steve Vogt at Santa Cruz,

00:39:00.805 --> 00:39:04.480
a 2.4-meter telescope, the
size of the Hubble, basically,

00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:07.170
that's dedicated to
looking for planets.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:10.590
And so they're looking at the
brightest stars in the sky.

00:39:10.590 --> 00:39:13.540
Sure everyone would like
the Lick's sky to be darker,

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.460
but it's not necessary
for all types of projects.

00:39:16.460 --> 00:39:17.480
And we live here.

00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:19.190
And that's just the way it goes.

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:20.842
But for naked-eye
stars, you hardly

00:39:20.842 --> 00:39:23.300
care about the sky brightness,
as long as the sun isn't up.

00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:25.175
And so, you know, I'm
being a bit facetious.

00:39:25.175 --> 00:39:27.050
But the point is you
can do this kind of work

00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:30.210
over and over again, look
at the same stars searching

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:31.830
for Earth-like planets.

00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:34.650
And here's Lauren Weiss,
one of our grad students,

00:39:34.650 --> 00:39:36.660
running this whole
system from Berkeley.

00:39:36.660 --> 00:39:37.880
And in fact, it's robotic.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:40.230
So really, what she's doing
is looking at the data

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:43.050
as the data are coming in,
monitoring for quality control,

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:45.340
that kind of thing, because
these systems are now

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:46.270
largely robotic.

00:39:46.270 --> 00:39:49.220
And the project
they're doing now

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.740
is to search for
Earth-like planets

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:56.350
among the nearest stars, the
roughly 100 stars that are

00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.300
within about 20 light years.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:01.150
Because if we can find
Earth-like exoplanets

00:40:01.150 --> 00:40:04.980
around those stars, well, that
might be a post, a signpost,

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:08.581
of where to look
if we seek Yoda.

00:40:08.581 --> 00:40:09.080
All right.

00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:13.590
Supermassive black holes,
my next science topic.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:15.420
A black hole is a
region where gravity

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.400
is so strong that nothing,
not even light, can escape.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.290
So apples can't escape.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:21.620
Rockets can't escape.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.180
Not even light can escape.

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:26.470
So here is my prize-winning
photograph of a black hole.

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:29.030
Yeah, you can just
choose a black background

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.850
in PowerPoint, or whatever,
put your lens cap on.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:34.020
"Abandon all hope,
ye who enter here!!,"

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.710
quoting from "Dante's
Inferno," of course.

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.920
They're pretty wild places.

00:40:37.920 --> 00:40:39.840
They suck you in, and
they don't let you out.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.670
So they're pretty ferocious.

00:40:41.670 --> 00:40:43.930
We have a saying, what
happens in a black hole

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.111
stays in a black hole.

00:40:46.111 --> 00:40:46.610
All right.

00:40:46.610 --> 00:40:48.735
Well, how do you detect
them if you don't see them?

00:40:48.735 --> 00:40:50.550
Again, by their
gravitational influence.

00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:53.230
This is essentially
like exoplanets.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.170
You can measure the
mass of an object.

00:40:55.170 --> 00:40:57.270
If you measure the
distance of something

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:00.570
orbiting it and
the orbital speed.

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:08.230
In the case of exoplanets, what
we used was a period and speed.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:09.920
And from that, we
got R. But as long

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.580
as you have two of
those variables,

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.740
you get the third one,
and you can get M.

00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.050
Anyway, we suspected
for a long time

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:20.580
that big black holes might
exist within an active galaxy.

00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.040
And an active galaxy
is like a normal galaxy

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:26.110
that has a concentration of
brightness near the center.

00:41:26.110 --> 00:41:27.800
But in an active
galaxy, the center

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:30.540
is unusually bright, as though
something very energetic

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:31.994
is going on inside.

00:41:31.994 --> 00:41:34.160
And you might think, why
would that be a black hole?

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:35.590
I just told you
that a black hole

00:41:35.590 --> 00:41:38.410
is a region from which
light does not escape.

00:41:38.410 --> 00:41:38.990
That's true.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.640
But if you have a black hole,
especially if it's spinning,

00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:43.710
and you've got an
accretion disk orbiting it,

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:45.720
then in the process
of falling in,

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.740
that material rubs against
neighboring material

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:52.480
and converts its
gravitational potential energy

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:55.890
and its bulk kinetic
energy into light.

00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:59.560
And that can be a very
efficient process,

00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.340
10 times more efficient than
nuclear energy, by the way.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:05.100
So that might be a place
where there is a black hole,

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.740
because you need a very
efficient release of energy

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.612
from a small region in the
middle of an active galaxy.

00:42:10.612 --> 00:42:12.820
So how do you prove that
there is a black hole there?

00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:15.620
Well, here is the spectrum of
light from an active galaxy.

00:42:15.620 --> 00:42:17.060
And you have several components.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:20.120
Here's the continuum that
comes from this accretion

00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.420
disk of material.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:23.230
And then you have
these emission lines.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:27.350
And the emission lines come in
two forms-- narrow and broad.

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:28.850
Here's some narrow ones.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.070
They come from gas
that's relatively far

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:32.320
from the putative black hole.

00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.520
And that gas isn't
moving very quickly.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:37.140
But there's also these
broad Balmer lines

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:39.590
of hydrogen, which
come from gas that's

00:42:39.590 --> 00:42:41.540
moving with speeds of
thousands of kilometers

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:46.120
per second very near
the putative black hole.

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.980
Well, so here's
sort of an anatomy

00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:49.950
of an active galactic nucleus.

00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:50.950
There is the black hole.

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:54.100
There is the accretion disk that
emits the continuum radiation.

00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:57.030
Here is this broad line
region where clouds of gas

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.130
are moving around very quickly,
producing those broad lines,

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:01.719
because some gas
is Doppler-shifted

00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:03.010
because it's moving toward you.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.350
Some of it is
Doppler-redshifted because it's

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.360
moving away from you.

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:09.190
That's what gives the breadth.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:13.799
So if you can measure the
motions of these clouds

00:43:13.799 --> 00:43:15.340
and if there is some
way to determine

00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:18.750
their distance from the
center, well, that's

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.070
a speed and a distance.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.530
That's what you need
to get the mass.

00:43:22.530 --> 00:43:26.030
Remember from that thing
that I just showed.

00:43:26.030 --> 00:43:26.570
All right.

00:43:26.570 --> 00:43:29.110
So well, the width
of the broad line--

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.680
here is hydrogen
data-- tells you

00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.530
something about the aggregate
orbital speeds of the clouds

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.190
in this broad line region.

00:43:35.190 --> 00:43:38.000
And if you measure how far these
clouds are from the black hole,

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.770
then you've got what you
need to solve for the mass.

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:43.430
Well, how do we do that?

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:45.270
We use a technique
called echo mapping.

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:46.130
Here's a nebula.

00:43:46.130 --> 00:43:47.580
This is called a
planetary nebula.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.996
It has nothing to
do with planets.

00:43:48.996 --> 00:43:52.780
But our own sun will do this
in about 5 or 6 billion years,

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:55.570
when it becomes a red
giant and the outer parts

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:58.270
of its atmosphere will
be only loosely held.

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.960
So the point is there
is a hot star here.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.530
And if you've got
ultraviolet radiation coming

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:07.590
from that hot star
or some other source,

00:44:07.590 --> 00:44:10.080
then it will ionize
the clouds of gas.

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.670
And if you have an increase
in the UV brightness

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:16.610
of this source, that will lead
to an increase in the emission

00:44:16.610 --> 00:44:19.750
line brightness of the
surrounding ionized gas.

00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:22.000
But if you're over
here somewhere,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.070
it will have taken
time for light

00:44:24.070 --> 00:44:27.530
to travel to the back side
and produce emission lines

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:29.260
and then to reach you.

00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:32.440
Whereas from the front side,
the continuum variation

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.260
and the emission
line variation will

00:44:34.260 --> 00:44:36.250
be essentially simultaneous.

00:44:36.250 --> 00:44:39.090
So the observer will
see a time delay

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.750
between changes
in the brightness

00:44:40.750 --> 00:44:42.920
of the central source
and the brightness

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:44.540
of the overall nebula.

00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:46.800
Different parts will
brighten at different times.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.870
But if they're
spatially unresolved,

00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:51.040
it just means there
will be an overall delay

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.070
in the brightening
of this nebula.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:56.730
So if we look at, say, a
step function continuum

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.520
variation of the
active nucleus, it

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.960
might look
intrinsically like this.

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.310
But the emission
line light curve

00:45:04.310 --> 00:45:06.740
will start brightening
at the time

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.460
that the continuum brightened
because the emission line

00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.150
clouds that are along
the line of sight

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:14.190
to the continuum source suffer
essentially no time delay.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.420
But there will be a
progressively bigger and bigger

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.540
time delay for all
these clouds here.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:23.130
And so the overall thing will
have this kind of a shape.

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.390
And that's how you get a measure
of the size of the system.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:28.780
So we measure the
continuum light curves

00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:31.440
with a telescope
like KAIT, where

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:33.170
you can get many,
many measurements

00:45:33.170 --> 00:45:34.710
over the course of time.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.260
We measure the
emission line light

00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.310
curves using a bigger
telescope, because you

00:45:39.310 --> 00:45:41.330
have to spread the light
out into a spectrum

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.720
and measure the
individual emission lines.

00:45:44.720 --> 00:45:47.200
But the point is you need
huge amounts of time, right?

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:48.699
You're not going
to do this with one

00:45:48.699 --> 00:45:51.220
or two measurements on the
world's biggest telescopes.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:56.430
This should be firmly affixed
to your brain at this point

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:57.390
through your retina.

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.050
And again, students and
postdocs are doing all this work

00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:03.190
remotely from the UC campuses.

00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:04.120
It's really great.

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:09.320
So what we've found for a
bunch of studies of galaxies--

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.180
and this overall study is led
by Aaron Barth of UC Irvine,

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.300
who is a former PhD student
of mine-- is we indeed

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.800
find evidence, as have
other astronomers-- again,

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.430
none of what I'm saying
is unique to our group.

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:24.410
But what we found
is there really

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:28.060
are big black holes in the
centers of these galaxies,

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:30.570
as shown by these data
that we've gathered.

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:33.800
And so this theoretical picture
that was proposed 50 years ago

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:35.070
appears to be correct.

00:46:35.070 --> 00:46:38.690
And Einstein never thought
that black holes actually

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:39.850
occur in nature.

00:46:39.850 --> 00:46:42.630
He was aware that they are a
possible theoretical prediction

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.910
consistent with his general
theory of relativity.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.600
But he didn't think
that nature has

00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:48.140
any way of making black holes.

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:51.050
Well, imagine what his reaction
would be if he were alive now

00:46:51.050 --> 00:46:53.480
and could see the evidence
that we and others have

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.730
found for black holes.

00:46:54.730 --> 00:46:57.860
I mean, his reaction might
be something like this.

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.820
Finally, technology development.

00:46:59.820 --> 00:47:01.260
There, we do lots of things.

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.810
We make and test new equipment
on smaller telescopes,

00:47:05.810 --> 00:47:07.330
where the time
isn't so precious.

00:47:07.330 --> 00:47:09.520
And then we move it over
to other telescopes.

00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.310
And the one application
I want to focus on,

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.680
given limited time, is laser
guide star adaptive optics.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.680
When you look at stars
through a telescope,

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:18.826
they look smeared out.

00:47:18.826 --> 00:47:20.200
And this is related
to twinkling,

00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.167
because the different
light rays are

00:47:22.167 --> 00:47:24.500
passing through different
pockets in Earth's atmosphere,

00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:26.610
having different
indices of refraction

00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:29.570
because of different humidity,
temperature, density,

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:30.400
and so on.

00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.870
And so all these little
pockets are moving around.

00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:36.250
And that causes the star
to twinkle and to blur out.

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.650
You'd like it to look like a
point, like my laser point.

00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:41.910
But if you look at it
hundreds of times a second,

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:44.040
it looks like this thing
that, averaged over time,

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.120
becomes all smeared out, smeared
into something big like this.

00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.010
So we'd like it
to look like that.

00:47:51.010 --> 00:47:53.700
Well, if you measure
the incoming wavefronts

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.970
hundreds of times per second
with a wavefront sensor

00:47:57.970 --> 00:48:00.940
and then you send
appropriate corrections

00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:03.780
to a small,
deformable mirror, you

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.280
can deform the
shape of the mirror

00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:09.620
such that when the
wave front hits it,

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:12.590
it'll hit with exactly
the same shape.

00:48:12.590 --> 00:48:15.060
And that will then
turn a distorted wave

00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:17.342
into a plane-parallel
wave once again.

00:48:17.342 --> 00:48:18.050
You can see this.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:22.000
If this shape is exactly the
same as whatever wavefront

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.040
is hitting it,
then what comes out

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.330
will be a plane-parallel
wave again.

00:48:26.330 --> 00:48:27.050
It's fantastic.

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:30.780
And if you do this hundreds
of times per second,

00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:34.660
then, in fact, you can
get a nice, sharp image.

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.250
So your image will
be sharp not only

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:40.380
for the star that
you've corrected,

00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:43.090
but for a small patch
of the sky next to it.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:45.340
So suppose you want
to study this galaxy

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:47.874
and you've got, conveniently,
a bright star next to it.

00:48:47.874 --> 00:48:49.790
You make the measurements
of this bright star,

00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:51.831
correct it to make it look
like a point of light,

00:48:51.831 --> 00:48:54.250
like my laser pointer,
and then the correction

00:48:54.250 --> 00:48:57.390
will apply essentially
equally well to the galaxy.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:48:59.465
And that fuzzy thing
will turn into that.

00:48:59.465 --> 00:49:01.090
That's the kind of
improvement you get.

00:49:01.090 --> 00:49:03.250
Now, full disclosure--
this is actually

00:49:03.250 --> 00:49:05.610
a Hubble picture of that.

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:07.200
And it's not that galaxy.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:09.547
But I couldn't find
the matching pair.

00:49:09.547 --> 00:49:11.380
I don't know that this
particular galaxy has

00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:14.230
been imaged in this way,
because, in principle, what I'm

00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:16.690
telling you is absolutely
true, even though you

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:19.010
might be thinking, Alex just
showed us a Hubble picture

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:20.521
and he implied
that this was taken

00:49:20.521 --> 00:49:21.770
with a ground-based telescope.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.320
So full disclosure.

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:26.680
Well, most galaxies and
other objects in the sky

00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.580
don't happen to have a bright
star conveniently located next

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:30.080
to them.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:31.371
Maybe this one is close enough.

00:49:31.371 --> 00:49:32.630
But all these others are not.

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:37.580
So what we do is we create
a fake or correction

00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:41.690
star with a laser beam that
excites a layer of sodium atoms

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:42.940
about 100 kilometers up.

00:49:42.940 --> 00:49:45.740
They're deposited there by
micrometeorites and stuff.

00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:49.780
And that whole system was
developed and perfected

00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:53.880
by Professor Claire Max, who
had an appointment at Livermore.

00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:57.990
And much of this
technology was classified

00:49:57.990 --> 00:49:59.460
until the Cold War ended.

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.790
And then she started
applying it to astronomy.

00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.170
So this whole thing was
developed and perfected

00:50:04.170 --> 00:50:07.300
at the Lick 3-meter telescope,
moved to the Keck telescopes.

00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:10.310
And the Kecks are now the
undeniable world champions

00:50:10.310 --> 00:50:12.800
at laser guide star
adaptive optics.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:16.820
And why debug and
fix screws and stuff

00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.130
on new instruments
on telescopes where

00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:20.450
the time is really precious?

00:50:20.450 --> 00:50:23.870
Keck time is worth
$100,000 a night, OK?

00:50:23.870 --> 00:50:25.292
So you don't want
to do it there.

00:50:25.292 --> 00:50:27.750
You want to do it at a place
where it doesn't cost so much.

00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:30.180
So let me show you some results.

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.760
Io, one of the moons of
Jupiter, before adaptive optics

00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:36.820
and after adaptive optics, the
most volcanically active body

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:38.660
known in the solar system.

00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.610
Uranus, the seventh planet.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:44.420
That is the correct
pronunciation for all those

00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.660
above the age of seven or eight.

00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.120
And after adaptive optics.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.480
You can see not only the
ring, but the development

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:54.110
of storm systems,
which could end up

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.650
someday helping us to
understand Earth's atmosphere.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.480
And then one of my
favorites, the center

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.120
of our galaxy in
the constellation

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.180
Sagittarius before and
after adaptive optics.

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.560
And this is work done by
Professor Andrea Gessa's group

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.790
at UCLA.

00:51:07.790 --> 00:51:10.980
And her group and that of
Reinhard Genzel at Berkeley

00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:16.010
and Max Planck have shown that
the central stars are zipping

00:51:16.010 --> 00:51:17.840
around in Keplerian
orbits-- that

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:21.570
means they're dominated by a
single, point-like mass-- whose

00:51:21.570 --> 00:51:23.890
location is marked
by this red cross.

00:51:23.890 --> 00:51:26.550
And the mass within there,
using Newton's laws,

00:51:26.550 --> 00:51:30.080
is 4 million solar masses
within a volume no larger

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:31.900
than that of our solar system.

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:34.390
And so the conservative
explanation

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.760
is that this is a black hole,
a supermassive black hole.

00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:38.630
This is the single
best piece of evidence.

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:40.230
By the way, I should
get an update.

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:42.980
They now have a complete orbit
for this one here spanning

00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:43.530
two decades.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:44.780
And I love this one coming in.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:45.160
Look at this.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.659
Watch.

00:51:45.659 --> 00:51:47.540
It goes, zoom!

00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.510
That's a great one.

00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:52.130
That's the one that gives the
tightest constraints, actually.

00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:54.320
So that's really fantastic
technology development.

00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.610
And then, finally-- I
lied-- public outreach,

00:51:56.610 --> 00:51:58.480
an important aspect
of what we do

00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.570
and something that Google
is very interested in.

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:04.470
This is the primary base
for UC astronomy education

00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:06.030
and outreach efforts.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.920
We have more than 20,000
visitors per year.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.576
I mean, yeah, some
people go to Hawaii.

00:52:10.576 --> 00:52:12.700
But usually, they're sipping
Mai Tais on the beach,

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.430
as they probably
should in Hawaii.

00:52:14.430 --> 00:52:17.994
A few make it up to the summit
of Mauna Kea, but not many.

00:52:17.994 --> 00:52:19.160
So we have lots of visitors.

00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:22.020
We have a hallway with exhibits,
where various jokers describe

00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:24.890
what they're doing,
and a summer visitor

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:27.970
program with lots and
lots of volunteers.

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.560
In fact, there are
volunteers even in this room.

00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.100
It's a fantastic thing.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:34.570
You can sign up.

00:52:34.570 --> 00:52:36.100
During the summers,
we have nights

00:52:36.100 --> 00:52:39.160
where you can view through
the great James Lick refractor

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:42.080
with this dead guy underneath
your feet-- not right

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.760
underneath your feet, but
underneath the base of the pier

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:45.260
here.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:47.330
So just go to ucolick.org.

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:52.450
And these programs are
free, or for a nominal cost.

00:52:52.450 --> 00:52:54.970
This type of work inspires
youth, sparks interest.

00:52:54.970 --> 00:52:55.940
It's really fantastic.

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.500
We have amateurs who set up
their telescopes in the parking

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.110
lot, thus we're able to
serve even more people.

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:03.910
By the way, my good friend,
Mike Hanna, from grade school

00:53:03.910 --> 00:53:08.050
is one of the volunteers at
Lick, as was-- your name?

00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:08.880
Who introduced me?

00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:09.379
Ar--

00:53:09.379 --> 00:53:10.080
AUDIENCE: Here.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:11.930
ALEX FILIPPENKO:
Yes, but-- Alberto?

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.020
ALVARO: Alvaro.

00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:14.120
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Alvar--

00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.745
ALVARO: Alvaro.

00:53:14.815 --> 00:53:15.170
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Alvaro.

00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.985
OK, Alvaro.

00:53:15.985 --> 00:53:17.770
Alvaro is a volunteer,
as well, right?

00:53:17.770 --> 00:53:18.270
ALVARO: Yes.

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:19.340
ALEX FILIPPENKO:
Yes, for 12 years.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.120
Anyway, thank you, Alvaro.

00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.040
Thank you, Michael.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.880
Any other volunteers
here in the crowd?

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.190
OK Well, anyway,
it's just fantastic.

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:30.460
And then my good friends,
Dan Zevin and Laura Peticolas

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:33.370
and their associates at
the Space Sciences Lab

00:53:33.370 --> 00:53:36.650
running what was called the
Center for Science Education.

00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:38.390
But they've now
renamed themselves

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:41.500
in a much more interesting
way-- the Multiverse.

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.780
They've set up a thing with
a partnership with the UC

00:53:43.780 --> 00:53:45.490
observatories and
Lick where they

00:53:45.490 --> 00:53:49.100
train teachers on how data are
taken and how to analyze data.

00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.970
And then those teachers
bring that knowledge

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:51.990
to their classroom.

00:53:51.990 --> 00:53:55.090
It turns out teachers are
not generally taught how

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:56.720
data are taken and utilized.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.040
And so now they can do this.

00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.850
And they can teach
their students

00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.650
and bring real data
to their classrooms

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:02.920
and talk to astronomers.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:04.910
And so the multiplicative
factor is fantastic.

00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:07.310
So Laura and Dan, thank
you so much for doing this.

00:54:07.310 --> 00:54:09.620
So what I hope I've
shown you is that we

00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:12.420
have been vital for
research for over 100 years.

00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:16.130
We continue doing research,
especially that kind that

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:20.370
requires large amounts of
time on small or modest-size

00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:21.520
telescopes.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:24.060
We design new instruments
and techniques

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:26.180
for use at Lick and elsewhere.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:28.090
And even grad
students and postdocs,

00:54:28.090 --> 00:54:31.190
like Sloan [? Victorovich ?]
here, can design instruments.

00:54:31.190 --> 00:54:33.940
And boy, people like
this are in hot demand.

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.250
You know, observers like
me are a dime a dozen.

00:54:36.250 --> 00:54:38.560
And pencil-pushing theorists
are a dime a dozen.

00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.730
But someone who knows
how to design and build

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:44.470
instruments and use them
for scientific work, that's

00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:48.360
a dying breed, in part
because too few universities

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.070
have access to their
own private facilities

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.680
where this kind of
work can be done.

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.640
And the big telescopes--
Hubble and James Webb

00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:58.090
and 30-meter and
places like that-- it's

00:54:58.090 --> 00:54:59.670
just very hard for
a student to be

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:01.990
involved in a meaningful way.

00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:04.330
But here, they design and
build new instruments.

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:06.140
And fantastic.

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:07.830
Hands-on training
for grad students,

00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.090
undergrads, and postdocs.

00:55:09.090 --> 00:55:11.940
And through early
exposure to research,

00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:15.940
these people become future
leaders in many, many fields.

00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:18.747
Again, I emphasize that
especially our undergrads,

00:55:18.747 --> 00:55:20.330
and to some degree,
our grad students,

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:23.470
but especially our undergrads
mostly do not go on

00:55:23.470 --> 00:55:25.460
to become PhD astrophysicists.

00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.950
They go on in computer science,
bio physics, medical physics,

00:55:28.950 --> 00:55:33.121
computer science, engineering,
applied physics-- future

00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:33.620
leaders.

00:55:33.620 --> 00:55:38.570
But they get their training as
undergrads in labs like this.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:40.780
Very important point--
grad students and postdocs

00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:43.860
can be principal investigators
on projects at Lick.

00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.930
That means they are in charge.

00:55:45.930 --> 00:55:50.620
They conceive, design, conduct,
and write up the whole project

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:53.700
with only occasional kibitzing
from me if they need it.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.570
That's different from the
initial apprenticeship they do,

00:55:56.570 --> 00:56:00.730
where they help me with a
project I've largely designed

00:56:00.730 --> 00:56:02.510
and maybe even have
taken data for.

00:56:02.510 --> 00:56:04.310
That's an important
part of their training.

00:56:04.310 --> 00:56:07.370
But equally, if not more
important, is to set them loose

00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:10.230
and let them become real
leaders in their fields

00:56:10.230 --> 00:56:13.300
by making mistakes, by
designing and conducting

00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:15.360
their own projects.

00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:18.200
They can't do that at Keck
with the 30-meter, if and when

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:19.620
it gets built.

00:56:19.620 --> 00:56:21.260
Public education
and outreach-- this

00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:23.390
is a unique, historic
Bay Area treasure.

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:26.740
We love doing this kind of
stuff for the general public.

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:30.420
But a couple of years ago, the
UC Office of the President,

00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.220
financially strapped,
as UC is, decided

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:37.920
to ramp down funding to
Lick by the summer of 2018.

00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.140
That's a bad idea.

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.500
And so a bunch of us spent
some time educating them

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:45.220
about what it is we do
at UC Lick Observatory,

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.599
especially for students.

00:56:46.599 --> 00:56:48.140
And if it's not in
students, then why

00:56:48.140 --> 00:56:50.196
does the university exist?

00:56:50.196 --> 00:56:51.570
We're not the
Princeton Institute

00:56:51.570 --> 00:56:54.180
for Advanced Study, where
they just sit and do research.

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:56.060
Our mission is also to educate.

00:56:56.060 --> 00:56:58.140
And this is where the
students get educated.

00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.840
So we taught them.

00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.560
And there was a
big public outcry.

00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.350
And we were successful.

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:06.812
In October of 2014,
they recanted.

00:57:06.812 --> 00:57:09.270
They said they were going to
provide partial funding-- only

00:57:09.270 --> 00:57:12.430
partial because the UC
system is heavily stressed.

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:14.870
The economy of California
is heavily stressed.

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:16.790
And everyone has to do
some belt tightening.

00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:20.600
But this was so important to
get their partial support,

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.210
OK, really very, very important.

00:57:22.210 --> 00:57:24.480
We really turned a
big corner there.

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.910
And in December of 2014, Google,
through Google Making Science,

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:33.780
gave this fantastic gift of half
a million a year for two years,

00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:37.470
I'm hoping just the beginning
of a long, long relationship.

00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:41.700
Let's call this
the courtship time.

00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:43.430
And we now, at
Berkeley and elsewhere,

00:57:43.430 --> 00:57:46.810
are trying to raise funds
to match that to leverage

00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:47.720
their big donation.

00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:49.640
And really, there's
nothing like a stamp

00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:51.970
of approval behind a
place like Google, right?

00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.480
Others who are on
the fence or maybe

00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:54.700
haven't heard much
about the project,

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:56.320
they say, oh, Google
is supporting it.

00:57:56.320 --> 00:57:58.361
Well, it's got to be pretty
good, then, you know.

00:57:58.361 --> 00:58:01.440
And so it's made a world of
difference, that and the UC

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:01.990
funding.

00:58:01.990 --> 00:58:03.740
So we've really turned a corner.

00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.640
We're not out of the
woods yet completely.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.670
But I'm very optimistic now.

00:58:07.670 --> 00:58:10.820
So thank you, Google, and
especially my colleagues

00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:12.070
here at Google Making Science.

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:13.640
I know Chris DiBona isn't here.

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.660
But maybe he'll
watch this lecture.

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:18.620
Those of you who
see him, tell him

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.480
that I really am
so, so grateful.

00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:23.750
And you might ask, well, what's
in it for Google, after all?

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:27.500
Well, first of all, I would
say it's two main things--

00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:31.820
help kids get interested
in science and technology.

00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:33.656
Astronomy is the
gateway science.

00:58:36.270 --> 00:58:38.660
Kids love the Hubble
images and all these kind

00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.070
of cosmic discoveries.

00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:41.800
And they then learn
more about science.

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:44.420
And they're more likely
then to pursue careers

00:58:44.420 --> 00:58:47.570
in science and technology
in almost all cases,

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.710
not as astrophysicists.

00:58:49.710 --> 00:58:50.490
That's OK.

00:58:50.490 --> 00:58:54.110
But the hook was, as
kids, what they saw.

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:56.390
And the long-term
future of Google

00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:58.480
and other high tech
companies like this

00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:01.190
depends on getting today's
kids interested in science

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:02.650
and technology.

00:59:02.650 --> 00:59:05.200
And the second, of course,
at a more advanced level,

00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.720
10 years later, helping students
get real research experience,

00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.270
like in my research
group and stuff.

00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:13.910
We now have Google
research scholars.

00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:16.400
I need to discuss with you
exactly what the name should

00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.750
be so as not to step
on anyone else's toes.

00:59:18.750 --> 00:59:20.680
But these are students
who are getting

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:25.250
real exposure to
research and data

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:27.240
and data analysis and computers.

00:59:27.240 --> 00:59:29.570
And they just get so jazzed.

00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:31.120
And these are
valuable skills, then,

00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.550
for the future in
the high-tech world.

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:37.340
So I would say those are
probably the two main aspects

00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:39.570
of Google Making Science.

00:59:39.570 --> 00:59:41.576
At least, that's what
I would think they are.

00:59:41.576 --> 00:59:43.200
And there are probably
others, as well.

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:46.770
It's a great new subdivision,
or whatever you call it here.

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:50.240
And we're continuing to discuss
ways in which we can mutually

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:53.620
benefit each other and do
things that will bring science

00:59:53.620 --> 00:59:57.790
to the general public and more
to the universities, as well.

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:01.560
So we spend about $2
million a year, maybe $1.5

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:04.790
just to keep going and another
half to $1 million to improve.

01:00:04.790 --> 01:00:06.970
So let's just call
it $2 million a year.

01:00:06.970 --> 01:00:09.400
Your support would
help Lick thrive.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.500
And Google's support already is.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.370
So as the UC Office
of the President,

01:00:13.370 --> 01:00:14.930
you can do so in two ways.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:17.720
You can become a friend of Lick
Observatory, an organization

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.650
of which I'm the
chairman of the board.

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:22.920
And you can make-- perhaps
more significant-- tax

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:27.030
deductible donations to the
UC Berkeley Lick Observatory

01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:28.050
Operations Fund.

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:31.120
And online, all you need to
do is use your favorite search

01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:34.030
engine to search
for "Give to Cal."

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.586
And then put "Lick"
in the little box

01:00:36.586 --> 01:00:38.210
there, and it'll show
you how to do it.

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:41.330
And in case you need the
foundation tax ID number,

01:00:41.330 --> 01:00:43.250
there it is.

01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:45.390
Anyway, so that's that.

01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:46.960
And then I have
three video courses

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:50.110
that happen to be available
online at 70% off.

01:00:50.110 --> 01:00:52.800
I checked last night
from The Great Courses.

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.280
So thank you very much.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:57.158
And I'll be happy
to answer questions.

01:00:57.158 --> 01:01:00.476
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:04.900
OK, yes.

01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:06.350
Right there.

01:01:06.350 --> 01:01:07.730
AUDIENCE: You
showed on the slide

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.015
about the Type Ia supernovae--

01:01:09.015 --> 01:01:09.890
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yes.

01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:13.650
AUDIENCE: --and how luminosity
decreases more slowly

01:01:13.650 --> 01:01:15.115
with time for a
larger explosion.

01:01:15.115 --> 01:01:15.990
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yes.

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:17.789
AUDIENCE: And I don't
know why that is.

01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:18.830
And I'd love to hear why.

01:01:18.830 --> 01:01:19.746
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:01:19.746 --> 01:01:23.960
What is the physics behind the
peak luminosity decline rate

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.490
correlation in Type Ia's?

01:01:26.490 --> 01:01:27.780
Here is the point.

01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:32.420
It turns out that, for reasons
we don't yet fully understand,

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:34.730
the thermonuclear
runaway in a Type Ia

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:40.030
can produce different amounts of
radioactive nickel, nickel-56.

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:43.080
Nickel-56 is four helium
nuclei squished together.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:45.300
You tend to get multiples
of helium nuclei.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.520
Carbon is three of them.

01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:48.100
Oxygen is four of them.

01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:51.270
Nickel is 14 of them.

01:01:51.270 --> 01:01:53.340
And this nickel-56
is radioactive.

01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:58.450
It decays to cobalt-56 and then
to iron-56, which is stable.

01:01:58.450 --> 01:02:01.030
That's what causes
the supernova to glow.

01:02:01.030 --> 01:02:03.370
It's the decay of the nickel.

01:02:03.370 --> 01:02:04.790
That's what causes it to glow.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:09.360
But if you make more nickel,
then you heat the ejecta more.

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.650
And that changes their opacity.

01:02:11.650 --> 01:02:14.420
It makes the ejected
gases more opaque.

01:02:14.420 --> 01:02:17.560
So the photons that are
generated by radioactive decay

01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:22.256
rattle around inside for a
longer time before escaping.

01:02:22.256 --> 01:02:24.380
Now, of course, what produces
the different amounts

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:25.112
of nickel?

01:02:25.112 --> 01:02:26.320
That, we're still working on.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:28.240
But that's part of
what makes science fun.

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.350
Possibly slight differences
in chemical composition,

01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:33.630
possibly slight
differences in temperature,

01:02:33.630 --> 01:02:35.990
which would occur
as a result of white

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:38.340
dwarfs forming with a
different initial mass,

01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:40.920
depending on the mass of the
star from which they formed.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.461
AUDIENCE: My question
is, do you have

01:02:42.461 --> 01:02:45.730
any explanation for the
formation of elliptical orbits

01:02:45.730 --> 01:02:46.680
in exoplanets?

01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:46.900
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:49.200
Elliptical orbits in
exoplanets-- great question.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.400
The prevailing theory
is that early on, there

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.310
are more big bodies
than there are now

01:02:55.310 --> 01:02:57.070
in most planetary systems.

01:02:57.070 --> 01:02:59.590
And early gravitational
interactions

01:02:59.590 --> 01:03:03.790
can, in some cases,
fling one planet out.

01:03:03.790 --> 01:03:07.030
And the other then will be left
in a highly eccentric orbit.

01:03:07.030 --> 01:03:09.550
And this occurs after the
disk has cleared away.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:11.960
And so there is no
real frictional drag

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:14.940
against the gas that would
circularize the orbit.

01:03:14.940 --> 01:03:18.460
But because of this
mechanism, in part because

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:21.090
of so many eccentric
exoplanets we see,

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:23.720
we now think that there
is just a giant number

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.670
of rogue exoplanets wandering
around in the Milky Way galaxy

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:34.230
and in other galaxies without
orbiting a star any longer.

01:03:34.230 --> 01:03:37.360
And some may have formed
just alone as it is.

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.430
But at the very least,
we know that some

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:41.490
must have been flung
out, because we

01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.210
see the remaining planet with
this highly eccentric orbit.

01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:46.380
Yeah.

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:49.420
AUDIENCE: Since you uncorked
the mystery of dark energy,

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.930
can you talk about, where is
the research on that going?

01:03:51.930 --> 01:03:52.140
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:54.710
So where is the research
on dark energy going now?

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:57.600
So we're approaching it
from a number of fronts.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:02.890
Basically, we need to
constrain its observed effects

01:04:02.890 --> 01:04:06.650
more in order to rule
out certain hypotheses.

01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:10.770
And so my own group is trying
to more accurately trace

01:04:10.770 --> 01:04:13.650
the expansion history
of the universe

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:17.460
and to see which of the models
is ruled out by the data.

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:19.740
We can never prove
that a particular model

01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:22.670
is the only one that
uniquely represents the data.

01:04:22.670 --> 01:04:24.960
But we can rule out ones.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.870
And so yes, we now
know that the universe

01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:30.740
is expanding faster than
it was 5 billion years ago.

01:04:30.740 --> 01:04:33.570
And we have even
measured 15 years ago

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.450
the early deceleration.

01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:38.840
So the universe for its first 9
billion years was slowing down.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.940
And about 5 billion
years ago, dark energy

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:44.140
started to become more
dominant than the dark matter,

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:45.840
and so it started accelerating.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:48.340
So decelerating,
then accelerating.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.690
But that's two or
three broad lumps.

01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:54.420
What was it doing 1
billion years ago?

01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:58.050
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12?

01:04:58.050 --> 01:05:00.010
What was the behavior?

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:04.587
That kind of expansion
history, in other words--

01:05:04.587 --> 01:05:06.170
I could go back--
but it's that curve.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:08.180
We're trying to define
what that curve is.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.040
That helps rule out
certain hypotheses.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.030
On other fronts,
people are looking at,

01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:14.550
for example, the
formation of what's

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:16.840
called large-scale structure.

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:19.710
Galaxies and clusters of
galaxies and superclusters

01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:22.360
and the voids
between them all grew

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.330
as a result of tiny, little
density fluctuations that

01:05:25.330 --> 01:05:29.560
were imprinted upon the
universe by quantum fluctuations

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:32.290
when the universe was a tiny
fraction of a second old.

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:36.110
And then they were blown into
spatially big fluctuations

01:05:36.110 --> 01:05:38.130
by this process
called inflation.

01:05:38.130 --> 01:05:40.130
Then the slightly
over dense regions

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:42.240
collected material from
their surroundings,

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.390
stealing from the
less dense regions.

01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:46.780
Well, you can run
computer simulations

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.120
of how that occurs
with different amounts

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.020
of dark matter, dark
energy, and different forms

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:54.450
of this repulsion
for the dark energy

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.250
and see which of the
computer simulations

01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:01.230
end up looking most
like the observations.

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.690
And then the other big field is
microwave background radiation.

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:10.180
By measuring the fluctuations
in the temperature, which

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:12.470
correspond to fluctuations
in the density

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:17.330
of the early universe, you
can set incredible constraints

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:18.660
on all kinds of things.

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:21.230
And if you want to look this
up, the Planck satellite

01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:24.917
is the most recent
incarnation of the greatest

01:06:24.917 --> 01:06:26.000
microwave background data.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.040
And prior to that, WMAP-- the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:33.850
Probe-- years 1, 3,
5, 7, and 9 gave us

01:06:33.850 --> 01:06:37.600
progressively better and
better maps and power density

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.730
spectra-- that is, the
amplitude of the fluctuations

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:42.750
versus their spatial scale.

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.740
That spectrum tells you
a giant amount of stuff

01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:48.430
about how much dark matter
there is, how much dark energy,

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:50.700
and even what kinds of
dark energy there might be.

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.020
So those are three of the main
ways in which we're probing

01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.370
what the dark energy might be.

01:06:55.370 --> 01:06:57.190
Yes.

01:06:57.190 --> 01:06:59.819
AUDIENCE: If we're in the sort
of expand-contract universe

01:06:59.819 --> 01:07:01.360
that you were talking
about earlier--

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.140
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:07:02.140 --> 01:07:03.350
AUDIENCE: It would
be implicit, I guess,

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.640
that this might not be the
first time this has happened.

01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:05.740
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:07.781
AUDIENCE: Who knows how
many times it's happened?

01:07:07.781 --> 01:07:10.180
This universe could have
been many times before.

01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:12.250
But if, as it seems
more likely, we

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.030
are in one that's
ever-expanding,

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.132
does that have any
implication for, this is

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.340
the first time it's happened?

01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.800
Or, who knows, it
could mean anything?

01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:19.770
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:21.980
Basically, I would
say still anything

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:25.420
goes, because we don't know
what the dark energy is.

01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:28.630
The historical
precedent is that there

01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:31.860
was a dark energy-like
substance, called the inflaton,

01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:35.220
that inflated the
universe in the first 10

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:38.140
trillionths of a trillionth of
a trillionth of a second-- 10

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:40.260
to the minus 35 seconds.

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:43.670
That was an accelerated,
indeed an exponential phase,

01:07:43.670 --> 01:07:45.170
of expansion of
our early universe.

01:07:45.170 --> 01:07:46.970
It's what made the universe big.

01:07:46.970 --> 01:07:51.010
But that dark energy,
that inflaton turned off.

01:07:51.010 --> 01:07:53.641
We think it decayed
from a substance

01:07:53.641 --> 01:07:55.140
with a negative
pressure-- which has

01:07:55.140 --> 01:07:57.080
this weird relativistic
effect of causing

01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:00.770
an accelerated expansion--
it decayed into normal stuff.

01:08:00.770 --> 01:08:03.450
And indeed I'm glad you asked
this question, because it gives

01:08:03.450 --> 01:08:06.330
me an excuse to tell
you that each of us--

01:08:06.330 --> 01:08:09.890
you, me, all of you--
contributed to the Big

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:13.720
Bang itself inflation because
you consist of material

01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:15.595
that used to be the inflaton.

01:08:15.595 --> 01:08:16.470
Can you believe that?

01:08:16.470 --> 01:08:20.437
So you contributed
to the Big Bang,

01:08:20.437 --> 01:08:22.270
if the "Bang" of the
Big Bang was inflation,

01:08:22.270 --> 01:08:25.399
which I and many
people feel is probably

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:28.620
the correct view of the early
history of the universe.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:32.052
So with that historical
precedent of the dark energy

01:08:32.052 --> 01:08:34.260
back then turning into stuff
that was gravitationally

01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:37.242
attractive, it's conceivable
that today's dark energy

01:08:37.242 --> 01:08:39.200
will someday become
gravitationally attractive,

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:40.000
as well.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.100
And in that case, if there
is enough of it-- and there,

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:46.350
we don't know which side of
the dividing line of omega

01:08:46.350 --> 01:08:49.810
equals 1 are we on--
if there's enough of it

01:08:49.810 --> 01:08:51.710
and it becomes
gravitationally attractive,

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.880
then someday, the universe
will start slowing down,

01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:57.310
come to a stop,
and reverse itself.

01:08:57.310 --> 01:08:59.930
But if the total
amount of dark energy

01:08:59.930 --> 01:09:05.330
is slightly below omega
of 1, 0.9999, then

01:09:05.330 --> 01:09:08.680
even if it becomes
gravitationally attractive,

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.140
the universe will continue
to expand forever.

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.420
So we just don't know.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:16.529
And I, unfortunately, don't know
of any way we will ever know.

01:09:16.529 --> 01:09:18.229
And this is for a subtle reason.

01:09:18.229 --> 01:09:20.090
Here it is.

01:09:20.090 --> 01:09:23.170
Our observable universe
is just a small part

01:09:23.170 --> 01:09:24.310
of what we think there is.

01:09:24.310 --> 01:09:26.540
Inflation makes a
gigantic universe.

01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:30.279
And there will be fluctuations
in different observable

01:09:30.279 --> 01:09:31.779
volumes.

01:09:31.779 --> 01:09:35.560
So just like this room has an
average number of molecules

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:37.580
per cubic centimeter,
if you take

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:41.660
any particular cubic centimeter,
it need not be-- in fact,

01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:44.760
it usually won't be--
right at that average.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:47.500
It'll be a little bit above
and a little bit below.

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.100
And when you're two standard
deviations away, it'll be more.

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:50.970
But those are rare.

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:52.090
And blah, blah, blah.

01:09:52.090 --> 01:09:56.030
If we find that the density
is very, very close to 1,

01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:59.200
then this so-called
cosmic variance

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.430
tells us that what we measure
in our own observable volume

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.717
need not be representative
of the whole thing,

01:10:05.717 --> 01:10:07.550
because we're so close
to the dividing line.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:11.600
And most observable volumes will
be close to, but not right on,

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:12.744
the dividing line.

01:10:12.744 --> 01:10:14.160
And so they're not
representative.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:17.180
And so I don't
know any way around

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:19.940
that fundamental
limitation of not

01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:24.140
being able to see outside
our observable universe.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.360
So I don't think we'll
ever know, actually.

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.900
And this actually
has implications

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:29.790
for what the geometry
of the universe is.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:31.645
If the omega is greater
than 1, then it's

01:10:31.645 --> 01:10:32.770
some sort of a hypersphere.

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.290
It's a closed geometry.

01:10:34.290 --> 01:10:36.177
Whereas if omega
total is less than 1,

01:10:36.177 --> 01:10:38.510
then it's either flat space--
well, if it's less than 1,

01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:39.950
then it's hyperbolic geometry.

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:42.290
If it's exactly 1, then
it's Euclidean flat space.

01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:44.020
And I don't know
that we'll ever know

01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:46.570
what the true global
geometry of the universe is.

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:48.940
That doesn't mean we
shouldn't keep doing research

01:10:48.940 --> 01:10:50.620
at Lick Observatory
and elsewhere,

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:51.620
and the public outreach.

01:10:51.620 --> 01:10:54.620
It just means we won't know.

01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:55.910
Yes, Dion.

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:58.010
AUDIENCE: Alex,
how do you estimate

01:10:58.010 --> 01:11:01.805
that the dark energy is
70%, dark matter is 25%,

01:11:01.805 --> 01:11:02.680
and observable is 5%?

01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:02.820
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Yeah.

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:04.070
So how do we get that?

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:07.240
So how do we know that
the dark energy is 70%?

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:10.160
There are many different
constraints, now.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.400
But let me give you the
simplest one, and the one

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:16.160
that we originally used
in a paper back in 1998.

01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:20.150
The current acceleration
of the universe

01:11:20.150 --> 01:11:22.560
tells you who's
winning the tug of war

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:26.210
between pushing outward--
the dark energy--

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:29.760
and pulling inward-- normal
matter and dark matter.

01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.580
It's like a tug of war contest.

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.170
You don't need to know the
absolute amounts of the two

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:35.670
sides.

01:11:35.670 --> 01:11:37.294
You just need to know
their difference.

01:11:37.294 --> 01:11:39.610
Could be that one team
completely gave up

01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:42.860
and the other is pulling
with 1 unit of force.

01:11:42.860 --> 01:11:45.670
Or it could be that this
team is pulling with 1,000

01:11:45.670 --> 01:11:48.110
and the other one is
pulling with 1,001.

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:49.080
The difference is 1.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.840
And that will have
the same effect.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.230
So the redshift
distance relationship

01:11:54.230 --> 01:11:57.870
tells us who's winning the
tug of war and by what amount.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:12:03.690
It tells us the difference
between the push and the pull,

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.200
so to speak.

01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:08.770
So in a sense, omega matter
minus omega dark energy

01:12:08.770 --> 01:12:10.760
is what we get from
the supernovae.

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.420
And that number is negative 0.4.

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.940
Remember that number.

01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:20.000
On the other hand, the
microwave background maps,

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.800
they show you these
little freckles.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.160
And from theory, it's
quite easy to calculate

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:29.000
the spatial scale, the physical
size of a typical freckle.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.810
It turns out there's
a certain size

01:12:30.810 --> 01:12:32.450
having to do with
how far sound could

01:12:32.450 --> 01:12:34.260
have gone in the early
universe by the time

01:12:34.260 --> 01:12:35.240
these things formed.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:36.550
So you know the physical size.

01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:38.130
And that's relatively
independent of what

01:12:38.130 --> 01:12:39.213
the universe is doing now.

01:12:39.213 --> 01:12:40.490
It's quite model-independent.

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:42.459
So you know the physical size.

01:12:42.459 --> 01:12:44.500
You know the angular size
because you measure it.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:48.030
And that then tells you
whether the light rays

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.160
have been going through
a Euclidean space

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.990
or not, because
you're essentially

01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:55.230
measuring whether the sum of the
interior angles of a triangle

01:12:55.230 --> 01:12:58.610
is 180 degrees, greater
than 180 degrees, or less

01:12:58.610 --> 01:13:00.680
than 180 degrees.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.876
We find that it's
equal to 180 degrees.

01:13:02.876 --> 01:13:04.750
That's what the angular
measurements show us.

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:08.176
So it's a Euclidean space
to within the uncertainties.

01:13:08.176 --> 01:13:09.800
It could be either
way I just told you.

01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.990
But it's Euclidean
within the uncertainties.

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:14.020
Well, that, according
to general relativity,

01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:16.410
tells you that the total
omega, the total density

01:13:16.410 --> 01:13:19.250
of the universe, is 1.

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:25.360
If the difference is negative
0.4 and the sum is 1,

01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.430
then matter is point 0.3 and
the dark energy is point 0.7.

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:33.550
AUDIENCE: Is that
0.4 remaining stable?

01:13:33.550 --> 01:13:34.670
ALEX FILIPPENKO: No, no.

01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:38.510
As the universe
expands, the dark energy

01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:40.980
is becoming more and more
of the dominant thing,

01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.740
even if its density
is not changing--

01:13:44.740 --> 01:13:46.820
if it's a property of
space, then its density

01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:49.790
doesn't change-- but
the matter gets diluted.

01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:53.110
If you have 1,000 particles
in a box and the box expands,

01:13:53.110 --> 01:13:55.400
the density of the
particles is decreasing.

01:13:55.400 --> 01:14:00.310
So as a fraction of the pie,
the matter is decreasing.

01:14:00.310 --> 01:14:03.060
And thus as a fraction of
the pie, the dark energy

01:14:03.060 --> 01:14:05.350
is increasing, even
though per unit volume,

01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:08.080
its energy density
appears to be constant.

01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.416
But it's always as a
fraction of the total pie.

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:13.760
So indeed the universe
is now accelerating,

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.650
but not yet exponentiating.

01:14:15.650 --> 01:14:19.610
But as the dark energy
becomes 90%, 95%, 99%,

01:14:19.610 --> 01:14:23.600
99.9% of the total,
then the acceleration

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:28.130
will transition to
an exponentiation.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:31.730
The other thing, without getting
into the microwave background

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:34.210
omega equals 1 total thing,
the other argument-- and this

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:37.254
is one that we also use--
is that, as I told you,

01:14:37.254 --> 01:14:38.670
in the early '90s,
a lot of people

01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:42.470
were convinced that the matter
content of the universe is 0.3.

01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:46.390
So if omega M is 0.3
and omega M minus omega

01:14:46.390 --> 01:14:52.010
dark energy is negative 0.4,
then omega dark energy is 0.7.

01:14:52.010 --> 01:14:55.140
And by the way,
0.3 plus 0.7 is 1

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:57.930
which agrees with the
microwave maps of the flatness

01:14:57.930 --> 01:14:59.880
of the universe.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.420
And now there are
several other ways

01:15:01.420 --> 01:15:02.670
of constraining that, as well.

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.120
So the so-called
concordance cosmology

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:08.110
is now something that
is accepted by most

01:15:08.110 --> 01:15:09.650
astrophysicists that I know.

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:12.099
We're still completely
befuddled by this.

01:15:12.099 --> 01:15:13.640
It's not your
grandmother's universe.

01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.740
It's not what we asked for.

01:15:15.740 --> 01:15:19.150
But it appears to be that
that's what our universe is.

01:15:19.150 --> 01:15:22.320
Or-- and Noelle will confirm
that sometimes I wake up

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.170
screaming at night at 3:00
in the morning-- I sometimes

01:15:26.170 --> 01:15:28.630
think that dark
matter and dark energy

01:15:28.630 --> 01:15:33.470
are our 20th and 21st
century counterparts

01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:35.690
to Ptolemaic epicycles.

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:36.190
Right?

01:15:36.190 --> 01:15:39.590
Epicycles could
be used to explain

01:15:39.590 --> 01:15:44.140
the observed positions of
planets to arbitrary accuracy.

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:47.490
You could add epicycles
on top of epicycles.

01:15:47.490 --> 01:15:51.980
By the way, this is a
Fourier series, right?

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:54.140
Any periodic function
can be represented

01:15:54.140 --> 01:15:57.220
by a sum of sines of
different amplitudes, phases,

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.206
and periods.

01:15:58.206 --> 01:16:00.580
Well, that's what a bunch of
circles on top of each other

01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.079
are.

01:16:01.079 --> 01:16:03.810
So Ptolemy invented
Fourier analysis

01:16:03.810 --> 01:16:07.560
with the first two terms
long before Fourier did,

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.740
and he didn't know it.

01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.900
But that's what it is.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.370
It is arbitrarily accurate,
if that's all you want,

01:16:13.370 --> 01:16:17.340
is accuracy in terms of
predicted positions of planets

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.800
versus observed
positions of planets.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:23.380
But ultimately, now-- no fault
of Ptolemy's-- we know that

01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.600
it's wrong.

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:28.090
He was brilliant for having
conceived of the idea.

01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:29.660
And it lasted 1,500 years.

01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:32.510
And he made his living
being an astrologer.

01:16:32.510 --> 01:16:35.590
And so he needed to know the
positions of Mars and stuff.

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:37.020
And it worked well.

01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:39.380
But it ended up being wrong.

01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:41.510
So dark matter and
dark energy are simply

01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:46.280
our best current descriptions
to try to explain what we see.

01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.200
But they may well be wrong.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.540
And what I'm hoping is that
one of the youngsters excited

01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:54.040
by Google Making Science
and Lick Observatory

01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:01.010
will figure out what it
is if it is indeed wrong.

01:17:01.010 --> 01:17:02.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you, Alex.

01:17:02.120 --> 01:17:02.950
We really appreciate it.

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:03.250
ALEX FILIPPENKO: Thank you.

01:17:03.250 --> 01:17:04.150
Thank you.
