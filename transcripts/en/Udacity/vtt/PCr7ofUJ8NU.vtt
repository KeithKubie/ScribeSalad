These numbers are actually really important. They can represent a fraction. They

00:00:04.778 --> 00:00:09.362
can represent a parts of a whole. So, for example, for the circle I have 3 parts

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:13.460
out of 8 or 3 8ths. The three represents my numerator, it's how many parts I

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:17.828
have. The eight represents my denominator, it's how many pieces or parts are in

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.068
the whole figure. Fractions don't always have to refer to shapes, they can refer

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.999
to other things, and we'll look at this later in the course. But for now, we're

00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:29.934
just going to focus on these images and shapes. So 3 8ths is a fraction for this

00:00:29.946 --> 00:00:33.707
circle, I want to you find the fraction for these others. You can enter your

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.800
answer in these boxes. 3 8ths can also be written as 3 slash 8. It's another way

00:00:37.812 --> 00:00:41.573
of writing a fraction. That's how you should type it in when you type it into

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:42.163
these boxes.
