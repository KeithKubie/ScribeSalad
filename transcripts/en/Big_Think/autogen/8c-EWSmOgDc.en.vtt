we have taken cells from the carcass of
 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.470
we have taken cells from the carcass of
an animal that died decades ago and

an animal that died decades ago and
 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.799
an animal that died decades ago and
brought them back to life and so it is

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809
brought them back to life and so it is
 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.350
brought them back to life and so it is

much it would cost to reassemble the
 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.959
much it would cost to reassemble the
genome of the Neanderthal man and then

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969
genome of the Neanderthal man and then
 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840

of course if a young Neanderthal boy is

of course if a young Neanderthal boy is
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.090
of course if a young Neanderthal boy is
born then the question is where do you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100
born then the question is where do you
 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.020

is a question that we're going to be
 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.680
is a question that we're going to be
facing in the coming decades because it

can actually turn that gene on and

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590
can actually turn that gene on and
 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.190

have sequenced the genes and yes it is a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120
have sequenced the genes and yes it is a
 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.440

because a long time ago chickens had

because a long time ago chickens had
 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.039
because a long time ago chickens had
webbed feet and also teeth you can

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049
webbed feet and also teeth you can
 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.720
webbed feet and also teeth you can
actually bring back teeth inside

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730
actually bring back teeth inside
 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.110
actually bring back teeth inside
chickens so then the question is is it

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
chickens so then the question is is it
