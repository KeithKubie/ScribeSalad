00:00:00.828 --> 00:00:03.969
In lesson 9, we learn that a mutation of the BRCA1

00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:08.189
or 2 gene can significantly increase your risk for breast cancer.

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.270
&gt;&gt; Until recently, a company called Myriad Genetics held patents

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:14.040
for three of the most prevalent mutations in the BRCA1

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.760
and 2 genes. Allowing them to dominate the gene diagnostic

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.870
test market. Actually, charging thousands of dollars for an individual test.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.140
&gt;&gt; However, in June of 2013, the

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.100
United States Supreme Court ruled against them.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.200
Saying that you can't patent a naturally occurring DNA sequence. Now this will

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.100
open up the market for many other companies to start doing this test.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.470
&gt;&gt; Now the Supreme Court decision was unanimous.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.870
Although they still allow you to patent synthetic

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.080
DNA sequence. But what we want to know from

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.840
you is, do you agree with this decision?

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.940
Do you think that companies like Myriad Genetics

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.610
should be able to patent naturally occurring genes

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.420
found in individual humans? Check yes or no, and then tell us why in the box.
