00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.960
Hey it's me, Destin. Welcom back to Smarter Every Day

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.780
Every December, here at Smarter Every Day, we help an orphanage in Peru,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.060
and a million people are new to Smarter Every Day this year, so you might not know about this.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.360
So if you want to learn how we got to this point, click on any of these videos:

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.480
However, because I didn't get to go this year, I've got the guy in charge of the orphanage here.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.760
His name is Tyler. He's going to update us, you ready? *Claps*

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.560
Tyler: Sup.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.820
*Laughter*

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.860
Tyler is wearing the mask

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.060
What are you going to tell us about today?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.900
Tyler: Just want to get you updated on what's been going on over the past year.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.440
The ultimate goal of this video is to convince people to support on Patreon, right?

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.020
Please.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.180
Supporting on Patreon is going to get us more towards the operation of the orphanage.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.260
Hopefully at the end of the video, if you're convinced that we're doing a good thing, maybe you can support on Patreon.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.660
Tyler: The coolest thing about this year was just walking out, up to the property for the first time

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.200
and meeting just eight new kids, who now are off the streets who are in a safe and loving home.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.880
Destin: We had 14 kids last year, and these are eight new kids

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.700
Tyler: Right. 
Destin: What's the deal with the playground equipment?

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.900
Tyler: So, super cool, one of the local churches that helps support our home,

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.200
donated all of the playground equipment for us.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.060
Destin: Really? That's a really legit playground man.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.080
Yeah, it's for real. The kids are loving it.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.680
We've had this wall that goes to the front of our property and the front gate for a long time

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.200
and it's just been bare, looks like concrete, and was starting to get mold all over it,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.740
so we wanted to make it look nice because the first thing these kids are going to see when they come to this home is this gate, and this wall.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.440
We want them to see that the home that they're coming to is a place that is well cared for

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.560
because that also tells them that they are going to be well cared for.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.280
So we have lot's of things growing in the garden:

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.620
We've got Cocona. You see that fruit they're picking, that's called Cocona.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.540
We've got Pineapples, Bananas, Mangos, Papayas,

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.000
tons of stuff that they're eating every day.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.220
Destin: OK there's the kids all--That was my favorite part: sitting down with them.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.460
Oh, a new house!

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.100
Tyler: Yeah, so, coolest thing: opened up our third home this year, so

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.300
We finished construction in June,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.620
and by August, we were pretty much full of kids.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.700
I'm getting toured around this house by these kids, and all of the sudden,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.600
Edmund opens up the freezer, and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.200
I look in, and looking at what's in there, is this alligator tail.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.080
Destin: Like in the Freezer?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.140
Tyler: In the freezer! Just a whole alligator tail.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.700
Like scales and everything.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.040
Just like complete alligator tail and I'm like:

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.200
"What in the heck is this?!"

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.200
You're just like: no big deal?

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.200
No big deal, they're like: "Yeah,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.660
don't you have one in your freezer?"

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:12.460
*laugh*

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.060
Destin: This is the third house, and so you have a total of eight kids in each house?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.480
Tyler: Yeah, so actually we have a total of 23 kids now total, so we have eight kids in two houses,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.780
and then seven kids in one of the other houses.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.260
Destin: So one of the main things I like about Not Forgotten is that it's not like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.060
you have a big orphanage house, and the kids just have a bunk bed kind of thing:

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.400
They really feel like it's their house.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.460
Stability in a completely different way in the orphanage model.

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.820
So, what's going on here with these guys?

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.720
Tyler: So here, there showing us, you know, your room,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.140
you know, they'll say: "This is my place, this is my stuff."

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.760
and that's just really cool to see these kids who haven't had anything before--

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.700
Destin: --I like the swagger of the little guy.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.700
Like he's walking you around in his house--

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.620
Tyler: --NehemÃ­as is a stud

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.580
*laughter*

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.980
Tyler: I mean, he will tell you what's up.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.040
Destin: And the toilets look good, good stuff.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.380
Tyler: Yeah it's important for these kids to learn to take care of the things they have,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.940
and all the kids know what they're supposed to do, it's on a rotating basis,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.540
and they are learning what it's like to take care of your stuff.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.840
Destin: Oh look, is this la playa? They're on the beach?

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.940
Tyler: Yeah, there's a big lake there, so they're on the beach, swimming.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.720
Destin: OK, so these are all the kids right now?
Tyler: Yeah.

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.000
Destin: So there are three families right now in charge of these children.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.460
Tyler: Yeah, they live with a Peruvian mother and father who loves and takes care of them as if they were their own.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:17.580
Destin: That's pretty awesome.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.120
OK, that's it. That is the update from the Not Forgotten Orphanage in Equitos, Peru.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.500
This is a really big deal.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.660
I want to high-five you

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.400
I remember talking about this in a Chilies, was it?

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.960
Tyler: Yeah, we talked, and at Johnny's BBQ I think.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.000
Yeah, this is a really big deal.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.220
It went from, like, a crazy conversation to actually happening,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.820
and I am really excited about that,

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.920
so if you want to support Not forgotten,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.680
please consider going to Patreon.com/NotForgotten

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.880
Then are we going to do the patches thing?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.640
Yeah, we're doing patches.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.640
OK, so if you go to that website, if you support at a certain level per month,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.820
then we're going to send you a Not Forgotten patch for this year.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.840
Which is a really cool thing--I think it's a cool idea.
Tyler: Yeah.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140
Also, if you want to vote for this video

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.280
on the Project for Awesome we would really appreciate that.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.900
Project for Awesome has been really big as well
Tyler: Huge.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.840
We've gotten so much support through Project for Awesome, as well as so much awareness

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.880
So there you go, go to the links in the video description,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.400
we've got two of them: number 1, go vote for this video on the Project for Awesome

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.540
and number two, go to Patreon.com/NotForgotten

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.320
That's it, I'm Destin, getting Smarter Every Day,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.800
Tyler: Tyler, see ya later!

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.880
Have a good one, bye!

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.180
Destin: Do you wan't to explain what that means?

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.780
Yeah, sure, so the outer circle with the arrow depicts a cycle,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.460
and what we're doing at Not Forgotten is we are breaking that cycle

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.020
and the colors depict the Peru flag:

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.860
red and white.

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:30.800
Destin: Nice!
Very cool.
