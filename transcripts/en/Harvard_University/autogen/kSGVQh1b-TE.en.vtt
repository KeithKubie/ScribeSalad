how we think of needing to engage often
unlikely but necessary partners in

unlikely but necessary partners in
 

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.820
unlikely but necessary partners in
tackling any public health challenge or

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:28.830
tackling any public health challenge or
 

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.260
tackling any public health challenge or
other challenge where we believe we are

00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:30.270
other challenge where we believe we are
 

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.150

uniquely positioned to make a difference

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160
uniquely positioned to make a difference
 

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.600
uniquely positioned to make a difference
and also how we think about saying no

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:34.610
and also how we think about saying no
 

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.160
and also how we think about saying no
because for those of us that care so

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:37.170
because for those of us that care so

much about public health I think so

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:41.370
much about public health I think so

much about public health I think so
often we think we have to say yes but

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:43.860
often we think we have to say yes but
 

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.260
often we think we have to say yes but
sometimes the smartest thing we can do

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:45.270
sometimes the smartest thing we can do
 

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:48.470
sometimes the smartest thing we can do
is to say no to the first option so that

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480
is to say no to the first option so that
 

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.660
is to say no to the first option so that
we better can say yes to the second

00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:50.670
we better can say yes to the second
 

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:51.800
we better can say yes to the second
option where we're more well-positioned

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:51.810
option where we're more well-positioned
 

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:53.660
option where we're more well-positioned
and equipped to make a difference so

you at all I think there were lots of

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:30.030
you at all I think there were lots of
 

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.220
you at all I think there were lots of
questions there and I'll try to answer

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:31.230
questions there and I'll try to answer
 

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.840
questions there and I'll try to answer
them in in a way that that makes sense

them in in a way that that makes sense
 

00:17:35.850 --> 00:17:38.840
them in in a way that that makes sense
in an overall arc and I'll do that in a

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:38.850
in an overall arc and I'll do that in a
 

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:42.800
in an overall arc and I'll do that in a
in a couple of ways I think that the

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:42.810
in a couple of ways I think that the
 

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.540
in a couple of ways I think that the
fact that the foundation has been

00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:44.550
fact that the foundation has been
 

00:17:44.550 --> 00:17:45.919
fact that the foundation has been
successful in some of the ways that I

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:45.929
successful in some of the ways that I
 

00:17:45.929 --> 00:17:48.560

outlined actually increases the burden

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.570
outlined actually increases the burden
 

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:52.040
outlined actually increases the burden
on us to kind of continue to prove the

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:52.050
on us to kind of continue to prove the
 

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.600
on us to kind of continue to prove the
validity of our model but also to

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:53.610
validity of our model but also to
 

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.580
validity of our model but also to
syndicate the validity of our model you

know I think that it is now terrific

00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840
know I think that it is now terrific
 

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.810
know I think that it is now terrific
that we take for granted that there are

00:17:59.810 --> 00:17:59.820
that we take for granted that there are
 

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.580
that we take for granted that there are
lots of market discontinuities that

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.590
lots of market discontinuities that
 

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:04.280
lots of market discontinuities that
remain low-hanging fruit in various

00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:04.290
remain low-hanging fruit in various
 

00:18:04.290 --> 00:18:05.390
remain low-hanging fruit in various
health commodities around the world

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400
health commodities around the world
 

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.590
health commodities around the world
there's lots of work that's happening

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:06.600
there's lots of work that's happening
 

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.740
there's lots of work that's happening
for example now on various testing

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:09.750
for example now on various testing
 

00:18:09.750 --> 00:18:11.780
for example now on various testing
economics you're trying to change not

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:11.790
economics you're trying to change not
 

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.960
economics you're trying to change not
only kind of HIV or rapid infant

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:14.970
only kind of HIV or rapid infant
 

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:16.790
only kind of HIV or rapid infant
diagnostic testing economics but

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:16.800
diagnostic testing economics but
 

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.100
diagnostic testing economics but
increasingly to change the economics

00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:19.110
increasingly to change the economics
 

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:21.950

around malaria and tuberculosis testing

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:21.960
around malaria and tuberculosis testing
 

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.930
around malaria and tuberculosis testing
and otherwise you know we are engaged in

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:23.940
and otherwise you know we are engaged in
 

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:25.250
and otherwise you know we are engaged in
some of that work but most of that work

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:25.260
some of that work but most of that work
 

00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.840
some of that work but most of that work
we are not engaged in and I think that

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:26.850
we are not engaged in and I think that
 

00:18:26.850 --> 00:18:29.389
we are not engaged in and I think that
that is is terrific

00:18:29.389 --> 00:18:29.399
that is is terrific
 

00:18:29.399 --> 00:18:30.980
that is is terrific
and so part of what I've done at the

00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:30.990
and so part of what I've done at the
 

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:32.889
and so part of what I've done at the
foundation is to try to help us be more

00:18:32.889 --> 00:18:32.899
foundation is to try to help us be more
 

00:18:32.899 --> 00:18:35.419
foundation is to try to help us be more
open-source to try to be more

00:18:35.419 --> 00:18:35.429
open-source to try to be more
 

00:18:35.429 --> 00:18:37.369
open-source to try to be more
transparent with our partners whether

generation or otherwise with kind of

generation or otherwise with kind of
 

00:18:46.679 --> 00:18:48.409
generation or otherwise with kind of
what we've done that we really think has

00:18:48.409 --> 00:18:48.419
what we've done that we really think has
 

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:50.570
what we've done that we really think has
worked kind of at a very granular and

00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:50.580
worked kind of at a very granular and
 

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:52.999
worked kind of at a very granular and
practical level so that others can learn

00:18:52.999 --> 00:18:53.009
practical level so that others can learn
 

00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:55.850
practical level so that others can learn
more quickly from our successes and also

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:55.860
more quickly from our successes and also
 

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:59.269
more quickly from our successes and also
our stumbles and then I think we have an

00:18:59.269 --> 00:18:59.279
our stumbles and then I think we have an
 

00:18:59.279 --> 00:19:03.799
our stumbles and then I think we have an
obligation to think about logical

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:03.809
obligation to think about logical
 

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:05.749
obligation to think about logical
extensions of our work that may not be

00:19:05.749 --> 00:19:05.759
extensions of our work that may not be
 

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.759
extensions of our work that may not be
immediately apparent so again thinking

00:19:07.759 --> 00:19:07.769
immediately apparent so again thinking
 

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:09.159
immediately apparent so again thinking
about the Alliance

00:19:09.159 --> 00:19:09.169
about the Alliance
 

00:19:09.169 --> 00:19:11.509
about the Alliance
I'm deeply passionate and I talked about

00:19:11.509 --> 00:19:11.519
I'm deeply passionate and I talked about
 

00:19:11.519 --> 00:19:14.470

that's actually been really useful for

that's actually been really useful for
 

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:21.250
that's actually been really useful for
me because it enables me to absorb

that I I took at mailman your PhD and

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:55.580
that I I took at mailman your PhD and
 

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:57.520
that I I took at mailman your PhD and
now your course at mailman that you're

00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:57.530
now your course at mailman that you're
 

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:59.440
now your course at mailman that you're
teaching on global health is about

00:25:59.440 --> 00:25:59.450
teaching on global health is about
 

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:01.990
teaching on global health is about
global health and governance so what I'm

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000
global health and governance so what I'm
 

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.820
global health and governance so what I'm
wondering is what do you think is the

00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:03.830
wondering is what do you think is the
 

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.380
wondering is what do you think is the
key thing people don't understand about

00:26:05.380 --> 00:26:05.390
key thing people don't understand about
 

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:06.970
key thing people don't understand about
the link between goal health and

00:26:06.970 --> 00:26:06.980
the link between goal health and
 

00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:10.630
the link between goal health and
governance and especially what what does

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:10.640
governance and especially what what does
 

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.910
governance and especially what what does
it mean that governance connects to

00:26:12.910 --> 00:26:12.920
it mean that governance connects to
 

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.770
it mean that governance connects to
global health and global health outcomes

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:14.780
global health and global health outcomes
 

00:26:14.780 --> 00:26:17.740
global health and global health outcomes
to you goodness well again I think lots

00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:17.750
to you goodness well again I think lots
 

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.260
to you goodness well again I think lots
of questions I think you know one of the

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.270
of questions I think you know one of the
 

00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:23.830
of questions I think you know one of the
challenges is that so often we focus

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:23.840
challenges is that so often we focus
 

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.330
challenges is that so often we focus
only on what's in front of us I think

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:25.340
only on what's in front of us I think
 

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:26.950
only on what's in front of us I think
that's inevitable kind of for all of us

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960
that's inevitable kind of for all of us
 

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.680
that's inevitable kind of for all of us
and so you know understanding kind of

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:29.690
and so you know understanding kind of
 

00:26:29.690 --> 00:26:32.230
and so you know understanding kind of
the ways in which the world works sort

00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240
the ways in which the world works sort
 

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.480
the ways in which the world works sort
of that I would argue what has happened

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:34.490
of that I would argue what has happened
 

00:26:34.490 --> 00:26:36.220
of that I would argue what has happened
over the last year with Ebola was not

00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:36.230
over the last year with Ebola was not
 

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:39.670
over the last year with Ebola was not
inevitable kind of in a kind of

the benefit of having three family
members is that you have

00:40:16.089 --> 00:40:16.099

kind of two candidates in a moderator
 

00:40:18.019 --> 00:40:20.499
kind of two candidates in a moderator
like built-in to the breakfast table or

like built-in to the breakfast table or
 

00:40:20.509 --> 00:40:22.630
like built-in to the breakfast table or
the dinner table and so we would have

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640
the dinner table and so we would have
 

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:27.009
the dinner table and so we would have
these kind of fierce debates in which my

00:40:27.009 --> 00:40:27.019
these kind of fierce debates in which my
 

00:40:27.019 --> 00:40:30.579

00:40:35.559 --> 00:40:35.569
to play my father to play Frank white
 

00:40:35.569 --> 00:40:38.199
to play my father to play Frank white
and to play the moderator and I think

00:40:38.199 --> 00:40:38.209
and to play the moderator and I think
 

00:40:38.209 --> 00:40:40.949
and to play the moderator and I think
that was hugely useful training not only

00:40:40.949 --> 00:40:40.959
that was hugely useful training not only
 

00:40:40.959 --> 00:40:44.979
that was hugely useful training not only
for my debating skills later in life but

00:40:44.979 --> 00:40:44.989
for my debating skills later in life but
 

00:40:44.989 --> 00:40:49.029
for my debating skills later in life but
also for being comfortable talking to my

parents on an equal level and that they
 

00:40:51.529 --> 00:40:55.420

00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:57.160
always treated me with the expectation
of having my own opinion and I think

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:57.170
of having my own opinion and I think
 

00:40:57.170 --> 00:40:58.930
of having my own opinion and I think
