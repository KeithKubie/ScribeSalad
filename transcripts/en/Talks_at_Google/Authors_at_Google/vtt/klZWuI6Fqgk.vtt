BORIS: Today with
us is Roberto Trotta

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.590
with his book, "The
Edge of the Sky."

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.970
It's going to be an interesting
cosmology talk for those of you

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.890
who would like to learn
more about cosmology

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:17.740
but in simple words.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.020
So let me just give you
a brief introduction.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.520
Roberto Trotta is a
theoretical cosmologist

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.550
in the astrophysics group of
the Imperial College in London.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.720
He has held research positions
at the University of Geneva

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.480
and the University of Oxford,
as well as visiting positions

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.637
at the African Institute for
Mathematical Sciences in Cape

00:00:36.637 --> 00:00:42.240
Town, the Institut Astrophysique
de Paris, and the University

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.750
of California at Santa Barbara.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.230
One of the world's leading
figures in astrostatistics,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.140
and new discipline focusing on
the use of statistical methods

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.470
to solve problems in
cosmology and astrophysics,

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.960
he has published more
than 50 scientific papers,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.950
contributed to two books,
and received numerous awards

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.970
for his research, including the
Michelson Prize of Case Western

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.650
Reserve University, the Lord
Kelvin Award of the British

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.500
Association for the
Advancement of Science,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.620
and a public engagement
fellowship by the Science

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.650
and Technology Facilities
Council in the UK.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.940
Please join me in welcoming
Roberto to Google.

00:01:24.635 --> 00:01:26.010
ROBERTO TROTTA:
Thank you, Boris.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.280
And good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.830
And thanks for being here today.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.510
I'm very pleased
to be here today

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.590
in such an amazing place
full of computer people who

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.350
can search the entire worldwide
computer to answer all

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.320
of your questions and can draw
a picture of the streets in

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.820
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.370
And now, so I hear,
you're even building

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.440
cars that can drive alone.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.190
So this is really the
perfect place for me

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.400
to talk about my new book,
"The Edge of the Sky."

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.074
This book came out of a
straightforward simple idea,

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:58.490
that it should be
possible to talk

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.650
about very hard things
in a straightforward way

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.210
that all people can understand.

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:06.480
The problem with student
people like myself, you see,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.060
is that sometimes we get
carried away and speak

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.660
about our work using
words in a tone

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.590
that only other student
people can understand.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.730
This makes it not
possible to have

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.970
a conversation with other
people, people like you.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.250
After a little
while, your eyes will

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.300
begin to stare into empty
space, and you'll probably

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.129
walk away as soon as you
can with a silent sigh,

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.045
happy to have escaped.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.220
A way to avoid all that is by
talking with only the most used

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.910
ten hundred words
in this tongue.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.350
When I heard about
this, I thought

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.884
it could be fun to use it
to explain the [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:41.884 --> 00:02:43.300
And this is what
my book is about,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.082
and what this here is about.

00:02:46.082 --> 00:02:47.540
I would like to
share with you some

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.340
of the ideas behind the
book and the story of how

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.710
this slightly crazy
idea became reality.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.870
So you might have thought that
this was a little strange,

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.370
perhaps.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.840
And you might have thought,
well this is down to the fact

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.820
that I spent way too
much time in Britain.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:07.090
And so of course we know that
the United States and Britain

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.330
are two nations which are
separated by the same language.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.880
But actually, that's
not the reason

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.550
why this sounded a
little bit weird.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.030
The reason why
this was different

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.980
is because it was written
using only the most common ten

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.780
hundred words in
English, which is

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.077
the idea behind "The
Edge of the Sky."

00:03:22.077 --> 00:03:23.910
As so I just wanted to
give you a little bit

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.940
of a sense for what
this language is about,

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.810
and how it actually
can change the way

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.960
we communicate with each other.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.110
So before I go on,
I'd like to ask

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.485
you to keep your phones on in
case you have switched them

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:37.609
off-- I hope not-- and
please join the conversation

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.690
on Twitter by getting in touch
with me with my Twitter handle

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.940
and #theedgeofthesky hashtag.

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.430
So let me take a
step back and go back

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.520
to the '60s, at a time
when very little was known

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.000
about the universe
and we didn't have

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.600
all of the great data and
the great capabilities

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.450
to observe the sky and the
universe as we do today.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.400
These two gentlemen came up
with a wonderful discovery

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.090
in 1965, Penzias and Wilson.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.330
They were working at
Bell Labs in New Jersey,

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.260
not far away from
Princeton in fact.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.840
And they had a big
microwave antenna

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.040
with which they were looking
into doing some experiments

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.030
in microwave
communication, early days

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.571
still before satellite
communication.

00:04:23.571 --> 00:04:26.930
They were trying to bounce off
the microwaves of some passing

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.240
satellites, trying to
communicate long distance using

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.740
microwaves.

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.870
But the problem was that they
couldn't make their antenna

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.037
work because they kept picking
up a very strange background

00:04:39.037 --> 00:04:41.620
noise, a noise that they didn't
know where it was coming from.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.970
And they tried very, very
hard to get rid of the noise

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:45.360
and they couldn't.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.890
At some point then they got in
touch with a team of scientists

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.820
at Princeton who were actually
trying to build an antenna

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.810
to look for this kind of noise.

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.800
And this microwave noise,
this microwave light

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.230
was none other than the light
echo from the Big Bang itself.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.524
Unbeknownst to them, they'd
discover the [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:06.690
radiation from the Big Bang.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.910
And so in 1965 they
came out with this paper

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.900
here, a paper that in
only one and a half pages

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:15.080
talks about this
momentous discovery.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.390
And the title of the
paper is "The Measurement

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.022
of Excess Antenna
Temperature at 4080 Mc/s".

00:05:22.022 --> 00:05:24.990
And that's not a great
title, to be fair.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.644
What they were trying to say
is, we have found evidence

00:05:28.644 --> 00:05:30.060
that the universe
had a beginning.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.170
We've discover the luminous
echo from the Big Bang.

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:35.530
But this title is kind
of jargony and not really

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.902
accessible to anybody,
even them to be fair.

00:05:38.902 --> 00:05:40.860
They didn't actually know
what they discovered.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.787
It was the Princeton
team that told them

00:05:42.787 --> 00:05:44.670
what the discovery mean

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.130
And sometimes in
communicating the science,

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:49.070
scientific papers are
perhaps not the best way

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.050
of getting the message across.

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.140
So you might think 1965
was early days still

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:56.460
in science and astrophysics.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.960
And certainly,
science communication

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.390
wasn't as developed
as it is today.

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.695
And so things must have
improved in the meantime.

00:06:02.695 --> 00:06:05.550
So let's have a look at another
momentous discovery in my field

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:07.690
in astrophysics,
a discovery that

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:11.110
was worthy of a Nobel
Prize for physics in 2011.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:15.220
And here is a paper in 1999,
published in the "Astrophysical

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:18.770
Journal" with a title that
goes as follows, "Measurements

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.420
of Omega and Lambda from 42
High-Redshift Supernovae".

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:25.450
Now, wherever you see Greek
letters in scientific papers,

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.630
and specifically
astrophysical papers,

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:29.390
that's a sign that
we the scientists are

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.765
trying to be clever and smart,
and trying to make it look

00:06:31.765 --> 00:06:34.098
like as if we know a lot about
what we're talking about,

00:06:34.098 --> 00:06:35.420
but we don't necessarily.

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:36.920
And so the paper
goes on [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.737
"we report measurement of
the mass density [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:39.737 --> 00:06:41.820
and cosmological constant
density omega and lambda

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.010
of the universe,
based on the analysis

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.480
of 42 type 1a supernovae
discovered by the supernova

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.609
[INAUDIBLE] project,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:06:48.609 --> 00:06:49.900
And it goes on, and on, and on.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.500
And so what they're trying
to say with this paper is,

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.400
we've discovered evidence
that the universe

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.410
is expanding in
an accelerated way

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.690
and is being ripped
apart by an unknown force

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.620
that we call dark energy.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.180
And none of that
really comes through

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.632
if you read the paper, or the
abstract, or indeed the title.

00:07:05.632 --> 00:07:06.340
So that was 1999.

00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:08.840
You might think, well
actually nowadays,

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.400
21st century with
all the social media

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.000
and so on, communicating
exciting science

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.260
must have become so much easier.

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.400
So let's have a look
at another discovery,

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.780
another Nobel Prize for physics,
this time at the large hadron

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.590
colider, the particle
accelerator at CERN in Geneva.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.680
And here the title
is, "Observation

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.350
of a new Boson on a Mass of
125 GeV with the CMS Experiment

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:32.840
at the LHC".

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.490
Now you can see now that there's
no longer a list of authors.

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:39.770
There's only a CMS collaboration
tag as a list of authors.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.550
That's because
science has become

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.460
so big in the
meantime, two people

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:45.880
from Nobel Prize
for physics in 1965

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.870
the discoverers of the
microwave background,

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.260
about 25 or 30 people
on the previous paper

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:53.160
for the supernova type
1a dark energy discovery.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.670
And now the CMS collaboration,
about 5,000 scientists

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:58.180
working on these big projects.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.985
So that's how big
science is nowadays.

00:08:01.277 --> 00:08:02.860
And how do they
present these results?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.160
Well, they say results are
presented-- no we go over

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.750
to passive form to make it
look a bit more impersonal

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:10.482
and objective.

00:08:10.482 --> 00:08:12.940
"Results are presented from
searches for the standard model

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.570
Higgs boson proton-proton
collisions at square root of s

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:19.300
equals 7 and 8 TeV in the
Compact Muon Solenoid".

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.240
A compact muon solenoid
is-- [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.310
is like a five
story high building

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:29.960
full of instrumented iron and
other computerized detectors.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.407
That's what "compact"
means nowadays in physics.

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:34.240
And so the compact muon
solenoid [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.909
MHC using data
samples corresponding

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:38.750
to [INAUDIBLE] of up to
5.1 inverse [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.520
at 7 [INAUDIBLE] and 5.3 inverse
[INAUDIBLE] at 8 [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.929
et cetera, et cetera.

00:08:43.929 --> 00:08:45.467
And so what are
they trying to say?

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:47.050
They're trying to
tell us that they've

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.660
discovered the God
particle, the Higgs boson,

00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.560
the particle that gives
mass to all other particles.

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.060
And so you can see that
scientific research papers are

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:59.470
not perhaps the very best places
to look for the excitement

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.020
that all of this
great science actually

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.990
is about and the
great discoveries

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:06.670
that this science is supposed to
be communicating to the public

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:07.530
as well.

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.930
And fair enough, those
are scientific papers

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:11.930
which are written for
specialists by specialists

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.940
and are targeting a very
restricted audience.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.220
But as a scientist
working in this field,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.880
my quest has been
for many years now

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.020
to find ways of talking about
these very exciting science

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.890
topics in more accessible,
direct, and exciting ways

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.980
to communicate with the
public and the educated public

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:31.990
and people who are interested
in these discoveries in a more

00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.770
effective way.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:35.715
And try to find ways of not
only talking about the science

00:09:35.715 --> 00:09:39.310
that those great discoveries
are about, but also

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.430
about having a
dialogue with people,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.400
breaking down the
communication barriers,

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:47.350
the jargon such as those
examples that we just saw

00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:52.090
is raising in our
discussion between ourselves

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:54.760
and the public, the
scientists and the public.

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.410
So my work in
astrophysics and cosmology

00:09:57.410 --> 00:10:01.565
is about using big data
and astrostatistical--

00:10:01.565 --> 00:10:03.589
that is to say advanced
statistical methods--

00:10:03.589 --> 00:10:05.880
to analyze those big data
and trying to understand them

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.420
in terms of what they mean
for the fundamental nature

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:10.410
and fundamental theories
of our universe.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.350
So big questions, such as what
is the nature of dark energy,

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.850
dark matter, stuff that we don't
know in the universe that's

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.270
dark and invisible, and
yet is responsible for 95%

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.250
of the universe?

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.720
What does the
universe come from?

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.090
What will be its final fate?

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.130
So all of those
questions are usually

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.000
exciting to us the scientists,
but also the public at large.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.940
How do we talk about
those discoveries

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:36.110
in a way that's more meaningful
and more interactive, and not

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.877
full of jargon?

00:10:37.877 --> 00:10:39.460
So for a decade now,
I've been looking

00:10:39.460 --> 00:10:41.750
for different ways
of communicating

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.410
this exciting science
with the public.

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:45.190
And I've tried different things.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.640
I've tried using food
to talk about cosmology.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.840
So explaining the
Hubble expansion,

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:54.640
the expansion of the
universe in terms of pizza

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.570
dough, for example.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.880
Here you see an
example of our galaxy,

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.100
the Milky Way, here, and a model
of the universe expanding here

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:04.750
with other galaxies-- the other
bits of olives expanding out

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:05.660
as time goes on.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.380
In this sense, you can
see the universe expands

00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:10.725
and all galaxies move away
from every other galaxy.

00:11:10.725 --> 00:11:14.550
That's a perfect 2-D model
of the universe which

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.925
you can make in
your own kitchen.

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:16.966
And it works fairly well.

00:11:16.966 --> 00:11:18.745
You can see this
little yardstick, which

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:21.030
is made of a piece
of bean, I think.

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:22.835
And you can see
that distances grow.

00:11:22.835 --> 00:11:27.123
And between galaxies here,
it's one bean unit, one

00:11:27.123 --> 00:11:28.860
and a half, two bean units.

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:30.260
It works.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:32.810
So that's a funny
way of engaging

00:11:32.810 --> 00:11:34.510
with the public,
because it's hands on.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:36.468
It's stuff that you can
do in your own kitchen.

00:11:36.468 --> 00:11:38.120
And I've taken it
to the next stage,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:41.640
and I've tried putting
on a cosmic cookery show.

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.410
And I'm cooking pancakes
with a live audience,

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:49.350
and because this is in the
UK where health and safety

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:53.590
laws are very strict, you can
see I even have a little fire

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.110
extinguisher at hand just
in case things go wrong,

00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:59.020
as they do when you
experiment with a microwave

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:00.660
and then burn chocolate
in a microwave.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:02.035
There's lots of
smoke coming out.

00:12:02.035 --> 00:12:03.930
It's very spectacular,
and it's fun.

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.330
It's a way of engaging
the public, as well,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:08.650
in a way that's a
little bit different.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:10.790
I work with artists
and designers

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:16.000
to build the artwork that is
inspired by cosmological ideas.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.980
Here is, for
example, a structure,

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.470
a creation that
conceptualizes redshift

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.400
in a slightly different way.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.150
And I've worked with
architects and others

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:28.740
to create things like
this pinball machine that

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:31.570
was exhibited at the
[INAUDIBLE] a few years ago

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.380
that represented some sort
of potential energy idea.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:36.879
It would be a long
story, probably

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:37.920
a story for another talk.

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:40.045
But the point is that I've
tried different avenues.

00:12:40.045 --> 00:12:42.020
But I was looking
always for something

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.390
that was a little different.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.750
I was looking for something that
was more immediate and creative

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.660
in a way that would
involve language as well.

00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:52.960
And perhaps all along I
had in the back of my mind

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.830
this great example that goes
back to Ernest Hemingway

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:57.540
apparently.

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.165
I don't know whether
the story is true,

00:12:59.165 --> 00:13:00.600
but it's attributed to him.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.990
And the story is that
Hemingway was one day sitting

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:04.510
around the table
with some friends.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:09.160
And those friends challenged
him to construct a novel

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.720
in a very short number
of words, just six works.

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.670
And he said, yes of
course, I can do it.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.410
And a bet was made, and
he accepted the bet.

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:21.000
And then he sat there for a few
minutes and thought about it.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.170
And he came up with
what has become

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:29.230
known as a form
of flash fiction.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.900
And the novel that he wrote
in only six words is this.

00:13:35.450 --> 00:13:40.310
"For sale: baby
shoes, never worn."

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:41.330
That's quite intense.

00:13:41.330 --> 00:13:44.100
Six words only, there's
and entire world

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.510
behind these six words.

00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:47.600
And there's lots
that remains unsaid,

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.040
but there's lots that stimulates
perhaps your imagination.

00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.470
There's more to just the words.

00:13:52.470 --> 00:13:56.650
There's another layer, and
you or us as the readers

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:02.215
are stimulated to think, what
else is the story going on

00:14:02.215 --> 00:14:04.225
beyond those words and
behind those words?

00:14:04.225 --> 00:14:06.100
And so I was looking
for something like that.

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.630
Some way of
condensing all we know

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.020
about the universe,
all there is,

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:14.150
in a simple yet imaginative
and creative way.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.990
Now of course in physics, if you
think about physics and science

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:21.680
in general, we have
ways of condensing

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:25.420
a variety of phenomena
down in very simple terms.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.740
So for example, if we
think about electricity

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.380
and magnetism,
those are phenomena

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:33.260
that are ubiquitous
in our everyday lives,

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:37.170
from power generation to all
sorts of electrical tools

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:39.650
in our households, to
electricity, and lights,

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:45.660
and telecommunication, and power
again, turbine generation here.

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.660
All of those things are aspects
of the electrical and magnetic

00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:52.180
phenomena that very
much rule our lives,

00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:54.710
or certainly have a
big part in our lives.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.910
And yet all of this
variety of phenomena

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:04.150
are down to one single force,
the electromagnetic force which

00:15:04.150 --> 00:15:08.630
can be described in physics
using a very condensed and very

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.630
simple, in a sense, expression.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:15.660
A mathematical description which
boils down to this one equation

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:16.980
here.

00:15:16.980 --> 00:15:20.100
Now I won't unpack this one
equation for you necessarily,

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:24.710
but I just want to highlight
how physics in general

00:15:24.710 --> 00:15:27.880
is a quest for simplicity,
a quest for beauty,

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:29.020
a quest for symmetry.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.770
Although things are
condensed into equations

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:35.920
such as this one, which is a
compact form of writing down

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.990
the four Maxwell equations
that-- as you might remember

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:43.640
from high school or university
if you encountered those

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.480
before-- the four
Maxwell's equations

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.060
describe all of the
electromagnetical phenomena

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.060
that we know about.

00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.250
And they can all be written
down in one simple line,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.582
in one single equation,
this equation here.

00:15:53.582 --> 00:15:55.790
But the probem, of course
it that with this language,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:58.160
it takes-- in this
form, it will take

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.360
probably a major in
physics understand

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.950
what this form means.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.370
It is not a way of
presenting electromagnets

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.800
that we're using for our
undergrad physics students.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.580
And so while there is beauty,
simplicity, symmetry, elegance

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.420
even in equations such as
this, this is not something

00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:16.690
that we can use to
communicate with the public,

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.410
because of this
not only language

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:20.370
barrier but also
technical knowledge gap.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:22.490
So we need to go
beyond this and find

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:26.280
ways of unpacking the beauty
and elegance of equations

00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.780
such as this in a way
that's more immediate, more

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:31.090
understandable.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.390
Here is another
example, the universe

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:37.800
with all its plethora of
phenomena from galaxies

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:41.260
such as the Andromeda
galaxy-- our neighbor galaxy--

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.050
or binary stars that
eat up each other

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:47.890
and then explode
in a big explosion

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:50.740
at the end of their life, to
the distribution of clusters

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.730
in the sky and the dark
matter structures perhaps

00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:54.930
as well in the universe.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.160
All of this is largely
governed by gravity.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.509
And gravity, as
Einstein told us in 1915

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.800
with the discovery of the
general theory of relativity,

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.130
all of this can be written
down in one simple, elegant

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.450
equation, which is this,
Einstein's equation.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:14.760
It's a beautiful equation,
again very elegant, very dense,

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.460
very compact in a sense.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.349
And this equation is
telling us on this side

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:26.319
here that the shape
space time-- which

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:28.130
is described by
this symbol here--

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:33.550
is equal to the matter energy
content on that side here.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:35.490
And so what this
equation says in words

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:40.640
is that space time is bent
by the presence of mass.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:45.150
And mass reacts to the shape
of space time in its movement

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:45.750
through space.

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:47.583
And so for example,
what this equation tells

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:50.290
us is that gravity is not the
source like Newton thought

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:51.540
and like we learned in school.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.020
Gravity is a consequence of
the geometry of space time.

00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.620
And so when we
see the moon going

00:17:55.620 --> 00:17:58.490
around the Earth in a
circular orbit-- or so

00:17:58.490 --> 00:18:01.090
we think-- it's
not a force that's

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:04.300
keeping this satellite on track.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.730
What's happening is
the mass of the Earth

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:09.065
is changing the shape
of space time around it,

00:18:09.065 --> 00:18:11.190
and therefore the moon is
going in a straight path.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.390
Only a straight path in a bent
space time looks like a circle.

00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:18.830
And this is all beautifully
condensed into this one

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:20.020
equation.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:22.090
And so I was looking
for ways of expressing

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:26.250
all of that in a way that would
be understandable to people who

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:28.830
have not studied physics but
are nonetheless fascinated,

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.330
interested by all
of this phenomena.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:33.250
After all, the
cosmos is perhaps one

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.970
of the biggest
questions in science.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.290
Questions such as, where
does the universe come from?

00:18:39.290 --> 00:18:41.240
What will the destiny
of the universe be?

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.990
What is the fundamental
nature of reality?

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.060
These are questions that concern
us all at some very high level.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:47.560
But nonetheless,
these are questions

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.660
that fascinate the
public at large.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:53.830
So how do we talk about them
in a more immediate way?

00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:56.490
So I was thinking about
all of those things.

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.270
And I'd been thinking about all
of them for a long time now.

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:02.330
And then one day I
came across something

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:06.150
that was really impressing
and inspirational.

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:08.920
I came across the Up Goer Five.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.210
Now, I probably don't need to
explain to this audience what

00:19:12.210 --> 00:19:16.297
XKCD is, but in case you
are the new Google employee

00:19:16.297 --> 00:19:17.880
that just landed
from Mars and haven't

00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:20.280
heard of XKCD before, I'll
just say a few words about it.

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:26.730
XKCD is this wildly popular--
geeky, frankly-- geeky cartoon

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.130
on the web, which
is characterized

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.540
by a very peculiar
sense of humor.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:36.530
Sometimes those cartoons
are about physics,

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:37.909
and I get some of those.

00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:39.450
Often they're about
computer science,

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:41.650
and I don't get many
of those I must admit.

00:19:41.650 --> 00:19:43.025
And sometimes
they're very funny,

00:19:43.025 --> 00:19:45.282
and sometimes
they're just targeted

00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:49.020
at specific communities, and
so you don't get them all.

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:52.430
But Randall Munroe, the creator
of XKCD a year and a half

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.880
ago or so came up with this
idea of the Up Goer Five.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.170
As you can see, the Up Goer Five
is none other than the Saturn V

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.920
moon rocket with one
difference, with one twist.

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.790
And the twist was
that Randall thought

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:07.660
of labeling this
picture of the Saturn V

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:10.800
with limiting all of the
parts with only the most used

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:12.930
ten hundred words in
the English language.

00:20:12.930 --> 00:20:16.854
And so of course he couldn't
call it the Saturn V moon

00:20:16.854 --> 00:20:19.020
rocket, because "moon" is
not of the thousand words,

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.620
and "rocket" is not one
of the thousand words,

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.495
and "Saturn's" not one
of the thousand words.

00:20:22.495 --> 00:20:24.540
And so he named it
the Up Good Five.

00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.940
And instead of calling
it, NASA's Up Goer Five,

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:30.490
he called it US Space
Team's Up Goer Five.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:30.990
It's funny.

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.140
You should go through
the various parts.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.650
There are bits and pieces
that read like-- for example,

00:20:36.650 --> 00:20:39.820
here the escape module,
it's called the thing

00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.423
to help people escape really
fast if there's a problem

00:20:42.423 --> 00:20:44.506
and everything is on fire
so they decide not to go

00:20:44.506 --> 00:20:46.756
into space, which is a fair--
it's a good description,

00:20:46.756 --> 00:20:47.310
isn't it?

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.950
And if you go down,
down here there's

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:52.060
the oxygen tank called air
for burning and breathing.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:56.040
This part had a very big
problem once, true that.

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.562
And then here the
lunar module is

00:20:59.562 --> 00:21:02.020
the part that flies down to
the other world with two people

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.760
inside, and so on and so forth.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.260
So it was a fun and
interesting idea.

00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:08.330
And people picked it
up on the internet,

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.530
some people put
together a web page

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:14.400
where they challenged
users of that web page

00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:17.310
to write up their job
description using this thousand

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:18.414
words format.

00:21:18.414 --> 00:21:20.330
And so I tried that--
one day I came across it

00:21:20.330 --> 00:21:21.180
and I tried that.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:22.920
I spent half an
hour trying write up

00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:27.130
my job as an astrophysicist.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:31.470
And it was very hard, much
harder than you would imagine,

00:21:31.470 --> 00:21:33.580
because many, many of words
that you'd like to use

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:34.556
are not on the list.

00:21:34.556 --> 00:21:36.972
And it was quite surprising
to go through the list and see

00:21:36.972 --> 00:21:39.450
which words are on
it and which aren't.

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.240
And so I wrote up that piece,
maybe a couple paragraphs.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.670
It took me maybe the best
part of an hour to do so.

00:21:45.670 --> 00:21:48.570
I put it on my website and
then I forgot about it.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:50.410
And then a few
weeks later, I was

00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.090
giving a talk in
the White Building

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:55.420
in East London, which is an art
venue near the Olympic Park.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.710
And the person who introduced me
said a few words about myself.

00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:03.250
And they said that I
also had written my job

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:04.890
up using the thousand
most used words.

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:06.070
And they left it at that.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.810
I gave my talk.

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:09.880
And at the end of the Q&amp;A
session with the audience,

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.650
somebody asked a
question about, what

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:13.380
was this business
with 1,000 words.

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.430
I didn't understand what
this thing is about,

00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:16.120
can you explain?

00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:17.950
And so because I had
it on my computer,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:20.560
I read it allowed
to the audience.

00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.640
And I read out what I'd
written in this format.

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.000
And this was what I had.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:30.280
I study tiny bits of matter
that are all around us that we

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.875
cannot see, which
we call dark matter.

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:36.000
We know dark matter is out
there because it changes

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.990
the way other big
far away things move

00:22:38.990 --> 00:22:41.250
such a stars and star crowds.

00:22:41.250 --> 00:22:42.990
We want to understand
what dark matter is

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.281
made of because it could tell
us about where everything

00:22:45.281 --> 00:22:47.290
around us came from and
what will happen next.

00:22:48.326 --> 00:22:49.700
To study dark
matter, people like

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.640
me use big things that have
taken lots of money, thought,

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.280
and people to build.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.660
Some of the things
fly way above us.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.070
Some are deep inside the ground.

00:22:59.070 --> 00:23:02.460
Some are large rings that make
tiny pieces of mobile matter

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.870
kiss each other as they fly
around very, very fast, almost

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:06.790
as fast as light.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.534
We hope that we can hear
the whisper of dark matter

00:23:10.534 --> 00:23:11.700
if we listen very carefully.

00:23:12.867 --> 00:23:15.200
We take all the whispers from
all the [INAUDIBLE] things

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.949
and we put them together
in our computers.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.060
We use big computers
to do this, as there

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:22.560
are lots and lots of tiny
whispers we need to look at.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.220
I go to places
all over the world

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.530
to talk to other people
like me, as together we

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:29.980
can think better
and work faster.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:32.230
Together perhaps, we can
even find new better ways

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.210
to listen to dark matter.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.420
Most of them are good people,
and after we've talked,

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.410
we go out and have a
drink, and talk some more.

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:42.550
So I read this aloud,
and I was astonished

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:45.960
by the reaction of the
public because everybody

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:47.950
was taken aback by this format.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:50.150
They weren't expecting
it to be quite like that.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:54.370
And so I got a very warm round
of applause, which was actually

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:56.930
much better than the applause
that I got for my talk.

00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:59.555
I was encouraged by
it, because I thought,

00:23:59.555 --> 00:24:01.690
well actually
there is something.

00:24:01.690 --> 00:24:04.920
Perhaps this format is just
what I was looking for.

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.680
Perhaps in this thousand words
there is something hidden

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.990
and it would be an
interesting and fun challenge

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:14.880
to try to describe the
entirety of all there is.

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.530
Of course, universe
is not on the list,

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:19.765
so the universe became the all
there is with this format here.

00:24:19.765 --> 00:24:22.030
And so that's what
I started doing.

00:24:22.030 --> 00:24:24.000
I started sitting
down, and I tried

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.420
to see whether this format
could be expanded beyond three

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.340
paragraphs to book length.

00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:32.610
And again, I was very
lucky because a few months

00:24:32.610 --> 00:24:37.074
after that, in April, I
had time to spend here

00:24:37.074 --> 00:24:38.990
at the University of
California Santa Barbara.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:41.124
And that is the view
out of my office window.

00:24:41.124 --> 00:24:43.040
So The Edge of the Sky,
the title of the book,

00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:46.500
probably came out
of this moment here

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:50.240
that I was so lucky to have
a three month long research

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.220
stay at Santa Barbara.

00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:54.770
And so I had time and
intellectual freedom

00:24:54.770 --> 00:24:57.360
to do research, of course,
but also to devote myself

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.510
a little bit to
exploring this format

00:24:59.510 --> 00:25:01.690
and to explore the
thousand words idea.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:03.440
And to see whether
it could be stretched

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:05.750
to encompass the all there is.

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:07.910
And so all of a
sudden I find myself

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:10.760
battling against this
self-imposed lexicon,

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.024
this straitjacket.

00:25:12.024 --> 00:25:13.440
There were many,
many words that I

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.740
would have liked to use to
describe the universe which

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.770
I didn't have.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:20.790
And so I started banging
my head against it.

00:25:20.790 --> 00:25:24.330
I wanted to explain in entire
history and entire knowledge

00:25:24.330 --> 00:25:26.930
of the universe, but without
using the word "universe".

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:29.600
Without using the word
"gravity", or "telescope",

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.740
or "particle", or "earth".

00:25:31.740 --> 00:25:33.570
"Planet" was not on
the list. "Energy",

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:35.060
so there wasn't even "energy".

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.910
"Cosmos", of course not.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.620
"Big Bang" wasn't on the list.

00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.887
"Galaxy", "scientist".

00:25:40.887 --> 00:25:42.720
I couldn't talk about
science nor scientist.

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.440
Nor the moon was on the list.

00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:46.120
And not even fog
was on the list,

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:47.780
which is an important
word for people

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.000
who live in the Bay Area.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.610
They talk about
fog all the time.

00:25:50.610 --> 00:25:52.910
And you think, but why do I need
fog to describe the universe?

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:54.576
But it turns out that
the early universe

00:25:54.576 --> 00:25:56.924
can be described as a sort
of fog, high energy fog.

00:25:56.924 --> 00:25:58.840
But I couldn't use energy,
I couldn't use fog.

00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.800
I could use high, but
that's not very good, right?

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:04.990
So what I needed to do
was to try and invent

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:07.820
a new set of vocabulary
really to be talking

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.930
about all there is with a
very different set of words.

00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:14.820
And little by little a
new voice came together.

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.360
A voice that sort of came
out of the challenge itself.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.040
And the book has
its own voice that

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.300
was a co-creation between
what I wanted to say

00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.850
and what the lexicon--
the thousand word list--

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:25.640
allowed me to say.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:29.310
And so a telescope
became a big seer.

00:26:29.310 --> 00:26:31.430
The universe became
the all there is.

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:34.080
And plants became crazy
stars because they

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.340
go around projecting
motion on the sky.

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:38.720
The pattern of motion in
the sky is back and forth.

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:39.970
And so it's a crazy star.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.750
It doesn't go around
like all of the stars.

00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:44.860
Particles became drops.

00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.180
Our planet, the Earth,
became our home world.

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:51.120
And scientists are
student people,

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.870
or student persons in the book.

00:26:54.470 --> 00:26:56.580
The moon is the sun's sister.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:58.600
Sun is on the list,
so I could use that.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.950
And galaxies are star crowds.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:04.460
Now, the Big Bang
was easy, I thought,

00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:07.450
because I can't use a
bang but I can use flash.

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.352
And it was a hot beginning,
so I'll call it the hot flash.

00:27:12.352 --> 00:27:14.560
But then my editor told me
that the hot flash was not

00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.000
a good word to use for that.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.284
And so I changed it to big
flash, so I learned something.

00:27:19.284 --> 00:27:20.700
And so out of this
new vocabulary,

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.550
a new voice emerged.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.490
A new way of looking at
the universe emerged.

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:28.730
And here, at the end of the
book, here's the cloud of words

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.525
that I ended up using.

00:27:30.525 --> 00:27:32.630
707 words all together.

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:34.670
And you can see that
there's lots of dark,

00:27:34.670 --> 00:27:37.169
because there's lots of dark
stuff in the book, dark energy,

00:27:37.169 --> 00:27:37.780
dark matter.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:38.820
Of course, the dark energy
is not called. that.

00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.060
It's called the dark push.

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.599
People are mostly
student people,

00:27:42.599 --> 00:27:43.640
that's to say scientists.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.170
Drops for particles.

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:48.770
Away, far away is big, because
there's lots of faraway things.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:53.660
Light, space, crazy-- for crazy
stars-- seer-- for big seer--

00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:54.600
and so on.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.080
And so really it becomes
a different language.

00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.810
It's almost like
creating a new language

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.610
to talk about the things.

00:28:01.610 --> 00:28:04.490
So today what I
want to do, I want

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:08.690
to share some of the bits of
the voice that came out of this

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.000
and also share some of the
science that's behind it.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.730
But before I do so,
I wanted to give you

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:17.210
a little condensed
version of the book.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.120
Each of the 10
chapters of the book

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:23.260
begins with a very short
haiku style three-liner

00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:24.090
form of poetry.

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:26.720
So haiku is this
Japanese form of poetry

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.090
which is condensed in just
three verses, which is often

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:34.270
very imagery heavy
and very condensed.

00:28:34.270 --> 00:28:36.990
And so it's just
a flash of words

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:38.280
that tries to evoke something.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.400
And so I tried to
condense each chapter down

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.840
to just three lines.

00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:43.570
And so there is 10 chapters.

00:28:43.570 --> 00:28:46.020
And so in 85 words,
think of this

00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.440
as the pseudo code to
the book if you like.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.970
So that's a double-condensed
version of the universe.

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:53.470
So the book contains 707 words.

00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:56.335
But actually, here is the
entire [INAUDIBLE] universe

00:28:56.335 --> 00:28:59.610
in 85 words in this
double-condensed form.

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.000
"In the clear night, her
dark hair mirrors the stars.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.840
Blue worlds going
around, points of light.

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.895
Behind the stars, space
time grows silent.

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.190
Hot kisses leave
light very tired.

00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.685
Her pink lips stay dry
in the heavy dark rain.

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.875
A soft song might
tell you dark stories.

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.340
With the last breath,
and blushing of light

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:29.255
from faraway stars.

00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:33.580
A silent end, times of
light half remembered.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.620
So many worlds,
all that can be is.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.880
Everything opens at the
smallest touch of a rose."

00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:44.621
So that's the
[INAUDIBLE] of all there

00:29:44.621 --> 00:29:47.120
is, the entire contents of the
book boiled down to 85 words.

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.120
It might be a little
bit too dense,

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.320
so let me unpack it for
you, and step back, and just

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:56.080
tell you a little bit the
storyline of the book.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.740
Because the book story
came out as a conversation,

00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:02.620
really, as a distillation
of hundreds of talks

00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:04.146
that I'd given
before-- public talks

00:30:04.146 --> 00:30:07.300
that I've given to all sorts of
people in different settings.

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.920
So the story came
very naturally to me.

00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.750
I was very lucky that
I had already in mind

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:15.680
when I started writing the
book what I wanted to tell.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.480
And it's a story that begins
with a student woman--

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.235
a fictional character-- here
she is, walking up to big seer.

00:30:25.235 --> 00:30:27.110
There are two characters
really in this book.

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:32.150
One is the student woman who is
a student person who goes out

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:35.420
for the first time to one of
the biggest telescopes on earth,

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:38.540
big seer, for a
night of observation

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:42.230
to study dark matter and try to
crack the dark matter mystery.

00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:44.370
So here she is
walking up to big seer

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:49.160
in this beautiful illustration
that accompanies the book.

00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:51.050
I was very lucky
to have [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.110
a very talented young
artist and illustrator

00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:59.480
who produced and created the
beautiful line drawings that

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.000
accompany the book.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.990
And so, our student person,
she goes up to big seer.

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.090
Big seer is the second
character in his book.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.650
It's the silent helper,
it's the big telescope

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:11.562
that helps her in
trying to unlock

00:31:11.562 --> 00:31:12.770
the mysteries of dark matter.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.769
So it's like a fictionalized
version of reality.

00:31:14.769 --> 00:31:17.090
Of course, in reality
scientists do not

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:20.590
go out to telescopes on top
of mountains like Hawaii,

00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:23.150
for example, working
alone at 12,000 feet

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:24.840
because that
wouldn't be possible.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:29.060
But still, that's a
fictional version of reality

00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:33.140
that allows us to follow
her night of observation

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:36.590
and her questions about the
all there is, the way it became

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:39.520
to be what it is today and all
the questions that we still

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:43.347
have about its nature
and its properties.

00:31:43.347 --> 00:31:44.930
She in particular
is out there looking

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:47.179
for that matter, which is
one of the biggest mysteries

00:31:47.179 --> 00:31:49.290
today and one that
can be probably solved

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:52.750
by science in the next five
years or so, or so we hope.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:57.340
So our scientist goes out and
makes observations of the sky.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.680
And what is she looking for?

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.320
Let's take a step back.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:06.260
Here is a picture of
Edwin Hubble, 1927,

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:09.324
the discover of what is
now called Hubble's Law.

00:32:09.324 --> 00:32:10.990
The fact that the
universe is expanding,

00:32:10.990 --> 00:32:15.880
which Hubble discovered
by looking at distant star

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.679
crowds-- that's to say galaxies.

00:32:17.679 --> 00:32:19.220
At the time they
were called nebulae.

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:20.275
People didn't know
what they were.

00:32:20.275 --> 00:32:22.920
They didn't even know whether
they were inside or outside

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.020
the wide world-- that's to say
the Milky Way, our own galaxy.

00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.550
But what Hubble discovered
was that he charted out

00:32:30.550 --> 00:32:35.060
the velocity of those
distant star crowds

00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:37.690
as a function of the
distance from us.

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.990
And so each one of those
dots is a measurement

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:44.770
that he took working
not far away from here

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.140
in southern California.

00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:51.630
And what he saw, he realized
that as objects are further

00:32:51.630 --> 00:32:55.210
away from us here, they're
also traveling at faster speeds

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:56.695
and are receding from us.

00:32:56.695 --> 00:32:58.010
They're moving away from us.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:00.405
And what he did, he
very boldly drew a line

00:33:00.405 --> 00:33:02.720
through those points
and said, here

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.170
there is a linear relationship.

00:33:04.170 --> 00:33:06.680
There is a relationship between
how far away objects are

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.250
and how far they're moving.

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:11.765
And the slope of this line here,
the slope of this relationship

00:33:11.765 --> 00:33:14.460
is to do is day
called Hubble's Law.

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.980
And this Hubble's Law is telling
us that far away galaxies

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.290
are moving away from us
faster than nearby galaxies.

00:33:22.290 --> 00:33:25.900
And this is only possible if the
entire universe is expanding.

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:28.575
In other words, the picture
that emerged from this discovery

00:33:28.575 --> 00:33:31.602
is that galaxies are moving
away from each other.

00:33:31.602 --> 00:33:33.560
And they're moving away
faster the further away

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:35.280
they are as a
consequence of the fact

00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.180
that space time itself between
galaxies is stretching.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:41.950
It's expanding just like the
pizza dough that we saw before.

00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:43.810
But the astonishing
thing is that if we now

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:48.090
turn this thing upside down and
we look at time going backwards

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:49.950
in the backwards
direction, he thinks

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:52.960
if galaxies are moving
away from each other today,

00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:56.230
this means that they were
together in the past--

00:33:56.230 --> 00:33:57.989
or they were closer
by in the past.

00:33:57.989 --> 00:33:59.780
And if you go even
further back in the past

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:00.863
they were closer together.

00:34:00.863 --> 00:34:02.860
And if you can go even
further back in time,

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.660
there comes a point where all
these galaxies were heaped up

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:08.850
on top of each other, which
is what we call the Big Bang.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:10.670
So the astonishing
discovery that Hubble

00:34:10.670 --> 00:34:12.710
made almost 100
years ago now was

00:34:12.710 --> 00:34:14.170
that the universe is expanding.

00:34:14.170 --> 00:34:17.870
And it all came from an
initial hot, dense point

00:34:17.870 --> 00:34:19.580
that we now call the Big Bang.

00:34:20.947 --> 00:34:22.530
And so this was what
Hubble discovered

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.620
with only a handful
of observations,

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.580
maybe 30, 40
galaxies he measured.

00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.270
That's all.

00:34:27.270 --> 00:34:29.590
But nowadays of
course, our discipline

00:34:29.590 --> 00:34:31.570
has moved on very much.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:34.150
And so we are very
much entering the world

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.560
of big data, which is
something that people here

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.830
know a lot about of course.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:40.820
And so you can see
here, this graph

00:34:40.820 --> 00:34:44.820
is an extension of what
Hubble saw in 1927.

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:47.240
So Hubble only saw
this little corner here

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:52.380
of this diagram where he put
that line through these dots.

00:34:52.380 --> 00:34:54.257
We have been now able
to extend this diagram

00:34:54.257 --> 00:34:55.340
to much further distances.

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.730
And that's a picture
from the paper

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:01.160
that I quoted in the beginning,
the 1999 [INAUDIBLE] paper that

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.910
was awarded the Nobel Prize
for physics a few years ago.

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:06.740
And this was the status in 1999.

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:10.030
In 2010 you can see how many
more data points we have,

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:13.090
and how this expansion
of the universe

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:16.070
is being charted out with
greater and greater precision.

00:35:16.070 --> 00:35:18.740
Here are observations of the
relic radiation from the Big

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:22.210
Bang, the remnants
of the Big Bang.

00:35:22.210 --> 00:35:27.190
In 1994 the discovery of the
microwave echo of the Big Bang

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:28.200
with the COBE satellite.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.860
Again, Nobel Prize for physics.

00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:34.450
2001 the WMAP satellite
measures the same radiation

00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:36.130
but with a much
higher resolution.

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:38.600
And now the Planck satellite,
the latest instrument,

00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:41.360
has observed the sky with
even greater resolution.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.880
We can see how many
more details we

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:45.130
can see from this light
that comes straight

00:35:45.130 --> 00:35:46.460
from the Big Bang.

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:48.540
Here galaxies in the sky.

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:52.420
In 1985 there was a state of
the art 1,100 galaxies observed.

00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.091
Each one of those dots
is a galaxy on the sky.

00:35:55.091 --> 00:35:57.590
And this is the state of the
art today, one million galaxies

00:35:57.590 --> 00:35:59.170
from the [INAUDIBLE] Sky Survey.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:01.690
Each one of those
colored dots is a galaxy.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.250
And when the square
kilometer array

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:06.470
comes online in
about 10 years time--

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.320
which will be an array of
radio telescope spread over two

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:14.520
continents-- we'll measure
the position and distance

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.680
of tens of millions of
galaxies in the sky.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.510
So this is what big data
now means in our field.

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.810
And what have we learned?

00:36:21.810 --> 00:36:24.660
So let's have a look
at a patch of the sky.

00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:27.270
Let's have a look at the
patch of the sky which

00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.390
is pictured here.

00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:30.181
So you can see here,
there's the full moon.

00:36:30.181 --> 00:36:32.330
The full moon is about
half a degree on the sky

00:36:32.330 --> 00:36:34.950
if you look at it from here.

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:36.990
And everybody knows
what the full moon

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:38.480
looks like on the sky.

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.820
And here is a little
patch of that same sky

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:44.730
in which is singled
out this yellow square.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:46.750
So this is a tiny
little patch of the sky.

00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:50.420
To give you an idea of how
small this yellow square is,

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:52.485
it is the same
amount of sky that

00:36:52.485 --> 00:36:56.605
would fit inside the eye of a
needle held at arm's length.

00:36:56.605 --> 00:36:58.440
So it's tiny.

00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.840
And yet if you look at it with
the most powerful telescopes

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.130
that we have, the
Hubble Space Telescope,

00:37:04.130 --> 00:37:05.750
this is what you see.

00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:10.390
There are 505,000 galaxies
inside that eye of the needle.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:12.790
And each one of those galaxies
contains about 100 billion

00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:15.690
stars, just like the
Milky Way, our galaxy,

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:18.926
contains about a few
hundred billion stars.

00:37:18.926 --> 00:37:21.300
And if I zoom in, you can see
that each one of those dots

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:22.337
indeed is a galaxy.

00:37:22.337 --> 00:37:23.920
You can see beautiful
spiral galaxies,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.670
and you can see other more
regularly shaped galaxies,

00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:27.694
and so on and so forth.

00:37:27.694 --> 00:37:29.110
And so all of those
galaxies, they

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:31.130
fit within this eye of a needle.

00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:32.870
So you can imagine
how many more there

00:37:32.870 --> 00:37:35.790
are in the entire universe
as we cover the entire sky.

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:38.210
And yet, perhaps the most
astonishing discovery

00:37:38.210 --> 00:37:41.220
of modern cosmology
is that this is only

00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.690
a fraction of what is out there.

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:46.020
So the headline news is
that 96% of the universe

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.870
is actually missing.

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:51.030
So what is this dark
side of the universe?

00:37:51.030 --> 00:37:54.890
What is all the rest that's
out there that does not show up

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:58.100
in that picture and doesn't
show up in any of the pictures?

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:02.432
Well, we now know that the
luminous matter-- stars

00:38:02.432 --> 00:38:04.390
and luminous galaxies--
this tiny little sliver

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:08.150
of the cosmic sky, this
tiny little bit here,

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:10.290
all the rest here,
the red bit here

00:38:10.290 --> 00:38:12.145
is other non-luminous
components in the form

00:38:12.145 --> 00:38:14.162
of intergalactic
gas, and neutrinos,

00:38:14.162 --> 00:38:16.120
and super massive black
holes, and so on, which

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:17.947
is all stuff that's
made of particles that

00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:20.950
are the same kind of particles
that we are made off.

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.280
So this part here is the
tiny fraction of the universe

00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.660
that we know about.

00:38:24.660 --> 00:38:27.980
But the largest
majority of the universe

00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:31.630
is made of dark, invisible,
unknown, as of yet undiscovered

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:32.130
stuff.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:37.530
Dark matter 23% or so of
the universe and dark energy

00:38:37.530 --> 00:38:40.529
the biggest part of the pie.

00:38:40.529 --> 00:38:42.070
What in the book is
called dark push.

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.830
And so one of the biggest
mysteries of cosmology

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:49.300
is precisely to try and work out
what this 95% of the universe

00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.240
is made of.

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:52.860
What is the fundamental
nature of all the stuff

00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:54.290
that we don't know about?

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.260
But fortunately,
we now have means

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.390
of doing that with
data, with very

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:01.560
sophisticated observations.

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:04.620
Remember, cosmology
is a time machine.

00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.160
In other words, the
speed of light is finite.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:09.380
And being finite, it means
that the further out you

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:12.310
look in the universe, the
further back in time you see.

00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:14.960
Because light takes time
to travel from the furthest

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.390
objects to us.

00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:18.750
300,000 kilometers per
second is the speed of light,

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:20.710
so every time you look at the
sun, you're looking at the sun

00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:22.860
not as it is now but
you're looking at the sun

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.970
as it was eight minutes ago
because that's how long it

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:28.571
takes for light to cover the 150
million kilometers between us

00:39:28.571 --> 00:39:29.070
and the sun.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:30.630
So if you look at
distant galaxies,

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.030
you see them not as they
are "now", quote, unquote,

00:39:33.030 --> 00:39:35.020
but as they were
billions of years

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.470
ago when that light first left.

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:42.257
And so if you look back
further out in space,

00:39:42.257 --> 00:39:43.840
if you use the Hubble
Space Telescope,

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:47.770
that's pretty much how far back
in space and time we can look,

00:39:47.770 --> 00:39:48.880
a few billion years ago.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:52.100
But if you use different types
of light, like microwave light

00:39:52.100 --> 00:39:56.950
and microwave satellites, we
can go back all the way almost

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.340
to the Big Bang.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:03.180
And so we can pick up light
that left just 380,000 years

00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:06.900
after the Big Bang, which is
the end of the visible universe.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:09.250
And this is what we see.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.700
This is a picture of the
sky taken in microwaves.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.800
And that's a picture that
shows the baby universe.

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.810
This light left
when the universe

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.490
was a tiny, tiny fraction
of its current age.

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.520
The current age of the universe
is about 13.7 billion years,

00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:24.290
and this light has
been en route almost

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:25.360
since the very beginning.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.910
And what you see
here is a picture

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:30.090
of the universe where
there are no galaxies yet,

00:40:30.090 --> 00:40:32.160
because there was no time
for galaxies to form.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.500
No stars yet.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:38.870
All there is is matter, light,
photons, and dark matter.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:40.520
What you see here
is the red spots

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:44.450
are spots of slightly larger
concentration of energy,

00:40:44.450 --> 00:40:49.470
and light, and matter, which
are the seeds of what then will

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.250
become galaxies such
as the Milky Way.

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:55.374
And so this picture here is the
end of the visible universe.

00:40:55.374 --> 00:40:56.790
And I don't mean
it as a metaphor,

00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:59.804
I mean it as a
scientific statement

00:40:59.804 --> 00:41:01.970
because there's no way we
can see past this picture.

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:06.300
The universe was opaque
to light before this time,

00:41:06.300 --> 00:41:09.440
because it was too energetic
for light to travel freely.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.340
Light kept bouncing off
electrons and protons

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.350
in the early universe.

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:17.619
And so this early universe
picture, which we can see,

00:41:17.619 --> 00:41:19.035
can be described
as a sort of fog.

00:41:19.035 --> 00:41:21.820
It was a high energy fog,
2,000 Kelvin temperature.

00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.430
So almost 2,000 degrees Celsius.

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:28.630
But in the book, of course,
I couldn't talk about it

00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:33.580
in terms of fog, because there
is no fog in the list of words.

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.965
So here's how this
early universe picture

00:41:35.965 --> 00:41:38.340
is described using
the thousand words.

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.790
"It was like when you look out
your window on a cold morning.

00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:46.179
There's ice on the road,
and everything looks gray,

00:41:46.179 --> 00:41:47.720
and you can't see
past your driveway.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.690
This is because light gets
kicked about by tiny water

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:54.010
drops in the air before
reaching your eyes.

00:41:54.856 --> 00:41:56.230
Something like
this was happening

00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:58.910
at that time", that's to
say, at the very beginning,

00:41:58.910 --> 00:42:03.370
"only everything was 100 times
hotter than on a hot summer's

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:04.556
day.

00:42:04.556 --> 00:42:06.970
And so this is just
a simple description

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:09.300
of what the universe looked
like at the very beginning.

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.800
And then things started
to change, and evolve,

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.720
and galaxies grew out of it.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.420
And gravity started
doing its job.

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:20.070
And gravity, as I told you
before, is not at all a force.

00:42:20.070 --> 00:42:22.780
It's just a reflection on
the shape of space time.

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.020
So here's how this
can be described

00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:28.330
using the thousand
words lexicon.

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:31.280
So this is a crash course in
generativity in one paragraph

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:32.920
and less than 1,000
words in English.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:38.730
So talking about Einstein here
and how he thought gravity

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.140
was different from
Newton's gravity.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:42.880
"He", that's to
say Mr. Einstein,

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.880
"then asked himself,
what would happen

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.920
if you put some heavy
stuff-- as heavy

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.540
as a star in the
middle of space time?

00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:52.740
He was the first to understand
that matter puts in space

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:54.770
time and changes
the way it looks.

00:42:54.770 --> 00:42:57.400
In turn, the form
of space time is

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.935
what moves matter
one way or another.

00:42:59.935 --> 00:43:01.810
As an idea, this was
very different from what

00:43:01.810 --> 00:43:03.700
Mr. Newton had said
a long time ago.

00:43:03.700 --> 00:43:06.610
For Mr. Newton, space and time
did not talk to each other,

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:09.870
never married, and
lived different lives."

00:43:09.870 --> 00:43:12.210
And then it goes on
describing how this idea could

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:14.900
be tested using a solar
eclipse, because of course

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.030
exceptional claims need
exceptional means of evidence.

00:43:18.030 --> 00:43:21.150
And so in 1919 Einstein's
idea of generativity

00:43:21.150 --> 00:43:24.870
was proven proven right by
observations of a solar eclipse

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.780
here in one of the illustrations
of the book that actually

00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.040
proved that light was
being moved around

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:36.080
and changing trajectory
along the bent space

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.880
time exactly like
Einstein predicted.

00:43:38.880 --> 00:43:44.660
So here is the backdrop of
what the student person is

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:48.910
trying to do with
our observations.

00:43:48.910 --> 00:43:51.670
And all of these observations
that I told you about,

00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:54.160
they paint a very strange
picture of the universe.

00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.560
A picture of the
universe where again we

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.290
have a very puzzling
universe, a universe where

00:43:59.290 --> 00:44:02.850
we have dark matter, again
these omega numbers that make it

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:05.490
look as if we know what we're
talking about-- but in reality

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.660
we just hide our ignorance
behind Greek letters.

00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:10.930
And so the amount of dark matter
that there is in the universe

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.650
has been now measured
very precisely

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:14.890
using its gravitational
effect in the cosmos,

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:19.530
about 26.6% with a
few percent around it.

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:21.180
And then there's
another, and possibly

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.860
a new type of particle beyond
[INAUDIBLE] particle physics.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.190
And then there is dark
energy, the dark push,

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.440
the mysterious force that's
making the universe expand

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:33.610
faster and faster all the time,
which makes up 70% or more

00:44:33.610 --> 00:44:35.979
68.6% of the universe.

00:44:35.979 --> 00:44:38.270
And those two things together
are very much mysterious.

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.436
We don't know what they are.

00:44:40.230 --> 00:44:42.680
One thing we've learned
actually very precisely,

00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.290
which is the age
of the universe.

00:44:44.290 --> 00:44:49.280
Now the age of the universe
is 13,798,000 years,

00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:52.200
which is astonishing
to be able to quote

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:56.850
this figure within a margin of
error of 37 million years only.

00:44:56.850 --> 00:44:58.350
That's nothing at all.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.744
I mean, we sit on the
earth, it's right here,

00:45:00.744 --> 00:45:03.160
and yet we don't know the age
of the earth with precision.

00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:04.910
And we can tell the
age of the universe

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:07.000
with incredible accuracy.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.260
It's an accuracy that's
really astonishing.

00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:15.750
Let's put this into
perspective with 1,000 words.

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:17.560
"This is really
great if you think

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.185
how long ago the
big flash happened.

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:24.370
It was over 100 times 100
times 100 times 100 times

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:26.070
100 years ago.

00:45:26.070 --> 00:45:28.600
We know the age of
the order so well

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.420
that it would be like
being able to tell

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:32.770
the day of the year a
stranger in the street

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:38.130
came to life to the nearest
day just by looking at him."

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:42.650
And that's one of the great
discoveries of cosmology

00:45:42.650 --> 00:45:45.310
that comes out of mapping
out the tiny ripples

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:48.360
in the microwave radiation in
the voluminous echo of the Big

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:50.330
Bang we were talking
about before.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.677
And I don't want to go into
details of the technicalities,

00:45:53.677 --> 00:45:55.510
but I do want to show
you one picture that's

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.580
quite astonishing, I think.

00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.220
It's slightly
technical, but again I

00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:01.480
think people here will
appreciate the idea of data

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:04.990
compression and how we can
compress a large amount of data

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:06.870
into just a few numbers.

00:46:06.870 --> 00:46:10.130
So here we have our micro
satellite sending down

00:46:10.130 --> 00:46:12.870
a stream of data, a
stream of points, 10

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:16.220
to the 12 bits of data that go
into making this map of the sky

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:19.030
that I told you before, 50
million pixels that then gets

00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:23.160
reduced by statistical
massaging into a plot which

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:26.370
has got 2,500
measurements points on it.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:28.210
And this plot how much
fluctuations there

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:29.836
are on this map as
a function of scale.

00:46:29.836 --> 00:46:31.793
It doesn't really matter
the technical details,

00:46:31.793 --> 00:46:33.850
but what I want to
show you is this plot,

00:46:33.850 --> 00:46:36.930
which is derived from the
microwave [INAUDIBLE] map,

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:38.990
the map of the light
from the Big Bang.

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:42.690
And you can see the data
points here which are in red.

00:46:42.690 --> 00:46:45.140
And they follow a very
interesting oscillatory

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.340
wave-like pattern,
a pattern that we

00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:50.380
can understand using [INAUDIBLE]
level physics in very

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:53.160
great detail, because this is
physics of the universe which

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:56.260
we understand with
very high precision.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.180
And this is proven by the
fact that we can-- right now

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:01.865
the theoretical model, a theory
of the universe, of the all

00:47:01.865 --> 00:47:04.850
there is, that contains
three different ingredients.

00:47:04.850 --> 00:47:07.480
One is Einstein
generativity, the other one

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:09.750
is the Big Bang as a
theory, and the other one

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:12.420
is these dark components--
dark matter, dark energy,

00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.624
or the dark push as I put it.

00:47:14.624 --> 00:47:16.790
And you could see that this
theoretical model, which

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.800
has got only six numbers
in it, six free parameters,

00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:20.987
is the green line.

00:47:20.987 --> 00:47:23.070
It goes through the
observations almost perfectly.

00:47:23.070 --> 00:47:25.370
So we understand the
observation incredibly well,

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.680
all the way if we extend
the horizontal axis,

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.690
we understand them all the
way to the smallest details

00:47:31.690 --> 00:47:36.570
down here, down into this
tail of distribution.

00:47:36.570 --> 00:47:38.350
And so what I want
to say with this

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.520
is that we have this
incredible wealth

00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:41.900
of data about the universe.

00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:44.840
We've got these incredible
sophisticated models.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:49.030
And yet, to make them work, to
make the models match the data,

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.935
we need these two
unknown ingredients.

00:47:50.935 --> 00:47:53.460
We need dark matter,
we need dark energy,

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.070
and we don't know what they are.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:58.510
And this is one of the
biggest quests at the moment.

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.260
So how does our
student person go

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.670
about understanding dark
matter and dark energy?

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:09.610
So during her night
of observations

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.480
she is thinking about
those mysteries,

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:15.330
and how they are
very much unsolved,

00:48:15.330 --> 00:48:17.900
and what we can do to try
and understand them better.

00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:23.420
So when she casts her mind's
eye back to the dark push,

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:25.850
this is what goes
on in her mind.

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:28.770
"She steps outside
in the cold night,

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:31.670
holding her cup of hot
coffee with both hands.

00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:35.130
The wide world is beautiful,
the dark clear sky.

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.260
And once again, she can't
help but be amazed by it all.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.950
It doesn't matter how many
times she's seen this before

00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:44.570
or how much she knows
about what is out there.

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:46.965
The site of the stars is
enough to make her gasp.

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:53.230
It all seems so still, and yet
it's changing all the time,

00:48:53.230 --> 00:48:55.352
she whispers to no one.

00:48:55.352 --> 00:48:57.310
It is hard to believe
that everything out there

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:00.870
past the wide world and it
starts is running away from us.

00:49:02.230 --> 00:49:05.250
Yet, like Mr. Hubble
found long ago,

00:49:05.250 --> 00:49:07.820
the star crowds are running
away from each other

00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:10.880
at the space between them
gets bigger and bigger.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.080
The all there is is
growing with time."

00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.380
And that's what the dark
push or dark energy is doing.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:19.180
A repulsive force,
possibly a new type

00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:22.120
of a vacuum energy-- and energy
associated with empty space

00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.120
itself-- that's
pushing things apart.

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.690
And the big mystery is that
this dark energy not only

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:28.950
is something that we don't
understand fundamentally,

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:33.640
it's something that could even
be pointing to what I call

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:40.630
the dark side of the universe
here, because one of the ideas

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.070
to explain the existence
of this dark push

00:49:44.070 --> 00:49:47.090
is to postulate the
existence of a multiverse.

00:49:47.090 --> 00:49:50.340
A grander scheme
of reality in which

00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:54.430
we are but only but a
tiny little bit of what

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:55.020
is out there.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.490
So the all there is, all the
stuff that I told you about--

00:49:57.490 --> 00:49:59.073
and this is very
speculative, but it's

00:49:59.073 --> 00:50:01.110
just one of the ideas
that can be invoked

00:50:01.110 --> 00:50:03.940
to explain the origin of the
dark push or dark energy.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:07.610
So the idea is that all there is
is only a tiny fraction of what

00:50:07.610 --> 00:50:09.290
reality is actually made of.

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:13.310
That our universe
itself, presumably

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.485
of infinite spatial
extent, is but a tiny bit

00:50:16.485 --> 00:50:18.760
of a grander reality
called the multiverse which

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.800
is depicted here by
these different bubbles.

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.302
And these different bubbles
represent different corners

00:50:23.302 --> 00:50:24.760
of the multiverse,
each one of them

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.180
with different laws of physics.

00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:29.610
And those laws of physics
varying across the multiverse

00:50:29.610 --> 00:50:31.670
that could explain why
our universe appears

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:36.540
to be so strange with a dark
energy content that appears

00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:38.421
to be strangely
fine tuned for life

00:50:38.421 --> 00:50:39.920
to be able to exist
in our universe.

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:42.390
And so this is what is called
the entropic principle,

00:50:42.390 --> 00:50:45.380
the idea that we live in a
corner of the multiverse that's

00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:48.200
good for life not because
our universe is strangely

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.150
fine tuned, but because we
as biological life forms

00:50:52.150 --> 00:50:54.860
need for a long-leaved
cold universe

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:59.000
with a stable rocky planet
going around a star.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.710
We must be in a corner
of the multiverse

00:51:00.710 --> 00:51:02.950
where the fundamental
constants of nature

00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:06.720
are such that will allow this
kind of ecosystem to emerge.

00:51:06.720 --> 00:51:10.240
And so if we had a larger
reality like the multiverse

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.510
with a large number of
possible universes to try life,

00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:16.820
we'd only be found in a corner
of the multiverse that's

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:20.500
just right, and therefore that
would appear fine tuned to us.

00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.680
So here's the idea of the
multiverse, a collection

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.110
of perhaps up to 10 to the
500 parallel universes, which

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:28.232
is this spectacularly large
number of parallel universes,

00:51:28.232 --> 00:51:30.190
each one of them with
different laws of physics

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:35.010
and different ways of mixing
the constants of nature.

00:51:35.010 --> 00:51:37.890
And we will be found in one
special place, a place where

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:39.980
everything is just
right for us to exist.

00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:45.910
Not us as human beings, but
as examples of biological life

00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:47.980
forms that need very
special conditions.

00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:50.120
And so these are
all ideas that go on

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.410
in the mind of our heroine,
the student woman that

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:58.010
at the end of her night is
quite happy with the way

00:51:58.010 --> 00:51:59.380
her observations have gone.

00:52:00.628 --> 00:52:02.044
With the help of
big seer, she has

00:52:02.044 --> 00:52:04.320
looked as far away as
she possibly could.

00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:07.070
And she has gathered a lot
of data about dark matter

00:52:07.070 --> 00:52:11.450
that she hopes to be able
to decrypt and understand

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.550
in order to crack this mystery.

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:15.880
And so this is
how her night ends

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.700
and this is how this talk ends.

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.660
"She sits down.

00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.780
The big blue body of
water in front of her

00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.250
seems to go on without
edges and without end.

00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.600
She can feel the warm hand
of the sun on her face.

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.160
She feels happy.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.770
The night's work has gone well.

00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:37.380
Big seer has done a great job,
the best that could be done.

00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.360
She can go home now.

00:52:39.490 --> 00:52:41.670
But her job has only just begun.

00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:44.290
There is much more left to do
in the coming weeks and months

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:47.310
before she could make sense of
what big seer saw last night.

00:52:48.372 --> 00:52:49.580
She is looking forward to it.

00:52:50.620 --> 00:52:52.130
Letters, and words,
and entire books

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.331
are hidden in what big
seer has given her, written

00:52:54.331 --> 00:52:56.080
in the strange tongue
of the all there is.

00:52:57.034 --> 00:52:58.575
Little by little,
she will understand

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.390
it better and better.

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:02.900
All she needs to do is
ask the right questions

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:06.220
in the right way, and she
might learn the truth.

00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:09.820
She smiles and the sun
smiles back at her."

00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:11.876
So thank you very much
for having me here today.

00:53:11.876 --> 00:53:13.250
It's been a great
pleasure, and I

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:14.791
am very happy to
take your questions.

00:53:14.791 --> 00:53:16.098
Thank you.

00:53:16.098 --> 00:53:20.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.380
AUDIENCE: So I was kind of
surprised to see that matter

00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.480
was one of the thousand words
but things like fog was not.

00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.310
And so I wondered,
maybe there might

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.770
be a case of a
simple homonym where

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:33.860
it's matter as in subject
or something like that.

00:53:33.860 --> 00:53:36.889
So do you think but the
presence of-- I don't know,

00:53:36.889 --> 00:53:38.430
maybe matter is the
only one-- but do

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:41.010
you think that having
a homonym that you're

00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.500
using for a more
abstract concept when

00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.929
in the 1,000-- most likely
it's probably not used

00:53:45.929 --> 00:53:47.720
in that case-- do you
think that that works

00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:52.280
against the general concept
of speaking simply like that?

00:53:53.764 --> 00:53:56.180
ROBERTO TROTTA: Yeah, I think
that's a very good question.

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.710
The [INAUDIBLE] question is,
where does the list of words

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:01.940
come from and which list
should one use, right?

00:54:01.940 --> 00:54:04.704
So I started using
the same list that

00:54:04.704 --> 00:54:06.120
had been used for
the [INAUDIBLE],

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.680
just because it started as an
experimental project very much.

00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:14.180
And then later on when
the book became something

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:17.067
of more substance,
at least to me,

00:54:17.067 --> 00:54:19.150
I started asking myself
those very same questions.

00:54:19.150 --> 00:54:20.540
Where do those words come from?

00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.735
And what happens if I
use a different list?

00:54:22.735 --> 00:54:24.670
And which source
should I use to compile

00:54:24.670 --> 00:54:25.961
these lists is the first place?

00:54:25.961 --> 00:54:27.875
And certainly to
a certain level,

00:54:27.875 --> 00:54:30.500
which kind of source you use to
compile the list will influence

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:33.220
which words make it into the
top 1,000 and which don't.

00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:34.680
And therefore this
might give you

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.300
more abstract or less
abstract words to play with.

00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:39.960
And so to an extent, yes, this
is a relevant question to ask.

00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:45.590
But in the end I came
around view that in a sense

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:48.390
it doesn't really matter
which words are on the list.

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:52.080
Any set of rules is arbitrary
to an extent, and so are mine.

00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:54.620
So I wasn't that much
interested in getting

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:59.840
the absolute top 1,000 most used
words in any specific context.

00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:03.150
What I was interested in was,
given a set of 1,000 words

00:55:03.150 --> 00:55:05.800
and a set of somewhat
arbitrary rules-- for example

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.290
I'm allowing myself to use
names of people but not names

00:55:08.290 --> 00:55:10.660
of cities, just because I
thought that names of people

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:12.960
would be hard to
go around and it

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.494
would be a pointless exercise
of style in doing so.

00:55:15.494 --> 00:55:17.160
But names of cities
could be a fun thing

00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:18.880
to work with if you
don't have them.

00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.320
And so given that
set of rules, it

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:22.070
was interesting seeing
what kind of voice,

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.700
what kind of different
approach to thinking

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.800
about those concepts emerged.

00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:29.340
And so, yes possibly
a different list

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:33.122
would make the exercise
harder or easier perhaps.

00:55:33.122 --> 00:55:34.580
But the point is
that any list will

00:55:34.580 --> 00:55:36.280
have words that are
missing from it.

00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.390
And so the question is,
how do you get around it?

00:55:38.390 --> 00:55:39.890
And what kind of
different approach?

00:55:39.890 --> 00:55:42.670
My hope is that the voice
that emerges from the exercise

00:55:42.670 --> 00:55:45.690
will be novel, and surprising,
and new, and refreshing,

00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:48.700
even if some words
that are missing

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.970
should be there perhaps,
or shouldn't be there.

00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:54.990
My point is just to take a
new approach to this subject

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:57.170
and see whether or not
this can speak to people.

00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:59.630
And what people can
take away from it.

00:55:59.630 --> 00:56:01.302
AUDIENCE: Very
interesting, thank you.

00:56:01.302 --> 00:56:02.760
AUDIENCE: So you
explain why you're

00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:05.185
using the 1,000 words as
opposed to another number.

00:56:05.185 --> 00:56:07.970
But once you've
finished all this,

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:09.920
do you think that maybe
if you had 10,000,

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.870
you would have been able to do
a better job not getting too far

00:56:13.870 --> 00:56:16.750
away from your message
without using words

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:19.030
that people would not
understand necessarily?

00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.946
ROBERTO TROTTA: Right.

00:56:19.946 --> 00:56:23.000
I found actually that 1,000
words was a very interesting

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.640
sweet spot, because
I looked at the list

00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:28.010
and the list goes
up to 2,000 words.

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:30.140
So I don't know
about 10,000 words.

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:32.800
But even if you
go to 2,000 words,

00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:35.800
that list is quite
comprehensive.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.550
In fact, lots of words
that I couldn't use

00:56:37.550 --> 00:56:39.770
are in the 2,000 words.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:43.820
Like energy, for example, and
force is in the top 2,000,

00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:44.680
and so on.

00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.460
And so 2,000 words is
almost too long a list,

00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.850
because it doesn't impose
enough of a straitjacket

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:51.229
on your expression, I think.

00:56:51.229 --> 00:56:52.770
If you make it too
easy for yourself,

00:56:52.770 --> 00:56:57.550
then the experimental side
of the language playfulness

00:56:57.550 --> 00:56:59.506
is lost, in a sense,
because you got almost

00:56:59.506 --> 00:57:01.380
all the words you'd wish
for-- except perhaps

00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:04.850
for redshift or technical
words that you don't want

00:57:04.850 --> 00:57:07.270
to use because they are
jargony and that's fine.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.900
But 2,000 words
would be already too

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.740
big a list to impose any
meaningful restrictions

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:13.690
on your way of
expressing yourself.

00:57:13.690 --> 00:57:16.640
On other hand, 500
words would be too few.

00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:18.800
And you couldn't make
it work, I don't think,

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.590
with 500 because it
becomes too hard.

00:57:21.590 --> 00:57:24.480
And it becomes really cumbersome
to say almost anything

00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.280
with only 500.

00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.410
So 1,000 words is actually
a nice sweet spot.

00:57:28.410 --> 00:57:33.140
And it hard enough,
but not impossible.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.340
And I think if you
tweak it to either side,

00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:39.030
you might find that it becomes
either too easy-- in which case

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:42.180
you fall back to a standard
way of expressing almost

00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:44.490
those concepts-- or
too hard, in which case

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.689
it becomes more of an exercise
in style, which this one is

00:57:47.689 --> 00:57:48.730
only to a certain extent.

00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:50.780
The purpose of this is not
to be an exercise in style.

00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:52.520
It's to really talk
about things in a way

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.450
that people will understand.

00:57:54.450 --> 00:57:56.416
And this is my hope.

00:57:56.416 --> 00:57:59.040
And it's up to my readers to see
whether I've succeeded or not.

00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.790
And that's why I'm also very
keen to hear from people what

00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:03.870
they think, whether it
works for them or not.

00:58:03.870 --> 00:58:06.280
So that's very much an
experiment on my side.

00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.915
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE]
universe expanding.

00:58:08.915 --> 00:58:10.290
The part I wasn't
too clear about

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.500
is whether-- I've
read in some places

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.340
that the medium that
the universe is in

00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:17.640
could actually be expanding in
addition to the galaxies moving

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:20.140
away from one another, which
means that it could move faster

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:22.431
than the speed of light since
whatever it is sitting on

00:58:22.431 --> 00:58:24.690
is actually moving or
stretching at the same time.

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:26.740
Can you explain a
bit more about that?

00:58:26.740 --> 00:58:28.610
ROBERTO TROTTA:
So there's a lots

00:58:28.610 --> 00:58:30.860
of confusion about this
barrier of the speed of light.

00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:35.650
Some people mistakenly think
that-- because as we know,

00:58:35.650 --> 00:58:37.822
the speed of light is the
ultimate speed limit--

00:58:37.822 --> 00:58:40.030
galaxies cannot move away
from each other faster than

00:58:40.030 --> 00:58:40.940
the speed of light.

00:58:40.940 --> 00:58:42.530
That is plain wrong.

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:45.560
Galaxies do move faster
away from each other

00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560
than the speed of light.

00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:47.601
And they do so routinely.

00:58:47.601 --> 00:58:50.040
In fact, there is a large
number of the galaxies

00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:52.810
that we saw on that slide
that are moving away

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.547
from us at faster than the speed
of light and always have been.

00:58:55.547 --> 00:58:57.880
Now that's a tricky bit,
because we think, well actually

00:58:57.880 --> 00:58:59.320
if those galaxies are
moving away faster

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.330
than the speed of light, how
is it that we can see them?

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.730
How is it that light can catch
up with us in the first place?

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:05.650
So that's something that's
slightly counter intuitive

00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:07.800
about it, and it cannot
be explained except with

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.350
generativity.

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:12.441
So analogies such as if you
go downstream and the stream

00:59:12.441 --> 00:59:16.310
is faster, then you can
swim upward, upstream, you

00:59:16.310 --> 00:59:19.340
will never catch up [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:21.600
And those analogies do
not work in cosmology

00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.190
because of generativity.

00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:25.640
So galaxies do move away
faster than the speed of light.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.970
But the point is
that it's not them

00:59:27.970 --> 00:59:29.994
moving in space faster
than the speed of light.

00:59:29.994 --> 00:59:31.410
It's the space
between them that's

00:59:31.410 --> 00:59:33.520
expanding faster than
the speed of light.

00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.740
So that doesn't break the
speed of light barrier,

00:59:35.740 --> 00:59:37.156
because the speed
of light barrier

00:59:37.156 --> 00:59:39.770
is for objects inside
space time to have

00:59:39.770 --> 00:59:42.490
so-called peculiar velocities--
that's to say velocities

00:59:42.490 --> 00:59:45.412
inside space time moving
from one place to another.

00:59:45.412 --> 00:59:46.870
But because it's
space time itself,

00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:50.490
the pizza dough if you like
in the analogy is expanding.

00:59:50.490 --> 00:59:53.960
The recession speed,
the speed at which

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:57.640
are bolted onto space time are
moving away from each other

00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:00.220
can be faster than
the speed of light.

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:04.180
And so that is a misconception
the things cannot move farther

01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:05.500
away than the speed of light.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.402
They do, and we observe
them all the time.

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:08.110
AUDIENCE: I know.

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.590
Every time I see
the WMAP picture,

01:00:10.590 --> 01:00:13.574
I'm trying to understand,
why does it have its shape?

01:00:13.574 --> 01:00:14.990
And what does it
really represent?

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:17.480
Does it represent anything
that's moving away from us?

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.710
And obviously,
things coming with us

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:22.660
we'd be able to see the
one closer to us as opposed

01:00:22.660 --> 01:00:24.760
to seeing it how it was
13 billion years ago.

01:00:24.984 --> 01:00:27.400
ROBERTO TROTTA: You mean the
microwave background picture?

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:00:28.450 --> 01:00:29.510
ROBERTO TROTTA: So the
microwave background

01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:31.410
picture-- this picture
here-- is actually

01:00:31.410 --> 01:00:34.330
a-- think of this as a
picture taken on a screen.

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:37.180
So this picture here
is-- all the light

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:40.170
that comes from this picture
has been emitted 380,000

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:42.860
years after the Big Bang, and
it has been traveling ever

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:45.190
since through the universe.

01:00:45.190 --> 01:00:48.660
So this is like a
snapshot-- literally it's

01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:51.900
a snapshot of what the universe
looked like at that time.

01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:54.680
So by shape, do you mean the
shape of the picture itself

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.535
or the shape of
the blobs inside.

01:00:56.535 --> 01:00:58.160
AUDIENCE: No, the
shape of the picture.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.830
And the thing is, for us to see
13 billion years in the past,

01:01:02.830 --> 01:01:05.260
we have to be 13 billion
light years away from it?

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:05.760
Or not?

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.630
ROBERTO TROTTA: That's
right, absolutely.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.580
Yeah, even more, I
mean, because of course

01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:10.490
13 billion light years
is a ton of time.

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:13.293
But in the meantime,
in this time,

01:01:13.293 --> 01:01:16.480
the part of space from
which this light has left

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:17.620
has been expanded away.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:19.120
So the current
distance to this part

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.956
is much more, about 45
billion light years, in fact.

01:01:21.956 --> 01:01:24.330
AUDIENCE: Is all of that stuff
that's moving away from us

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:25.320
today?

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:27.279
Or some of it actually
is moving our direction?

01:01:27.279 --> 01:01:29.486
ROBERTO TROTTA: No, all of
this would be moving away,

01:01:29.486 --> 01:01:31.760
because it's so far away
that it will be moving away.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.468
AUDIENCE: That's why
we're seeing it now.

01:01:33.468 --> 01:01:36.190
Otherwise we wouldn't be
seeing it that far in the past.

01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:40.704
ROBERTO TROTTA: Well, you
would see the things now,

01:01:40.704 --> 01:01:43.120
after the light travel time
independent of whether they're

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.220
moving away or
moving towards us,

01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:49.400
just because of the initial
distance between them and us.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.570
And then the light beam
leaves, and then it

01:01:51.570 --> 01:01:52.740
travels through space time.

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:56.185
And whatever the initial source
is doing is then independent.

01:01:56.185 --> 01:01:58.060
So it's just the time
that it takes for light

01:01:58.060 --> 01:02:00.020
to travel across the space time.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:04.340
And so that's how the
connection between us

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.740
and this distant
part of space is

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.400
purely given by the
light travel time

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:11.040
that it takes for a beam of
light to go from there to now.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:12.760
AUDIENCE: Oh, so something
that could emit light

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.160
back then-- because
you just said

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.826
can move faster than
the speed of light,

01:02:15.826 --> 01:02:17.130
because of the medium.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:18.338
ROBERTO TROTTA: That's right.

01:02:18.910 --> 01:02:21.224
It would be recessed
away from us faster

01:02:21.224 --> 01:02:22.890
than the speed of
light in the meantime.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:26.530
But the light all the while
is catching up with us.

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:28.531
So we will see the
picture of that

01:02:28.531 --> 01:02:30.030
object as it goes
at the moment when

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:31.950
the light had been emitted.

01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.370
AUDIENCE: And the reason
for that actual shape.

01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:35.204
Why does the shape--

01:02:35.204 --> 01:02:36.953
ROBERTO TROTTA: OK,
shape is just the fact

01:02:36.953 --> 01:02:39.180
that we're looking at the
entire sky, all around us.

01:02:39.180 --> 01:02:40.940
And so sometimes
we see the shape

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.660
in the shape of a
balloon, which would

01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:44.670
be the shape of the
sky like when you have

01:02:44.670 --> 01:02:48.440
a normal constellation
type of balloon

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:50.300
with all the constellations
painted on it.

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:52.050
And then what you do,
you cut this balloon

01:02:52.050 --> 01:02:54.350
across one of the great
circles, and lie down flat,

01:02:54.350 --> 01:02:55.610
and this is what you see.

01:02:55.610 --> 01:02:58.080
This is just a picture
of the entire 360 degrees

01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:01.410
sphere of the sky around us cut
along one of the [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.590
lie down flat on paper.

01:03:02.590 --> 01:03:04.840
AUDIENCE: So where would the
earth be on that picture?

01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:06.090
ROBERTO TROTTA: At the center.

01:03:06.090 --> 01:03:06.940
At the center.

01:03:06.940 --> 01:03:08.290
It's wrapped around us.

01:03:08.290 --> 01:03:09.270
AUDIENCE: That's how
it's put on picture.

01:03:09.270 --> 01:03:09.769
OK.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.480
SPEAKER 1: thank Roberto again.

01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.090
ROBERTO TROTTA:
Thank you. [APPLAUSE]
