00:00:01.103 --> 00:00:03.464
- [Instructor] Anush is
playing a carnival game

00:00:03.464 --> 00:00:06.453
that involves two free throws.

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:10.683
The table below displays the
probability distribution of X,

00:00:10.683 --> 00:00:14.667
the number of shots that
Anush makes in a set of two

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:18.244
attempts, along with
some summary statistics.

00:00:18.244 --> 00:00:20.328
So here's the random variable X

00:00:20.328 --> 00:00:22.188
it's a discrete random variable.

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.303
It only takes on a finite number of value,

00:00:24.303 --> 00:00:26.438
sometimes you can say
it takes on a countable

00:00:26.438 --> 00:00:27.324
number of values.

00:00:27.324 --> 00:00:29.592
We see we can either
make zero free throws,

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:31.509
one, or two of the two.

00:00:32.347 --> 00:00:35.159
And the probability that
he makes zero is here,

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:36.812
one is here, two is here.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.288
And then they also give us the mean of X

00:00:39.288 --> 00:00:41.940
and the standard deviation of X.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.299
Then they tell us if the
game costs Anush $15 to play

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:49.309
and he wins $10 per shot he makes,

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.476
what are the mean and standard
deviation of his net gain

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:57.310
from playing the game N?

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.941
All right, so let's define
a new random variable N.

00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:03.524
Which is equal to his net gain.

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:05.896
Net gain.

00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:09.513
We can define N in terms of X.

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:13.508
What is his net gain going to be?

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:17.014
Well let's see, N, it's
going to be equal to 10 times

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.110
however many shots he makes.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.443
So it's gonna be 10 times X.

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.450
And then no matter what,
he has to pay $15 to play.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.283
Minus 15.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.431
In fact, we can set up a little table here

00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:33.228
for the probability distribution of N.

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:35.610
So, let me make it right over here.

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.472
So I'll make it look just like this one.

00:01:37.472 --> 00:01:39.389
N is equal to net gain.

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:44.496
And here we'll have the probability of N.

00:01:44.496 --> 00:01:45.893
And there's three outcomes here.

00:01:45.893 --> 00:01:49.042
The outcome that corresponds
to him making zero shots,

00:01:49.042 --> 00:01:51.291
well that would be 10 times zero minus 15.

00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:53.717
That would be a net gain of negative 15.

00:01:53.717 --> 00:01:57.217
And would have the same probability, 0.16.

00:01:58.387 --> 00:02:01.282
When he makes one shot,
the net gain is gonna be

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:02.900
10 times one minus 15

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.615
which is, negative five.

00:02:04.615 --> 00:02:06.784
Which is going to have
the same probability.

00:02:06.784 --> 00:02:09.024
He has a 48% chance of making one shot.

00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:13.612
And so it's a 48% chance
of losing five dollars.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.547
And then last, but not least,

00:02:15.547 --> 00:02:19.606
when X is two his net gain
is gonna be positive five.

00:02:19.606 --> 00:02:21.034
Plus five.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:23.451
And so this is a 0.36 chance.

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:28.330
So what they want us to figure out are,

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.405
what are the mean

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:31.367
and standard deviation of his net gain?

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:34.058
So let's first figure out the mean

00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:34.891
of N.

00:02:36.357 --> 00:02:39.511
Well, if you scale a random variable

00:02:39.511 --> 00:02:41.583
the corresponding mean is going to be

00:02:41.583 --> 00:02:43.160
scaled by the same amount.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.062
And if you shift a random variable

00:02:45.062 --> 00:02:47.362
the corresponding mean is gonna be

00:02:47.362 --> 00:02:49.544
shifted by the same amount.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.061
So the mean of N is gonna be 10 times

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:53.928
the mean of X

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:54.761
minus 15.

00:02:56.064 --> 00:03:00.170
Which is equal to 10 times 1.2 minus 15.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:01.467
1.2.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:05.423
So there's 12 minus 15 which is equal to

00:03:05.423 --> 00:03:06.868
negative three.

00:03:06.868 --> 00:03:09.029
Now the standard deviation of N

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:10.469
is gonna be slightly different.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.564
For the standard
deviation, scaling matters.

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:16.556
If you scale a random
variable by a certain value

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:19.049
you would also scale
the standard deviation

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.239
by the same value.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.078
So this is going to be equal to 10

00:03:22.078 --> 00:03:24.911
times the standard deviation of X.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.781
Now you might say, what
about the shift over here?

00:03:27.781 --> 00:03:31.244
Well, the shift should
not affect the spread

00:03:31.244 --> 00:03:32.849
of the random variable.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.907
If you're scaling the
random variable, well,

00:03:34.907 --> 00:03:36.757
your spread should grow by the amount

00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:37.924
that you're scaling it.

00:03:37.924 --> 00:03:39.830
But by shifting it, it doesn't affect

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.426
how much you disperse from the mean.

00:03:42.426 --> 00:03:46.308
So standard deviation is
only affected by the scaling,

00:03:46.308 --> 00:03:48.627
but not by the shifting.

00:03:48.627 --> 00:03:51.065
So this is going to be 10 times

00:03:51.065 --> 00:03:51.898
0.69

00:03:52.842 --> 00:03:54.108
which is going to.

00:03:54.108 --> 00:03:55.344
This was an approximation.

00:03:55.344 --> 00:03:57.222
So I'll say this is approximately

00:03:57.222 --> 00:03:58.055
to 6.9.

00:04:00.705 --> 00:04:04.676
So this is our new
distribution for our net gain.

00:04:04.676 --> 00:04:06.299
This is the mean of our net gain.

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.773
And this is roughly the standard
deviation of our net gain.
