00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.986
We can represent the cost
of four coffees and

00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:08.558
two teas as c + c + c + c + t + t.

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:13.474
We can also represent it as 4c + 2t,

00:00:13.474 --> 00:00:19.783
which is the same thing
as 4 times c + 2 times t.

00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:23.644
This is the shortest way to represent
the cost of 4 coffees and 2 teas, and

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:26.670
usually the shortest way to
express something is better.
