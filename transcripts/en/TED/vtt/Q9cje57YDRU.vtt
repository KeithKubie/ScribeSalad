00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:17.000
I want to start out
with quoting Helen Keller,

00:00:18.583 --> 00:00:21.643
that great woman that we all admire.

00:00:21.667 --> 00:00:25.250
And she had a statement
that is very profound,

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:28.393
and this statement is

00:00:28.417 --> 00:00:34.476
that science has been able to find
cures for many evils,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.476
but never the greatest evil
of all in human beings,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.208
and that evil is apathy.

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:48.268
So, we know that apathy
really costs us a lot,

00:00:48.292 --> 00:00:50.726
especially in our democracy.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.184
And when we think of why
people do not get involved,

00:00:54.208 --> 00:00:56.476
why they do not become activists,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.184
it's often that people are so worn down
with their own familial responsibilities,

00:01:02.208 --> 00:01:04.476
and women especially.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.059
You know, women,
they have so many inhibitions.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:11.476
Many of them have suffered
so much trauma in their lives,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.726
so many aggressions in their lives.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.809
And so it's very hard for them to realize
that they have leadership capacities.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:21.792
That they can get out there,
and they could change the world.

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.601
Another thing that many women --

00:01:24.625 --> 00:01:26.893
we think that we have to do everything.

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:30.476
That we are the only ones
responsible for our families,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.893
and it is so hard for us to delegate

00:01:33.917 --> 00:01:38.268
and just get others to help us
do the duties that we are responsible for.

00:01:38.292 --> 00:01:40.809
We feel embarrassed or we feel guilty.

00:01:40.833 --> 00:01:43.351
But we know that we have
to make this happen,

00:01:43.375 --> 00:01:47.809
because if not, we will never have time
to be able to volunteer

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:51.833
to help on these many causes
that are now facing us.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:56.184
One of the areas that women
can give up a little bit of time

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:58.184
and that is in shopping, OK?

00:01:58.208 --> 00:02:00.726
(Laughter)

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.434
And especially when we go out there

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:04.559
shopping for things
that we don't even need.

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.601
(Laughter)

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:09.351
You know, you never saw
a hearse with a U-Haul behind it.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:12.393
(Laughter)

00:02:12.417 --> 00:02:16.018
We have to live simply,
so that others can simply live.

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:18.351
And when we think
of the kind of inheritance

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:21.726
that we want to leave to our children
or our grandchildren,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.809
think of leaving them a legacy of justice.

00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:27.476
This is a legacy
that they can not only imitate,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.643
but they can be proud of
for the rest of their lives.

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:34.643
If we leave them a lot of material goods,
all they're going to do is fight,

00:02:34.667 --> 00:02:36.476
and they're going to hate each other.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.559
Just remember that,
when we think about what we're doing.

00:02:39.583 --> 00:02:44.184
The other thing that we have to do
to liberate our women, eventually,

00:02:44.208 --> 00:02:47.518
so that we can do the kind
of volunteer work that we need to do

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:49.059
to change this world,

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:53.559
is we have to have a different kind
of an education for our young women.

00:02:53.583 --> 00:02:57.059
Unfortunately, in our societies
around the world,

00:02:57.083 --> 00:02:59.375
women are taught to be victims.

00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:04.018
Women are not taught that they
are going to have to defend themselves,

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:06.351
that they're going to have
to support themselves

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:08.268
and they have to protect themselves.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.245
Because, you know, when we
actually look at the animal kingdom,

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.643
and we see who are the most ferocious,
the male or the female?

00:03:15.667 --> 00:03:17.601
We know it's the female, right?

00:03:17.625 --> 00:03:22.226
So something went wrong with us at the top
of that animal kingdom as women.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.893
(Laughter)

00:03:23.917 --> 00:03:27.268
So I want to give you an example
of how I found my voice.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:30.851
And I was very fortunate in that,
when I was 25 years old,

00:03:30.875 --> 00:03:33.268
I met a gentleman named Fred Ross Sr.,

00:03:33.292 --> 00:03:38.143
who organized a chapter of a group called
the Community Service Organization

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:41.018
in my hometown of Stockton, California.

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:45.292
This was a grassroots organization,
and I was recruited to be a volunteer.

00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:49.434
So, one day, while we were
sitting in the office,

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.476
a farm worker comes in.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.518
And he's paralyzed,
he can hardly walk, he has a crutch.

00:03:55.542 --> 00:03:56.851
And he needs help.

00:03:56.875 --> 00:03:59.601
He needs someone to help him
go down to the welfare office

00:03:59.625 --> 00:04:00.934
and make an application.

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:03.143
So, I volunteered to do that.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:05.684
But when I got to the welfare office,

00:04:05.708 --> 00:04:10.143
they would not let me make
an application for this gentleman.

00:04:10.167 --> 00:04:13.018
So I didn't know what to do,
I was at a loss.

00:04:13.042 --> 00:04:15.851
So I went back to the office,
and I told Mr. Ross,

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:18.393
"They won't let me make an application."

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:20.934
And he said to me, very sternly,

00:04:20.958 --> 00:04:24.476
"You go right back down
to that welfare office,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.875
and you demand to see a supervisor.

00:04:27.875 --> 00:04:30.916
And you demand that they
let him make an application."

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.976
And I thought, "Wow, I can do that?"

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.059
(Laughter)

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:36.351
So I thought about it,

00:04:36.375 --> 00:04:39.351
and I kind of overcame
my anxieties and my fears.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:43.184
I went down to the welfare office
and I demanded to see the supervisor.

00:04:43.208 --> 00:04:45.434
Sure enough, he came out,

00:04:45.458 --> 00:04:48.809
and they had to let Mr. Ruiz
make an application for welfare.

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:52.309
And he got his disability
for himself and his family.

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.018
But that taught me a lesson.

00:04:54.042 --> 00:04:56.601
That taught me that I had a voice.

00:04:56.625 --> 00:05:00.934
Well, Mr. Ross also taught many of us
many other things, including Cesar Chavez

00:05:00.958 --> 00:05:02.809
and many other volunteers.

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:06.351
And he taught us not only
that we can make demands of people,

00:05:06.375 --> 00:05:08.934
especially our public officials.

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.393
And this is something
we should always keep in mind:

00:05:11.417 --> 00:05:15.559
every public official --
guess what -- they work for us.

00:05:15.583 --> 00:05:18.726
Because we pay their salaries
with out taxes.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.976
And they are actually our servants.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.726
Some of them turn out to be leaders,
but not all of them.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.809
(Laughter)

00:05:25.833 --> 00:05:28.768
Once in a while we get
a leader out of there.

00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:33.726
The other thing that Mr. Ross taught us
is that voting is extremely important.

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:35.309
And not just voting,

00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:38.684
but going out there
and getting other people to vote.

00:05:38.708 --> 00:05:39.958
Going door to door.

00:05:40.792 --> 00:05:42.893
Phone banking, talking to voters,

00:05:42.917 --> 00:05:46.434
because many voters have a lot of doubts
and they don't know how to vote.

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:47.726
And unfortunately,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.809
we know that in many countries
people are not allowed to vote

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.601
because we have voter suppression
in other countries,

00:05:53.625 --> 00:05:55.893
like we do here
in the United States of America.

00:05:55.917 --> 00:05:58.559
But the thing is, if we can
get out there as individuals

00:05:58.583 --> 00:06:02.101
and talk to people,
so we can remove their apathy

00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:04.393
and make sure that they can vote.

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:08.559
So, I want to give you an example
of a woman in our foundation,

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:10.184
the Dolores Huerta Foundation,

00:06:10.208 --> 00:06:13.851
and just to show you
that sometimes people have power,

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:15.143
but they don't know it.

00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:18.101
But once they find it,
they do miraculous things.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:22.309
So, Leticia Prado
is an immigrant from Mexico,

00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:24.476
only has a sixth-grade education

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.184
and speaks very limited English.

00:06:27.208 --> 00:06:29.101
But she was very concerned

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:34.476
because the children at the middle school
in their town called Weedpatch --

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.559
this is in California, Central Valley --

00:06:36.583 --> 00:06:39.851
they couldn't go out
and play in the schoolyard,

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:42.476
because the air quality is so bad

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.059
in the southern part
of Kern County, California

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:47.101
in our United States of America.

00:06:47.125 --> 00:06:51.893
So she and her husband went out there,
and they passed a bond issue

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:55.309
to build a brand new,
state-of-the-art gymnasium

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.417
for the kids at their middle school.

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.476
That was a big success.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.101
Then she heard a rumor

00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:05.518
that the principal was going to end
the breakfast program

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:07.018
for the farm worker children,

00:07:07.042 --> 00:07:10.768
because the principal thought
it was just too much paperwork.

00:07:10.792 --> 00:07:14.143
So, Leticia got herself elected
to the school board.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:17.851
And they kept the breakfast program,
and she got rid of the principal.

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.143
(Laughter)

00:07:20.167 --> 00:07:24.809
(Applause)

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:26.309
So there were other rumors

00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:29.768
about some corruption
in the local water district.

00:07:29.792 --> 00:07:32.518
So, Leticia got herself elected
to the water district.

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:35.476
Then she looked into all of the finances
of the water district

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:40.976
and found there was 250,000 dollars
missing from their bank account.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.601
So, Leticia called in the grand jury,
and several arrests have been made.

00:07:45.625 --> 00:07:50.893
And this is just an example
of a woman who never went to high school,

00:07:50.917 --> 00:07:52.184
never went to college,

00:07:52.208 --> 00:07:53.643
but she found her power.

00:07:53.667 --> 00:07:57.143
And in addition, she has recruited
other people in the community

00:07:57.167 --> 00:07:59.143
to also run for public office,

00:07:59.167 --> 00:08:01.809
and guess what -- they've all
gotten themselves elected.

00:08:01.833 --> 00:08:07.059
So, I take that Leticia really embodies

00:08:07.083 --> 00:08:09.726
something that Coretta Scott King said.

00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.726
And I want to share this with you.
Coretta Scott King said,

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.417
"We will never have peace in the world
until women take power."

00:08:17.708 --> 00:08:23.768
(Applause)

00:08:23.792 --> 00:08:26.309
Now, I have amended that statement to say

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:31.309
that we will never have peace in the world
until feminists take power.

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:32.393
(Laughter)

00:08:32.417 --> 00:08:34.893
Because we know
there is a difference, right?

00:08:34.917 --> 00:08:38.809
Not only that, but if we want
to define what is a feminist --

00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:41.643
a person who stands up
for reproductive rights,

00:08:41.667 --> 00:08:44.601
for immigrants' rights,
for the environment,

00:08:44.625 --> 00:08:49.601
for LGBT rights and also
for labor unions and working people.

00:08:49.625 --> 00:08:54.808
(Applause)

00:08:54.832 --> 00:08:58.851
Which also means
that men can also be feminists.

00:08:58.875 --> 00:09:04.518
(Applause)

00:09:04.542 --> 00:09:06.851
So when we think of feminization,

00:09:06.875 --> 00:09:10.351
we should also think
of how can we feminize the policies,

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:12.726
and not only of our major countries,

00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:14.851
the wealthy countries
like the United States,

00:09:14.875 --> 00:09:16.184
but all over the world,

00:09:16.208 --> 00:09:18.434
our domestic and foreign policy.

00:09:18.458 --> 00:09:22.268
And one of the things that we can do
to stop wars and to have peace

00:09:22.292 --> 00:09:25.226
is to make sure that the wealthiest
countries in the world

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.184
also help the developing countries.

00:09:27.208 --> 00:09:28.851
Now, we did this in the past.

00:09:28.875 --> 00:09:30.393
After World War II,

00:09:30.417 --> 00:09:33.601
when Japan and Germany
were devastated after the war,

00:09:33.625 --> 00:09:39.018
United States of America gave
many tax dollars to those two countries,

00:09:39.042 --> 00:09:43.518
so that they can rebuild their economies
and rebuild their corporations.

00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:45.208
And we can do that again.

00:09:46.083 --> 00:09:49.101
And if we can think about how
we can help these other countries.

00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:50.559
And I want to give an example

00:09:50.583 --> 00:09:53.476
of issues that we are facing
in the United States of America,

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.768
for instance.

00:09:54.792 --> 00:09:56.101
We know that right now

00:09:56.125 --> 00:09:58.768
we have a lot of refugees
from Central America

00:09:58.792 --> 00:10:01.143
that are at the border
of the United States.

00:10:01.167 --> 00:10:03.684
Why do people leave their homes,

00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:06.143
their beautiful homes
that we go to as tourists?

00:10:06.167 --> 00:10:08.351
Because they don't have
opportunities there.

00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:11.559
And then we think, "Hm, bananas."

00:10:11.583 --> 00:10:15.851
How many jillions of bananas do we consume
in the United States every single day?

00:10:15.875 --> 00:10:17.643
And throughout the world.

00:10:17.667 --> 00:10:19.768
Now, do the people in Central America

00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:23.018
get the profits from the bananas
that we consume?

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:24.434
No, they don't.

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:29.226
The profits go to corporations
from the United States of America.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.059
And we think that this is wrong.

00:10:31.083 --> 00:10:36.184
Now, if the people in Central America
were to be able to get some of that money

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:37.851
that we pay for bananas,

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:39.976
then they wouldn't have
to leave their homes.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.601
They wouldn't have to come
as asylum seekers

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:44.869
to the borders of the United
States of America.

00:10:44.893 --> 00:10:50.434
And then maybe, many children would not
have to be separated from their parents.

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:53.184
Now, we know that there are
countries in the world

00:10:53.208 --> 00:10:57.059
that actually have free education
and have free health care

00:10:57.083 --> 00:10:59.393
for all of the people in their country.

00:10:59.417 --> 00:11:01.351
And that country is Cuba.

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:04.059
Cuba has health care
for every one of their citizens,

00:11:04.083 --> 00:11:08.143
and they have a free college education
for every one of their citizens.

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.018
They're 11 million citizens.

00:11:10.042 --> 00:11:13.184
Now, we think, if a poor country like Cuba

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:17.351
can have these kind of resources,
and we know that they're a poor country,

00:11:17.375 --> 00:11:19.934
then why can't some
of the other wealthier countries,

00:11:19.958 --> 00:11:21.601
like the United States of America,

00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:22.893
do the same?

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:24.726
I think that we can make that happen.

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.143
(Applause)

00:11:28.167 --> 00:11:29.934
But we know it's not going to happen

00:11:29.958 --> 00:11:33.768
until we, the people
of the United States of America,

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:35.351
and people throughout the world,

00:11:35.375 --> 00:11:40.226
start making sure that they get public
officials elected to their governments

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:44.143
that really care about the constituents,
they care about people,

00:11:44.167 --> 00:11:47.393
they will commit to make sure
that the resources that they have

00:11:47.417 --> 00:11:51.518
are going to be used for their citizens,
and not to be used for war.

00:11:51.542 --> 00:11:53.934
So, how do we make this happen?

00:11:53.958 --> 00:11:55.643
We have to get rid of the apathy,

00:11:55.667 --> 00:11:57.601
we have to get more people involved.

00:11:57.625 --> 00:12:01.518
We know that if we can't have
a democracy in the United States,

00:12:01.542 --> 00:12:03.768
we can't have democracies
throughout the world,

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:05.351
unless people participate.

00:12:05.375 --> 00:12:09.893
So it is imperative that all of us
get out there and we say,

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:13.101
"Get rid of the apathy,
get off of the sidewalk,

00:12:13.125 --> 00:12:15.518
come and join the march
for peace and justice,

00:12:15.542 --> 00:12:18.393
let's make Coretta Scott's
vision a reality,

00:12:18.417 --> 00:12:20.018
to have peace in the world."

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:23.518
We recently had midterm elections
in the United States of America.

00:12:23.542 --> 00:12:25.143
And what did we see?

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:27.726
We saw that so many more women,

00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:30.851
young people, people of color, LGBT folks,

00:12:30.875 --> 00:12:32.809
were all elected to public office.

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:34.768
And we know this happened -- why?

00:12:34.792 --> 00:12:37.684
Because so many women were on the march.

00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:40.309
We had the Women's March
in the United States.

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:42.684
They had the Women's Marches
all over the world.

00:12:42.708 --> 00:12:46.309
And so we now see
that we have this potential.

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:48.643
We have this potential
to get rid of the apathy.

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:52.351
And if we get everyone involved,
get everyone committed,

00:12:52.375 --> 00:12:56.101
then, I think, we can make
Coretta Scott's vision come true.

00:12:56.125 --> 00:12:58.768
So, I want to just remind everybody,

00:12:58.792 --> 00:13:01.601
throughout the world,
one of the things is,

00:13:01.625 --> 00:13:03.393
we have power,

00:13:03.417 --> 00:13:05.059
poor people have power,

00:13:05.083 --> 00:13:06.809
every citizen has power.

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:11.934
But in order to achieve
the peace that we all yearn for,

00:13:11.958 --> 00:13:13.726
then we've all got to get involved.

00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:15.768
So, what do we say?

00:13:15.792 --> 00:13:17.059
Can we do it?

00:13:17.083 --> 00:13:18.393
We say, "Yes, we can!"

00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:20.559
And in Spanish, we say, "Sí, se puede."

00:13:20.583 --> 00:13:21.893
Thank you very much.

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:26.625
(Applause)
