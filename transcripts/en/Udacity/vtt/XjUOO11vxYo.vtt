00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
I won't bore you with the arithmetic again.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
It's the same as it was the last two times,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and we wind up with the same answers we had the first time.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:20.000
B is equal to 4.5, and r is equal to 0.982.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What I hope you've noticed is that r doesn't change when we scale x or y.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
B doesn't change as long as we scale x and y by the same amount.
