00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.050
Write 14,897 in expanded form.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:08.165
Let me just rewrite the number,
and I'll color code

00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:10.650
it, and that way, we can keep
track of our digits.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.470
So we have 14,000.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.430
I don't have to write
it-- well, let me

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.410
write it that big.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:31.150
14,000, 800, and 97-- I already
used the blue; maybe I

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.990
should use yellow--
in expanded form.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.070
So let's think about
what place each of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.480
these digits are in.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.160
This right here, the 7,
is in the ones place.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.450
The 9 is in the tens place.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.556
This literally represents 9
tens, and we're going to see

00:00:55.556 --> 00:00:56.080
this in a second.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.250
This literally represents
7 ones.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.500
The 8 is in the hundreds
place.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.500
The 4 is in the thousands
place.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.170
It literally represents 4,000.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.800
And then the 1 is in the
ten-thousands place.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.210
And you see, every time you move
to the left, you move one

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.540
place to the left, you're
multiplying by 10.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.260
Ones place, tens place, hundreds
place, thousands

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.500
place, ten-thousands place.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.570
Now let's think about what
that really means.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.940
If this 1 is in the
ten-thousands place, that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.790
means that it literally
represents-- I want to do this

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.520
in a way that my arrows
don't get mixed up.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.020
Actually, let me start
at the other end.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.970
Let me start with what
the 7 represents.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.820
The 7 literally represents
7 ones.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.510
Or another way to think about
it, you could say it

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.920
represents 7 times 1.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.000
All of these are equivalent.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.150
They represent 7 ones.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:02.640
Now let's think about the 9.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.450
That's why I'm doing it from the
right, so that the arrows

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.220
don't have to cross
each other.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.385
So what does the 9 represent?

00:02:07.385 --> 00:02:10.720
It represents 9 tens.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.530
You could literally imagine
you have 9 actual tens.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.270
You could have a 10, plus
a 10, plus a 10.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.820
Do that nine times.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.300
That's literally what it
represents: 9 actual tens.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.720
9 tens, or you could say it's
the same thing as 9 times 10,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.280
or 90, either way you want
to think about it.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.060
So let me write all
the different ways

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.620
to think about it.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.330
It represents all of these
things: 9 tens, or 9

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.100
times 10, or 90.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.430
So then we have our 8.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.250
Our 8 represents-- we see it's
in the hundreds place.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.570
It represents 8 hundreds.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.210
Or you could view that as being
equivalent to 8 times

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.570
100-- a hundred, not
a thousand-- 8

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.140
times 100, or 800.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.130
That 8 literally represents
8 hundreds, 800.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.540
And then the 4.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.350
I think you get the idea here.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.110
This represents the
thousands place.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.270
It represents 4 thousands, which
is the same thing as 4

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.950
times 1,000, which is the
same thing as 4,000.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.350
4,000 is the same thing
as 4 thousands.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:23.420
Add it up.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.520
And then finally, we have this
1, which is sitting in the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.730
ten-thousands place, so it
literally represents 1

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.980
ten-thousand.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.010
You can imagine if these were
chips, kind of poker chips,

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.700
that would represent one of the
blue poker chips and each

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700
blue poker chip represents
10,000.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.000
I don't know if that
helps you or not.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.330
And 1 ten-thousand is the same
thing as 1 times 10,000 which

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.020
is the same thing as 10,000.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.020
So when they ask us to write it
in expanded form, we could

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:03.020
write 14,897 literally as the
sum of these numbers, of its

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.270
components, or we could
write it as the

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:05.820
sum of these numbers.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.740
Actually, let me write this.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.340
This top 7 times 1 is
just equal to 7.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:29.710
So 14,897 is the same thing as
10,000 plus 4,000 plus 800

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:39.220
plus 90 plus 7.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.620
So you could consider this
expanded form, or you could

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.330
use this version of it, or you
could say this the same thing

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.860
as 1 times 10,000, depending on
what people consider to be

00:04:48.860 --> 00:05:02.860
expanded form-- plus 4 times
1,000 plus 8 times 100 plus 9

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:09.160
times 10 plus 7 times 1.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:10.930
I'll scroll to the right
a little bit.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.910
So either of these could be
considered expanded form.
