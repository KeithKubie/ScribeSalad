JEFF CARLONI: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.398
Thanks for coming
to our discussion

00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:07.630
about rethinking
your waste today.

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:09.900
I hope you find it
informative and fun.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:10.900
My name is Jeff Carloni.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.191
I'm a resource and materials
management consultant here

00:00:13.191 --> 00:00:16.770
at Google with a goal of helping
Google achieve a zero waste

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.270
future.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.890
That's my role here.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.060
I'm honored to be joined
by our three panelists here

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.140
who have come to talk about
their personal journeys

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.350
to reducing waste
in their lives.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.160
My hope is that from
the discussion today,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.993
you can all take away
one or two things that

00:00:30.993 --> 00:00:35.880
can help you to reduce your
waste in your own world,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.436
and we'll discuss some
impacts that waste

00:00:38.436 --> 00:00:40.060
has on human health
and the environment

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.987
and topics like that.

00:00:41.987 --> 00:00:43.820
The format today is
meant to be interactive,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.444
so I'm going to kind
of open up and ask

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.750
you each a few questions.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.890
And then once they get
bored of me talking,

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.730
I'll ask you guys to ask some
questions if you have any,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.170
so we'll go with that.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.920
So with that, I'll go ahead
and introduce our panelists.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.960
To my right, we have
Michael O'Heaney.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.020
He's the executive director of
Story of Stuff Has anyone seen

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.340
the videos on "Story of Stuff?"

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.190
OK, cool.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.500
Yeah, so he's behind the
scenes running those things.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.290
To plagiarize from your website,
"We have a problem with stuff.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.990
We use too much, too
much of it is toxic,

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.257
and we don't share it
very well, but that's not

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:16.340
the way things have to be.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.840
Together we can build a society
based on better, not more;

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.280
sharing, not selfishness;
and community, not division.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.890
The Story of Stuff
Project's journey

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.270
began with a 20-minute online
movie called "Story of Stuff"

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.470
about the way we make,
use, and throw away

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.030
all the stuff in our lives.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.120
So that was five years
ago and 40 million

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.081
views they've had now
on all their videos.

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:38.830
They're a community
of more than a million

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.960
change-makers worldwide,
of which I am one.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.270
I signed up.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.240
And they're working to
build a healthy community

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.670
and a just planet.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.630
So Michael brings over
15 years of experience

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.110
as an advocate
fundraiser and consultant

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.650
in his role as
executive director.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.220
Prior to joining
Story of Stuff, he

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.370
developed fundraising and
communication strategies

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.100
for environmental, civil
rights, and reproductive justice

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.720
and media reform organizations
as a principal of Channing Way

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.870
Consulting.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.050
He also served as a
development director

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.230
for two San Francisco
Bay Area advocacy

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.140
organizations, Global Exchange
and Pacific Environment.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.930
Welcome, Michael.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.096
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: Thank you.

00:02:19.096 --> 00:02:20.100
Thank you.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.240
JEFF CARLONI: To his
right, we have Bea Johnson,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.160
who some of you saw give an
authors talk at Google just

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.000
an hour ago in this very room.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.675
Bea lives a waste-free life
with her family since 2008.

00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:33.990
This jar here actually
represents her entire waste

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.247
for her whole family for 2014.

00:02:37.247 --> 00:02:38.830
She's an author of
the bestseller book

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.150
called "Zero Waste Home," which
I recommend you pick up a copy.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.200
She's a zero waste
lifestyle expert,

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.860
so she'll be a
great person to hear

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.520
some tips on for
your personal lives

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.790
and what you can do to simply
reduce your waste streams.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.220
She'll talk about how living
waste-free can not only

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.310
be stylish, but lead to
significant health benefits

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.750
and reduce cost savings and
just improve your general lives,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.967
in general.

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:03.800
She was a grand prize
winner of Green Award.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.520
She's invited to speak at
events like this all the time.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.510
She's told me this-- today
she's done over 100 probably,

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.770
talks like this at
universities and conferences

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:12.830
throughout the world.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.620
She's going to Brazil in a
month to talk more about it.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.930
BEA JOHNSON: It's nothing new.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.554
JEFF CARLONI: It's
not, I'm ad-libbing.

00:03:18.554 --> 00:03:19.974
It's crazy.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:21.890
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: The
embargo just got broken.

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.806
JEFF CARLONI: I'll just
end with "The New York

00:03:23.806 --> 00:03:26.530
Times" called her the "Priestess
of waste-free living."

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.230
I like that title.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.410
She's a spokesperson for zero
waste lifestyle, clearly.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.870
And then so welcome, Bea.

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:33.850
BEA JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.456
JEFF CARLONI: To her right, we
have Bettina, Bettina Limaco.

00:03:36.456 --> 00:03:37.414
Am I saying that right?

00:03:37.414 --> 00:03:38.420
BETTINA LIMACO: Yes.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.128
JEFF CARLONI: She's
the owner of Green11.

00:03:40.128 --> 00:03:42.720
So Green11 is a refill
store in San Francisco.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:44.750
They have two locations
in San Francisco

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.230
and a partner
location in San Mateo.

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.950
Essentially their claim is
refill is the new recycle.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.190
So if you go to their store,
expect to bring your own jars

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.690
and bring your own
bags and refill.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.000
Everything's bulk packaging.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.320
Her goals are to challenge
the standards of consumerism

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.610
by modeling and promoting the
idea of refill, not landfill,

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.990
and make sustainable living
attainable by offering

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.900
eco-conscious products
for refilling.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.700
Her store's been featured
on SBC and "SF Magazine's"

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.300
"Best of the Bay" series.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.769
I certainly hope someday it'll
be a nationwide phenomenon

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.190
because we all could live
better lives with less waste.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.600
So welcome, Bettina.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.579
BETTINA LIMACO: Thanks.

00:04:24.579 --> 00:04:26.120
JEFF CARLONI: All
right, I'll kind of

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.161
start off by asking, I'll
start with you Michael,

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:30.280
since you're to my right.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.880
Give us a higher
level overview, how

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.460
are we doing as a nation
in terms of waste?

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.040
What are some of the challenges
that you see in this industry?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.250
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: Terrible
in many ways, better

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.910
in a lot of ways,
and some folks,

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.140
both on an individual level,
company level, community level,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.710
are doing better than others.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.890
So I think the
sort of core issue

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.310
here for us as a
country is we produce

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.170
far more waste than
our population density

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.390
in the world.

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.780
So part of that is our
high level of consumption,

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.230
but it is also over the
last 50 years the move

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.400
to a much more sort of
disposable culture--

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.870
the emergence of
things like fast food

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.700
wrappers and packaging, bottled
water is a thing that we talk

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.080
about quite a bit, a
whole series of sort

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.720
of "convenience items"
that have been created.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:37.150
There is also just the
growth in packaging and sort

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.150
of all of these kinds of
things wrapped together make

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:44.090
for a quite wasteful society.

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.580
As I mentioned, though,
there are places that

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.200
are doing some incredible work.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.570
San Francisco and other cities
that are doing zero waste

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.236
work at the municipal
level to make sure

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:56.440
that they're diverting more
of their waste from landfills

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.520
either by recycling
or composting.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.870
Municipal compost
programs are fantastic.

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.362
And then there are companies.

00:06:04.362 --> 00:06:06.820
I think there's probably not
a company in the United States

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.280
now that doesn't have some
sort of a sustainability plan

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.740
that either their employees
at work, making sure

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.380
that they are having less
impact on the earth, but then

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:21.550
also companies figuring out
how to use renewable energy,

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.930
how to create zero
waste campuses, just how

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.510
to operate in a way that
takes more care of the planet.

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.480
JEFF CARLONI: So what's
the problem with waste?

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:35.328
What are the human
health impacts?

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:38.230
What relationship are there
between waste and greenhouse

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:39.530
gases and things like that?

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:41.310
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: I was going to
say, how much time do we have?

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:42.110
JEFF CARLONI: Not that much.

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.280
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: So
waste is a big problem.

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.380
We'll take one example.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.340
In terms of human health, we've
been doing quite a bit of work

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:48.850
recently.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.829
We were talking
about on microbeads,

00:06:51.829 --> 00:06:53.620
which are the little
plastic beads that are

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.860
used in personal care products.

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.870
Companies have
basically replaced

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.930
sort of organic materials
in facial cleansers and body

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.410
scrubs and even toothpaste
with microplastics.

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.880
Those microplastics wash
through water treatment

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.900
into the environment.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.470
They are the size of fish food.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.136
Fish eat them.

00:07:12.136 --> 00:07:13.760
We've done research
for the last couple

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.270
of years that shows
fish are actually

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.130
eating these microplastics
in the environment.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.240
Part of the problem
is plastics are fatty,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.454
so they attract the toxins
in the water around them.

00:07:25.454 --> 00:07:26.870
Fish eat them.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:28.570
That magnifies up
the food chain.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:33.420
So I think many of us
who grew up with an idea

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.330
that waste goes away
somewhere, and I think

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:38.750
one of the big challenges we
have is to get over this idea

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.920
that there really is no "away."

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:45.970
We live on this
floating blue ball

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:50.150
bumping around the universe
and there is only one planet.

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.850
Unless someone figures out a
way to colonize another one,

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:54.960
we've got to be here.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:00.140
And so from impacts on food
to fence line communities who

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:03.740
live along dumps
or incinerators,

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.000
the ways that we deal
with waste have impacts.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.850
And then I think just
generally, societally,

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:16.530
really the sort of throwaway
culture, the sort of fast food,

00:08:16.530 --> 00:08:19.590
run through products,
toss products, the fact

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:22.160
that things aren't made
to last the way they used

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.191
to be, I think that
actually says something

00:08:24.191 --> 00:08:26.190
about our society and is
a reflection of the way

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.820
that we live, and it's
not a positive reflection.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.476
So I think there's impacts
across the spectrum.

00:08:34.476 --> 00:08:35.880
JEFF CARLONI: Great, thank you.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.190
And kind of to that point, you
just kind of touched on this,

00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.610
but our society I feel is very
much built on the principle

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:44.260
that more is better-- more
growth, more money, more stuff,

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:46.140
GDP always has to be rising.

00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:48.804
That equals a better life
for our families, right?

00:08:48.804 --> 00:08:50.720
But this quest for more
often leads many of us

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.570
to the keeping up with the
Joneses kind of mentality,

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:57.830
and I guess my question for
Bea is how do you tell people

00:08:57.830 --> 00:08:59.160
to keep up with the Johnsons?

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.642
What's your way?

00:09:00.642 --> 00:09:02.600
How can you change the
paradigm from keeping up

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.820
with the Joneses to keeping
up with the Johnsons?

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.320
BEA JOHNSON: I can't tell
anyone how to live their lives.

00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.665
I think it's up to everyone
to live the way they want.

00:09:10.665 --> 00:09:16.430
All I can do from my point of
view is to live by example.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:19.290
I think we've been
able to show even

00:09:19.290 --> 00:09:22.750
just in our immediate
friendships and family

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.590
and even now
throughout the world

00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:27.720
that by living simply
and by wasting less,

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.950
we're actually
able to live more.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.400
Today by thanks to
wasting less, we've

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.000
been able to turn
our life from instead

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.420
of being based on stuff, today
it's based on experiences.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.880
It's made our life
so much richer.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.530
It's allowed us to create
memories to last a lifetime,

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.336
and memories last so
much longer than stuff.

00:09:49.336 --> 00:09:50.082
Yeah, definitely.

00:09:50.082 --> 00:09:52.040
She was here earlier
doing a talk, like I said,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.460
and she had some great slides
show all her vacations.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.566
And I'm going on vacation
tomorrow, by the way,

00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:57.983
so I was very
excited to see that.

00:09:57.983 --> 00:10:00.482
And it's true because a lot of
times, our stuff kind of ends

00:10:00.482 --> 00:10:01.090
up owning us.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.780
You have to maintain it
and clean it constantly.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:05.090
And the less you have, the
more you can go out and live.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:07.006
BEA JOHNSON: Well, if
you don't buy packaging,

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.460
if you buy only
what you need, then

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:12.770
you can invest your money
into things that matter

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.430
instead of spending-- every
time you buy packaging

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:19.280
or a disposable product, it's
literally investing your money

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.965
into the landfill,
investing your money into

00:10:21.965 --> 00:10:25.500
or basically throwing
your money out the window.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.660
Once you regain that
power and you decide,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.850
no, I'm not throwing my
money out the window,

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.690
then you can put your
money into something

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.410
that creates memories.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:37.304
Invest your money
into experiences.

00:10:37.304 --> 00:10:39.970
JEFF CARLONI: What would you say
to those people that have kids?

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.930
Like you have two kids,
and I know for me,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.920
it's sometimes hard to
get other people on board.

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:46.670
Do they think you were
crazy the first day

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.570
you started doing this,
or how did they feel

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:48.940
about the whole zero waste?

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:50.190
BEA JOHNSON: I have teenagers.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.350
They still think I'm crazy.

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.890
There is nothing I
can do about that.

00:10:53.890 --> 00:10:56.090
And I can't even
predict the future.

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.590
I can't tell whether
my kids will do

00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.030
zero waste when they grow up.

00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:03.630
It's up to them to find the
life that they want to live,

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:05.600
but I feel comfortable
as a mother knowing

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.070
that I am giving them the tools
to live a waste-free lifestyle

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:10.417
if they choose to do it later.

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:18.770
I think whatever, doesn't
matter how we're raised,

00:11:18.770 --> 00:11:21.440
I think the way-- or I should
say the way we're were raised

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.680
is the way we accept things.

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:26.930
I think my kids are
being raised waste-free,

00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:28.380
but to them, it's the norm.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:31.240
And even if they choose
to rebel against it,

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.270
I know that they will return
back to basics and to what

00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.380
they've been taught.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.185
I think they've been able
to show their friends

00:11:40.185 --> 00:11:42.560
that our lifestyle is actually
quite cool because they've

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.300
been able to do things that
their friends would love

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:47.910
to do, and their friends
are telling their parents,

00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:49.700
why can't we do
like the Johnsons?

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:52.090
Why can't we do
this and do that?

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.850
But it's just that we're able
to do these things because we're

00:11:54.850 --> 00:11:55.650
not wasting.

00:11:55.650 --> 00:12:00.229
That's where sometimes
the connection is missed.

00:12:00.229 --> 00:12:02.270
JEFF CARLONI: That's where
I'll trying to keep up

00:12:02.270 --> 00:12:04.350
with the Johnsons, very good.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:05.320
Great, thank you.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.694
Bettina, this
question's for you.

00:12:06.694 --> 00:12:10.470
What are some challenges of
operating a refill-only store?

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:14.250
Do you have customers, people
coming and going, what do I do?

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:15.420
Tell me some examples.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:17.795
BETTINA LIMACO: Yeah, actually
they do that all the time.

00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:20.509
They actually come in, and
many people that sort of just

00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:22.550
walk by our store have
lived in the neighborhoods

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:25.840
where we operate and really
have no idea what we do.

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.569
So they think we're
a chemical store

00:12:27.569 --> 00:12:29.610
and then they finally make
it in after five years

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:31.836
and come in and ask
exactly what we do.

00:12:31.836 --> 00:12:33.460
And then we describe
the concept, which

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:35.600
is we operate a refill shop.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.590
So we encourage you to
bring in your own container,

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:42.380
to buy everyday products you
need like laundry, shampoo

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:44.690
and conditioner, and dish
soap and anything that

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.450
comes in a plastic
packaging, and we just

00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:53.995
refill the bottles for you for
everyday products you need.

00:12:53.995 --> 00:12:55.870
I think one of the
biggest challenges of that

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.460
is really a change in behavior.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.120
So it takes a long
time for people

00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.640
to sort of remember to bring
in a bottle and to refill it.

00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:07.090
So a lot of times, we
get people buying bottles

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.650
in the store to start,
and then once they've

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:13.180
seen the effect of throwing
less bottles in the blue bin,

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:16.020
then I think it becomes
a very big habit.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.770
So within my initially
only refill laundry,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.317
but once they've
refilled laundry,

00:13:21.317 --> 00:13:23.150
then they start to
think, oh, wait a minute,

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:24.640
can I refill the dish soap?

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:26.320
I wonder if they
have this product.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.310
And so our offerings
of refill products

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.300
have actually increased
over time, so now

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.420
we actually have
things like toothpaste

00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.130
that we refill and
deodorant, and you

00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:40.270
see more and more companies
kind of rethinking

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:45.130
the way they distribute products
so that it's a refill idea.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:47.067
JEFF CARLONI: And the
company's called Green11

00:13:47.067 --> 00:13:49.400
and you told me earlier that
was because initially there

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:50.730
was 11 product offerings.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:52.090
How many products are there now?

00:13:52.090 --> 00:13:53.673
BETTINA LIMACO: I
don't actually know.

00:13:53.673 --> 00:13:56.104
It's probably double
that, so like toothpaste

00:13:56.104 --> 00:13:58.020
is one of the most recent
additions we've had,

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.195
and then recently we have
SPF, face and body SPF.

00:14:01.195 --> 00:14:02.028
BEA JOHNSON: You do?

00:14:02.028 --> 00:14:02.528
Yes!

00:14:02.528 --> 00:14:03.980
BETTINA LIMACO: Yeah.

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:04.850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.690
And also now you can
change your packaging.

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:12.850
You can now have
unmarked packaging.

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:17.890
You can use glass
and mason jars.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:20.381
We see them come
through the store.

00:14:20.381 --> 00:14:20.880
And so--

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.850
BETTINA LIMACO:
Whatever you have.

00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:23.766
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:25.670
BETTINA LIMACO: That's
right, that's right.

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:27.544
And we sell everything
by the weighted ounce.

00:14:27.544 --> 00:14:31.170
So if you brought in a giant
bottle, a glass bottle,

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:33.340
we'd weigh it out and
then we'd just refill it,

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.669
so you pay for the product
that you actually need.

00:14:36.669 --> 00:14:38.210
And I don't know if
many of you know,

00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:42.170
but for every dollar you spend
on anything in the store,

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:45.460
probably like let's say a dish
soap, it's probably $0.20,

00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:47.810
the cost of the dish.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:51.230
And everything else is the cost
of supply chain distribution.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.320
So packaging, the
amount of time spent

00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:56.490
on a label and what
shade of yellow that

00:14:56.490 --> 00:15:04.139
should be is enormous, and
so it's a non-value add cost.

00:15:04.139 --> 00:15:06.680
JEFF CARLONI: So what about the
requirements on the back end?

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.990
So you get products
in, I assume, in bulk.

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:12.100
How do you kind of hold your
suppliers to the same standards

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.655
that you're giving
to your customers?

00:15:13.655 --> 00:15:15.654
BETTINA LIMACO: That's
actually a great question

00:15:15.654 --> 00:15:18.300
because the average person
that refills-- or we have

00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:20.730
some customers in our store
that refill because we're just

00:15:20.730 --> 00:15:23.740
plain cheaper for really
high-end products,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:26.710
and they don't think
past what we do.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:28.890
So when you refill
from Green11, it's

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.930
a true closed-loop distribution.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:33.830
So we order all of our
laundry in 55-gallon drums,

00:15:33.830 --> 00:15:36.920
and all of our dish soap
and most of our cleaners

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:38.910
come in concentrate
and we mix it ourselves

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.660
at our distribution center.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.500
And our 55-gallon jugs that
we receive in a distribution

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:50.220
center are repartnered with a
company in central California

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:54.370
who comes and collects
all those 55-gallon drums

00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.810
and rebreaks them down
into little blue pellets

00:15:56.810 --> 00:16:01.350
that can be reblown into
new 55-gallon drums.

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:04.000
So it's a true
closed-loop distribution.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.137
There isn't any waste.

00:16:05.137 --> 00:16:06.970
JEFF CARLONI: So did
those suppliers already

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:08.960
have that kind of
process, or did

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.220
you kind of have to force
them to change the process

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:12.170
to have that?

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:15.154
BETTINA LIMACO: No, they already
produced in 55-gallon drums.

00:16:15.154 --> 00:16:16.570
JEFF CARLONI: Cool,
so it wouldn't

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.630
be so difficult for
other entrepreneurs

00:16:18.630 --> 00:16:20.520
to potentially set
up a similar store?

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:20.950
BETTINA LIMACO: That's right.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:21.850
JEFF CARLONI: Anywhere
else in the country?

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:23.350
BETTINA LIMACO:
That's right, and we

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:26.140
get reached out from
everywhere, actually--

00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:29.290
not just around the country,
but everywhere-- for help

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.270
to open up a refill shop
in their neck of the woods,

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:34.960
and we're very happy
to help people do that.

00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.830
We think there's room
for this business,

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:40.400
and we actually need
people to be inspired by it

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.130
and open refill
shops everywhere.

00:16:43.130 --> 00:16:45.490
And we've done it, so we
have a couple of partners

00:16:45.490 --> 00:16:47.224
in Wisconsin, for example.

00:16:47.224 --> 00:16:48.070
JEFF CARLONI: Great.

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.090
Franchising opportunity, great.

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.340
OK, we'll come back
to you, Michael.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.640
Talk about manufactured demand,
if you could for a second,

00:16:57.640 --> 00:16:59.635
and specifically,
I'm curious the kind

00:16:59.635 --> 00:17:01.010
of the rise over
the last I don't

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:03.760
know 15, 20 years of the
single-use water bottle

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:06.780
because I know we talk
about that a lot here.

00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.200
How have we been so convinced
that water-bottle water

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.130
is healthier and more
convenient for us

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.819
when really in
actuality, it costs more,

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.487
it's probably not as
healthy, and it has

00:17:17.487 --> 00:17:18.737
all the environmental impacts?

00:17:20.453 --> 00:17:22.369
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: Well,
one, I would encourage

00:17:22.369 --> 00:17:24.861
people to watch "The
Story of Bottled Water"

00:17:24.861 --> 00:17:27.069
if you haven't seen or
already, which basically tells

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:29.410
the story of bottled
water, but really tells

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:31.160
the story of
manufactured demand.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.460
So manufactured
demand in essence is,

00:17:34.460 --> 00:17:37.200
how do you convince
people to buy something

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:39.200
like bottled water that
they can already get

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.890
virtually free from the tap?

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.580
Bottled water costs
many times what

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.470
it would cost you
just to go and fill up

00:17:47.470 --> 00:17:50.320
your glass with tap water.

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.630
So a couple of things.

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:56.192
One, the environmental movement,
I think-- one of the reasons

00:17:56.192 --> 00:17:58.150
we got involved in
environmental communications

00:17:58.150 --> 00:17:59.524
is the environmental
movement did

00:17:59.524 --> 00:18:02.680
a very good job over
the last 30 years

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:06.640
for some very good
reasons of scaring people,

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.644
of convincing people that there
was danger in their water,

00:18:10.644 --> 00:18:12.060
that there was
danger in the soil,

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:15.910
that there's danger lurking
around every corner.

00:18:15.910 --> 00:18:20.940
And the bottled water industry,
which is a quite new industry.

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:23.350
I know bottled water didn't
exist when I was a kid,

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.740
and I'm not that old.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:28.480
It existed, but it
was like Perrier.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.340
It was this sort of odd thing
that wealthy people used.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.430
And we were talking earlier.

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.840
When I was a kid, I don't
remember taking water

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.980
to ball games, or we've
kind of become very obsessed

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.610
with having water
on us at all times.

00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.110
But basically, the
bottled water industry

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:48.440
went out and did a very good
job of convincing people

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.550
through advertising,
through marketing

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:53.850
that their water was unsafe.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:19:00.700
And so we've done now over
the last decade quite a number

00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.130
of side-by-side
taste tests, we've

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.410
done reviews of water safety.

00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:11.690
For most Americans, their
tap water is quite safe.

00:19:11.690 --> 00:19:12.850
There's no problem with it.

00:19:12.850 --> 00:19:14.391
There are certainly
communities where

00:19:14.391 --> 00:19:16.840
there are more issues
with the water that

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:18.820
comes out of the tap.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:21.130
Every time we talk
about this issue,

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.339
we get people talking
about water fluoridation,

00:19:24.339 --> 00:19:24.880
for instance.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.838
That's something that
concerns a lot of people.

00:19:26.838 --> 00:19:28.870
But generally
speaking, the water

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.870
that comes out of the tap
in homes and businesses

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:33.980
around the United
States is quite safe.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:41.440
The bottled water industry at
some level has now shifted,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.370
and their argument now, which I
think is actually quite smart,

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:49.720
is around sort of choice,
is around giving people

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.470
a choice between a
sugar-sweetened beverage

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:55.410
like a soda or a fruit
juice, and water,

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.680
which is a healthier choice.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:20:00.120
So they've sort of shifted their
marketing from fear tactics

00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.020
around safety of water,
what comes out of your tap,

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:09.000
to bottled water being the sort
of safer choice for people who

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.590
are health-conscious and
are concerned about things

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:15.780
like weight gain and diabetes
and all the kinds of things

00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:18.880
that come with
drinking too much soda.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.440
So, yeah, they've
done an incredible job

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:25.140
of convincing people that
they needed this product.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.840
Now, some of it also was making
it the sort of elegant choice.

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:33.030
It was around convenience
and those kinds of things.

00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.250
But fundamentally, when you
ask most people why they're

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.080
drinking it, it's
either convenience

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.200
or some sort of a fear
about their own water.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.430
What we say to folks is if
you are actually concerned

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:44.990
about what's coming
out of your tap,

00:20:44.990 --> 00:20:49.580
it is much cheaper and
more cost-effective

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.140
and more
environmentally friendly

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.200
just use a filter on your tap.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.070
You can get filters
for taps now or use

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.640
a Brita or something like that.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.370
But bottled water, unless
it's like an emergency kind

00:21:02.370 --> 00:21:04.730
of situation-- this is the
other argument they use,

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:07.647
but what about
natural disasters?--

00:21:07.647 --> 00:21:09.730
bottled water is just
something that people really

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:14.630
don't for the large part need.

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:17.161
JEFF CARLONI: So
what role should us

00:21:17.161 --> 00:21:19.250
trying to individually
change people's behavior

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:22.300
versus government
regulation, what sort of mix

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.901
do you see kind of working
for things like that?

00:21:24.901 --> 00:21:26.900
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: So I
think a couple of-- well,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.200
I think around bottled water,
the most important thing,

00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.694
businesses, communities--
so there's a great story.

00:21:33.694 --> 00:21:35.882
A university-- it was
University of Florida

00:21:35.882 --> 00:21:37.340
or Florida State,
one or the other,

00:21:37.340 --> 00:21:38.790
built a new stadium within them.

00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:41.240
I think it was about
10, 12 years ago.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:48.370
And Coke, I think, was the
water distributor, basically

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:50.050
convinced the stadium
builders that they

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:53.150
didn't need many water
fountains because we're going

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:54.484
to be selling bottled water.

00:21:54.484 --> 00:21:55.650
So they have the first game.

00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:58.340
It was an opening football game.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:01.140
It was like a 98-degree
day or something like that,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.530
and no one wanted to buy
a $4 bottle of water.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:06.620
And so they had all
of these health issues

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.960
and basically the city
went to them and said,

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.240
you've got to figure out
how to get more water in.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.810
So the things that businesses,
communities, folks can do

00:22:13.810 --> 00:22:16.670
is one, reinvest in
water infrastructure.

00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:19.080
We are underinvesting
in water infrastructure

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.580
in a massive way.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.960
Businesses like
Google and others--

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.400
super important,
if people really

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.470
feel the need for filtered
water, to put refill stations.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.260
SFO, the airport now, has them.

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:34.760
A lot of the airports
have them now.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.410
You can't carry water
through the security, anyway,

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:41.360
but you can carry a
refillable container,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:46.530
and now they have I think they
call them "hydration stations."

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.040
City of San Francisco
passed an ordinance

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:52.760
that basically barred
sales of bottled water

00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.400
on city property-- so festivals
and those kinds of things.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:23:01.910
But part of that
law was you actually

00:23:01.910 --> 00:23:04.590
have to have sufficient
water infrastructure

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.302
for those events.

00:23:05.302 --> 00:23:07.260
If you're going to take
away the bottled water,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:08.968
you've got to have
the ability for people

00:23:08.968 --> 00:23:11.190
to actually get water, as well.

00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:15.060
So really water infrastructure
and the ability of people

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.710
to get the water that they want
so that they're not using soda

00:23:17.710 --> 00:23:22.749
if they don't want to is the
most important thing, I think.

00:23:22.749 --> 00:23:24.040
JEFF CARLONI: Great, thank you.

00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:24.890
I'll kind of take a break here.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.931
Does anyone have a question
burning in their mind

00:23:26.931 --> 00:23:29.270
before I continue asking
my list of questions?

00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:30.820
Yes, Jamie?

00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.620
JAMIE: So I think it's
really interesting

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:36.632
to see that, Michael, we've
got this big landscape of waste

00:23:36.632 --> 00:23:37.590
and the story of stuff.

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:41.099
And then Bea, we
have a lifestyle,

00:23:41.099 --> 00:23:43.390
your own personal lifestyle
story, and then all the way

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:47.450
down to Bettina, who's able to
do at this kind of micro level.

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:50.060
Can the two ladies
talk about how

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.420
to sort of transition
away from a life of stuff

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.210
to a life of less stuff,
because I always feel really

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:59.390
guilty having my
stuff, but I don't

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:02.440
know if I know the right
way to transition away.

00:24:04.906 --> 00:24:06.280
BEA JOHNSON: I
give a lot of tips

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.410
in the book on how to do that.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:13.890
It obviously to
me, I think the way

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:15.710
I started decluttering
is I was put

00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:19.660
in a situation where we moved
from one area into another.

00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:21.630
We rented an
apartment for a year,

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.260
and we only moved
with the necessities,

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:26.870
and that's when we realized
that, wow, living with less

00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:27.480
is awesome.

00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.370
You actually have more
time on your hands

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:31.570
to do the things
that you enjoy doing.

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:34.380
And so then from there,
it kind of led us

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:39.800
to really adopting
voluntary simplicity.

00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:42.800
My husband was more stuck
on certain things than I am.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.440
He said because
he's sentimental.

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.100
I think just he's macho.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.530
I think that he was
hanging onto certain toys

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:54.000
because he felt like it made
him a man, extra, like a kayak,

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.900
golf clubs that he barely used.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.310
But then as we
started really seeing

00:25:00.310 --> 00:25:08.120
the great positive advantages or
effects of living simply, then

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.320
to me, you kind of
become addicted to it.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.560
You kind of let go and
you feel so much better.

00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:16.320
And then you let go more
and then you're like, gosh,

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:16.986
this is awesome.

00:25:16.986 --> 00:25:18.710
It feels so much lighter.

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:21.020
I love the fact that
today, my whole wardrobe

00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:22.630
fits in a carry-on.

00:25:22.630 --> 00:25:24.860
That means that when
I want to go away

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:27.970
for the weekend or a month
or a week, all we have to do

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:33.040
is-- all of us, the four of
us, wardrobes fit in carry-ons.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.970
So when we want to
go away, we just

00:25:34.970 --> 00:25:37.265
throw our wardrobes in a
carry-on and we zip it,

00:25:37.265 --> 00:25:38.140
we're out the door.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:40.520
A cleaning service
comes, cleans the house,

00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.040
and then we have renters
that come and basically

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.730
pay for our vacations.

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.980
When I pack for a trip, I
no longer have to wonder,

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.080
what should I take?

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.180
I'm going to Brazil,
I'm going to Europe,

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.610
I'm going to Iceland
or Patagonia, all

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.870
of different kind of climates.

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:58.590
I don't have to worry
anymore about what to pack.

00:25:58.590 --> 00:26:00.800
I don't have to worry
about losing my luggage.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:04.820
I don't have to go in the
check-in lines anymore.

00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:06.750
There is a bunch of
things that somehow when

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:10.140
you start simplifying your life,
you start seeing the advantages

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:12.370
and you're like,
I can't go back.

00:26:12.370 --> 00:26:13.380
I don't want more stuff.

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:14.840
I want even less.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:17.410
And today, I'll wake up with a
smile on my face every morning

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:20.720
not because I generated just
a quart size of waste per year

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.570
for my family of four, I wake
up with a smile on my face

00:26:23.570 --> 00:26:26.710
because living simply rocks.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:28.970
It just has turned
our life around

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:32.300
to a life based on
experiences instead of stuff,

00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.720
and that's what it is.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:37.610
And living in those experiences
has brought our family closer.

00:26:40.260 --> 00:26:43.195
I just could not envision going
back to the way I used to live.

00:26:43.195 --> 00:26:47.730
So I think if you just
start decluttering, then

00:26:47.730 --> 00:26:51.050
once you feel how much
better you feel, then

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.900
it pushes you to go further.

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.650
BETTINA LIMACO: And I
sort of second that.

00:26:55.650 --> 00:26:58.210
I think it's a tough question.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.730
I also started the
shop from a sabbatical.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.320
We traveled for a year,
actually Green11 11

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.510
started from us seeing very
massive amounts of plastic

00:27:06.510 --> 00:27:11.779
on the shores of Mount
Sinai in Egypt, actually,

00:27:11.779 --> 00:27:14.320
and that's when we started the
business, is when we returned.

00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.870
But I think it's
definitely starting slowly.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:20.040
I don't think you have to
feel guilty about anything,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.910
but it's really asking
yourself, do I really

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:24.510
need five bottles of
shampoo in my shower?

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.480
Do I really need
another necklace,

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.100
or do I really need
another pair of shoes?

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.060
I think it's starting
slowly and it's

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.850
starting with immediate
things, like do you really

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:36.909
need to buy that, is a way to--

00:27:36.909 --> 00:27:38.450
BEA JOHNSON: And
something you can do

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:39.950
is if there is
something you feel

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:44.590
you want, then put it on a list
and don't buy it right away.

00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:46.090
I think that's
kind of the problem

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.420
with our immediate
consumption in the US,

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:51.590
is that we want something and
it's just too easy, almost,

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:53.570
to grab it and get it.

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:57.710
If you put it on the list
and let that want work on you

00:27:57.710 --> 00:28:00.454
and see if you truly want it
still at the end of the month.

00:28:00.454 --> 00:28:02.370
I have found that when
I had a list like that,

00:28:02.370 --> 00:28:03.990
by the end of the
month, I either

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.130
realized that I had another
item that could do the same job

00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:09.080
or that I simply don't want it.

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.960
And then once I connected that
whatever-- if I spent money

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.690
on that, that meant
that I couldn't

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:18.217
spend my money on an activity or
doing something with my family.

00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:19.800
Then it kind of
changed things around,

00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.460
and today, I don't even
have one of those lists

00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.880
any more because I don't
buy anything any more.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.250
I haven't bought any new
clothes in like three years,

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:35.940
and it's not that I
don't-- I'm saying new.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:36.755
I buy second-hand.

00:28:37.254 --> 00:28:39.570
BETTINA LIMACO: That's
true, that's a good point.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:42.010
BEA JOHNSON: I shop twice
a year for clothing.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.640
I go mid-April and
mid-October, but it's

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.790
good to actually control
yourself, give yourself

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.420
some limits that way because
then that really helps

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.250
because I used to shop
even if I shop second-hand,

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.247
I would go whenever I
felt I wanted something.

00:28:54.247 --> 00:28:56.830
But then you see something else
and you'll buy something else.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:29:01.160
Especially we as women are
gatherers, men are hunters.

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:03.990
When they go shopping, they go
for one thing, they come home.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:05.170
Women are gatherers.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:06.860
If they go for
something, along the way

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.276
they're going to
pick a few things

00:29:08.276 --> 00:29:10.880
and they come back with
a car full of stuff.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.460
I used to go to
Target in my old life.

00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:18.025
Every week somehow, I was led
to Target, and I would come out,

00:29:18.025 --> 00:29:21.200
I would spend $100
on god knows what.

00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.490
I have no idea today what
I was spending my money on.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:26.250
Obviously not important
stuff because I

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.976
don't go to Target any more.

00:29:28.976 --> 00:29:31.240
But anyway, so I
think giving yourself

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.770
limits like that really helps.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:35.740
So when I go shop for my
wardrobe twice a year,

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.810
so I go mid-April
and mid-October

00:29:37.810 --> 00:29:39.900
because it's the
beginning of two seasons,

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:43.170
then I know exactly what I want.

00:29:43.170 --> 00:29:45.090
I just replace what
needs to be replaced,

00:29:45.090 --> 00:29:48.610
so what I grew tired of--
generally color or patterns,

00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:52.640
and then I stick with my
list and I just love the fact

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.350
that it doesn't cost me
much, it's off in a carry-on,

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:01.160
and really it makes
you feel free.

00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:04.060
It's a weight off
your shoulders.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:06.019
JAMIE: So can I ask one
more tactical question?

00:30:06.019 --> 00:30:08.101
I'm really interested in
the tactical side of this

00:30:08.101 --> 00:30:10.210
because I feel it's something
I think about a lot,

00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:13.480
but then there's all these
hidden wasteful things

00:30:13.480 --> 00:30:14.910
like packaging, for instance.

00:30:14.910 --> 00:30:16.010
Packaging is so wasteful.

00:30:16.010 --> 00:30:18.260
Think about buying toilet
paper in bulk, right?

00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:20.110
It comes in a
little shrink wrap.

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.030
Sometimes it comes
individually wrapped.

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.910
Something like packaging,
how can we avoid packaging?

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:28.160
I know buying in
bulk, that's easy,

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.970
but I feel like
you have to be very

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:32.470
strategic about the places you
go and the things that you do

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:36.030
and what about buying, I don't
know, headphones or something

00:30:36.030 --> 00:30:38.080
and it comes in that
huge plastic thing?

00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:42.430
Can you talk about ways to avoid
packaging but still getting

00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:43.944
some of the things we want?

00:30:43.944 --> 00:30:45.360
BETTINA LIMACO: I
think buying off

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.091
Craigslist is a one, buying
used instead of buying new is

00:30:49.091 --> 00:30:50.340
one avenue of getting rid of--

00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.215
BEA JOHNSON: Yeah, that's
all my family does.

00:30:52.215 --> 00:30:54.580
If you're looking for
something super specific

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.580
that you're not going to
find at a thrift store,

00:30:56.580 --> 00:30:57.910
then we fall back on eBay.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:01.440
And when we shop on eBay,
we select the option

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.270
in the left-hand
column that says

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.430
second-hand or
used or pre-owned,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:07.952
and that's all we're all seeing.

00:31:07.952 --> 00:31:09.410
It gives you quite
a bit of choice.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:10.810
Believe me, there is everything.

00:31:10.810 --> 00:31:12.590
I even buy my matches on eBay.

00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:15.750
I don't buy new matches,
I buy second-hand matches.

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:18.430
They are vintage and
they're really pretty.

00:31:18.430 --> 00:31:21.550
But so you can
literally find anything.

00:31:21.550 --> 00:31:25.110
So when there is something super
specific like that that I need

00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:27.180
and that I know I won't
find in a thrift store,

00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.640
then I fall back on eBay.

00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.780
I check that option and
then when I sent out to me,

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.932
I make sure that they send it
to me in paper or cardboard.

00:31:35.932 --> 00:31:38.030
And then if it's a
bigger item, I also

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:41.950
obviously look on Craigslist
for something more local.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:44.930
I wanted to also add a
little bit to your question

00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:48.000
earlier, especially,
well, for clothing,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.480
there is a couple of things.

00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:56.620
Number one is in a regular
closet, in a regular closet,

00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.190
people only use 20%
of their clothes.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:04.600
The other 80%, people
hang onto for the what if.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.900
What if I gain weight?

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.140
What if I lose weight?

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.780
What if I have a
wedding to go to?

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.000
What if I have this event?

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.090
What if I miss it?

00:32:11.090 --> 00:32:14.540
It's been given to me, what if
I feel guilty if I donate it?

00:32:14.540 --> 00:32:18.140
But the thing is, you
know exactly what the 20%

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.780
are because they're the clothes
that you keep on picking.

00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:22.380
They're the clothes that
you keep on washing.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:23.504
They're on top of the pile.

00:32:23.504 --> 00:32:25.614
They're in the
front of your closet

00:32:25.614 --> 00:32:28.030
because they're the ones that
you feel most comfortable in

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.630
and keep on wearing.

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.730
When you let go
of something, you

00:32:31.730 --> 00:32:34.770
have to understand that you
are helping the environment.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:37.100
A lot of people don't
really see that link,

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:38.920
but every time that
you donate something,

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:42.690
you're putting a very valuable
resource back on the market.

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:45.263
You're making it available
for someone else that either

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:47.020
needs it or is looking
for that thing,

00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:50.160
and then they can buy it
secondhand, such as my family.

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:52.960
So if you guys have
a pair of sneakers,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:56.680
Adidas size 9 and
1/2, please donate it

00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:00.280
because those are
really hard to find.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.851
But every time you
donate something,

00:33:01.851 --> 00:33:03.350
you're putting it
back on the market

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.680
to make it available to
someone and you're boosting

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.720
the second-hand market.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.320
The second-hand
market is extremely

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.090
important for the
future of zero waste,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:13.770
so please let go of the
things you're not truly using.

00:33:16.962 --> 00:33:17.920
JEFF CARLONI: Go ahead.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.336
MICHAEL O'HEANEY:
Just one thing--

00:33:19.336 --> 00:33:21.910
packaging is a huge
pain point for people.

00:33:21.910 --> 00:33:22.920
People hate packaging.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.290
They love to hate packaging.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:30.620
I have a nine-year-old daughter,
and birthdays and holidays

00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:34.500
are just the worst because
you open a couple of presents

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.900
and you're left with this
pile of plastic and paper

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:40.780
and cardboard and all
of this awful stuff.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:44.290
There's a ton of stuff you can
do to sort of avoid packaging.

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:46.580
So it's buying in bulk,
it's buying and reuse.

00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:48.590
BEA JOHNSON: Giving the gift of
experiences instead of stuff.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:49.610
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: Giving
the gift of experiences

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.520
instead of stuff.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.050
There's all these
kinds of things.

00:33:52.050 --> 00:33:54.550
I think one of the things around
packaging that's important,

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.760
though, is also to communicate
to the companies that

00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:59.850
are creating the packaging that
you don't like their packaging.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:02.380
And so in Europe,
for instance, there's

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.260
a packaging directive
basically where

00:34:05.260 --> 00:34:07.730
companies have to
take responsibility

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:08.980
for their packaging.

00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:12.550
There's a fee attached to the
packaging that they create,

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:16.210
and there's basically take
back that's required of them,

00:34:16.210 --> 00:34:17.810
so they're paying for it.

00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:19.760
In creating a
financial disincentive

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.820
to create a lot of
packaging, companies

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:25.120
to figure out how to make
less packaging, how to

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:27.110
make things more efficient.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:30.620
Walmart, a company
I'm not a huge fan of,

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.350
has done amazing things
to reduce packaging

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.159
and to shape packages
in certain ways

00:34:36.159 --> 00:34:38.900
so that they can move
more efficiently more

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.290
of their stuff.

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:41.750
This can be done.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:43.870
This is not some sort
of rocket science.

00:34:43.870 --> 00:34:46.790
Things don't have to be
triple-wrapped in plastic

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:49.030
to get safely to you.

00:34:49.030 --> 00:34:52.120
But taking that step,
avoiding plastic is important

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.679
and I think it does in some
ways send a market signal

00:34:55.679 --> 00:35:02.310
to companies that you don't want
to buy their plastic schlock.

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.260
But communicating
that to the companies

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.390
is also very important.

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:08.250
So joining organizations
that are thinking about it,

00:35:08.250 --> 00:35:10.420
supporting organizations
that are doing interesting

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.440
work around packaging.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:14.130
There are some really
great innovative-- Product

00:35:14.130 --> 00:35:16.900
Policy Institute, series
of great organizations

00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:19.320
that are doing work
to reduce packaging

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.850
to reduce the impact
on transportation costs

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:23.812
and energy use, all of
those kinds of things.

00:35:23.812 --> 00:35:25.520
BEA JOHNSON: It's the
power of the voice,

00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.890
and I mentioned that earlier.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:28.516
If you're not happy
with the packaging,

00:35:28.516 --> 00:35:30.806
you feel you're forced to
buy a product that either you

00:35:30.806 --> 00:35:32.640
don't like or you don't
like the packaging,

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.848
then let your voice be heard
because if you don't say

00:35:34.848 --> 00:35:36.430
anything, nothing will change.

00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:38.240
If you send the
packaging back to them

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.290
and propose alternatives, then
you're actually making things

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:43.047
happen and change will happen.

00:35:43.047 --> 00:35:44.630
MICHAEL O'HEANEY:
Take a picture of it

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:46.720
and put it on social
media and tag the company.

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.220
BEA JOHNSON: That
is super powerful.

00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:48.633
JEFF CARLONI: I
was going to say,

00:35:48.633 --> 00:35:50.560
I heard of a story, our
neighbor company here,

00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.850
Intuit, someone asked for
a CD to be sent to them

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:56.690
and they sent it in a huge box
with all this plastic wrap.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:59.220
So the guy made a
YouTube video of, like,

00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:01.090
titled, "Does Intuit
Hate the Environment?"

00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.804
and it got all these
hits and that caught

00:36:02.804 --> 00:36:04.722
the eye of the sustainability
person at Intuit

00:36:04.722 --> 00:36:06.680
and they changed their
whole packaging process.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.930
Now they just send it in a
paper sleeve and that's it,

00:36:08.930 --> 00:36:11.260
and so it can work.

00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.310
That was my
experience with that.

00:36:13.310 --> 00:36:15.680
BEA JOHNSON: I really
believe that when

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.096
I started doing
waste-free living,

00:36:18.096 --> 00:36:20.220
my husband said, you know,
what you're doing really

00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:22.880
doesn't matter, it's really
the big corporations out there

00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:23.760
that matter.

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.090
And I said, I don't agree.

00:36:25.090 --> 00:36:26.750
I believe that we
as the consumer

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:30.190
are leading the manufacturing
world because the manufacturers

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:32.930
only make what we're
buying, so if we buy crap,

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:33.970
they'll make more crap.

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.330
If we buy packaging,
they'll make more packaging.

00:36:36.330 --> 00:36:39.490
If we buy in bulk, then
we're supporting sustainable

00:36:39.490 --> 00:36:42.060
practices and we're
literally voting

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.820
with our money for more bulk
alternatives to be out there.

00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:50.150
So I think it's important to
realize the power of our money,

00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:53.320
and every time we buy
something, it's a way to vote.

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.920
And if we buy right, then we're
basically spending our money

00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:02.461
or investing our money into
a more sustainable future.

00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:03.460
JEFF CARLONI: Thank you.

00:37:03.460 --> 00:37:05.168
Kind of shifting gears
here a little bit.

00:37:05.168 --> 00:37:07.335
Being that California's
in a drought,

00:37:07.335 --> 00:37:09.710
this goes to I guess any of
you that want to answer this,

00:37:09.710 --> 00:37:11.251
is there a direct
connection that you

00:37:11.251 --> 00:37:13.870
can make between reducing waste
and saving water and helping

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.870
out with the drought?

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:19.189
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: So there's
some very direct ways.

00:37:19.189 --> 00:37:20.730
We're working on a
campaign right now

00:37:20.730 --> 00:37:25.520
around water bottling
in California.

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:28.310
Nestle Waters, which is the
world's largest distributor

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:31.790
of bottled water, we're
working on a campaign-- they're

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:37.125
taking water from a spring,
their Arrowhead brand-- well,

00:37:37.125 --> 00:37:39.500
they say it's a spring; we
think it's ground water, which

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:42.740
is actually an important
distinction-- but in the San

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:44.840
Bernardino National Forest.

00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:49.190
And I was saying
earlier before I

00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:52.220
came in, I got an email from
the head of Nestle Waters North

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.086
America apologizing
because we've

00:37:54.086 --> 00:37:56.210
been sort of going to town
the last couple of weeks

00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:58.350
on a quote.

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.500
He during a radio
interview was asked

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.760
if Californians
are asking everyone

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.420
to sacrifice and to
sort of take less water,

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:09.150
would you consider
taking less water?

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:12.080
And he said, no, as a matter
of fact, if I could take more,

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:13.480
I would.

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:19.430
So that's a very direct
case, but water use

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.150
really around
bottled water is not

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:23.180
just the water that's
in it, but the water

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.180
it takes to produce the
plastics, the water that

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:28.750
takes-- the
manufacturing processes.

00:38:28.750 --> 00:38:32.130
Agriculture in California
is really where it's at.

00:38:32.130 --> 00:38:36.190
But I think there are ways
in living a simpler life

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:42.060
and reducing your overall impact
that you can have an impact.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:44.820
I'm floored at some
level by the fact

00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.430
that Californians
over the last year

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:51.090
have reduced their household
water use by 30%, 40%.

00:38:51.090 --> 00:38:53.810
When the governor called
and the water boards

00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.550
and local officials
called and said,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:59.500
we need people to stop using
so much water, people did it.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:00.639
People responded.

00:39:00.639 --> 00:39:01.180
It's amazing.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:01.971
I live in Berkeley.

00:39:01.971 --> 00:39:04.080
It's amazing to
me to drive around

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.690
and the lawns are all brown.

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:09.810
It blows my mind.

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:14.850
So I think there's this
idea that living a simpler

00:39:14.850 --> 00:39:19.150
life, that not partaking
in some of these kinds

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:26.670
of ridiculous products is
somehow a fringe or a weird way

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:31.110
to live or that I'm the only
one who thinks like this

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:33.440
and that no one else thinks
like this, when in truth, I

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:36.320
think most Americans
share a core set

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:40.120
of environmental values and when
asked, when really challenged

00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:43.590
to step up, people do.

00:39:43.590 --> 00:39:45.970
BETTINA LIMACO: Just to
add to the recycling piece,

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.510
I think a lot of people think
that when you throw something

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.520
in blue bin, something
like only 20% of plastics

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.740
actually get upcycled
because there's barely

00:39:56.740 --> 00:40:00.390
any-- think about what
plastic can become.

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:02.970
It can only become,
like, bumpers

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:06.710
that you see for parking
or plastic t-shirts.

00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:10.930
And the amount of water it
takes to produce something out

00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:18.400
of plastic and to upcycle
something is enormous,

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.330
and all it does is delay the
entrance into the landfill.

00:40:21.330 --> 00:40:23.130
So it eventually
all ends up there.

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:25.530
So once you're tired of
that plastic t-shirt,

00:40:25.530 --> 00:40:28.430
once you're tried of
that plastic anything,

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:30.732
it ends up in the
landfill, as well.

00:40:30.732 --> 00:40:32.940
JEFF CARLONI: Yeah, that
was kind of my next question

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.510
is that I think a lot of people,
especially here at Google,

00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:37.590
we have everything is
recyclable and compostable.

00:40:37.590 --> 00:40:39.070
There's very little
actual things

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.260
that are procured by
Google that are actually

00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:43.320
able "landfill waste,"
so I think people

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.640
have kind of a misconception.

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.680
That's fine, we can
consume as much of this

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:50.130
as we want because it's going
to keep coming back forever.

00:40:50.130 --> 00:40:53.510
But to your point, I think it's
something like only 16% or 17%

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:57.130
more efficient use of resources
than making a virgin product.

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:59.310
So all the
transportation and labor

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:02.020
and like all those
inputs you said still

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:04.550
have a great impact
on the environment.

00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:05.900
Yeah, that's a great point.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.150
BEA JOHNSON: And also we've
been told by the marketers

00:41:08.150 --> 00:41:10.490
that buying packaging
or convenience

00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:12.490
products saves time.

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:16.550
My lifestyle saves me way more
time than my old lifestyle

00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:19.190
because, for example, today
I've adopted products that

00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:21.680
are unpackaged, but
they're also less toxic

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:23.190
and they're multi-functional.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:27.900
So for example, to wash
ourselves from like head

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:30.810
to toe, to wash our
hair, our face, our body,

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:33.410
and also to shave, we
use one bar of soap

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:37.030
that we buy loose from the
health food store unpackaged.

00:41:37.030 --> 00:41:39.130
It costs us $2 for that bar.

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:42.107
That bar has eliminated
four other toxic products.

00:41:42.107 --> 00:41:44.440
I no longer have to go to the
store to buy those things.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.500
I no longer have to
put them in my car,

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:49.080
take them up 36
steps to my landing,

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.250
store them, and then
use them, but also

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:54.960
then take all the containers
back down to the curb,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.890
and then go to the
store to buy more.

00:41:56.890 --> 00:42:01.220
And that's one example,
and I have like 100 others.

00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.850
We no longer buy paper towels,
plastic wrap, aluminum foil,

00:42:06.850 --> 00:42:09.390
sandwich baggies,
freezer bags, trash bags.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:11.240
All that stuff are
things that I used

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:14.090
to spend my money on going
to the store and buying.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:17.389
It's actually once you realize
how much time-consuming it is

00:42:17.389 --> 00:42:19.430
and you eliminate it from
your life, you're like,

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.370
damn, I'm never
going back to that.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:25.350
We've been, again, led to
think that it saves time,

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.920
but it really doesn't.

00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:28.920
JEFF CARLONI: Thank you.

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:30.640
This question's actually
for you, too, Bea.

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:32.900
I know you recently gave a
talk at Burning Man, right?

00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:33.816
BEA JOHNSON: Yes, two.

00:42:33.816 --> 00:42:34.890
Actually two.

00:42:34.890 --> 00:42:37.526
JEFF CARLONI: So Burning
Man, for those of you--

00:42:37.526 --> 00:42:39.150
does everyone know
what Burning Man is?

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:40.335
Do I have to explain that?

00:42:40.335 --> 00:42:42.460
OK, so Burning Man is a
festival out in the desert.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:45.210
Basically they have this
mantra, "Leave no trace."

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.877
They go out there,
they build this city,

00:42:46.877 --> 00:42:48.459
and then when they
take the city down,

00:42:48.459 --> 00:42:50.690
there's not a single strand
of anything left behind.

00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:53.330
So being that you were there,
that was your first time there,

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:53.830
right?

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:55.430
BEA JOHNSON: Yeah,
I was a virgin.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:42:57.800
JEFF CARLONI: Yeah,
you were a virgin.

00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:00.030
How did that experience--
you were already

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:02.880
a person of zero waste, so how
did that experience of leave

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.730
no trace, radical self-reliance,
MOOP patrol, all that stuff,

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:09.270
how did that change
your perspective?

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:12.010
BEA JOHNSON: So doing zero
waste there for me was easy

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:15.080
because I already do
backpacking with no waste,

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.520
I buy food in bulk--
that is, dehydrated,

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.880
such as soup mixes and
lentil soup, pea soup, things

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.180
like that, or oatmeal, that
we can then add with hot water

00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.450
and get a meal going.

00:43:30.450 --> 00:43:36.540
And I also brought 20--
I refilled, I should say,

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.420
20 glass bottles of lemonade.

00:43:39.420 --> 00:43:41.900
They don't really like you
to bring glass at Burning Man

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.020
because if you break it,
then it's really hard

00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.370
to remove from the ground.

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:49.250
But I kept it within my tent, so
I knew that if something broke,

00:43:49.250 --> 00:43:52.910
then I could sweep
it and take it home.

00:43:52.910 --> 00:44:01.560
But I really love the leave no
trace principle of Burning Man.

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.050
It's made me much more
aware of my impact.

00:44:05.050 --> 00:44:08.760
When you pack your tent, you're
supposed to really fine-comb

00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:10.990
your area and they
also, of course,

00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:14.200
encourage you to do the
common areas, which I did.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:16.700
But when I
fine-combed my area, I

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.530
was just amazed
to see that I had

00:44:19.530 --> 00:44:25.340
brought in dog hair, pine
needles, and feathers.

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.930
The dog hair and
the pine needles

00:44:27.930 --> 00:44:30.020
were from previous
camp trips that I

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:33.670
had taken with that tent.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.220
I didn't lose much of my
hair because it was literally

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:39.370
stuck to my head between
the dust of the Playa

00:44:39.370 --> 00:44:41.740
and the oils of my head,
it was one big mess.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:42.990
Nothing fell out of it.

00:44:42.990 --> 00:44:45.660
I only found a couple,
but also the feathers

00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:48.410
out of my down sleeping bag.

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.400
I had never really
thought of those things.

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:53.250
To me, they were insignificant
when I had camped before,

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:56.060
but there in the Playa, they
just really seemed out of place

00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.280
and I really enjoyed
picking them up.

00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:01.730
It was almost a spiritual
thing, and it really

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:07.380
made me aware of my impact
and I felt definitely

00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.230
it was a definite step further
from the little picking I've

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.660
done before.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:15.800
It made me feel more connected
also with my environment.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.342
JEFF CARLONI: Great.

00:45:17.342 --> 00:45:18.800
Do they have you
go to Burning Man?

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:21.230
I'm looking at you, Andreas.

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.800
Cool.

00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:23.300
BEA JOHNSON: I
didn't see you there.

00:45:23.300 --> 00:45:25.480
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, where
were you, [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.210
BEA JOHNSON: At Earth Gardens.

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:26.890
JEFF CARLONI: Earth Gardens?

00:45:26.890 --> 00:45:28.098
BEA JOHNSON: And Center Camp.

00:45:28.098 --> 00:45:29.600
JEFF CARLONI: Center Camp?

00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:32.390
MALE SPEAKER: So I really
liked the positive example

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:34.700
you have of this pristine
home and everything's

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.677
so organized because I know
when I accumulate stuff,

00:45:37.677 --> 00:45:39.260
it almost stresses
me out knowing it's

00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:41.040
very hard to find something.

00:45:41.040 --> 00:45:42.300
BEA JOHNSON: But what
you don't have does not

00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.830
need to be organized,
maintained, stored.

00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.871
MALE SPEAKER: I have a
lot of stuff I don't need.

00:45:45.871 --> 00:45:47.700
I was wondering if
on company levels,

00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:50.940
if you guys have
given lots of talks?

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:52.580
And I feel like Google
we do some stuff

00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:55.270
well, some stuff not
so well, but is it

00:45:55.270 --> 00:45:56.710
possible at company
levels you've

00:45:56.710 --> 00:46:00.700
seen anything really outstanding
that you can kind of bring

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.040
along and present that an
entire company might want

00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:08.330
to adopt because--
and maybe if that kind

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:12.329
of company-level action
filters down to the employees

00:46:12.329 --> 00:46:14.120
and they're like, oh,
wow, I should do this

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.820
at home, as well.

00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:20.000
BEA JOHNSON: So my job
is to go to companies

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.040
and talk about my
zero waste lifestyle

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:26.040
to inspire the employees
to adopt some of the things

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.320
we do at home.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:32.020
But interestingly enough,
large corporations

00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:35.430
are seeing this huge zero
waste movement taking

00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:40.000
a lot of weight, and
I can't mention names,

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.410
but very large
manufacturers have

00:46:43.410 --> 00:46:46.610
contacted me to get my
input on the products

00:46:46.610 --> 00:46:49.680
that they have so that
they can make them better.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.020
But I also want to be able
to put products out there

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.660
to attract the zero wasters.

00:46:54.660 --> 00:46:57.040
So whether it be
the jars that I use

00:46:57.040 --> 00:47:01.890
to purchase my wet food or
the cloth bags that I have,

00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:06.980
or even just in the things
that we need in my home,

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.890
I think it's really
exciting to see

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:14.990
that this movement is growing
so much that these corporations

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.820
are noticing.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.800
And the zero waste
lifestyle is just

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:21.910
in line with plastic-free
living, with tiny living,

00:47:21.910 --> 00:47:23.410
with collaborative consumption.

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.500
We're all talking
about the same thing,

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:31.600
and actually even I read
that GE even themselves

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:34.390
have noticed the
interest for tiny living

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.660
and they are looking to adapt
their products to tiny living

00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:42.100
so they can get then those
consumers for themselves.

00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:44.747
But I'm sure you
see it probably?

00:47:44.747 --> 00:47:46.580
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: There's
a ton of companies

00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.788
doing interesting stuff,
both sort of on the consumer

00:47:48.788 --> 00:47:50.830
side, the sort of
consumer-facing side, the way

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.580
that they're actually
dealing with the impact

00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:54.950
of their products.

00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:57.210
So probably not
surprisingly, Patagonia

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:00.297
is a real leader in this area.

00:48:00.297 --> 00:48:02.630
They launched a program I
think two years ago now, maybe

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.950
three years ago,
called Common Threads,

00:48:04.950 --> 00:48:08.370
which is basically they'll
take back their clothing

00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:11.750
and recycle the clothing.

00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:14.492
incredible repair business.

00:48:14.492 --> 00:48:16.200
If you go to Patagonia's
YouTube channel,

00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.420
they have some great
videos that are

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.220
these moving, incredible
videos about this guy who's

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.460
had this anorak for the last
20 years and sent it back

00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:29.250
and Patagonia repairs
it and gives it

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.760
another couple of years of
life, or that kind of thing.

00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.830
So in the
consumer-facing side, I

00:48:33.830 --> 00:48:35.850
think there are a
lot of companies

00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:39.980
doing interesting things around
repair, around take back.

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:42.460
The electronics
industry has done

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:46.760
an enormous amount in the last
10 years around take back.

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:49.430
Still a long ways to go.

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:53.380
There's interesting
folks like iFixit

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:58.100
that is actually basically doing
repair manuals for electronics

00:48:58.100 --> 00:49:00.450
so that you can
crack open your phone

00:49:00.450 --> 00:49:03.440
or whatever it is and
figure out how to fix it

00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:06.000
instead of dumping it.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.860
So there's sort of a lot of
interesting consumer-facing

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.630
stuff.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:11.800
There's great companies
who are figuring out

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:12.780
new ways to do things.

00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:16.080
So like the reason we
use carpet squares now

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:19.860
is this guy, Ray Anderson,
who founded a company called

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:23.220
Interface Carpet and he
figured out a less toxic way

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:26.520
to create carpets, and we use
squares because then you only

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.759
have to replace a square
when it gets worn instead

00:49:28.759 --> 00:49:29.592
of the whole carpet.

00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:37.480
And then just in terms of
campus life for big companies,

00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:42.010
the fact that there is a
compost bin in this room to me

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:43.680
is remarkable.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.790
Food waste is a huge
part of municipal waste,

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:48.670
and not a lot of
folks are set up

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:51.900
to actually do that kind
of waste collection,

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:53.840
so I think that's
important, as well.

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.410
So I think companies
aren't doing

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:58.227
as much as I'd like
them to do, but there

00:49:58.227 --> 00:50:00.060
are a lot of great
companies who are looking

00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:03.710
at how to create better
products for their consumers,

00:50:03.710 --> 00:50:06.920
how to create a better
life for their employees.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.565
We're working with-- again,
not a big surprise company--

00:50:09.565 --> 00:50:11.880
we're working with Ben
and Jerry's right now.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:16.490
All of their scoopers,
the scoop shop employees,

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:18.380
are taking an online
boot camp we have

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.030
around community involvement.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:23.800
They put a sort of big emphasis
on their employees being

00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:27.460
engaged in their
communities, so they

00:50:27.460 --> 00:50:30.330
are trying to do that,
which one of the reasons

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.400
I mention community,
community is

00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.140
kind of the antidote to stuff.

00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.950
So we were talking earlier--
stuff swaps, finding places,

00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:40.540
building, sharing communities.

00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:42.676
Berkeley, we have a
tool-lending library

00:50:42.676 --> 00:50:44.050
that's part of
the public library

00:50:44.050 --> 00:50:46.480
system, which is incredible.

00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:51.610
I don't need all of
these things for myself.

00:50:51.610 --> 00:50:55.490
I rented a dolly,
like a hand cart.

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:57.120
I only need that
maybe once a year.

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:59.504
Why do I need my own,
and probably not everyone

00:50:59.504 --> 00:51:00.670
on my block needs their own.

00:51:00.670 --> 00:51:03.870
I can go to the library with
my library card, get a dolly,

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:06.990
I can get a jack hammer,
I can get garden tools,

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:08.810
you can get hammers
and screwdrivers

00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:11.790
and all the kinds of things
that you would possibly need.

00:51:11.790 --> 00:51:15.590
Instead of going to Home
Depot, I go to the library.

00:51:15.590 --> 00:51:17.020
So communities,
businesses are all

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:19.120
doing super interesting
things, I think.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.078
BEA JOHNSON: And there
is a lot to learn, also,

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:23.190
from other countries.

00:51:23.190 --> 00:51:25.750
Last year when I
went to Brazil, I

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:29.130
was invited to talk about
my lifestyle over there

00:51:29.130 --> 00:51:31.020
as the way of the future.

00:51:31.020 --> 00:51:32.500
Interestingly
enough, I was given

00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:36.166
a tour of a grocery
that does zero waste.

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:37.540
Now, when I entered
that store, I

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.750
thought, oh, well, I can
do zero waste in that store

00:51:39.750 --> 00:51:41.920
because everything was packaged.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:45.100
And I showed up
with my cloth bag

00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:48.500
and I asked if they would put a
pastry in my little cloth bag.

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:51.220
And he said, well, because it's
you, they will, but otherwise,

00:51:51.220 --> 00:51:51.950
they wouldn't.

00:51:51.950 --> 00:51:54.240
And I'm like, OK,
well, that's a shame.

00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:57.980
But on the other side,
in the back of the store,

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:02.220
these guys used to
pay huge tipping fees

00:52:02.220 --> 00:52:05.790
for logging all the packaging
from their supply chain

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:10.360
to landfill, but they figure now
that those materials actually

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:13.190
could be a good
source of profit.

00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:15.740
So they found a
way of separating

00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:19.770
all their different
materials and then were

00:52:19.770 --> 00:52:23.580
matched with recyclers that
then buy those materials.

00:52:23.580 --> 00:52:27.400
They even had a guy in that
grocery store whose job,

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.910
the staff, whose job
it was to separate

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.170
the food from the
packaging, the food

00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:36.660
that they were not able
to donate to a food bank.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:39.140
His job was to separate
the food from the packaging

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:42.340
so then they were able
to compost that food,

00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:45.340
and then they turned around and
they were selling the compost

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:46.840
at the grocery store.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:50.930
So this was an
amazing example to me.

00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:54.750
Over there in Brazil where you
think, we're leading all this

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:56.590
and we'll show the world.

00:52:56.590 --> 00:53:00.210
But no, there are amazing things
that are being done everywhere,

00:53:00.210 --> 00:53:04.690
and those guys realize
that now actually it

00:53:04.690 --> 00:53:07.460
saved them a bunch of money, but
they're also even making money

00:53:07.460 --> 00:53:09.702
from their waste material.

00:53:09.702 --> 00:53:11.160
MICHAEL O'HEANEY:
If you're looking

00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:14.440
for a little inspiration, like
this afternoon when you're back

00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.970
at your desk and you
want check out a video,

00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.432
look at the
Biomimicry Institute.

00:53:19.432 --> 00:53:20.765
You all know what biomimicry is?

00:53:20.765 --> 00:53:27.150
It's basically designers
mimicking natural processes,

00:53:27.150 --> 00:53:29.780
and so it's things
like figuring out

00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:32.160
less toxic ways
to make black dye,

00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:39.500
or how to create fans that
use less energy basically

00:53:39.500 --> 00:53:42.080
by studying how nature
does these things.

00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:44.940
And they have these
just incredible stories

00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:49.700
of companies who figured out
more efficient, less waste,

00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:52.870
less resources wasted in
the production of products

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:54.860
and in the way they make things.

00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:57.850
Biomimicry-- it's a
great site and they

00:53:57.850 --> 00:54:01.132
have some really great examples
of things companies are doing.

00:54:01.132 --> 00:54:02.340
JEFF CARLONI: Thank you guys.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.965
Unfortunately, we're
about out of time,

00:54:03.965 --> 00:54:05.315
but we could do this all day.

00:54:05.315 --> 00:54:07.060
[INAUDIBLE] after
this, but thank

00:54:07.060 --> 00:54:09.310
you so much for coming and
spending your time with us.

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:10.590
Thank you guys all for coming.

00:54:10.590 --> 00:54:11.344
I appreciate it.

00:54:11.344 --> 00:54:13.510
If you want to stick around
and ask questions after,

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:14.426
feel free to do that.

00:54:14.426 --> 00:54:16.050
Just a couple things
I'll encourage you

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.990
do after this event
to learn more.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.930
Go to storyofstuff.org,
watch the videos.

00:54:21.930 --> 00:54:23.640
Check out Bea's book, of course.

00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.120
If you live in the city,
shop at Bettina's store.

00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.750
Those are some easy ways to
reduce your waste stream right

00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:29.340
there.

00:54:29.340 --> 00:54:32.720
Here on campus, carry your
reusable mugs everywhere

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.260
you go, your personal
water bottles.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:38.130
Don't get to-go boxes.

00:54:38.130 --> 00:54:41.060
Again, we vote with our choices,
even when it's free, right?

00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:44.192
So just those are some simple
things you can do here.

00:54:44.192 --> 00:54:45.150
BEA JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:46.316
MICHAEL O'HEANEY: Thank you.

00:54:46.316 --> 00:54:49.340
[APPLAUSE]
