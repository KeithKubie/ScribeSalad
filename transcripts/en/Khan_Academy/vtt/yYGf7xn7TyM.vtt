00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.250
- [Voiceover] Mohamed
decides to track the number

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.019
of leaves on the tree in
his backyard each year.

00:00:05.176 --> 00:00:08.372
The first year, there were 500 leaves.

00:00:08.853 --> 00:00:10.580
Each year thereafter, the number of leaves

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.101
was 40% more than the year before.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:17.325
Let n be a positive integer,
and let f of n denote

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.215
the number of leaves on
the tree in Mohamed's

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.634
back yard in the nth year
since he started tracking it.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.840
The expression f of n defines a sequence.

00:00:26.894 --> 00:00:29.339
What kind of sequence is f of n?

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:31.059
So, some of you might be able to

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:31.933
think about this in your head.

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.473
Each successive year we're growing by 40%,

00:00:34.473 --> 00:00:36.978
that's the same thing
as multiplying by 1.4.

00:00:37.276 --> 00:00:39.450
Each successive term we're multiplying

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.844
or dividing by the same number.

00:00:41.844 --> 00:00:43.126
Well, that's going to be geometric.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:45.219
Let's make that a little
bit more tangible,

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:46.641
just in case.

00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:48.998
So, let's make a little table here.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:51.558
So, table.

00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:54.890
So, this is n and this is f of n.

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:57.084
So when n is equal to one,

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.989
the first year, n equals
one, there were 500 leaves.

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:01.838
F of n is 500.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.681
Now, when n is equal to two we're going

00:01:03.681 --> 00:01:05.875
to grow by 40%, which is the same thing

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:08.035
as multiplying by 1.4.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.327
So 500 times 1.4, let's
do 40% of 500 is 200,

00:01:12.327 --> 00:01:14.298
so we're going to grow by 200, so we're

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:16.011
going to go to 700.

00:01:16.431 --> 00:01:19.194
Then in year three, we're
going to grow by 40%

00:01:19.194 --> 00:01:23.981
of 700, which is 280, so
it's going to grow to 980.

00:01:23.981 --> 00:01:28.376
Notice it's definitely not
an arithmetic sequence.

00:01:28.573 --> 00:01:30.300
An arithmetic sequence, we would be adding

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.425
or subtracting the same amount every time,

00:01:32.425 --> 00:01:33.198
but we're not.

00:01:33.198 --> 00:01:35.371
Here, from 500 to 700, we grew by 200,

00:01:35.371 --> 00:01:37.856
and then from 700 to 980, we grew by 280.

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:40.085
Instead, we're multiplying or dividing by

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.467
the same amount each time.

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:43.748
In this case, we're multiplying by 1.4,

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:45.861
by 1.4 each time.

00:01:45.916 --> 00:01:47.751
So we are clearly geometric.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:49.756
Depending on your answer
to the question above,

00:01:49.756 --> 00:01:51.869
the recursive definition
of the sequence can have

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.535
one of the following two forms.

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:55.221
Well this is the arithmetic form, which

00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:57.009
we know isn't the case,
so it's going to be

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.437
in the geometric form.

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:01.215
And then they ask us, what are the values

00:02:01.215 --> 00:02:03.551
of the parameters A
and B for the sequence?

00:02:03.551 --> 00:02:06.842
So we have our base case
here, f of n is going to be

00:02:06.842 --> 00:02:09.246
equal to A when n is equal to one.

00:02:09.484 --> 00:02:11.190
Well, we know that when n equals one,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.400
we had 500 leaves on the
tree so A, this A over here,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.912
is 500, so A is 500,

00:02:19.637 --> 00:02:21.226
and then if we're not in the base case

00:02:21.226 --> 00:02:22.485
for any other year,

00:02:22.485 --> 00:02:24.720
we are going to have,
let's see, it's going to be

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.814
the previous year, the
previous year times what?

00:02:28.418 --> 00:02:31.039
It's going to be the
previous year grown by 40%,

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:34.860
to grow by 40%, you're
going to multiply by 1.4

00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:37.989
so B is going to be 1.4.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.445
You take the previous
year and you multiply

00:02:39.445 --> 00:02:41.565
by 1.4 for any other year,

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.291
any year other than n equals one.

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.989
So, B is equal to 1.4, and we're done.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:48.425
Let's do another example.

00:02:48.425 --> 00:02:49.915
This is strangely fun.

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:55.089
All right, so this says:
Seo-Yun hosted a party.

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.597
She had 50 party favors
to give away, and she

00:02:58.597 --> 00:03:01.502
gave away three party
favors to each of her guests

00:03:01.502 --> 00:03:03.112
as they arrived at the party.

00:03:03.473 --> 00:03:07.150
Let n be a positive integer,
and let g of n denote

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.706
the number of party
favors Seo-Yun had before

00:03:10.706 --> 00:03:12.906
the nth guest arrived.

00:03:14.078 --> 00:03:16.090
All right, actually, before I
even look at these questions,

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.431
let me make a table here
because they're saying

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:18.818
before the nth guest.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.561
I want to make sure I'm
understanding this properly.

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:25.476
So this is n,

00:03:26.202 --> 00:03:28.122
and then this is going to be g of n,

00:03:28.122 --> 00:03:29.213
right over here.

00:03:29.532 --> 00:03:31.610
So, when n is equal to one,

00:03:32.234 --> 00:03:34.407
when n is equal to one,
g of n is going to be,

00:03:34.407 --> 00:03:37.012
or g of one is going to be
the number of party favors

00:03:37.012 --> 00:03:40.005
Seo-Yun had before the first guest.

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.824
Well, before the first guest,
she had 50 party favors.

00:03:44.428 --> 00:03:45.775
She had 50 party favors.

00:03:46.317 --> 00:03:48.740
Now, the second guest comes.

00:03:48.755 --> 00:03:50.584
Now the number of party
favors she had before

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.444
the second guest, well,
she had to give three

00:03:54.444 --> 00:03:56.313
to the first guest, so she's now

00:03:56.313 --> 00:03:58.676
going to have 47 party favors.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.824
Now, when n is equal to three,

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:02.429
how many party favors did she have

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:04.568
before the third guest?

00:04:04.928 --> 00:04:06.390
Well, she would've had
to give party favors

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.835
to the first and second
guest, who each got three.

00:04:09.194 --> 00:04:13.486
So, she would have 44, and
I think you see the pattern.

00:04:13.928 --> 00:04:17.022
For every time n, when n
equals one, g of n is 50,

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.596
and every time we increase n by one,

00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:23.497
every time we increment
n, we are increasing

00:04:23.497 --> 00:04:28.237
g of n by plus three, by
minus three, I should say

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:30.838
because she's giving away
party favors, minus three.

00:04:31.665 --> 00:04:32.646
Minus three.

00:04:33.006 --> 00:04:35.058
So because the difference
between successive terms

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:37.460
is the same, we know this
is an arithmetic sequence.

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:40.034
This is an arithmetic
sequence and then they say

00:04:40.034 --> 00:04:42.499
write an explicit
formula for the sequence.

00:04:43.055 --> 00:04:44.680
So let's think about this.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.242
Let's see, g of n is
going to be equal to...

00:04:48.256 --> 00:04:49.949
Let's see, we're going to start at 50

00:04:50.207 --> 00:04:53.590
then we're going to subtract
three, and let's think,

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.787
do we subtract three times n or is it...?

00:04:57.492 --> 00:04:59.503
Let's see, for the first guest,

00:04:59.503 --> 00:05:01.318
we subtract three zero times.

00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.406
For the second guest,
we subtract three once.

00:05:04.928 --> 00:05:07.941
For the third guest, we
subtract three twice.

00:05:08.463 --> 00:05:11.125
So, for the nth guest, we're
going to subtract three

00:05:11.125 --> 00:05:13.081
n minus one time.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.966
Notice, for the nth guest,
we subtracted three twice.

00:05:16.203 --> 00:05:19.237
The second guest, subtracted three once.

00:05:19.495 --> 00:05:21.573
First guest, subtracted three zero times,

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:22.590
so this works out.

00:05:22.888 --> 00:05:25.576
For the first guest, we would
subtract three zero times,

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:27.405
and so g of one would be 50.

00:05:27.663 --> 00:05:29.782
We can see that this is
consistent for all of these.

00:05:30.101 --> 00:05:34.372
So I could write 50 minus
three times n minus one,

00:05:34.408 --> 00:05:35.871
and I really recommend
making the table here

00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:37.740
just so you make sure
you get the n minus one

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.915
or the n right and it all gels.
