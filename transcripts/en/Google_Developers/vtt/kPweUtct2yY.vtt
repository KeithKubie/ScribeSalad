PAIGE BAILEY: Thanks to
an incredible and diverse

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.670
community, TensorFlow
has grown to become

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.010
one of the most loved
and widely adopted

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.200
machine learning
platforms in the world.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.780
This community
includes researchers

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.840
who use TensorFlow to do
things like forecast earthquake

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.930
aftershocks and
detect breast cancer,

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.350
developers who are using it
to identify disease plants

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.290
into perfect yoga
poses, companies

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.690
who are using TensorFlow
to improve their customer

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.270
experience, and of
course, all of you.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.200
We're so excited to have you
as part of our community.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.050
TensorFlow recently
celebrated its third birthday,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.240
with a look back at the features
added through the years.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.380
We're excited about another
major milestone, TensorFlow

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.400
2.0.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.100
TensorFlow 2.0 will
focus on simplicity

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.670
and ease of use, featuring
updates like easy model

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.360
building with Keras and
Eager execution, robust model

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.570
deployment, and production
on any platform,

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.480
powerful experimentation
for research,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.060
and simplifying the
API by cleaning up

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.140
deprecated endpoints and
reducing duplication.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.350
We're very excited about
TensorFlow 2.0 and the changes

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.010
to come.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.440
TensorFlow has grown
from a software library

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.410
for deep learning to
an entire ecosystem

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.480
for all kinds of
machine learning

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.810
from complex neural networks
to traditional methods

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.630
to AI on mobile and
embedded devices.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.900
TensorFlow 2.0 will be
simple and easy to use

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.530
for all users of any experience
level on all platforms.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.930
So why wait?

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.750
Try out the nightly
build of TF 2.0 today.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.229
We're excited to
see what you create.
