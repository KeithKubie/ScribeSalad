00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's put your newfound
knowledge to the test.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.150
For this question I want you to make
some updates to the Hometown Project.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.210
If you need the starter files,
check out the instructor notes for

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.200
instructions on downloading that.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.520
Here we can see what it
looks like right now.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.320
We've got two columns, text and

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.750
images, and we've got the weather and
sports scores.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.110
When we resize the page,

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.270
it's pretty clear that the content
is no longer fitting the browser.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.140
Let's go ahead and make it responsive.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.330
First, add a meta view port to the page,
and

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.460
don't forget to set the initial scale.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.790
Then I want you to make any
adjustments to the CSS in markup, so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.080
that everything displays
in a single column.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.970
Be sure to use relative widths, so

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.190
that things stretch to fit
across any viewport width.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.570
And then finally,
check your touch targets and

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.100
make sure that they're big enough.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.890
Once you've made your changes, test
your site across different viewports.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.880
Try it on phones, tablet's,
and different desktops.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.660
And when you're done,
here's what it should look like.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.290
Notice, to start off with,
everything's in one column.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.650
And when I resize the page, the content
reflows to fit the new viewport.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.710
And of course, my buttons are nice and
big and easy to press.
