[BACKGROUND SOUNDS OF ASTRONAUTS
AND MISSION CONTROL THROUGHOUT]

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.960
Astronaut Dan Tani is going to
talk us through what is possibly

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.480
the most dangerous thing
that any astronaut ever has to do.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.240
Dan why are they having to do
this spacewalk, this wasn't expected,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.860
this wasn't in the plans for Tim.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.380
He wasn't expecting
to get up on the space station

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.900
and almost immediately have to help
supervise a spacewalk.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.660
– Absolutely, they were doing
a routine move of what's called

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.680
the mobile transporter, and the
mobile transporter is like this trolley

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.080
that goes back and forth

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.616
– Yeah we can see it here can't we?

00:00:35.616 --> 00:00:38.420
–Yeah let's talk about that,
and so they were doing a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.110
routine maneuver from one work state to
another and unexpectedly it got stuck.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.430
It had to release from one more site and it
got stuck between before it could get

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.740
to the other work site,
and they don't know why.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.320
– And that's a big deal because they
depend very heavily on that arm?

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.140
– It's a very big deal because
two of the supply ships

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.600
that bring cargo to the space station,
the food and the experiments

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.320
and sometimes oxygen and critical things
are grappled by that arm,

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.320
and right now that arm is completely useless,
it's not hooked up to the space station

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.040
and so they need to get that arm,
the mobile transporter, locked into place,

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.960
so that the arm can be operated.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.120
– They're going out the lock there

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.200
– Yep, there they go, yeah.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.040
If they are unsuccessful at performing this EVA [extravehicular activity],

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.520
it will put a halt to everything
on the space station,

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520
they have got to fix this mobile transporter,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.340
they cannot continue operating the space station

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.020
with the mobile transporter in this position.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.800
This is a helmet camera,
you can see their perspective

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.820
of what they're doing.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.900
[ASTRONAUT COMMS SOUNDS]

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.380
– So they're navigating their way
to their destination,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.860
and that's what they're doing
now right, hand over hand,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.620
working their way around this structure, out of that air lock,

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.760
and out towards the seater car,
this transporter we've been hearing about.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.000
–Right. The space station is so large,
there are there are labels out here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.130
with arrows that say 'airlock', so that
we know how to get home.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.740
We'll see those, because the last thing
 you want is to be so disoriented

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.110
like I'm not sure where I'm going,
and so we have basically

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.800
how to get home arrows out there.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.310
– Is it easy to get lost on the
outside of the space station?

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.950
– It's very surprisingly easy to
lose your orientation and not be sure

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.069
am I on top, am I on bottom, 
am I behind

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.280
especially if it's dark and all you see
are a couple handrails.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.620
– Right, and that's a good point to make 
because right now they're in sunlight,

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.220
So they time the walk to start
with an ISS sunrise

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.960
and then they've got 45 minutes
before the Sun goes down again

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.930
and then this view will go dark
and only be illuminated by their helmet lights

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.060
– Helmet lights, yeah there are a few
external lights on the space station yes.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.200
– Let's have a listen to the down link...

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.920
[DOWNLINK]
–... Brake pedal on the starboard seater cart

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.840
will initiate the release of the
brake handle which is believed on the

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.260
starboard this is a guard to be the
suspect that is preventing the movement

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.720
of the mobile transporter...

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.000
[ASTRONAUT COMMS]

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.900
[KEVIN]
– So they are at their destination now?

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.820
[DAN]
– They're there yep, they're working it.
What they want to do is make sure

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.800
that the brake is the problem,
and there is no other problem.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.140
[ASTRONAUT COMMS]
I've got a lead on the nadir

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.670
stanchion that's the port on the lap.
– Okay copy that then you can go ahead and

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.040
translate it up to face one and you're
looking for handrail 35:23 which is in

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.420
bays 0 to 4 your green hook.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.280
[KEVIN]
– So some very specific instructions 
there so just not the handrail,

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.760
a numbered handrail,
 and telling him where he's gonna find it,

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.440
and how useful is that information
to you when you're walking?

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.519
-Oh it's real it's critical what they're
instructing him to do is go to that

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.220
handrail and take his safety tether and
attach it to that handrail because in

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.549
the whole choreography they don't want
to cross their tethers or I'll get it

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:58.220
caught up in anything else.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.440
– So right now, what Tim Peake
is still in vehicle,

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.080
I guess he's probably monitoring
their progress?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.980
– Oh yeah he's certainly monitoring
what's going on,

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.639
making sure that he understands
where everybody is but he has to be

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:12.150
acutely aware of what's happening on the
outside so that if anything happens he's

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.420
ready to jump into action and receive
them in the airlock again.

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.220
– And it sounds like that they might just
be about to get this cart moving?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.010
–Done everything they've needed to do
in the cedar cart and it sounds like they're

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.340
given the go and getting out of the way...

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.490
– So they're gonna get out the way

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.430
so that Mission Control can move
that car automatically from the ground

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.980
so there's an instruction is
gonna be issued from Mission Control and

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.000
get that cart moving and we're gonna see
in the next couple of minutes.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.280
[ASTRONAUT COMMS]
– Okay I'm ready for motion
whenever Tim and you guys are.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.780
– And I'm ready for motion too.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.880
–Okay we're putting in the last command

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.520
– I see motion.

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.380
– Yes we do see motion on the mobile transporter.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.080
– I see motion down here
as well that's good.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.540
[KEVIN]
It's inching towards its destination very slowly.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.380
[ASTRONAUT COMMS]
OK guys, good news,

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.820
it appears to have reached the worksite
center so we are a go to continue.

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.020
[DAN] 
It's a big success, they couldn't be happier with how things went on the space walk.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.880
[ASTRONAUT COMMS]

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.120
That's taking a picture of Tim Kopra,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.630
that's what he's doing he's told him who
he said he saw a good picture

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:25.800
so he's  setting up a picture.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.160
– Alright so enough time for selfies?

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.660
– Yes, yeah

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.880
– I think they're doing pretty well
oh that is remarkable so the crews have

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.740
gone out the airlock, they've got on to
that bit of the space station that was

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.680
broken, they have got that break off,
moved into place, tiny fingers crossed

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.160
to make sure that that couples into the
power so they can move it again,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.860
but I think that they have literally
saved this mission,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.220
I think that's a round of applause for them.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.200
– I believe they have

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:55.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.700
