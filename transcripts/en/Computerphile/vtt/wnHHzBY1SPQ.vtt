00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
Ada --  Ada Byron as she initially was; Ada
Lovelace as she became. What was so

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.330
special about her in terms of her
education, her genealogy if you like,

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.000
her genetics? What was so special about her
that enabled her to do what she did?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.949
Well, this is not strictly computer
science but it's a good story and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.310
it does have some marginal relevance to
all of this.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:37.170
Ada's parents were George Gordon Byron
- he was born in 1788. I'll put the first

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.149
name of his wife in quotes. Actually she 
was christened, I think as

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.770
Anne Isabella, but she actually liked to
run the two together and elide them

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.329
into "Annabella". So that's why I put quotes
around "Annabella Milbanke". They got

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.879
married in 1815 and you can work it out:
I mean ... that would mean that Byron was 27;

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.810
she was actually 23. And very shortly
after getting married they had a

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.960
daughter and Byron chose the name Ada
for her. You know, short; to the point;

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.860
poetical. Ada Byron born 10th December 1815.
She was the only

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.020
legitimate daughter of these two. Now, I
can only apologize again and say I have

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.869
to say something about, particularly, her father 
because it explains so much about Ada and how

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.619
she was educated the way she was.
Lord Byron was unbelievable. He was the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.530
[pre-] Victorian bad boy, par excellence. George
Gordon Byron was like an amalgam of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:50.490
Hunter S. Thompson, y' know, Sean Penn,
Charlie Sheen, Keith Richards maybe,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.570
all of the bad boys. And had there been a gang,
of them, a ratpack, he would have been the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.880
leader, most definitely.
Indeed, one of his many, many

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.219
girlfriends, for George Byron, was a lady
called Lady Caroline Lamb. Some of the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.810
oldies of my audience will have seen
the movie, starring Sarah Miles.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.480
And famously Lady Caroline Lamb
characterized him as being: Mad, Bad and

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.290
Dangerous to Know. 
[movie clip]  &gt;&gt; William Lamb - later Lord Melbourne:
He [Byron] writes like a housemaid on the 
verge of the vapours !

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.980
&gt;&gt; Lady Caroline: He does not mean to write like 
Alexander Pope ....
&gt;&gt; DFB: Lord Byron was famous at Cambridge for keeping a pet

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.230
bear in his rooms and when he'd later
declared himself to be a poet, and he was

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.950
a very good one, he went off to Italy to 
see his

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.140
poetical friends - and have them visit him.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.030
People like Shelley and Keats and stuff like
that. Shelley recounts that when he found

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.340
Byron by the sea, in lodgings, the
staircase was occupied by six pet

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.980
peacocks. It was this kind of excess - it
was sex drugs and rock'n'roll. Except

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.750
no rock'n'roll in those days - so it was sex
drugs and poetry 
&gt;&gt; Sean: If he'd had a Rolls-Royce

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.310
it would have been in the swimming pool?
&gt;&gt; DFB:  Oh!  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.010
Because he was like that. And because he left his
wife immediately - five weeks after Ada

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.170
was born - and they'd only been married
earlier that year, that Annabella Milbanke

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.880
thought he was the devil incarnate - had
no time for him - and was worried stiff

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.570
that daughter Ada might grow up in the
image of her father. So, to try and head

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.180
off trouble at the pass, it was decreed
that Ada's education could cover things

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:37.769
like non-fiction English literature, geography,
botany, mathematics, physics

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:43.440
chemistry - nothing that involved the
emotions. The thing that was absolutely

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.109
banned in her education was poetry.  That
inflamed the passions! She might start

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.519
taking after her father and then heaven
knows what would happen. So Ada,

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:01.560
unusually for a woman of [good] breeding in
early Victorian era, had a very rational

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.190
scientific upbringing. She had
mathematics tutors and, later on, actually

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.040
in wanting to become an even better
mathematician she did ask ... well she

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.209
not only took up with Babbage as we
will find out, but she also asked for

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.049
recommendations for other tutors. And one
of them is a person I think I have

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.699
mentioned on Computerphile already: Augustus
De Morgan, who came up with the

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.159
rules of the logical algebra, later known
as Boolean algebra. So, she had De Morgan

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:36.810
of De Morgan's Rules fame, as one of
her Maths tutors. And she was serious about

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.629
becoming ever more devoted to
mathematics. Think about it: 1815 she was

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:48.210
a society lady; she lived with her mother
and a large proportion of living with her

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:56.009
Mum, during the year, would be in London
in rented lodgings. Her mother was

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:00.270
reasonably well-off. She was a minor-league
sort of heiress in her own right. They

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.460
could afford that OK.
But young ladies of [good] breeding - really

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:13.080
up until about 1970, in the
society circuit, had a ceremony

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.259
almost of what was called 'coming out'. What
it meant was you were a 'debutante', you

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:23.940
were a young lady in society who hadn't
been formally introduced to the people who

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:28.650
mattered in Society. So you had 'coming
out balls', in fashionable London, and

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:34.349
these were attended by the Queen 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:41.430
or the King. When you add 17 onto 1815 [when Ada 
was born] - 1832 was Ada's Coming-Out Ball, where

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.930
she met the predecessor to Queen Victoria
who was King William IV, I think, at that time.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.990
But anyway, as part of this 'coming out'
she met, at one of the events, a certain

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.129
Charles Babbage and Charles Babbage
invited Ada and her mother,

00:05:56.129 --> 00:06:01.169
Annabella, to come and visit him at his
house, meet his wife, and to be shown this

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.129
miracle of mechanical engineering and
mathematics. "Only part-constructed  but

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:08.909
we're just awaiting more funds". Difference
Engine Mk II. And Ada was completely

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.830
captivated by this.  She thought it was
wonderful and she and Babbage became, shall

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.379
we say, "firm friends", corresponding very
very regularly. They kept in touch. But in

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:23.190
order to explain how it all came down, in
the end, to this Analytical Engine it goes

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:29.520
roughly as follows. In the early 1830s,
aged still only 19, she corresponded

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:32.750
a lot with Babbage about his Difference 
Engine MK II,

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:39.560
asks for recommendations for Maths tutors
and so on. [The] late 1830s were occupied by the

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:45.410
fact that. in about 1835 I think,
Ada met another gentleman from high

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.970
society called William King. Married him. They
fell for each other; whirlwind romance;

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:55.610
mid-1830s. So the late 1830s
as you can imagine was

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:00.590
spent on William King's Somerset estates
in the process of being domestic and

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.690
having three children. And fortunately
for Ada - very unusual in the Victorian

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:10.670
era - they did all survive and she herself
did not die in childbirth - a minor miracle

00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:15.710
in those days. But by early 1840s
she'd had her three children - of

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:18.860
course they were well enough off that they'd
be looked after by governesses, nursemaids

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:25.640
and so on - she decided that she would
like to get back into mathematics. And it

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:30.410
was at this late stage that Babbage,
without actually formally publishing it

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:37.250
anywhere, had come up with the idea of
the Analytical Engine.
[video clip] ...  keep it in the CPU, or if ...

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:43.250
&gt;&gt; DFB: Babbage, of course, would
have been the first programmer, in a

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:47.330
sense, of his Analytical Engine. He'd have
come up with the design and he'd have done

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:51.530
pencil and paper exercises about " ... with that
design will this actually work?". But don't

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:58.490
forget the Analytical Engine was not
built, has not been built and will cause

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:05.210
huge problems in being built.
However, the spec. could be obtained and

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:12.230
it was very, very impressive indeed.
So, why didn't Babbage publicize this

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.200
more? Why did Ada and others have to find

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.270
out almost by knowing him personally?
The answer is that Babbage was thin-skinned

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:25.250
- think back to my story in early videos
about Newton and Gauss. They were thin-skinned,

00:08:25.250 --> 00:08:29.930
couldn't stand criticism, couldn't stand the
unwashed criticising their

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:37.130
great thoughts. 
[video clip: Undecidability tangent]
&gt;&gt; DFB: But like Newton-- he
hated publishing. If you published then

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:41.120
the great unwashed would start telling ....
[end of clip]
&gt;&gt; DFB: The Boeotians I think it was called by

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.010
Gauss. Same thing with Babbage he was so
thin-skinned he could not take

00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:50.779
criticism and worst of all he stopped
giving lectures, because people

00:08:50.779 --> 00:08:56.899
misunderstood them and, worse still, he got
heckled! So, it was no use asking Babbage

00:08:56.899 --> 00:09:00.980
to give a lecture to the Royal
Institution, or something, in London about

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:06.170
his Analytical Engine - he was not going to do
that! However, he was invited to go to

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:10.010
Italy and I think he was probably a
member of the Italian equivalent of the

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:14.330
Royal Society. So we went over, by
invitation, in the late 1830s [correction: 1841]

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:19.760
to give a talk on his Analytical Engine.
A person there called Luigi Menabrea, an

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.149
engineer with a good maths background, who
later became Italian Prime Minister

00:09:23.149 --> 00:09:29.750
actually, took copious notes and wrote up a
paper, published in a French journal - not

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:35.900
an Italian one, amazingly. Well, Ada got
to hear about this, got hold of a copy of

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:42.020
it and decided that she could rework it
as translator, add a lot to it, do it

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.430
better and explain it to an English
audience. So, this is where the whole

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:50.480
issue comes of Ada as computer programmer.

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:57.980
Yes she really, really DID understand
every nuance of Babbage's design; she had

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:02.690
to in explaining how this program worked.
In, no doubt, writing programs of her

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:08.810
own. And I think what always impresses me
about Ada, when you read her copious notes at

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:16.459
the end of this paper ... beware it's in
Victorian English. It is heavy going! She

00:10:16.459 --> 00:10:21.589
and Babbage and the rest of the Victorians
would never use 6 words where 36 would do.

00:10:21.589 --> 00:10:26.390
All sorts of subjunctive clauses - oh! it's
hard work.

00:10:26.390 --> 00:10:32.089
Be warned! So anyway, in part of her end-notes
in this she lets her

00:10:32.089 --> 00:10:39.350
imagination run free and she says to
people: "Have you thought? Could

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:44.299
this wonderful Engine of Babbage's
compose music?" Now that really is good lateral

00:10:44.299 --> 00:10:49.369
thinking, because Sean and I have stood
there at Bletchley Park or sat there in

00:10:49.369 --> 00:10:52.669
front of my computer, here at Nottingham,
when we were doing the Ackermann

00:10:52.669 --> 00:10:57.799
function, and jokingly said to ourselves
"Ooh! it's thinking!"  when the result didn't

00:10:57.799 --> 00:11:01.999
come out. And, somehow, that's not too
difficult a thought to have when the

00:11:01.999 --> 00:11:08.059
thing is electronic and humming away. But
to have the thought of this crashing great

00:11:08.059 --> 00:11:13.039
Analytical Engine being driven by steam,
going bang! crash! bang! bang!. To think of

00:11:13.039 --> 00:11:18.739
that as a thinking machine does require a bigger 
leap of imagination. So yes,

00:11:18.739 --> 00:11:22.609
she had glimpses of the future, there's no
question about it.

00:11:22.609 --> 00:11:27.139
she really did.  
&gt;&gt; Sean: Even more so if you think that 
it's actually just on paper at this stage ...

00:11:27.139 --> 00:11:31.039
&gt;&gt; DFB: Oh yes!
&gt;&gt; Sean: ... she's seen some cogs from other 
things he's done but ...

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:35.479
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yes, later on, after her sort of tragic
death, Babbage when he wrote his own

00:11:35.479 --> 00:11:40.699
autobiography referred back constantly
to what he called his 'Enchantress of Number'

00:11:40.699 --> 00:11:46.069
i.e. Ada herself. And this wonderful paper.

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:50.899
Oh!! and another lovely Babbage story - I love
this one! She consulted with him while she was

00:11:50.899 --> 00:11:54.409
writing this paper and he thought it was
wonderful but came up with the great idea,

00:11:54.409 --> 00:11:58.789
which you can guess!
"Wouldn't it be a good idea, my dear, if as

00:11:58.789 --> 00:12:04.519
well as this paper I were to write an
anonymous preface to it and flame the

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:10.759
establishment and the grant-givers for not
giving me enough money to actually build it ?!"

00:12:10.759 --> 00:12:15.979
And she knew him well enough by this time;  she
adroitly avoided doing that.  I mean

00:12:15.979 --> 00:12:19.819
Babbage's idea that so long as it was
anonymous nobody would guess who wrote

00:12:19.819 --> 00:12:23.809
it, is just unbelievable.
Anyway that's how it all ended because

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:28.849
the trouble was - and the really tragic
thing for Ada was, as the 1840s wore on -

00:12:28.849 --> 00:12:34.489
her health got worse and worse and worse.
It's now believed that she actually died

00:12:34.489 --> 00:12:37.909
of cervical cancer. I think she didn't 
actually die until 1852.

00:12:37.909 --> 00:12:44.959
By that time her mother had moved
in with her and her husband, William King

00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:52.170
Earl of Lovelace, on their Somerset estate.
But a week or two before Ada died

00:12:52.170 --> 00:12:59.160
ructions began all over again because
she called William King her husband,

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.209
apparently, according to Stephen Wolfram's
blog - and i believe this, he's

00:13:03.209 --> 00:13:10.380
researched it well - and told William King
something that made him " ...very, very upset".

00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:15.600
It has not been recorded what it is. She
insisted that when she died - and she knew

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:20.130
death was inevitable - that she did not
want to be buried on the William King,

00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:25.170
Earl of Lovelace, estate in Somerset. She
wanted to be buried next to her father.

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:30.899
And this, if you like, is where the local
bit comes in, for us here in

00:13:30.899 --> 00:13:37.320
Nottingham. Her father George Gordon, Lord
Byron, when he wasn't being Mad, Bad and

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.570
Dangerous to Know, had also actually
inherited from a very distant Byron

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:49.920
cousin [correction: great-uncle] the whole 
of the Newstead Abbey estate. Now Newstead 
Abbey is a stately home just

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:56.850
north of us here [in Nottingham] . Byron loved 
inheriting this! Lord of the Manor; striding 
around; sword in

00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:01.110
hand, y' know, order the workers what 
to do next ...

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:08.579
Be a man with a country estate and with 
all my learning and my [good] breeding as well.

00:14:08.579 --> 00:14:11.310
Only trouble was - the fact is he was

00:14:11.310 --> 00:14:16.620
virtually bankrupt. He couldn't remotely afford
to run the Newstead estate. What little

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:23.339
money Byron had was spent on sex, drugs 
peacocks and poetry. So it

00:14:23.339 --> 00:14:27.240
never really got off the ground. And I
think fairly shortly thereafter maybe

00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:31.620
even before Byron died in 
1828 [correction: 1824] the
estate was sold and left the Byron

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:38.160
family completely. But Newstead Abbey was
there and it brought with it, of course, the

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:41.550
rights of the family grave.
Byron himself was buried in Hucknall

00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:46.589
Parish Church and Ada said - and upset her
husband and her Mum mightily - "I want to be buried

00:14:46.589 --> 00:14:51.720
next to my father in Hucknall Parish Church".
Fortunately due to our friends and

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.579
colleagues in Physics and "Sixty Symbols",
we're able to refer across because they

00:14:56.579 --> 00:15:01.570
paid a visit [in 2015] to Ada and her father's 
tomb in Hucknall Parish Church and have done a

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:06.160
video on it. 
[video clip] &gt;&gt; Prof. Merrifield: ... and up there 
on the wall is the plaque, commemorating Ada Lovelace,

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:10.149
vertical, she's not buried up there.
She's down here, in the family vault, or

00:15:10.149 --> 00:15:13.750
actually this is just the entrance to
the family vault .... 
&gt;&gt; DFB: At the funeral -

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:20.740
again it was a small affair - but really
telling was her mother did not attend, I

00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:26.410
think probably furious at her daughter's
wish to be buried next to the hated

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:33.250
husband, Lord Byron. Babbage was appointed
executor of Ada's will, but he didn't

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:39.399
attend either. Read into that what you
will but I think one can certainly say

00:15:39.399 --> 00:15:45.760
that in the past - in Ada's past - she was a
troubled soul in many ways - there were

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:52.240
probably "goings-on" of various sorts, that
we can only speculate about. And yet -

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.839
there's no doubt about it -
I don't want to under-play or over-play

00:15:58.839 --> 00:16:05.890
Ada but she was important.
She really was. She "got it", in a sense,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:11.920
about software - and what software could
do. And I think she sort of could

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.829
transcend the unbelievable limitations
of the hardware, that would have been

00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:21.760
limited, even had it ever been built. And
could see beyond that - she could see

00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:29.800
beyond that to a future of "computing for
its own sake" if you like. That local link

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.040
has been very important to us as part of
the bicentenary celebrations of Ada,

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.810
December 2015. Everybody labelled
everything "The Ada Lovelace Laboratory" or

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:45.760
"The Ada Lovelace Thing". Our excuse for
doing this - we've labelled our first-year lab

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.410
as: "The Ada Lovelace Computing Laboratory" is
that there is this local connection.

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:54.040
I don't know that she ever visited Newstead Abbey
[in fact she did visit Newstead - in 1850].
She probably lived in London

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.839
most of her life with her Mum.  And I bet you her 
mother, if there had been any talk

00:16:58.839 --> 00:17:03.160
of a trip to Newstead, would have vetoed
it, because it might have, y' know, taken

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.820
you too near to "That Man" or something like

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:13.370
that - but, yes, that is our local connection.
