00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.380
I'm Carole Kushnir. I'm from California and I'm

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.480
here representing being identified with the BRCA2 Mutation.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.790
&gt;&gt; tyk can you tell us a little bit more what,

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.860
what is the BRCA2 mutation you have and what does it mean?

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:25.870
&gt;&gt; Well I have the one mutation is. that was tested and reported is,

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.610
6 1 7 4 delT and it is a

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.880
pretty common mutation in Ashkenazi Jewish people. And an

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.100
uncle of mine is also, has the same mutation. And my cousin, his daughter.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.704
&gt;&gt; When did you find out you had the mutation?

00:00:44.704 --> 00:00:48.896
&gt;&gt; I found out in early 2010.

00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:49.508
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.508 --> 00:00:50.888
&gt;&gt; And, it was a surprise.

00:00:50.888 --> 00:00:56.075
I did the 23andMe, genetic testing and

00:00:56.075 --> 00:01:01.410
the results came back and it was. Surprising.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.140
&gt;&gt; And what did they tell you it means, what, like when you

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.630
have this mutation, what does it mean, what does, for you, for an individual.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.860
&gt;&gt; Well, the risk of breast cancer is increased compared to the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.560
general population, and the risk of ovarian cancer is increased. Did

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.550
you know what those increased risks were, what those percentages were?

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.962
&gt;&gt; Well, for the breast cancer risk it's

00:01:29.962 --> 00:01:36.100
between 20 and 50% risk. Although, I saw a higher number

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.070
earlier when I looked recently, it seems like the risk. The number I saw

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.700
changed, and for ovarian cancer, the risk is much

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.520
lower but the risk is higher than in the general population. And you can also

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.280
calculate the risk based on age. So compared to the general population.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.596
The risk for breast cancer at my age, at 70, is four,

00:02:06.596 --> 00:02:11.840
about 4.5 out of the 100 compared to about 2.5 out of 100 for another woman at

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.060
age 70 who does not have the BRCA mutation.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.220
&gt;&gt; I see. And what did you think about this whole. Sort

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.140
of probability issue, you know, the idea of a percentage I mean, I

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.520
think a lot of people think genetics is going to tell them. Oh, I

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.620
am or I'm not going to have this trait. What was running through

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.590
your mind?

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.095
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:37.200
[LAUGH].

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.250
I am married to a physicist who understands. Statistics. And

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.110
he must have explained this to me half a dozen times.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.110
&gt;&gt;

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.003
[LAUGH]

00:02:47.003 --> 00:02:49.703
&gt;&gt; And all I could focus on was the, the

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:53.520
high number. But, of course, as you get older the risk,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.945
it changes, it varies. Assuming that there are a hundred people.

00:03:00.945 --> 00:03:06.430
Uh,100 women with the BRCA mutation, and 50

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.730
already, 50 out of 100 have already had breast

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.760
cancer, then the statistics change. And I can't really explain

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.560
it but um,it is daunting to think that there is.

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.640
You know, double the risk of someone else my

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.480
age, even if it is a low number. However, if

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.830
you have the mutation there's, as far as I understand

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.783
it, there's, in my particular case I'm missing the T.

00:03:36.783 --> 00:03:37.954
[LAUGH].

00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:42.530
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. And, the whole

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.580
gene shifts. The BRCA gene is shifting and there is a

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:55.140
mutation. And so, it's not operating correctly is, is my best understanding.
