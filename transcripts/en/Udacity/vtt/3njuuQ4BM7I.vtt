00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.230
Fun fact.

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:02.580
James, did you know that,

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.689
in many parts of the world, names are capitalized differently?

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.130
While Americans capitalize the first letter of both names,

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.190
in many places of the world, the first name has the first letter capitalized,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.520
while the last name is entirely capitalized.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.100
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.050
I guess that does make sense.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.920
In some countries, I know that they list the family name first and

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.790
the first name second, and it probably makes sense if

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.980
our resumes could switch to international mode to do the same.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this sounds like an interesting challenge.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.409
First off, append the internationalized button to the main div.

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:36.010
This is just a string with HTML that will create a button.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.020
Then, create a function named inName() that takes a string of two names and

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.720
returns an internationalized version that would look something like this.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.500
When you're done, check this button.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.240
You should be able to see the new internationalized name show up on

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.120
the resume every time you click the button.
