00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.740
Tadashi: So here's a mirror of sorts, it's curved.

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:07.360
And in front of this mirror, I put this rectangular sheet (with something drawn on it).

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.140
And when you put it in front of the mirror

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.800
and look inside the mirror

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.280
you see a cat.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.480
You know, with pointy ears

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.720
and side protrusions that look like whiskers and everything.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.000
So, I am very happy with this cat.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.180
I'm proud of this cat.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.460
A nice cat, I will say.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.300
But when I show this to a mathematician

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.180
and theoretical physicist colleagues

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.720
Some people like this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.700
because they have good taste.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.560
But others say

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.680
So?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.020
Well, that's really sad.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.880
I hoped that they didn't say so.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.160
But for those of us who'd like to say so: here's the thing.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.420
In front, you have a mirror, indeed

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.380
but that's what we call a "convex mirror."

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.880
So it's bulging out towards us.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.860
In the back, inside of the tube

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.960
there is a concave mirror.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.580
Which is bulging away from us.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:51.860
So now, I'm going to put

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.020
another cat inside

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.180
and look at what happens.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.200
And if you look from the correct angle

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.800
you see another cat inside.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.200
By the way, some people might wonder

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.140
how many reflections are bouncing off before it reaches our eyes.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.760
But in fact it is just one reflection.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.560
It's reflecting on the back side and then coming out.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.140
So you have a cat on the inside.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.500
Now, the slightly odd thing is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.860
that cat on the inside

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.820
looks very much like the cat on the outside.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.780
Although the cat on the outside is from a convex mirror

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.840
whereas the cat on the inside is from a concave mirror.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.420
So convex and concave

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.600
I mean they are opposite things

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.300
and you might expect the distortion effects to be the opposite

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.000
but they look very very similar.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.140
So that's quite interesting.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.220
It's not much of a hint

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.560
but one thing that has to do with this effect is the following.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.620
This arrow

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.280
is pointing from left to right.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.060
And if you look at it's image reflection

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.980
in the mirror in front, the convex part

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.800
it's still pointing from left to right.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.920
But let's look at it on the inside on the concave mirror.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.620
It's pointing from right to left!

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.000
So that's quite interesting

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
it reversed it's direction.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.420
So, it's a matter of

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.060
where the center of focus you are placing the arrow.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.940
As I move the arrow inside, or according to the outside, move the mirror

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.840
you see the arrow changing it's shape

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.120
and

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.460
somehow it sort of blurs out

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.400
and eventually at the end

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.040
you come to the point where you see the real image next to the original arrow.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.960
So you can do something like this

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.340
with a cylindrical mirror

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.380
and little rectangular sheets of paper.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.760
When I first thought of this

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.400
you know I thought something like this might be interesting to try.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.280
The major problem I faced was

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.900
where do you find a cylindrical mirror?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.880
I mean, if you have

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.180
a flat mirror

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.960
you know, slightly bulging out or bulging in

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.260
so it changes the size of your image

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.420
and so in a way, you can find that in cosmetic shops

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.200
and so forth.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.800
But

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.620
where do you find a cylindrical mirror?

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:51.420
A tube-like mirror?

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.420
And I thought and I thought

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.160
and finally

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.580
I went to the shopping center and I found one!

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.820
These are cookie cutters!

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:59.600
It's a cookie cutter, you know, where you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.520
make the cookie dough and then cut the shapes.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.880
So you can buy 1 for $1.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.540
And, with that

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.340
you can make a cat in the mirror!

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.960
Brady: A cat in the cookie cutter?

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.500
Tadashi: That's right!
