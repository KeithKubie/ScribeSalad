the world are linked and if so if they

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170
the world are linked and if so if they
 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.189
the world are linked and if so if they
manifest differently in men and women

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:27.199
manifest differently in men and women
 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.200
manifest differently in men and women
and if they kind of come from the same

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210
and if they kind of come from the same
 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.690
and if they kind of come from the same
era I think they are linked but I'm

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700
era I think they are linked but I'm
 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.979

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850
second part of your question so I'm
 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639

mine the other day he's a very very
 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.639
mine the other day he's a very very
smart guy and we've been talking about

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649
smart guy and we've been talking about
 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:44.750
smart guy and we've been talking about
all all the sorts of things that we've

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760
all all the sorts of things that we've
 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.100
all all the sorts of things that we've
been talking about tonight for a long

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110
been talking about tonight for a long
 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139
been talking about tonight for a long
time and we were talking about the

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
time and we were talking about the
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540
time and we were talking about the
relatively relative evolutionary roles

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550
relatively relative evolutionary roles
 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.369
relatively relative evolutionary roles
of men and women this is speculative

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379
of men and women this is speculative
 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.549
of men and women this is speculative
obviously and and because our research

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
obviously and and because our research
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.500
obviously and and because our research
did indicate its tentative research so

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
did indicate its tentative research so
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.760

philosophy is more prevalent among women

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830
philosophy is more prevalent among women
 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.530
philosophy is more prevalent among women
well it's predicted by the personality

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
well it's predicted by the personality
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.780
well it's predicted by the personality
factors that are more common among women

factors that are more common among women
so agreeable this and high negative

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
so agreeable this and high negative
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.090
so agreeable this and high negative
emotion primarily agreeableness but in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100
emotion primarily agreeableness but in

addition it's also predicted by being

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110
addition it's also predicted by being
 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410
addition it's also predicted by being
female and that's interesting because in

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420
female and that's interesting because in
 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.940
female and that's interesting because in
most of the personality research that

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950
most of the personality research that
 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.649
most of the personality research that
I've done and as far as I know in the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659
I've done and as far as I know in the
 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.980
I've done and as far as I know in the
literature at you know in more broadly

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990
literature at you know in more broadly
 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.020
literature at you know in more broadly
speaking most of the time you can get

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
speaking most of the time you can get
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850
speaking most of the time you can get
rid of the attitudinal differences

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860
rid of the attitudinal differences
 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620
rid of the attitudinal differences
between men and women or at least reduce

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630
between men and women or at least reduce
 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.600
between men and women or at least reduce
them by controlling for personality so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610
them by controlling for personality so
 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.950
them by controlling for personality so
if you take a feminine man and a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
if you take a feminine man and a
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.980
if you take a feminine man and a
masculine woman then you know that the

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
masculine woman then you know that the
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.010
masculine woman then you know that the
polls reverse but that didn't seem to be

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
polls reverse but that didn't seem to be
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.600
polls reverse but that didn't seem to be
the case with political correctness and

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
the case with political correctness and
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.310
the case with political correctness and
so I've been thinking about that a lot

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320
so I've been thinking about that a lot
 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.219
so I've been thinking about that a lot
because well men are bailing out of the

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229
because well men are bailing out of the
 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.590
because well men are bailing out of the
humanities like mad and pretty much out

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600
humanities like mad and pretty much out
 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300
humanities like mad and pretty much out
of the universities except for stem the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
of the universities except for stem the
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.550
of the universities except for stem the
women are moving in like mad and they're

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560
women are moving in like mad and they're
 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.410
women are moving in like mad and they're
also moving into the political sphere

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
also moving into the political sphere
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.209
also moving into the political sphere
like mad and this is new right we've

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219
like mad and this is new right we've
 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.980
like mad and this is new right we've
never had this happen before and we do

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
never had this happen before and we do
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.389
never had this happen before and we do
know know do not know what the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399
know know do not know what the
 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.340
know know do not know what the
significance of it is it's only 50 years

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350
significance of it is it's only 50 years
 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.679
significance of it is it's only 50 years
old and so we were thinking about this

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689
old and so we were thinking about this
 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.479
old and so we were thinking about this
and so I don't know what do you think

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
and so I don't know what do you think
 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.639
and so I don't know what do you think
about this proposition but imagine that

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649
about this proposition but imagine that
 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.890
about this proposition but imagine that
that that historically speaking

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
that that historically speaking
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.890
that that historically speaking
it's something like women were

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
it's something like women were
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.720
it's something like women were
responsible for distribution and men

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730
responsible for distribution and men
 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.539
responsible for distribution and men
were responsible for production

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549
were responsible for production
 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:22.160
were responsible for production
something like that and maybe maybe

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
something like that and maybe maybe
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.440
something like that and maybe maybe
that's only the case really in the tight

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450
that's only the case really in the tight
 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.270
that's only the case really in the tight
confines of the immediate family but

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280
confines of the immediate family but
 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.649
confines of the immediate family but
that doesn't matter because that's most

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659
that doesn't matter because that's most
 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.330
that doesn't matter because that's most
of the evolutionary landscape for human

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340
of the evolutionary landscape for human
 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.130
of the evolutionary landscape for human
beings anyways what the women does it

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
beings anyways what the women does it
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.869
beings anyways what the women does it
did was make sure that everybody got

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879
did was make sure that everybody got
 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:36.020
did was make sure that everybody got
enough okay and that seems to me to be

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030
enough okay and that seems to me to be
 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.970
enough okay and that seems to me to be
one of the things that's driving at

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980
one of the things that's driving at
 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.030
one of the things that's driving at
least in part the SJW demand for for

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040
least in part the SJW demand for for
 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.039
least in part the SJW demand for for
equity and equality it's like let's make

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049
equity and equality it's like let's make
 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.410
equity and equality it's like let's make
sure everybody has enough it's like both

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
sure everybody has enough it's like both
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.849
sure everybody has enough it's like both
look fair enough you know I mean you

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859
look fair enough you know I mean you
 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.680
look fair enough you know I mean you
can't you can't argue with that

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690
can't you can't argue with that
 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.559
can't you can't argue with that
but there's there's an intimacy between

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569
but there's there's an intimacy between
 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.530
but there's there's an intimacy between
that and the reality of differential

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540
that and the reality of differential
 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.089
that and the reality of differential
productivity you know because people

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099
productivity you know because people
 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.680
productivity you know because people
really do differ in their productivity

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690
really do differ in their productivity
 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.890
really do differ in their productivity
so alright so to answer your question

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900
so alright so to answer your question
 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.069
so alright so to answer your question
fully I do think that the rebellious

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079
fully I do think that the rebellious
 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.619
fully I do think that the rebellious
tendency of adolescents is associated

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:06.629
tendency of adolescents is associated
 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.210
tendency of adolescents is associated
both with that criminality spike

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
both with that criminality spike
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.979
both with that criminality spike
especially among men and with creativity

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989
especially among men and with creativity
 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.460
especially among men and with creativity
yes I think that the SJW phenomena is

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
yes I think that the SJW phenomena is
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.380
yes I think that the SJW phenomena is
different and I think it is associated

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390
different and I think it is associated
 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.030
different and I think it is associated
at least in part with the rise of women

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040
at least in part with the rise of women
 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.509
at least in part with the rise of women
to political power and and we don't know

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519
to political power and and we don't know
 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.280
to political power and and we don't know
what women are like when they have
