00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.410
Use less than, greater than or
equal to compare the two

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.560
fractions 21/28 and 6/9.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:10.920
Now, your impulse might just
be to look at these numbers

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.110
and say, oh, look, these are
larger numbers than those.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.120
This must be bigger.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.440
You cannot do that.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.300
And we'll talk about in future
videos on why that is, or I

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.780
encourage you to think about why
you cannot do that, but to

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.700
do it properly, at least in my
mind, the best way is to get

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.740
these both in simplified forms
and to just think about what

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.630
they represent.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.850
And in the future when we
learn to convert them to

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.680
decimals, that's actually the
best way to do it, or actually

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.810
for me, the easiest way.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:36.980
But let's try to do what
we can so far.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.310
So 21/28, we want to put this
in simplified form.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.500
21 is the same thing
as 3 times 7.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.710
28 is the same thing
as 4 times 7.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.640
They're both divisible by 7.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.460
Now, if you divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.270
by 7, 3 times 7 divided by
7 is just going to be 3.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.980
4 times 7 divided by 7 is
just going to be 4.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.140
So this guy right here is 3/4,
is equivalent to 3/4.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.490
Now, let's think about
what 6/9 is.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.840
Since these numbers are smaller,
this is actually a

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.710
good chance to visualize it.

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.010
So let's visualize if we have
ninths, let me draw the 9

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:34.120
ninths first. So if I were to
split it into thirds, I just

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.060
want to make it so
it's reasonably--

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.170
oh, that's not right.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.020
Maybe there and there, and then
divide each of these into

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.260
thirds, so just like that, a
little bit more space to that

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.630
one, and then we have it
like that, and then

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.990
this one into thirds.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.750
Let me draw it like that.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.900
So here we have 9 pieces of a
candy bar, whatever you want

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.740
to think about it, or 9/9.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:12.010
6/9 literally means one, two,
three, four, five six.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.160
6/9 references 6 of the 9
potential pieces, 6 of these

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.940
one-ninth of a candy bar piece,
however you want to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:20.830
think about it.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:28.920
Now, 6 is the same thing as 2
times 3, so you can view it as

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.290
two groups of 3.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.440
Let me do it this way.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.440
You can view it as
two groups of 3.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.970
So this is one group of 3.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.410
This is one group of 3 right
there, and that is another

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.170
group of 3.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.640
These are two groups of 3.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.370
Now, what is 9 equivalent to?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.250
9 is equivalent to 3 times
3, or three groups of 3.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.870
So 9 is equivalent to that's
one group of 3, that is two

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.760
groups of 3, and now this
is three groups of 3.

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.010
So we could redraw this as--
so if we just draw just the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.155
groups of 3, it would
look like this.

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.410
And these two groups of 3 that
the 6 represents, if we just

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.110
draw the groups of three, it
would be that guy and that the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.960
guy right over there.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:41.500
So how many thirds do we have,
if you consider each of those

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.760
groups of three as a third?

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.890
Well, we have 2/3.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.570
This is equivalent to 2/3.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.880
But doing the process that we're
used to doing, we could

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.790
imagine 6 is 2 times 3.

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.600
9 is 3 times 3.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.230
If you divide 2 times
3 by 3, you get 2.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.660
If you divide 3 times 3
by 3, you get the 3.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:12.870
So 6/9 is the same thing as 2/3,
two of the thirds, of the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:13.870
one-thirds.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.940
That's what 6/9 is
equivalent to.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.760
Now, let's think about
what's larger.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.640
2/3, which is the same
thing as 6/9, or 3/4?

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.350
I didn't do 21/28 because
it would've

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.730
taken forever to draw.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.990
So what does 3/4 look like?

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.110
What is 3/4?

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.610
So if we were to take this
exact same square-- so

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.040
let me redraw it.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.550
So if we were to take that same
exact candy bar, so these

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.070
should be the same size, instead
of cutting it up into

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.370
three pieces, if we were to cut
it up into four pieces,

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.030
what do we get?

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.920
So let's see, that's cutting
up into two pieces, and now

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.300
let me cut it up into
four pieces.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.900
So now this one has fourths,
this one has thirds.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.940
3 in the denominator here-- so
let me make it very clear.

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.540
This represents 2/3.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.500
Now, this is going to represent,
we have four

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.300
pieces, and if we're coloring in
three of them, so if we're

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.950
talking about 3/4, that's one--
let me draw it like

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.100
this, actually.

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:20.610
That is one, two-- let
me scroll up a

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.490
little bit-- three.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.990
This is three of the fourths.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.270
And the way I drew it, it is not
completely obvious to you.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.110
Actually, the way I drew it
because-- let me draw it a

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.360
little bit neater than this.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:34.870
Let me draw it a little bit
neater and it'll become a

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:35.830
little bit more obvious.

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.570
I didn't draw the fourths.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.050
Here, drawing neatly
actually matters.

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:44.070
So let me draw it like
that and then split

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.755
this group-- nope.

00:05:45.755 --> 00:05:50.870
I want to make it even, so I
want to make it like this.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.280
OK, so if those are the fourths,
if we're talking

00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:01.490
about three of the fourths,
we're talking about one, two,

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.060
three fourths, and you can see
that 3/4 is larger than 2/3.

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:10.750
2/3 gets us to this far of the
candy bar, while 3/4 is a

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.070
little bit more of
the candy bar.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.910
2/3 is about that far, 3/4
is even more, so 3/4

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:18.190
is larger than 2/3.

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:19.570
And we'll show you in the
future how to do it

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.010
numerically.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:22.890
You can use a calculator, if you
like, or you could do it

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:30.030
by hand, but you can see from
this visually that 3/4 is

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.620
greater than 2/3.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.810
Now, they want to compare
these two fractions.

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:39.080
So 21/28 is the same
thing as 3/4.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.200
So 21/28 is going to be greater
than 2/3, which is the

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.690
same thing as 6/9.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.110
And so we are done.
