00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:10.220
Being at Columbia really shaped the
trajectory of my own scholarship. I began

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.750
to produce works that were I would say
much more historical but kind of turned

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.820
my eye toward New York and toward Harlem
in my scholarship and I'm not sure that

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.269
that would have ever happened had I not
come here and had I not been working

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.580
with scholars who were also doing
innovative exciting things-- actually I

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.000
feel like they were producing fields, and
not just producing fields in producing

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.610
books, but finding young scholars like I
was at the time and encouraging us and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.860
nurturing us and providing a place where
we could do the work and that's what I'd

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.050
like to see this department continue to
do, I'd like for it to be a kind of

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.079
laboratory for young scholars who like I
had been to really do their best work

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.020
and perhaps find some strengths they
didn't even know they had
