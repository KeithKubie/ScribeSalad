Latin America how will this strength

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700
Latin America how will this strength
 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.549
Latin America how will this strength
growth and impact development latin

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
growth and impact development latin
 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.470
growth and impact development latin
america has abundance of natural

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480
america has abundance of natural
 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.340
america has abundance of natural
resources that the world needs and and

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
resources that the world needs and and
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.620
resources that the world needs and and
this can be triggered to develop the

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630
this can be triggered to develop the
 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750
this can be triggered to develop the
world needs minerals the world needs

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760
world needs minerals the world needs
 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.179
world needs minerals the world needs
food but Latin America needs to make

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189
food but Latin America needs to make
 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.460
food but Latin America needs to make
sure that it all it provides that to the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470
sure that it all it provides that to the
 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.479
sure that it all it provides that to the
world but it also adds value and adding

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489
world but it also adds value and adding
 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.180
world but it also adds value and adding
value the income of that Americans will

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190
value the income of that Americans will
 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.590
value the income of that Americans will
increase and the living standards will

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600
increase and the living standards will
 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.500
increase and the living standards will
increase so the main strength is that

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
increase so the main strength is that
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.139
increase so the main strength is that
the real the reason is very rich in what

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
the real the reason is very rich in what
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.580
the real the reason is very rich in what
the rest of the world is lacking and

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590
the rest of the world is lacking and
 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709
the rest of the world is lacking and
let's begin with one very important

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719
let's begin with one very important
 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.619
let's begin with one very important
component here which is biodiversity and

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629
component here which is biodiversity and
 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.580
component here which is biodiversity and
water these are abundant resources in

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590
water these are abundant resources in
 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.250
water these are abundant resources in
the region that we must preserve and we

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260
the region that we must preserve and we
 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.189
the region that we must preserve and we
must learn how to use well but in the

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199
must learn how to use well but in the
 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.979
must learn how to use well but in the
future this will be the region's

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
future this will be the region's
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.670
future this will be the region's
greatest strength in terms of world

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680
greatest strength in terms of world
 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.200
greatest strength in terms of world
competitiveness

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:17.060
final Latin America has one of the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070
final Latin America has one of the
 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.460
final Latin America has one of the
highest youth unemployment rates in the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470
highest youth unemployment rates in the
 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.500
highest youth unemployment rates in the
world how come Latin America increase

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510
world how come Latin America increase
 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.650
world how come Latin America increase
opportunities for young people well

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660
opportunities for young people well
 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.570
opportunities for young people well
Latin America does not provide enough

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580
Latin America does not provide enough
 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.160
Latin America does not provide enough
jobs to the youth so this is a major

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
jobs to the youth so this is a major
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.600
jobs to the youth so this is a major
problem and the reason for that is that

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:34.610
problem and the reason for that is that
 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:41.170
problem and the reason for that is that
the region has antiquated labor laws

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180
the region has antiquated labor laws
 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.270
the region has antiquated labor laws
that prevent employment that restrict

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280
that prevent employment that restrict

that prevent employment that restrict
employment and that push a lot of people

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990
employment and that push a lot of people
 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.680
employment and that push a lot of people
into informatika so the region has to

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690
into informatika so the region has to
 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.370
into informatika so the region has to
upgrade at labor legislation and put it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
upgrade at labor legislation and put it
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.820
upgrade at labor legislation and put it
in the in the context and the level that

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830
in the in the context and the level that
 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.550
in the in the context and the level that
some of the developed world has much

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
some of the developed world has much
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.870
some of the developed world has much
more flexibility but at the same time

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880
more flexibility but at the same time
 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.120
more flexibility but at the same time
protection to the worker but flexibility

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130
protection to the worker but flexibility
 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.960
protection to the worker but flexibility
in terms of the ability to hire reducing

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970
in terms of the ability to hire reducing
 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.540
in terms of the ability to hire reducing
the costs because the trend is not good

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550
the costs because the trend is not good
 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.240
the costs because the trend is not good
too much informatica too few yobs are

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
too much informatica too few yobs are
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030
too much informatica too few yobs are
being created for the youth of Latin

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040
