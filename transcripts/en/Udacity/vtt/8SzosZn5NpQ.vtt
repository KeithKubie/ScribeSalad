Now let's get into multiplying and
dividing integers.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.090
The result when numbers
are multiplied is called a product.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.890
So let's say I want to buy some gum
that comes in packs of five pieces.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.050
How many pieces of gum
are there in two packs?

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.106
So what is the product of five and two?

00:00:21.106 --> 00:00:23.614
Enter your answer here.

00:00:23.614 --> 00:00:25.639
