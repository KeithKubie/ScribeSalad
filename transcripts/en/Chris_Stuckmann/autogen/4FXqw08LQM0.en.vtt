the movie does feel a little bit strange
 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.230
the movie does feel a little bit strange
and cut up like certain things have been

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
and cut up like certain things have been
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.029
and cut up like certain things have been
placed that weren't there and now they

00:01:35.029 --> 00:01:35.039
placed that weren't there and now they
 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:37.100
placed that weren't there and now they
kind of shifted a few things around but

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110
kind of shifted a few things around but
 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.050
kind of shifted a few things around but
remarkably the movie actually holds up

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060
remarkably the movie actually holds up
 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.699
remarkably the movie actually holds up
fairly well and Brad Pitt is one of my

00:01:40.699 --> 00:01:40.709
fairly well and Brad Pitt is one of my
 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:41.930
fairly well and Brad Pitt is one of my
favorite actors and I think he did a

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940
favorite actors and I think he did a
 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.490
favorite actors and I think he did a
really good job in this movie portraying

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
really good job in this movie portraying
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.790
really good job in this movie portraying
the character as this stoic badass type

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800
the character as this stoic badass type
 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.320
the character as this stoic badass type
but at the same time he was protective

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330
but at the same time he was protective
 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.910
but at the same time he was protective
of his family when it needed to be and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920
of his family when it needed to be and
 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.469
of his family when it needed to be and
even though that is a very common

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479
even though that is a very common
 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.330
even though that is a very common
character I think that he did a good job

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340
character I think that he did a good job
 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.130
character I think that he did a good job
with it and you could kind of look

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
with it and you could kind of look
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.380
with it and you could kind of look
beyond the Brad Pitt thing because when

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390
beyond the Brad Pitt thing because when
 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.639
beyond the Brad Pitt thing because when
a star gets to a point where he's so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649
a star gets to a point where he's so
 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.410
a star gets to a point where he's so
famous it's difficult for him to portray

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
famous it's difficult for him to portray
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.150
famous it's difficult for him to portray
a character like Tom Cruise I know faces

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160
a character like Tom Cruise I know faces
 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.070
a character like Tom Cruise I know faces
that similar issue where he it's hard

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080
that similar issue where he it's hard
 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.839
that similar issue where he it's hard
not to see Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849
not to see Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt
 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.059
not to see Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt
sometimes it's hard not to see Brad Pitt

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
sometimes it's hard not to see Brad Pitt
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.320
sometimes it's hard not to see Brad Pitt
but I think Brad Pitt does a pretty good

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
but I think Brad Pitt does a pretty good
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.699
but I think Brad Pitt does a pretty good
job in this movie and he really has to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
job in this movie and he really has to
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.080
job in this movie and he really has to
hold up the whole movie because he is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090
hold up the whole movie because he is
 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.670
hold up the whole movie because he is
the star of the movie and he really is

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
the star of the movie and he really is
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.530
the star of the movie and he really is
the star of this movie I mean there were

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540
the star of this movie I mean there were
 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.820
the star of this movie I mean there were
supporting characters that drift in and

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830
supporting characters that drift in and
 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.619
supporting characters that drift in and
out of the scenes but Brad Pitt has his

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629
out of the scenes but Brad Pitt has his
 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.180
out of the scenes but Brad Pitt has his
whole movie on his shoulders it really

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190
whole movie on his shoulders it really
 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.650
whole movie on his shoulders it really
seems like it should have been rated our

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
seems like it should have been rated our
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.880
seems like it should have been rated our
movie because you can tell that a lot of

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890
movie because you can tell that a lot of
 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.680
movie because you can tell that a lot of
the more grotesque or intense moments

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690
the more grotesque or intense moments
 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.960
the more grotesque or intense moments
were blocked away by certain things or

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970
were blocked away by certain things or
 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.910
were blocked away by certain things or
hidden from camera and I don't really

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920
hidden from camera and I don't really
 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.050
hidden from camera and I don't really
have a problem with that I just feel

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060
have a problem with that I just feel
 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.309
have a problem with that I just feel
like this movie would have benefited

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319
like this movie would have benefited
 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.960
like this movie would have benefited
from an r-rating I think that they

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970
from an r-rating I think that they
 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.550
from an r-rating I think that they
improved the CGI quite a bit from that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560
improved the CGI quite a bit from that
 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.930
improved the CGI quite a bit from that
first initial trailer it'll just look

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940
first initial trailer it'll just look
 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.059
first initial trailer it'll just look
like cartoon really and in that way I

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069
like cartoon really and in that way I
 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.069
like cartoon really and in that way I
was very pleased because that first

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079
was very pleased because that first
 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.209
was very pleased because that first
trailer it really just looked like

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:41.219

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:41.930
trailer it really just looked like
cartoon

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940
cartoon
 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.670

zombies were coming after Brad Pitt and
 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.930
zombies were coming after Brad Pitt and
I'm glad they were able to fix that I

I'm glad they were able to fix that I
 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.250
I'm glad they were able to fix that I
can't really get into one of my main

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260
can't really get into one of my main
 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.630
can't really get into one of my main
issues with the film because it is a

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640
issues with the film because it is a
 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.700
issues with the film because it is a
major spoiler so I'll get my way around

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:49.710
major spoiler so I'll get my way around
 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.260
