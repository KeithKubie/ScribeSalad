00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:07.840
(Singing) I hate to see the evening sun go down

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.570
(Spoken) I had a dream I was dancing with the dead

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.000
We were swinging, with hollow voices, hollow bones,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.200
emptying our lungs of the cities we carried for decades.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.440
I knew they was dead cause they had memories, wrapped around the necks,

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.380
and the feet moved so fast they didn’t touch the floor.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.780
You see, at night this body allows the multitude
within it to awake,

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.340
for a rhapsody in blues.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.380
You see these legs, I got them from dance
and, I used to dance the belts off brothers

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.580
back in the day.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.460
People used to say, “Oh, she from the North!”
but we had dance.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.700
Don’t know which coast I came from, they
just assumed north, or “Oh, She from the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.700
Islands!”

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.110
I never had no island in me, but my mind was
in the islands each time I poured a bad boa

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.580
from these here hips, ask your mama.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.230
I remember the stirrings, that birthed the
movement.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.500
You see, swing was the physical account of
a people that weren’t being heard.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.330
Swing started way back in the Middle Passage
as we rocked between them waves, we were swinging.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.330
Swing was the response to the calls of jazz.

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.420
Swing, my people’s way of loosening nooses,
of dismounting the hung.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.700
Good old fashioned Condor practice,

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.999
to pay homage to the body stolen

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:24.580
from this year’s skin.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:32.820
Black bodies swollen, black bodies swinging,
black bodies swinging in the southern breeze.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.659
Deuteronomy 21 verse 23: “The body must
not be left hung from the tree overnight”.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.690
The body must not be left hung from the tree
overnight,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.549
the body must not be left hung from the tree,
the body must not be left, but the body must

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.460
not be, the body.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.920
You see, at night shoes were strand with cod liver oil,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.660
one thumb licked with disgust, two shadows.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.960
Black boys drawled in groups to windows, calling
their lovers and sing song, eat gin,

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.940
People from all over the place don’t know
nothing about dancing, and they wanted to

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.140
do the Carolina Shag the Collegiate Shag the
bop.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.160
These dances came from culture Basin of the
African Spirit, passed the rivers of blood

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.720
that bridged all the way back to the Middle Passage,

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.660
arrived on the shores of the Negro Identity, 
long before America would claim us.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:31.100
The dance play route like full-on swaying
bones, with sound crooked

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.860
like a neck snapping tomorrow breathless.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.600
Morning always came, with bodies smelling
like bitter herbs after hours of crowds contorted

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.720
into the colors of night.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.800
Swing wasn’t just fun, you know, it was a
very real claim of the Holy Vessel.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.460
See the legacy of slavery was a divided country.

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.980
Black men and brown women went missing through
the customs of hate crimes.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.720
Lynchings raped the South.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.580
But you see, there ain’t no bad the good
don’t come from.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.860
So when they left our brothers and sisters
hanging from them trees,

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:18.220
from the margins of society, we saw that swinging.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.750
We repurposed the movement, we swung with
them, made the white people do it too!

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.880
Industrious spines of the working class hung
on the air as musk, beer breath, and rhythm

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.300
only colored people could emit from breast.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.900
Lungs swung to impossible heights, legs swung
impossible heights, jumps moved in every direction,

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.540
the coast of swing.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.220
They say,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.380
what you give up violently, your
offer ever bound to.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.280
Every time somebody went missing, it sent
me into a timeless body, you see I had to swing,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.820
I was the anchor to the other side.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.780
Swing is limbs exhaling color lines at this
body’s right wrapping, crossing up themselves

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:59.780
on the dance floor.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.510
It is the dismemberment of steps in search
of missing parts, brother or sister.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.379
It is hooks in tunes wrapping arms noose-like
around waists

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.120
Every shift of the fingers was a measured
movement.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.180
Black bodies swung from the floor to verse.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.320
We were cold switching with the languages
in our bones.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.320
We were shotgunning with percussionists.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.860
Exhaling rhythm that would press and plead.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.500
Ladies watch with shifting skirts.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.440
Blood pooled in the legs first.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.500
Feet acknowledged each beat they were missing

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.440
as if they need to itemize each part of the holy congregation.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.060
Waist twist pop-less from the pelvis.

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.660
Hip over shoulder like branch over body.

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.780
Heaven has always been just beyond bent spines
and gasping.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.900
It is in the ache of emptied lungs

00:04:53.680 --> 00:05:00.960
and swollen
fingers, bulging eyes and the twisted mouth.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.880
If you find yourself wanting to taste this
dance,

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.900
then part the lips first and allow the collar bones to snap

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.680
into a cadence of swing.
