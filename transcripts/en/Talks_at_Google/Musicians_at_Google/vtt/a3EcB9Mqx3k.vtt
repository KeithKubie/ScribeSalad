[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:10.800
KARL RYAN: So hello, everybody.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.836
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:14.210
KARL RYAN: Oh, that's more
like the creative folk I know.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.150
Very good.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.850
So you're very welcome to
the first ever spark session

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.615
we have here in Cloud Nine,
our dedicated creativity

00:00:20.615 --> 00:00:23.100
and innovation
space, here in EMEA.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.348
So yeah, a round of applause.

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:25.848
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.848 --> 00:00:27.520
KARL RYAN: Great.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.890
What a remarkable
company we work for.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.880
We get to drink beer
and eat food and listen

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.964
to some of the greatest artists
in the world, all on an evening

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:37.130
where we can join together
collectively, communally,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.400
and collaboratively.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.320
I love it.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.110
So great.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.550
So just to let you
know, tonight is going

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.180
to be a really special event.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.830
I'm really, really
excited about our guest.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.804
He's an artist who's really
been on a remarkable journey.

00:00:49.804 --> 00:00:52.220
I'm just going to pull out a
quote for you, actually, just

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.190
for a second.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920
He's been on a
remarkable journey.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.100
And it's just a really
interesting story

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.530
he has to tell about creativity,
about the art of being

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.330
creative, the fear that
comes with being creative,

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.980
the beauty of it,
the truth, all that.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.688
So we're going to go
through all of that.

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:09.370
We're going to hear
some of his story.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.010
We're going to hear him play
some of his music tonight.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.050
We're also going to sing
and write a song together.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.290
Can I get a hell, yeah?

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.165
AUDIENCE: Hell, yeah.

00:01:17.165 --> 00:01:18.081
KARL RYAN: Hell, yeah.

00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:19.800
I hear some song
writers in the room.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.940
All right, that's great.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.398
So we're going to
do that together.

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:24.800
This night only works if
we're all in this together.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.410
This is an experience we share.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.410
This is an experience
where we come out beaming,

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:29.640
going I feel good.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.650
Creativity sparks my brain.

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.030
This is a spark session.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.130
So I'm really happy to
have you all here for that.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.710
So before I just introduce-- I
want to share you this quote.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.200
Because this I
think really tells

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.540
an amazing story about this
artist, and the kind of artist

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.580
we're about to listen
to and speak with.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.656
So some of you may be familiar
with a man called Ed Sheeran,

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:51.580
only one of the
finest songwriters,

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.390
and most well-known
in the world.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.271
He said this in a BBC
interview about Gary,

00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:57.270
who we're about to hear.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.475
He said "the reason
I use a loop pedal--"

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:01.600
We'll hear all about loop
pedals in a minute or so.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.630
"The reason I use
a loop pedal now

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.560
is because I saw a guy called
Gary Dunne use a loop pedal.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.350
I was 14 and I was
just blown away.

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.140
I was like this is incredible.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.930
I need to get one
of those pedals.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.050
So I did.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.280
And I made friends with Gary
and he taught me how to use it.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460
And that was the gig
that started me off

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.740
on the whole loop
pedal journey."

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.367
That is an amazing thing to
say about the artist you're

00:02:24.367 --> 00:02:24.950
about to hear.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.650
He's going to start
us off with a tune.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.550
I want you to give him a
massive, Googly, loving,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.270
creative roar.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Gary Dunne.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.200
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.652
GARY DUNNE: I've got a little
bit of set up to do here.

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:50.984
KARL RYAN: Shall I keep talking?

00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:52.072
GARY DUNNE: No, it's cool.

00:02:52.072 --> 00:02:53.016
KARL RYAN: OK.

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:56.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:58.724 --> 00:02:59.890
GARY DUNNE: How is everyone?

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.875
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.250
GARY DUNNE: First
time in Google.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.970
Good vibes.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.246
Good vibes in Google?

00:03:06.246 --> 00:03:06.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.341
GARY DUNNE: Yeah?

00:03:07.341 --> 00:03:08.132
AUDIENCE: The best.

00:03:08.132 --> 00:03:11.110
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.407
GARY DUNNE: Spot the boss.

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:26.285
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:16.502 --> 00:06:17.960
GARY DUNNE: Are we
singers, Google?

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.577
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:23.577 --> 00:06:24.910
GARY DUNNE: Come on, warm it up.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.784
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:26.784 --> 00:06:27.700
GARY DUNNE: Everybody.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.283
Come on, break it
down, break it down.

00:06:29.283 --> 00:06:30.933
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:30.933 --> 00:06:31.849
GARY DUNNE: Beautiful.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:38.464
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:38.464 --> 00:06:39.630
GARY DUNNE: Keep it rolling.

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:47.326
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:06:47.326 --> 00:06:48.322
GARY DUNNE: Beautiful.

00:06:48.322 --> 00:06:52.306
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:22.500
GARY DUNNE: Let's finish
together, a couple of times,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.180
"I know."

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.905
Three--

00:08:23.905 --> 00:08:27.430

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:30.340
[AUDIENCE SINGING]

00:08:42.934 --> 00:08:44.395
GARY DUNNE: Thank you, Google.

00:08:44.395 --> 00:08:44.895
Beautiful.

00:08:44.895 --> 00:08:50.353
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:50.353 --> 00:08:51.810
KARL RYAN: Thank
you, Gary Dunne.

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:54.060
Thanks for being here.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.780
I am intrigued by the loop
pedal, and all that it brings.

00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:00.400
Maybe-- could we
start by you just

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.712
talking us through what on
earth you're doing there?

00:09:03.712 --> 00:09:05.170
GARY DUNNE: Give
me a second, Karl.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.080
KARL RYAN: Oh sorry,
give you a second.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.620
Take a seat and tell us how
does this mad machine work.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:13.800
And how does it actually
even feed you creativity,

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.551
for that matter?

00:09:15.551 --> 00:09:18.349
GARY DUNNE: Eh.

00:09:18.349 --> 00:09:20.390
KARL RYAN: I started with
a really hard question.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.428
GARY DUNNE: I'm shifting
gears as well, from playing,

00:09:25.428 --> 00:09:26.992
to talking about playing.

00:09:26.992 --> 00:09:27.956
KARL RYAN: Sorry.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.890
GARY DUNNE: This thing
is called a live looper.

00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:41.520
And the way it works is
that I press a button,

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.560
and it records whatever sound--
my mic is making a funny sound,

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.100
talking about sound.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.380
It records whatever
sound is plugged into it.

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.070
So- oh, there you are, fridge.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:55.090
So I press the
button, play guitar,

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.480
press the button again,
and it loops, which

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.397
means that it plays on repeat.

00:10:00.397 --> 00:10:02.730
KARL RYAN: You can lay it,
and then layer on top of it--

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:03.030
GARY DUNNE: Yeah.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.120
KARL RYAN: -- and the
singing goes on top?

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:04.440
GARY DUNNE: Yeah.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.731
So then you can press it again.

00:10:05.731 --> 00:10:09.200
And so you can put down,
(IMITATES DRUM SOUND)

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.010
That loops.

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:10.705
Press it again.

00:10:10.705 --> 00:10:14.330
(IMITATES DRUM SOUND)
and build a track.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.432
KARL RYAN: So we know Edge
was impressed with it.

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:17.890
How did you get
into loop stations?

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:19.100
I can't imagine there
was a lot of people

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.183
using loop pedals back
when you were starting out.

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:22.400
GARY DUNNE: [INAUDIBLE] Karl?

00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:23.740
KARL RYAN: No, I mean
you're as old as I am.

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.440
So I guess that's
probably very young.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:30.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:34.780
GARY DUNNE: I got
into loop stations--

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:39.530
I was doing a gig in Cork with
an American songwriter called

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.594
Joseph Arthur.

00:10:40.594 --> 00:10:42.010
Has anyone heard
of Joseph Arthur?

00:10:42.010 --> 00:10:42.926
KARL RYAN: He's great.

00:10:42.926 --> 00:10:45.090
GARY DUNNE: Fucking
legend, legend.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:48.249
And the venue, the lobby,
which is a beautiful-- I

00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:49.540
don't know if it's still there.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:53.130
It's a beautiful room
over an old pub in Cork.

00:10:53.130 --> 00:10:55.850
A little small room about
the size of this many people.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.190
Kind of I don't
know, 30-40 people?

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.100
And I was booked by
the venue to play.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.610
And I rocked up,
and I was booked

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:06.160
to open for Joseph Arthur.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.200
At the time, I was doing
the kind of standard Dublin

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.570
singer-songwriter thing.

00:11:13.570 --> 00:11:16.840
There's a certain sound, and
I was very much in that sound.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.100
Rocked up to do my gig.

00:11:21.544 --> 00:11:24.690
And Joseph was-- Joe
as I call him now.

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:28.010
Joe, Joseph Arthur
was sound checking.

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:31.960
And I just went what
is going on here?

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.840
He not only had a
live looper, which

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.120
is a whole creative
performance tool in itself,

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:41.810
he also-- I get emotional
talking about this.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:47.740
He had loads of
effects pedals as well.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.450
So my set up is just an
acoustic guitar and a mic

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:53.010
going into that thing.

00:11:53.010 --> 00:11:54.910
So I can record
whatever I do to them,

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:56.850
and then make it into
kind of soundscapes.

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:01.730
He had these, going into
all kinds of special filters

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:02.247
and things.

00:12:02.247 --> 00:12:04.080
So he was creating these
insane soundscapes.

00:12:08.039 --> 00:12:09.080
And it just blew me away.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:11.205
And the next week I went
straight into Music Maker,

00:12:11.205 --> 00:12:13.051
in Dublin, to get
me a loop station.

00:12:13.051 --> 00:12:15.050
KARL RYAN: Come get the
finest loop station in--

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.630
GARY DUNNE: And Damien Rice
was opening on the same tour.

00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:19.455
And I met him in Whelan's a
couple of few weeks after.

00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:20.788
And we bought our loop stations.

00:12:20.788 --> 00:12:21.289
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:21.289 --> 00:12:22.746
GARY DUNNE: (IMITATING
DAMIEN RICE)

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:24.250
Where did you get
your loop station?

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:26.041
KARL RYAN: Where did
you get inspired to do

00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:26.849
a thing like that?

00:12:26.849 --> 00:12:28.640
Well listen, let's take
it back just a bit.

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.260
Because I'm curious
always-- and we're

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:32.120
talking about the sort
of creative process.

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.250
And you and I had sort of
chatted a bit over email

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:34.750
before this.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:38.040
But even just growing
up, I know you're

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:41.790
from Laois, just down the road.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:46.000
And your family life was
quite artistic, wasn't it?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.740
Like that was a
part of your life.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.640
So this must have
informed the way

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.310
you thought about
the world creatively

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.260
and artistically as well.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.080
GARY DUNNE: Yeah.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.240
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, well my
parents are both artists.

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:07.650
So it wouldn't have been the
conventional small town Ireland

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.420
upbringing.

00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.470
My dad is a novelist and
a playwright and a music

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.550
producer.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:19.182
And my mother is a poet
and a ukulele player.

00:13:19.182 --> 00:13:20.390
KARL RYAN: Interesting combo.

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.760
GARY DUNNE: So my two kids
have a ukulele playing granny,

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.885
which is great [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:23.885 --> 00:13:25.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:27.935
GARY DUNNE: But
yes, so I grew up

00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:30.930
in madness, creative,
chaotic madness.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:33.170
My dad set up the Laois
Arts Festival, which

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:36.204
was a big deal at the time.

00:13:36.204 --> 00:13:38.700
And I grew up, I
suppose, in a world

00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.967
where creativity was default.
It was just constant.

00:13:43.967 --> 00:13:45.550
I have go to my room
and write a book.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:47.805
I have to go to my
room and write a song.

00:13:47.805 --> 00:13:49.890
And that was just culture.

00:13:49.890 --> 00:13:52.440
You know, the culture was
just constant creativity.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:58.060
Gigs-- there were lots of
musos and artists in our life

00:13:58.060 --> 00:13:59.790
when I was a kid.

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:01.520
And it was always supported.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.530
So when I started playing
keys, little Bontempi

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.540
keyboard, when I was
about five or six.

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.960
My first gig-- the
Irish people will know

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.130
what I'm talking about here.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.025
My first gig was my
first confession.

00:14:16.025 --> 00:14:17.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.510
GARY DUNNE: We grow up Catholic
in Ireland, a lot of us

00:14:20.510 --> 00:14:22.370
grow up Catholic in Ireland.

00:14:22.370 --> 00:14:27.350
And they do this funny thing to
kids, where you have to get up

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:30.050
and confess when you're
six or something.

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.910
And all the kids
stand there confused.

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:38.080
Am I-- I stole
$0.10 from whatever.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:41.560
So my first gig was
playing "Amazing Grace"

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:42.886
on a Bontempi keyboard.

00:14:42.886 --> 00:14:44.260
KARL RYAN: In the
confession box?

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.218
AUDIENCE: On the stage.

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:46.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:46.222 --> 00:14:49.280
KARL RYAN: That is the weirdest
confession I've ever heard.

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.660
KARL RYAN: The priest is like,
five Hail Marys for that.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:55.690
GARY DUNNE: --confession?

00:14:55.690 --> 00:14:56.465
This song.

00:14:56.465 --> 00:14:57.084
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:57.084 --> 00:14:58.750
KARL RYAN: Check this
out, I wrote this.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:14:59.458
I'm really sorry.

00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:01.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:03.030
KARL RYAN: That's amazing.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:05.910
Obviously, you moved on
from that into guitar.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.910
Like you took a
journey, obviously,

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.740
where there was actually a
pretty thriving songwriter

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:13.410
scene going up in Dublin.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.700
When then later, when
you actually started

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.744
playing more formally,
out in the gigs and stuff.

00:15:18.744 --> 00:15:20.160
Tell us maybe just
even for people

00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.260
to get a sense of that
vibe of like, where was

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.650
the sort of the locus for that?

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:27.160
I know that there was
very specific gigs where

00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:28.160
people would go.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.072
And kind of the people
who were playing.

00:15:30.072 --> 00:15:31.530
And what were you
taking from that?

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:34.110
Even just creatively,
seeing other people working

00:15:34.110 --> 00:15:35.470
in that environment as well.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:45.930
GARY DUNNE: Ireland creates
amazing singer-songwriters.

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.540
It's something we
do really well.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:51.370
And I'm not arrogant enough
to put myself in that box.

00:15:51.370 --> 00:15:51.870
But we do.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.040
It's something from--
the Glen Hansard,

00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:58.900
Damien Rice, Van Morrison,
you know, I could go on,

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.160
Sinead O'Connor, Damien
Dempsey, go on and on and on.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.946
That bardic thing's
in our culture.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:13.180
So when I moved to Dublin from
Port Laois, when I was 17,

00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:15.970
I went straight into the
singer-songwriter scene.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:17.470
Now for those of
you who don't know,

00:16:17.470 --> 00:16:19.780
the Dublin singer-songwriter
is legendary.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.280
It was like the
lobby of Erin Cork.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.660
It was small rooms,
where people knew

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.500
they were coming out on a
Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.330
to listen.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.340
And that is the magic.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.171
It's the listening.

00:16:33.171 --> 00:16:35.670
Because when-- even here, when
I'm talking and you're-- like

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:37.800
we're kind of meeting
somewhere in the middle.

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.000
And when an audience does that,
it can make or break the gig.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.340
So these were small little
gigs run by grand people

00:16:44.340 --> 00:16:46.570
like Dave Murphy, Ken Burke.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:48.580
We just went to
boozers and said,

00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:51.700
can we have the upstairs
room on a Tuesday night?

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.470
Yep.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.950
What's gonna happen?

00:16:52.950 --> 00:16:55.060
Well, 50 people are gonna
come and buy a few pints

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:56.740
and listen to music.

00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:58.868
And it's going to be cool.

00:16:58.868 --> 00:17:05.470
And for me, I suppose, as a
formative performer back then,

00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:07.119
it was just incredible
to be sitting

00:17:07.119 --> 00:17:14.089
in these rooms listening to
heroes, completely unplugged.

00:17:14.089 --> 00:17:17.829
Like the raw, pure,
essential stuff.

00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:20.849
No mics, completely unplugged.

00:17:20.849 --> 00:17:26.829
So people like Damien Rice were
playing to 10 people there.

00:17:26.829 --> 00:17:29.810
And it was just electric.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:32.405
KARL RYAN: Do you remember
the first one, the first gig

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:35.235
you played in that scenario?

00:17:35.235 --> 00:17:36.620
Or do you remember the fear?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:38.330
Like the fear of actually
getting up and playing

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:39.450
a song in front of people?

00:17:39.450 --> 00:17:40.380
GARY DUNNE: Are we
going to go there, Karl?

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.890
KARL RYAN: Yeah, I think
we should go there.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:43.056
GARY DUNNE: Fear, man, fear.

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.660
The honest answer is the
first time I went to play,

00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:51.370
I didn't play because
I was too scared.

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:54.210
You laugh, it's the truth.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:57.370
I went to the International
Bar, on Wicklow Street.

00:17:57.370 --> 00:18:00.070
And that was the kind
of-- I kind of came

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:01.310
to the tail end of the scene.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:03.920
So there were kind
of songwriters

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:07.670
who had come through scene from
the previous five to 10 years.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.470
And some of them had
done really well.

00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:11.080
People like Mundy
had signed to Sony,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.020
and was off touring
with Neil Young,

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.040
was on the Romeo and
Juilet soundtrack.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:16.040
So there were big names.

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.520
It was a buzzy scene.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.020
And I came to that late.

00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:23.130
But my heroes were still around.

00:18:23.130 --> 00:18:26.617
So I went in, and it's
funny-- Damien Dempsey,

00:18:26.617 --> 00:18:28.950
who through other work has
become a good friend of mine.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:33.140
He was there and I
saw him at the bar.

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:35.130
And I went straight into panic.

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:41.155
I went I can't, I can't get
up and sing if he's here.

00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:44.800
And so my first gig,
I didn't play there.

00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.910
And I had gigged a lot.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:48.820
I used have-- right
back to Amazing

00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.570
Grace at my first confession.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:55.130
I was always performing.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:58.870
But I was just totally
paralyzed by the presence

00:18:58.870 --> 00:19:00.181
of these heroes.

00:19:00.181 --> 00:19:01.555
So I didn't play
in my first gig.

00:19:01.555 --> 00:19:06.120
And the first one I--
sure it was rubbish.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.710
But it was essential.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:11.220
That's the word that kind
of fits it best for me.

00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:17.220
Essential the core
idea, the core song.

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:21.800
No polished production.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:25.150
No dressing.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:28.580
It's like the idea,
the song, the message.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.710
And that had a
huge impact on me.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:31.460
Huge impact on me.

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.980
Because-- and I haven't
thought about this before.

00:19:33.980 --> 00:19:36.320
I often kind of
reflected on this.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.200
It had a huge impact
on me in the sense

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.330
that, especially with
singer-songwriters,

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:46.410
it's either there or it's not.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:49.170
Like you kind of say
that in business as well.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:51.970
It's either there or it's not.

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:56.950
You can bring in as many
consultants, as many re-brands,

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:59.930
as many kind of revisiting the
project, and blah, blah, blah.

00:19:59.930 --> 00:20:02.725
If it's not there,
it's not there.

00:20:02.725 --> 00:20:04.100
And the same is
true in the world

00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.100
I know best, which is music.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:09.265
And if you can throw
a big, sleek session

00:20:09.265 --> 00:20:12.235
band behind someone, you can
put them on stage at Wembley.

00:20:12.235 --> 00:20:19.110
If there's no song,
there's no song.

00:20:19.110 --> 00:20:19.650
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:23.110
KARL RYAN: Yeah, I
think also, just even--

00:20:23.110 --> 00:20:25.152
it's funny you talk about
the purity of the song.

00:20:25.152 --> 00:20:26.610
Isn't there a whole
school approach

00:20:26.610 --> 00:20:28.600
with producers, when they
make a record, like the best

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.266
thing to do is sit
in the car and listen

00:20:30.266 --> 00:20:32.580
to it on a shitty stereo
in the car, on the tape?

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.810
Because if the song is there,
you should be able to hear it,

00:20:35.810 --> 00:20:39.730
rather than just having all the
hullabaloo around it as well,

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:40.430
you know?

00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:42.705
GARY DUNNE: The car
speakers for me now

00:20:42.705 --> 00:20:44.680
have become my phone,
the phone speakers.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.240
Because most of
us-- hands up who

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.085
listens to music on
their laptop speakers?

00:20:51.808 --> 00:20:53.760
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.630
GARY DUNNE: Right?

00:20:55.630 --> 00:20:57.860
We're list- even
Mp3s, we're listening

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.890
to crap quality music.

00:21:00.890 --> 00:21:01.700
We are.

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.390
Unless you're going into
Wowza, and lossless thingies.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.120
I'm sure there are
techies here going,

00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.270
this guy does not know
what he's talking about.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.431
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:09.431 --> 00:21:11.410
GARY DUNNE: But
I've really noticed,

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:17.410
like when I go back to my my
parents' house-- listening

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.314
to an album in my childhood
home was like a ritual.

00:21:20.314 --> 00:21:21.980
I will come back to
your question, Karl.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:22.938
KARL RYAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:22.938 --> 00:21:25.110
GARY DUNNE: Listening to
it, it was like good food.

00:21:25.110 --> 00:21:26.990
If was like our culture.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.610
When the album
was bought, it was

00:21:29.610 --> 00:21:32.610
like-- say making a
coffee in the morning,

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:34.034
straight on to the vinyl.

00:21:34.034 --> 00:21:35.200
I can hear the little click.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:37.240
I can smell the--
the whole thing

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.260
was a multi-sensory experience.

00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.770
And on it went.

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:44.730
My dad has these big
vintage speakers.

00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.050
And it was like shut up.

00:21:48.050 --> 00:21:50.750
We are listening to
the album, you know?

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:53.450
Compared to-- I won't go
off on a whole tangent

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:56.120
about the disposable
nature of music now.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.740
Because it really has it's--
We're interested in the song

00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:01.392
for four days, and
then it's like--

00:22:01.392 --> 00:22:02.350
KARL RYAN: What's next?

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.450
GARY DUNNE: It was
a bit of everything.

00:22:03.450 --> 00:22:04.740
Back then, like an album.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.140
An album doesn't really
mean anything anymore.

00:22:07.140 --> 00:22:08.765
KARL RYAN: It's kind
of dead, isn't it?

00:22:08.765 --> 00:22:09.900
GARY DUNNE: It's all songs.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.480
Song, YouTube, millions
of views, the next song.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:17.852
But the idea of an
album as a body of work

00:22:17.852 --> 00:22:19.290
has kind of faded away.

00:22:19.290 --> 00:22:21.430
KARL RYAN: Well even
talking about that,

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.090
like so obviously you moved
from that to go and record

00:22:24.090 --> 00:22:24.850
your first album.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:26.720
Was that the shift over
to London at that point?

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.220
Or did you record the album
here in Ireland, your first one?

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:31.840
GARY DUNNE: Before
my first album-- so

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.100
I was living in Dublin.

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:36.190
And I recorded my
first EP, which

00:22:36.190 --> 00:22:39.130
was done in a bedroom in
the north circular road,

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.320
near Phoenix Park.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:44.070
And one of the
tracks from it was

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:48.150
selected to be on this best
of UK unsigned thing, which

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:49.855
brought me over to the UK.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.820
So the album actually
wasn't till much later.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.600
I moved to London first,
hit the scene there.

00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:00.137
Then came back to the west of
Ireland to record the album.

00:23:00.137 --> 00:23:02.720
KARL RYAN: And even just to give
a sense of that-- maybe we'll

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.250
ask you to maybe play
another song in a second.

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:06.600
But I just wanted to
understand, that transition

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.940
from the fear of not being
able to play a song in front

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:12.220
of Damien Dempsey, to go on and
gig in fairly sizable venues

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:14.240
across London, and like
getting your chops,

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.800
and getting out there, and
getting the songs up and going.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.380
Like what was that
as an artist like?

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.671
You're obviously-- you know
there's all the things that

00:23:20.671 --> 00:23:21.338
go with any job.

00:23:21.338 --> 00:23:23.295
Which is like, how am I
going to make a living?

00:23:23.295 --> 00:23:25.140
How am I going to
actually do my job well?

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.980
All of that, like it's a craft
that you're honing you know?

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:29.920
And the creativity is
coursing through you.

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.600
But you're trying to channel it.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.224
Tell us a little bit about that
journey, from the transitional,

00:23:34.224 --> 00:23:36.175
going right, I'm
going to London now.

00:23:36.175 --> 00:23:37.670
And I'm going to do this thing.

00:23:37.670 --> 00:23:40.340
That's a big moment, surely.

00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:43.850
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, it wasn't
that conscious at the time,

00:23:43.850 --> 00:23:44.960
to be honest with you.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:48.560
It was-- I think a lot
of people's early 20s

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.790
are a bit unconscious, in
the sense of doing things

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:55.470
in a considered way.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.580
We just kind of do things.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.270
Well, I did.

00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:01.900
I just kind of did things.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.370
So what was it like?

00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:08.620
I moved to London when
I was, I think 21.

00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:11.540
Literally, I decided on a
Friday, and moved on a Monday.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:16.330
And arrived in London
backpack, guitar, cliche.

00:24:16.330 --> 00:24:19.520
[INAUDIBLE] total
walking bohemian cliche.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.970
I arrived in the big city,
bag on my back, guitar.

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:26.840
And it was electrifying.

00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:29.000
You know, it was
a different way,

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.230
it was a different-- When you
grow up somewhere like Ireland,

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:37.020
where everybody knows everybody,
or knows what-- you're kind

00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:38.910
of one degree of separation.

00:24:38.910 --> 00:24:40.635
To move to the city
where essentially no

00:24:40.635 --> 00:24:42.410
one, doesn't matter.

00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:43.870
No one cares who you are.

00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:45.310
No one cares what you do.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.976
And that's a good
thing and a bad thing.

00:24:46.976 --> 00:24:50.030
Because you can-- it
really shakes you up

00:24:50.030 --> 00:24:52.580
to think about who you are.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:57.555
Because all your
old cultural norms

00:24:57.555 --> 00:24:59.680
and your interconnections
and your reference points

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.260
are all gone.

00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:02.680
You find yourself in this
mix with the whole world.

00:25:05.152 --> 00:25:06.860
So that was kind of
the personal journey.

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.930
It was like realizing, OK here,
things that people don't know

00:25:11.930 --> 00:25:13.210
what people knew in Ireland.

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.820
Things that were important
aren't important.

00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.830
It's just this
big flow of stuff.

00:25:22.485 --> 00:25:24.110
So that was the kind
of personal thing.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:30.210
And then creatively, making
a living as a musician--

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.300
I busked on the
tube for two years.

00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.920
And that was a
learning experience.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.960
I used to-- you just become
like a musical prostitute.

00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.659
You're in Piccadilly
Circus, and a gang of guys

00:25:44.659 --> 00:25:46.200
will come-- football
fans walking on.

00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.080
You go "Wonderwall"
would work here.

00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.000
(SINGING) Today was
going to be the day--

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.200
then that's (IMITATING
FOOTBALL FANS) Rawr--

00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.699
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:51.699 --> 00:25:53.760
GARY DUNNE: --and throw
you loads of money.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.085
And it's the same
thing-- You think

00:25:57.085 --> 00:26:01.920
about a prostitute,
musical jukebox,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:05.750
But it was, you
talk about chops.

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.130
That was heavy.

00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:13.230
I used to play down there on
Leicester Square for Pride,

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:14.130
down in Soho.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.180
So obviously loads of
loads of drag queens, loads

00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:20.560
and loads of that whole vibe.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:26.080
And I just had to play "I Will
Survive" over and over again.

00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.620
And I didn't even know the song.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.130
I'd just do the first
verse and chorus.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:30.890
That's enough.

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:33.330
So everybody, was on their buzz.

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:35.500
And I would love these
big colorful London,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.040
millions of people.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:39.720
And me here, this confused
little Irish dude,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.130
trying to make 100
quid to pay some rent

00:26:43.130 --> 00:26:46.037
for a shithole in Kentish town.

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:48.370
Just go (SINGING) first I was
afraid, and they'd all go,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:49.890
I was petrified.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:52.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:52.790 --> 00:27:01.060
GARY DUNNE: So my early time
in London, it was a crock.

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.110
KARL RYAN: Yeah,
maybe we'll take

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:04.277
a breather, just for a song.

00:27:04.277 --> 00:27:05.860
Because I want to
talk to you a little

00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:08.050
bit about your more
recent times in London,

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:10.300
and sort of the community
that you've built over there

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.136
and been a part of.

00:27:12.136 --> 00:27:15.070
But one of first songs I
actually heard you play

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:17.980
was the "Amerikan Folk Song,"
which I absolutely adore.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.920
And I wonder if you'd
maybe play that for us.

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.256
It's also a great example
of the loop stuff as well.

00:27:22.256 --> 00:27:23.010
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, sure.

00:27:23.010 --> 00:27:24.010
KARL RYAN: Is that cool?

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:25.367
Great.

00:27:25.367 --> 00:27:27.450
GARY DUNNE: Need to make
this seamless transition.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.282
KARL RYAN: Yeah.

00:27:29.282 --> 00:27:34.781
(HUMMING) (IMITATING DRUMS)

00:27:34.781 --> 00:27:36.530
GARY DUNNE: (SINGING)
First I was afraid--

00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:45.249
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:45.249 --> 00:27:47.040
GARY DUNNE: Where have
I put my pick, Karl?

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.524
KARL RYAN: Oh, I put it
in your back pocket, yeah.

00:28:00.444 --> 00:28:05.404
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:39.990
GARY DUNNE: I could go
with this all night.

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:41.983
[CHEERS]

00:33:41.983 --> 00:33:42.899
KARL RYAN: Gary Dunne.

00:33:42.899 --> 00:33:46.811
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:46.811 --> 00:33:48.278
GARY DUNNE: Thank you very much.

00:33:48.278 --> 00:33:50.234
Cheers.

00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:52.190
KARL RYAN: Let's
transition back to talking,

00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:54.635
Gary, if you'd like, seamlessly.

00:33:54.635 --> 00:33:56.102
That was absolutely amazing.

00:33:56.102 --> 00:34:00.892
And it's always a marvel
to watch you work.

00:34:00.892 --> 00:34:02.850
So I did want to ask you
a couple of questions.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.160
And then we will get
into the business

00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.240
of creating a piece of
art together, I think.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:08.730
Which is another big part
of what tonight's about.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:12.469
But I did want to ask you,
before we do that, just-- we

00:34:12.469 --> 00:34:14.780
talked a lot about
like-- you sort of said

00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:16.836
as you were thinking
about tonight,

00:34:16.836 --> 00:34:18.460
about talking about
your creative path.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:21.210
But also that it all connects
back also to community.

00:34:21.210 --> 00:34:23.940
And I know that's a huge part
of who you are and what you do.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.570
So maybe just even
just to give folks

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:27.236
a sense here-- maybe
just the transition

00:34:27.236 --> 00:34:31.360
from making your
music, all of that time

00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:34.290
that you did that, to the point
where you sort of tapered away.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:38.489
But that energy has gone into
a sort of a community work

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:39.230
that you do now.

00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:41.810
And tell us a bit about the
London Irish scene as well.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:43.429
And where that's gone.

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.219
Because I think that's
a fascinating part

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:47.856
of your creative story.

00:34:47.856 --> 00:34:48.480
GARY DUNNE: OK.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.604
There's a few bits to that.

00:34:49.604 --> 00:34:51.159
KARL RYAN: Yeah,
of course there is.

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.870
Let me just sum up
half of your life.

00:34:52.870 --> 00:34:53.495
GARY DUNNE: OK-

00:34:53.495 --> 00:34:54.909
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:54.909 --> 00:35:02.190
GARY DUNNE: When Karl asked me
to come and talk here tonight,

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:08.440
it was interesting to think
about-- it kind of forced

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.290
me to reflect on it,
to try and articulate

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:13.265
what I think about creativity.

00:35:13.265 --> 00:35:15.140
And it's not something
I've ever done before.

00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:18.480
I've kind of just been
in the flow all the time.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:20.200
So that's kind of
one part of it.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:23.010
And then to do
that, I'm thinking

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.620
about my own kind of story.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.230
I went back, looked
back over kind of 15,

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:29.915
20 years of doing
creative stuff.

00:35:33.194 --> 00:35:34.860
KARL RYAN: It's the
international symbol

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.651
for creative stuff.

00:35:35.651 --> 00:35:37.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:37.642 --> 00:35:38.350
GARY DUNNE: Yeah.

00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.450
And I've had a
"portfolio career."

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:47.200
I've had a mixed bag of stuff.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:51.410
But the constant threads
through the whole thing,

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.660
which were screaming at me when
I looked back over to think,

00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:58.500
were creativity and community.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.880
And those two things, for me,
are completely interwoven.

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:09.776
Because people
love making things.

00:36:09.776 --> 00:36:12.280
Hands up here who would like
more creativity in your life?

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.289
Felt a bit Oprah, didn't it?

00:36:17.289 --> 00:36:18.330
Who wants to talk about--

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:18.927
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:18.927 --> 00:36:20.510
KARL RYAN: There's
a bit of creativity

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:21.900
for everyone in here.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:24.570
GARY DUNNE: You know, now
that I've got that license,

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:26.010
I'm getting up on my soap box.

00:36:26.010 --> 00:36:28.260
This is what I think
about creativity.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.490
But it's-- and again, I will
come back to what you've asked

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.990
me.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:34.172
But it's an improvised
nature of things.

00:36:34.172 --> 00:36:36.380
KARL RYAN: I like where
you're going with this, Gary.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:40.410
GARY DUNNE:
Creativity, I believe,

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:42.610
based on my own
creative practice,

00:36:42.610 --> 00:36:50.581
with absolutely no theoretical
kind of neuroscience stuff,

00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:54.020
that creativity is a
fundamental part of humanity.

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:57.932
I think part of why
we're here is to create.

00:36:57.932 --> 00:37:01.540
Now you can expand that out
and talk about your life,

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.280
and go every moment that passes,
you are creating your life.

00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:07.900
Your greatest creative
act is your life.

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:09.870
Are you going to stay
working in Google?

00:37:09.870 --> 00:37:12.547
Are you going to move
home to Paris and do this?

00:37:12.547 --> 00:37:14.755
Are you going to set up,
are you going leave your job

00:37:14.755 --> 00:37:16.150
and open a cafe?

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.160
Are you going to buy that top?

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:20.140
Are you going to raise
your kids this way?

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:21.780
We're in constant self-creation.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.430
So anything that
I've been involved in

00:37:35.430 --> 00:37:36.635
has been around that energy.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:41.480
When I was a 12-year-old,
I was a member

00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.760
of our local tennis club.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.070
That's tennis, Karl.

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.037
That's creativity.

00:37:45.037 --> 00:37:45.871
KARL RYAN: So creativity--

00:37:45.871 --> 00:37:46.662
GARY DUNNE: Tennis.

00:37:46.662 --> 00:37:47.620
KARL RYAN: Tennis.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:48.470
We got that?

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.970
We're good.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:49.470
OK.

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:53.200
GARY DUNNE: And local tennis
club, small town tennis club.

00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.120
Crap at tennis I was.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.040
But it was where
everyone hung out.

00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.780
And there was a room, a space
like half the size of this.

00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.620
And my instinctive thing was
we have got to run gigs here.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.020
And I guess that creativity
is seeing what doesn't exist,

00:38:11.020 --> 00:38:14.110
and feeling
compelled to make it.

00:38:14.110 --> 00:38:20.670
And that's what I
have always done.

00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:23.730
And it only happens
in community.

00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:26.000
Now Karl, and whoever else
was involved, and I'm not--

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.583
and I don't know who
else is involved,

00:38:27.583 --> 00:38:31.800
in making tonight happen,
has or had a vision for what

00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:35.380
this thing could be.

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.842
And I love that vision.

00:38:36.842 --> 00:38:38.800
How I understand that
vision of coming together

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.000
to talk communally,
to talk creativity

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.170
and spark off each other.

00:38:45.686 --> 00:38:47.060
And that's what
I've always done.

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:49.330
And the two are
completely interwoven,

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:50.770
community, creativity.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:52.500
People come together,
they make things.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.280
People want to make things.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:00.630
Making better things, making
things better, in communion,

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:01.790
in community.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.170
It's completely
interwoven, you know?

00:39:04.170 --> 00:39:07.610
A song doesn't fully exist
until you sing it to people.

00:39:07.610 --> 00:39:08.980
If a tree falls, etc.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:12.540
But I mean, when
I'm at home writing

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:16.720
my tracks in the bedroom blah,
blah, blah, banging out a song.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.110
Oh killer, it's done.

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:24.870
I do not know that song until I
stand up here and sing for you.

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:27.432
Then I go, oh god, it's crap.

00:39:27.432 --> 00:39:28.890
KARL RYAN: Or it's
crap that night.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:30.390
GARY DUNNE: Or it's
crap that night.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:33.000
That's a whole other
thing, inner connection.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.310
For me, the function
of art, for me,

00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:38.230
if we're going to branch out
creativity, culture, art.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:41.010
The function of art
for me is to connect it

00:39:41.010 --> 00:39:43.539
to ourselves and to each other.

00:39:43.539 --> 00:39:45.330
If you're going to see
a movie with people,

00:39:45.330 --> 00:39:47.120
it's kind of part
about the movie,

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:49.670
but it's more about
art as social object,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.940
and the connection that you
have with the people you

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.280
are watching the film,
your experience in this.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.206
The artist made it
had a certain vision,

00:39:57.206 --> 00:39:58.580
you're connecting
in that vision.

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.020
It's that constant
communion, the communion part

00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:02.750
of community.

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.125
And that is what I'm about,
creativity and community.

00:40:06.125 --> 00:40:07.750
I think you're a bit
like that as well.

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:09.300
KARL RYAN: Yeah, certainly.

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:09.800
Absolutely.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.280
And I think even just when
I think about your story,

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.890
even just when you talked
about how you kind of took

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:19.900
a break from gigging,
and that sort of stuff.

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:22.650
But that creative spark,
that communion spark,

00:40:22.650 --> 00:40:24.770
that ideal of bringing
people together

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:27.553
in the service of
like an artistic idea,

00:40:27.553 --> 00:40:30.650
or a creative idea, I think is
a huge part of the work you've

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:33.291
done with the London Irish
Center and also the St. Patty's

00:40:33.291 --> 00:40:33.790
Day thing.

00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:36.480
I mean that's a colossal
community of people

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:37.650
that you're connecting.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.250
Just even give people
a sense of kind of what

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:41.870
that work is that you do now.

00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:45.780
I think that's really
interesting too.

00:40:45.780 --> 00:40:48.020
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, well
I'm director of arts

00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:49.790
at the London Irish Center.

00:40:49.790 --> 00:40:53.150
And the London Irish Center is
a charity and an old building

00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:54.750
in North London.

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:59.270
It was settled in the 1950s
for a huge wave of Irish

00:40:59.270 --> 00:41:01.620
that moved here when Ireland
was in deep recession.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:06.730
Post-World War Britain, WWII
Britain, hundreds of thousands

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:09.100
of Irish moved from
here to the UK.

00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.306
And this place was set up to
give basically a bed and a job.

00:41:12.306 --> 00:41:14.430
So kind of those two things,
it looks after people,

00:41:14.430 --> 00:41:17.760
and it kind of
brings them together.

00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:20.650
And about six or
seven years ago,

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:25.570
I was living in Camden
Town, which is historically

00:41:25.570 --> 00:41:27.550
quite an Irish area.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:33.690
And I realized one day that all
the homeless guys on the street

00:41:33.690 --> 00:41:34.190
were Irish.

00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:41.890
And I had moved to London-- I
had left in the Celtic Tiger.

00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:46.290
I grew up kind of
European Irish, you know?

00:41:46.290 --> 00:41:49.510
I had left-- I'd
moved to London.

00:41:49.510 --> 00:41:52.950
I think all of us have moved
into a international mix.

00:41:52.950 --> 00:41:54.070
My wife is Swedish.

00:41:54.070 --> 00:41:58.240
And I was kind of
in that global mix.

00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:00.990
And the whole-- I very much
felt like I'm in London.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:02.990
And I've kind of left--
not left Ireland behind.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:06.730
But I'm not there anymore.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.150
And as I said,
one day I realized

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:09.775
there were six or
seven dudes from here

00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:12.300
to the Tube station, which
is probably a 15 minute walk,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.300
and I realized that
they were all Irish.

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:18.120
And I said, what
is going on here?

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.170
If you're not Irish,
think if you're Spanish,

00:42:20.170 --> 00:42:22.900
if you're whatever,
you know Slovakian,

00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:25.960
if you go to a
global city, and you

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.520
realize that all the
people on the street

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.530
are your compatriots.

00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:32.640
It was a bit of a kind of what?

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.280
So I Googled.

00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:34.950
There you go.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:35.450
And I--

00:42:35.450 --> 00:42:37.780
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:37.780 --> 00:42:38.960
KARL RYAN: Alta Vista'd.

00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:42.846
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:42.846 --> 00:42:47.770
GARY DUNNE: I Googled
Irish, homeless, London.

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:50.868
I was genuinely
like, what the f--?

00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:56.000
And coincidentally, this place,
London Irish Center came up.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.490
Got involved there
as a volunteer.

00:42:58.490 --> 00:43:01.240
And this is where the creativity
and the community interplay.

00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:03.260
So I signed up as a
volunteer to begin with,

00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.580
which basically
means you're going

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.520
visiting quite broken,
socially isolated,

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.560
lot of mental health issues,
older Irish in London nursing

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.840
homes and old flats.

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.990
And I ran a kind of soup kitchen
for homeless Irish in London.

00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:25.900
And me being me, like week
two I had them blogging.

00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:29.680
And kind of singing
songs of their childhood.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:35.340
I just, to me, that community
aspect, the creativity needs

00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.530
community and the community
needs the creativity.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:39.810
That's why when we
come together, we sing.

00:43:39.810 --> 00:43:42.950
That's why when we come together
we talk about books we've read.

00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.100
That's why when we
go to festivals,

00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.570
we go-- something in us
resonates much more deeply.

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:50.980
That happens for me, anyway.

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.355
Nod if you've felt this.

00:43:52.355 --> 00:43:52.980
KARL RYAN: Yes.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.780
GARY DUNNE: You
go to a festival,

00:43:53.780 --> 00:43:55.821
you go to Glastonbury,
you go to Electric Picnic,

00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:58.870
you go, wow, I need
to think about chess.

00:43:58.870 --> 00:44:00.187

00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:01.520
GARY DUNNE: Because we're there.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.217
It's a communion.

00:44:03.217 --> 00:44:05.550
That's what the art and the
culture and the creativity's

00:44:05.550 --> 00:44:06.510
for.

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:07.780
To bring us together.

00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.174
To connect us to ourselves.

00:44:09.174 --> 00:44:11.090
And to connect-- exactly
what we're doing now.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.930
Bunch of people in
a room, connecting

00:44:12.930 --> 00:44:15.440
through culture and creativity.

00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.280
So long story short, I
started doing a project called

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.777
"Creatives" with them.

00:44:22.777 --> 00:44:25.360
KARL RYAN: You saw a room, and
said I need put a gig in there.

00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.984
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, it
was a bit of that.

00:44:26.984 --> 00:44:29.950
It was more I saw people, and
I wanted their story, actually.

00:44:29.950 --> 00:44:36.480
It was more like I can perceive
you as 75-year-old socially

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.010
isolated guy from
Derry, or you can--

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.260
KARL RYAN: Tell me your story.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.551
GARY DUNNE: Tell me your story.

00:44:41.551 --> 00:44:44.260
It was heavy, heavy stuff.

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.750
And that evolved into being
cultural officer, and then

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.840
director of arts.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.850
And there's this beautiful
cultural regeneration

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.070
happening at the London
Irish Center at the moment.

00:44:53.070 --> 00:44:54.860
Dermot O'Leary, the
"X Factor" judge,

00:44:54.860 --> 00:44:56.670
has come aboard as a patron.

00:44:56.670 --> 00:45:04.960
All the big musos like
Martin Hayes, Glenn Hansard,

00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.650
Sharon Shy, all the big
Irish musicians play there.

00:45:08.650 --> 00:45:10.810
We've got kind of
75,000 people plugged

00:45:10.810 --> 00:45:13.570
into our social media, which
is big for a specific community

00:45:13.570 --> 00:45:14.630
in one city.

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:18.700
And it's cultural regeneration.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.830
It's coming into something that
has a little bit lost its way.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:23.500
And it's not my doing.

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:25.640
I was part of the spark.

00:45:28.062 --> 00:45:29.270
But there's a team of people.

00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:31.790
It's a case of alignments,
you know, a bunch of people.

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.100
And it's moving at the moment.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:36.900
And separately to that work,
I'm creative programmer,

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.495
of the London St.
Patrick's Festival,

00:45:38.495 --> 00:45:44.749
which is a concert that happens
in Trafalgar Square every year.

00:45:44.749 --> 00:45:45.540
KARL RYAN: Big gig.

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:46.915
GARY DUNNE: It's
a big gig, yeah.

00:45:46.915 --> 00:45:49.250
Then it's parade through
London, 100,000 people.

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:51.830
Then we do events all
across London as well.

00:45:51.830 --> 00:45:56.200
We've had you know, Riverdance,
and Lord of the Dance,

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.660
We've had once the musical.

00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.740
Everyone who's
anyone has played it.

00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.070
And it's amazing.

00:46:02.070 --> 00:46:05.295
But it's the same
underpinning principle of--

00:46:05.295 --> 00:46:06.586
KARL RYAN: --bringing together.

00:46:06.586 --> 00:46:08.014
GARY DUNNE:
Communion, community.

00:46:08.014 --> 00:46:09.234
KARL RYAN: Yeah, absolutely.

00:46:09.234 --> 00:46:11.025
And for any of you who
do travel to London,

00:46:11.025 --> 00:46:12.830
I strongly recommend going
to the London Irish Center.

00:46:12.830 --> 00:46:14.120
Gary's being extremely humble.

00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:17.040
He has brought a
huge amount of art,

00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:19.980
and brought a real focus
on the Irish arts again.

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:22.759
We're in a golden age again
for spoken word, and music.

00:46:22.759 --> 00:46:24.550
And a lot of it is
channeled through there.

00:46:24.550 --> 00:46:26.360
So [INAUDIBLE] for that.

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.320
I really, really, really
respect that a huge amount.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:31.140
Just one last thing
before we actually

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.262
get cracking to make a
song here with these folks.

00:46:33.262 --> 00:46:34.720
I just wanted to
ask you one thing.

00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.880
And it's something that actually
is a topic we talk about Google

00:46:37.880 --> 00:46:41.130
a fair bit around,
well-being and mental health.

00:46:41.130 --> 00:46:43.690
I know that you've
trained quite deeply

00:46:43.690 --> 00:46:45.130
with the mindfulness stuff.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.840
And I know that's something that
you're really passionate about.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.671
I know we said we'd
go face the fear.

00:46:48.671 --> 00:46:50.170
And this is something
I think people

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.740
are afraid to talk about
sometimes, is mental health.

00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.100
Tell us about just
that if you can.

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:57.170
I know it's hard to
sum up in a short way.

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.600
But that transition to why
is that important to you?

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:03.600
Or like where does
that spring come from?

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:06.730
And what is it doing for your
creativity for that matter?

00:47:10.827 --> 00:47:12.410
GARY DUNNE: It's a
big question, Karl.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.493
KARL RYAN: I know, I know.

00:47:13.493 --> 00:47:15.100
But I only ask the
big ones, Gary.

00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:17.950
That's all I do.

00:47:17.950 --> 00:47:21.680
GARY DUNNE: Look the
honest answer here-- there

00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:22.840
are a few pieces to this.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:29.480
Firstly, I don't sign up for
the tortured artist archetype.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:31.910
You know suffering for my
art, and I'm an artist,

00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:33.880
so I can be a prick.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.580
Being an artist is
difficult. So is

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:39.260
being whatever your role
is in Google at times.

00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:40.540
So is being a surgeon.

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.780
So is being a plumber.

00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.600
So is being a nurse with
people who are terminally ill.

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.670
Being an artist is not magic.

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.710
|t's a thing you do.

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:53.210
You make things.

00:47:53.210 --> 00:47:59.440
So my point there, is
that the healthier I am,

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.240
the more creative I am.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:04.132
I used to sign up for that
troubled thing, you know?

00:48:04.132 --> 00:48:06.960
Kind of treat people like
crap, because I'm an artist.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:07.960
I'm working on my album.

00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.270
I'm in a bad space.

00:48:10.270 --> 00:48:12.927
Whether it's a
startup or it's you

00:48:12.927 --> 00:48:16.985
know, if a new boss starts here
and things start falling apart.

00:48:16.985 --> 00:48:19.090
You know, work is
a part of our life.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:22.350
And it can be difficult. And
you have to navigate that.

00:48:22.350 --> 00:48:26.247
And my work is art
and creativity.

00:48:26.247 --> 00:48:28.080
So I'm just going to
put it out there, Karl.

00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:29.038
Because I said I would.

00:48:29.038 --> 00:48:30.450
KARL RYAN: Put it
out there, man.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:32.408
GARY DUNNE: Mindfulness
a huge part of my life.

00:48:32.408 --> 00:48:35.070
And that came from-- I was
recording my second album

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:38.287
about, I I don't
know, a few years ago.

00:48:38.287 --> 00:48:39.745
And I started having
panic attacks.

00:48:39.745 --> 00:48:42.340
And I was-- there was stuff
going on in my personal life

00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:42.840
as well.

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:47.570
But I started having like
full on panic attacks.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:49.760
And I know I was being
a kind of anxious soul.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.040
You find a lot of creative
people-- sensitivity

00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:54.195
helps if you're creative.

00:48:54.195 --> 00:48:56.880
It's the whole
empathy thing, being

00:48:56.880 --> 00:48:58.850
tuned into where people are at.

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:04.660
And so I've always
been that kind

00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:09.820
of slightly nervy,
sensitive creative type.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:11.700
[ALARM BEEPS]

00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.570
GARY DUNNE: Wow, what's that?

00:49:13.570 --> 00:49:15.820
KARL RYAN: I'd have to take
the bread out of the oven.

00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:18.510 --> 00:49:19.992
GARY DUNNE: Saved by the bell.

00:49:19.992 --> 00:49:21.450
Quick, too many
[INAUDIBLE] people.

00:49:21.450 --> 00:49:22.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:23.260
KARL RYAN: fine.

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:24.010
We're fine now.

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:24.604
Sorry.

00:49:24.604 --> 00:49:26.020
Sorry for that
interruption, Gary.

00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.522
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, so
I was doing an album.

00:49:32.522 --> 00:49:33.980
And I started having
panic attacks.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:35.625
And for anyone who's
never had panic attacks,

00:49:35.625 --> 00:49:36.374
it's fucking hell.

00:49:36.374 --> 00:49:39.210
You think you're going to die.

00:49:39.210 --> 00:49:41.802
And I went to my GP.

00:49:41.802 --> 00:49:44.864
And she said, medication
or meditation?

00:49:47.470 --> 00:49:49.540
A wise old Jewish
woman in North London.

00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.965
Medication or meditation.

00:49:51.965 --> 00:49:56.572
And I said, meditation, please.

00:49:56.572 --> 00:49:59.100
And she signed me up for
a mindfulness course.

00:49:59.100 --> 00:50:01.520
And I don't want to use words
that are as tired as, "it

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.228
changed my life."

00:50:02.228 --> 00:50:03.420
But it did.

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.720
And the whole self-care,
self-awareness, kindness,

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.360
compassion, gratitude,
fundamentals--

00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:16.320
And it's a fundamental
thing in my life.

00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:20.900
I couldn't, here be
here tonight-- sorry

00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.530
if this is going to mess
with that recording otherwise

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.760
[INAUDIBLE].

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.280
I couldn't-- I was shitting
myself before today.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:33.000
Absolutely crapping
myself with nerves.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.074
Meditated, grand.

00:50:35.074 --> 00:50:35.870
AUDIENCE: Whoo-hoo.

00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:37.590
GARY DUNNE: Any
meditators in the room?

00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:40.440
Any mindfulness heads?

00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:43.290
Lovely.

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.350
Secular meditation is my trip.

00:50:45.350 --> 00:50:47.110
And it's the self-care piece.

00:50:47.110 --> 00:50:51.340
You can work, and worry,
and waste your life

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.750
away through creating
disaster things in your head.

00:50:54.750 --> 00:50:57.945
Or you can learn through
practice how to be present.

00:51:01.112 --> 00:51:02.070
KARL RYAN: That's why--

00:51:02.070 --> 00:51:03.670
GARY DUNNE: And it's helped me.

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:05.730
It's changed my life.

00:51:05.730 --> 00:51:07.730
It's helped me massively.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:10.040
It has made everything better.

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:13.150
And it's a key-- I
couldn't create--

00:51:13.150 --> 00:51:15.100
it's the self-care
piece of committing

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.100
your life to creativity.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.840
'Cause creativity is scary.

00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.470
Because it creates uncertainty.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:22.660
And uncertainty is scary.

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.950
And my whole life is
that, other than my kids

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:27.920
and my wife and other things.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:32.560
But my working life is all
about creating the unknown,

00:51:32.560 --> 00:51:35.140
uncertainty, fear, [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:37.067
It's why I need that.

00:51:37.067 --> 00:51:39.400
KARL RYAN: Well thanks a
million for sharing that, Gary.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:42.140
It is something that I try to
make part of my life as well.

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:46.530
So in the spirit of uncertainty,
and fear of facing shit

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.180
that's difficult,
what do you say

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.698
we try and write a song here?

00:51:50.698 --> 00:51:52.323
And maybe just to
kick things off, will

00:51:52.323 --> 00:51:54.490
you and I just show
what we're going to do?

00:51:54.490 --> 00:51:56.800
And then we'll gradually
pull people up, and maybe

00:51:56.800 --> 00:51:57.970
write some kind of a song?

00:51:57.970 --> 00:51:58.840
Does that sound
like a good plan?

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:01.150
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:01.290
No.

00:52:01.290 --> 00:52:01.780
KARL RYAN: All right.

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:02.280
OK.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:04.400
So maybe-- what's
the best thing?

00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:05.780
Do you want to give me a beat?

00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:07.594
And I'll shout something
in a microphone.

00:52:07.594 --> 00:52:09.010
And that will be
a starting point.

00:52:09.010 --> 00:52:11.676
And then maybe somebody else can
come up and sing a melody line.

00:52:11.676 --> 00:52:15.110
And listen, we're all
about facing these fears.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.200
It's not going to be easy to
come up here on a microphone.

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.450
But you should face that fear.

00:52:19.450 --> 00:52:20.699
Because it's going to be good.

00:52:20.699 --> 00:52:22.680
And also, failure is fine.

00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.230
In fact, failure is just
actually acceptable.

00:52:25.230 --> 00:52:27.320
We can also stop the
loop at any time, right?

00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.769
Go, let's start again, right?

00:52:28.769 --> 00:52:29.810
GARY DUNNE: Yeah, we can.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:31.030
KARL RYAN: Yes we can.

00:52:31.030 --> 00:52:31.530
All right.

00:52:31.530 --> 00:52:33.020
GARY DUNNE: But this is it.

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.399
It's the fear thing.

00:52:34.399 --> 00:52:36.190
How many people here
would feel comfortable

00:52:36.190 --> 00:52:39.140
standing up and singing a song?

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.400
Great.

00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:43.137
That's a high-- that's a good
Google culture going on there.

00:52:43.137 --> 00:52:43.720
Strong people.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:44.426 --> 00:52:46.826
You ask that in another
place, and it's like, what?

00:52:46.826 --> 00:52:49.200
KARL RYAN: They actually leave
at that point. [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:53.380
he's going to ask me,
it's like school, right?

00:52:53.380 --> 00:52:54.630
I'm absolutely with you, Gary.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.900
I think it's that,
it's like you said.

00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:59.290
It's one thing having written
a song and putting it out

00:52:59.290 --> 00:53:02.000
in the word, or written a poem,
or whatever it is that we do,

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.350
our creative selves.

00:53:03.350 --> 00:53:06.327
But the act of creating in
the moment, collectively,

00:53:06.327 --> 00:53:08.160
that even-- like that's
a whole other level.

00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:10.700
Because it's actually--
anything can happen, right?

00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.260
But that's also the best bit.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:14.492
Anything can happen, right?

00:53:14.492 --> 00:53:15.950
GARY DUNNE: Karl
and me are looking

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.480
at each other going, what are
we actually going to make?

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:18.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.290
KARL RYAN: Fuck it.

00:53:20.290 --> 00:53:22.195
Give me a beat, and
we'll see where we go,

00:53:22.195 --> 00:53:23.070
and see what happens.

00:53:23.070 --> 00:53:25.150
And then we'll do one
that may be a bit more

00:53:25.150 --> 00:53:26.340
structured after this.

00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:27.336
How about that?

00:53:27.336 --> 00:53:29.585
GARY DUNNE: This is simply
to illustrate the process--

00:53:29.585 --> 00:53:30.050

00:53:30.050 --> 00:53:31.890
GARY DUNNE: --of what
we're going to do together.

00:53:31.890 --> 00:53:33.258
KARL RYAN: This is where
we get it horribly wrong,

00:53:33.258 --> 00:53:35.170
and then we try and
do it horribly right.

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:36.630
GARY DUNNE: So we're doing
nothing-- we're making excuses.

00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.880
KARL RYAN: Oh yeah--

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.220

that kind of a groove.

I'm not saying it's
going to be great.

this kind of setting.

an hour to write a song.

going to have to-- I

want to see some super Google

I reckon if I could
put a framework on it,

00:58:36.476 --> 00:58:39.620
it's like let's write a
team song for this space,

00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.450
or write a song for
the spark sessions.

like a good plan?

about spark sessions,

00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:55.010
I want you to shout out--
what do you reckon, Gary?

this is about the

01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:40.146
So what we want here is
some kind of a little--

01:00:40.146 --> 01:00:41.520
let's say I'm
talking about verse

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.530
and a chorus around spark.

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:44.140

the song is about.

Next thing.

01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.548
We have a song.

01:00:54.548 --> 01:00:55.922
You're looking at
a rhythm/tempo.

01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:01.140
So is it like fast, slow?

01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:03.905
You're looking at melody,
some kind of a tune.

01:01:03.905 --> 01:01:07.040
And you're looking at words.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.390
So these are the bits.

01:01:09.390 --> 01:01:11.740
Any of the musos in the
room are going, yeah I know.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:13.490
But for people who
don't write songs,

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:14.698
that's what we're looking at.

01:01:14.698 --> 01:01:17.690
We'll write this
song about spark.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:18.482
So let's talk--

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:19.690

01:01:19.690 --> 01:01:20.649
GARY DUNNE: The rhythm.

01:01:20.649 --> 01:01:21.564
KARL RYAN: The rhythm.

01:01:21.564 --> 01:01:22.830
OK, that's a good start.

01:01:22.830 --> 01:01:23.913
That's the beat, the vibe.

beat, is that what I heard?

01:01:46.779 --> 01:01:47.982

Like sound it out if you can.

Do you have a beat
that you want to hear?

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:58.270
GARY DUNNE: Feel free to talk
about other musical references.

01:01:58.270 --> 01:02:02.440
We are a mashup of the
culture we consume.

It's fine.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:04.939

Williams-type [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:05.928 --> 01:02:07.802

what that means yet.

01:02:07.802 --> 01:02:10.530

"Happy" hip hop.

Oh, the song by Pharrell, as
opposed to a gust of wind.

We can add a gust
of wind, though.

with this loop station.

just a very nice solid beat

hip hop vibe to it.

what we could go for.

So maybe like a bit of the
singer-songwriter thing,

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:04.190
and then we kick into a beat.

need to establish our beat.

Because we need to know
where we're going with this.

have to figure out,

01:03:50.956 --> 01:03:53.130
is the intro gonna
set the color?

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.024
Or is the intro going to build
to when the beat comes in?

put the beat down.
