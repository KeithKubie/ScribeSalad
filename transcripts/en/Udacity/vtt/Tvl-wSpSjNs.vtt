00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:04.895
[SOUND] Great job colorizing
your command line output

00:00:04.895 --> 00:00:07.336
in the previous project.

00:00:07.336 --> 00:00:10.259
Not only will the text be much easier
to see out here in the wilderness, but

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.940
it'll also help you in your
future development career.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.790
You are now ready to start the
simulation part of your survivor camp.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:17.540
The purpose of the game is
to take contestants and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.250
put them against each other in
a series of challenges to declare

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.380
an ultimate winner.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.060
You'll be using your knowledge of Ruby's
object orientation, as well as TDD,

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.070
test driven development, to ensure
that a new winner wins every time.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.070
The test driven development workflow
may seem a little strange at first, but

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.290
that's to be expected.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.460
Learning how to read tests and make them
pass is an incredibly useful skill for

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.370
all developers.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.840
So if you're ready for your next
survivor challenge, let's get started.
