00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:06.460
At the center of our galaxy, lies a region
known as Sagittarius A* -- widely believed

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.280
to be the location of a supermassive black
hole, about 4 million times the mass of our

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.719
sun.

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.340
But while there is insurmountable evidence
that this black hole actually exists, there

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.830
is some skepticism surrounding it.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.900
That’s because like all black holes, astronomers
have yet to observe it directly to confirm

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.140
it’s existence.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.070
But the race is on to be the first.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.730
This the Cerro Paranal in the Atacama Desert
in Northern Chile.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.120
At around 2600 metres above sea level, the
desert sits above much of the moisture in

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.589
Earth’s atmosphere, making it one the driest
places on earth, an ideal place for building

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.199
the world’s most powerful telescope.

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:51.319
But observing a supermassive black hole in
the middle of the Milky Way takes more than

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:56.829
just one powerful telescope in near perfect
conditions, it takes several.

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.809
The ‘Very Large Telescope’ array or VLT
for short, sits in the Atacama Desert and

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.980
uses four massive optical telescopes to study
the goings on in Sagittarius A Star.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:14.820
[Oliver] We are roughly thirty thousand light
years away from the centre of our galaxy in

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:22.400
a spiral arm, but we can very well study this
region of the galactic centre.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.610
Astronomers are able to utilize the power
of all four telescopes in the VLT array to

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.910
explore and understand the Milky Way using
a technique called interferometry.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.770
Normally, the resolution of an optical telescope
is limited by the size of the main mirror

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.930
inside it.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.750
The bigger the mirror, the more light can
be picked up, the more detail you can see.

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.970
But, if we wanted to see the depths of the
Milky Way with just one telescope, we would

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.470
have to build a 100 meter wide mirror.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.020
Which would be technically impossible.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.680
But with interferometry, the light beams captured
by all four optical telescopes in the VLT

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.250
array, can be combined using a computer.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.700
This basically creates a single telescope
with a “virtual mirror” as large as the

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.350
furthest dishes are apart from each other.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.729
This takes care of the impossible to build,
gigantic mirror.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.010
[OLIVER] We are using a very fundamental property
of light.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.390
In this case we can recreate almost the resolution
of a hundred meter diameter telescope.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.340
This means astronomers like Oliver can use
the VLT to study the center of our galaxy,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.340
including activity surrounding the supermassive
black hole.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.810
[OLIVER] ….We know that this black hole
is actually not black.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.610
Once in awhile it flares, so we see it brightening
and darkening.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.810
We believe there must be some matter that
is falling in.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.430
[OLIVER] If we can study these motions which
happen so close to the black hole, we have

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:53.960
a direct probe of the space time close to
the black hole.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.090
In this way we have a direct test of general
relativity in one of the most extreme environments

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.480
which you can find in the universe.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.300
The extreme environments within Black holes
are down to the strong gravitational forces

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.300
they possess meaning that nothing - including
light—can escape its clutches.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.300
Currently Oliver’s work is looking at relativity
around the black hole thought he hopes to

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300
one day use the VLT to see exactly what happens
to space time directly inside it.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.170
But as much as it seems like the VLT is sitting
alone in this vast, dry desert, they actually

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.170
have a neighbor.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.300
(insert distance between 2)

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.640
This is the Atacama Large Millimeter Array
also known as ALMA.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.630
It is a radio telescope comprised of 66 state-of-the-art
antennas, equipped with receivers so sensitive,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.459
they can pick out a golf ball 9 miles away.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.569
And by using interferometry to harness all
66 antenna’s ALMA is able to study regions

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:41.060
of space that the optical VLT cannot -- notably
the coldest and dimmest objects in our universe,

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.880
like the center of a supermassive black hole
or where stars are formed.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.830
[GIANNI] In the universe, the stars are forming
in the cold matter...

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:59.680
….In the optical it is much more difficult
to do interferometry...

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.849
...you cannot investigate, for example, cold
matter because you cannot see it.

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:10.349
….ALMA can go behind this limitation and
can see where the stars are formed.

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:14.090
In this respect, ALMA is opening, to me, a
completely new horizon.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.989
You can see details that are better than what
space telescopes can observe in space out

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:20.989
of the atmosphere.

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.050
But what’s really exciting for astronomers
like Gianni, is that ALMA is actually a smaller

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.840
piece of a much, much larger puzzle.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.870
In 2015, the array became part of The Event
Horizon Telescope, a project that utilizes

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.240
interferometry to unite a network of radio
telescopes from around the world.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.970
Essentially the EHT is a virtual radio telescope
the size of our planet, making it the largest

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.949
ground-based astronomical project in existence.

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:56.270
By 2017, the EHT hopes to observe the ‘event
horizon’ of the supermassive black hole

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:01.280
at Sagittarius A* -- which is the boundary
marking the limits of the black hole beyond

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.680
which nothing can escape.

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.990
Which has never been done before and could
provide further evidence that this black hole

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.590
at the center of our universe, exists.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:15.910
But this isn’t about who can do this first.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:21.570
For these astronomers working in the Atacama,
it is about having a greater understanding

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.600
of the universe.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:27.440
It’s about working together, pooling knowledge
to do something that has never been done before.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440
Simply put...

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.885
[OLIVER] Our main science goal is, in fact,
to observe the black hole in the galactic

00:05:31.885 --> 00:05:32.885
centre.

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:37.000
The DNews team recently travelled to the Lowell
Observatory in Arizona to find out what ground

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.670
telescopes can tell us about the universe.
