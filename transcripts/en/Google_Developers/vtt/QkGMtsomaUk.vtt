00:00:04.355 --> 00:00:06.480
EMILY FORTUNA: Here with
us now is Harsh Kharbanda,

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.250
product manager on Lens.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.285
Welcome, Harsh.

00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:10.693
HARSH KHARBANDA: Hi, Emily.

00:00:10.693 --> 00:00:13.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Harsh, there
were so many AR announcements

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.330
at I/O. Let's go a little
deeper with one of them--

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.290
Lens and Google Go.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.010
Can you take us back to when you
all were first conceiving it?

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.083
What were the problems that
you were trying to solve?

00:00:23.083 --> 00:00:24.000
HARSH KHARBANDA: Sure.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.250
So technology is getting
cheaper and more accessible.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.160
Smartphones today can
cost as little as $50.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.620
And while building all our
OCR and document instruction

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.150
understanding
capabilities in Lens,

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.030
we realized that these can
be transformational for users

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.252
new to smartphones.

00:00:37.252 --> 00:00:39.210
There's two things that
we realized about users

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.350
who are new to smartphones.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.900
The first thing is that
the smartphone is likely

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.610
their first digital device.

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.400
Unlike you and I, they haven't
grown up with desktops.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.165
And so the keyboard itself
is a novel concept for them.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:51.540
They have to learn
how to express

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.810
information needs for the first
time on a 2-inch keyboard.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.970
And typing is just
fundamentally hard.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.068
The second thing we realized was
that these users typically have

00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:02.360
lower literacy rates, which
means that they come across

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.190
text throughout their lives--
bank forms, ATM notices,

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:06.165
street signs--

00:01:06.165 --> 00:01:08.040
text that they want to
understand, but really

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.120
have to depend on
others to do so.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.420
But the camera is something
everybody knows how to use.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.770
The selfie has really made
its way around the world.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.010
So we thought, what if we
could build a camera that

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.480
could help you
learn, understand,

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.912
and read the world around you.

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:21.870
And that's what we did
with Lens and Google Go.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.680
EMILY FORTUNA:
That's super cool.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.470
I first see myself making use
of Google Go when I travel,

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.040
for example.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.860
It's like, if I don't know
a language or the alphabet,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.590
it's like I have my own
personal translator.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.090
Can you tell us
about the first time

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.940
you saw someone use Lens
how you had envisioned?

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.080
HARSH KHARBANDA: Sure.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.000
So we've been testing
Lens and Google Go

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.270
over the past several months.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.190
And we've seen people use it
in several different instances

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:46.800
throughout their daily lives--
bank forms, ATM notices,

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.753
product packages,
medicine labels.

00:01:48.753 --> 00:01:50.170
But the point where
we realized we

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.620
were making a true impact
on the users' lives

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.040
was when we saw a parent
using Lens and Google Go

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.010
on their child's homework to
understand what the homework

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.350
problem was and help
them in their education.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.810
Before that, the
homework was in English.

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.810
The parent could not
really help the child.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.110
But in this case, they were
able to take a picture,

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.580
translate it into the
language that they understood,

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.680
and understand the problem
and be really a part

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.252
of their child's education.

00:02:15.252 --> 00:02:16.710
And that is something
that's really

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.002
humbling and gratifying to see.

00:02:18.002 --> 00:02:20.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Harsh, that
sounds really awesome, and also

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.300
fairly complex.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.550
Can you tell us about some
of the technical challenges

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.020
that you faced
while building this?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.937
HARSH KHARBANDA: Yeah.

00:02:25.937 --> 00:02:27.420
So to be able to
do all of this, we

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.700
had to bring the
technology to a phone

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.000
that new smartphone users
would be able to afford.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.097
And so we had to bring OCR
to be able to understand

00:02:36.097 --> 00:02:38.430
the text that users take a
picture of-- machine learning

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.260
to translate the text
into the language

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.420
that these users
speak, TTS to be

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.880
able to read it out in a
very naturally accented form.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.750
And even AR to highlight each
word as it's being read out.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.790
All of that is done on a phone
that costs as little as $50

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.480
and an APK footprint
of 100 kilobytes.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.808
And that was a really hard
technical challenge for us.

00:02:56.808 --> 00:02:59.350
EMILY FORTUNA: Harsh, thank you
so much for joining us today.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.290
HARSH KHARBANDA:
Thank you, Emily.
