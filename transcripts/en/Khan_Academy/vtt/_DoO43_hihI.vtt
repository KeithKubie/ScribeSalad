00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:40.926
- Hello and welcome back
to Khan Academy Live SAT.

00:06:40.926 --> 00:06:42.983
I'm Eric, I'm an SAT tutor and one of the

00:06:42.983 --> 00:06:45.665
SAT experts here at Khan Academy

00:06:45.665 --> 00:06:47.895
and today is our third and final class

00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:49.285
as a part of this series.

00:06:49.285 --> 00:06:51.290
We've covered SAT math two weeks ago,

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.283
last week we covered SAT reading,

00:06:53.283 --> 00:06:55.334
and today will be on SAT writing.

00:06:55.334 --> 00:06:58.458
Now if you missed any of those
previous classes don't worry.

00:06:58.458 --> 00:06:59.806
Just head to our YouTube channel and

00:06:59.806 --> 00:07:01.673
you can find the class recording there

00:07:01.673 --> 00:07:03.334
where you can re-watch, pause,

00:07:03.334 --> 00:07:04.677
fast-forward, do whatever you need

00:07:04.677 --> 00:07:08.182
to get what you want out of those videos.

00:07:08.182 --> 00:07:10.047
If you're joining us for the first time,

00:07:10.047 --> 00:07:12.261
one quick tech tip to help you get

00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:15.645
the most out of this class
is to go to full screen

00:07:15.645 --> 00:07:18.165
on YouTube and try and up the resolution

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:21.444
to the best quality that you can,

00:07:21.444 --> 00:07:23.275
because we'll be going through

00:07:23.275 --> 00:07:25.752
real SAT writing questions,
and so being able

00:07:25.752 --> 00:07:27.958
to read everything will be really helpful.

00:07:27.958 --> 00:07:30.414
So today's class is on SAT writing,

00:07:30.414 --> 00:07:32.466
so before we dive into the materials

00:07:32.466 --> 00:07:35.305
let's take a look at the topics for today.

00:07:35.305 --> 00:07:37.305
So first up I'm gonna do some instruction

00:07:37.305 --> 00:07:38.690
and some practice problems, and so the

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.593
first thing I'm gonna do is provide

00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:42.558
a quick overview of the writing test

00:07:42.558 --> 00:07:44.964
and share some tips for how you can

00:07:44.964 --> 00:07:47.825
mark up the test and be more proactive

00:07:47.825 --> 00:07:51.060
when it comes to SAT writing questions.

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:53.416
Next up I'm gonna cover
subject-verb agreement

00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:55.283
and do some practice problems,

00:07:55.283 --> 00:07:57.668
and third I'm going to go over

00:07:57.668 --> 00:07:59.100
sentence punctuation and again

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.491
do some real practice problems.

00:08:01.491 --> 00:08:03.762
In the middle I'll pause for some Q and A,

00:08:03.762 --> 00:08:05.637
and actually as I'm going through

00:08:05.637 --> 00:08:08.546
this writing class feel free to throw in

00:08:08.546 --> 00:08:11.133
any questions that you
have as I'm going along

00:08:11.133 --> 00:08:12.854
into the YouTube chat and then I'll

00:08:12.854 --> 00:08:15.049
get to as many as I can
in the middle there.

00:08:15.049 --> 00:08:17.880
And then finally I'm
going to close things out

00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.200
by working through an SAT writing passage,

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.563
and so this is going
to be a 45 minute class

00:08:23.563 --> 00:08:26.563
all told, and so that's a sneak peak

00:08:27.483 --> 00:08:29.171
at what is ahead and so there's a lot

00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:30.926
of material to cover, a lot of grammar,

00:08:30.926 --> 00:08:33.415
a lot of writing concepts to learn,

00:08:33.415 --> 00:08:37.082
and so let's jump into
the very first topic.

00:08:39.071 --> 00:08:41.037
So first a quick overview of the

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:42.889
SAT Writing and Language Test.

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:45.536
So in total this is a 35 minute section

00:08:45.536 --> 00:08:47.786
and you have 35 minutes
to do four passages

00:08:47.786 --> 00:08:50.269
with 11 questions each, and so what I want

00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:52.434
to emphasize here is
that means you do need

00:08:52.434 --> 00:08:55.195
to move at a decent pace throughout,

00:08:55.195 --> 00:08:58.318
but you'll notice that
all of these questions

00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:02.731
come within passages, and so
context is very important.

00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:06.545
It's a bit like the SAT
reading section in that

00:09:06.545 --> 00:09:09.467
what comes before and after the question

00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:11.873
makes a very, is really important

00:09:11.873 --> 00:09:14.471
in helping you find the right answer.

00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:16.507
So that's what you'll have to expect,

00:09:16.507 --> 00:09:19.184
and then in terms of
topics and passage types,

00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:21.942
here's a sneak peak at
that, and so you'll have

00:09:21.942 --> 00:09:24.430
a variety of topics that fall into

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:27.557
a variety of passage type options.

00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:29.197
Then in terms of the
questions that you can

00:09:29.197 --> 00:09:32.484
expect to see, there are
two that I want to call out.

00:09:32.484 --> 00:09:35.320
The first are expression
of ideas questions,

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.324
and these really ask you to improve

00:09:37.324 --> 00:09:38.772
the effectiveness of a communication,

00:09:38.772 --> 00:09:42.280
and so what that means is it might ask you

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:45.174
how you might clarify and
add clarity to the passage.

00:09:45.174 --> 00:09:48.757
It might ask you to
strengthen an argument.

00:09:49.617 --> 00:09:50.929
So it's all about communicating

00:09:50.929 --> 00:09:53.590
the author's point more effectively.

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:55.322
The second question type focuses

00:09:55.322 --> 00:09:56.926
on standard English conventions,

00:09:56.926 --> 00:09:58.845
and this is probably what you might be

00:09:58.845 --> 00:10:01.024
more used to seeing and this is all about

00:10:01.024 --> 00:10:03.931
grammar, punctuation, and all those

00:10:03.931 --> 00:10:05.400
great rules that you've learned

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.878
in your English and reading
classes in high school.

00:10:09.878 --> 00:10:13.456
So that's a bit of an
overview of the writing test,

00:10:13.456 --> 00:10:16.542
and now I'll move onto how you can

00:10:16.542 --> 00:10:19.212
mark up the writing and language test,

00:10:19.212 --> 00:10:20.752
and the reason I'm talking about

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:22.847
marking up the writing and language test

00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:26.088
is that being proactive is a great

00:10:26.088 --> 00:10:28.268
tool not only in math and reading

00:10:28.268 --> 00:10:31.255
but also here, and so this really helps

00:10:31.255 --> 00:10:34.154
engage your mind as you're reading

00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:35.376
through the passage
and working through the

00:10:35.376 --> 00:10:37.791
questions if you are marking things up.

00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:40.878
And so there are four things
that I always suggest you try.

00:10:40.878 --> 00:10:43.682
The first is to annotate
the passage as you go.

00:10:43.682 --> 00:10:46.765
So this is underlining and annotating

00:10:48.684 --> 00:10:51.557
things like the topic
sentence, which is the

00:10:51.557 --> 00:10:53.623
first sentence in the paragraph,

00:10:53.623 --> 00:10:57.619
it's circling things like but or however,

00:10:57.619 --> 00:11:00.591
these kind of contrast
words that convey meaning,

00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:02.998
that sort of thing.

00:11:02.998 --> 00:11:03.965
The second thing I suggest is that

00:11:03.965 --> 00:11:05.539
you underline the question and the

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:07.896
answer choices, and why this is important

00:11:07.896 --> 00:11:09.924
is that you want to make
sure you're answering

00:11:09.924 --> 00:11:11.813
the right question, and then on the

00:11:11.813 --> 00:11:13.361
answer choices what I would call out

00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:17.444
is that one word can make
an answer choice wrong,

00:11:18.783 --> 00:11:22.391
can make a choice wrong,
make a choice wrong.

00:11:22.391 --> 00:11:25.008
And so this attention to detail

00:11:25.008 --> 00:11:29.004
and looking through each answer
choice is really important.

00:11:29.004 --> 00:11:31.371
Third thing I would suggest
is to cross out words

00:11:31.371 --> 00:11:34.307
to simplify long sentences, and it's all,

00:11:34.307 --> 00:11:37.145
this simplification is
the name of the game,

00:11:37.145 --> 00:11:39.325
and where you'll see this most often

00:11:39.325 --> 00:11:41.517
in the writing test is with something

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.816
called a prepositional phrase.

00:11:44.816 --> 00:11:47.649
And so prepositional phrases start

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:52.917
with words like like, or above, or before.

00:11:57.424 --> 00:12:02.028
So those are a few things
that you want to look out for,

00:12:02.028 --> 00:12:04.159
and by crossing out prepositional phrases

00:12:04.159 --> 00:12:07.159
you can often simplify subject-verb,

00:12:08.032 --> 00:12:10.782
subject-verb agreement sentences.

00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:13.398
It can make it much clearer what's

00:12:13.398 --> 00:12:15.364
the subject and what's the verb.

00:12:15.364 --> 00:12:16.917
Finally, I encourage you to use

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:20.416
process of elimination
and so you can cross out

00:12:20.416 --> 00:12:23.103
the letter, you can cross
out the whole thing.

00:12:23.103 --> 00:12:26.936
Really the more active
you are in crossing out

00:12:28.099 --> 00:12:30.568
things that are wrong, the better it is

00:12:30.568 --> 00:12:31.853
so that you don't use any more

00:12:31.853 --> 00:12:34.557
mental energy to go through it.

00:12:34.557 --> 00:12:37.637
So we'll get a chance to use all of these

00:12:37.637 --> 00:12:39.744
tactics in the practice problems ahead

00:12:39.744 --> 00:12:42.995
and in the practice writing
and language passage.

00:12:42.995 --> 00:12:45.423
So that's a quick overview
of what you might,

00:12:45.423 --> 00:12:48.999
what you can expect on the SAT
Writing and Language section,

00:12:48.999 --> 00:12:52.228
and a few tips for how
you can be more proactive

00:12:52.228 --> 00:12:53.862
as you're working through the passage,

00:12:53.862 --> 00:12:56.393
reading it, and doing some questions.

00:12:56.393 --> 00:12:58.062
Now we're gonna move onto some grammar,

00:12:58.062 --> 00:12:59.723
and hopefully some of this looks

00:12:59.723 --> 00:13:01.775
familiar to you, but if not, don't worry.

00:13:01.775 --> 00:13:03.839
We're gonna do a quick review and then

00:13:03.839 --> 00:13:06.110
do some practice problems to reinforce it.

00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:09.610
So let's take a look at the first concept.

00:13:10.987 --> 00:13:15.131
So subject-verb agreement
is topic number one.

00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:16.452
Now the first thing you want to remember

00:13:16.452 --> 00:13:18.005
when it comes to subject-verb agreement

00:13:18.005 --> 00:13:22.172
is that a complete sentence
or an independent clause

00:13:23.356 --> 00:13:26.439
must always have a subject and a verb

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:31.064
that agree, and the
subject, as a reminder,

00:13:31.064 --> 00:13:32.121
is the person, place, or thing

00:13:32.121 --> 00:13:34.437
that is doing or being something.

00:13:34.437 --> 00:13:36.354
And so it is the actor.

00:13:37.728 --> 00:13:41.369
(sound cutting out) the
act that's being executed,

00:13:41.369 --> 00:13:44.484
and what you want to remember
in terms of agreement

00:13:44.484 --> 00:13:47.008
is that singular subjects always go

00:13:47.008 --> 00:13:49.004
with singular verbs, and plural subjects

00:13:49.004 --> 00:13:51.343
go with plural verbs, and so this is

00:13:51.343 --> 00:13:55.120
the agreement part of the
subject-verb agreement.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.499
And this topic is one that shows up

00:13:57.499 --> 00:13:59.995
in so many different contexts within

00:13:59.995 --> 00:14:01.960
the SAT Writing and Language component,

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.771
and so it's worth refreshing and

00:14:03.771 --> 00:14:05.388
making sure that you have a good

00:14:05.388 --> 00:14:07.312
understanding of what
is a subject and verb,

00:14:07.312 --> 00:14:09.308
what is an independent clause,

00:14:09.308 --> 00:14:11.975
also what is a dependent clause,

00:14:13.125 --> 00:14:15.829
and a few tips I have when it comes

00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:18.540
to approaching subject-verb questions

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.633
are that you should find the subject

00:14:20.633 --> 00:14:23.218
of the sentence first,
then check for agreement.

00:14:23.218 --> 00:14:25.347
And so that's all about identifying

00:14:25.347 --> 00:14:28.014
the actor, and so in this case the dog

00:14:28.014 --> 00:14:32.230
is going to be your
subject, and the action

00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.730
that he, that the dog is doing is barking.

00:14:36.756 --> 00:14:39.166
And so once you know who the actor is

00:14:39.166 --> 00:14:43.295
it makes it a lot easier to narrow down,

00:14:43.295 --> 00:14:45.255
you know, does this agree or not?

00:14:45.255 --> 00:14:47.111
The next tip is one
that I mentioned before,

00:14:47.111 --> 00:14:48.921
and this is around crossing out

00:14:48.921 --> 00:14:50.704
unnecessary words to simplify.

00:14:50.704 --> 00:14:53.871
And so what I mean here is looking for

00:14:54.918 --> 00:14:56.772
prepositional phrases that separate

00:14:56.772 --> 00:14:58.223
the subject and the verb.

00:14:58.223 --> 00:14:59.848
So the dog along with the cat was

00:14:59.848 --> 00:15:02.264
convinced that it was nap time.

00:15:02.264 --> 00:15:04.861
So in this case the subject is,

00:15:04.861 --> 00:15:06.386
any thoughts on what the subject is?

00:15:06.386 --> 00:15:08.096
If you have a guess go ahead and

00:15:08.096 --> 00:15:11.763
type that in to the
text box, into the chat.

00:15:13.976 --> 00:15:16.309
The subject here is the dog.

00:15:17.576 --> 00:15:20.177
So it's just the dog, and what I can

00:15:20.177 --> 00:15:22.783
cross out is this whole part here,

00:15:22.783 --> 00:15:25.313
along with the cat, because that is a

00:15:25.313 --> 00:15:28.007
prepositional phrase and
a prepositional phrase

00:15:28.007 --> 00:15:30.010
is never the subject.

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:33.349
So prepositional phrase,
prepositional is such a long word

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:34.895
so I'm just gonna abbreviate it.

00:15:34.895 --> 00:15:39.001
And so the dog was convinced
that it was nap time.

00:15:39.001 --> 00:15:41.259
In this case I've identified that

00:15:41.259 --> 00:15:43.816
and so then we have the verb here,

00:15:43.816 --> 00:15:47.149
was convinced, and so there you have it.

00:15:48.898 --> 00:15:51.769
So these are some quick refreshers

00:15:51.769 --> 00:15:53.922
of what subject-verb
agreement is all about

00:15:53.922 --> 00:15:56.202
and you might be thinking,
okay, I got it, I got it,

00:15:56.202 --> 00:15:57.938
let's get to some practice problems.

00:15:57.938 --> 00:15:58.771
Well I agree.

00:15:58.771 --> 00:16:00.636
Let's do some practice problems,

00:16:00.636 --> 00:16:02.032
apply what we've discussed about

00:16:02.032 --> 00:16:04.567
being proactive in marking up the answers

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:07.600
and the questions, and keeping
all of these things in mind.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.489
But before that I want to throw a few

00:16:10.489 --> 00:16:11.767
questions and pronouns your way

00:16:11.767 --> 00:16:14.491
to test what is singular
and what is plural.

00:16:14.491 --> 00:16:16.241
So let's take a look.

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:20.186
So subject-verb agreement.

00:16:21.852 --> 00:16:24.335
Are these phrases singular or plural?

00:16:24.335 --> 00:16:26.024
And so we're gonna step
through each one of these,

00:16:26.024 --> 00:16:28.176
and as I'm going through, if you think you

00:16:28.176 --> 00:16:30.178
know the answer go ahead and type that in

00:16:30.178 --> 00:16:33.115
and then I'll share the
answer and why that is.

00:16:33.115 --> 00:16:36.365
So he or she, is it singular or plural?

00:16:40.006 --> 00:16:42.107
So that one is singular, and that one

00:16:42.107 --> 00:16:44.705
is more straightforward,
it's an individual.

00:16:44.705 --> 00:16:47.316
It's referring to he or she and so

00:16:47.316 --> 00:16:49.240
that one is more straightforward.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.323
But what about this next
one, anyone or each one?

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.837
Anyone or each one, is
that singular or plural?

00:17:00.872 --> 00:17:04.847
So that one is also
singular, and that's because

00:17:04.847 --> 00:17:09.017
this is what is called
an indefinite pronoun

00:17:09.017 --> 00:17:13.184
and it's one of those parts
of the English language

00:17:15.330 --> 00:17:17.258
where it actually will be helpful

00:17:17.258 --> 00:17:21.767
to memorize what pronouns
fall into this category

00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:24.468
because indefinite pronouns
are always singular

00:17:24.468 --> 00:17:27.031
even though they might sound like

00:17:27.031 --> 00:17:30.435
they're referring to
multiple or many people.

00:17:30.435 --> 00:17:31.908
So that one is also going to be singular.

00:17:31.908 --> 00:17:33.075
What about we?

00:17:34.028 --> 00:17:35.611
Singular or plural?

00:17:38.108 --> 00:17:40.776
So this one is going to be plural.

00:17:40.776 --> 00:17:43.964
And so we is referring to multiple people,

00:17:43.964 --> 00:17:47.047
and so that one probably makes sense.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.655
Now what about this next one of everyone

00:17:52.655 --> 00:17:56.822
or everybody, is that gonna
be singular or plural?

00:17:58.168 --> 00:17:59.330
And some of you all might be thinking

00:17:59.330 --> 00:18:00.482
well is it the one?

00:18:00.482 --> 00:18:02.306
Am I thinking about the one
and it should be singular

00:18:02.306 --> 00:18:03.598
or am I thinking about the every,

00:18:03.598 --> 00:18:06.943
'cause then that's talking
about lots of people.

00:18:06.943 --> 00:18:08.776
So singular or plural?

00:18:10.249 --> 00:18:12.377
This one is also going to be singular

00:18:12.377 --> 00:18:15.093
and this is an indefinite pronoun, again,

00:18:15.093 --> 00:18:17.875
and so this is another example of where

00:18:17.875 --> 00:18:21.846
memorizing that this is
an indefinite pronoun

00:18:21.846 --> 00:18:25.522
will help you with subject-verb
agreement questions

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:29.680
and making sure that you pick
the verb choice that agrees.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.470
Now what about somebody?

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:34.887
Somebody, singular or plural?

00:18:38.525 --> 00:18:40.727
That is also going to be singular.

00:18:40.727 --> 00:18:43.603
So again, we have this indefinite pronoun

00:18:43.603 --> 00:18:47.546
and so you're spotting the pattern here.

00:18:47.546 --> 00:18:48.608
And so I'll move onto the next one.

00:18:48.608 --> 00:18:51.414
The turkey as well as the chicken.

00:18:51.414 --> 00:18:55.581
Turkey as well as the
chicken, singular or plural?

00:18:57.199 --> 00:18:59.682
So this one is, yet again, singular.

00:18:59.682 --> 00:19:02.837
So turkey is the subject here and

00:19:02.837 --> 00:19:05.194
as well as the chicken is actually

00:19:05.194 --> 00:19:09.674
a prepositional, not a
prepositional phrase,

00:19:09.674 --> 00:19:13.091
but it does not create a compound subject

00:19:14.721 --> 00:19:17.267
and so all of this, the only subject

00:19:17.267 --> 00:19:20.561
in this sentence is
going to be the turkey.

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:23.061
Now last one, the James and I.

00:19:24.018 --> 00:19:25.601
Singular or plural?

00:19:29.263 --> 00:19:31.300
So this one is finally plural, and the

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:34.180
reason for that is and is a conjunction,

00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:37.513
and that and creates a compound subject,

00:19:40.033 --> 00:19:42.504
and that compound subject involves

00:19:42.504 --> 00:19:45.921
two individuals, and that is James and I,

00:19:46.986 --> 00:19:50.103
and so that is why that
is going to be plural.

00:19:50.103 --> 00:19:51.832
So now we've done some of that

00:19:51.832 --> 00:19:53.830
to kind of really give you a refresher

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.562
of some of those trickier pronouns

00:19:55.562 --> 00:19:57.484
and now we're going to
do a practice problem.

00:19:57.484 --> 00:20:00.430
Here is where, if you weren't
in full screen before,

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:02.215
it will really help so that you can

00:20:02.215 --> 00:20:04.759
read the text and read the question.

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:06.341
So let's take a look.

00:20:06.341 --> 00:20:07.452
Practice question number one.

00:20:07.452 --> 00:20:08.707
Billy, although he had a great

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:11.265
sense of timing for standup comedy,

00:20:11.265 --> 00:20:13.227
were handicapped by his poor memory.

00:20:13.227 --> 00:20:15.087
So Billy, although he had a great sense

00:20:15.087 --> 00:20:18.238
of timing for standup
comedy, were handicapped

00:20:18.238 --> 00:20:19.981
by his poor memory, and so what I want

00:20:19.981 --> 00:20:22.641
to do here is I want to find the subject.

00:20:22.641 --> 00:20:24.308
What is the subject?

00:20:26.973 --> 00:20:30.056
So that subject is going to be Billy.

00:20:31.221 --> 00:20:34.471
And so this is going to be singular and

00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:39.414
were is actually plural, and
so we have an issue here.

00:20:39.414 --> 00:20:41.675
This should be Billy was handicapped

00:20:41.675 --> 00:20:45.842
by his poor memory, and so we
have answer choice C there.

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:48.708
That does not work.

00:20:48.708 --> 00:20:51.245
Billy have been handicapped
by his poor memory,

00:20:51.245 --> 00:20:53.538
is incorrect, and were being handicapped,

00:20:53.538 --> 00:20:55.841
again, does not agree given the tense

00:20:55.841 --> 00:20:59.591
and the singular nature
of the subject there.

00:21:01.498 --> 00:21:04.415
So that was a good warmup question.

00:21:06.489 --> 00:21:08.609
Let's keep going to the next one.

00:21:08.609 --> 00:21:10.517
So with the help of the Mat-Su Regional

00:21:10.517 --> 00:21:13.025
Medical Center, middle school students

00:21:13.025 --> 00:21:17.192
in Gateway, Alaska observe
intubation and sets bones.

00:21:18.354 --> 00:21:19.985
So with the help of the Mat-Su Regional

00:21:19.985 --> 00:21:21.595
Medical Center, middle school students

00:21:21.595 --> 00:21:25.762
in Gateway, Alaska observe
intubation and sets bones.

00:21:26.806 --> 00:21:29.722
So what do you think is the subject here?

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:33.431
Because that's again, the
first step that I would take,

00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:37.014
is I would think about
what the subject is.

00:21:38.642 --> 00:21:42.809
So subject here is going to
be middle school students.

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.833
And what is the action that they're doing?

00:21:46.833 --> 00:21:51.276
So here is observe
intubation and sets bones,

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.082
and so this one, the question actually

00:21:54.082 --> 00:21:57.631
helps you out here because
this observe intubation

00:21:57.631 --> 00:22:01.034
is not underlined and so
that part has to be correct.

00:22:01.034 --> 00:22:02.800
You can't change it and
so you have to assume

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.967
that is a given, and so this
verb, is it singular or plural?

00:22:07.890 --> 00:22:10.066
Students observe.

00:22:10.066 --> 00:22:14.233
Well I've got students here,
subject, this is the subject,

00:22:15.348 --> 00:22:18.432
students there, and so this
is plural, students observe.

00:22:18.432 --> 00:22:20.599
And what about sets bones?

00:22:22.024 --> 00:22:26.291
So there that is actually
singular and that is not correct.

00:22:26.291 --> 00:22:29.554
It does not agree with this subject,

00:22:29.554 --> 00:22:33.186
which is plural over here, and so this

00:22:33.186 --> 00:22:37.060
should be middle school
students set bones.

00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:40.421
And so there I have it, answer choice D.

00:22:40.421 --> 00:22:44.790
And then all of this is a
phrase that I can cross out.

00:22:44.790 --> 00:22:46.578
So with the help of the
Mat-Su Regional Center,

00:22:46.578 --> 00:22:48.816
that is not part of the subject and so

00:22:48.816 --> 00:22:52.079
it's fair for me to
ignore that to simplify

00:22:52.079 --> 00:22:54.792
the sentence and just focus
in on the plural subject

00:22:54.792 --> 00:22:58.792
that I have here and the
verbs that I have here.

00:22:59.722 --> 00:23:00.555
Great.

00:23:00.555 --> 00:23:03.327
So those were two of
our three subject-verb

00:23:03.327 --> 00:23:05.746
agreement questions,
and now we're gonna do

00:23:05.746 --> 00:23:09.260
one final one to get some extra practice

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:10.815
and then we'll move onto the next concept

00:23:10.815 --> 00:23:13.481
and do some Q and A, and then do the

00:23:13.481 --> 00:23:15.351
writing passage with questions.

00:23:15.351 --> 00:23:17.268
So let's keep on going.

00:23:20.434 --> 00:23:23.170
Okay, so adventure
climbers like Alex Honnold

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:25.329
specializes in free solo ascents

00:23:25.329 --> 00:23:27.714
without ropes up sheer cliff faces,

00:23:27.714 --> 00:23:31.222
such as El Capitan in
Yosemite National Park.

00:23:31.222 --> 00:23:33.181
So adventure climbers like Alex Honnold

00:23:33.181 --> 00:23:34.941
specializes in free solo ascents

00:23:34.941 --> 00:23:37.877
without ropes up sheer cliff faces.

00:23:37.877 --> 00:23:42.044
So what do you think is the
subject in this sentence?

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:49.374
So we have, some of you might be thinking

00:23:50.215 --> 00:23:53.720
it is climbers, some
of you might think it's

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.932
Alex Honnold, and so actually let me,

00:23:55.932 --> 00:23:59.548
I'll mark those in a
different color there.

00:23:59.548 --> 00:24:01.631
Climbers or Alex Honnold.

00:24:02.658 --> 00:24:04.922
Now which one do you think it is?

00:24:04.922 --> 00:24:08.005
Well it's actually gonna be climbers.

00:24:09.173 --> 00:24:11.425
So your subject is climbers,
and the reason for that

00:24:11.425 --> 00:24:15.058
is this phrase, like Alex Honnold,

00:24:15.058 --> 00:24:17.412
is one of those prepositional phrases

00:24:17.412 --> 00:24:20.771
that I had mentioned, so
prepositional phrases.

00:24:20.771 --> 00:24:22.441
And prepositional phrases can never

00:24:22.441 --> 00:24:24.072
be the subject of a sentence.

00:24:24.072 --> 00:24:27.154
And so in this case it is just climbers

00:24:27.154 --> 00:24:29.773
specializes in free solo ascents,

00:24:29.773 --> 00:24:33.856
and so specializes is
going to be your verb here,

00:24:35.243 --> 00:24:37.574
and so we've got subject there and

00:24:37.574 --> 00:24:40.157
that's gonna be plural subject.

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.984
So plural, and then specializes,
is that singular or plural?

00:24:44.984 --> 00:24:46.734
Climbers specializes.

00:24:48.050 --> 00:24:50.127
So specializes is incorrect.

00:24:50.127 --> 00:24:54.960
It should be specialize,
so we gotta take that off.

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:59.127
And so there is going to be
our answer, answer choice C.

00:25:00.072 --> 00:25:01.406
The rest of this sentence is great.

00:25:01.406 --> 00:25:04.165
So free solo ascents in
El Capitan in Yosemite,

00:25:04.165 --> 00:25:05.310
great places.

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:06.805
It's a great national park.

00:25:06.805 --> 00:25:08.250
You should go if you haven't been,

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.036
but it doesn't really
matter for the grammar

00:25:11.036 --> 00:25:14.666
and accuracy of the
sentence, and so if you

00:25:14.666 --> 00:25:17.550
just focus in on the subject and the verb

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.274
and just cross out prepositional phrases

00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:21.957
and focus in on climbers here and

00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:25.812
specializes it really helps to simplify

00:25:25.812 --> 00:25:28.244
the sentence and focus
in on what the error is.

00:25:28.244 --> 00:25:31.214
And what you'll notice is
I've been doing something

00:25:31.214 --> 00:25:33.541
interesting here in
these practice problems

00:25:33.541 --> 00:25:37.111
in that I have dissected the sentence

00:25:37.111 --> 00:25:39.549
by looking at the subject,
and then I figured out,

00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:42.132
you know, is this right or not?

00:25:43.225 --> 00:25:44.495
Right or not.

00:25:44.495 --> 00:25:48.662
And then if it's been wrong
I've asked how would I fix,

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.507
how to fix, and with that it makes it

00:25:54.507 --> 00:25:56.413
a lot easier to figure out, you know,

00:25:56.413 --> 00:25:59.700
is it no change, is it
B, is it C, is it D?

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:03.283
And so knowing if it's grammatically

00:26:03.283 --> 00:26:06.068
correct or not, predicting how to fix it,

00:26:06.068 --> 00:26:08.897
and then matching to the
answer can really help.

00:26:08.897 --> 00:26:11.124
So those are the subject-verb agreement

00:26:11.124 --> 00:26:13.890
questions that we have for today

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.691
and now I'm going to move
onto sentence punctuation,

00:26:16.691 --> 00:26:19.236
and in particular within
sentence punctuation,

00:26:19.236 --> 00:26:20.830
and this really builds off of the

00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:23.397
subject-verb agreement
that we've started out with

00:26:23.397 --> 00:26:27.160
because subject and verbs, so a complete

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.649
independent clause will
have a subject and a verb

00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:31.778
and what we're about to get into,

00:26:31.778 --> 00:26:34.200
how you connect independent
and dependent clauses

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.711
depends all on your ability to figure out

00:26:36.711 --> 00:26:40.334
is this a complete
sentence by itself or not?

00:26:40.334 --> 00:26:43.450
So hopefully you're (sound
cutting out) joining us midway.

00:26:43.450 --> 00:26:46.236
Feel free to back up and watch and

00:26:46.236 --> 00:26:48.036
you'll catch up eventually.

00:26:48.036 --> 00:26:50.600
So let's look at sentence
punctuation next,

00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.166
which is another really common topic

00:26:52.166 --> 00:26:55.083
that you'll see on the SAT writing.

00:26:56.617 --> 00:27:01.445
So sentence punctuation,
and so let's take a look.

00:27:01.445 --> 00:27:03.444
The first two pieces of punctuation

00:27:03.444 --> 00:27:06.686
I'm gonna look at are the
semicolon and the period,

00:27:06.686 --> 00:27:08.317
and these, as a refresher, are used

00:27:08.317 --> 00:27:10.273
to separate two independent clauses

00:27:10.273 --> 00:27:11.999
that each have a subject and a verb.

00:27:11.999 --> 00:27:14.363
That's the definition of an independent

00:27:14.363 --> 00:27:15.623
clause or a complete sentence.

00:27:15.623 --> 00:27:18.593
You want to have a subject and a verb.

00:27:18.593 --> 00:27:22.193
An example here is Yoda
can read minds, semicolon,

00:27:22.193 --> 00:27:24.189
I hate playing card games against him!

00:27:24.189 --> 00:27:25.813
And so I'll just make this very clear

00:27:25.813 --> 00:27:28.897
and so this is an independent clause here

00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:32.089
and this is another
independent clause here.

00:27:32.089 --> 00:27:36.107
Now the next piece of
punctuation is the comma

00:27:36.107 --> 00:27:38.574
and the conjunction, and so these are used

00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:40.829
to join clauses by converting one clause

00:27:40.829 --> 00:27:42.829
into a dependent clause.

00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:46.089
An example sentence here is George Lucas

00:27:46.089 --> 00:27:49.756
is a creative genius,
comma, but Episode III

00:27:50.768 --> 00:27:52.155
was not his best work.

00:27:52.155 --> 00:27:55.557
And so that's a comma and a conjunction,

00:27:55.557 --> 00:27:59.397
and so this is going to
be your independent clause

00:27:59.397 --> 00:28:03.564
and then this is going to be
your dependent clause there.

00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:08.886
Finally I have the dash and the semicolon,

00:28:08.886 --> 00:28:11.584
and these are used to
introduce a list, quote,

00:28:11.584 --> 00:28:14.036
or explanation, and what
you want to remember

00:28:14.036 --> 00:28:15.537
is that the part of the sentence

00:28:15.537 --> 00:28:18.764
that comes before the dash or the colon

00:28:18.764 --> 00:28:21.206
must be an independent clause.

00:28:21.206 --> 00:28:23.997
An example here is Star Wars movies always

00:28:23.997 --> 00:28:26.830
start with the same phrase, colon,

00:28:28.076 --> 00:28:30.984
a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

00:28:30.984 --> 00:28:35.112
And so this first part
is an independent clause

00:28:35.112 --> 00:28:38.591
and so that's what makes
this semicolon correct,

00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:40.401
and in case you can't tell already,

00:28:40.401 --> 00:28:42.223
I'm a big Star Wars
fan, so hopefully these

00:28:42.223 --> 00:28:45.556
sentences weren't too agonizing for you.

00:28:46.689 --> 00:28:49.375
So that's a quick refresher on a few

00:28:49.375 --> 00:28:51.838
of the most important types of punctuation

00:28:51.838 --> 00:28:54.181
that you want to know how to work with and

00:28:54.181 --> 00:28:57.744
interact with on the SAT
Writing and Language test.

00:28:57.744 --> 00:28:59.149
Now we're gonna do some practice problems

00:28:59.149 --> 00:29:01.416
to apply what you've learned and

00:29:01.416 --> 00:29:03.916
see what it's like in context.

00:29:07.765 --> 00:29:09.924
Okay, so again, if you're just joining us

00:29:09.924 --> 00:29:12.228
you'll want a full screen just so you can

00:29:12.228 --> 00:29:15.886
read the question and the
sentences more easily.

00:29:15.886 --> 00:29:18.034
So President Thomas Jefferson had one

00:29:18.034 --> 00:29:20.650
slightly unusual dream, he hoped to find

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:23.718
a living woolly mammoth in
the western United States.

00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:25.645
So President Thomas Jefferson had one

00:29:25.645 --> 00:29:27.427
slightly unusual dream, he hoped to find

00:29:27.427 --> 00:29:30.570
a living woolly mammoth in
the western United States.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.805
Okay, so what I want to
do here, so I'll just

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:36.738
emphasize that, that that's a comma,

00:29:36.738 --> 00:29:39.369
is figure out what kind of
clauses I am connecting.

00:29:39.369 --> 00:29:43.536
So this is clause number one
and this is clause number two.

00:29:44.637 --> 00:29:46.262
So clause number one, is that an

00:29:46.262 --> 00:29:49.095
independent or a dependent clause?

00:29:50.146 --> 00:29:51.708
So does it have a, if it's independent

00:29:51.708 --> 00:29:53.404
it's gonna have a subject and verb

00:29:53.404 --> 00:29:56.487
by itself and be able to stand alone.

00:29:57.452 --> 00:30:01.004
So hopefully you said that
that was an independent clause.

00:30:01.004 --> 00:30:02.162
And then what about the second one?

00:30:02.162 --> 00:30:04.274
He hoped to find a living woolly mammoth

00:30:04.274 --> 00:30:06.691
in the western United States.

00:30:09.028 --> 00:30:10.576
So that one's also an independent clause

00:30:10.576 --> 00:30:14.749
and in this case, which
type of punctuation

00:30:14.749 --> 00:30:16.019
do you think works here?

00:30:16.019 --> 00:30:20.186
Is it going to be no change,
a colon, semicolon, or a dash?

00:30:26.597 --> 00:30:29.418
So in this case it's going
to be answer choice B

00:30:29.418 --> 00:30:32.682
because the second part of this sentence

00:30:32.682 --> 00:30:34.377
connects directly to the first

00:30:34.377 --> 00:30:38.377
and explains what Jefferson's
unusual dream was,

00:30:39.421 --> 00:30:42.052
and so you can, it logically follows

00:30:42.052 --> 00:30:44.667
and it is the first part of the sentence,

00:30:44.667 --> 00:30:47.885
introduces the second part, which explains

00:30:47.885 --> 00:30:49.887
the dream that he had.

00:30:49.887 --> 00:30:52.944
And so that is going to be
your answer choice there,

00:30:52.944 --> 00:30:55.495
and you'll notice that I'm
writing B in big block letters,

00:30:55.495 --> 00:30:57.906
and the reason for that
is that writing this out

00:30:57.906 --> 00:31:00.067
makes it faster to transfer answers

00:31:00.067 --> 00:31:03.400
to the bubble sheet, so faster bubbling,

00:31:04.375 --> 00:31:07.883
and it reduces the chance
of a careless mistake,

00:31:07.883 --> 00:31:10.976
reduces the chance of a careless mistake,

00:31:10.976 --> 00:31:12.958
that is, bubbling in the wrong answer

00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:15.653
and carrying the wrong one over.

00:31:15.653 --> 00:31:17.987
Chance of careless mistakes.

00:31:17.987 --> 00:31:18.823
Great.

00:31:18.823 --> 00:31:19.656
So that was one example.

00:31:19.656 --> 00:31:23.033
Let's keep on going to the next one.

00:31:23.033 --> 00:31:26.232
So this year's Shark Week
on the Discovery Channel

00:31:26.232 --> 00:31:27.964
features the rarely-seen sharks

00:31:27.964 --> 00:31:31.259
of the Cuban coral reefs; footage includes

00:31:31.259 --> 00:31:34.350
in-water and on-water
activities with sharks.

00:31:34.350 --> 00:31:38.517
And in case it's hard to
see, that is a semicolon.

00:31:40.411 --> 00:31:43.385
So this year's Shark
Week, and so here again

00:31:43.385 --> 00:31:47.552
this first clause, is it
independent or dependent?

00:31:49.385 --> 00:31:52.516
It's gonna be an independent clause.

00:31:52.516 --> 00:31:54.407
And then footage includes in-water

00:31:54.407 --> 00:31:56.549
and on-water activities with sharks.

00:31:56.549 --> 00:31:57.958
What about clause number two?

00:31:57.958 --> 00:32:02.293
Does it have a subject and
verb and can it stand alone?

00:32:02.293 --> 00:32:04.579
Yes it can, so that
one is also going to be

00:32:04.579 --> 00:32:06.734
an independent clause, and so you have

00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:08.499
two independent clauses that are related

00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:11.624
and what are the ways to
connect two independent clauses?

00:32:11.624 --> 00:32:15.228
Well we've got the period
or we've got the semicolon,

00:32:15.228 --> 00:32:18.478
or we could do a comma and conjunction.

00:32:20.392 --> 00:32:23.424
And so let's see which
one would work best here.

00:32:23.424 --> 00:32:26.034
Well semicolon, that checks out.

00:32:26.034 --> 00:32:29.878
Reefs, colon, umm,
footage includes in-water

00:32:29.878 --> 00:32:31.768
and on-water activities.

00:32:31.768 --> 00:32:32.903
I'll keep that one.

00:32:32.903 --> 00:32:34.421
That's a possibility.

00:32:34.421 --> 00:32:36.844
Semicolon and, nope.

00:32:36.844 --> 00:32:38.128
So if I have a semicolon that connects

00:32:38.128 --> 00:32:39.846
two independent clauses enough.

00:32:39.846 --> 00:32:41.679
And then reefs, comma.

00:32:42.668 --> 00:32:44.525
Well a comma by itself does not work

00:32:44.525 --> 00:32:47.400
because it needs a conjunction to be able

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.773
to connect two independent
clauses like that.

00:32:50.773 --> 00:32:54.273
So that is out, and so you're down to two.

00:32:55.314 --> 00:32:58.367
In this case I'm gonna go
with the answer choice A,

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:01.284
and the reason A is correct is that

00:33:02.374 --> 00:33:04.791
this footage actually does...

00:33:05.774 --> 00:33:07.840
So one is that these are
two independent clauses

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.213
and the second reason is that this footage

00:33:11.213 --> 00:33:14.880
doesn't tie directly
back to the rarely seen

00:33:16.599 --> 00:33:19.766
sharks directly, and so this no change

00:33:21.364 --> 00:33:23.316
and semicolon does the best job

00:33:23.316 --> 00:33:26.618
of connecting the two
clauses, but in this case

00:33:26.618 --> 00:33:29.044
I would have had to ponder a little bit

00:33:29.044 --> 00:33:32.852
about this, but in this case the semicolon

00:33:32.852 --> 00:33:36.044
does the cleanest, easiest, clearest job

00:33:36.044 --> 00:33:37.805
of separating these two
independent clauses,

00:33:37.805 --> 00:33:41.388
and so it's gonna be
answer choice A there.

00:33:43.091 --> 00:33:44.503
This is the last question, but before

00:33:44.503 --> 00:33:47.896
we get to the last question,
I want to emphasize

00:33:47.896 --> 00:33:51.744
a few things about the
approach I've been taking.

00:33:51.744 --> 00:33:54.321
As you'll see with these
sentence punctuation

00:33:54.321 --> 00:33:56.644
practice questions I've
been really focusing

00:33:56.644 --> 00:33:59.873
on figuring out what kinds
of clauses am I connecting.

00:33:59.873 --> 00:34:02.102
Am I looking at an
independent and dependent,

00:34:02.102 --> 00:34:04.908
independent and independent clause,

00:34:04.908 --> 00:34:07.289
and as you practice more you'll get

00:34:07.289 --> 00:34:09.182
better and faster at identifying

00:34:09.182 --> 00:34:11.190
what kinds of clauses you're dealing with,

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.827
and therefore what kind of punctuation

00:34:12.827 --> 00:34:15.284
would make the sentence
grammatically correct.

00:34:15.284 --> 00:34:17.083
Then similarly to before, once I know

00:34:17.083 --> 00:34:20.479
what I'm working with, I ask myself

00:34:20.479 --> 00:34:23.998
is this correct or not, and
if not, how would I fix it?

00:34:23.998 --> 00:34:25.797
And with that in mind I can then

00:34:25.797 --> 00:34:29.638
get to the final answer much more quickly.

00:34:29.638 --> 00:34:31.290
So this last one is a bit longer

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.587
and so get ready, but don't worry.

00:34:33.587 --> 00:34:35.798
You follow all the exact same processes

00:34:35.798 --> 00:34:37.869
and like I mentioned before,
if you have questions,

00:34:37.869 --> 00:34:40.433
feel free to add them into the

00:34:40.433 --> 00:34:43.933
YouTube chat and I'll answer them shortly.

00:34:46.211 --> 00:34:47.217
So last one.

00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:49.874
Contrary to the popular perception

00:34:49.874 --> 00:34:53.957
that DNA was Watson and
Crick's discovery, colon,

00:34:55.938 --> 00:34:58.430
its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:34:58.430 --> 00:35:01.180
were first recognized by a woman,

00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.680
and that one is a semicolon,

00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:08.508
the English chemist Rosalind Franklin.

00:35:08.508 --> 00:35:10.443
So I've got three clauses here.

00:35:10.443 --> 00:35:12.858
Contrary to the popular
perception that DNA

00:35:12.858 --> 00:35:14.209
was Watson and Crick's discovery.

00:35:14.209 --> 00:35:16.285
This is clause number two, and I've got

00:35:16.285 --> 00:35:18.368
clause number three here.

00:35:21.183 --> 00:35:25.763
What am I working with
with clause number one?

00:35:25.763 --> 00:35:28.930
So that's gonna be a dependent clause.

00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:32.925
So I don't have a, the reason I know

00:35:32.925 --> 00:35:37.405
that is one, the clause
starts out with contrary,

00:35:37.405 --> 00:35:40.155
and I don't have a subject there.

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.500
So then what about number two?

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.501
Its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:35:44.501 --> 00:35:46.869
were first recognized by a woman.

00:35:46.869 --> 00:35:48.853
Is that an independent
or dependent clause?

00:35:48.853 --> 00:35:50.747
Does it have a complete subject and

00:35:50.747 --> 00:35:53.497
verb and can it stand on its own?

00:35:55.331 --> 00:35:58.691
So that one is a perfectly
fine complete sentence,

00:35:58.691 --> 00:36:00.169
and so that's gonna be
an independent clause.

00:36:00.169 --> 00:36:01.449
And what about number three?

00:36:01.449 --> 00:36:04.786
The English chemist Rosalind Franklin.

00:36:04.786 --> 00:36:06.670
So I definitely have a subject there

00:36:06.670 --> 00:36:07.986
but I don't have a verb, and so

00:36:07.986 --> 00:36:10.740
that's gonna be a dependent clause.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:13.617
And so now in terms of connecting

00:36:13.617 --> 00:36:17.035
this dependent and independent clause,

00:36:17.035 --> 00:36:20.912
what about this first,
clauses one and two?

00:36:20.912 --> 00:36:23.222
Well I've got a dependent and independent,

00:36:23.222 --> 00:36:26.389
and so, and I have a conjunction here,

00:36:27.578 --> 00:36:30.668
and so I think a comma will
serve me quite well there.

00:36:30.668 --> 00:36:32.689
So contrary to the popular perception

00:36:32.689 --> 00:36:36.470
that DNA was Watson and
Crick's discovery, comma,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:38.370
its helical structure
and phosphate backbone

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.715
were first recognized by a woman.

00:36:40.715 --> 00:36:44.130
And so that's an independent
and a dependent clause.

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:47.683
Can I connect these two, can I connect

00:36:47.683 --> 00:36:52.431
an independent and dependent
clause with a semicolon?

00:36:52.431 --> 00:36:55.764
You cannot, but I could use a colon here

00:37:00.729 --> 00:37:03.296
since the English
chemist Rosalind Franklin

00:37:03.296 --> 00:37:05.963
is explaining who this woman is,

00:37:07.514 --> 00:37:10.508
and this, we mentioned,
was an independent clause,

00:37:10.508 --> 00:37:12.026
and so I want to look for an answer

00:37:12.026 --> 00:37:15.445
that has a comma and a semicolon.

00:37:15.445 --> 00:37:19.646
And so discovery, comma,
its helical structure

00:37:19.646 --> 00:37:21.336
and phosphate backbone
were first recognized

00:37:21.336 --> 00:37:24.307
by a woman, semicolon, so that's out.

00:37:24.307 --> 00:37:25.643
We said that that was wrong.

00:37:25.643 --> 00:37:28.060
So comma and semicolon, boom.

00:37:29.221 --> 00:37:31.304
There is my final answer.

00:37:32.192 --> 00:37:34.166
So as you saw, I kinda broke down

00:37:34.166 --> 00:37:37.131
all of the clauses here and then

00:37:37.131 --> 00:37:40.965
figured out what I needed to
correctly connect all of them.

00:37:40.965 --> 00:37:44.306
And so that question had a little more

00:37:44.306 --> 00:37:46.146
text involved, it was a little trickier,

00:37:46.146 --> 00:37:49.366
but if you kind of break down the sentence

00:37:49.366 --> 00:37:52.594
piece by piece, be really
active as you go through it,

00:37:52.594 --> 00:37:56.879
you can really simplify
and, even if it looks

00:37:56.879 --> 00:38:00.105
complicated at first, you can
get to the right final answer.

00:38:00.105 --> 00:38:03.558
So now I'm gonna do a few questions,

00:38:03.558 --> 00:38:07.141
and before I jump into
the writing passage.

00:38:08.096 --> 00:38:10.301
So if you have questions
feel free to throw them

00:38:10.301 --> 00:38:15.065
in there, into the chat, and
I'll get to as many as I can.

00:38:15.065 --> 00:38:15.898
Let's see.

00:38:17.845 --> 00:38:19.847
Is it necessary to read and annotate

00:38:19.847 --> 00:38:21.342
parts of the passage that have

00:38:21.342 --> 00:38:23.559
no questions directed to them?

00:38:23.559 --> 00:38:26.142
Great question and, you know,
you're probably thinking,

00:38:26.142 --> 00:38:28.694
well if there are no
questions underlined in the,

00:38:28.694 --> 00:38:29.865
if there are no questions in that part

00:38:29.865 --> 00:38:32.131
of the passage do I need
to pay as much attention?

00:38:32.131 --> 00:38:34.651
And I would actually
say the answer is yes,

00:38:34.651 --> 00:38:36.389
and the reason for that is that there are

00:38:36.389 --> 00:38:39.513
questions in the SAT
Writing and Language test

00:38:39.513 --> 00:38:42.684
that depend on the context,
and almost all of them

00:38:42.684 --> 00:38:44.048
actually depend on the context,

00:38:44.048 --> 00:38:45.524
and in particular, questions like

00:38:45.524 --> 00:38:48.169
should you add or delete this sentence,

00:38:48.169 --> 00:38:52.005
or sentence seven should
best be placed where?

00:38:52.005 --> 00:38:54.521
All of those questions rely on the context

00:38:54.521 --> 00:38:57.480
of the paragraph and of the passage,

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.508
and so if you've skipped over or

00:38:59.508 --> 00:39:01.259
kind of glossed over those parts

00:39:01.259 --> 00:39:03.301
you won't have that critical piece

00:39:03.301 --> 00:39:05.230
of information that will actually

00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:08.071
help you answer the question about

00:39:08.071 --> 00:39:09.662
adding or deleting a sentence,

00:39:09.662 --> 00:39:11.839
moving a sentence, so on and so forth.

00:39:11.839 --> 00:39:13.021
So absolutely.

00:39:13.021 --> 00:39:15.735
You should definitely be paying attention

00:39:15.735 --> 00:39:17.143
even if the part of the passage

00:39:17.143 --> 00:39:21.060
isn't underlined as having
a question about it.

00:39:22.538 --> 00:39:24.656
Okay, how do you suggest we practice

00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:27.064
how to speed our test taking pace?

00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:29.260
So there are a few things
I would suggest there.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.687
The first would be to go on Khan Academy

00:39:32.687 --> 00:39:35.392
Official SAT Practice and after you finish

00:39:35.392 --> 00:39:39.475
three writing, evidence-based
reading and writing

00:39:40.356 --> 00:39:42.875
practice sessions you'll be able to unlock

00:39:42.875 --> 00:39:45.867
a timed mini section, and so these are

00:39:45.867 --> 00:39:49.886
timed 11-question writing
or reading passages

00:39:49.886 --> 00:39:52.779
where on Khan Academy the timer

00:39:52.779 --> 00:39:55.049
will tick down, and so that's a great way

00:39:55.049 --> 00:39:57.399
to pace yourself through one passage.

00:39:57.399 --> 00:40:00.164
The second way I would
suggest you practice

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:01.863
your timing and pacing is by doing a

00:40:01.863 --> 00:40:05.151
full length practice test, and if you find

00:40:05.151 --> 00:40:09.318
that you mainly have problems
in the writing section,

00:40:10.426 --> 00:40:12.443
practice those full writing sections,

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:14.564
have a timer, you know, kind of calculate

00:40:14.564 --> 00:40:18.147
if you have 35 questions
and four passages,

00:40:19.051 --> 00:40:21.471
35 divided by four is gonna be roughly

00:40:21.471 --> 00:40:23.535
nine minutes per passage and so that

00:40:23.535 --> 00:40:25.870
can be a good mental
model, and so practicing

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:27.366
that pacing from start to finish

00:40:27.366 --> 00:40:29.204
would be the second
way that I would do it,

00:40:29.204 --> 00:40:30.457
and so the more practice you have

00:40:30.457 --> 00:40:32.250
with the real timer, the better

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:35.398
and faster you're going to be.

00:40:35.398 --> 00:40:36.231
Let's see.

00:40:40.629 --> 00:40:42.766
How should we write our essay?

00:40:42.766 --> 00:40:44.095
Like what format would be best?

00:40:44.095 --> 00:40:45.621
Maybe a five paragraph essay.

00:40:45.621 --> 00:40:49.473
So great question, and
so when it comes to the

00:40:49.473 --> 00:40:54.072
essay I wouldn't focus
purely on the structure.

00:40:54.072 --> 00:40:55.634
I think if you are comfortable with

00:40:55.634 --> 00:40:58.255
a five paragraph essay and you've gotten

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:59.984
used to that in class, that is completely

00:40:59.984 --> 00:41:02.402
okay to use, but what you want to focus on

00:41:02.402 --> 00:41:04.203
with the SAT Writing and Language Essay

00:41:04.203 --> 00:41:08.446
is to really, to not restate
what the author is saying,

00:41:08.446 --> 00:41:11.415
because every SAT write essay prompt

00:41:11.415 --> 00:41:14.731
will focus on, will ask you to dissect

00:41:14.731 --> 00:41:17.815
how the author makes his or her argument

00:41:17.815 --> 00:41:21.140
using evidence, using persuasive elements

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:22.848
and stylistic elements, and so you really

00:41:22.848 --> 00:41:26.579
want to focus more on
answering that prompt

00:41:26.579 --> 00:41:29.426
and saying, and articulating what pieces

00:41:29.426 --> 00:41:33.343
in the author's writing
reinforces his or her point

00:41:33.343 --> 00:41:36.823
and how that is done in the essay.

00:41:36.823 --> 00:41:38.935
And you can actually go and practice

00:41:38.935 --> 00:41:41.066
writing an essay on Official SAT Practice,

00:41:41.066 --> 00:41:42.327
and we have an essay practice where

00:41:42.327 --> 00:41:45.204
you can do some pre-writing,
do some writing,

00:41:45.204 --> 00:41:47.373
and then we'll actually generate a score

00:41:47.373 --> 00:41:50.260
for your essay to tell you where

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.770
your strengths and weaknesses are.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:54.616
So that's all the time we
have for questions now,

00:41:54.616 --> 00:41:58.783
so I'm gonna jump over to
doing the practice passage.

00:42:00.288 --> 00:42:01.412
We're going to go through as many

00:42:01.412 --> 00:42:05.091
questions as we can before we wrap up.

00:42:05.091 --> 00:42:07.477
Let's take a look now at the context

00:42:07.477 --> 00:42:09.977
of a real SAT writing passage.

00:42:14.895 --> 00:42:18.134
Okay, so again here it
will be really important

00:42:18.134 --> 00:42:21.817
to zoom in as I'm reading the passage.

00:42:21.817 --> 00:42:25.067
So the Political Power of First Ladies.

00:42:28.068 --> 00:42:30.361
A high-profile, unelected
official with the

00:42:30.361 --> 00:42:33.221
political resources to
influence domestic policy,

00:42:33.221 --> 00:42:34.970
the President of the
United States has a wife,

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:39.137
known as the First Lady,
occupies a unique position.

00:42:41.414 --> 00:42:43.644
Many First Ladies, not content with simply

00:42:43.644 --> 00:42:45.499
playing the role of demure wife

00:42:45.499 --> 00:42:47.951
and social hostess, have
taken an active role

00:42:47.951 --> 00:42:50.234
in the political sphere.

00:42:50.234 --> 00:42:52.732
And I'm gonna go back to there.

00:42:52.732 --> 00:42:54.803
Even though her power
comes by way of marriage

00:42:54.803 --> 00:42:57.268
rather than from the
electorate or Constitution,

00:42:57.268 --> 00:42:58.994
the First Lady or First Gentleman

00:42:58.994 --> 00:43:00.652
has a responsibility to capitalize

00:43:00.652 --> 00:43:02.258
on her situation and attempt to

00:43:02.258 --> 00:43:05.714
create significant, lasting change.

00:43:05.714 --> 00:43:07.571
If the President of the
United States is female,

00:43:07.571 --> 00:43:10.585
her husband's title
would be First Gentleman.

00:43:10.585 --> 00:43:12.182
Throughout US history, there have been

00:43:12.182 --> 00:43:14.222
a number of influential,
politically engaged

00:43:14.222 --> 00:43:16.364
First Ladies from whom future First Ladies

00:43:16.364 --> 00:43:18.838
or Gentlemen can take inspiration.

00:43:18.838 --> 00:43:21.033
Great, so we're talking about First Ladies

00:43:21.033 --> 00:43:23.074
and First Gentlemen and their obligation

00:43:23.074 --> 00:43:26.383
to be politically engaged and create

00:43:26.383 --> 00:43:28.983
positive change, and
I've started the first

00:43:28.983 --> 00:43:31.252
and last sentence 'cause those tend

00:43:31.252 --> 00:43:35.257
to be really important to helping
me understand the passage.

00:43:35.257 --> 00:43:37.281
So Abigail Adams, the second First Lady

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.966
in American history, was first to assume

00:43:39.966 --> 00:43:43.231
a protruding role in the political sphere.

00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:45.946
Unlike her predecessor, Martha Washington,

00:43:45.946 --> 00:43:48.449
Adams was outspoken, well-educated,

00:43:48.449 --> 00:43:50.172
and quickly developed the reputation

00:43:50.172 --> 00:43:52.261
of a staunch partisan defender

00:43:52.261 --> 00:43:53.855
after openly criticizing Congress

00:43:53.855 --> 00:43:57.046
for not declaring war on France in 1798.

00:43:57.046 --> 00:43:58.543
Her influence is so well known

00:43:58.543 --> 00:44:00.575
that opponents claimed the President

00:44:00.575 --> 00:44:04.676
refused to make any appointments
without her approbation,

00:44:04.676 --> 00:44:08.093
and aspiring politicians
sought her endorsement.

00:44:08.093 --> 00:44:09.874
In recent years, Adams has become

00:44:09.874 --> 00:44:11.871
a popular topic for
biographers because of her

00:44:11.871 --> 00:44:15.371
thoughts on gender, slavery, and politics.

00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:19.603
Okay, so we're talking
about Abigail Adams here

00:44:19.603 --> 00:44:21.966
in the second part and her achievements.

00:44:21.966 --> 00:44:24.352
And so we'll just read
to that point for now

00:44:24.352 --> 00:44:27.777
because of time and we'll
tackle the first question here.

00:44:27.777 --> 00:44:30.437
I'll zoom in a little bit
more so that you can see it.

00:44:30.437 --> 00:44:32.525
So question one of 11.

00:44:32.525 --> 00:44:35.325
And so you might be wondering,
well what is the question?

00:44:35.325 --> 00:44:39.245
Well this is what's called
a stemless question,

00:44:39.245 --> 00:44:40.644
and what you want to do here is go back

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:43.036
and find the number one in the passage,

00:44:43.036 --> 00:44:45.869
which is right here, and with that

00:44:49.445 --> 00:44:50.923
determine whether you would make

00:44:50.923 --> 00:44:52.912
no change or if there is a change

00:44:52.912 --> 00:44:55.141
that would need to be made to either

00:44:55.141 --> 00:44:57.517
strengthen the
communication in the passage

00:44:57.517 --> 00:44:59.354
or fix a grammatical error.

00:44:59.354 --> 00:45:01.306
So if you recall, we started this session

00:45:01.306 --> 00:45:03.292
by saying those were the two main

00:45:03.292 --> 00:45:04.994
types of questions you can get,

00:45:04.994 --> 00:45:06.932
and so let's look at question number one

00:45:06.932 --> 00:45:09.349
and then we'll read some
of the context and see.

00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:12.179
So high profile elected official

00:45:12.179 --> 00:45:14.870
with the political resources
to influence domestic policy,

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:16.418
the President of the United States

00:45:16.418 --> 00:45:18.270
has a wife, known as the First Lady,

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.585
occupies a unique position.

00:45:20.585 --> 00:45:24.369
So can any of you, so first question.

00:45:24.369 --> 00:45:26.452
Is there an error or not?

00:45:29.418 --> 00:45:31.097
So hint, there is an error.

00:45:31.097 --> 00:45:33.429
So it is not no change, but can any of you

00:45:33.429 --> 00:45:36.512
spot what the error is in number one?

00:45:41.013 --> 00:45:44.534
It is what's called a modifier error,

00:45:44.534 --> 00:45:46.856
and what that means is
that we're talking about

00:45:46.856 --> 00:45:50.023
the First Lady here, so a high-profile

00:45:52.911 --> 00:45:54.750
unelected official, that's the First Lady,

00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.498
and then we also followed up with,

00:45:56.498 --> 00:45:59.233
known as the First Lady,
and so what's odd here

00:45:59.233 --> 00:46:00.898
is that we have all of these phrases

00:46:00.898 --> 00:46:03.867
about the First Lady and then phrase one

00:46:03.867 --> 00:46:06.813
says the President of the
United States has a wife.

00:46:06.813 --> 00:46:09.336
Well all modifiers should be placed

00:46:09.336 --> 00:46:13.110
very close to, as close as possible to

00:46:13.110 --> 00:46:16.767
the object they're describing for clarity,

00:46:16.767 --> 00:46:18.341
because in this case we're talking about

00:46:18.341 --> 00:46:20.383
the First Lady but then we have

00:46:20.383 --> 00:46:23.185
the President right here,
and so it makes it confusing.

00:46:23.185 --> 00:46:24.313
Are we talking about the First Lady

00:46:24.313 --> 00:46:27.078
or are we talking about the President?

00:46:27.078 --> 00:46:29.438
And so in this case, the way you would

00:46:29.438 --> 00:46:32.512
correct this is with answer choice D,

00:46:32.512 --> 00:46:34.750
because it focuses on the wife

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:37.515
of the President of the United States,

00:46:37.515 --> 00:46:40.993
whereas in answer choice
C, the United States'

00:46:40.993 --> 00:46:44.474
President has a wife, we're
again focusing on the President.

00:46:44.474 --> 00:46:47.443
And then in answer choice
B we're talking about

00:46:47.443 --> 00:46:49.594
the United States, which
is not even a person.

00:46:49.594 --> 00:46:52.922
And so this is, the error here is a

00:46:52.922 --> 00:46:56.096
modifier placement error,
and so answer choice D

00:46:56.096 --> 00:46:57.268
clarifies that by--

00:46:57.268 --> 00:46:58.393
(sound cutting out)

00:46:58.393 --> 00:46:59.450
Let's take a--

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.964
(sound cutting out)

00:47:01.964 --> 00:47:04.231
The First Lady has a
responsibility to capitalize

00:47:04.231 --> 00:47:06.381
and create significant, lasting change.

00:47:06.381 --> 00:47:07.735
And then if the President
of the United States

00:47:07.735 --> 00:47:10.628
is female, here husband's
title would be First Gentleman.

00:47:10.628 --> 00:47:11.715
Throughout history there have been

00:47:11.715 --> 00:47:13.358
a number of influential
and politically engaged

00:47:13.358 --> 00:47:15.290
First Ladies from whom future First Ladies

00:47:15.290 --> 00:47:17.767
or Gentlemen can take inspiration.

00:47:17.767 --> 00:47:19.166
So the first question you want to answer

00:47:19.166 --> 00:47:21.265
is should this be kept or deleted,

00:47:21.265 --> 00:47:23.136
because if you look at
the answer choices here

00:47:23.136 --> 00:47:26.024
we've got two keeps and two deletes.

00:47:26.024 --> 00:47:27.611
And so if you can make that decision,

00:47:27.611 --> 00:47:30.491
it cuts out half of the options,

00:47:30.491 --> 00:47:32.673
and what I like to ask myself here

00:47:32.673 --> 00:47:36.006
is does sentence number two, does it add

00:47:39.846 --> 00:47:43.679
something meaningful or
not, is it repetitive?

00:47:47.338 --> 00:47:51.066
And does it add relevant information?

00:47:51.066 --> 00:47:52.836
And so those are some of the questions

00:47:52.836 --> 00:47:55.480
that I like to ask myself
when I make this decision,

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.989
and so we have, if the
President of the United States

00:47:57.989 --> 00:47:59.867
is female her title
will be First Gentleman,

00:47:59.867 --> 00:48:03.722
and so to me that is an interesting point,

00:48:03.722 --> 00:48:06.380
but it's also something that we have here,

00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:08.205
First Lady or First Gentleman.

00:48:08.205 --> 00:48:10.554
So we mention it, so it is repetitive.

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:13.664
That's one strike for deleting it.

00:48:13.664 --> 00:48:15.463
And then the next thing I want to ask is

00:48:15.463 --> 00:48:16.713
is it relevant?

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:21.842
It does relate to the passage,

00:48:21.842 --> 00:48:24.845
but here we talk about
creating significant

00:48:24.845 --> 00:48:28.595
lasting change, and then
in the last sentence

00:48:29.738 --> 00:48:31.600
we talk about influential and politically

00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.837
engaged First Ladies,
and making an impact.

00:48:34.837 --> 00:48:38.054
And so it's not super relevant to making

00:48:38.054 --> 00:48:41.103
that point of lasting
change and political impact.

00:48:41.103 --> 00:48:44.719
And so that gives me
confidence that we should

00:48:44.719 --> 00:48:48.136
not keep it, and so here we have deleted,

00:48:49.214 --> 00:48:50.538
because it it interrupts the introduction

00:48:50.538 --> 00:48:51.901
of the passage's main argument

00:48:51.901 --> 00:48:54.455
with a loosely related detail.

00:48:54.455 --> 00:48:55.857
Delete it because it weakens the passage's

00:48:55.857 --> 00:48:57.466
influence on the importance of work

00:48:57.466 --> 00:49:00.988
done by several influential First Ladies.

00:49:00.988 --> 00:49:04.801
Well C is the closest
to what I was discussing

00:49:04.801 --> 00:49:08.436
because it does interrupt the main point,

00:49:08.436 --> 00:49:12.973
and it is a loosely related
detail but not significant.

00:49:12.973 --> 00:49:13.815
Great.

00:49:13.815 --> 00:49:16.536
So now let's look at number three.

00:49:16.536 --> 00:49:19.085
Which choice is most consistent with the

00:49:19.085 --> 00:49:22.211
writer's position as
established in the passage?

00:49:22.211 --> 00:49:25.628
Most consistent, so this, if we look back

00:49:26.893 --> 00:49:29.122
at number three, Abigail Adams,

00:49:29.122 --> 00:49:30.866
the second First Lady in America,

00:49:30.866 --> 00:49:33.053
was the first to assume a protruding role,

00:49:33.053 --> 00:49:35.367
so we're looking here.

00:49:35.367 --> 00:49:37.879
Unlike her predecessor,
Adams was outspoken,

00:49:37.879 --> 00:49:40.433
well-educated, and quickly developed

00:49:40.433 --> 00:49:43.445
a reputation of a staunch
partisan defender,

00:49:43.445 --> 00:49:46.362
and so this is all pretty positive.

00:49:48.881 --> 00:49:51.765
A protruding role, and
so this is essentially

00:49:51.765 --> 00:49:55.771
a way of asking, what does
protruding mean in context

00:49:55.771 --> 00:49:59.988
or what might substitute
within for protruding?

00:49:59.988 --> 00:50:02.905
So I'm gonna say a influential role

00:50:04.903 --> 00:50:07.486
would be my guess, influential.

00:50:08.703 --> 00:50:11.773
And so let's see which one matches that.

00:50:11.773 --> 00:50:14.363
Most consistent with
the writer's position,

00:50:14.363 --> 00:50:16.145
and so the writer's position actually,

00:50:16.145 --> 00:50:18.083
this question is actually not asking

00:50:18.083 --> 00:50:20.800
what could go in place of number three,

00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:24.973
but what most fits within
the author's meaning

00:50:24.973 --> 00:50:28.408
and intent within the
rest of the paragraph?

00:50:28.408 --> 00:50:30.738
And it's pretty positive, influential,

00:50:30.738 --> 00:50:33.585
and it's a pretty positive regard.

00:50:33.585 --> 00:50:37.752
So protruding, does that mean
influential and positive?

00:50:39.602 --> 00:50:40.435
Well sort of.

00:50:40.435 --> 00:50:42.584
Protruding means kind of standing out,

00:50:42.584 --> 00:50:44.482
but it has a bit of a
negative connotation,

00:50:44.482 --> 00:50:47.332
so a bit negative, and so
I don't think it's that

00:50:47.332 --> 00:50:48.984
but I won't cross it off yet.

00:50:48.984 --> 00:50:53.151
And then what about
obstrusive, an obstrusive one?

00:50:55.102 --> 00:50:57.448
So again, let's say maybe you didn't know

00:50:57.448 --> 00:50:59.407
what that meant, and so
I'll skip that for now.

00:50:59.407 --> 00:51:01.321
What about a prominent one?

00:51:01.321 --> 00:51:02.834
Prominent does mean influential

00:51:02.834 --> 00:51:05.225
and it is pretty positive, so that one

00:51:05.225 --> 00:51:07.101
has two checks in its favor.

00:51:07.101 --> 00:51:08.768
An ostentatious one.

00:51:10.110 --> 00:51:11.193
Ostentatious.

00:51:13.576 --> 00:51:16.246
So this one also does not fit, but say

00:51:16.246 --> 00:51:17.957
you didn't know what that meant and

00:51:17.957 --> 00:51:19.793
you only had this to go off of.

00:51:19.793 --> 00:51:22.379
Well in this case you should always guess

00:51:22.379 --> 00:51:24.755
because there is no guessing penalty,

00:51:24.755 --> 00:51:26.520
and so even if you have it down to this

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.806
and you're thinking, well
maybe this one isn't it

00:51:28.806 --> 00:51:30.115
so go ahead and cross that one out,

00:51:30.115 --> 00:51:31.694
and then you're left with these three.

00:51:31.694 --> 00:51:34.568
If you're getting a
pretty strong signal from

00:51:34.568 --> 00:51:36.111
the smiley face and two checks

00:51:36.111 --> 00:51:39.601
that this does fit with
the writer's position

00:51:39.601 --> 00:51:42.204
with regard to Abigail
Adams, then go ahead

00:51:42.204 --> 00:51:45.501
and select C and in that case
you would have been right,

00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:49.607
because an obstrusive,
obstrusive actually means

00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:52.369
something very similar to protruding,

00:51:52.369 --> 00:51:56.536
so it kind of sticks out, but
kind of in a negative way.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:51:59.583
And then ostentatious is another word

00:51:59.583 --> 00:52:03.583
that kinda means braggy,
or showy, and so it has

00:52:04.727 --> 00:52:06.458
some negative connotations, and so

00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:09.188
that would have been out as well.

00:52:09.188 --> 00:52:11.855
So I'll do one more question and

00:52:12.708 --> 00:52:15.269
then we'll wrap it up because of time.

00:52:15.269 --> 00:52:16.353
But let's take a look.

00:52:16.353 --> 00:52:17.985
So number four.

00:52:17.985 --> 00:52:19.833
So this is a stemless question again,

00:52:19.833 --> 00:52:21.369
so I want to look at question number four.

00:52:21.369 --> 00:52:23.702
Should it be changed or not?

00:52:25.117 --> 00:52:26.817
And so let's see.

00:52:26.817 --> 00:52:30.351
So you had a protruding
role and her influence

00:52:30.351 --> 00:52:32.377
is so well known that opponents claim

00:52:32.377 --> 00:52:35.888
the President refused
to make any appointments

00:52:35.888 --> 00:52:37.447
without her approbation, and aspiring

00:52:37.447 --> 00:52:39.240
politicians sought her endorsement.

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.035
And so this is a verb,
and so her influence

00:52:42.035 --> 00:52:45.863
is so well known is this,
is any change needed?

00:52:45.863 --> 00:52:49.696
Is there any kind of
grammatical error at all?

00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:53.879
Well I think there is,
because if you notice

00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:57.130
the tenses of the rest of the sentence

00:52:57.130 --> 00:53:00.302
are claimed, in the past tense, refused,

00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:03.589
in the past tense,
sought, in the past tense,

00:53:03.589 --> 00:53:05.787
yet is is in the present tense.

00:53:05.787 --> 00:53:08.537
So I think what would fix this is

00:53:09.866 --> 00:53:13.449
was, and so her influence
was so well known

00:53:15.138 --> 00:53:19.305
that all of these politicians
helped her and admired her.

00:53:20.692 --> 00:53:23.609
Great, so that is a glimpse at what

00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:26.617
the SAT Writing and Language section

00:53:26.617 --> 00:53:29.430
looks like within the
context of a real passage,

00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:32.377
and what I want to emphasize there is that

00:53:32.377 --> 00:53:35.573
the context of the passage,
so all of the parts

00:53:35.573 --> 00:53:37.955
before and after the underlined portions,

00:53:37.955 --> 00:53:41.152
are very important for
you to pay attention to

00:53:41.152 --> 00:53:44.342
because they inform the
answer of all of the

00:53:44.342 --> 00:53:46.120
questions that you're prompted and what

00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.342
you need to look into in
the underlined portion,

00:53:49.342 --> 00:53:51.479
and so I know we didn't
get through all of it,

00:53:51.479 --> 00:53:55.547
but if you want more
practice with this passage

00:53:55.547 --> 00:53:58.799
and those like it go to
Official SAT Practice

00:53:58.799 --> 00:54:01.677
and do those practice sessions either

00:54:01.677 --> 00:54:05.258
untimed if you're just
starting out, or do them timed

00:54:05.258 --> 00:54:08.396
so that you can simulate
the real situation.

00:54:08.396 --> 00:54:10.009
Now the last thing I'll share with you

00:54:10.009 --> 00:54:13.158
is an SAT badge, a Khan Academy badge

00:54:13.158 --> 00:54:15.222
for attending this class, and so go ahead

00:54:15.222 --> 00:54:18.656
and look in the chat room and we'll be

00:54:18.656 --> 00:54:21.769
sharing a link to a badge that you can get

00:54:21.769 --> 00:54:23.581
for attending this
class, and what you'll do

00:54:23.581 --> 00:54:26.448
is click on the link, head to Khan Academy

00:54:26.448 --> 00:54:29.827
and then log in, and once
you log in you'll see

00:54:29.827 --> 00:54:32.450
in the top right hand
corner of your screen

00:54:32.450 --> 00:54:34.498
a notification pop-up that says,

00:54:34.498 --> 00:54:38.387
hey you've got the Khan
Academy SAT Writing badge.

00:54:38.387 --> 00:54:40.581
And so I'll leave you with that,

00:54:40.581 --> 00:54:43.548
and for those of you who are taking

00:54:43.548 --> 00:54:47.343
the SAT this Saturday,
a few tips I would share

00:54:47.343 --> 00:54:49.938
is just to relax ahead of the test.

00:54:49.938 --> 00:54:52.473
Don't stress out, don't try and cram

00:54:52.473 --> 00:54:54.708
10 practice tests before then.

00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:56.942
What's most important right now is

00:54:56.942 --> 00:55:00.667
really getting enough rest, eating well,

00:55:00.667 --> 00:55:03.864
and preparing all the
materials. and admission ticket,

00:55:03.864 --> 00:55:06.027
and pencils that you need for test day.

00:55:06.027 --> 00:55:07.706
Don't try and do any crazy cramming

00:55:07.706 --> 00:55:11.247
before Saturday because you've just got

00:55:11.247 --> 00:55:13.030
a few days left and it can often be

00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:14.995
counterproductive to stress yourself out.

00:55:14.995 --> 00:55:17.325
On Khan Academy in our
Tips and Strategies section

00:55:17.325 --> 00:55:19.060
we also have a number of articles

00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:21.297
for what you should be
doing the week before,

00:55:21.297 --> 00:55:23.123
and the day before, and how you can

00:55:23.123 --> 00:55:25.873
get ready in those last 24 hours.

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:28.008
If you're taking the test this Saturday,

00:55:28.008 --> 00:55:29.804
best of luck to you, and for those who

00:55:29.804 --> 00:55:31.595
have been with us over the course of these

00:55:31.595 --> 00:55:34.047
three classes, I hope this has been

00:55:34.047 --> 00:55:36.130
helpful for you, and I know it's been fun

00:55:36.130 --> 00:55:38.225
for me and all of us at Khan Academy,

00:55:38.225 --> 00:55:40.196
so thanks so much for joining us

00:55:40.196 --> 00:55:44.026
