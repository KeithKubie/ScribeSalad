00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
&gt;&gt; Sean: You've got this guy, Bill Tutte, with his
team of people - or the team of people who

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.610
he was working with - and they have cracked
this code. Why do they need computers?

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.990
Where did Colossus come in?
&gt;&gt; DFB: Colossus came in because 
the sheer amount of counting

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.619
that you had to do was enormous. You were
basically, in the end, looking for the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:32.009
occurrences of dots (or zeros) in, well 
41 * 31 *  5 times whatever [settings to try out] ...

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.239
You know, you might be able to afford to get the
whole Research Section doing just one

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.190
little bit of it, but day in day out? All
you wanted to do was to look for

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.539
patterns and count out the number of
zeros within them. And you need a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.610
computer! It doesn't matter if it's a
special-purpose computer - which Colossus was.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.449
When they first realized this they
tried to go back to Enigma-type

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.879
technology: "Oh! we understand about relays
and uniselectors. let's build something

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.199
electromechanical". It was called Heath
Robinson, and for those of you in North

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.729
America Heath Robinson is the direct
[UK] equivalent of Rube Goldberg.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.659
They were both cartoonists that drew
impossibly complicated electromechanical

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.570
machines, and made cartoons, out of them
So, there's this huge amount of stuff to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.580
be counted up but electro-mechanically,
when they tried to do it, it couldn't go

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.530
fast enough. It would take days. And they
tried to speed the machines up and they

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.900
just went up in blue smoke. And
eventually I think Alan Turing had

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.079
worked with Tommy Flowers from Dollis
Hill GPO [General Post Office]. He'd worked

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.840
with them for some aspects of the Enigma
decode but as we know [for] Enigma

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.899
electromechanical was just about OK.
But Turing said: "Why not let's get

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.950
in Flowers for an opinion and Max Newman
who was by then head of Research Section, said:

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.960
"All right, bring him in and we'll have a chat. And 
Flowers took one look at it and said: "You will

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.600
never get it fast enough to do what you
want electromechanically. Forget it!

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.470
We've got to go electronic and use valves".
And of course there was a huge [outcry]: "Flowers

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.620
are you off your head?! We all know valves, they go 'bang'

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.459
every few minutes! They're not reliable." 
I think I've said this before [but]  I'll say it

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.860
again:  Tommy said to them "I've been doing
research on use of thermionic valves in

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.739
telephone exchanges and I can tell you
they can be remarkably reliable so long

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.140
as you never turn them off". And it's
particularly the heaters on the cathodes.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.780
If you bring those up to voltage very
quickly so they instantly go red or

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.840
white hot the filament will [often] go 'bang', 
but if you bring them up very carefully, from

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.549
dull red to bright red, and all that... 
And then, at the end of the day, don't switch

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:56.099
them all off. Lower the voltage and do
that very very carefully. You will

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:02.459
minimize the number of thermionic valve
blowouts you get and so, basically, the

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.890
message was 'Never ever turn them off and
it'll be fine'. And in the end it was. And

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.610
the electronic speeds were just about
enough. But it still took ... a typical run

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.260
on Colossus to discover Initial Settings
on a pair of wheels might take 10

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.639
minutes, something like that. And you've
got to do that for five different pairs.

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.709
So, y'know you're taking about an hour
to work out settings, if you didn't know

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.060
them alread. Standing Orders said: 'You
must never take more than two hours'. If

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.139
you haven't got it sorted by then, on the
settings, give up [and] go to another message.

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:42.000
But then, if you knew the settings but
didn't know the wheel patterns that was

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.599
a huge amount of effort [that] was needed. In
fact Frank Carter reckons 10 hours of

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.980
Colossus time to establish what the
patterns of 1s and 0s were on the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.260
wheels. Now you've realized why they
ended up with 10 Colossi at Bletchley Park.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:03.090
They got a huge amount of work to do.
And you mustn't also run away with the idea

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.950
that Colossus could do absolutely
everything. It couldn't. The great

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.319
majority it could, but it relied on this
slight statistical disparity, there were

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.720
always more 0s than 1s. And look
for what [wheel] setting make that happen.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.669
But just occasionally a rogue message
would come in where it just happened to

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:26.170
be 50:50, and there wasn't a skew or a bias.

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.860
And then you have to throw that one away 
and say: "We'll come back to that later".

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:36.430
So it wasn't 100% but it was good
enough to make a decisive difference to

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.080
the war. Yes, it seems weird doesn't it
that it's not 50:50 between 0s and 1s?,

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.090
in a regime where we're doing
exclusive-ORs. Well, what you've got to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:51.970
remember is if you exclusive-OR
something with itself you get a bunch of

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.620
0s. But whatever it is, if you exclusive-OR
all those together, if they're identical

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.300
the exclusive-OR, on a character basis,
will be five 0s and to make those

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.610
show up at Bletchley they denoted it
with a /, if you remember.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:13.090
OK, well, that's all very well but that ...
so how would that lead to a bias, a skew ?

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.480
Answer: in many many languages, not
the least German and not the least

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.980
English which, as we must remember is a
Germanic language, you get doubled

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:32.380
letters, OK? So, Sean, if I say to you - I'm
guessing - the probability of 'z' in English

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:38.890
is 1/100 what's the probability of
getting two z's? 1/100 times 1/100?

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.570
&gt;&gt; Sean: Well, hat would be the mathematical answer
&gt;&gt; DFB: Yeah! Yeah! if they're all independent it will

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.940
be 1/10000. But they're not! Double 'z''
is far more common,  even in

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:54.190
English let alone in German. than one in 10,000. 
Really, you know, 'dazzle, 'puzzle',  all

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:57.220
these kind of things. It's not massively
common, as a bigram,

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.870
but it's more common than the base
probabilities would indicate.  Double p's

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:07.990
as well: "happy, slapping, flappy". All these
kind of things. So character doubling was

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:15.640
one of the vital components of saying
that if you look on a certain stream and

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:22.090
it's a 0, and you look on the adjacent
streams from 2 to 5 and it's a 0 as

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.840
well, then it's a null character. And that
could have been generated by having one

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:34.510
thing exclusive-ORd with it's identical
thing. So, on a bitstream basis they

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.830
adapted that and said the reason we are seeing

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:42.480
more 0s is that if you slide these
bitstreams over each other by one bit

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.669
and exclusive-OR, them you'll find that
double-letter occurrences lead

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:53.400
eventually to more 0s coming out than
1s, because on the nature of exclusive-OR,

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.510
- if something is the same as something
else and you exclusive-OR it -  it gives

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.210
0s not 1s. So, it's a bit rough and
ready and hand-wavy, there's more to it

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:10.350
than that but that is just one example
of how the language structure itself can

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.240
do you in. And it's reported that the
German cryptanalysts realized that this

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:23.130
would be a weakness of the Lorenz cipher
but they said: "We're not to worry, it

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.090
would need you to build a machine and
they'll never be able to do that. There'd be

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:32.490
so much data it will kill 'em!
You'd need roomfuls of people and even

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:37.740
within a month they wouldn't do it. But
what they didn't foresee was the advent

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.830
of machines with electronic speeds, not
just electromechanical ones, and that

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:49.840
could just about get on top of it.
