00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.680
Partnerships are a great way to maximize
or initiate distribution of your app.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.550
Partnerships can be mutually
beneficial for many companies and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.640
can be cost effective when
you're just starting out.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.450
When thinking about potential partners,
you need to think about touch points,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.340
which are the methods you use
to connect with your customers.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.020
So is it a face to face meeting,
is it through online ads, or

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.720
is it through a partnership?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.090
You'll need to figure out
the lifestyle of your customer.

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.270
And when they need to solve a problem,
you have the solution for it.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.920
For Embarkment,
our customers will be looking for

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.280
a solution to their dog sitting
needs when they are going to travel.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.640
Let's think about the behavior of a
person that goes on vacation, and where

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.130
we might find an opportunity to connect
with them, when they need us most.

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.030
This person might book his
flight online, maybe search for

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.840
a hotel or AirBnB in his destination,
and perhaps also rent a car.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.230
&gt;&gt; For example, we could consider
partnering with a travel agency to be

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.660
their preferred dogsitting service.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.460
When booking with a travel agency,
you'll have add-on options,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.040
like renting a car, booking a hotel,
flights, getting travel insurance, and

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.570
now we'll pitch them adding dogsitting.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.700
Now we need to consider why somebody
else would want to partner with us.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.600
In this case, we would be great for
a travel agency

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.700
because they're now able to offer
a more holistic booking experience and

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.740
being the one stop shop for
their customers.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:19.720
&gt;&gt; More than that,

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.840
these players are usually basing
their model on affiliate networks.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.770
So, they get a fee for each click or

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.260
conversion coming from
their site to ours.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.000
For us, it's great because they're
putting us in front of people who

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.330
are planning to travel, and

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.250
we will be paying them only for
a successful outcome.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.420
Either leads, which are clicks.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.080
Or customers, so conversions.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.240
It's a mutually beneficial relationship.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.510
&gt;&gt; Take YouTube, for example.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.090
When they were just starting out they
sought a partnership with Myspace

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.520
to host their videos, and
look where YouTube is now.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.660
You're actually watching
a YouTube hosted video right now.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.004
On that note, let's hear from
Steve Chen, a YouTube co-founder.
