00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.850
Movie fans never know just how much time,
money and energy is spent creating the next

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.940
Hollywood hit before cameras ever start rolling.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.750
But as polished or acclaimed as a script may
be, thereâ€™s no predicting what will happen

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.410
when the cast and crew arrive on set.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.900
And sometimes, lines or scenes improvised
on the spot can not only work, but become

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.900
instant classics.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.590
Here are Screen Rant's 10 Amazing Movie Scenes
That Were Completely Improvised.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.120
The Avengers: Age of Ultron
Even though the two met as enemies, Hawkeye

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.300
and Quicksilver wound up as allies by the
movie's final fight.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:49.370
But that didn't stop the archer from being
tempted to take him down.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.809
The gag was improvised by Jeremy Renner during
shooting, and was just too good to leave out.

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.380
Guardians of the Galaxy
Bradley Cooper recorded the voice for Rocket

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.430
Raccoon once filming had wrapped, but it was
director James Gunn's brother Sean who played

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.100
the mercenary on set.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.400
When the rest of the team are agreeing to
lead a suicide mission, the actor apparently

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:23.649
had his co-stars in tears - before improvising
the now famous end to the entire scene.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.499
Independence Day
Sometimes, an unscripted line can fit the

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:32.009
scene so perfectly, audiences never even think
to catch it.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.770
When Will Smith's fighter pilot is dragging
an unconscious alien across the salt flats,

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.109
he lets all his frustration out on his would-be
killer.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.820
Nobody warned the crew that Utah's Great Salt
Lake is home to millions of brine shrimp,

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.119
who rot just below the sandy crust when the
lake dries out.

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:56.109
The result: Will Smith's final outburst had
nothing to do with the alien - just the location.

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:01.609
Jurassic World
As serious as a runaway dinosaur might be,

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.700
the Jurassic Park sequel found time for plenty
of humor.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.289
But when the oddball tech Lowery decides to
play the hero (the footage leading up to everyone

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.270
else leaving the island, and him staying behind
to help the heroes), he gets shut down fast.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.040
The line was improvised, and the two playing
out the surprise reveal made it into the final

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.040
cut.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.040
The LEGO Movie
Given how famous Morgan Freeman's voice has

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040
become, it shouldn't surprise us that even
his outtakes are too good to leave out.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040
When Vitruvius is introducing Emmet to the
rest of the Master Builders, a mix-up with

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.040
Gandalf and Dumbledore leads to a quick one-liner.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.040
The line wasn't performed, but actually spoken
by Freeman to the directors during his time

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.040
in the recording booth.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Obviously, the directors found the perfect
place to fit in the glimpse of Freeman's sense

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.040
of humor.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
The Wolf of Wall Street
Matthew McConaughey has become famous for

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.950
doing everything a little bit differently,
but sometimes, his odd behavior behind the

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.280
camera makes it in front.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
When audiences first saw his character start
humming and beating his chest in a crowded

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.200
restaurant, they were just as confused as
Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.560
The ritual was one McConaughey would actually
practice before shoots.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.590
When his co-star caught it, he asked if they
could try it during the scene.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.360
Even so, you can spot DiCaprio cracking up,
and even looking to his director and crew

00:02:50.360 --> 00:03:23.900
as the ritual builds.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.650
Star Trek
The big screen reboot of Star Trek managed

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.340
to excite a new generation of moviegoers,
while doing right by fans of the original

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.730
- and Leonard Nimoy's appearance as the original
Spock was a big part of it.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.860
As proof that the classics are to be trusted,
Nimoy asked J.J. Abrams if he could improvise

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.210
his final line after seeing Kirk given command
of the Enterprise.

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.590
It was a perfect moment, sending the movie
towards its close, and letting Spock - and

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.730
Nimoy - hand the franchise off to a new generation
with a single order.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.240
True Lies
James Cameron's big-budget spy thriller had

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.240
a ton of stunts, but it was Jamie Lee Curtis'
relentless workout plan that made headlines,

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.490
insisting that she perform a sultry dance
for her on-screen husband personally.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.680
She got just as carried away as her character,
apparently, since her fall to the floor was

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.130
completely unscripted - you can even watch
as Arnold Schwarzenegger jumps up to help

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:28.659
before realizing she's pushing through, and
sliding back into the scene as best he can

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:34.650
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
Fans didn't have high hopes for the movie

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.370
reboot of the heroes in the half-shell, but
the modern Ninja Turtles kept the teenage

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.750
energy completely intact.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.819
Some of that is due to the actual actors playing
the part.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:47.279
When the producer noticed the stars goofing
around and free-styling between takes, he

00:04:47.279 --> 00:04:53.150
insisted they do the same for the actual movie.

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.749
It became one of the best scenes in the movie,
with the animators turning the improvised

00:04:56.749 --> 00:05:01.129
song into a CG masterpiece.

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.780
Captain America
Marvel relied on some risky special effects

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.259
to bring their star soldier to life prior
to his superhero rebirth.

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:14.830
But even if star Chris Evans was added onto
a smaller actor to start, the audience couldn't

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.059
prepare themselves for the musclebound super-soldier
that emerged - and neither could Evans' co-star,

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:21.080
Hayley Atwell.

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.439
The actress has admitted that she's genuinely
flustered in the scene, with her reactions,

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:28.629
and the need to actually touch Evans' pecs
all completely unscripted.

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:30.539
Can you blame her?

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.449
Those are the famous, iconic, or hilarious
movie moments that have luck and improv to

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:37.159
thank, but what favorites of yours have we
