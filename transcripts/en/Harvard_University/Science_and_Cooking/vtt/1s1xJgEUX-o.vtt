[LIQUID HISSING]

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.100
MICHAEL BRENNER: So we should start.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.620
So it's really a great pleasure
today to have the Voltaggio brothers.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.492
Clap.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:26.757
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:26.757 --> 00:00:27.590
It's really awesome.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.640
And as you see, they're going to
put on quite an exciting show.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.430
But before we start, we have a
couple of other items of business.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.410
And today actually, one of them
is here we have Professor Rob

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.520
Lue, who's in charge of HarvardX.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.290
HarvardX is the online
version of Harvard.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.904
And it's one of our most important
sponsors in this entire venture.

00:00:44.904 --> 00:00:46.320
And so we're very grateful to you.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.130
And I just asked Rob, since he's here,
if he could say a few words to you.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.998
Rob.

00:00:50.998 --> 00:00:52.059
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:53.350
ROBERT LUE: Thank you, Michael.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.880
It's really a rare moment in life
where you have so many favorites

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.160
sort of come together in one room.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.220
And I think for me this is
one of those special moments.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.480
So science and cooking
has always been, I think,

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.400
one of the paradigms for us truly
exploring the variety of places

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.370
that learning can take place.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.380
Learning takes place in the classroom.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.100
But as all of you in this
room know, learning also

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.700
takes place in the
kitchen, in the workplace,

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.500
while you're on vacation,
at every moment of the day.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.550
So one of the issues that
HarvardX really tries to tackle

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.590
is how can we create
greater opportunities

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.400
for the world across every conceivable
platform, in every conceivable setting?

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.610
So for us, it's been a great pleasure
to work so closely with Michael, Pia,

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.680
and David on the
enormous sort of efforts

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.460
that they have done in bringing
science and cooking to the world,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.170
but also bringing it to
Harvard students as well.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.660
So I think for us it
really represents one

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.200
of those great examples
of the degree to which you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.900
can apply sort of learning in
a very wide range of settings

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.620
and using a variety of approaches.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.660
So learning, I think, is one of those
things that we care deeply about.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.510
And I think Michael, Pia, and
David absolutely do that as well.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.320
As I think we'll see tonight, the
Voltaggio brothers do as well.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.020
But the other thing that I think is
incredibly powerful is creativity.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.690
And quite often when you think about
science, unfortunately many of us

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.220
think of science as all facts
and figures and nothing else.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.090
But what we also know is that
science really depends on creativity.

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.420
It depends on solving
problems under constraints

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.490
and really trying to
think outside of the box.

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.790
And I've had the privilege of
dining at both ink and VOLT,

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.270
the two restaurants that
our master chefs represent.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.000
And I have to say because
I'm in California more often

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.100
than I am in Maryland,
I've also had the privilege

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:59.630
of eating the entire
ink menu, not at once,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.360
but over four sittings with friends.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.820
And so one thing that I can also
say is that both of these chefs

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.850
really represent, not just great
cuisine, not just a great opportunity

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.340
to learn, but as I
think we'll see tonight

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.770
and as I've tasted personally,
that burst of creativity,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.490
that pushing of the envelope, that
surprise that always takes you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.860
to a different place and
changes how you view the world.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.040
So on behalf of HarvardX,
I'm truly honored

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.120
and we're all honored to
be a part of this event.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.915
Thank you.

00:03:34.915 --> 00:03:36.512
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:36.512 --> 00:03:38.220
MICHAEL BRENNER: So
now what I'm supposed

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.140
to do for the next several
minutes is talk about emulsions,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.530
which is the scientific
topic of tonight,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.050
that you will see before you in spades.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.134
In the Harvard class that accompanies
this lecture, we have a lab.

00:03:49.134 --> 00:03:50.800
Actually, the students did it last week.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.430
And the lab was basically
making mayonnaise and lime foam.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.608
And you will notice-- you all have
to clap-- this is our equation.

00:03:58.608 --> 00:03:59.770
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.770
And you see we have this bizarre
tradition, when we have these equations

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:03.436
and people clap.

00:04:03.436 --> 00:04:06.380
And it's that much humor in this.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.120
And so this is the lime
foam that is created.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.380
But what I want to talk
about is something else,

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.725
which is that yesterday was Halloween.

00:04:13.725 --> 00:04:15.350
How many of you went trick or treating?

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.600
AUDIENCE: It wasn't yesterday.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.800
MICHAEL BRENNER: Oh,
no, it wasn't yesterday.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.230
Recently, it was Halloween.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.910
So actually because it was
Halloween, if you go to CVS,

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.090
you can buy this candy
very cheaply, which I did,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.410
in preparation for this event.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.350
And here I have candy.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.072
Now, is the candy a solid or a liquid?

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:34.790
AUDIENCE: Solid.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.220
MICHAEL BRENNER: What
about if I pour it?

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.280
AUDIENCE: Solid.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.970
MICHAEL BRENNER: Now, it's a liquid.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.230
So you see if I can do that
to it, now it's a liquid.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.890
It flows.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.635
Do you notice?

00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:50.510
But now it's a solid.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.130
OK.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.750
So I'm going someplace with
this, so marbles, packing.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.550
OK.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.250
Volume fraction, that was
the equation from last week.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.180
So the volume fraction is what you do is
you take the total volume of the candy

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.870
and you divide by the volume
of space that it occupies.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.069
Now, in this candy you see the
total volume that it occupies

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:15.110
is not equal to the total volume of
the candy because there's gaps in it.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.760
There's air.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.250
There's free space.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.450
So have any of you ever entered to
count the jelly beans in a jar contest?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.890
So the reason that you
can't win-- well, there

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.830
are several reasons
why it's hard to win.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.760
One is you have to know
the volume of the jar.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.960
You're not allowed to weigh the jar.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.450
If you weigh the jar
you could always win.

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.380
Because you would weigh the jar
and then you would weigh the candy.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.184
And you would win.

00:05:33.184 --> 00:05:34.600
But you're not allowed to do that.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.810
And so what you have to do is estimate
how much free space there is in the jar

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.750
because the jar is not
densely packed with candy.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.624
And it turns out there's
a rule of thumb that

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:44.470
is very important in this regard,
which is that it turns out

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.460
that if the candy were spheres,
they were spherical objects,

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.100
then there's a number, which is
64%, which is the volume of space

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:52.390
that the candy occupies.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.660
So 36% of it is free space.

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:59.180
If it's M&amp;Ms, then it
turns out it's about 70%.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.637
So somewhere around 30%
of it is free space.

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:03.720
Now, this is very important
for tonight's lecture.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.700
I'm going to convince you guys of this.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.740
You don't have to believe me.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:06.750
But I'm going to try to convince them.

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.720
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: We're with you.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:09.010
MICHAEL BRENNER: And
this is very important.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.843
And I want to basically
tell you about this.

00:06:10.843 --> 00:06:16.117
So the point is that when the volume
fraction is less than 64% or so, then

00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:16.700
it's a liquid.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:17.550
It flows.

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:20.197
That's why when I did this--

00:06:20.197 --> 00:06:21.690
[RATTLING]

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.330
--it flowed.

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:25.580
When it's 64% or bigger, than
it has an elastic modulus.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.980
It's a solid.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.990
So you can plot the elasticity
as a function of volume fraction.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.865
And there's a critical
volume fraction, which

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:36.330
is 64%, where basically
the thing becomes a solid.

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:40.690
And as you continue to compress it above
that, it becomes more and more stiff.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.370
The reason I'm telling you this
is that the physics of emulsions

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.800
is exactly the same as what I just said.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.520
So what is the physics of emulsions?

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:50.770
So now emulsions-- I mean we're going
to see lots of emulsions in front of us.

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.960
I mean foams, cappuccino foam,
whipped cream, mayonnaise, aioli,

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.510
these are things that people, you
all, many of us cook every day.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:04.490
And the way that you cook them is
that you take some elements, often

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.390
oil and water or water and air,
with a little bit of chemical,

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:11.370
stuff like that, and you put it
in a jar and you mix it very hard,

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.600
which is presumably why you
guys have this Breville mixture

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.690
here because you're going
to mix it very hard.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.290
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: That just
give away the whole thing.

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:20.350
No surprises now.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:22.683
MICHAEL BRENNER: And notice
they've got this attachment.

00:07:22.683 --> 00:07:24.950
There's this thing which
basically is for whipping.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.375
So the question is why is it that
if you pour the stuff-- well,

00:07:27.375 --> 00:07:28.420
I don't know what you're
going to pour in there.

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.160
But whatever it is, you're
going to mix something.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.110
And what's going to
happen is that they're

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.090
going to make a foam or an emulsion.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:38.160
And if you were to take a picture
it under the microscope, what

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.160
you would see is this.

00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.330
This is a picture of Hellmann's
mayonnaise under the microscope.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.070
And what it consists of is droplets.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:47.640
There are little droplets
of oil and water.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.600
Now, we have a microscope here.

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.860
So we're prepared for your lecture.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:53.820
But can anyone tell me
what the volume fraction

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.940
is of-- first of all, is
mayonnaise a solid or a liquid?

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.240
AUDIENCE: It's a solid.

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:58.970
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's a solid.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.620
I mean, it's not a very strong solid.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:02.540
I mean if you stood on, you'd crush it.

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.300
I mean you can a paper clip
on top of it and it'll be OK.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.620
So it's sort of like a solid.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.270
And the reason that it's a solid is
because there are those droplets.

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.186
Now, can anyone tell me what the
volume fraction is of those droplets?

00:08:12.186 --> 00:08:13.000
AUDIENCE: 64%.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.530
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: 64%.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.470
So you see.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.804
So it's the same as
the candy in the jar.

00:08:17.804 --> 00:08:19.970
So what you're trying to
do is pack things together.

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:23.310
And by mixing your packing-- this is a
picture of aioli under the microscope.

00:08:23.310 --> 00:08:24.550
There are packings of little droplets.

00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.120
And you can have various
types of emulsions.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.036
There's oil and water emulsions,
where there's oil droplets and water.

00:08:29.036 --> 00:08:33.970
There's water and oil emulsions, in
which there's water droplets in oil.

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:35.841
And there are various
questions one can ask.

00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:37.049
How do you make the droplets?

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.409
Well, you're going to
watch droplets be made.

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:43.010
When that machine turns on, you can
guarantee droplets are being made.

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:46.130
It's actually amazing that it
makes them, that the thing works.

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.097
Because the droplets are
pretty small actually.

00:08:48.097 --> 00:08:51.180
And you just turn the damn thing on
and then pretty soon thereafter you've

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.084
got like 10 micron-sized droplets.

00:08:53.084 --> 00:08:54.250
And you can't even see them.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:55.380
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: That's
why your job's so easy.

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:57.810
MICHAEL BRENNER: That's
why-- well, I can't do it.

00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.790
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Just turn your mic on.

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:02.970
MICHAEL BRENNER: I mean,
in fact, what color is it?

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:07.196
So if you notice that mayonnaise
is white-- has anyone noticed that?

00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:08.320
Have you guys noticed that?

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:08.470
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.860
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.320
MICHAEL BRENNER: You
know why it's white?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.550
Does anybody know why
mayonnaise is white?

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.660
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I've made it
yellow with saffron though too.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:13.800
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.894
You can put coloring in
it and make it yellow.

00:09:15.894 --> 00:09:17.810
But does anybody know
why mayonnaise is white?

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:19.970
Because you don't start out
with white substances, right?

00:09:19.970 --> 00:09:21.260
You start out with clear substances.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.030
It ends up being white.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.685
Why is it white?

00:09:22.685 --> 00:09:23.840
AUDIENCE: It bends the light.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.910
MICHAEL BRENNER: It bends the light.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.870
Do you know what the
wavelength of light is?

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.078
AUDIENCE: You're the teacher.

00:09:28.078 --> 00:09:30.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:32.580
MICHAEL BRENNER: Does anybody
know what the wavelength

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.344
of the light in this room is?

00:09:34.344 --> 00:09:37.496
AUDIENCE: 400 to 700 nanometers.

00:09:37.496 --> 00:09:38.870
MICHAEL BRENNER: What's the unit?

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.050
AUDIENCE: Nanometers.

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.800
MICHAEL BRENNER: Well, nanometers
is-- sort of hundred of microns,

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.760
sort of hundreds of nanometers.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.210
But the point is that it has
to be that big to bend light.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.300
So these droplets are
small to bend the light.

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.174
And so they're sort of
micron-sized droplets.

00:09:51.174 --> 00:09:54.400
We'll see under the microscope,
a little bit bigger than that.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.402
So, OK, packings of droplets--
droplets, emulsion techniques.

00:09:57.402 --> 00:09:58.610
I'm giving away your lecture.

00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:59.860
Sorry.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:00.726
Droplets, moving--

00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:02.100
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'm just a cook.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.150
MICHAEL BRENNER: You're cooking.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.185
Emulsions, droplets, I'm
just showing you pictures.

00:10:05.185 --> 00:10:06.630
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: We're
actually just cooking dinner.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.526
MICHAEL BRENNER: Surfactants,
droplets, mayonnaise-- mayonnaise,

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.150
we had a mayonnaise making competition.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:11.920
This is cool.

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.490
We asked people how much mayonnaise
could you make with a single egg?

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:15.180
This was stealing an idea--

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.650
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I used to win
that in my kitchens, by the way.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:17.030
MICHAEL BRENNER: Did you always win?

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:17.520
How much did you make?

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:18.420
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, yes.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.830
I used to make a whole rib [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:20.800
I don't know if you
understand what that is.

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:22.010
It's like a Cuisinart mixer.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:22.510
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:22.760
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:23.360
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: He's cheating.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.235
He's using a machine.

00:10:24.235 --> 00:10:25.660
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: One [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.610
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You
don't have to go to the gym.

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:28.160
If you just make mayonnaise, you can--

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.495
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I would throw--
I would throw-- I would cheat.

00:10:29.495 --> 00:10:31.050
I would throw xanthan gum in there.

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:32.560
And I didn't tell anybody.

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.380
MICHAEL BRENNER: And
an interesting question

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:34.710
is how does that make it better?

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.418
But anyway, there are
too many questions.

00:10:36.418 --> 00:10:37.380
I've said enough.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.360
You all know about emulsions now.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.392
I present you the Voltaggio brothers.

00:10:41.392 --> 00:10:42.748
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:47.040
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Normally, I think
everyone usually thanks Harvard

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.890
for inviting them.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:49.090
It's a huge honor.

00:10:49.090 --> 00:10:49.690
It is for us.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.481
But we want to thank the long list
of people that weren't available

00:10:52.481 --> 00:10:56.720
to speak here tonight so that we
actually got to come and do this.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.180
So thank you for those guys that are--

00:10:59.180 --> 00:10:59.610
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Not showing up.

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.110
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Those ladies
and gentlemen that are busy.

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:05.300
Good evening, Harvard.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.198
I never thought I'd say that.

00:11:07.198 --> 00:11:08.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:10.933
My mom never thought
I'd say that either.

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:13.224
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I never
thought you'd say that either.

00:11:13.224 --> 00:11:14.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:14.070 --> 00:11:15.830
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I didn't have
to apply or pay for it either.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:16.696
So that's good.

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:19.070
We're going to try and do a
whole six course tasting menu

00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:21.219
in however much time you say we have.

00:11:21.219 --> 00:11:22.260
How much time do we have?

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:23.140
An hour.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.540
So if somebody wants to
volunteer and tell us?

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:28.140
Because we'll get lost in this and then
you guys will be here until tomorrow.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:30.431
So we want to make sure that
this-- you'll let us know.

00:11:30.431 --> 00:11:31.010
OK.

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:34.000
So the first dish is going to be a foam.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.610
To me, a foam in scientific
terms in the kitchen

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:41.730
means a fancy word that you can use for
a sauce and charge more money for it.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:46.400
It's called a foam,
easily five more dollars.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.130
That's the science behind it for us.

00:11:48.130 --> 00:11:50.270
So it's actually math.

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.610
This isn't a math lecture.

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.110
No.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:52.490
OK.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:53.070
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Economics.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:53.660
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It's not.

00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.310
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Economics.

00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:55.601
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Wrong class.

00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:58.070
You guys are in the wrong class Yeah.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.414
How to take yogurt and turn
it into a lot of money.

00:12:01.414 --> 00:12:02.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:04.250 --> 00:12:07.200
For us, a foam, I think the
easiest way to understand

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.460
it is trapping a gas
inside a liquid or a solid.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:17.980
So inside this thing is some yogurt,
some buttermilk, some roasted garlic,

00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:20.880
and a little bit of salt.
And then this is NO2.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.290
You put that in, the gas goes in.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.590
And then when we shake it up and
put it out, you get the foam.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.170
And so you're saying, well,
why would you do that?

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:33.370
Why would you do that
for this cucumber salad?

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:37.450
This dish is based on a tzatziki,
a normal dish of cucumber,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.260
yogurt, usually some lemon, some zaatar,
a delicious dish, one of my favorites.

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.200
But we take dishes like
that and we try and add

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.575
a little bit of that creative
process or creativity to it

00:12:46.575 --> 00:12:48.616
and figure out a way to
make it a little bit more

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:49.930
unique, a little bit different.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:54.490
And so with this one, we're
adding the NO2, creating the foam.

00:12:54.490 --> 00:12:56.240
And that wasn't going
to be the end of it.

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.823
And then we have to freeze everything.

00:12:57.823 --> 00:13:00.610
I mean now this stuff
is available to us too.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.490
So this is at Whole Foods I
think, in the frozen food section.

00:13:03.490 --> 00:13:09.106
You can buy liquid nitrogen.
And so if you take yogurt

00:13:09.106 --> 00:13:10.980
and you just drop it in
to the nitrogen, it's

00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:12.430
going to freeze and
turn into an ice cube.

00:13:12.430 --> 00:13:14.950
And then when you put it into your
mouth, it's going to crack your teeth.

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:18.210
And then that yogurt that you charged
all that money for, you're now

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.390
going to get sued, to pay somebody
back for the tooth that you just broke.

00:13:21.390 --> 00:13:24.190
So it's actually not
a good way to do that.

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:26.380
And so we had to figure
out a way to not get

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.302
sued when we put frozen
yogurt in front of people,

00:13:29.302 --> 00:13:30.510
without cracking their teeth.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.480
And so we add the gas to it.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.010
It turned it into a foam.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.100
We're going to extract the
foam into the nitrogen.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:38.558
And that's going to be the
dressing for the cucumber salad.

00:13:38.558 --> 00:13:40.250
So the rest of it is pretty basic.

00:13:40.250 --> 00:13:41.990
We've got some cucumbers here.

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.890
Been vacuum packed to kind of take
some of that atmosphere out of it.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:48.460
Is that pretty accurate?

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:51.932
Take some of the atmosphere
out of it, or not.

00:13:51.932 --> 00:13:55.800
It sounded fancy, right?

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.252
So this is just a cucumber
that's been vacuum packed

00:13:58.252 --> 00:13:59.710
with a little bit of its own juice.

00:13:59.710 --> 00:14:00.668
I'm going to cut it up.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.920
This is oblique.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.658
Did you know that word, oblique?

00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.060
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Well, the cool thing
is when you compress the cucumber,

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.330
it changes the structure of it.

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:13.900
It actually gives it
a different texture.

00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:14.750
It's not as crisp.

00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:16.570
But it actually has-- it's still crisp.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:17.910
But it still has a chew.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:19.660
And it's actually really delicious.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.100
It compresses the cell
walls of the vegetable

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:25.990
and actually almost juices itself.

00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:29.070
When you cut into it, it starts
to kind of ooze out a little bit.

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:31.564
And so it just tastes more
like cucumber somehow.

00:14:31.564 --> 00:14:33.480
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I
think it just looks cool.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.540
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It looks cool too.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.360
It changes the color.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:35.650
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.880
Who's ever seen a cucumber
that looks this color?

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:38.880
Don't look at the shape.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.379
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.120
This-- come on.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.200
This is Harvard.

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.820
So there's lemon oil inside the
bowl, a little bit of lemon juice.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.730
We're going to add some
acid to it, to season it.

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:53.500
A little bit of salt over
here, I've got some flake salt.

00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:57.320
And again, this is just a
basic, simple cucumber salad

00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:00.450
you can make at home if you've got
liquid nitrogen, and NO2, and all

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:04.760
that stuff sitting
around in the cabinet,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:09.340
and a really great description
of what emulsions and foams are.

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.800
If you have that too in your head,
then you can put this together at home.

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.946
So these are our cucumbers.

00:15:14.946 --> 00:15:17.820
It's seasoned a little bit of lemon
oil, some lemon juice, some salt,

00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:18.660
and some zaatar.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.090
So it's got that Middle Eastern
sort of flavor going on.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:28.200
And then I'm going to put a couple
of these into a bowl, like this.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:34.020
This bowl I actually made
in the back with some clay

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:37.160
that we took out of the
ground, underneath the school.

00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.250
Oh, we went away to Williams-Somoma
and actually bought then.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:44.910
And then here, I've got
some charred shallots.

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:50.380
And these are just shallots that I stuck
onto a cast iron pan, charred slightly.

00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.600
And then basically just vacuum packed
them with a little bit of vinegar.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.580
And so it's like a quick pickle.

00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:58.960
Do you know this word, quickle?

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.018
Have you heard that?

00:16:00.018 --> 00:16:00.994
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:00.994 --> 00:16:01.970
No.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:03.960
This is a quickle.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.814
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's Webster's
2016 word of the year.

00:16:06.814 --> 00:16:08.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:10.860
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And so
if you look up quickle,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.170
you might not find it anywhere.

00:16:14.170 --> 00:16:16.650
And the last thing is our foam.

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:21.128
So the foam, like I said, I've got
nitrogen here, liquid nitrogen here.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.955
And so basically because--

00:16:30.159 --> 00:16:31.450
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oop, my fault.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.140
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: A
little bit more salt.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.152
You know, the foam, the gas that's
been trapped inside the liquid

00:16:37.152 --> 00:16:39.360
or the solid-- in this case,
it's yogurt, buttermilk,

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.620
a little bit of lemon juice,
some salt, some roasted garlic.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.930
We're going to extract
it into the nitrogen

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.039
so that it's airy and light and fluffy.

00:16:47.039 --> 00:16:48.830
So that when we put it
onto the plate, it's

00:16:48.830 --> 00:16:51.349
not just frozen ice cubes of
yogurt that break your teeth.

00:16:51.349 --> 00:16:54.390
And I get sued and I don't get invited
back to talk about food at Harvard

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:55.600
anymore.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:59.222
So basically, right
here we've got our foam.

00:16:59.222 --> 00:17:00.290
We'll just do this.

00:17:04.749 --> 00:17:06.790
We're going to get a little
bit more air into it.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:08.470
How much of that is on my face already?

00:17:08.470 --> 00:17:08.859
Not much.

00:17:08.859 --> 00:17:10.069
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, just a little bit.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:11.140
Here, let me get you.

00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:12.079
There you go.

00:17:12.079 --> 00:17:14.829
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Do we get in
trouble if we make a mess up here?

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:16.339
We can do whatever we want?

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.119
Really?

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:17.220
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:17.550
No, no, no, no.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:18.579
I already know where that's going.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:19.049
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO:
You'll see [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:19.049 --> 00:17:20.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:20.416 --> 00:17:22.290
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I've
done this way too much.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:27.645
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh,
you'll get in trouble.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:35.100
Did you watch Gallagher, the comedian?

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.477
The front row-- I had this
conversation with him earlier.

00:17:38.477 --> 00:17:41.060
He made everyone wear trash bags
in the front row for his show

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.820
because he was always
exploding stuff [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.750
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Don't
shoot them with your foam.

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.240
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: The only problem
no one brought trash bags tonight.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.115
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.870
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So as
you can see, that's a foam.

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:55.150
And so I did my job.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.265
I can leave.

00:17:56.265 --> 00:17:57.920
You see, I made a foam.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:58.420 --> 00:17:59.630
MICHAEL BRENNER: I can't wait.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.350
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: There's
a foam right there.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.820
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Do you want
to put that on a microscope?

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:03.778
Well, not in that bowl.

00:18:03.778 --> 00:18:06.117
Here, I'll get a spoon for you.

00:18:06.117 --> 00:18:07.200
MICHAEL BRENNER: Here we--

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:08.940
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: While they're
doing the unimportant stuff--

00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:09.290
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Here--

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.480
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --I'm
going to finish my dish.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.360
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'll come around.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.330
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So
we're still on the air.

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:14.540
We're not paying attention to them.

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:14.780
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: You got it?

00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:15.440
OK.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.910
MICHAEL BRENNER: This is so great.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.320
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Is that even
calibrated, that microscope over there?

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.604
Do you calibrate microscopes?

00:18:21.604 --> 00:18:22.770
MICHAEL BRENNER: Absolutely.

00:18:22.770 --> 00:18:23.720
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: OK.

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.810
So now the foam is in
the nitrogen. There's

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:31.580
gas trapped inside of
that liquid or solid.

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:33.665
And so now I can just break that up.

00:18:33.665 --> 00:18:36.090
[CHOPPING]

00:18:36.090 --> 00:18:39.480
And it's a lot lighter than just if
I were to put the yogurt straight in,

00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:42.140
right out of the container.

00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:48.450
And so then you end up with rocks that
are edible because the air is-- right?

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:50.724
Am I pretty close?

00:18:50.724 --> 00:18:51.640
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.075
You're good.

00:18:53.075 --> 00:19:00.090
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And so I'm going
to break them up, take these rocks.

00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:08.650
Bryan, you're very quiet tonight.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:09.610
What's going on?

00:19:09.610 --> 00:19:11.940
Usually you're, like,
critiquing me by now.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.690
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'll
save that for later.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:14.810
We got a lot of courses left.

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:16.470
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And then
I've got some fresh-- I

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.680
know we're not doing too well on time.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:18.705
I just took up half the--

00:19:18.705 --> 00:19:19.370
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, we're good.

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.920
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Some fresh mint.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.740
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'm
going to step ahead, chef.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:24.566
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I've got some dill.

00:19:24.566 --> 00:19:25.482
I've got some parsley.

00:19:29.877 --> 00:19:30.960
Why is everybody so quiet?

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.149
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:34.190
Is that good when people
aren't talking in class.

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.090
I mean if you're teacher and everybody--
that means they're listening.

00:19:36.090 --> 00:19:36.150
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.570
They're listening.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:38.400
They're fascinated by what you're doing.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.566
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I'm
fascinated by what I'm doing.

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:44.650
These are cucumber flowers.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.360
We call them cuke blooms in
the street, just so you know.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.211
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.738
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: The mystery.

00:19:50.738 --> 00:19:51.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:56.086 --> 00:19:56.586
Yes.

00:19:58.871 --> 00:20:01.204
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Mom, I'm
embarrassing you at Harvard.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.250
And was that everything?

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:05.830
Yeah.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:06.996
I mean it's like a tzatziki.

00:20:06.996 --> 00:20:09.710
It's cucumbers.

00:20:09.710 --> 00:20:18.680
It's a frozen yogurt and garlic
tzatziki foam and some cuke flowers,

00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.990
cuke blooms in the street,
some dill, some fresh mint,

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:23.980
a little bit of parsley.

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:26.057
And again, I mean it's
just a cucumber salad.

00:20:26.057 --> 00:20:27.140
But that's the first dish.

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.002
So we've got a couple
more, a couple more to go.

00:20:31.002 --> 00:20:31.869
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:31.869 --> 00:20:33.910
MICHAEL BRENNER: So we
should show-- so now look,

00:20:33.910 --> 00:20:35.700
here's your foam under the microscope.

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:37.350
Watch.

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:39.320
Did you see that?

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.328
It's a bubble.

00:20:40.328 --> 00:20:41.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:41.760
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:43.090
It's sort of a thick foam.

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:43.860
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: That's
what it's supposed to be.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:44.040
Yeah.

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.650
That's exactly what it's
supposed to look like.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:47.025
MICHAEL BRENNER: But you can see.

00:20:47.025 --> 00:20:48.282
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:48.344 --> 00:20:50.010
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I was going for that.

00:20:52.146 --> 00:20:54.520
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So I'm going
to jump into the next dish.

00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.186
And actually before we get started,
I think it might be curious.

00:20:57.186 --> 00:20:58.815
I have a broken emulsion here.

00:20:58.815 --> 00:21:00.815
So I'm going to start
with a broken one and then

00:21:00.815 --> 00:21:03.091
try to repair it and see if it works.

00:21:03.091 --> 00:21:05.340
So I was wondering if you
want to take maybe some of--

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:05.660
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:06.740
We want some emulsion.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.220
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: --this and
put it on-- I don't know what

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.066
the-- is that the Petri dish, right?

00:21:12.066 --> 00:21:12.840
MICHAEL BRENNER: Just a little bit.

00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.990
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I know
it doesn't look like food.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:15.406
But it tastes it tastes like food.

00:21:15.406 --> 00:21:16.014
It does.

00:21:16.014 --> 00:21:18.305
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: And it might
be difficult to get that.

00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:20.112
Oh, I think you got both.

00:21:20.112 --> 00:21:21.727
MICHAEL BRENNER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:21.727 --> 00:21:23.060
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: We'll just see.

00:21:23.060 --> 00:21:27.480
Because then I guess you could
tell if I do my job or not.

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.277
So the next dish is-- I
think I'm going to talk

00:21:30.277 --> 00:21:31.610
a little bit about my childhood.

00:21:31.610 --> 00:21:34.540
When I was growing up, I used
to love oatmeal in the morning.

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:38.810
But I used to take oatmeal and
pour brown sugar, and more sugar,

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:41.560
and cinnamon, and all the things
that are really not good for you.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.280
And just put more and more
and more of it on there.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.360
I liked it really sweet.

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:48.230
So obviously, when you're a child,
you're craving carbohydrates and sugar.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:55.330
And as I grew up, I still love that idea
of that really luxurious porridge that

00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:57.090
was luxurious to me when I was a child.

00:21:57.090 --> 00:22:00.074
But then as I got older, I
wanted something super-savory.

00:22:00.074 --> 00:22:01.740
So I made the complete opposite of that.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:11.861
So this is a very savory porridge, made
with mushrooms, and kombu, and soy,

00:22:11.861 --> 00:22:12.860
and all of those things.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.776
Do you need some more?

00:22:13.776 --> 00:22:15.590
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:16.540
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: This
is definitely broken.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:17.780
You can tell by looking at it.

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:18.610
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Do you
guys all know each other?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:19.840
Everyone is just--

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.090
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: There you go.

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:22.447
It's horrible.

00:22:22.447 --> 00:22:24.530
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Cambridge
is a small town, huh?

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.764
Everyone just--

00:22:26.764 --> 00:22:29.680
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So to get to camera,
right, I need to move over here.

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:35.590
So in here, what I have in the porridge
is some shiitake mushrooms; again,

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:36.940
some steel-cut oats.

00:22:36.940 --> 00:22:40.980
It's been pressure cooked
with some milk too, as well.

00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:44.804
Just to crack the grain and to make it
like a really great savory porridge.

00:22:44.804 --> 00:22:45.970
And that's part's been done.

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.690
And it takes about 18
minutes in a pressure cooker

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:48.970
to make the whole thing.

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.914
And then basically that part is it.

00:22:50.914 --> 00:22:52.830
So my breakfast takes a
little bit longer now.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.460
I can't do it with quick oats.

00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.340
Then what I have here
is we have an emulsion

00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.470
that we make with yeast, beer, lemon.

00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:04.060
And then we use two hydrocolloids to
actually help emulsify and stabilize

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:05.260
a sauce.

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:09.180
And what it is is we take brown
butter and we start with that first.

00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.810
And we roast yeast
because I love the aroma

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.640
and the flavor of fresh baked bread.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:17.560
And yeast is something that
obviously plays a big part in that.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:22.827
But as a sauce, it's
compatible with beer.

00:23:22.827 --> 00:23:24.910
Because beer, obviously
fermentation and the yeast

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.451
that's developed in the beer process.

00:23:26.451 --> 00:23:30.200
By taking cake yeast or soft yeast
and roasting that in the butter,

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.087
it just really helps
to accent the sauce.

00:23:32.087 --> 00:23:34.420
Now, it's naturally starting
to come together on its own

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.980
because actually it will
emulsify on its own.

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:38.019
MICHAEL BRENNER: Look.

00:23:38.019 --> 00:23:40.310
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh, that's
completely broken, right?

00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:42.684
MICHAEL BRENNER: Oh, his is
way cooler looking than mine.

00:23:42.684 --> 00:23:43.649
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:43.649 --> 00:23:45.690
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So now
what I'm going to do is--

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:46.550
MICHAEL BRENNER: And he's [INAUDIBLE].

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:47.550
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.522
I came prepared, chef.

00:23:49.522 --> 00:23:51.980
MICHAEL BRENNER: There's even
an arrow in the middle of it.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:52.560
AUDIENCE: Is there really?

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.480
MICHAEL BRENNER: How did you do that?

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.249
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:54.249 --> 00:23:56.290
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, I
placed that in the bottom.

00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:56.960
Yeah.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:24:03.510
And so over here I have soy lecithin,
which works as not only an emulsifier,

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.870
but also it helps suspend air.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:05.370
OK.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:06.590
So I want to make bubbles.

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:08.210
I want to create bubbles in my sauce.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:10.020
But I also have xanthan
gum too because I

00:24:10.020 --> 00:24:15.820
want to thicken it slightly so I
have a better viscosity in the sauce.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.100
So that way I can get a great
mouth feel and a finish.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.796
So I'm going to try to hold this
with my belly and then-- oh.

00:24:22.796 --> 00:24:24.182
[GRINDING]

00:24:24.182 --> 00:24:30.060
And then I'm going to use the
immersion blender to help emulsify

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:32.152
the hydrocolloids into the sauce.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.050
Right now, you can't
see this, right, at all.

00:24:37.050 --> 00:24:41.180
So I need to maybe come to here.

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.295
Can we see this?

00:24:42.295 --> 00:24:42.920
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:43.753
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: OK.

00:24:43.753 --> 00:24:46.210
There we go.

00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:50.690
So now you can see
it's becoming a thicker

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:56.130
sauce as the xantham gum is starting
to bring the emulsion together.

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:59.500
Obviously, the agitation is also
helping in the emulsion too as well.

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.779
And I'm creating little bubbles.

00:25:01.779 --> 00:25:04.186
[GRINDING]

00:25:08.565 --> 00:25:10.690
And then that's going to
be almost mayonnaise-like.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:18.993
So I'm going to add a little bit
of stock to that just to thin it

00:25:18.993 --> 00:25:22.276
a little bit.

00:25:22.276 --> 00:25:23.240
There we go.

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.718
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I'm just
doing dishes, cleaning up.

00:25:26.718 --> 00:25:27.679
[GRINDING]

00:25:28.179 --> 00:25:29.640
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: There we go.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.780
OK.

00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:42.810
So the emulsion is all together now.

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:45.310
And I'm going to start to plate
because what I'm going to do

00:25:45.310 --> 00:25:47.630
is I want to froth this right before
I plate it because obviously it

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:49.940
needs to look good when
it goes out to the table.

00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.880
So I want to have this bubble
suspended in the sauce.

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:57.110
So it's more of an a la minute finish
that we do it at the restaurant.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:58.160
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: That
means at the minute.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.451
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: At the minute.

00:25:59.451 --> 00:26:01.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.682
I also have some mushrooms too.

00:26:03.682 --> 00:26:06.140
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Speaking,
today is his French class too.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.270
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So
originally what I do is

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.880
I cook the mushrooms en
papillote, which means in paper.

00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.240
And it's a classic French
cooking term that's

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.670
used to describe just putting a
bunch of things into some paper,

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.657
rolling it up, and
putting it into the oven.

00:26:17.657 --> 00:26:18.990
I don't have an oven here today.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:20.750
So what we did is we just
preroasted some mushrooms.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.960
And I'm going to warm up
lightly with some butter.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.667
And then we'll place it over the top.

00:26:24.667 --> 00:26:26.500
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So
this is that cheating.

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.083
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's called cheating.

00:26:28.083 --> 00:26:28.787
Yes.

00:26:28.787 --> 00:26:30.735
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.070
You see, I cheated.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:38.290
You see there, I cooked.

00:26:38.290 --> 00:26:39.560
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Man, look
at the paper and the way

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.050
it's like it's popped in the oven.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:44.710
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's beautiful, right?

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.420
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: En papillote,
we could say in the papillote.

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.830
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: In the papillote, yes.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:51.930
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:52.640
You guys laughed.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.425
So I mean--

00:26:56.162 --> 00:26:56.995
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: OK.

00:26:58.829 --> 00:27:01.620
So I'm going to come over here and
place some of the porridge right

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:02.745
in the middle of the plate.

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.906
I have enough for the
entire crowd it looks like.

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:24.010
Some more butter, some pepper.

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.066
We'll add a little stock here and we'll
make a quick emulsion or pan sauce.

00:27:31.814 --> 00:27:32.730
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:35.060
I read a little bit
today about emulsions

00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.470
obviously because I was
coming here to talk about it.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.880
And milk, milk is an emulsion.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:44.230
Did you know when you drink milk,
you're drinking an emulsion?

00:27:44.230 --> 00:27:45.630
I thought that was pretty cool.

00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:48.092
I just thought it was milk.

00:27:48.092 --> 00:27:51.300
So every time I'm going to have it now,
I'm going to have a glass of emulsion

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:51.800
every time.

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.850
Like, yeah, I'm going to have
a cold glass of emulsion.

00:27:54.850 --> 00:27:58.759
Put some emulsion on your
cereal, chocolate emulsion.

00:27:58.759 --> 00:28:01.550
I mean, think of all the things
you could-- milk, it's an emulsion.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.770
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I cooked the oats
with an emulsion, right, with milk.

00:28:08.770 --> 00:28:11.090
So placing some of the
mushrooms over the top.

00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:17.260
It does look a little bit-- the
presentation is a little bit greater

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:19.790
coming to the table
and cutting the paper.

00:28:19.790 --> 00:28:21.790
So I do apologize about that part.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:22.750
In fact, there's now--

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.800
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You're acting
like there's 300 people watching you.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:25.120
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.270
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I
think it looks amazing.

00:28:27.270 --> 00:28:30.270
[GRINDING]

00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:38.420
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Some more water.

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.440
Right there, yup.

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:44.940
[GRINDING]

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.940
There we go.

00:28:54.532 --> 00:28:56.240
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO:
While he's doing that,

00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.115
I didn't have any-- I
haven't had dinner yet.

00:28:58.115 --> 00:29:01.170
So I'm just going to-- can
you guys smell this out there?

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:03.710
You can, right?

00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:05.314
It's really good.

00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:06.678
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:07.177
Here.

00:29:10.251 --> 00:29:10.751
Wait.

00:29:14.347 --> 00:29:15.180
Are you guys hungry?

00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.354
It's like dinner time right now, right?

00:29:17.354 --> 00:29:21.170
And you're here, sitting down,
watching us cook, and smell our-- yeah.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:24.190
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's not fair.

00:29:24.190 --> 00:29:28.905
So this is savory oats,
with roasted wild mushrooms,

00:29:28.905 --> 00:29:36.150
an emulsion of beer, and yeast, and
butter, and some tatsoi over the top.

00:29:36.150 --> 00:29:38.816
And then that's it, as simple as that.

00:29:38.816 --> 00:29:39.772
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:40.728 --> 00:29:45.077
Now, you want to put some of the sauce
on-- I mean we'll see if I did my job.

00:29:45.077 --> 00:29:46.660
MICHAEL BRENNER: I admire the bubbles.

00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.868
We could try to put it under.

00:29:47.868 --> 00:29:49.110
But you can see the bubbles.

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.110
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.140
We don't need a microscope.

00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:53.400
MICHAEL BRENNER: We don't
even need a microscope yet.

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:53.580
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Good.

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.240
Because if I did it wrong,
I don't want to get--

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.420
MICHAEL BRENNER: I don't we're
going to be able to see through it

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:56.990
because it's too thick.

00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.930
But you can see them.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.430
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Well, I can actually--

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:00.030
MICHAEL BRENNER: Do you want to see it?

00:30:00.030 --> 00:30:00.920
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Let us see.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.628
MICHAEL BRENNER: Oh,
they want to see it.

00:30:02.628 --> 00:30:04.340
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'm curious.

00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.732
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Wait.

00:30:05.732 --> 00:30:07.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.585
Oh, yeah.

00:30:08.585 --> 00:30:09.960
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: We can see that?

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.009
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh, they're huge.

00:30:12.009 --> 00:30:12.859
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:12.859 --> 00:30:13.900
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Perfect.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.375
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I
brought my own microscope.

00:30:21.375 --> 00:30:23.630
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Hey, it worked.

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:25.272
All right.

00:30:25.272 --> 00:30:26.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:26.244 --> 00:30:27.370
Did you see that?

00:30:27.370 --> 00:30:28.058
I made bubbles.

00:30:28.058 --> 00:30:29.682
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: He made an emulsion.

00:30:29.682 --> 00:30:30.475
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:30.924 --> 00:30:31.840
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.339
Yeah.

00:30:32.339 --> 00:30:33.420
I am good at what I do.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.320
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: When
you learn how to do that?

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.209
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I had no idea.

00:30:36.209 --> 00:30:37.000
Thank you, Harvard.

00:30:39.345 --> 00:30:41.220
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I
got them to eat my meal.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:42.270
They ate my meal faster.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:43.360
They should put it up
on that [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:46.610
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: The hastags are going
be like-- oh, they're going to be good.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:48.540
They're going to be good.

00:30:48.540 --> 00:30:49.746
I can make bubbles.

00:30:49.746 --> 00:30:51.370
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: All right.

00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:52.760
Are we-- we're still cooking.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:54.080
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yes, we are.

00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:56.330
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And they're
still watching us cook.

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.860
OK.

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:59.000
The next dish.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.370
We do a dish at the
restaurant, egg yolk gnocchi.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.760
It's a gnocchi without starch.

00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.210
Everyone's gluten free now.

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:10.480
So we needed to solve that problem.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.040
And in LA, they pretty much
don't eat anything anyway.

00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.680
We're working on a water gnocchi.

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:17.700
But no one thinks that sounds delicious.

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:21.510
So for now, it's egg yolk gnocchi.

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:25.410
So I've got here in
this bag-- temperature

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:28.432
for us is something
that I think is crucial,

00:31:28.432 --> 00:31:31.640
understanding how different temperatures
work with different foods and things

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:32.210
like that.

00:31:32.210 --> 00:31:35.390
And so in this bag, we've got egg yolks.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:40.030
They've been cooked at 67
degrees Celsius for an hour

00:31:40.030 --> 00:31:42.190
and then blended with some olive oil.

00:31:42.190 --> 00:31:43.690
The olive oil is emulsified into it.

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:48.170
And the only thing that's inside of this
is actually egg yolks and olive oil.

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.770
So it's been cooked and then
blended into, like, a pudding.

00:31:51.770 --> 00:31:52.750
And that sounds good.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:54.810
I mean that's actually
what we made first.

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.055
And so that was the basis for, like,
a Bearnaise sauce or something.

00:31:58.055 --> 00:31:58.930
I thought I was cool.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:02.460
And I was spreading, like, all
this yellow stuff onto a plate

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.030
and putting pickled shallots
and tarragon on top of it.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:07.821
And again, calling it Bearnaise
and charging a lot of money for it.

00:32:07.821 --> 00:32:10.000
And so I wanted to
figure out how I could

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.950
charge more money for the egg yolks.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:12.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:14.340
Eggs are expensive.

00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.910
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Six cents.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.910
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So we
made gnocchi out of it.

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:20.607
And basically what we've
got here is, like I

00:32:20.607 --> 00:32:22.190
said, the egg yolks and the olive oil.

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:23.642
I've got a pot of boiling water.

00:32:23.642 --> 00:32:25.350
And I'm going to get
to that in a second.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.994
But the sauce-- we're
in Massachusetts, right?

00:32:30.994 --> 00:32:32.910
I was going to say Maine
because it's lobster.

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:38.430
But lobster in Massachusetts, it's
popular here because it's delicious.

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:41.790
And so I wanted to add
lobster to the dish.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.560
And then for me, lobster and drawn
butter, those two things like that's

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.710
like peanut butter and
jelly or Brian and Michael.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.914
Like those things just go together.

00:32:49.914 --> 00:32:51.080
We're more like an emulsion.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:51.996
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:32:51.996 --> 00:32:52.890
We're an emulsion.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:53.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:53.770 --> 00:32:55.980
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Two things that
don't belong together that are just--

00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:57.110
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Best.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.960
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --together.

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:00.460
Yeah.

00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.610
Thanks mom.

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:03.210
This guy-- all right.

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:07.470
So normally with stocks
or sauces, you have

00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:10.380
to reduce the sauces to be able
to emulsify the fat into it.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:12.440
Sometimes you have to
play with the temperature,

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.220
add a little bit of cold cream to it,
get it down, or find that sweet spot

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.260
to get a perfect emulsion.

00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:23.130
Now, by using xanthan gum, we can cheat.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:29.710
And so basically this power-- what
do you call it, a polysaccharide?

00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:32.430
Am I saying that
correctly, polysaccharide?

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:33.940
It's a polysaccharide.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:35.980
It's a powdered form.

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:38.330
And when it's hydrated,
it turns into like a gum.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:41.200
And so that gum enables us
to stabilize the emulsion.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:43.240
Therefore, we can do things.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:47.590
For instance, make a beurre
monte, basically emulsified butter

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:50.726
that we hold above the line and service.

00:33:50.726 --> 00:33:52.850
And so that every time you
order something from us,

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:55.210
we soak it in butter
before we serve it to you.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.606
And so the butter will usually
break halfway through the service.

00:33:58.606 --> 00:33:59.730
And then the chef comes by.

00:33:59.730 --> 00:34:00.850
He starts yelling at you.

00:34:00.850 --> 00:34:03.410
And so we found a way
to do it by stabilizing

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:05.280
the emulsion with xanthan gum.

00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:09.690
And so this is a
concentrated lobster stock.

00:34:09.690 --> 00:34:12.337
If you want the recipe--

00:34:12.337 --> 00:34:14.420
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Who'd you
serve your cucumber to?

00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:14.659
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:14.793
I don't know.

00:34:14.793 --> 00:34:15.940
We'll write a book, or no.

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:16.440
But it's--

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:18.606
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Who did
you serve your cucumber to?

00:34:18.606 --> 00:34:20.090
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I gave it away.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:20.630
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:21.810
Somebody wants my dish.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.560
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Roasted lobster--

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.720
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I don't
have a spoon though.

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.480
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: This
is roasted lobster shells.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:30.938
We've started making all of
our stocks in pressure cookers.

00:34:30.938 --> 00:34:34.730
We get a lot of the clean flavor
out of the shells faster that way.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.330
It's a purer flavor.

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:39.122
But now, instead of
having to reduce this--

00:34:39.122 --> 00:34:40.705
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I don't have a spoon.

00:34:40.705 --> 00:34:43.543
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --oh, Bryan's
playing, trying to make friends.

00:34:43.543 --> 00:34:44.036
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:44.036 --> 00:34:44.536
OK.

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.050
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: He
handed a dirty spoon

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.721
out because somebody
used the spoon water.

00:34:51.721 --> 00:34:52.929
I'm going to take that same--

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:53.389
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: There's one in back.

00:34:53.389 --> 00:34:55.888
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --immersion
blender that Bryan was using.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.800
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's clean.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.550
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO:
Bryan, this is Harvard.

00:35:06.855 --> 00:35:07.480
Is this on low?

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.835
Because if I turn this on
and it explodes, [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:09.835 --> 00:35:09.980
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:10.440
I sabotaged you.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.160
It's on high.

00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:13.750
I'm just kidding.

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.074
[GRINDING]

00:35:15.074 --> 00:35:17.240
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Does it
go-- man, this thing is--

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.031
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: They're
actually annoying.

00:35:19.031 --> 00:35:20.320
Let me assist here.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.680
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So you just-- if you
can just-- see what I'm doing, do that.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:22.890
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yes.

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:23.750
I got that.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:25.449
Like that.

00:35:25.449 --> 00:35:27.740
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I'm going
to create a little vortex.

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.350
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Actually,
you have to lose a lower one.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:30.740
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: How did
you turn it down like that?

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:31.930
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: You
use the other button.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.388
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So the xanthan--

00:35:33.388 --> 00:35:34.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:35.137 --> 00:35:37.470
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So you want
to create a vortex in there

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:40.890
so the hydrocolloid actually
goes down and the power goes down

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.610
into the emulsion, so none of it sticks
to the side of the immersion blender.

00:35:44.610 --> 00:35:44.870
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Wow.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:45.430
That's--

00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:47.800
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Because that
happens and it won't work.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.450
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Is
this your dish or my dish?

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:51.340
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: This is our dish, chef.

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.020
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: All right.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.740
So while Bryan's stealing
my ideas over here.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:00.190
So--

00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.680
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: See.

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.721
Some of it didn't get in.

00:36:01.721 --> 00:36:04.590
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So as you can
see, the stock now is thicker.

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.680
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's
coating the blender.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.980
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And so it's
going to be a lot easier for me

00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:08.730
to make the emulsion.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:10.750
I don't need to reduce
it, reduce it, reduce it.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.820
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Let me clean this.

00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:13.570
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And
so even in the old days,

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:16.900
you had to sit there and like do a
like a tablespoon of butter at a time.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:18.380
And stand over it and do this.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:19.830
And it took forever.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:21.380
And then if it didn't work, it broke.

00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:22.260
You got yelled at.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.051
And then the whole
thing was just horrible.

00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:26.710
And so we figured out a way
to just sort of eliminate

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:32.060
that part of it by-- xanthan gum
is like-- it's like baby's tears.

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:32.700
I don't know.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:34.220
They're something like--

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:34.774
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:34.774 --> 00:36:35.690
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: What?

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:37.235
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It's like a gift.

00:36:37.235 --> 00:36:38.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:44.320
I don't know it's just like something
so-- not that baby tears are--

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.612
No, that's horrible.

00:36:45.612 --> 00:36:46.570
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: There.

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:55.955
It's one of those hashtags I was
talking about earlier, right?

00:36:55.955 --> 00:36:56.829
Hastag, baby tears.

00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:57.620
Let me put that up.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.380
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And
as you can see, I'm

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:12.540
pretty sure if you put
this on the microscope

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.490
that emulsion is going to be way
more stable than Bryan's and have

00:37:15.490 --> 00:37:19.361
a much bigger airplane arrow thing
in the middle of it than Bryan's did.

00:37:21.929 --> 00:37:23.012
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, yeah?

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:28.420
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So are you
going to hit me with that?

00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.336
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:37:29.336 --> 00:37:30.384
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:30.384 --> 00:37:33.300
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So I've got my
lobster butter emulsion right there.

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.100
I'm going to add this lobster meat.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.072
I just blanched it lightly.

00:37:37.072 --> 00:37:38.780
I'm going to warm it
up inside the sauce.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:40.566
And then the next thing is the gnocchi.

00:37:40.566 --> 00:37:42.785
So, like I said, I've got
my egg yolks in olive oil.

00:37:45.719 --> 00:37:48.510
And when I was making that Bearnaise
sauce or the Hollandaise sauce

00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:51.840
on the plate, we cleaned the
spatula off one night with hot water

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.780
to make the next dish.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.810
And all of a sudden, it got hard
on the outside of the spatula.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:57.460
And the first thing I did was
get upset because I'm like,

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.850
I need the spatula right now.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:37:59.660
And the guy's cleaning it.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:01.493
And the egg is just
sticking to the outside.

00:38:01.493 --> 00:38:03.060
And I'm like, wait a second.

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:03.730
He's heating it.

00:38:03.730 --> 00:38:05.000
It's overcooking it more.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
And now it's sticking to the spatula.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.080
Go get me a pastry bag, and a
tip, and a pot of boiling water.

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:10.620
He goes.

00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.760
And this is how a lot of
the creativity happens.

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.140
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: By accident.

00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.056
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Then
by accident, I came up

00:38:17.056 --> 00:38:21.180
with this thing, which is just our
egg yolk-- is that on the-- can you?

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:23.560
Oh, man, that's terrible.

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.830
That's really embarrassing.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.760
They can't see what I'm doing.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.510
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Ah,
yeah, we can do that.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.510
Just give me one second.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:32.830
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So just pretend like
you're seeing it turning into like--

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:33.470
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: We can move this in.

00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.515
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:38:33.515 --> 00:38:33.560
No.

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:34.860
I'll take it over there
and show them after.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:35.470
They'll believe me.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:36.428
It'll will be finished.

00:38:36.428 --> 00:38:38.770
Trust me.

00:38:38.770 --> 00:38:44.570
And so basically the egg
yolks, now what I'm doing

00:38:44.570 --> 00:38:47.850
is just overcooking the outside
of it and leaving the inside of it

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:50.394
like that nice kind of pudding texture.

00:38:50.394 --> 00:38:51.810
And that's going to be my gnocchi.

00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:56.840
And so it's just egg yolks--
again, egg yolks and olive oil.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.660
We're going to-- these look pretty good.

00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:02.950
I know you can't see it.

00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:04.807
Except that one doesn't look good.

00:39:04.807 --> 00:39:06.150
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:08.780
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So
that's going to get hot.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:13.660
I've got my bowl here,
all this pretty stuff.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.300
These are sea beans, very good.

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.760
Have you ever had a sea bean?

00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:19.005
Best thing in the world,
it just taste like-- what

00:39:19.005 --> 00:39:20.195
do you think it tastes like?

00:39:20.195 --> 00:39:20.820
AUDIENCE: Salt.

00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.840
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It tastes
like salt. It's the best thing.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.260
And so these gnocchis
have like another minute.

00:39:29.260 --> 00:39:32.720
And like this sauce over here, the
thing about the xanthan gum stabilizing

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.380
the emulsion is that if it gets hot
and it starts to fall apart again,

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.130
you can just bring it
back together again.

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:42.015
Because again, we've stabilized it.

00:39:42.015 --> 00:39:43.950
You're not just relying
on the temperature

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:48.450
and getting that perfect marriage
of fat going into the liquid

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:50.370
and trying to do--
you're not doing this.

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.710
Because it's already
stuck together like this.

00:39:52.710 --> 00:39:55.940
So then when it starts like, oh, we
don't want to be together anymore,

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:57.840
you just kind of heat it up
and blend it back together.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.730
And it just goes back like.

00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:59.840
And it's an amazing thing.

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.750
I'm going to get our lobster.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.060
I brought some tweezers.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.185
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Over here.

00:40:09.751 --> 00:40:12.000
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Do you
guys eat lobster here or no?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.760
A little bit.

00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:16.360
So these are ready.

00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:24.690
And you can see it works.

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.220
It did work.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.512
OK, I was nervous because
if it didn't work,

00:40:27.512 --> 00:40:28.970
I'm was going to blame it on Bryan.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:31.066
And that would have
been awkward for him.

00:40:31.066 --> 00:40:34.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:36.052
And like the sauce is
getting pretty hot.

00:40:36.052 --> 00:40:38.010
I'm going to take it
over-- how are we on time?

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:39.575
Bryan, we have 15 minutes.

00:40:39.575 --> 00:40:41.200
MICHAEL BRENNER: You have half an hour.

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.694
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Half an hour.

00:40:43.694 --> 00:40:45.110
How come you didn't put my-- Yeah.

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:46.100
Why didn't you--

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:46.920
MICHAEL BRENNER: We
want some of that stuff.

00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:47.470
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh, this?

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:47.850
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:48.230
We want some of that.

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.230
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I mean as long as
you set something of mine on the--

00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:51.640
MICHAEL BRENNER: You
said it was an emulsion.

00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.200
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You can
touch it with your fingers.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.950
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, it is an emulsion.

00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:55.380
I mean--

00:40:55.380 --> 00:40:56.421
AUDIENCE: Oh, it cracked.

00:40:56.421 --> 00:40:58.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.382
MICHAEL BRENNER: OK.

00:40:59.382 --> 00:41:01.090
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Is
that going to work?

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:01.910
MICHAEL BRENNER: I don't know.

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:02.340
Let's see.

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:02.900
What do you think?

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.872
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Well, lecithin
is present in egg yokes.

00:41:04.872 --> 00:41:06.288
MICHAEL BRENNER: May I taste it?

00:41:06.288 --> 00:41:07.442
Um.

00:41:07.442 --> 00:41:10.650
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I was actually going
to make you the whole dish right now.

00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:11.691
MICHAEL BRENNER: Oh, wow.

00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:17.231
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So I'm
going to take the lobster.

00:41:17.231 --> 00:41:18.480
Hey lobster, where did you go?

00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.230
Oh, there you are.

00:41:19.230 --> 00:41:20.100
OK.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:22.400
So the lobster-- and
if you look at this,

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.520
it's glazed inside
the lobster stock too.

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:28.810
And so that emulsion and the
fact that it's together-- let's

00:41:28.810 --> 00:41:32.890
take the pot away, fold it over this.

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.300
The meat's perfectly glazed
inside the sauce as well.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.258
So now it's coated in,
like, that drawn butter.

00:41:37.258 --> 00:41:40.490
But the drawn butter or now the
melted butter, tastes like lobster.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:46.820
So it's like lobster, coated in lobster
butter, which-- I mean, come on Boston.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:50.978
I might come and open a
restaurant here and make this.

00:41:50.978 --> 00:41:53.330
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:53.330 --> 00:41:54.246
MICHAEL BRENNER: Look.

00:41:54.246 --> 00:41:56.697
They're lovely.

00:41:56.697 --> 00:41:57.780
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Are they?

00:41:57.780 --> 00:41:58.170
MICHAEL BRENNER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:58.170 --> 00:41:59.250
Yeah.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.060
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Does that
mean I did or did not do my job?

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:01.390
MICHAEL BRENNER: You did it.

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:02.681
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: OK, perfect,

00:42:02.681 --> 00:42:04.000
MICHAEL BRENNER: You did.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.333
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Because
that would have been awkward.

00:42:06.333 --> 00:42:06.870
OK.

00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:10.350
So a few pieces a lobster.

00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:12.801
I cooked only two whole
lobsters for the demo.

00:42:12.801 --> 00:42:15.550
I brought the knuckles tonight
because I think it's the best part.

00:42:15.550 --> 00:42:17.133
I saved the tail for tomorrow's class.

00:42:17.133 --> 00:42:18.710
Don't tell them.

00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:21.160
Honestly, I think the
knuckles are the best part.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.907
So we've got some lobster knuckle.

00:42:23.907 --> 00:42:25.990
We're going to-- do you
have a spoon I can borrow?

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:26.290
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I do.

00:42:26.290 --> 00:42:26.620
Right there.

00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:27.350
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: May
I use one of yours?

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:28.922
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Uh-uh.

00:42:28.922 --> 00:42:29.630
They're not mine.

00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:31.350
They're ours.

00:42:31.350 --> 00:42:32.210
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.126
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Ah.

00:42:35.479 --> 00:42:38.520
And so we've got some egg yolk gnocchis.

00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:45.815
Now, we've got that lobster emulsion.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.190
It's so fancy.

00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:56.071
I think we're making
fancy food right now.

00:42:56.071 --> 00:42:58.570
You know, I said earlier that
I was going to say um tonight.

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.090
And I've said like a hundred times.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:02.260
These are sea beans.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:13.566
So Michael, if you want to-- can you
help me out for one quick second?

00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:20.020
If you could just-- after
I'm finished with this,

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.164
just eat it and look at everyone
and pretend like it's really good.

00:43:23.164 --> 00:43:24.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:31.086
This is egg yoke gnocchis with a lobster
butter emulsion and some sea beans.

00:43:31.086 --> 00:43:32.536
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:33.715 --> 00:43:34.881
MICHAEL BRENNER: Absolutely.

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:41.257
It's nice.

00:43:41.257 --> 00:43:42.298
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It is?

00:43:42.298 --> 00:43:43.371
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:43.371 --> 00:43:44.287
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:43:44.287 --> 00:43:45.855
I'm just going to have one bite
and then we'll give it out.

00:43:45.855 --> 00:43:45.970
OK.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:47.344
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah, perfect.

00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.654
Let me see if he's telling the truth.

00:43:52.654 --> 00:43:53.101
MICHAEL BRENNER: No.

00:43:53.101 --> 00:43:53.730
It's really good.

00:43:53.730 --> 00:43:54.420
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh
yeah, you're right.

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:55.100
It is.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:55.980
OK.

00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:57.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.532
Wow, this emulsion is--

00:43:59.532 --> 00:44:00.990
MICHAEL BRENNER: Can I give it out?

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:02.490
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: That's really good.

00:44:02.490 --> 00:44:02.990
MICHAEL BRENNER: You have to come
back and see these people next week.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:04.240
Do you want to give it out?

00:44:09.918 --> 00:44:11.876
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You
guys have a better view.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.250
How did I cook the lobster?

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:19.930
It's a very good question.

00:44:19.930 --> 00:44:23.155
Old school, I put the
claws into a container.

00:44:23.155 --> 00:44:24.800
AUDIENCE: It's really good.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.550
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Is
it cooked perfectly?

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:32.900
So I blanched the claws and the
tails, six minutes on the claws

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.480
and three minutes on the tail.

00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:38.170
So basically what I do is I put
the claws into the bowl first.

00:44:38.170 --> 00:44:41.210
Boil water, pour it over top of it.

00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:42.112
Wait three minutes.

00:44:42.112 --> 00:44:45.070
And then the last three minutes, add
the tails to it, cover it back up.

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.720
And for some reason, I was shown
how to do this like 12 years ago.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.270
And it still blanches lobster perfectly.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:50.260
Then I take it out of it's shell.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.010
So I just want to cook it enough to
be able to get it out of the shell.

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:55.310
And then I finished it in
the lobster butter sauce.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.143
So it's warming up and
finished the cooking,

00:44:57.143 --> 00:44:59.550
without overcooking it,
right inside the sauce.

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:01.800
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Because
this emulsion isn't done yet,

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.792
all the pepper oil from
cooking jalapenos is on top.

00:45:05.792 --> 00:45:07.250
And I just took a spoonful of that.

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.830
And it's really hot.

00:45:08.830 --> 00:45:11.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.550
Did you see that, all the
oil droplets on the top?

00:45:14.550 --> 00:45:15.050
Yeah.

00:45:15.050 --> 00:45:17.930
You could see it a little bit.

00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:25.880
So since Michael went lobster,
I wanted to bring crab.

00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:29.340
Because we're from Maryland and
we have the best blue crabs.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:30.224
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:30.307 --> 00:45:31.390
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Boston.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:33.024
You're in Boston right now.

00:45:33.024 --> 00:45:35.336
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

00:45:35.336 --> 00:45:38.210
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You got to fight
for your ingredients, Jonah crab.

00:45:38.210 --> 00:45:38.460
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.820
There's some good Jonah crab here.

00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:40.570
We had some today.

00:45:40.570 --> 00:45:41.580
It's really delicious.

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:42.760
But the blue crab--

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:44.870
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I'm only doing
this because you needed the gasket out

00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:45.395
of this.

00:45:45.395 --> 00:45:46.394
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

00:45:46.394 --> 00:45:50.430
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: If this explodes
all over the place, I'm blaming you.

00:45:50.430 --> 00:45:51.930
There's a little gasket inside here.

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:52.763
We only brought one.

00:45:52.763 --> 00:45:55.110
So actually there's a good
chance this might explode

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.610
and stuff is going to go everywhere.

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.390
If that happens, it's
Bryan's fault. Good.

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.460
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So I want to do
something that looks very, very simple.

00:46:03.460 --> 00:46:05.710
Because I think for
a lot of us, we don't

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:10.480
realize that we make emulsions every
single day, every time we cook,

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.080
or at least a lot of times.

00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:17.380
So a pasta dish, just thinking
spaghetti and a marinara sauce.

00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:21.315
But if you're adding olive oil, and
butter, and some pasta water to it

00:46:21.315 --> 00:46:24.190
because you're making it correctly,
we want some of that starch water

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.040
into there.

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:27.500
That starch is going to
help create that emulsion

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.122
and make that suspended sauce that's
going to coat the pasta all over

00:46:31.122 --> 00:46:32.330
and make it really delicious.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:35.789
That way every time you're grabbing
a noodle-- I mean I know some of us

00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:37.830
take the jar of spaghetti
and you boil the pasta.

00:46:37.830 --> 00:46:39.460
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Did
you say grabbing a noodle?

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.376
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Well,
yeah, you eat a noodle.

00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:43.134
I don't know.

00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:46.300
And you boil the pasta right, and then
you put it in the middle of the bowl,

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:48.080
and then you pour the sauce on the top.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:52.260
That's not how we do it in
my house or in a restaurant.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.600
So what we do is we take-- the
pasta always goes into the pan.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:56.620
It gets tossed together.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.161
The agitation is one thing that
helps to create the emulsion.

00:46:59.161 --> 00:47:01.750
But then it's also the starch
that's coming also off the pasta

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:07.350
into the sauce, that's helping to make
that really luxurious mouth feel they

00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:08.890
we're looking for.

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:12.160
So what I have here, I started
with was just some garlic

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.540
and oil, a very, very
simple preparation;

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.590
some jalapeno for some spice.

00:47:16.590 --> 00:47:19.190
And then I'm reducing
down the crab stock

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:22.660
lightly, which we just
made with some crab bodies

00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:26.372
after we picked all the crabs
and made a stock with that.

00:47:26.372 --> 00:47:27.580
I have a few minutes to kill.

00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:29.200
That's why I'm talking because
I have to cook the pasta.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.030
And I have a minute and 44 seconds left.

00:47:31.030 --> 00:47:33.988
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: What are you going
to do for a minute ad 44 seconds?

00:47:33.988 --> 00:47:35.044
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Hm.

00:47:35.044 --> 00:47:36.960
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You're
going to look at me.

00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:40.500
There's all those good looking people
there and you want to look at me.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:41.130
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, that's right.

00:47:41.130 --> 00:47:42.450
I do have other ingredients.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:49.030
So I have some butter that--
I took uni or sea urchin roe

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:52.664
and basically just pureed the
two together, equal parts.

00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:54.330
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So that's uni butter.

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:58.849
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So a hundred grams
of uni, a hundred grams of butter.

00:47:58.849 --> 00:48:00.640
And that's going to go
right into the sauce

00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:05.890
because I'm just trying to make my
emulsion that much more difficult.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:10.780
But what's going to happen there too,
now agitation is occurring in the pan.

00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.700
There's boiling that's
occurring in the pan.

00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:15.100
So that's going to help actually
bring the emulsification together,

00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.662
and the reduction of the stock.

00:48:16.662 --> 00:48:18.370
So I don't really have
to do a whole lot.

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:20.150
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: How much
do you-- that's uni and crab.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.483
How much do you charge for that?

00:48:21.483 --> 00:48:23.241
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, a lot of money.

00:48:23.241 --> 00:48:25.189
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:26.650 --> 00:48:29.330
So as you can see, naturally
the two are starting--

00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:31.050
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: This is like
the most expensive emulsion.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:31.930
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: That's right.

00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.040
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: [INAUDIBLE] in there.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:34.040
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.210
So right now it's broken.

00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.709
OK.

00:48:35.709 --> 00:48:38.170
We went through that
with the other sauce.

00:48:38.170 --> 00:48:40.606
You can see that the oil is floating.

00:48:40.606 --> 00:48:41.730
It looks like an oil slick.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:43.313
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You call it broken.

00:48:43.313 --> 00:48:45.580
I call it like not getting along.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.050
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Not getting along.

00:48:47.050 --> 00:48:51.310
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: OK a little
therapy, a little emulsion therapy.

00:48:51.310 --> 00:48:52.160
It's not broken.

00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:52.785
You can fix it.

00:48:52.785 --> 00:48:53.660
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yes.

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:54.360
It can be fixed.

00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:58.040
But we're intentionally breaking
it to bring it back together.

00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:00.470
So it's just not happening
as fast as I want it to.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:02.380
But the pasta is almost ready.

00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:04.760
So now, the reduction is occurring.

00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.400
The fat is emulsifying into the liquid.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:10.866
I'm going to add some blue crab.

00:49:10.866 --> 00:49:13.467
I'll add that right to the pan.

00:49:13.467 --> 00:49:14.535
[BEEPING]

00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:15.410
Oh, there's my timer.

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.116
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It's ready.

00:49:17.116 --> 00:49:18.532
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: My timer is done.

00:49:22.468 --> 00:49:25.890
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to take the pasta.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:31.430
And so this is a squid ink tonnarelli.

00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:35.360
So I extruded this using a
dye with a pasta extruder.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:39.580
So basically what we do is
we take a liquid and a solid

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.270
and we push the two together
and push it through.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:44.130
You know, like we have Play-Doh.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.130
You're pushing it through
and it makes the hair.

00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:48.670
That's kind of like the same thing.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:49.650
But it's an extruder.

00:49:49.650 --> 00:49:51.280
So this agar pushes the pasta through.

00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.529
So we can make any shape we
want and we can change it.

00:49:53.529 --> 00:49:56.380
We can control the texture
of the pasta too, as well.

00:49:56.380 --> 00:49:58.142
This is squid ink.

00:49:58.142 --> 00:50:00.850
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: If you put that
on the menu, black hair pasta,

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:02.020
you think they won't buy that?

00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:02.853
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:50:02.853 --> 00:50:04.721
It would not sell.

00:50:04.721 --> 00:50:05.970
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Hair pasta?

00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:11.320
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So I'm going to
increase the temperature of the pan.

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.210
Can you-- yes, I need my pepper mill.

00:50:15.210 --> 00:50:18.350
We're going to let this all
come together to form the sauce.

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:19.580
We're also finishing--

00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.360
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Maybe you call it--

00:50:20.360 --> 00:50:21.320
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: --the
cooking of the pasta.

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.990
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --like dolly pasta?

00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:27.572
Like-- no.

00:50:27.572 --> 00:50:30.001
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I bet we could.

00:50:30.001 --> 00:50:30.500
We call it--

00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:31.583
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: No art?

00:50:31.583 --> 00:50:33.979
No one likes art in here?

00:50:33.979 --> 00:50:34.770
Who took a picture?

00:50:34.770 --> 00:50:36.490
No. no.

00:50:36.490 --> 00:50:40.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.420
There's no evidence, never happened.

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.810
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: All right.

00:50:47.810 --> 00:50:49.120
Patience is key.

00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:51.260
So reducing this down.

00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:57.077
Also I took-- well, this is
one thing that it's actually

00:50:57.077 --> 00:50:58.160
interesting to talk about.

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:00.960
So this is called "arbe."

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.890
Here's it's "obay," right?

00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:05.000
Well, I made "arbe."

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.250
Actually I had it on the menu.

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:09.210
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Is that argh, like
a pirate, or "ar," "ar" or "argh?"

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:11.210
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: And I'm
sure there's probably--

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:14.850
because your legal school here is
obviously one of the best in world.

00:51:14.850 --> 00:51:17.800
So I'm sure it was probably
somebody was a graduate here,

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.230
told me to stop calling this
"arbe." [INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.480
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: He got a
cease and desist for that.

00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.220
That's true.

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:24.428
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah, I did.

00:51:24.428 --> 00:51:26.980
That was very true.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:27.702
I listened.

00:51:27.702 --> 00:51:28.910
I'd took it get off the menu.

00:51:32.790 --> 00:51:33.290
All right.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:34.710
So now the reduction is occurring.

00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:37.910
You see-- or, well, you can't see it.

00:51:37.910 --> 00:51:38.480
OK.

00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.499
So I'm agitating the pasta and
starting to bring together the sauce.

00:51:43.499 --> 00:51:44.290
Reduction occurred.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:46.820
So we've evaporated some moisture
and water out of the dish.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.800
But then also, the
emulsing has occurred.

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.530
You can see it's suspended now.

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:51.830
It's not broken anymore.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:55.190
The starch from the pasta
started to help thicken it

00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:57.120
or thicken the liquid together.

00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.290
But then also, the fact
that we made that reduction

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:04.240
of that protein-rich stock and then
we emulsified that uni butter into it,

00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.806
it created the emulsion in the pan.

00:52:05.806 --> 00:52:07.472
MICHAEL BRENNER: So I just can't resist.

00:52:07.472 --> 00:52:08.450
I have to comment on something else.

00:52:08.450 --> 00:52:09.140
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Well, you
have come up and try this.

00:52:09.140 --> 00:52:10.050
It's really delicious.

00:52:10.050 --> 00:52:10.300
MICHAEL BRENNER: Yeah.

00:52:10.300 --> 00:52:11.060
Actually, that's what I really wanted.

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:12.768
But I also wanted to
point something out.

00:52:12.768 --> 00:52:17.190
When you were reducing
this, what left the pan?

00:52:17.190 --> 00:52:19.040
So what went up?

00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:20.131
Remember the equation.

00:52:20.131 --> 00:52:21.380
AUDIENCE: The volume fraction.

00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:22.921
MICHAEL BRENNER: The volume fraction.

00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:26.708
[APPLAUSE]

00:52:27.699 --> 00:52:30.740
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I did something I
didn't even know I was supposed to do.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.948
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: So what happened was
what went up was the volume fraction.

00:52:33.948 --> 00:52:34.730
And, um--

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:37.495
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:40.170 --> 00:52:40.959
--you get it.

00:52:44.777 --> 00:52:45.610
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: OK.

00:52:45.610 --> 00:52:48.470
So let's plate it.

00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:49.530
I may have longer tongs.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:50.904
But I got little short ones here.

00:52:50.904 --> 00:52:53.230
This will work.

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.569
So I'm just going to
spoon some of the pasta

00:52:56.569 --> 00:52:58.610
around a little nest and
place in the center of--

00:52:58.610 --> 00:52:59.010
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Isn't that hot?

00:52:59.010 --> 00:53:00.676
That's like got to burning your fingers.

00:53:00.676 --> 00:53:03.314
In front of all these
people, that's awkward.

00:53:03.314 --> 00:53:04.062
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:04.062 --> 00:53:05.145
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's hot.

00:53:05.145 --> 00:53:06.400
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Are you OK?

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.092
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah, I'm fine.

00:53:08.092 --> 00:53:10.216
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Pour
some liquid nitrogen on it?

00:53:10.216 --> 00:53:11.092
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:53:11.092 --> 00:53:12.312
I'm good.

00:53:12.312 --> 00:53:13.770
So I overproportioned a little bit.

00:53:13.770 --> 00:53:14.460
And that's fine.

00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:15.460
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:17.360
Because no one's going to eat it.

00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:19.334
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:53:19.334 --> 00:53:21.750
Actually, can I have a little
bit of stock because I think

00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:24.050
that overreduced my
emulsion a little bit.

00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.300
It's actually to the point
where it starting to break.

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:31.070
But we'll bring it back together just by
adding a little bit more liquid to it.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:31.910
And there we go.

00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:39.870
And then because everything
tastes better with pepperoni,

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:41.441
at least in my mind.

00:53:44.619 --> 00:53:46.160
This isn't really called an emulsion.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.520
But it's just called damn good.

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:47.880
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I'm hungry.

00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:50.880
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So I'd say
take pepperoni and grind it.

00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.990
And take the fat from the pepperoni
and toast bread crumb in it

00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:55.470
and then put the two together.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:59.170
So I call it an emulsion because you're
taking two things that normally don't

00:53:59.170 --> 00:54:01.540
go together and you put them together.

00:54:01.540 --> 00:54:03.530
So then we put that over the top.

00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:06.670
And we have squid ink tonnarelli,
with blue crab, jalapeno,

00:54:06.670 --> 00:54:08.120
and pepperoni crumb.

00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:14.200
Oh, my arugula leaves.

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:16.720
I want that.

00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:18.190
And arugula, sorry.

00:54:20.787 --> 00:54:22.078
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And arugula.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.764
Well, this looks stingy.

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:33.665
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So this sauce would
only look maybe a little bit-- well,

00:54:33.665 --> 00:54:37.130
I don't know it would be interesting
or not because actually there's

00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:39.380
some of the starches in the pan too.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:40.271
What would that like?

00:54:40.271 --> 00:54:42.020
MICHAEL BRENNER: Oh,
should we look at it?

00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:43.830
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'm just curious.

00:54:43.830 --> 00:54:44.170
MICHAEL BRENNER: Well, I--

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:46.280
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I just want to
see all my sauces on a microscope

00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.890
because I just think that's cool.

00:54:47.890 --> 00:54:49.270
All right.

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:51.062
So I was just trying
to come up with like--

00:54:51.062 --> 00:54:53.686
MICHAEL BRENNER: Well, what
happens to starch when you heat it?

00:54:53.686 --> 00:54:54.590
Does anybody know?

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:56.640
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: We should
make a business out of this.

00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.610
MICHAEL BRENNER: Does anybody know
what happens when starch [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:01.530
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Well, it gelatinizes
when they come together with a liquid.

00:55:01.530 --> 00:55:04.150
MICHAEL BRENNER: But did you know how
much it expands by, what fraction?

00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.410
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:55:04.410 --> 00:55:05.040
That I don't know.

00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.498
MICHAEL BRENNER: Does anybody know?

00:55:06.498 --> 00:55:09.890
How much does the volume of a starch
granule go up when you heat it?

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:11.378
By a factor of--

00:55:11.378 --> 00:55:13.620
AUDIENCE: 30.

00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:15.245
MICHAEL BRENNER: I think it's 30.

00:55:15.245 --> 00:55:16.500
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It's 30.

00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.060
MICHAEL BRENNER: It's 30.

00:55:17.060 --> 00:55:17.960
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's 30.

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.459
Yeah.

00:55:18.459 --> 00:55:19.382
That's right.

00:55:19.382 --> 00:55:19.870
MICHAEL BRENNER: That's huge.

00:55:19.870 --> 00:55:22.040
That's a good way to get the
volume fraction to go up, right?

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:23.700
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: The volume
fraction goes up to 30.

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:24.460
MICHAEL BRENNER: The
volume fraction goes up.

00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.980
Yeah.

00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.380
That's why starch
works when you heat it.

00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:29.380
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:55:29.380 --> 00:55:30.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:32.300
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.340
Wow!

00:55:33.340 --> 00:55:34.623
Hey!

00:55:34.623 --> 00:55:35.122
Huh?

00:55:35.122 --> 00:55:36.930
Look at that.

00:55:36.930 --> 00:55:38.295
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.599
It's moving.

00:55:42.599 --> 00:55:43.640
Oh, she's just moving it.

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.820
Never mind.

00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:47.820
Oh.

00:55:47.820 --> 00:55:49.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:51.610 --> 00:55:53.484
So what did we do there?

00:55:53.484 --> 00:55:54.734
MICHAEL BRENNER: I don't know.

00:55:54.734 --> 00:55:55.720
But it worked.

00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:56.280
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Does any know--

00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:56.446
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:55:56.446 --> 00:55:56.780
It did.

00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.220
It worked.

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.636
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --how much
the volume fraction went up?

00:55:59.636 --> 00:56:00.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.940
30.

00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:06.216
That's why you're sitting
there and I'm standing here.

00:56:06.216 --> 00:56:08.090
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Anybody
like to try a pasta?

00:56:08.090 --> 00:56:10.873
I hate to give out food.

00:56:10.873 --> 00:56:11.970
All right, my man.

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:13.080
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: He
brought his own spoon.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:13.470
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.474
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: He
brought his own spoon.

00:56:15.474 --> 00:56:16.932
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:20.119 --> 00:56:21.910
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: He's
been to these before.

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:23.350
He had a spoon in his back pocket.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:25.161
He was ready.

00:56:25.161 --> 00:56:27.660
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: If you could--
you want to sear the beef?

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:28.140
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I've got that.

00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.015
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It's
not going to be a big deal.

00:56:29.015 --> 00:56:31.850
It's just Wagyu beef,
short rib, pastrami,

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:36.372
that was cooked at 56 degrees
Celsius for 48 hours in a bag.

00:56:36.372 --> 00:56:37.080
It's no big deal.

00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:42.890
It's just like a chunk that
would fit inside there.

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:43.565
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: You got it.

00:56:43.565 --> 00:56:45.180
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: A little bit of oil.

00:56:45.180 --> 00:56:47.679
I mean because we're here to
talk about foams and emulsions.

00:56:47.679 --> 00:56:50.970
So that delicious piece of meat
really is not important right now.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:57.560
My next foam is made
out of sauerkraut juice.

00:56:57.560 --> 00:57:01.700
And so this is-- you know when
you get like a jar of sauerkraut

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:05.475
and you eat all the sauerkraut and
then you're left with all that liquid?

00:57:05.475 --> 00:57:07.850
You can make a Martini out of
it, which is delicious too.

00:57:07.850 --> 00:57:10.300
It's a dirty sauerkraut Martini.

00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:11.929
You guys don't drink here at all?

00:57:11.929 --> 00:57:12.470
AUDIENCE: No.

00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:13.386
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: No.

00:57:13.386 --> 00:57:13.980
OK.

00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:17.260
Or you can make sauerkraut foam.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.950
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:20.250 --> 00:57:21.890
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Finished.

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:24.640
And so if you want to get most
of my work done over there,

00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:25.240
I'm just going to make this foam.

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:25.680
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I am.

00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.390
That's what I'm working on right now.

00:57:27.390 --> 00:57:29.490
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Just
don't burn my sauce.

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:31.810
But butter, like could you emulsify a
little bit of butter into that for me?

00:57:31.810 --> 00:57:32.550
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: You got it.

00:57:32.550 --> 00:57:33.540
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Perfect.

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.700
Make it look like the last one that
was on the screen that was all--

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.930
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I was going
to say I have actually proven

00:57:36.930 --> 00:57:38.490
I'm really good at it, by the way.

00:57:38.490 --> 00:57:39.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:39.314 --> 00:57:42.370
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Um-- said it again.

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.875
This is Gray Poupon.

00:57:46.875 --> 00:57:50.144
I found it in the student cafeteria.

00:57:50.144 --> 00:57:52.060
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I thought
there was a guy who

00:57:52.060 --> 00:57:54.559
was driving down with a big
fancy Bentley, who passed it out

00:57:54.559 --> 00:57:55.370
of the window.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:56.106
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:57.419 --> 00:57:59.710
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Stole it
from the student cafeteria.

00:58:02.710 --> 00:58:06.110
I'm just going to--
this part's technical.

00:58:06.110 --> 00:58:12.226
I'm going to say roughly about three
stolen packages of Gray Poupon.

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:24.230
Sauerkraut juice-- and for this foam,
because sauerkraut juice is basically

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:29.910
just water at this point,
I want to get it foamy,

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:35.160
and thick, and beautiful, and fix my
hair with it, and stuff like that.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:39.340
So what I did was I scaled
out some Versawhip, which

00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:44.370
is basically soy protein.

00:58:44.370 --> 00:58:50.961
It was created to eliminate the
use of egg whites and gelatin

00:58:50.961 --> 00:58:52.210
and be able to make meringues.

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:57.810
And so this is going to be a sauerkraut
meringue that's actually vegan,

00:58:57.810 --> 00:59:00.390
that I'm going to put
on top of red meat.

00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:01.836
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:01.836 --> 00:59:06.782
I fixed that problem real fast.

00:59:06.782 --> 00:59:09.945
[GRINDING]

00:59:09.945 --> 00:59:11.820
And so I added a little
bit of mustard to it,

00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:13.194
just to add a little more flavor.

00:59:13.194 --> 00:59:16.025
What I made here was what
Brian has in his hand.

00:59:16.025 --> 00:59:18.810
If you look at the marbling
in that, it's pretty good.

00:59:18.810 --> 00:59:20.140
But we're talking about this.

00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.098
So that doesn't matter.

00:59:21.098 --> 00:59:23.890
But that's a pastrami--
yeah, the marbling is just--

00:59:23.890 --> 00:59:24.950
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh, I'm
doing a bad job with that.

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:26.158
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: --so good.

00:59:26.158 --> 00:59:29.890
Maybe next time we do a class about me
and I'll make you guys some of that.

00:59:29.890 --> 00:59:33.700
So that's been cooked for
a couple days in a bag.

00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:36.140
You guys all do that at home now too.

00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.160
You know, it's funny.

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:40.480
The other night, a regular of
ours comes in the restaurant.

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:43.050
And he loves our short rib.

00:59:43.050 --> 00:59:45.520
And so I asked him, do you
want to take some home?

00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:46.770
And I gave it to him in a bag.

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:49.600
And I started say to him,
just put it on the stove

00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:52.431
and heat it up with a little
water, drop the bag into the pot.

00:59:52.431 --> 00:59:53.430
And the guy looks at me.

00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:54.304
He's just a customer.

00:59:54.304 --> 00:59:57.020
And he goes, can I just heat it
up in my immersion circulator?

00:59:57.020 --> 00:59:59.950
And I'm like sure you can.

01:00:04.644 --> 01:00:05.560
This is the Versawhip.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.010
[GRINDING]

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:26.860
Out of this, on that is going
to be like-- but not yet.

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:42.940
OK.

01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:45.040
So that's my sauerkraut juice.

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:46.625
Are you burning something over there?

01:00:46.625 --> 01:00:47.458
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:50.920
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It smells
like really delicious pastrami.

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.420
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'm not burning it.

01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.570
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And
so-- that's not ready yet.

01:00:55.570 --> 01:00:57.570
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:02.954
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: What did I miss?

01:01:02.954 --> 01:01:04.802
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It's not ready.

01:01:04.802 --> 01:01:08.060
I'm not done showing off.

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:08.690
All right.

01:01:08.690 --> 01:01:15.600
So now it's going to get whipped.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:26.790
And hopefully it's going to turn into
like a sauerkraut and mustard meringue

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:30.000
that I'm going to put onto my beef dish.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.420
And so-- yeah, can you just
baste it a little bit with-- just

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.976
like-- and then-- yeah, perfect.

01:01:36.976 --> 01:01:38.806
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Thank you, chef.

01:01:38.806 --> 01:01:41.236
[GRINDING]

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.498
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:56.520
[WHISTLING]

01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.930
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I
don't really-- yeah.

01:01:57.930 --> 01:02:00.429
I don't have anything to say
while this is-- all the work is

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:02.180
happening in the mixer right now.

01:02:02.180 --> 01:02:05.240
I guess I'll start plating.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:13.480
So these are cabbage pickles or
fermented cabbage, lacto-fermintation.

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.610
It's just some raw cabbage that
we cut out with a fancy cutter,

01:02:17.610 --> 01:02:21.559
put it into a bag, 2% salt. Let
it hang out in a dry storage

01:02:21.559 --> 01:02:22.850
room at work for a couple days.

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:25.099
Hope the health department
didn't come by and find it.

01:02:25.099 --> 01:02:28.820
And these are really delicious.

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.972
And so that will be
one if the garnishes.

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:39.862
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Ah,
I want to push that.

01:02:39.862 --> 01:02:41.028
I'm going to put meat there.

01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:15.962
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And so now I'm going
to take this really inexpensive meat--

01:03:15.962 --> 01:03:17.585
are you guys hungry?

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:18.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.960
[LAUGHTER]

01:03:26.165 --> 01:03:27.415
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: That's harsh.

01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:33.007
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: That's
disgusting-ly good.

01:03:33.007 --> 01:03:34.006
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

01:03:34.006 --> 01:03:35.470
I did good, right?

01:03:53.593 --> 01:03:57.240
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Man, see--
I just want to talk about that.

01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.160
I can't talk about it.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:58.659
I want to.

01:03:58.659 --> 01:03:59.540
But I can't.

01:03:59.540 --> 01:04:00.405
It's not that fresh.

01:04:04.211 --> 01:04:06.294
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Who's
that guy who refilmed that?

01:04:06.294 --> 01:04:07.315
Woo, man.

01:04:07.315 --> 01:04:08.564
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: How's that?

01:04:08.564 --> 01:04:10.576
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: That was me.

01:04:10.576 --> 01:04:12.508
Well, my mic's not working.

01:04:12.508 --> 01:04:13.508
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Yeah.

01:04:13.508 --> 01:04:16.400
We did that on purpose.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.650
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.820
A little bit of beef jus.

01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.650
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Now, I have to
see this under the microscope.

01:04:26.650 --> 01:04:30.802
I've actually never seen-- no, just
because I've never seen-- well,

01:04:30.802 --> 01:04:33.010
I've never seen any of this
stuff under a microscope.

01:04:33.010 --> 01:04:36.677
But I'm really curious what
does beef jus look like.

01:04:36.677 --> 01:04:39.010
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: How well
your brother can make sauce?

01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:40.870
Put that thing on the microscope.

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:43.460
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I added the
butter, just pointing that out.

01:04:44.864 --> 01:04:47.280
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Can you
guys see what's happening here?

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:47.510
Wait.

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.199
Can I move this without hurting myself?

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.147
It's just sauerkraut foam.

01:04:55.147 --> 01:04:55.980
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: No.

01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.250
They were just talking about the--

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.310
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: NBD,
that means no big deal.

01:04:59.310 --> 01:05:00.230
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Oh.

01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:03.131
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And
blowing your mind right now.

01:05:03.131 --> 01:05:04.592
[CHEER]

01:05:04.592 --> 01:05:05.570
[APPLAUSE]

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:06.630
Thank you.

01:05:06.630 --> 01:05:07.130
Yeah.

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.270
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: There you got on.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.550
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh, yeah.

01:05:10.550 --> 01:05:11.860
I made that.

01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.552
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: And the
arrow is not on it either.

01:05:15.552 --> 01:05:18.010
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Because
there's too much going up there.

01:05:19.274 --> 01:05:21.440
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I don't
know what I was looking at.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:24.620
But it looked good.

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.538
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: These are those
lacto-fermented petals of cabbage.

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.960
I've got some cabbage chips here.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.820
These are fun.

01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:41.790
Basically, those are tattoos.

01:05:41.790 --> 01:05:42.950
Those are disgusting.

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:44.450
Oh, hold on.

01:05:44.450 --> 01:05:48.450
Can you-- perfect.

01:05:48.450 --> 01:05:50.880
See that?

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.260
These you just fry.

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:56.246
Take raw cabbage, fry it like 300
degrees Fahrenheit in oil, dry it.

01:05:56.246 --> 01:05:58.370
And then stick it in the
dehydrator for a few hours

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:00.824
and you get these
delicious cabbage chips.

01:06:00.824 --> 01:06:02.490
You're not going to get eat any of this.

01:06:02.490 --> 01:06:05.233
So I shouldn't use
adjectives like delicious.

01:06:05.233 --> 01:06:06.816
It's probably just going to upset you.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:18.641
I mean it's class about foam, a lecture
about foam, lecture-- class, lecture.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:19.890
We're just talking about foam.

01:06:19.890 --> 01:06:21.854
It's a talk.

01:06:21.854 --> 01:06:22.770
Ted's not here though.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:23.745
Where's Ted?

01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:25.725
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:28.019
I think that's pretty foamy.

01:06:28.019 --> 01:06:29.810
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I
don't know where Ted is.

01:06:29.810 --> 01:06:32.887
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And so that's
sauerkraut juice and some Versawhip.

01:06:32.887 --> 01:06:34.318
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:39.160
That thing's going to go nuts.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:39.780
That's it?

01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:41.321
That's going to make the whole thing?

01:06:43.492 --> 01:06:44.950
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It's a microscope.

01:06:44.950 --> 01:06:47.990
It looks at small things
and makes it bigger.

01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:50.400
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:51.900
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Brrh.

01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.047
So we're going to just put a
little bit of that sauerkraut.

01:07:02.047 --> 01:07:03.630
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: He got oohs and awes.

01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:04.690
Hey, look at that.

01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.496
There it is.

01:07:08.496 --> 01:07:09.179
Look it.

01:07:09.179 --> 01:07:09.720
Check it out.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.460
You got big bubbles in there.

01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:18.310
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Meat likes pepper.

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.880
Nasturtiums tastes like pepper.

01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.940
Chefs put pretty flowers
on stuff because they just

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.140
put pretty flowers on stuff.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.180
This is intentional.

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:27.180
These nasturtiums actually
taste pretty peppery.

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:31.480
And so beef and pepper
go really well together.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.644
I mean you're not going to know because
I'm not going to let you eat this.

01:07:34.644 --> 01:07:35.810
Somebody is going to eat it.

01:07:35.810 --> 01:07:37.399
I mean you brought your own spoon.

01:07:37.399 --> 01:07:38.940
But you don't bring a knife and fork.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:41.330
So you're not getting this one.

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:43.180
[LAUGHTER]

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.710
Who has a fork?

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:47.690
I'm bringing it right to you.

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:50.190
[APPLAUSE]

01:07:51.055 --> 01:07:53.846
MICHAEL BRENNER: Maybe you should
go to somebody in the back corner

01:07:53.846 --> 01:07:55.717
because they haven't got anything.

01:07:55.717 --> 01:07:57.550
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I'll
take them some beef.

01:07:57.550 --> 01:07:58.335
She has a fork.

01:08:06.370 --> 01:08:14.715
And so that's Waygu, short rib,
pastrami, with sauerkraut foam.

01:08:14.715 --> 01:08:16.126
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:20.240
Michael, this is all back row.

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.052
Dibs, back row right here.

01:08:23.052 --> 01:08:24.760
MICHAEL BRENNER: This
is for the back row

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.551
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO:
That's for the back row.

01:08:26.551 --> 01:08:28.488
This is for the lady with the fork.

01:08:28.488 --> 01:08:31.279
[APPLAUSE]

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:33.590
Man, you have 300 people
hating you right now.

01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:34.649
How does that feel?

01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:35.479
There you go.

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:37.680
Turn around, bow.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.625
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:42.301 --> 01:08:44.300
It's like when you see
somebody win the lottery,

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:45.758
like you want to be happy for them.

01:08:45.758 --> 01:08:50.870
But it's just like, ah,
why didn't I bring a fork?

01:08:50.870 --> 01:08:52.370
We have five minutes, one more dish.

01:08:52.370 --> 01:08:54.994
We're going to do six dishes in
one hour, if we get these done.

01:08:54.994 --> 01:08:56.960
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I can
do this in five minutes

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.010
because I already prepped an area.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.410
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: We need like
a countdown or an official--

01:08:59.410 --> 01:09:01.241
I feel like you should
feel the pressure.

01:09:01.241 --> 01:09:03.074
You have five minutes
to get this dish done.

01:09:03.074 --> 01:09:04.199
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: All right.

01:09:04.199 --> 01:09:05.059
So this dish--

01:09:05.059 --> 01:09:05.850
AUDIENCE: Top Chef.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.017
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Top Chef.

01:09:07.017 --> 01:09:08.933
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I'm
very prepared everything.

01:09:08.933 --> 01:09:10.771
So this dish-- well, you said that.

01:09:10.771 --> 01:09:12.479
Now, I got to tell a
story about this one

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.590
because there's always a story to it.

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:18.189
So during a holiday season,
you're shopping in a mall.

01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:21.410
And you walk by and you smell, like,
this strong slap in the face of,

01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:25.720
like, vanilla, and cinnamon, and,
like, cider, around the holiday season,

01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:27.080
around this time of the year.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.420
It's normally a Bath and Body Works or
something like that because it's so.

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:33.700
So this dish is literally
inspired by me going shopping

01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:35.560
for my wife for Christmas.

01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.430
And so what it is is coconut,
lavender, and vanilla.

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:43.800
So three flavors you wouldn't normally
expect to go together on a plate.

01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:44.922
But they work really well.

01:09:44.922 --> 01:09:46.880
And one of the cool things
about it is I wanted

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.100
to make this dish because
it was the holiday season

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:50.725
and I wanted to make it look like snow.

01:09:50.725 --> 01:09:54.490
So I wanted to make it look
like a snowball, and snow,

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:55.850
and like all of those things.

01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:59.300
And it's dish that we've been running
at the restaurant for a long time.

01:09:59.300 --> 01:10:02.810
But I had no idea that we used foams,
and emulsions, and all of those things

01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:08.840
when we made the dish until we filled
in for somebody else in this lecture

01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:10.612
and we had to send some recipes up.

01:10:10.612 --> 01:10:13.820
And I started to realize that actually
there was a little bit of science that

01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:15.270
went behind creating this dish.

01:10:15.270 --> 01:10:17.820
So much like Michael,
in the dish that he

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.910
did earlier, the first
one, the cucumber,

01:10:19.910 --> 01:10:27.740
I made a foam using coconut, some milk,
some yogurt, and, oh, some xanthan gum.

01:10:27.740 --> 01:10:32.776
And so that was used to suspend it
and then charged it again with NO2

01:10:32.776 --> 01:10:35.369
to make a foam texture.

01:10:35.369 --> 01:10:36.660
You don't have to work anymore.

01:10:40.050 --> 01:10:42.230
So I'm going to charge it
with two of these chargers

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:45.626
and then let that sit for a minute.

01:10:45.626 --> 01:10:48.488
I already put one in.

01:10:48.488 --> 01:10:49.765
You have to tap that bottom.

01:10:49.765 --> 01:10:51.464
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: That's OK.

01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:53.336
Tell them.

01:10:53.336 --> 01:10:54.135
[LAUGHTER]

01:10:54.135 --> 01:10:55.260
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: All right.

01:10:55.260 --> 01:11:00.130
So the first component, what
this is, this is not an emulsion.

01:11:00.130 --> 01:11:08.940
But what this is we used a starch
and took oil made with lavender

01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:09.856
and turned it into a--

01:11:09.856 --> 01:11:11.439
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: What are you doing?

01:11:11.439 --> 01:11:12.670
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:12.670 --> 01:11:15.550
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: She
just stole the beef.

01:11:15.550 --> 01:11:16.800
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:17.640
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: She's
allowed to have it.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.098
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: This is Harvard.

01:11:21.147 --> 01:11:22.438
They don't feed you at Harvard?

01:11:24.953 --> 01:11:28.036
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So this is actually
oil that's been turned into a powder.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:35.660
And so that's the lavender
component to the dish.

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:39.250
Then what we're to do is we're going to
takes some of this liquid nitrogen. Oh,

01:11:39.250 --> 01:11:41.150
we're not going to pour it on our hand.

01:11:41.150 --> 01:11:43.114
Pour it into the bowl.

01:11:43.114 --> 01:11:44.060
Where's that ladle at?

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:53.670
So I let the ladle get really cold.

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:57.320
So the lavender, coconut, and
vanilla, what this is, these

01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:03.340
are little meringues that have been made
with vanilla, vanilla syrup, and sugar.

01:12:03.340 --> 01:12:08.360
I made this one easy, this one we're
just kind of talking about here.

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.450
Let's place that on.

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:10.650
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It
tastes like Lucky Charms.

01:12:10.650 --> 01:12:12.180
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Coconut pudding,
it does taste like Lucky Charms.

01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:13.830
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I love Lucky Charms.

01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:14.380
Oh, wait.

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:17.080
That was on camera.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:19.189
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So this
is a coconut pudding,

01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:20.480
which is made with xanthan gum.

01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.950
So we make a gel with
coconut milk and steep

01:12:23.950 --> 01:12:29.230
it some lemon grass and some lime leaf.

01:12:29.230 --> 01:12:32.540
And then make a pudding with
that and then puree it smooth.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:34.340
So it's a set pudding first.

01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:40.560
And we set to the point where it's
almost like the texture of hard candy--

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.780
not hard candy, but kind of like
[INAUDIBLE], almost like a soft candy.

01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:46.450
And then we puree it smooth.

01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:48.190
And it gets a really great texture.

01:12:48.190 --> 01:12:51.412
Then lastly, I'm going to
take nitrogen and a ladle.

01:12:51.412 --> 01:12:53.578
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: You
should put your tongue on it.

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:04.760
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: And we're
going to make a ball of foam.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:14.052
Now, we're going to place
it into liquid nitrogen.

01:13:14.052 --> 01:13:16.760
I know around here you're supposed
to wear gloves and eyeglasses.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.090
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO:
Goggles, eye protection.

01:13:18.090 --> 01:13:19.089
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I know.

01:13:19.089 --> 01:13:19.820
But it's OK.

01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:21.296
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Easy.

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:21.980
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: You can touch it.

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:24.771
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Just like that,
he like puts it behind his ears.

01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:31.120
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: And then what we
have here is a shell on the outside.

01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:33.360
So everybody likes a
magic shell and ice cream.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:33.860
No.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.150
It's gross, actually.

01:13:35.150 --> 01:13:36.960
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: I think it's gross.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:37.560
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: I don't know.

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:39.370
There's all kinds of weird
things in that stuff.

01:13:39.370 --> 01:13:40.440
But basically that's what we're doing.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:41.939
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Like xanthan gum?

01:13:41.939 --> 01:13:47.900
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: We have this
really great dome that's frozen.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:49.742
The foam is suspended and frozen.

01:13:49.742 --> 01:13:51.200
But then the foam is in the center.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:53.404
So when you crack it, it
opens up and oozes out.

01:13:53.404 --> 01:13:54.570
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Prove it.

01:13:54.570 --> 01:13:56.404
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: So
then goes onto the dish.

01:13:56.404 --> 01:13:58.819
Well, somebody else is going
to come up here and prove it.

01:13:58.819 --> 01:13:59.660
AUDIENCE: Throw it.

01:13:59.660 --> 01:14:00.743
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: Throw it?

01:14:00.743 --> 01:14:02.464
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:02.464 --> 01:14:03.250
I don't know.

01:14:03.250 --> 01:14:03.955
Is that allowed?

01:14:06.690 --> 01:14:08.225
OK, go ahead.

01:14:08.225 --> 01:14:08.726
[TAPPING]

01:14:08.726 --> 01:14:09.808
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: Oh, oh.

01:14:09.808 --> 01:14:10.600
Just kidding.

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.450
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: It will crack.

01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:13.830
So it cracks open.

01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:16.250
And then you have this really
great aerated foam texture

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:17.410
in the center and sort of like--

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:17.475
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: It died.

01:14:17.475 --> 01:14:19.808
BRYAN VOLTAGGIO: --this frozen
ice cream on the outside.

01:14:19.808 --> 01:14:22.361
So that's coconut,
lavender, and vanilla.

01:14:22.361 --> 01:14:23.255
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:23.755
Thank you.

01:14:23.755 --> 01:14:25.546
MICHAEL VOLTAGGIO: And
that was number six.

01:14:25.546 --> 01:14:26.320
So we did it.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.770
We did it in--

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:30.650
[APPLAUSE]

01:14:31.610 --> 01:14:32.540
Thank you, guys.

01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:34.560
Thank you very much.
