00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:01.330
YVONNE: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.996
We're going to go
ahead and get started.

00:00:02.996 --> 00:00:03.840
Are we OK?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.340
Yeah.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.981
OK.

00:00:04.981 --> 00:00:05.480
Hi.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.250
I'm Yvonne [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.720
I'm the VP of Benefits.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.820
And I said over,
normally, at 123.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.550
And it's my pleasure, today,
to welcome Dr. Jeff Sutherland

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.690
who's going to talk to us
about his new book "Scrum".

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.580
How many people have
heard of scrum the term?

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.310
Oh, wow.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.770
OK, [LAUGHS]

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.332
So I'm completely outnumbered.

00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:27.790
And you probably
all know that it's

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:30.100
a term that comes out of
rugby, which I did not

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.354
know before reading the book.

00:00:32.354 --> 00:00:34.270
But he's going to talk
to us about Scrum which

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.670
is an approach to work
and project development

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.439
that he's used in
different areas.

00:00:39.439 --> 00:00:41.480
I'm not going to go too
much into his background.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.560
Because he's going to go into
that as he tells his story.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.790
One thing I will say is
that, in reading the book,

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.910
it really resonated
with me about how

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.720
we work at Google-- the idea
of working in small teams,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.480
providing a lot of autonomy,
having managers get out

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.020
of the way, and really
facilitate the work

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.280
that their teams are doing.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.220
So without further ado, join
me in welcoming Dr. Jeff

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.840
Sutherland.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.289
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.382 --> 00:01:09.090
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND:
Thank you very much.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.470
I've been doing a book tour
for the last couple weeks.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.967
And last week, I
spent a lot of time

00:01:13.967 --> 00:01:16.550
in Silicon Valley meeting with
all the larger companies there.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.140
But I didn't hit
Google this time.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.090
So I'm doing Google
here in London.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.420
The talk, about the book,
started with a Ted Talk.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.740
And they had this
video front-ending

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.370
my Ted Talk, which
I really liked.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.540
Because it was kind of the
French view of what "Scrum" is.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.660
So they had these big
concrete blocks, then,

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:41.870
shattering on the pavement.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.860
And then, they said Scrum is
about hacking leadership, which

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.440
Google has done a great job of.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.480
But most companies
have a problem with it.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.050
The Ted Talk was in France.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.730
So I decided I'd
start by talking

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.400
about the Declaration
of Independence.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.110
Because the French had helped
us win the American Revolution.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.310
They sent General
Lafayette over to fight

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:06.330
with George Washington.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.619
And then, some years later, they
give us the Statue of Liberty.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.660
So I went back to the
Declaration of Independence

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.660
and said, every citizen
in the United States,

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.450
and maybe even in
Britain as well,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.779
is entitled to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:02:22.779 --> 00:02:24.070
But how are we doing with that?

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.170
If you look at the
average person,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.140
you're living in a happy
bubble here at Google.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.000
But the rest of those
people out there, [LAUGHS]

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.590
they're miserable, OK?

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.310
People hate work.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.390
The only thing worse than going
to work is being sick in bed.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.140
And "New York
Times" has even done

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.810
an analysis of why
people hate work.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.770
Because they're working hard.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.060
They never have
enough time, never

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.355
get to work on what they want.

00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:52.230
They're working late.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.210
They're working weekends.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.918
They don't have time
with their families.

00:02:54.918 --> 00:02:55.830
They have no life.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.950
They have no freedom.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.690
And as a result,
they're very unhappy.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.750
So the root of all this
is, for most people,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.210
they're under the gun to
deliver something-- a product,

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.700
a project.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.000
But as Robert Burns says,
the best laid plans,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.810
of mice and men, often go wrong.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.390
And you wind up with a
lot of pain and suffering

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.750
instead of the promised joy.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.910
And I learned about this kind of
thing as a cadet at West Point.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.680
Here I am at Beast Barracks.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.140
I'm being yelled at
by a first classman.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.760
After running around all day,
being yelled at, at night

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.010
we had what they call
the shower formation.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.400
And what he's doing is
telling me to get my chin in

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.520
hard enough to drench
my bathrobe with sweat.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.370
Because only when
you would drench did

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.120
you get to go into the shower.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.410
So I had to learn how
to generate twice as

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.170
much sweat in half the time, OK?

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:59.370
Standing next to me is Four-Star
General Barry McCaffrey.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.020
So I learned how to deal with
really difficult situations

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.110
as a West Point cadet.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.390
My last year there,
I was, actually,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.530
got the job as training
officer for my company.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.650
It was Company L2.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.094
There were 24 companies
in the Corp of Cadets.

00:04:16.094 --> 00:04:17.760
And one of the primary
responsibilities,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.329
of a training officer, was to
get the cadets to march really

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.180
well in the Formal Parades.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.860
We had at least
three of them a week.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.720
And they always had a
lot of tourists there.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.640
The brass was all there.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.930
And the problem was my
company was Company L2.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.110
And they had been
known, for 100 years,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.130
as the "Loose Deuce" because
of their sloppy performance

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.400
on the parade field.

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.790
And no matter how
much overtime we

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:47.390
spent marching, trying to
get them to march better,

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.840
the culture of mediocrity
was just pervasive.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.200
So I decided I would try
something very different.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.660
And instead of talking
to them, instead of

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.240
trying to coach them, I just
started putting up on the wall,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.200
in colored notes, after
the parade all the scores.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.720
We lost 10 points
because Charlie

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.370
had his sword stuck in the dirt
in the middle of the parade

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.290
field.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.292
We lost five points because
the platoon, turning

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:15.000
onto to the parade
field was not aligned.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.800
We lost eight points because
the company commander did not

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.740
articulate the command
at the right time.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.880
To everyone's amazement,
within three months,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.240
Company L2 became the
number one marching company,

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.520
in the Corps of Cadets, for
the first time in 202 years.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.580
It's unbelievable.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.260
And it was all because of
making the work visible,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.910
they self-organized
to do a great job.

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:43.400
And about that time, one of
our most famous graduates

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.320
died, General Douglas MacArthur.

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.984
He was very close to
the Corp of Cadets

00:05:48.984 --> 00:05:50.400
during the last
years of his life.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.700
His last speech is memorized,
to this day, by every cadet.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.940
And he had specified,
when he died,

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.670
that after laying in
state, in Washington DC,

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.220
he was to be pulled
by a riderless horse.

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.530
His casket would be pulled by
a riderless horse to his grave.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.010
And marching behind that casket
would be a company of cadets.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:19.230
And so Company L2, being the
number one marching company

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.530
in the Corp, was selected
to bury General MacArthur.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:29.800
The last parade of the
year, the Graduation Parade,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.170
my future father-in-law
was there.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.970
And after the parade,
he said, "Jeff,

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.470
who was that last company
in the Corp of Cadets?

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.930
They seemed to float
across the field.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.535
They were different than every
other company in the Corp."

00:06:43.535 --> 00:06:44.910
I said, "Well,
those are the guys

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:46.290
that buried General MacArthur.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.440
And they will never forget it."

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.410
So that taught me one of the
first principles in Scrum.

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.630
If you make the
work visible, teams

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:59.760
will self-organize
to do great things.

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.460
Another thing I
learned at West Point,

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.730
from another famous
graduate, General Eisenhower.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.290
I slept in his room
when I was a cadet.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.380
He had a gold plaque,
on the mantlepiece,

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.110
saying General Dwight D.
Eisenhower slept here.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:15.660
And sometimes, the
light reflecting off it

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.640
would wake me at night.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.780
And I would think, what
was General Eisenhower

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.620
thinking when he was a cadet?

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.120
Well, he had a famous quote
called, "Plans are worthless.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.590
But planning is everything."

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.800
When he planned D-day, to
takes the beach at Normandy,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.040
he did a lot of planning.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.040
But he knew as soon as
the first shot was fired,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:36.070
that plan would be shattered.

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.900
And the teams would
have to self-organize

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.100
to take the beach.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.310
I learned about that,
firsthand, as a fighter pilot.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.180
When I graduated, I
went into the Air Force.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:50.450
Here's a photo of one of my
fellow pilots getting blown out

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.210
of the sky, over Hanoi,
by a SAM missile.

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:58.110
And what I learned is that
if you follow the flight

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:03.490
plan, that you made over the
most heavily defended airspace

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.210
in the history of
aerial warfare,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.660
you will get shot down.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.200
And, in fact, about half
of us got shot down.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.826
Most did not come back.

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.010
Ed Atterberry was,
actually, captured.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.320
He wound up in Hanoi Hilton.

00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.380
He was a tough character.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.230
He escaped.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.640
But they recaptured him and
then, tortured him to death.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:27.490
So that was a typical fate
for half of my fellow pilots.

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:29.790
So I learned, when
crossing the border,

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:33.330
that you needed to go
into an evasive maneuver.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.070
And never stop evading.

00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.919
Only at the last moment, in
a very unpredictable way,

00:08:38.919 --> 00:08:42.200
would you pop over
the target and then,

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.980
back in the evasive maneuver.

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:48.460
So I credit my survival
to not following

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.740
the plan and a lot of luck.

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:55.030
Now, when you come back from
an experience like that,

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.720
you have a lot of
emotional reactions.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.200
The first one is
you feel guilty.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.500
Like, half of my
buddies are dead.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:04.840
And I'm alive.

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.014
It's not fair to them.

00:09:07.014 --> 00:09:09.180
And then, the next feeling
you have is exhilaration.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:09.960
Like, thank God.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.566
I survived.

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:14.190
And then, the third
feeling you have is

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.710
like, well, what am I going
to do for the rest of my life?

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.600
I've kind of got a bonus life.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.440
I should have been dead but
now, every day is a bonus day.

00:09:25.834 --> 00:09:27.250
So I thought about
it for a while.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.760
And I asked the Air
Force to send me

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:35.090
back to Stanford University
to get an advanced degree

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.870
to go teach at the Air Force
Academy in the Mathematics

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:41.560
Department.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.670
They agreed to do that.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:44.950
And that gave me a
lot of time to think

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.790
about life, the
universe, and everything.

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.300
I studied math, probabilities,
statistics, computer science.

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.460
I spent a lot of
time in the AI lab.

00:09:52.460 --> 00:09:54.270
You techie guys
might appreciate it.

00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:56.560
Any of you Lisp
programmers in here?

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.340
Don't do any Lisp anymore?

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:03.510
One of the two godfathers
of AI was running the AI lab

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:06.850
at Stanford, Professor McCarthy.

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:07.800
And he would come by.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.984
I was there, just as a
student, doing a project.

00:10:10.984 --> 00:10:13.150
And he would come by every
day complaining bitterly.

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.090
Because I was using 10% of the
compute power in the AI lab,

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.880
for my checker program.

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.500
I was writing a program that
would play checkers, and beat

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.820
people, and play
against computers,

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:26.440
and that sort of thing.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.690
So I got christened,
very early on,

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:32.230
by some of the leaders in
artificial intelligence

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.350
at Stanford.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.060
I was also as strongly
affected by a mentor,

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:41.230
Professor Katchadourian
on the left there.

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:43.870
At the time, he was the chair
of the Department of Psychiatry.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:48.400
He had been a student of
my father-in-law, a very

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.264
distinguished physician,
who we viewed as a god.

00:10:52.264 --> 00:10:54.180
I could never say anything
negative about him,

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.020
or I would be
reprimanded immediately.

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.020
But he took me under his wing
and gave me some guidance.

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.620
And my favorite courses
actually, at Stanford,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.020
were in the medical school.

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.890
Because the surgeons reminded
me a lot of fighter pilots.

00:11:10.890 --> 00:11:13.290
They had the kind
of same mentality.

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.850
And the courses I
was taking, they

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.940
were mainly focused
on biostatistics,

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.540
and clinical trials,
and things like that.

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:25.900
But he advised me not to go
into medicine as a clinician

00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:30.480
but to build on my
experience, brick by brick,

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.390
build on what I already knew.

00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:35.390
As a result, when I got
to the Air Force Academy

00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:39.880
and started teaching, I decided
to continue my advanced degree

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.550
work at the University of
Colorado medical school.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.210
So I would go
nights and weekends.

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:48.930
I would work on my degree
while I was teaching math

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.250
at the Air Force Academy.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.500
And one of the guys, that was
most important to me there,

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.420
was a guy named Dr. John Baylor.

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:59.710
Now, he was editor of the
"Journal of the National Cancer

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.570
Institute".

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:03.040
And he had just
written a paper showing

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.850
that there were more women
that got cancer and died

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:09.700
of radiation dosage,
from mammography,

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.600
than were saved by
early detection.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.790
And the American College
of Radiology was furious.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.040
So they wanted to tar and
feather him, and run him out

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.680
of the United States.

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.920
What happened is that the
National Cancer Institute

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.150
convened a blue-ribbon panel
that met for six months.

00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:27.900
At the end of those
six months, they

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.420
determined that Dr.
Baylor was exactly right,

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.500
and all the
standards, protocols,

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:36.810
and treatment for
mammography were changed.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.030
And to this day, I noticed,
even in the last year,

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:44.080
they're fine-tuning that based
on Baylor's recommendations.

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.330
So I had a lot of
respect for him

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:49.410
as a person who would stand
up for the right thing,

00:12:49.410 --> 00:12:52.310
and deal with any flack
that came his way,

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:54.590
and do something that's
useful to society.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:57.244
So I said to him, when he
visited the medical center,

00:12:57.244 --> 00:12:58.910
I said, "Dr. Baylor,"
I said, "You know,

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:00.770
I'd like to write a PhD thesis."

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:02.970
Do we have any PhDs in here?

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.780
Google hires PhDs, right?

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.040
And a lot of PhD
thesis, they just

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.860
wind up on the library
shelf, gathering dust.

00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:14.370
And I said, "I don't
want to do that.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:17.330
I want to write something
that is useful to people.

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:19.970
Can you help me with that?"

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.420
So Dr. Baylor
said, "Well, I have

00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.730
a couple of problems that
have been puzzling me

00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:25.770
for some years."

00:13:25.770 --> 00:13:27.960
So he gave me 300
clinical papers.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.130
He said, "Here's 300 papers
out of the medical journals.

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:34.540
And in every paper,
you will see graphs.

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:37.690
And the graphs are
dose response curves.

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.880
We put some carcinogen
on the back of a rat.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.940
And it grew a number of tumors."

00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:46.970
And there were papers on
rats, mice, monkeys, rabbits.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:50.450
Also papers on different
types of human cancers,

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:53.720
different types of cancers in
different parts of the world.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.620
He said, "Every paper has
a graph that's different.

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:57.600
Explain it.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:01.639
And then, we'll give you a PhD."

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:03.180
He said, "The only
problem," he says,

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:09.430
"You're going to have to model
how a cell becomes malignant.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:10.950
And nobody knows how that works.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:15.160
So you're going to have to
figure out what causes cancer.

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:19.630
And then, mathematically
model it on the computer.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:22.520
And then, map it to all the
data at the National Cancer

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:23.030
Institute.

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:27.695
We have huge amounts
of data, population-

00:14:27.695 --> 00:14:31.480
based data in many parts of the
United States for many years.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.530
And we also have data on
different types of tumors,

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:37.250
and so forth, for different
types of populations.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:40.190
So when your model
starts with a cell,

00:14:40.190 --> 00:14:42.190
and it maps how it
grows into a tumor,

00:14:42.190 --> 00:14:45.210
and then how a person winds
up in a doctor's office,

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.780
and then how they get treated.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.997
and then, that maps
into all the data."

00:14:48.997 --> 00:14:51.330
See that's the kind of stuff
you're doing here at Google

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.360
right now, right?

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.180
"Then you'll be done,"
he said. "But don't

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:01.240
worry because the leading cancer
researchers, in the world,

00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.950
are all submitting papers to me.

00:15:02.950 --> 00:15:06.730
And I will get them to
review anything that you do.

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:12.130
And we will guide you
step-by-step down the path."

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:16.670
So at the time, we
didn't understand.

00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:17.570
We understand today.

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:21.670
Today, with the DNA sequencing,
we know exactly what happens.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:26.380
A cell starts, that
bottom red cell, mutates,

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:27.740
turns into an orange cell.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.670
And then, that orange cell may
go in a couple of directions

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:32.110
through mutations.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:34.900
And if it goes off to the
left, if it goes to the right,

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:36.790
it goes to leukemia.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.740
If it goes up to the
yellow, it starts

00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:42.540
to turn into early
non-malignant tumors.

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.720
If it keeps on mutating,
goes up into the green,

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.140
then gets to the
blue, now you're

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.980
starting to get the first
malignant cell, which

00:15:48.980 --> 00:15:51.990
uncontrollable growth.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:54.170
Then, you treat it with
radiation and chemotherapy.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:55.220
And it mutates again.

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.410
And you've got a drug
resistant metastatic tumor.

00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:04.370
We didn't know any of that back
when I was doing my thesis.

00:16:04.370 --> 00:16:07.290
So I went to work
trying to model a cell,

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:09.130
and made some
assumptions about what

00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:13.190
needed to happen to
change that cell.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:17.010
It took me about a year to
complete the first program

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.490
that I could run
on the computer.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:27.080
And my first run used a third of
the Computer Science Department

00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.210
budget, for the year,
in the medical school.

00:16:30.210 --> 00:16:32.460
They told me I could never
run that program again.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:33.384
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.160
But what it did show is
that there are exactly

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:40.800
four steps to the
malignancy, which now we

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.820
know from DNA research.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.710
So the work we did became the
fundamental model for cancer

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.180
today.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:51.870
So it has been very valuable.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:55.190
But the question was, I needed
1,000 runs of this program

00:16:55.190 --> 00:16:56.600
to get my degree.

00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.440
And what was I
going to run it on?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.780
Well, the kind of computing
that we did, you can see,

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.770
this is actually a simpler
problem later down at NASA.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:10.069
It's evolutionary computing.

00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:12.640
Everything I did was based
on evolutionary biology.

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:13.540
And so is Scrum.

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.430
Scrum is based on
evolutionary biology.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:19.990
This particular example
is for how do you

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:26.089
build the best possible antenna
transmitter for a satellite?

00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:29.630
Well, instead of having
hardware designers,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.170
let's build evolutionary
algorithms on a computer.

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.960
And then, we can run
hundreds of thousands

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:39.320
of millions of simulations.

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:44.300
And we can wind up selecting
the best antenna design.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.420
Today, we can probably put it
into a 3D printer and print it.

00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.730
So the best thing is created
untouched by human hands.

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:54.610
It's just software, OK?

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:58.560
This particular
one, you can see,

00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.750
it was actually deployed
on Space Technology mission

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.180
5 in 2006.

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:04.920
It was launched.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:06.730
And it worked perfectly.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:12.610
So in order to
run this, this was

00:18:12.610 --> 00:18:15.040
done at the Ames Laboratory
in Silicon Valley.

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.070
They needed a highly parallel
system, 36 processors.

00:18:21.070 --> 00:18:24.800
And so my problem was where
was I going to get a system?

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:28.890
This was 25 years
earlier than NASA, OK?

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:32.660
Well, I went to work with the
head of the computing lab.

00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.740
And about that time,
Tandem had come out

00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:38.260
with its first
multiprocessor systems--

00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:41.180
fault-tolerant, nonstop.

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:44.000
And we decided to
buy two of them,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.025
two multiprocessor systems,
one for the hospital

00:18:46.025 --> 00:18:48.770
and one for the
medical computing lab.

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:51.250
And I was able, it had
a unique architecture

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:55.440
that enabled me to capture every
spare cycle on every processor

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:59.750
without interfering with the
normal work on the computer.

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:01.530
So for five years,
every processor

00:19:01.530 --> 00:19:04.750
on these Tandem
systems was pegged.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.552
And I could get a run to
complete at about a week.

00:19:07.552 --> 00:19:09.510
It would take about a
week to run a completion.

00:19:09.510 --> 00:19:11.430
But because the Tandem
was fault-tolerant,

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:13.220
nonstop, it always
ran the completion.

00:19:16.707 --> 00:19:18.290
I became a professor
in the University

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:19.664
when I got my
degree, a professor

00:19:19.664 --> 00:19:24.040
of radiology biometrics
and preventive medicine.

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.680
And I had millions of dollars,
every year, grant funding

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.900
from NCI to do cancer research.

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.160
Mostly mathematical
epidemiology is my area.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.150
And because of the Tandem
work we were doing,

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.901
a large banking company
came by one day.

00:19:39.901 --> 00:19:41.400
And they said, "Hey,
you know, Jeff,

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.600
you've got the best team outside
of Silicon Valley for Tandem

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:45.600
programming.

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.480
And over at the bank, we're
using these Tandems to roll out

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.625
automated teller systems."

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:54.380
They said, "We're running 150
banks all over North America.

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:56.370
And ATMs are exploding.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.010
We're having a lot of
trouble with this technology.

00:19:59.010 --> 00:20:03.070
But over the medical school,
you guys have all of knowledge.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.150
But over at the bank,
we have all the money.

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:05.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.090
"What if we put the knowledge
together with the money?"

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.775
And they made me an offer
that my wife couldn't refuse.

00:20:11.775 --> 00:20:13.882
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:13.882 --> 00:20:17.430
She's sitting back
there. [LAUGHS]

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:20.510
I wind up as Vice President for
Advanced Systems in the bank,

00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:22.390
OK?

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.550
Now, we had all kinds of
programmers in the bank.

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:26.490
But the largest
group of programmers

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:28.380
was COBOL programmers.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:30.904
Anybody programmed
in COBOL here?

00:20:30.904 --> 00:20:33.070
They probably don't hire
any COBOL programmers here.

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.359
Ah, we have a COBOL
programmer back there.

00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:37.900
And I looked at what
they were doing.

00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:40.850
Their projects were always late.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.480
And the management
were always upset.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.930
The customers were
always screaming.

00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:51.950
And they reminded me of
Romans rowing these galleons.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.550
Harder, harder, faster,
faster, guy cracking a whip.

00:20:56.550 --> 00:20:58.240
And I looked at what
they were doing.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.100
And I was just a guy
from a medical school.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:03.660
I had worked with Bell Labs.

00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.300
The guys that I was working
with were Kernighan and Ritchie,

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.240
who invented C Language.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.840
And they were giving
me their tools.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.410
And we were emulating how
they did it at Bell Labs

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.260
with small teams.

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:18.450
That's really where Scrum comes,
the idea for Scrum comes from.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.240
But I saw these huge
projects, always late.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.770
And they were run with
these Gantt charts.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:27.035
They were much
bigger than this one.

00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:30.460
The bank had one that would fill
the whole wall of this room.

00:21:30.460 --> 00:21:32.210
Thousands of tasks.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:35.740
Every task had a date
and a name on it.

00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.680
And I looked at that.

00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.970
And as a mathematician, I
said if one of those dates

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:44.962
is missed, they're
all going to slide.

00:21:44.962 --> 00:21:46.420
And the project's
going to be late.

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:47.711
What's the probability of that?

00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:52.890
It's 99.99999999.

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:55.820
Projects are
guaranteed to be late

00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.230
if you manage them
with Gantt charts.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.840
So I went into the CEO's office.

00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.310
And I said, "These
guys are crazy.

00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:06.142
They set up projects that
are guaranteed to be late.

00:22:06.142 --> 00:22:07.850
And now, the managers
are running around.

00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:10.183
And they think if they have
more meetings, more reports,

00:22:10.183 --> 00:22:12.590
and more micromanagement,
they can actually

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:14.350
bring them on time."

00:22:14.350 --> 00:22:16.620
I said, "It's never
going to work."

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:19.520
I said, "I want you to
give me the worst business

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.200
unit in the bank, which is the
one running these ATM systems."

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.800
It was bleeding
the most red ink.

00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.030
And I said, "I'm going
to run that as one team

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:30.280
with a bunch of small sub teams.

00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.070
And I want to run it as a
little company within a company.

00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:36.180
And every month, we'll present
our financial statements

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.570
to you and the
senior management.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:39.580
You can be our
board of directors.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:42.719
And the rest of the time,
you stay out of my company.

00:22:42.719 --> 00:22:44.010
I don't want you messing it up.

00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:47.120
And then, I will fix this."

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.610
So he thought about
it for a while.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.776
And he said, "Sutherland,
if you want this headache,

00:22:50.776 --> 00:22:51.290
you got it."

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:54.240
So I said, "I want everybody--
sales, marketing, support,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.270
engineering, everyone."

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.135
And we broke them
into small teams.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:04.430
In the Scrum guide,
we say three to nine.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.140
But it turns out,
Harvard research

00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:08.130
shows clearly that
the right sized

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.850
team, or the optimal
size, is 4.6 people.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:12.431
So--

00:23:12.431 --> 00:23:12.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.150
It's somewhere
between four and five.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.700
We ran them in short
cycles, weekly sprints.

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.310
At the beginning of the week,
we built a product backlog

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.150
that was prioritized
by business value,

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:27.720
particularly for the
engineers that were coding.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:29.920
We had a financial expert
come in, from the bank,

00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:33.990
and estimate the dollar
value of every feature.

00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:36.080
That, combined with
the work estimate,

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.240
allowed us to prioritize.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:41.790
At the end of the week, they
deployed those features.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:46.110
And in less than six months,
it became the most profitable

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:48.350
business unit in the bank.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:51.110
OK, so this was the
first prototype of Scrum.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:55.810
Now, in order to get
rid of the Gantt chart

00:23:55.810 --> 00:24:02.800
and manage the product
development successfully,

00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.260
this sliding off the
end of the Gantt chart

00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:07.900
reminded me of
training new pilots

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:10.800
on how to land a
high-performance job.

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:12.540
They were always coming in high.

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.650
And if you came in high
in one of these jets,

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:16.670
you could wind up
halfway down the runway

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:17.770
before you touched down.

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:19.554
If you did that, you
could slide right off

00:24:19.554 --> 00:24:20.470
the end of the runway.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.750
It happened to me twice.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.890
Fortunately, the
plane I flew was

00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:26.970
designed to land on
an aircraft carrier.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:28.845
And it had a tailhook.

00:24:28.845 --> 00:24:30.720
And they had chains at
the end of the runway.

00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.900
So both times I caught
the hook instead

00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:36.010
of sliding into the
buildings or the trees,

00:24:36.010 --> 00:24:39.470
and creating a big,
smoking hole, OK,

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:41.690
which is what would happen.

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:48.420
So I thought about here's the
plane I flew, an RF-4C Phantom.

00:24:48.420 --> 00:24:50.290
You notice, coming
down final approach,

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:54.050
he's making small, incremental
changes every step of the way.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.290
He's looking at altitude,
airspeed, rate of descent,

00:24:57.290 --> 00:24:58.360
heading.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:03.860
And he's constantly scanning and
adjusting to bring that down.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.090
Those planes were designed
to land on carriers.

00:25:06.090 --> 00:25:08.830
And that meant you slammed
on the end of the runway.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:13.440
And then, that would absorbed a
lot of shock and slow you down.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.925
So one of the goals was to bang.

00:25:14.925 --> 00:25:16.050
That's to slow you down.

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:19.600
You'll see he's going to
make a perfect landing.

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:20.850
Bang on the end of the runway.

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:23.600
The chute pops.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:25.470
Nice landing, OK?

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:28.550
So I needed them to do a
project just like that.

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:32.600
So what I added to the
Making Work Visible,

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.140
that I learned at West Point,
was the burndown chart.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:38.940
So they could see every step
of the way, exactly where they

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.880
were on the glide path.

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.520
Now, after fixing
this business unit,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:51.110
the bank bought a company in
Cambridge, right next to MIT,

00:25:51.110 --> 00:25:53.730
across from the
business school at MIT.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:58.157
A new banking software
company, new technology.

00:25:58.157 --> 00:25:58.990
And so I went there.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:25:59.948
And they had a project.

00:26:02.630 --> 00:26:05.580
Later, I consulted with Bank of
America for the same project.

00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.570
Bank of America was
spending $350 million

00:26:07.570 --> 00:26:10.670
to do what they were doing.

00:26:10.670 --> 00:26:12.720
It was already years late.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:16.040
And they wanted me to fix that.

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.190
We had bigger problems than
just the project planning.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:22.590
Because in order
to get technologies

00:26:22.590 --> 00:26:25.440
that would scale to
multi-billion dollar banks,

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:29.400
we wound up having to do things
like build the first object

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.580
database system for high-volume
transaction processing.

00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:39.080
So I built a technology group
out of guys, from out of MIT.

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.600
We ran them as small teams.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.840
We started building
these new technologies.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.640
And because of my work
with object databases,

00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:51.300
I was hard in to run an
object database company.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:53.155
And I was working away.

00:26:53.155 --> 00:26:56.090
The database company was
right on the campus of MIT.

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:59.260
I was working away in the
object database company.

00:26:59.260 --> 00:27:02.660
And five graduate
students came by.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:06.314
The MIT AI lab was just about
three blocks down the street.

00:27:06.314 --> 00:27:06.855
They came by.

00:27:06.855 --> 00:27:09.140
And they said, "Hey,
we need some lab

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:10.580
space to build our robots.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.270
We're starting up
a robot company,"

00:27:12.270 --> 00:27:15.400
which eventually
became known as iRobot.

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.680
"And you have some lab space.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.930
Will you rent us
a couple of rooms

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:21.320
so we can build our robots?"

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:22.700
I said, "Sure.

00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.270
Why not?

00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:24.920
It's interesting technology.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.230
And we have the space.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.380
We'll make a little
extra money."

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.470
So they're building
these six-legged robots.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.615
And about every other day, the
robot escapes from their lab.

00:27:34.615 --> 00:27:35.360
[LAUGHS]

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.700
Comes walking into my office
trying to hunt me down.

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.960
It had infrared
heat-seeking sensors.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:46.150
And a senior professor at MIT
was supervising the students.

00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:47.210
And he was a co-founder.

00:27:47.210 --> 00:27:49.310
He would come by on Fridays.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.784
One day, one
Friday, I asked him.

00:27:50.784 --> 00:27:52.450
I said, "Professor
Brooks, explain to me

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:54.035
how this robot works."

00:27:54.035 --> 00:27:56.270
And he said, "Well,"
he said, "First

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:59.180
of all, you need to understand,
for 30 years we've tried to do

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.010
build an intelligence
system at MIT.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.460
And it's been a complete
and total failure.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.360
No matter how big
a computer, how big

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.900
a planning system, how big
a database, nothing worked.

00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:11.730
The best we've been able to
do is a smart chess program."

00:28:11.730 --> 00:28:15.460
So he said, "What I've
done is this robot

00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.220
has a chip in every leg that
knows how to move a leg.

00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:21.410
There is no central processor.

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.290
It has a chip in the spine
that can coordinate legs.

00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.300
And it has a neural
network chip in the head

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.862
that figures out what to do."

00:28:27.862 --> 00:28:29.570
He said, "Here's the
neural network chip.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.310
It's blank."

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:33.590
He plugs it into the
robot, flips a switch.

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:37.020
All of a sudden, the legs
start flapping like spaghetti.

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:38.810
And it wobbles to its feet.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.950
And then, it starts walking
around banging into things.

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:44.880
It looks like a baby
learning how to walk.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.480
But within about three minutes,
it's running around the room.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.310
I said, "Wow, that's amazing."

00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:52.060
And he said, "Yeah,
it learns how to walk,

00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.230
for the first time, every
time you turn it on.

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:57.007 --> 00:28:58.090
So I thought for a minute.

00:28:58.090 --> 00:29:00.900
I said, "You know, I used to
have these COBOL programmers,

00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:04.740
back in the bank,
really, really slow.

00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.450
Maybe if we gave them some
simple rules like the robot,

00:29:09.450 --> 00:29:11.480
they could sink their
neural nets every day

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.045
in a daily meeting.

00:29:13.045 --> 00:29:16.070
They could bootstrap up
into a superintelligent,

00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:17.470
high-performing team.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.932
Do you think that would
work, Professor Brooks?"

00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:20.890
He said, "I don't know.

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:22.860
Why don't you try it?"

00:29:22.860 --> 00:29:23.490
So I did.

00:29:23.490 --> 00:29:24.600
It's called Scrum.

00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:27.650
It's a bootstrap.

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:33.440
Now, back when I was a
professor at radiology,

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:38.630
we use to use early computing
PDP-8s for radiation therapy.

00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.520
Anybody ever seen a PDP-8?

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.920
You're probably all too young.

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.570
Maybe?

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:46.650
And those-- yeah,
you saw it in use.

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:50.660
The ones with the paper
tape that starts them up.

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:54.280
The early ones, you had to
feed a paper tape into it.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.450
It had hundreds of
lights on the front.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:57.890
You'd feed paper tape in.

00:29:57.890 --> 00:29:59.120
You'd go [BUZZES].

00:29:59.120 --> 00:29:59.980
And then, whoom.

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:01.438
All the lights
would start dancing.

00:30:01.438 --> 00:30:03.340
It was like magic.

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:08.290
And the paper tape
was the bootstrap.

00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:10.600
So you still have that
bootstrap on your laptop.

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:13.970
It's in the boot
sector on your disk.

00:30:13.970 --> 00:30:17.930
So what I find is about
half of the Scrum teams,

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:22.265
out there in the
world, they change

00:30:22.265 --> 00:30:25.300
in instruction in the BootStrap.

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:27.420
If you went into the boot
sector, on your laptop,

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.300
and you changed a
byte, and then you

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.480
tried to turn on your
laptop, what happens?

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:35.550
The lights don't come on.

00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:36.292
OK?

00:30:36.292 --> 00:30:38.250
So for about half the
Scrum teams in the world,

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:39.710
the lights don't come on.

00:30:39.710 --> 00:30:43.270
But if you run all
the instructions,

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:46.010
the magic happens.

00:30:46.010 --> 00:30:49.505
So we got this working.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:59.030
About this same time, a company,
the first 4GL Language company

00:30:59.030 --> 00:31:02.690
in the world-- I think,
Easel Corporation-- the CEO

00:31:02.690 --> 00:31:07.000
had taken the company from a
stock price of 3 to over 50.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:08.540
And then, the
stock would started

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:13.500
to go down because of
a lot of competition.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:17.460
And so he went and he acquired
a new technology company

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:18.862
in Germany.

00:31:18.862 --> 00:31:20.070
And he came and talked to me.

00:31:20.070 --> 00:31:22.770
And he said, "Jeff,
we need a new product

00:31:22.770 --> 00:31:27.660
suite to replace our whole
4GL Language technology.

00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:29.680
We need it in less
than six months.

00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:32.840
I've bought a German company
that has the base technology.

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:36.110
I need someone like you, that's
built object database systems,

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.830
to come in and figure out how
to get this new product out

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.170
in six months.

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:43.780
We'll give you a small team of
the best people in the company,

00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:46.320
and the base technology.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.340
The Germans have it."

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.550
So it sounded like fun.

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:50.540
So I said, "Sure.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:53.295
Why not?"

00:31:53.295 --> 00:31:54.420
So I come into the company.

00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:58.160
And I watch these guys
working with a prototype

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.710
of the new system.

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:02.730
We figure out we have
really big customers,

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:07.040
like Ford Motor Company,
1,000 IT workers using our 4GL

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:10.780
Language to build all
their internal apps.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:12.280
We work with these
large customers.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:14.420
And we figured out what
they really wanted.

00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:18.470
And what they needed was a
system where they could design,

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.177
what they wanted to
build, using at the time,

00:32:21.177 --> 00:32:23.010
there were many different
object or analysis

00:32:23.010 --> 00:32:24.570
designs, technologies.

00:32:24.570 --> 00:32:27.850
They've all converged,
pretty much, into UML today.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.410
They could create a design.

00:32:29.410 --> 00:32:32.670
And then, the system would
autogenerate all the code,

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:35.670
all the bindings to any
relational database,

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:38.210
an initial version of
the user interface.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.430
Then, they could dive into
the code, change the code.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:43.390
And it would regen the design.

00:32:43.390 --> 00:32:45.525
So the first round-trip
engineering kind

00:32:45.525 --> 00:32:46.150
of environment.

00:32:46.150 --> 00:32:47.600
It still exists today.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:49.390
It's called [? AVI ?] Studio.

00:32:49.390 --> 00:32:52.910
And it's used for wolf
pack programming where

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.052
you can get a dozen
people hacking

00:32:55.052 --> 00:32:56.260
the same code simultaneously.

00:32:58.770 --> 00:33:00.730
I went to a user group
meeting one night.

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:02.590
And in one hour,
we created a game

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:06.143
that you couldn't create in
a week by 12 guys hacking.

00:33:06.143 --> 00:33:06.910
OK?

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.450
On the same code
at the same time.

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:10.875
And it's a small
[? talk-based ?] environment.

00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:14.020
So every time you make a
change, the virtual machine

00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.300
will immediately
boot up and run.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:19.650
So I watched these guys working
in this kind of environment.

00:33:19.650 --> 00:33:23.000
And I notice they're trying to
get this next feature to work.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.617
But sometimes, it'd go
days, sometimes even weeks.

00:33:25.617 --> 00:33:26.575
And they're struggling.

00:33:26.575 --> 00:33:28.530
And it just won't work.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.950
But then, all of a sudden,
like magic, the feature works.

00:33:32.950 --> 00:33:35.480
And I watched that happening.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:38.170
And as a evolutionary
biologist, I

00:33:38.170 --> 00:33:40.710
knew that over at
Harvard University,

00:33:40.710 --> 00:33:42.640
Professor Jay Gould
was writing papers

00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.990
on punctuated equilibrium.

00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:49.380
Now, punctuated
equilibrium tries

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:55.680
to explain why a species can go
a million years with no change.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.670
And then, all of a
sudden it changes.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:03.910
And over at Thinking Machines,
one of the first supercomputer

00:34:03.910 --> 00:34:07.670
companies, Danny
Hillis was working

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.860
with Harvard and modeling on
the supercomputer, a highly

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:12.850
parallel processing
supercomputer.

00:34:12.850 --> 00:34:14.719
What happened?

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:18.559
If a squirrel goes a million
years before it pops out

00:34:18.559 --> 00:34:21.030
of our trees and
flies, what happens

00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:23.460
to the squirrel, in
the million years?

00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:26.590
What's going on when you
don't see any change?

00:34:26.590 --> 00:34:29.880
And what he was able to
simulate, on the computer,

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:34.520
was that multiple parts
of the organ systems

00:34:34.520 --> 00:34:36.440
make subtle changes.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.949
And only one five or six
different major organ systems

00:34:39.949 --> 00:34:43.440
reconfigure themselves
in exactly the right way

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.570
does, all of a sudden, the
squirrel fly out of the tree.

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:52.210
So I said, "Guys, what
you're seeing here

00:34:52.210 --> 00:34:53.880
is punctuated equilibrium.

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:55.830
But it's in software.

00:34:55.830 --> 00:34:58.840
So we need to stop trying
to create new features.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:04.940
What we need to do
is ask ourselves,

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.710
what is the smallest
change we can

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:10.480
make to push the system
in the right direction?

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.975
And we need to make, understand
the component architecture

00:35:12.975 --> 00:35:16.685
of the software, and make that
change in the right component.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:20.540
We make that change.

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.450
The system runs.

00:35:21.450 --> 00:35:22.130
We look at it.

00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.630
We say, OK.

00:35:22.630 --> 00:35:27.320
What is the next smallest
change we should make?"

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.100
The only people that
have understood this,

00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.490
in the last 20 years, are
the Google guys in New York.

00:35:32.490 --> 00:35:34.490
They grilled me for
four hours one night.

00:35:34.490 --> 00:35:36.090
And they would not
give up until they

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:39.270
found the secret sauce of Scrum.

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:42.690
So maybe some of you will
pick it up here in London.

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:45.770
If you do this, the
features will pop out,

00:35:45.770 --> 00:35:49.020
like magic, in less
than 20% of the time.

00:35:52.510 --> 00:35:55.050
If you can do that,
you become invincible.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.510
Nobody can compete against you.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:36:01.900
Now, the other thing
that we had to change

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.260
was as we were building
this system and the tooling,

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.900
that people are going
to use the system,

00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:10.600
we were working on the
organizational structure.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.710
How should the
team be organized?

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.770
How should it run?

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.570
And we knew there were
three major problems.

00:36:18.570 --> 00:36:21.680
One is Conway's law.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.280
The structure of
the organization we

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.790
reflect in the code.

00:36:24.790 --> 00:36:27.700
So we knew Ford Motor Company
had a hierarchical command

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.750
and control culture.

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.200
So that meant the code would
be hierarchical command

00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.100
and control.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.410
That meant it would be
a complete violation

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:36.760
of a good object design.

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:39.670
It would be brittle
code, hard to maintain,

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:42.295
impossible to refactor.

00:36:42.295 --> 00:36:44.000
You'd build out an
architecture that

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.400
would lock you in concrete.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:48.120
So the next feature that
needed an architectural change,

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.490
it was impossible.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.500
So we had to create a
organizational structure that

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.430
would get around Conway's law.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.150
The second thing we had to
deal with was Brooks' law.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:03.540
Brooks' law says as you
increase the team size,

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:04.790
it delays the project.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:08.920
In fact, we had data from
hundreds of projects showing

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:12.030
that if you take a team
of six that takes a year

00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:15.850
to do a project, if you
add four people to the team

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:21.860
and make it 10, then
they will take 18 months

00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:23.290
to do the 12-month project.

00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:28.400
Add four people, delays
the project for six months.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:32.390
So we knew the team size
had to be down around.

00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:34.930
We didn't know the magic
number 4.6 at the time.

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:41.240
But we knew six people or less
was probably the right number.

00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:43.360
The third thing we
had to deal with

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.380
was what Peter Drucker,
who invented management--

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.390
the concept of management--
called the Cuckoo Effect.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.200
In a great book he wrote
on entrepreneurship

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.570
and innovation, he has a
chapter on the Cuckoo Effect.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.700
And that is if you do any
innovation inside a company,

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:06.480
except for Google, it will be
perceived as an alien organism,

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.540
like a bacteria or virus.

00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.520
And all the antibodies
of the corporate culture

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.115
will rise up and try to
crush it immediately.

00:38:14.115 --> 00:38:15.570
OK?

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:20.130
Now, as a pilot I knew about
Lockheed's Skunk Works.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:22.120
And what Lockheed did
was take a bunch of guys

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.260
and put them in the
desert, in California,

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:26.450
where nobody could bother them.

00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:27.950
And then, they could
build something

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:31.480
like the SR-71, or the
first stealth bomber,

00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:35.360
in 10% of the time
at 10% of the cost.

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.890
But I needed a system
that would actually

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:41.156
work inside corporate
headquarters.

00:38:41.156 --> 00:38:46.190
And so the way Scrum teams
are conceived and operate,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:51.160
they're able to evade the immune
response of the corporation.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.320
Because in the early days,
nobody ever approved Scrum.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.460
OK?

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.250
It was always stealth
Scrum implementation

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:02.840
by developers who wanted
a better way of working.

00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:06.210
And so we need to build it out
so that it would infinitely

00:39:06.210 --> 00:39:07.530
scale.

00:39:07.530 --> 00:39:11.370
And these double
circles are like,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:12.790
we call the Scrum of Scrums.

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:15.550
It's really a virtual
team that coordinates

00:39:15.550 --> 00:39:18.450
the activities of
multiple teams.

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:21.216
So you can think of one
of them being Google Maps,

00:39:21.216 --> 00:39:22.840
as a bunch of teams
making Google Maps.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.464
But then, there's
another team up here,

00:39:24.464 --> 00:39:28.750
like Zillow, who's using Google
Maps to add real estate prices.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:30.530
And then, maybe
somebody's using Zillow.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:33.990
So it enables a huge match-up.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:37.740
This is, basically, the way
the internet is running, right?

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:40.850
So this organizational structure
became really important.

00:39:40.850 --> 00:39:42.985
How do you scale Scrum?

00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:50.080
Now after all of this was
pretty much put together,

00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:53.404
we needed a way to explain
it to Ford Motor Company.

00:39:53.404 --> 00:39:55.070
So we started researching
the literature

00:39:55.070 --> 00:39:56.920
and went through
hundreds of papers.

00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:01.720
The best one we found was by
the world's leading experts

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.380
on knowledge generation and
teams, Professors Nonaka

00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:06.260
and Takeuchi.

00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:09.450
And they had written a paper
in 1986 called "The New New

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.680
Product Development Game"
in which they described

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:15.270
three major styles of
project management.

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:19.740
Type A was the way NASA built
rockets and the space shuttle.

00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.880
Big requirements,
documents handed off

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.434
to the analysis team.

00:40:25.434 --> 00:40:27.100
Took them years to
get the requirements.

00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.016
Then, the analysis team
would take more years,

00:40:29.016 --> 00:40:32.030
another big document, hand
it off to the design team.

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:35.180
More big documents, more
years, into implementation,

00:40:35.180 --> 00:40:38.480
more years into testing,
more years into deployment.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:41.350
10 to 15 years later,
the rocket launches.

00:40:41.350 --> 00:40:42.810
It blows up on the pad.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:49.465
Go back to step one
and do it again.

00:40:49.465 --> 00:40:51.490
Nonaka and Takeuchi
were consultants

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:52.930
to Japanese management teams.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.990
They brought Fuji's
Xerox management to NASA,

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:57.670
showed them how they worked.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:01.220
And Fuji Xerox came back
and tried to implement that.

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:02.720
But, of course, as
soon as they did,

00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.520
it's a fundamentally
flawed model.

00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:06.120
We know today, the
failure rate is

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.130
86% with this traditional
model of project management.

00:41:09.130 --> 00:41:11.960
So they immediately
started getting failures.

00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:15.180
But the Japanese had been
trained by Edwards Deming,

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:18.810
after World War II, to do root
cause analysis of failures.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:22.390
And what they found was
big documents, handed off

00:41:22.390 --> 00:41:27.040
between departments, causes four
out of five projects to fail.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.960
So they banned big documents.

00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.570
And they banned hand-offs.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:34.240
And went to what they called
the Sashimi-style of project

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:34.740
management.

00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.830
Everybody's face-to-face
all the way through.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:40.650
But the best teams, Nonaki
and Takeuchi found, at places

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:43.260
like Honda, Toyota, 3M
in the United States,

00:41:43.260 --> 00:41:46.590
lean companies where the
teams were cross-functional,

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:48.840
working so closely together.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:51.127
In Paris, there
are Google teams.

00:41:51.127 --> 00:41:52.460
They sit around a table all day.

00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:55.180
They have a Scrumboard.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:57.270
Whenever anyone comes
free, they go immediately

00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:59.250
to the top story on the
board and work on it.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:01.580
It doesn't matter whether
they know it or not.

00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:03.130
If you don't know
it, you learn it.

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:04.060
OK?

00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.310
So everybody knows
everything on the team.

00:42:06.310 --> 00:42:09.730
That's the way
Toyota builds cars.

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:11.530
If there is any
impediment, that goes

00:42:11.530 --> 00:42:12.880
to the top story on the board.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:17.050
And the team works
on that first.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:21.040
Radical cross-fertilization,
radical impediment removal.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:22.920
You might go visit
these guys, in Paris,

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.650
if you're not doing that.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:26.365
Really fast team if you do that.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.190
They called Type B and
Type C, reminded them

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:37.110
of the game of rugby and the
scrum formation in rugby.

00:42:37.110 --> 00:42:39.650
So they said, we're going
to call this Scrum Project

00:42:39.650 --> 00:42:40.580
Management.

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.630
So we said, that's it.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:44.100
We'll call it Scrum
Project Management.

00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.970
And then, when we talked to
Ford Motor Company executives,

00:42:46.970 --> 00:42:48.420
we say it comes from Toyota.

00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:51.126
It's a car company
just like you guys.

00:42:51.126 --> 00:42:54.410
And so it'll be believable.

00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:59.710
And in there, they noted that
all of these teams, the best

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:01.290
teams, had three
things in common.

00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:06.580
One, transcendent goals like
the Prius team at Toyota.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.660
The goal is to start
greening the planet,

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:11.830
get twice the gas mileage.

00:43:11.830 --> 00:43:14.280
All these teams had autonomy.

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:15.440
They chose their work.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:17.390
They decided how to do the work.

00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:19.860
Nobody's micromanaging
their work.

00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:23.490
And through cross-fertilization
and cross-learning,

00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:26.600
they booted up into
super-performing teams.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.050
And that's an
exhilarating feeling

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:31.820
when you want a great team.

00:43:31.820 --> 00:43:35.400
So this transcendent goals,
it's all about a better life

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:39.540
for the world and
for the people.

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.590
Google kind of has that.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:42.170
Do no evil.

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:45.040
How's that working here?

00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:48.665
Autonomy, you have a lot
of autonomy here at Google.

00:43:48.665 --> 00:43:50.790
I don't know how well you're
working in teams here.

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:51.870
It doesn't sound
like you're working

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.360
as well as the guys in Paris.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:56.654
I'm looking at your faces
when I talked about that.

00:43:56.654 --> 00:43:57.620
OK?

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.550
Real team performance
requires real collaboration.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:05.980
So life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness,

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.921
having a great time, is
fundamental to Scrum.

00:44:09.921 --> 00:44:10.420
OK?

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.220
And it's based on Lean
product development at Toyota.

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.886
We've been meeting
with the Lean people.

00:44:16.886 --> 00:44:18.530
I just came from a
Lean IT conference.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:21.729
And they say what
Takeuchi and Nonaki

00:44:21.729 --> 00:44:24.020
were looking at was Lean
product development at Toyota.

00:44:27.570 --> 00:44:32.000
So this was all done
in 1993-94 time frame.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.530
In 1995, I called up
my buddy, Ken Schwaber.

00:44:36.530 --> 00:44:38.730
He was CEO of a project
management software company.

00:44:38.730 --> 00:44:39.860
I said, "Ken, I want
you come in and look

00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:41.465
at this new way of working.

00:44:41.465 --> 00:44:44.050
You know, those methodologies
with the Gantt charts

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:45.560
you're selling, they don't work.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.510
But I've got something
that really works."

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.551
And he came in and spent
two weeks with the team.

00:44:49.551 --> 00:44:51.620
And he said, "You're right."

00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.320
So I said, "What I want you
do to Ken is start to--"

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:56.080
I was working internal
of the company.

00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.230
"I want you to go out and
promote this in the industry.

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.320
We need to make it
open-source-- free.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.050
And so he agreed to do that.

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:10.630
Six years later, we
wind up, in 2001,

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:15.190
at a meeting of 17 experts
on what they called,

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:17.350
at that time,
lightweight processes.

00:45:17.350 --> 00:45:21.470
The main processes were Scrum
and extreme programming.

00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:23.620
And one of the
Scrum guys had read

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.510
this book called
"Agile Competitors".

00:45:25.510 --> 00:45:29.297
100 hardware companies
who were lean.

00:45:29.297 --> 00:45:31.130
But what they added was
customer involvement

00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:32.750
in product creation.

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.450
They call that Agile.

00:45:35.450 --> 00:45:37.960
And so he argued
that we should call

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.700
what we're doing
in software Agile

00:45:39.700 --> 00:45:41.900
That's where Agile came from.

00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:46.930
And the second day of the
meeting, during a break, Martin

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:49.462
Fowler-- famous author--
went to the board.

00:45:49.462 --> 00:45:50.920
Actually, nine of
the guys went out

00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:53.540
on the ski slope, eight
of us back in the room.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.430
Martin says, "It'd
be really good

00:45:56.430 --> 00:45:58.940
if we could agree on
something before we leave.

00:45:58.940 --> 00:46:01.230
Because we've all been
arguing and debating.

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:03.290
What can we agree on?"

00:46:03.290 --> 00:46:07.360
Well, the first thing we
agreed on was teams were,

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:11.060
great teams were the
most important thing.

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:13.340
And Bell Labs had done
10 years of research

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.040
showing that the
interactions of the teams

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.900
was what produced great
performance and great product.

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.980
And we said it's not that we
don't like processes and tools.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.880
But the teams are
much more important.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:27.840
Process and tools
can slow you down.

00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.860
The second thing
we agreed on was

00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.810
having working software
in short increments,

00:46:32.810 --> 00:46:35.792
and deploying it, and
getting feedback is critical.

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:37.750
It's not that we don't
need some documentation.

00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:41.080
In fact, today, we know
for a medical device,

00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:43.370
you need 5% of the
documentation that people

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:48.080
used to have for FDA compliance.

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.340
So you need some
documentation, but a lot less.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.400
The third we agreed on is that
getting the customer involved

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:55.820
in the creation of the product,
when Scrum is the product

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:58.570
owner, is critical.

00:46:58.570 --> 00:47:00.180
And the fourth
thing was responding

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:02.280
to change over following a plan.

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:04.105
We wrote all this in 15 minutes.

00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:12.040
After the break, the other
nine guys come back in.

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:15.215
Ward Cunningham, one
of the XP founders,

00:47:15.215 --> 00:47:16.480
the inventor of the wiki.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.480
There's a great article,
this week in the press,

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:21.410
on how Ward helped
to create Wikipedia.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:22.750
Because he invented the wiki.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:24.900
He also invented the user story.

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.020
He invented FitNesse,
one of the acceptance

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:30.940
test-driven development tooling.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:33.790
He was kind of the
lead technical guy.

00:47:33.790 --> 00:47:34.380
He walked in.

00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.160
His mouth dropped.

00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:35.826
He looked at it.

00:47:35.826 --> 00:47:37.330
He said, "That's awesome."

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.650
And not a single
word was changed.

00:47:40.650 --> 00:47:46.160
So 15 minutes we published this.

00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:50.010
And the whole world
started to get Agile.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:53.710
So major changes going on.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:58.490
And what's happened is it's
changed the way people work.

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.360
So here's the worst
project in the world today.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:06.140
It's $143 billion
over budget, the F-35.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.640
The latest delay is 13-month
delay because of testing.

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.330
And last month, one
caught fire on the runway.

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:14.160
They were all grounded.

00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.420
Here's the best
airplane in the world.

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:22.070
My company is consultant to
Saab Defense, the Saab Gripen.

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.150
They build it with Scrum.

00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:26.196
Every six months, there's
a new major release

00:48:26.196 --> 00:48:27.570
of the operating
system, which is

00:48:27.570 --> 00:48:29.080
like a new release of Windows.

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:31.080
It's probably as big as Windows.

00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.524
But along with that new
release is all new hardware.

00:48:33.524 --> 00:48:35.940
So every six months, they have
a new version of the plane.

00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:37.000
It's faster.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.360
It's lighter.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.830
It's cheaper.

00:48:39.830 --> 00:48:42.440
It has better technologies,
better radar, better targeting

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.460
systems.

00:48:44.460 --> 00:48:49.700
By today, it's three
generations ahead of the F-35.

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.450
It is, also, the
cheapest aircraft

00:48:51.450 --> 00:48:54.910
in the world-- less than
20% of the life-cycle cost

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.790
of the F-35.

00:48:55.790 --> 00:49:00.230
Less than 20% to buy and
less than 20% to maintain.

00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:03.960
And we're seeing that in many
different hardware scenarios.

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.340
For example, in
the middle there,

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:09.440
you can see a John Deere piece
of agricultural equipment.

00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:12.810
In John Deere, they use Scrum
to manufacture that stuff.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:16.310
They get 700% or 800%
improvement in productivity.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:19.320
And what we're
seeing consistently

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.690
is that the price tends to
drop to 20% of the competitors'

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:25.040
prices.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.900
So Scrum is spreading
outside of software

00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.440
back into hardware
where it started.

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.467
It's also spreading
across domains.

00:49:32.467 --> 00:49:34.800
You can see, down in the
bottom picture, is Joe Justice.

00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:36.270
He runs our Hardware Practice.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:37.896
He's coaching a car company.

00:49:37.896 --> 00:49:39.395
They build cars in
one-week sprints.

00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:44.291
But it's spreading
out in Silicon Valley.

00:49:44.291 --> 00:49:45.290
I had a group like this.

00:49:45.290 --> 00:49:48.050
I said, "How many have run
your wedding by Scrum?"

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:49.370
Six people raise their hand.

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:52.360
Anybody run a wedding
by Scrum in here?

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:54.170
It's great for weddings.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:57.740
But the leading implementation
of Scrum today, in the world,

00:49:57.740 --> 00:50:00.320
is in education.

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.880
And we see this both
in US and Europe.

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.180
But the best implementation is
eduScrum in the Netherlands.

00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:09.265
And I visited the
school where it started.

00:50:09.265 --> 00:50:12.730
It's a high school, teenagers.

00:50:12.730 --> 00:50:14.692
And the bell rings.

00:50:14.692 --> 00:50:16.400
And the kids come
running into the class.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.570
They're in teams of four.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:20.790
And they have these Scrumboards,
you can see in the slide,

00:50:20.790 --> 00:50:21.920
with sticky notes.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:24.280
They immediately run to the
wall, put it up on the wall,

00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.224
have a daily meeting.

00:50:25.224 --> 00:50:26.640
It's usually less
than 10 minutes.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:29.090
They ran to their seat
and start working.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.637
The teacher just
stands there watching.

00:50:31.637 --> 00:50:32.970
He says, "I'm the product owner.

00:50:32.970 --> 00:50:35.910
I don't get to talk
unless I have a question."

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:37.690
I just ask them, make
sure they're done,

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:40.410
when they're done
with the assignments."

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:43.190
I asked the kids is it more fun
doing this than the old way?

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:44.250
And they said, "Yes."

00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.150
They all screamed, "Yes."

00:50:46.150 --> 00:50:48.900
They said, "We have a definition
of fun for every story

00:50:48.900 --> 00:50:51.965
in addition to a
definition of done."

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:53.340
I said, "What
about your grades?"

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:55.940
They said, "Well, on a
scale of one to 10--"

00:50:55.940 --> 00:50:57.510
which they do in
the Netherlands,

00:50:57.510 --> 00:51:01.710
the average grade is 5
in the Waterfall classes.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.100
But in the Scrum
classes, it's over 7.

00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:08.190
So really significant
grade and performance.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:09.220
How about speed?

00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.820
They said, "We
finished weeks early

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:14.204
compared to the
rest of classes."

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:15.620
One of the most
interesting things

00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:19.450
I noticed was a handicapped
girl, in a wheelchair,

00:51:19.450 --> 00:51:20.327
came wheeling in.

00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.660
She's right into the daily
meeting, running to the desk,

00:51:22.660 --> 00:51:25.040
with a wheelchair, just
like everybody else.

00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.330
And totally involved as a
First Class Citizen, working.

00:51:28.330 --> 00:51:30.970
And they told me she can only
be there two days a week.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:32.680
But because of the
way Scrum works,

00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:35.780
it just totally
gets them engaged.

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.640
And one of the kids,
who had been autistic

00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:42.610
and could hardly talk to anyone
two years earlier, he said,

00:51:42.610 --> 00:51:45.329
"Autistic kids are
real valuable players,

00:51:45.329 --> 00:51:46.870
on these Scrum teams,
because they're

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:49.577
great at visualization
and planning."

00:51:49.577 --> 00:51:51.160
And he said, "I
became a ScrumMaster."

00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.990
And he described
what he was doing

00:51:52.990 --> 00:51:54.970
and how he was leading the team.

00:51:54.970 --> 00:51:56.470
This kid, who could
hardly talk, had

00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:58.910
become a great
communicator and a leader.

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:02.880
It absolutely
transforms the kids.

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:05.770
And the teachers say
virtually all motivation

00:52:05.770 --> 00:52:07.720
and disciplinary
problems just go away.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.870
The teams are self-managing.

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:12.990
One of the girls said, "I
went home for family dinner

00:52:12.990 --> 00:52:14.450
a couple of weeks ago.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:17.290
And my father was
really depressed."

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:19.800
And the family asked him,
"Why are you so depressed,

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.810
Dad?' And he said, 'They
implemented Scrum in my IT

00:52:22.810 --> 00:52:23.926
group today.'"

00:52:23.926 --> 00:52:24.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:27.647
So the daughter says,
"Well, how did they do it?

00:52:27.647 --> 00:52:28.480
What are you doing?"

00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:29.146
And he explains.

00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:31.129
She said, "You're doing
it all wrong, Dad.

00:52:31.129 --> 00:52:32.420
[CHUCKLES] You have to do this.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.060
You have to that.

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:33.726
You have to do."

00:52:33.726 --> 00:52:36.150
So, in the future,
your children are

00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:39.160
going to be training you
how to have better teams,

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:43.250
here at Google, if we can
get into the UK [CHUCKLES]

00:52:43.250 --> 00:52:44.410
school system.

00:52:44.410 --> 00:52:49.220
So all of these stories,
and many more, this book

00:52:49.220 --> 00:52:53.000
is really a book
that's beyond IT.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.860
The goal was more than 80%
of the stories outside of IT,

00:52:56.860 --> 00:52:58.650
where Scrum is going.

00:52:58.650 --> 00:53:00.910
And all these
stories that really

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.580
are the background of Scrum
and where it comes from.

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:06.080
Because it has nothing
to do with software.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.280
It comes out of fighter
pilot experience,

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:14.900
and evolutionary biology,
and supercomputing modeling,

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:17.870
AI-- that's where it
all comes from-- capped

00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:22.430
by the Total Lean product
development experience.

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.540
So I think you got books
for everybody, right?

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:28.329
So I hope you read and enjoy it.

00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:30.120
YVONNE: Yes, we have
books for those of you

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:32.270
who came early and sat up front.

00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:33.638
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:37.070
We have time for just
a couple of questions.

00:53:37.070 --> 00:53:38.590
And I'm going to ask
you to use the mikes.

00:53:38.590 --> 00:53:39.173
Any questions?

00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:46.516
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:53:46.516 --> 00:53:48.056
So I've been using Scrum a bit.

00:53:48.056 --> 00:53:49.180
And I've really enjoyed it.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:55.640
And my question was about the
burndown for one-week sprints.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.120
What's the value of that?

00:53:57.120 --> 00:53:59.480
Because it was the
Schwaber 30 Days,

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.400
you could get some
kind of trajectory.

00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.840
But when you only
have five days,

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.640
it's very hard to
correct something

00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:08.610
that's gone out of when you've
only had two or three days.

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:10.965
There's not a lot of
opportunity to change.

00:54:10.965 --> 00:54:12.590
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND:
That's what people

00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:14.690
say when they're
starting off with Scrum.

00:54:14.690 --> 00:54:19.460
But in my company, we run our
company completely by Scrum.

00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.860
We run all in one-week sprints.

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:25.920
We use some tooling
because we have

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.890
a lot of distributed people.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.060
It has a burnup
instead of a burndown.

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:31.905
But it gives us quite
a good visualization

00:54:31.905 --> 00:54:34.280
of what's going on.

00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:36.610
But for a lot of
companies today,

00:54:36.610 --> 00:54:38.559
particularly Google
in Mountain View,

00:54:38.559 --> 00:54:40.100
I don't know how
you're working here.

00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:42.520
You're in a continuous
delivery mode.

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.960
So you figure out how much you
deliver this week-- burning it

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:47.402
up.

00:54:47.402 --> 00:54:48.360
Is that happening here?

00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.070
Are you guys delivery stuff
every day to production?

00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.360
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND: Yeah.

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.670
So you just burnup for a week.

00:54:57.670 --> 00:55:01.040
Most companies today don't
use four-week sprints anymore.

00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.960
I mean, Ken still likes 30 days.

00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:07.602
But probably 70% of Scrums
today have two weeks.

00:55:07.602 --> 00:55:09.510
A few three weeks.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:10.530
A few, one week.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.260
We find that one-week
sprints are more intense.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:19.710
So you have to have a
team that wants to really

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:21.540
be focused and disciplined.

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.240
And if you do that on the weekly
cycle, you get more learning.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:30.900
It's really the learning cycle
that propels the product.

00:55:33.345 --> 00:55:33.886
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:55:33.886 --> 00:55:35.677
I've worked at a couple
different companies

00:55:35.677 --> 00:55:36.900
that have done Scrum.

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:39.480
And there seems to quite a
vastly different interpretation

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.694
from company to company.

00:55:41.694 --> 00:55:43.360
Was that kind of the
intention of Scrum?

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.360
Were you leaving it very
open to interpretation?

00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:46.960
Or do you find
that Scrum is kind

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:49.130
of misrepresented
by some companies?

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:53.400
Well, the Scrum Guide,
we try to keep minimal,

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.010
the middle framework.

00:55:56.010 --> 00:56:00.751
But the misinterpretations
that we see are really extreme.

00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:02.500
About half of the Scrum
teams in the world

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.470
can't deliver anything.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:07.265
And so they're not
doing it the way Ken

00:56:07.265 --> 00:56:09.920
and I are talking about.

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:13.520
We have Scrum teams that
are spending a year doing

00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:17.920
two-week sprints for
requirements for six months.

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.520
And then, two-week
sprints for coding

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.212
with no testing
for three months.

00:56:23.212 --> 00:56:24.420
And then, they're never done.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:26.844
So the project's always
late by this time.

00:56:26.844 --> 00:56:28.010
And they think that's Scrum.

00:56:28.010 --> 00:56:32.566
So people totally misinterpret
what we're talking about.

00:56:32.566 --> 00:56:36.100
Yeah, it's nothing we can do
about that other than-- it

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.796
makes for a lot of
coaching business.

00:56:37.796 --> 00:56:38.420
It's a lot of--

00:56:38.420 --> 00:56:39.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:39.290 --> 00:56:41.470
Scrum coaches out there
that have good jobs.

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:44.689
[CHUCKLES]

00:56:44.689 --> 00:56:46.480
YVONNE: We have time
for one last question.

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.270
AUDIENCE: I got a mike.

00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.490
Hi.

00:56:47.490 --> 00:56:48.448
So thank you very much.

00:56:48.448 --> 00:56:51.530
That was a really great
and motivational talk.

00:56:51.530 --> 00:56:53.951
So kudos for that.

00:56:53.951 --> 00:56:55.950
But for those of us who
didn't come early enough

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:58.033
to sit in the front row
to get a book-- [CHUCKLES]

00:56:58.033 --> 00:56:58.692
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:58.692 --> 00:57:00.650
--or for those of us who
are just new to Scrum,

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:04.140
could you maybe
just go into what

00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:06.112
that recipe is to
make the secret sauce?

00:57:06.112 --> 00:57:07.820
I mean, just really
just bang through it.

00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:11.213
You'd said the BootStrapping, if
you'd just describe that to us.

00:57:11.213 --> 00:57:12.212
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND: OK.

00:57:12.212 --> 00:57:14.200
the BootStrap is
the Scrum Guide.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.000
And often, people say why
do we have to do this?

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:21.150
You need a list of stuff to
do that's in a ready state.

00:57:21.150 --> 00:57:24.590
That means it's immediately
actionable and it's small.

00:57:24.590 --> 00:57:27.620
So you have to do
whatever needs to be

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.870
done before you enter
into that sprint.

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:33.460
If that's not clear,
then you have a mess.

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.080
OK, so that's the first secret.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:39.100
The second secret is when
you start into that sprint,

00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.550
you want to take just
enough, and not too much,

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:45.620
so that you can cleanly
complete it in the sprint.

00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:47.230
The reason being
we have discovered,

00:57:47.230 --> 00:57:48.688
I work for a venture
capital group.

00:57:48.688 --> 00:57:51.550
And after running
thousands of sprints,

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:55.050
we have found that teams
that finish the sprint early,

00:57:55.050 --> 00:57:58.750
with everything down and
working, accelerate faster.

00:57:58.750 --> 00:58:01.530
So the kind of improvement
that we're looking for

00:58:01.530 --> 00:58:05.260
requires you to cleanly
finish and, in your case,

00:58:05.260 --> 00:58:08.060
you should be able to deploy
in whatever sprint [? likes ?]

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:09.087
you're having.

00:58:09.087 --> 00:58:10.670
So you don't want
to take too much in.

00:58:10.670 --> 00:58:13.770
So that sprint planning,
It can be one minute.

00:58:13.770 --> 00:58:16.630
But you need to make a decision
to take the right things in

00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:18.227
and not too much.

00:58:18.227 --> 00:58:20.560
AUDIENCE: Well, when you're
talking about one week, that

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:23.684
almost sounds like a Gantt
chart style planning.

00:58:23.684 --> 00:58:26.100
So, really, the one week is
kind of like a rough estimate.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.890
If this is how much work we
should get done in one week,

00:58:28.890 --> 00:58:30.172
and now it's like, let's
just burn through it.

00:58:30.172 --> 00:58:32.130
Or are you really looking
at one week and then,

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:33.952
either coming in early or late?

00:58:33.952 --> 00:58:34.952
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND: No.

00:58:38.610 --> 00:58:41.950
This is a long discussion
about planning.

00:58:41.950 --> 00:58:44.870
But for a lot of
things in Google,

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:46.860
you don't care when
it comes out, right?

00:58:46.860 --> 00:58:48.740
It comes out when it comes out.

00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:51.759
But for some projects,
people need to plan.

00:58:51.759 --> 00:58:52.800
And they need to predict.

00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:55.470
And the product owner needs
to be able to give dates.

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:56.840
This happened in AdWords.

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.830
That's why they implemented
Scrum in AdWords many years

00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:00.770
ago.

00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:03.070
Because they need to
be more predictable.

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:06.010
There were millions of
people using AdWords.

00:59:06.010 --> 00:59:07.820
So in order to get
that, the product owner

00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.050
needs to know a
velocity of production.

00:59:10.050 --> 00:59:13.680
And he gets that off
the sprint cycle.

00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.800
Also, we find that people
that cleanly finish work,

00:59:16.800 --> 00:59:19.560
in a cycle, need to take
the right amount in.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.990
So knowing what they can
do is important to get

00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:27.090
in this rhythm of
a planning cycle.

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:29.640
People often think, well we can
just do one thing at a time.

00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:32.540
We'll just do one thing at a
time and don't worry about it.

00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.079
Those teams don't go as fast.

00:59:34.079 --> 00:59:35.620
People had said,
OK, this week, we're

00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.750
going to get this stuff done.

00:59:36.750 --> 00:59:37.130
Bang.

00:59:37.130 --> 00:59:37.530
And they get it done.

00:59:37.530 --> 00:59:38.840
Then next week, we're
going to get more done.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.480
Bang, and they get that done.

00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.390
Those teams really accelerate.

00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:46.260
It's like winning soccer game.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.542
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:59:47.542 --> 00:59:48.750
I'm just going to keep going.

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:50.972
So kind of like your
punctuated equilibrium thing.

00:59:50.972 --> 00:59:52.680
So when you're looking
at this, it really

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.940
should be a small
change that you

00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.476
can do in one week,
which is setting you off

00:59:55.476 --> 00:59:56.165
in the right direction.

00:59:56.165 --> 00:59:56.420
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND:
That's right.

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:58.926
AUDIENCE: No change should
take more than the sprint.

00:59:58.926 --> 01:00:00.051
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND: Right.

01:00:00.051 --> 01:00:01.537
Exactly.

01:00:01.537 --> 01:00:02.120
YVONNE: Great.

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:02.490
OK.

01:00:02.490 --> 01:00:03.781
So we're going to end it there.

01:00:03.781 --> 01:00:06.737
We, actually, will have copies
of our books in the libraries.

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:08.570
And I'd like to say
thank you thank to Jeff.

01:00:08.570 --> 01:00:08.800
DR. JEFF SUTHERLAND: OK.

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.883
Thank you for inviting me.

01:00:09.883 --> 01:00:11.550
[APPLAUSE]
