00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.989
Imagine you’re being attacked 
by a ferocious predator.

00:00:09.989 --> 00:00:11.811
With no chance of escape,

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.468
you do what any courageous, 
self-respecting possum would do:

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:18.269
curl into an immobile 
state called catatonia,

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:19.755
stick out your tongue,

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:20.811
drool,

00:00:20.811 --> 00:00:24.989
and ooze some foul-smelling 
liquid from your anal glands.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.138
Disgusted, your assailant 
loosens its grip,

00:00:28.138 --> 00:00:30.978
decides you’re not the dinner 
it was looking for,

00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:32.290
and departs.

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.538
After 10 minutes, 
you resurrect and merrily saunter on.

00:00:36.538 --> 00:00:38.359
From lemurs to lizards,

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:39.833
ants to amphibians,

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:41.562
sharks to chickens,

00:00:41.562 --> 00:00:45.520
hundreds of animals
"play dead" as a survival tactic.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.209
Nicknamed "playing possum" 
after its star performer,

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:52.773
feigning death is also called thanatosis.

00:00:52.773 --> 00:00:56.609
That’s from Thanatos, 
the ancient Greek deity of death.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.678
But most scientists call it 
tonic immobility, or TI.

00:01:00.678 --> 00:01:06.007
How and why TI occurs depends 
on the species and situation.

00:01:06.007 --> 00:01:12.129
Spewing stench and adopting odd postures
are common and often play important roles.

00:01:12.129 --> 00:01:14.097
Other animals sacrifice their neighbors:

00:01:14.097 --> 00:01:17.631
quail chicks that freeze 
while their kin run amok

00:01:17.631 --> 00:01:21.054
have a better chance of survival 
when pursued by a cat.

00:01:21.054 --> 00:01:25.520
Speaking of cats, feline mothers can pinch
the napes of their kittens’ necks

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.471
and induce another kind of 
immobility called clipnosis.

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:33.060
This keeps their kittens quiet 
and easy to transport.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.559
Most of the physiological mechanisms 
underlying these theatrics

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:40.380
originate in 
the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.559
better known for controlling cycles 
of resting and digesting.

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:45.938
In possums,

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:50.840
the parasympathetic nervous system causes
their heart rates to drop by nearly half,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.018
respiration by a third,

00:01:53.018 --> 00:01:58.000
and body temperatures by more than half a
degree Celsius for up to an hour.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.700
The neurotransmitter dopamine 
also plays a part.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.888
Flour beetles with low dopamine levels 
play dead more frequently

00:02:05.888 --> 00:02:07.450
than those with high levels,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.970
and anything blocking dopamine receptor 
sites can lengthen catatonia.

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.778
But maintaining a death ruse isn’t easy.

00:02:14.778 --> 00:02:17.789
The performers are constantly 
gauging their surroundings

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.529
for cues on when it’s safe to rise.

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.589
Chickens, for instance, can sense
when a predator’s eyes are upon them.

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:28.919
Researchers know this because when they
used a stuffed hawk in an experiment,

00:02:28.919 --> 00:02:32.068
their chicken subjects came out of their
catatonia quicker

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:35.348
when the hawk’s eyes were averted.

00:02:35.348 --> 00:02:39.287
Other animals use TI for purposes 
other than defense.

00:02:39.287 --> 00:02:41.639
When the sleeper cichlid feels peckish,

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.354
it sinks to the lake floor 
and lies motionless,

00:02:45.354 --> 00:02:49.649
its splotchy coloration making it 
seem like a rotting carcass.

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:54.070
If a small scavenger investigates, 
this undead trickster strikes.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.520
Some animals even feign death 
as a sexual ploy.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.509
Male nursery spiders offer gifts of
silk-wrapped insects

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:03.657
in hopes of wooing females.

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:07.470
But those females are known 
to eat love-seeking males.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.390
By playing dead while the female 
eagerly devours her snack,

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.940
these males can cautiously revive

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.669
and improve their chances 
of successfully mating.

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:23.070
So TI can work to an animal’s advantage,
unless someone else knows its secret.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.489
California orcas can flip over 
young great white sharks,

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.979
inducing TI for so long 
the immobilized sharks,

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:33.729
who must move to respire, 
essentially suffocate.

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.780
Humans can also flip sharks into TI.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.910
By stroking a shark’s 
electrically-sensitive snout

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.808
and gently turning it over,

00:03:40.808 --> 00:03:44.569
researchers can induce TI 
that lasts up to 15 minutes.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.299
That’s enough time to insert tags,

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.536
remove hooks,

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:49.789
and even perform surgeries.

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:51.241
There are risks however:

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:56.660
TI can hamper respiration and induce
hyperglycemia, a sign of stress.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.220
So this technique should only 
be used when necessary.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:06.539
Humans can also experience TI when they
freeze with fear during violent assaults.

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:10.568
Recognizing this ancient, involuntary
form of self-defense

00:04:10.568 --> 00:04:13.283
has significant implications 
when trying to understand

00:04:13.283 --> 00:04:17.898
why some victims don’t flee 
or fight in the face of danger.

00:04:17.898 --> 00:04:20.310
So, studying TI in non-human animals

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.119
not only helps us better understand some
odd behaviors,

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:26.756
it can also help us better 
understand our own,

00:04:26.756 --> 00:04:28.780
sometimes counterintuitive,

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.648
responses to violence.
