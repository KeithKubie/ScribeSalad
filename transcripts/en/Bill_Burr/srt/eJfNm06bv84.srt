1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:03,780
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:06,090
It's time for the Monday
morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,091 --> 00:00:10,260
January 1st,
2018 oh my God.

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:11,760
It's a new year.

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,500
A new with the new year comes hopes in
jeans for a better world and God wants us

6
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:24,780
to sit there and try to make
it a better world. Well,

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:29,040
you should probably start with yourself.
Friends

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,840
have seen those people late night trying
to tell you how to make it a better

9
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:34,674
world,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,473
you know,

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,080
or somebody writes a song about it,

12
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,660
make it a better place for you and for
me and the plumber down the street,

13
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,923
right?

14
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:52,450
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,690
It's very difficult. The older you get
to listen to those songs going like,

16
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,520
all right,
so,

17
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,230
okay.

18
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,410
Not only are you not going to
make the world a better place,

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,300
you're going to write some cheese ball
fucking song and make money off the fact

20
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,070
that people want to
make it a better place.

21
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:14,180
You're going to give some fucking
stupid pop culture psychology,

22
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,710
right? Pop Psychology. Is that
what you're going to throw out?

23
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,800
I don't know what the fuck it is.

24
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:23,990
It's like after nine 11 when that
country guy wrote that song, you know,

25
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,130
Uncle Sam's Buda, Buda, Buda, and you're
right. It's like, how did he like,

26
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,330
like that wasn't going to be a giant hit.
Yeah.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,953
You know,

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,720
I dunno what I'm talking about.

29
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,340
All I could tell you is I'm doing this
Monday morning podcast on Tuesday, uh,

30
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,190
because I was like, well,
what do I do? Do I do it?

31
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,170
Do I do it the night before
I go to the Rose Bowl?

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,010
And then by the time I tell you the
Rosebowl stories, it's like four days old,

33
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:55,860
or do I just go to the rose
bowl and do it a little late?

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,390
I decided on the ladder.
All right.

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,410
And I apologize to any, I
dunno, whatever fucking group,

36
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,990
you know what I'm hoping
in 20 2018 happens,

37
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,980
I just hope that people start
standing up to all of this fucking,

38
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,453
you know,

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:18,040
the amount of people being offended,
you know,

40
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:19,420
it's not that you get offended,

41
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:24,421
it's the level of coverage that it gets
compared to shit that really is way,

42
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:29,770
way, way more devastating
to realize. By the way,

43
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:33,240
you know what's really was bugging me,
you know,

44
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:35,430
and there was all those
hurricanes and everybody,

45
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,300
everybody sending fucking money
out and all alleged shit, right?

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,920
You gotta help all these people in
Houston guy to help all these people in

47
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,590
Florida. Hey, where
the fuck were you guys?

48
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:51,330
Wouldn't the Hollywood hills were on fire?
Ha, I didn't see any fucking benefits

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,750
for fucking, what's his name? Ralph
Nader. What's the fucking guys name?

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,110
Who Owns Fox?
Whatever the fuck his name is.

51
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,250
Will that poor bastards
mansion was catching on fire?

52
00:03:06,251 --> 00:03:10,030
Did any of you fucking people floating on
a mattress, a Houston a few months ago?

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,120
Rub a couple of nickels
together and send it to him.

54
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:18,510
Make some teary eyed videos.

55
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,560
I just kind of seems like
it's a one way street here.

56
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,550
The fuck is the guy's name alone is Fox.

57
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,390
Is it Ralph? It's one of those fucking
names where you see like, you know,

58
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,130
you know,

59
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,880
chicks didn't take him seriously in high
school and then all of a sudden he owns

60
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,480
like the biggest network ever.
And all those women there,

61
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,550
I should've fucked Ralph.

62
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,190
Why did I have to fuck to the quarterback?

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,680
Baker, mid fucking man's field,
whatever the fuck his name is.

64
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,060
The guy won the Heisman,
the hell's his name.

65
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:02,760
Baker Mayfield. Boom, boom, boom, boom.

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,220
[inaudible] sorry.
That was my bad.

67
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:08,530
Curtis may feel when I pull
a pass to that guy was, huh?

68
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,660
If I could sing and all these great songs,

69
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,290
he's doing a Goddamn cake and
the literally the lighting
falls down on them and

70
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:17,780
breaks his fucking neck. I mean, how,

71
00:04:17,781 --> 00:04:19,890
how did he continue to write music?

72
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,720
I don't know how the fuck is at some
people. I don't know. I hate to say this.

73
00:04:26,721 --> 00:04:30,740
I know this about myself at that
ever fucking happened to me.

74
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:34,160
I would just be yelling, kill me to
everybody who came walking into the room.

75
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,130
We're going to start your
rehab. Kill me, kill me.

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,220
Give me a fucking something.

77
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,340
I'm not strong enough to get through this.

78
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,190
Jesus. This is dark. Sorry. Whatever.

79
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:51,520
That's what happens when you just
fucking start running. You Yap.

80
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,820
All of a sudden this happens.
Okay.

81
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:57,560
So I'd like to apologize to all Curtis
Mayfield fence and anybody who stubbed

82
00:04:57,561 --> 00:04:57,891
their toe.

83
00:04:57,891 --> 00:05:02,891
Speaking of which I'm at the fucking
I co I cooked up a goddamn store this

84
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,760
weekend. I went out strong. All right.

85
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,450
So the great j law had Rosebowl tailgate
legend Jason Law had he fucking,

86
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:18,200
uh, he goes to put together the
menu, right? And he does, doesn't go,

87
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,680
we're doing burgers, we're doing dogs.
He just, he doesn't do that horse shit.

88
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:26,510
J fucking analyze like bill Belicheck.
He fucking looks okay.

89
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:31,580
Oklahoma is playing George's planes. The
next thing you know, he's like, well,

90
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,640
in Oklahoma, you know, they do
this tri tip something or other.

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,010
So he gets that going. I'd tell him, Hey,
you want me make a pie this year? Goes,

92
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:41,930
yeah, why don't you make
a Peach Pie for Georgia?

93
00:05:41,931 --> 00:05:46,040
And He ties this whole fucking Oklahoma
Georgia thing together was incredible.

94
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,140
So I'd never made a peach pie. Right.
And I know peaches or out of season.

95
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,090
So I'm like,

96
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,060
why am I going to go down there and buy
some fucking out of season piece to some

97
00:05:56,061 --> 00:06:01,061
poor fucking had to pick off of what
used to be his own property down in Costa

98
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:05,370
Rica, whatever the fuck they do.
However they do the the fruit nowadays.

99
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,240
Yeah,

100
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,570
I fucking, I say, I said, fuck it man.

101
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,850
I'll go down getting them canned peaches.

102
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,960
I'm going to get some goddamn canned
peaches. So I got some canned peaches.

103
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:19,903
Okay.

104
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:21,760
Pick the fucking recipe off the Internet.

105
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:25,510
And this is what I found with
recipes on the Internet. Okay?

106
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:28,810
They're going to get it to
you so it tastes really good,

107
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,913
but they're not going to,

108
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,860
they're not going to give you
the recipe or it tastes great.

109
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,830
So what they're gonna do is they're
going to, you don't remember that guy.

110
00:06:35,831 --> 00:06:40,060
I'm going to bring it up a notch. Bam.
And he'd be screaming and yelling.

111
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,480
He had that fucking band,

112
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,580
Emeril lagasse right about how
he used to take it up a notch.

113
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,700
Do what they do on the Internet
is every fucking recipe.

114
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,460
They take it down a notch,
take it down a notch,

115
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,810
and then they fucking remove something.
They take something out,

116
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:01,010
some little specials, special spice.
So anytime you make an a fucking pie,

117
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,910
here's it's a little sage advice for you.
All right? It's going to be the usual.

118
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,370
Okay?
If you're doing some sort of fruit there,

119
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,510
it's going to be basically
a quarter cup of sugar.

120
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,760
I mean quarter cup of flour
and like a cup of sugar.

121
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,890
And then there's going to be cinnamon,
Nutmeg, uh, possibly vanilla,

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,010
I dunno, some sort of bullshit
and they're going to see 80 teeth,

123
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,060
Mooney the and like a teaspoon of that.
Fuck that fucked up.

124
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:27,570
Okay.

125
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:29,930
All right. They say eighth
of a teaspoon taken. Nice.

126
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,440
Helping of it with the eighth of a
teaspoon. That's what I do at Bam.

127
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:35,480
Throw that shit. Now what
do you want? A teaspoon?

128
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:36,620
I'll give you a teaspoon and a quarter.

129
00:07:36,621 --> 00:07:41,150
Maybe a teaspoon and a half
if I'm feeling crazy. Right.

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,620
You just kind of bring the levels
up on everything and then you think,

131
00:07:45,621 --> 00:07:47,840
what else would they have on their,
you know, they probably, you know,

132
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,880
squeeze a little lime on the peaches,
you know,

133
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:53,240
before they fucking do all of this shit,
right?

134
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,950
Maybe a little vanilla in there. And then
you always got to throw like, you know,

135
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,700
a little bit of butter in there
to mix all of that shit together.

136
00:08:01,701 --> 00:08:05,630
Then you taste it. You throw a little more
sugar on top, you bring everything up.

137
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,480
That's what I did.
And uh,

138
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:12,920
I gotta tell you my gut rave reviews
on a peach pie. Who Knew, who knew?

139
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,240
You know, people, you know, if you don't
try to explore the limits of your talents,

140
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,750
you'll never truly find out
how great your life could be.

141
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,940
So I made a peach pie.

142
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I made a practice one with Nia and it
was a deal I didn't have a lot of times.

143
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:37,960
So I actually went to the
store and bought a store,

144
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:40,630
bought frozen pie on the bottom,
sec religious,

145
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,520
and then I made a homemade one for on top,
you know,

146
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:46,810
cut my work in half.

147
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:50,220
And then there was this all this weirdness
where the one on the bottom was kind

148
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,700
of done, but the one on top
was, so I took it out and, uh,

149
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,770
you Nia took one bite of it and just
goes [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

150
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,310
does that shit. And I knew she was
right, but I also got mad at her,

151
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:05,700
you know what I mean? Cause I'm
lazy. I didn't want to go back,

152
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:08,910
so I fucking egg wash the Goddamn
pie because I forgot to do that.

153
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,740
Sprinkled some sugar on it,
threw it back in.

154
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,840
Then it was better than
I made a decent pie.

155
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,860
But then I brought all the levels up
and the one that I did to the rose bowl

156
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:20,340
fucking crushed,
or maybe people would just be nice.

157
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,750
I don't know. Um, I also
made a quiche Lorraine.

158
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,350
I've always wanted to make a quiche.
I mean, who doesn't like eggs?

159
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,300
Who does it like Pie Emmy right there.
You've got both things going on.

160
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,320
This is breakfast and dessert
all at the same fucking time.

161
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,210
And uh,

162
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,840
I go to make this thing and of course
knee is all over me looking at this,

163
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,860
looking at that, look at it. This,
I fucking stick to Kesha in there.

164
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:53,850
All right.
Do the whole damn thing.

165
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,470
I fucking 45 minutes in. You know, I'd
give it a little poke with the tongs.

166
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,210
It still looks jelly as hell.

167
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:03,720
So I leave it in for another 10 minutes
and then it looks pretty much solid and

168
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:06,090
I'm getting nervous dot. I'm going
to burn it. So I take it out,

169
00:10:06,091 --> 00:10:10,710
I let it cool off a couple of hours later,
I cut into it. It looks a little runny,

170
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,990
but I'm too hungry so I don't give a shit.
So I'm eating it.

171
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:15,270
It's clearly needs to go back
into the oven for 10 minutes,

172
00:10:15,271 --> 00:10:19,380
but it's fucking delicious.
So I get to try this. I think
it needs to be, you know,

173
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:22,540
I think it needs to go back to
the oven maybe for 10 minutes.

174
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,400
And she just cuts in and she goes,
Ooh.

175
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,970
And then eats and goes
[inaudible] [inaudible] and
I just went, you know what?

176
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:32,730
Fuck you. And she's like, well, I'm just
being honest. I'm like, I know. Yeah,

177
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,910
I know. I just want it, but it still
tastes good, right? She goes, yeah,

178
00:10:35,911 --> 00:10:38,520
but it's running. His shit needs to
go back in the oven. I'm like, well,

179
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,260
he could have said it tasted good first.

180
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,570
And she stormed out of the room and then
I was like, I'll come on honey, come on.

181
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,470
I'm sorry.
Sorry,

182
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:51,050
I won't be like this in 2018

183
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,380
so I put it back in the oven for like
another 10 minutes. Actually, Nia did,

184
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,920
she finished the thing off and it,
it tasted fucking delicious.

185
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:05,170
And then before the fucking rose bowl,
um,

186
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,290
the night before, I'm thinking, all right,

187
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,860
[inaudible] is going to be making his
classic fucking a breakfast sandwich,

188
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,450
which is basically a English muffin.

189
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,470
He puts a little Havara,

190
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,910
ate cheese on one side and
then he has his avocado spread.

191
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:26,080
He does on the other side.

192
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:31,770
Then he cooks this fucking egg to absolute
perfection where it's not too runny.

193
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:38,410
It's not over hard. It's just
perfect. Not Quite over meeting, uh,

194
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,700
medium. It sounded like a medium
rare. So when you bite into it,

195
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,650
the egg yolk oozes out,

196
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,340
but it doesn't fall out of the
sandwich and all of that shit. Right.

197
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,240
And then also he,
he had marinated this,

198
00:11:52,241 --> 00:11:57,241
this tri tip that he put on top of
that and it was the best fucking eggs.

199
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,630
It was such a good egg sandwich.
I only had one cause he goes,

200
00:12:01,631 --> 00:12:04,330
you want to have another one? It's
like, no, I don't want to kill it.

201
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:07,500
You know what I mean?
Yeah.

202
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:11,350
And the night before I had made
these hash browns, you know,

203
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,760
the thing about it is, is you don't
want to make the fucking things,

204
00:12:13,761 --> 00:12:16,070
but you also don't want the
things to turn all brown and Shit.

205
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:21,071
So I actually did the whole mix and
then put it in a fucking Ziploc bag in

206
00:12:22,851 --> 00:12:24,230
squished all the air out of it.

207
00:12:24,231 --> 00:12:26,630
I possibly could stuck it in
the fridge and it was fine.

208
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,650
I cooked those fuckers up on the side.
At that point I was a little shit face.

209
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:32,210
I think I overdid it.
That's right.

210
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,730
I was already drunk before
breakfast even came out.

211
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,633
All right.

212
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,080
We had already loaded up the truck.
We put the game changer in there.

213
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:46,250
The game changer. Who by the way?
All right. The game changer is a,

214
00:12:46,251 --> 00:12:50,320
is a flat top griddle with four burners.
All right.

215
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,470
In the propane gas,
I'm telling you right.

216
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:57,790
That's what the fuck you want to
bring to a cookout. That thing,

217
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:02,350
it's just, you never have to worry about
your fire going out. There's not like,

218
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,840
there's not all of this pressure.
There's none of that shit.

219
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,430
You just turn that fucking thing on.
Jay's just like a short order cook.

220
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:12,880
I've never had the last two years I've
never seen him so relaxed at a cookout

221
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:16,300
because before you know,
we had a Hibachi that's way down here.

222
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:18,610
We had another one that was up
on its legs. This guy is going,

223
00:13:18,611 --> 00:13:22,930
he's doing like fucking 400 squats
an hour trying to cook everything,

224
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:27,490
making sure as fire doesn't
go out time and shit. And um,

225
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:31,190
and he cooks the whole time.
It's like he's cooking one thing.

226
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:33,560
He cooks a breakfast and he
cooked something in the middle,

227
00:13:33,561 --> 00:13:38,120
then he cooks the dinner. So he was
always having to add shit and calls.

228
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:42,200
And all that means is over the
course of like six hours. Um,

229
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,410
yeah.

230
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:47,280
So the flat top grill that j
law had dubbed the game changer.

231
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:52,800
Um, he was just crushing
it all day. And um,

232
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,630
I had gotten these things
cause this was our 10th, um,

233
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,370
Rosebowl in a row.

234
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,970
And anybody who's married knows that
your 10 year thing is 10 and not only do

235
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,520
they know that the, you know,
10 the 10 anniversary, you,

236
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,300
there's no way you can go out and buy
something made out of tin for your wife

237
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,860
only and she's going to be happy with
that unless you met an absolute sweetheart

238
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:21,430
who doesn't mind being broke or it
doesn't mind that she married a cheek.

239
00:14:21,431 --> 00:14:22,930
Fuck one of the other.
Anyways,

240
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,860
so I went out and I got these flasks
made up for me and Bartner cause we,

241
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,040
we were the original guys
who was just the two,

242
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:37,600
just the two of us the first year.
So I got a giant Roman numeral 10,

243
00:14:37,601 --> 00:14:42,250
like the Superbowl engraved on the front
and on the back I just had Joe Barton,

244
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,960
Nick Rosebowl tailgate legend.
And then I did like the American Express,

245
00:14:46,961 --> 00:14:51,550
the members sense and had oh nine and um,

246
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,360
next year law had gets his in a two years.
Feminists gets his,

247
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,960
although I have to correct you cause I
already had a made up and I thought that

248
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:04,520
they both came in 2010. Um, anyways,

249
00:15:04,521 --> 00:15:08,060
so I'm out there throwing
the football around.

250
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:11,450
I've got some booze in me,
right?

251
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:16,970
I smoked a little weed, which I never do,
but I'm just trying to lay off the bows.

252
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,760
And uh, this is why I don't
smoke weed is because you know,

253
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,410
with booze, if you reach for a
bottle of vodka, you know, okay.

254
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:32,240
You know basically what the
punch to the face is going to be.

255
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:36,080
Or if you grab a beer, you know what
that's going to be. You grabbed some wine,

256
00:15:36,081 --> 00:15:38,360
you know what that's going
to be when someone goes, hey,

257
00:15:38,361 --> 00:15:41,060
you want to take a hit of this choice?
You don't know what the fuck it is.

258
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:45,410
Is that the, is it that shit that just
kind of makes you feel like, hey man,

259
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:47,960
like everything's gonna be alright man.

260
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:52,040
Or is it going to have you just
fucking staring at a Goddamn tree?

261
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,663
Hmm.

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,340
So I, you know, I dunno what,
what are you supposed to do?

263
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:01,210
Just take one hit and then stand there
and wait for your face to start melting

264
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:06,100
and be like, oh, well it didn't. This
is why I'm done with fucking weed too.

265
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,770
So I take a fucking hit. I
don't feel anything. I'm like,
oh, this must be the, the,

266
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:15,030
the light one.
So then I go back and in about two,

267
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:19,440
three times and exceed, you know, I'm
telling everybody at the Tailgate, I go,

268
00:16:19,441 --> 00:16:23,160
hey man, listen. I know I'm really high
right now, but look at that fucking tree.

269
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,390
Isn't that fuck it.
That tree is fucking a mess.

270
00:16:26,391 --> 00:16:29,720
Like some shit out of a horror movie.
Look at that.

271
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:31,220
Look at the way it's like bent like that,

272
00:16:31,221 --> 00:16:36,221
and they're just laughing at me and I am
so at peace that I don't care that I'm

273
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:39,830
actually La. I don't give a fuck that
they're laughing at me. I'm just happy.

274
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:43,940
That point that I'm bringing them joy
is I make a complete fool of myself.

275
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,723
Um,

276
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,930
and I'm drinking from the flask
and then Jay throws a burger on.

277
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,180
We've got this grass fed fucking
grass fed fucking meet dude.

278
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,840
I fucking, it might've been
the best burger I ever had,

279
00:16:59,841 --> 00:17:04,130
but also I was so high, I was just
talking to people about this fucking tree,

280
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,190
which felt like an intense
minute. So, you know, it was like,

281
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:11,720
at least probably what,
like 11 minutes. Um,

282
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,720
I ate at Burger, it was
fucking amazing. And, uh,

283
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:21,320
then I went over to a chair. I sat down
and I passed out for like two hours.

284
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,713
It,

285
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:29,990
Jay was making these fucking
meatball subs on a Brioche Bun.

286
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,240
And I completely, I the last
like four or five years in a row,

287
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,260
I have missed the main course.
And by the way,

288
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,100
Americans call it an inmate, call it a
main course, don't call it the entree.

289
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:46,940
Alright?
In French entree means to enter it.

290
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:51,780
That's actually the beginning of the meal
in somewhere across the fucking ocean

291
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:56,580
in the scurvy and the fucking
slavery and the indentured servitude.

292
00:17:56,581 --> 00:18:00,930
However, whatever distracted
us, we fucked that up.

293
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,980
Entree means to enter.
That's the beginning. Okay.

294
00:18:04,981 --> 00:18:08,640
So just say the main course and for
the main core cell had this, uh,

295
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:12,900
what do you have for entrees?
Um,

296
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:18,180
so I missed that. I woke up and, uh,

297
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,980
I ended up, I tried the pie with
the Alamo. It was fucking delicious.

298
00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:23,910
Everybody loved it.

299
00:18:23,911 --> 00:18:28,140
And at that point I was kind of fucking
sober because I was actually way more

300
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:31,860
high than I was shit faced. And, um,

301
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:36,720
I didn't even smoke a
cigar and I went into the,

302
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:40,170
I went into the game
and, uh, I just started,

303
00:18:40,171 --> 00:18:42,720
anytime a vendor came by
just started crushing waters,

304
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:47,310
I was already on the wagon. That's how
fucked up I got at the tailgate. Like,

305
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,440
you know,
you know,

306
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:52,560
like when you're still legally drunk and
you're already back on the what you're

307
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:53,221
telling people,

308
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:56,730
I'm on the wagon as you have
like literally they could
let your breath on fire.

309
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:02,100
Um, that's, that's what,
you know, you went to hard.

310
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,090
I don't really have any fucking stories
about the tailgate cause I barely

311
00:19:06,091 --> 00:19:09,450
remember it. Um, other than
it was fucking awesome.

312
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,220
I do remember I was drinking, uh, uh,

313
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:19,150
millers. I was drinking out of
that flask. I had, you know,

314
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,780
once a year a mill.
I had Miller and Miller lite.

315
00:19:22,781 --> 00:19:26,800
Miller lite comes back with their old
school, less filling tastes. Great bottle.

316
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,830
So I add a couple of those.
Um,

317
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:38,130
I threw the football around lefty.
I vaguely remember that. Oh.

318
00:19:38,131 --> 00:19:42,090
And then somebody at the tailgate told
me a fucking story about how Garappolo

319
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:44,190
ended up on the fucking 40 niners.

320
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,190
Evidently the Cleveland browns
were interested in getting him,

321
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:55,380
but bill Belicheck still holds a grudge
against them for him, for his time,

322
00:19:57,510 --> 00:20:01,890
you know, 1995 when he was coaching at
which I believe he was also with fucking,

323
00:20:01,891 --> 00:20:04,590
what's his face?
Nick Saban there.

324
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:09,260
So he's like, fuck that. And
he calls up to 49 is, he goes,

325
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:11,630
give me a second round draft pick.
We'll give you a grappler.

326
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:15,590
How fucking nuts as a, I've wrote
a couple of those stories recently.

327
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:21,020
Like, do you know the Celtics got into
a position to g to get Bill Russell?

328
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,880
This is a story that was told to me.
Sit down,

329
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:28,820
gather around and listen to this tale.
Um,

330
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:34,530
the Celtics had too good of a year to
be in a position to draft Bill Russell.

331
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,480
So radar back makes a bunch of fucking
moves to get all the way up to number two.

332
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:45,390
Alright. But the problem is
is the Rochester royals is
some shit head number one.

333
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,200
There was nothing he could do
to get them to not, you know,

334
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:53,200
to give up the number one pick and
everybody was going to take Bill Russell.

335
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:54,700
He was just clearly the best guy.

336
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,220
So the Boston got it,

337
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:04,950
had the fucking ice capades every year
and they used to make a bunch of money

338
00:21:04,961 --> 00:21:05,650
off that.
Now you,

339
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,030
I know a lot of you fucking millennials
out there like the ice capades bunch of

340
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,410
people twirling around,
dress on the ice, right?

341
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,770
Skating around dress like
fucking Yogi and booboo bear.

342
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,460
Why the fuck would I go see that bullshit?
Well, it was before the Internet,

343
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,560
the one you had a little black and
white fucking TV, you know what I mean?

344
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,480
The picture was always jumping.
This was just some exciting shit.

345
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,200
There wasn't a teddy bar or fucking free
internet porn. Every once in awhile,

346
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:34,750
you know, once a year, these beautiful
fucking goddess women would come in,

347
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,870
what their shapely thighs and he could
sit there and look at them and pretend

348
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:44,080
you were into the yard and just sat right
next to your wife. You could fuck it.

349
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:48,160
You know, look at some
games over there, right?

350
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,010
So would,
it would always sell out.

351
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:55,420
So the Rochester royals
were hurting for money.

352
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:59,530
So red our back called up the
ice capade guy. He goes, Hey,

353
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:01,120
can you do me a fucking solid?

354
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:06,670
Can you fucking get the ice capades can
you guarantee that you'll do a couple of

355
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:09,760
dates out there for these fucking
guys? He said, absolutely I will.

356
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,340
So he called them up as it, listen, I'll
get you to give me the number one pick.

357
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,530
I gave you the fucking
ice capades for a week.

358
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,500
You make all this goddamn money in
the miser that owned the team said,

359
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:21,520
you know what, I'll take
that deal. I will say,

360
00:22:21,521 --> 00:22:22,930
forget Bill Russell.

361
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:26,710
So Dorothy Hamill can
come in or Peggy Fleming,

362
00:22:26,711 --> 00:22:31,700
whoever the fuck it was back there.
I Dunno way back then.

363
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:34,580
It was probably some woman named Ethel
and she was considered hot, right?

364
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,830
Bethel McGuire in Hazel said,
Gorski or come and skate. Oh my God,

365
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,630
she's so fucking hot. Right. Years
later they wrote on the golden girls,

366
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,820
but back then they were
a hot piece of ass.

367
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,700
Now I know I skipped over
a lot of fucking details,

368
00:22:52,701 --> 00:22:55,430
so you should probably listen to
the Bill Simmons podcast, right?

369
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:59,000
To figure out what really happened.
But that's what was told to me.

370
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,100
And you know what,
God damn and I'm sticking with it.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,390
I'm fucking sticking with that story.
So anyways, all Billie, no fun.

372
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,580
I'm not going a bunch of days
again, but like, I'm just like, uh,

373
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,270
I'm done.
All right.

374
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I came off the wagon on December 26th
and now it's January 2nd and I'm right

375
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:21,170
back on. I had, I had a hell of a week.

376
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,980
One day I didn't drink. All
right. That was the 28th.

377
00:23:27,981 --> 00:23:32,750
December 20th. So six out of
the last seven days I drank. Uh,

378
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:35,030
I don't like how I feel.
I don't like how I look.

379
00:23:35,031 --> 00:23:38,450
I just can't fucking do it anymore.
Okay. I'm turning 50 in June.

380
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,080
I had a great half of a century run.
All right.

381
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,940
I never really drank until I was like 17.

382
00:23:43,941 --> 00:23:48,020
So what am I had a good 30 year
Larry Bird. Speaking of the guard,

383
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:50,030
I had a nice 33 year run.

384
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,823
Okay.

385
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,930
So, uh, I am now going to be
that guy that picks a spot.

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,460
Am I going to be that fucking dude?

387
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,410
Maybe I'd just be that guy that has a
glass of wine with dinner every once in

388
00:24:03,411 --> 00:24:04,244
awhile.

389
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,243
You know,

390
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,071
it's just like,

391
00:24:09,071 --> 00:24:13,300
just all this awkward silence between me
and my wife as we sit on either end of

392
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:16,180
this really long dinner table,
you know,

393
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,770
and all you hear is just me like turning
the pages of the paper and you know,

394
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,490
shaking it, you know, you can do that
thing to make sure it straightens out

395
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,320
every once in a while
just being like, oh, new.

396
00:24:28,321 --> 00:24:32,380
Did you see down in Brazil in a really?

397
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,450
Um, I don't know what
I'm going to do, but uh,

398
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,690
I'm, I'm just, I'm,

399
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,450
I'm bringing the way I was bringing
everything up in that recipe.

400
00:24:43,451 --> 00:24:45,790
I'm bringing everything down,
bringing everything down.

401
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,613
All right.

402
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:52,740
I'm fucking, uh, back to crushing
the waters on back on my diet.

403
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:56,490
And I got a couple of goals this year.
All right.

404
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,260
On the biggest mistakes I made in my
adult life was buying 34 inch jeans after

405
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,550
being a 32. All right, 32
best shape of my fucking life.

406
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,620
They started getting a little tight around
the fucking waste and I thought, oh,

407
00:25:12,621 --> 00:25:15,840
you know, you get older, you fill out,
and it's like, no bill, you put on weight,

408
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:20,760
you can't, why don't you just take
fucking seven to 10 days to lose?

409
00:25:20,761 --> 00:25:24,180
I didn't, I bought the
next size up jeans. Okay.

410
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:28,830
And that was stupid because that just
gave me this leeway to be a fat fuck.

411
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:31,770
Who feels comfortable in his pants?

412
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:37,660
You never buy the next size up jeans after
you're done growing and all that shit,

413
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,860
you know what I mean? Unless you're a
fucking bean pole, which may be, I was,

414
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:45,460
so I'm back down to 33.
I figure I'll stay there.

415
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,110
So that's what I'm going to do. I got
my fucking wardrobe right now. I got it.

416
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,630
It's just like, you know,
I hate going shopping.

417
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:56,923
All right.

418
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:02,140
And I have not bought a fucking
shirt or a pair of pants

419
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,830
in a couple of years.

420
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,970
Kind of fucking couple of free tee shirts.

421
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:13,710
I bought a Primus tee shirt at the
concert I went to. But other than that,

422
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,080
it is just, I just, you know,

423
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,990
and I got rid of a bunch of old clothes.
So I have like,

424
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,140
I have two shirts that I wear,

425
00:26:24,141 --> 00:26:28,040
one of two shirts when I fucking had life.

426
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:32,480
Those are my two headlining shirts and
I think I have a pullover sweater and

427
00:26:32,481 --> 00:26:33,314
that's it.

428
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,320
And uh,

429
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,540
I don't think I give a shit.

430
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,243
You know,

431
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,530
I got to go out there,
have some

432
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:47,010
fucking rhinestone shiny goddamn shirt.

433
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,750
I really believe that as long as I have
a fucking act that nobody's going to

434
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,730
read really paying attention to the shirt.
Right. Well now that I brought it up,

435
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,540
you're gonna.
MMM.

436
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,700
I Dunno. Maybe I'll buy Shannon, maybe
I'll buy a fucking sweat. You know,

437
00:27:05,701 --> 00:27:08,610
I'm thinking, I'm thinking would be
that guy that just dresses all in black.

438
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:12,210
If I wasn't so fucking pasty
and I wouldn't look like
a floating head in hands,

439
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:15,100
I would do that.
But what's great about a black shirt,

440
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,080
you can wear that like three days in a
row before anybody really even notices

441
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,680
like this motherfucker's not
changing his shirt. You know,

442
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,470
that is the genius of
Malcolm young rest his soul,

443
00:27:25,471 --> 00:27:30,180
the greatest rhythm guitarist and
rock and roll history, in my opinion.

444
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,213
MMM.

445
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,970
The genius of the way
that that meant dressed.

446
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,990
The sheer amount of money that that
man saved by just wearing jeans and a

447
00:27:44,331 --> 00:27:47,060
fucking tee shirt,
right?

448
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,670
Einstein that said Einstein Shit.

449
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:52,670
That's what genius is.

450
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:56,930
Do they get rid of all the white noise
and they just focus on what's fucking

451
00:27:56,931 --> 00:28:00,570
important.
I was what he did.

452
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,780
He just was just a Allie
needs pants and a shirt.

453
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,330
I'm not going to be fucking sitting
there trying to be in style.

454
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:11,630
I'm going to dress timeless blue jeans
and a fucking black tee shirt and I'm

455
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:17,360
done. Do you ever see the
left? There'd be rocked video.

456
00:28:17,361 --> 00:28:21,150
That's one of my favorite parts of the
video when he's getting ready for the

457
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:25,280
show and he takes the t shirt off
and then he snaps his fingers,

458
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:28,310
like he says spoiled Rockstar and
they just throw him another tee shirt,

459
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:33,140
the exact same color he puts it on or a
slightly different color and then that's

460
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:33,974
it.
It's over.

461
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,143
MMM.

462
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:40,680
Anyways, my shoulder's been
doing great and then I fucked
it up at the, at the, uh,

463
00:28:40,681 --> 00:28:44,810
the tailgate. By the way, I was throwing
lefthanded doing our right, you know,

464
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:48,780
making sure I was given my right
shoulder arrest and everything.

465
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:52,950
I hadn't felt any pain in my
shoulder for days. Long story short,

466
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,260
at the end of the end of the,
uh, the tailgate, we're going to

467
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,160
close up the table and uh,

468
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:05,940
I'm on one side of the other guys on
the other side and we're folding up the

469
00:29:05,941 --> 00:29:09,330
legs and the one was getting
stubborn and where I had my fingers,

470
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:13,470
it fucking slammed down on
both of my fingers, right?

471
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:17,860
Just wham. And I went, ah,
fuck. And I pulled my arms out.

472
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,570
I was basically reaching around
the fucking table, you know,

473
00:29:21,571 --> 00:29:26,070
like I was given the skinniest person
ever the finish who at that finishing move

474
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:29,700
in wrestling where they just put you in
a fucking bear hug and they would act

475
00:29:29,701 --> 00:29:33,890
like he was being crushed to death.
I was doing that with the tables.

476
00:29:33,891 --> 00:29:36,870
So when I went to Yank my arms
I really quickly, it was like,

477
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,250
it was like I was throwing two elbows
at the same time and I felt like fucking

478
00:29:42,251 --> 00:29:47,230
lightning in my right shoulder.
And uh,

479
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,450
I think I went right back to square one.
I don't know what the fuck I got.

480
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,070
Do I think I'm going to do that Coby shit.
Um,

481
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:58,810
Robin told me about that whole stem
cells shit and I just get scared of that

482
00:29:58,811 --> 00:29:59,200
stuff.

483
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,200
I Dunno the way Joe Rogan is fearless
and we'll read up on something and then

484
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:08,770
make an informed decision before
he takes a step in that direction.

485
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,930
I just hear about something new,

486
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,800
do not read up on it and act like an
old lady who thinks the fucking sky's

487
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,730
falling. That's the way I approach
life. So I haven't done that yet.

488
00:30:18,731 --> 00:30:21,220
My shoulders still fucked up.
Um,

489
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,900
I might do that thing
where they take your own.

490
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,840
What I like about that fucking spinning a,

491
00:30:25,841 --> 00:30:29,920
your blood is it your own blood and
then they shoot it back in. Right.

492
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,920
Although I would want to watch
them the whole time, you know,

493
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:38,190
follow them around with my own blood
to make sure they don't take like the

494
00:30:38,191 --> 00:30:41,340
fucking blood of a yak or a fucking
chimp or some shit, whatever they,

495
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,820
whatever the fuck did with whatever
they're doing these days. Um,

496
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,150
to try to get that thing fixed.
Um, all right, let me, uh,

497
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:52,200
let me read to what do
I have any advertising?

498
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:59,500
Um, I don't know that I do during
the holidays. It's slows down.

499
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,270
I don't have any advertising.

500
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:03,330
Yeah.

501
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,010
Well what do you know?

502
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:12,010
What do Ya know? All right, let me see
here. I guess I don't have any advertise.

503
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,380
Well fuck it. Let's
continue talking. Alright,

504
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,670
this is what else I did on my wonderful,
over my wonderful holiday break.

505
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,420
I went down to the comedy store,

506
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:27,910
did it set, had a great time,
and I was driving home, you know,

507
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:33,120
and I'm driving along sunset just starting
to fucking listen to my tunes and all

508
00:31:33,521 --> 00:31:38,140
of a sudden they go by this venue
and I look and what do I see?

509
00:31:38,141 --> 00:31:43,141
I see Dave Chappelle and
John Mayer are doing a show.

510
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:45,610
I'm, I get the fuck Outta here. Right.

511
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:50,820
So I call up a buddy of mine that books
all the shows and I said, hey, what's,

512
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:55,100
what's the story with this?
This John Mayer, you know,

513
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:56,540
come out with his band.

514
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:57,600
Yeah.

515
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,840
You know this Dave, go on first is John go
on first, Blah Blah Blah. And he's like,

516
00:32:00,841 --> 00:32:05,610
no. What happens is John comes out, plays
like four songs. He brings Dave out.

517
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,380
Dave does stand up.

518
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:08,730
Yeah.

519
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,080
For an hour,
an hour and a half.

520
00:32:10,081 --> 00:32:13,770
And then he brings John back out
and then they just sort of riff

521
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,830
is Dave talks about shit. John will play
the music underneath. And I was like,

522
00:32:18,831 --> 00:32:22,460
I got to fucking see that. So, uh,

523
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,320
me and my me and the lovely Nia,

524
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,700
we went down there cause I never take a
route on New Year's Eve because that is

525
00:32:28,701 --> 00:32:33,230
the original Saint Patrick's Day. Um,
plus I go to the rose bowl the next day,

526
00:32:33,231 --> 00:32:36,340
so I need to get my sleep before I get
absolutely hammered and pass out in the

527
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:41,120
fucking chair for a couple of
hours. Missing meatball sub. Um,

528
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:43,340
so we went down there and um,

529
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:50,300
just had such a great fucking night. And
um, I don't think I've ever seen that.

530
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,730
I don't think I've ever seen
two people that fucking talented

531
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:57,980
like did usually one genius and then
surrounded by a bunch of people who would

532
00:32:57,981 --> 00:32:59,790
just sit in there.
Isn't he amazing?

533
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,200
I'm so happy to be barely playing bass
with this genius or I'm so happy to be

534
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:07,140
fucking, I dunno, whatever the fuck else.

535
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,400
I'm so happy to be in the ice capades
with this twirling genius. Right.

536
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,630
It was two of them.

537
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,500
And when I kind of noticed about
both of them is that they just,

538
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:19,080
it like most genius minds sake take cut.

539
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,180
They get rid of all the
fucking white noise.

540
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:25,410
Everything about every bit that
Chappelle did was just like,

541
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,850
there was no fat on it.
And he got right to the fucking point.

542
00:33:29,851 --> 00:33:32,970
Another thing that I loved was,
um,

543
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:33,930
yeah,

544
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,930
I can't believe that I've been in this
business long enough that we're like the

545
00:33:39,931 --> 00:33:40,980
older guys now.

546
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:47,050
It always blows my mind that I'm like
five years older than Dave Chappelle cause

547
00:33:47,051 --> 00:33:49,030
he was already a made guy when I came in.

548
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:53,890
So I always look at him like he's
got 10 years on me, you know,

549
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,260
or 15. And you know, just when
I watch his act, I'm like,

550
00:33:56,261 --> 00:34:00,520
this guy's clearly been doing this a
good couple of decades longer than me and

551
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:03,490
the realities, I think he's
only been doing it like six
years longer than I have.

552
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:05,590
It's something like that.
He's fucking amazing.

553
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:09,490
And what I love too is

554
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:12,503
just,

555
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:13,240
yeah,

556
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,200
he's that same. Um,
with all that's changed,

557
00:34:18,201 --> 00:34:21,380
everybody getting offended, all of this
fucking crap. I, you get in trouble.

558
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,940
He hasn't changed at all.

559
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,000
He's just like that same guy that I saw
way back in the day when I used to go to

560
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:34,001
the Boston comedy club and watched them
go on at like two in the morning and

561
00:34:34,521 --> 00:34:37,430
just start murdering at
two in the fucking morning.

562
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,040
And I remember I used to always sit
there going, how the fuck do you do that?

563
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:44,270
How do you get that funny at two in the
morning in front of a crowd that gave up

564
00:34:44,271 --> 00:34:47,960
on the show like an hour ago and they're
tired and they just want to go home

565
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,570
that second he steps on
stage. Boom. He just like,

566
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,390
he just starts fucking killing. So, um,

567
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:01,640
you know, days update, murdering me in
the eye, like just fucking laughing,

568
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,490
die and having a great time and I'm,

569
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,550
and then he brings John Mayer back on.

570
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,680
I don't want to ruin the show for him
because I don't know how many they going

571
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:11,660
to do. But, uh,

572
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,210
basically if Dave was up there and
he would just say in like, you know,

573
00:35:17,211 --> 00:35:21,290
I was watching fucking
Hawaii five o like John,

574
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,740
whenever you've chief fucking rifts,
it's clearly that David's just ripping,

575
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:28,280
like mayor could play whatever the fuck
he said. And Dave said that at one point,

576
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:29,930
he goes, I don't know if
you guys realize this shit,

577
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,230
but John Mayer can play whatever he hears.

578
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,410
And then he just started
doing all this crazy shit,

579
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,420
like make his guitar sound
like a cat or a car beeping.

580
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,590
Like it went beyond.
I can play songs,

581
00:35:43,591 --> 00:35:45,540
like he can just do
noises around the house,

582
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,370
but it was fucking,
that was fucking incredible.

583
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:58,020
Um, so if you get a chance, I don't know
if you get a chance to go see the show,

584
00:35:58,021 --> 00:36:02,940
definitely. Uh, definitely go do it.
Um, all right. And what that, let me,

585
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:07,360
uh, speaking of which,
let me promote this, um,

586
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,180
uh,

587
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,960
the Patrice O'Neal comedy benefit and I
forgot to fucking ask Dave Chappelle if

588
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:15,750
he ever wanted to come in and do it.
God dammit.

589
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:22,770
Um, anyways. All right. Patrice
O'Neal benefit is on February 20th,

590
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,920
uh, 2018. Uh,

591
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:30,120
it makes a great gift for Christmas.
This is old copy.

592
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:36,450
Uh, whatever. It's a
great fucking benefit. Uh,

593
00:36:36,451 --> 00:36:39,450
we have all these amazing
comedians on it and, um,

594
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:44,510
what a great way to start the year by
seeing an all star lineup of old comedians

595
00:36:45,241 --> 00:36:48,930
like myself, all the way down to new
convenience that were influenced by

596
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:53,420
Patrice O'Neal. By the way, I'm going to
post this video once a year. I got a post.

597
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,120
It, um, is that one when,

598
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,670
when Patrice was watching
the up and down game,

599
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,140
just his laugh and all of that shit.
I just got up once a year. I, I,

600
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:09,120
I kind of watched that
video once a year and um,

601
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,040
it's Kinda been nice over the years where
it became less sad for me to watch it

602
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:17,130
and now it just, uh, I don't, I get it.

603
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,190
I just guess I got to
the point in my grief,

604
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:25,170
which I'll never be over him not
being around, but I guess, um,

605
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,840
I've gotten to the point with my grief
where I just, I just think like, um,

606
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:35,680
I like what an amazing
person to have known. Um,

607
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,590
ah, see it's still said it's always
going to be sad, but can you dope.

608
00:37:41,310 --> 00:37:43,620
It's going to be fucking
set. So I'll, I'll post that.

609
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,100
But those of you new to the podcast,
you know, as the years go by,

610
00:37:47,101 --> 00:37:51,080
maybe even new to Patrice, which
blows my mind, but, uh, uh,

611
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,240
I'll post that video and then
you can go down a wonderful,

612
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:58,470
hilarious rabbit hole of anything that
fucking guy ever said. So anyways,

613
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:01,890
we're doing a benefit for his loved ones
that he was taken care of when he was,

614
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,640
uh,
still alive and a,

615
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:08,200
all the money after we get done paying
for the fucking venue, being upfront,

616
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,060
being transparent, uh, we'll go
to his loved ones. All right.

617
00:38:12,061 --> 00:38:14,100
It's on February 20th in New York City.

618
00:38:14,101 --> 00:38:16,410
What a Greg excuse to go to New York City.

619
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:20,460
Go skating down Rockefella center.
Watch a bunch of great comedians.

620
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,300
Honor the greatest comic that I ever saw.
A Patrice O'Neil.

621
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:29,130
February 20th, 2018 at the New York
City Center. All right, there we go. Um,

622
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:34,620
moving on. Uh, did anybody
watch the Celtics first?

623
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,980
The Houston Rockets? Holy Shit. Goddamn.

624
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,950
What a fucking game that was.
James Harden, by the way,
is, is fun to fucking watch.

625
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,690
You know I love about that guy.
He looks,

626
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,040
he doesn't look like a basketball player.
I look at dead guy and I go,

627
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:54,980
that guy knows how to play the trumpet.
Something about does it,

628
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,970
he looks like one of those fucking like
his last name should be Hargrove is some

629
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:02,890
shit. And this, I dunno, somebody
shorts his beard and his haircut.

630
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:03,963
It's very,

631
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:08,590
he looks Aba ish even though I
guess he should have a giant Afro.

632
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:12,720
I don't know what, but I taped
the game. I heard how amazing was.

633
00:39:12,721 --> 00:39:17,500
So I already knew the result and I
watched the game and of course my fucking,

634
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:19,510
my uh,

635
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:25,350
my recording cut off right at the end
of the game before Al Horford hit the

636
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:30,430
shot. And, and uh, hard and kind of
had a meltdown I guess through style.

637
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,830
Marcus smart to the floor or some shit.

638
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,690
I don't know what happened
but I guess he got pissed.

639
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,160
He went to little Grankowski
against the bills. Um,

640
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:43,390
by the way,
congratulations to the buffalo bills.

641
00:39:43,391 --> 00:39:46,810
I was actually really
pulling for you guys, um,

642
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:51,310
even though you were in our
division or whatever. Um,

643
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,510
I just feel like the football
gods had punished you guys enough.

644
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:01,600
It was great to see you guys back.
Get back in with tie rod. Tayla um,

645
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,280
so congratulations on that.

646
00:40:03,281 --> 00:40:07,000
And then also can you believe the
fucking NFL season is already over?

647
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,500
How does that happen?

648
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:12,670
I'll tell you what else
I don't understand.

649
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,930
How it happens is I go to see that
unbelievable rose bowl game I just fucking

650
00:40:15,931 --> 00:40:20,280
saw and I didn't even talk about the game.
All right,

651
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,600
here's my breakdown or the game.
Fucking

652
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:27,900
fucking, here we go. You know,

653
00:40:27,901 --> 00:40:29,760
this is going to be an
intelligence breakdown in the game.

654
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:33,210
Oklahoma's going no huddled
the whole fucking first half.

655
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,450
Georgia's Goddamn head is spinning around.

656
00:40:36,451 --> 00:40:40,500
They don't know what to
do right before they have,

657
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,420
they kicked an onside kick, which I
get this six second slap you thinking,

658
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,620
all right, I don't want this
guy to run this ball back.

659
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,090
We'll kick it to an up person.
They'll, we'll fucking tackle
them, Yada, Yada, Yada,

660
00:40:51,091 --> 00:40:51,871
and that'll be over.

661
00:40:51,871 --> 00:40:54,930
Who the fuck knew Georgia was going to
come out through a quick fucking pass,

662
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,100
get in field goal range and instead
of being down by three scores,

663
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,270
17 points.

664
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,880
They're only down by two scores were
like dumb fucking move and George is

665
00:41:03,881 --> 00:41:08,730
getting the Goddamn ball.
All right. No, no, I'm sorry.

666
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:13,490
Oklahoma got the ball. They kicked
off to them. That was the thing.

667
00:41:13,491 --> 00:41:17,870
They were up by 17 fucking points and
they would get the ball after the half.

668
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:23,450
I mean they had their foot on their
fucking neck. I get the onside thing.

669
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,530
I don't fault him for that, but in the
third quarter when they stopped going,

670
00:41:27,531 --> 00:41:28,364
no huddle,

671
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:32,990
they started playing Marty ball and
they're trying to bleed out the fucking,

672
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:39,070
I actually get that fucking move.
But then Georgia scores a touchdown.

673
00:41:39,071 --> 00:41:43,540
Now they've scored 10 on answered.
You're still trying to bleed the clock.

674
00:41:43,541 --> 00:41:46,690
They score another touchdown.
Now they've gone 17 on answered.

675
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:51,820
You still in your huddle,
they score 24 fucking unanswered points

676
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:58,650
to go up by seven before you finally
decide out of the fucking blue to go back

677
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:02,470
to no huddle.
And the second they go back to no huddle,

678
00:42:02,471 --> 00:42:06,340
Georgia has a problem again. Bam.
They score a fucking touchdown.

679
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:10,720
I'm running out of sound effects
cause Allie, they fumble the ball.

680
00:42:10,950 --> 00:42:13,240
Your return it.
Now you're up by fucking seven.

681
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,750
You've got to give it to Georgia bulldogs.

682
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,090
They have Georgia Goddamn fucking
bulldogs. Hey, they came back, tied it up,

683
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:25,030
and for the first time ever in a hundred,

684
00:42:25,031 --> 00:42:29,950
and I don't know how many goddamn years
are the fucking Rosebowl. All right.

685
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:33,790
They had an overtime game and
it doesn't just go to one.

686
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:37,940
Over time it goes to
two, two overtimes. Um,

687
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,220
congratulations to the Georgia bulldogs,
um,

688
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,130
on an amazing victory. Uh, I don't
know why I was, I was actually,

689
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,170
even though I'm a big SCC guy,
I was kind of torn.

690
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,510
I was a little emotionally torn.

691
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:55,810
I was rooting for Oklahoma
for whatever fucking reason.

692
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,550
I just decided I was
going to root for them.

693
00:42:57,551 --> 00:43:00,790
I don't have anything
against Georgia, but, um,

694
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,690
I was,
uh,

695
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:09,110
I was actually also on another level kind
of sight to see Georgia wind because j

696
00:43:11,491 --> 00:43:12,091
law had,

697
00:43:12,091 --> 00:43:17,091
is so fucking pissed that
Ohio state didn't get in and
he thinks CSCC is totally

698
00:43:18,301 --> 00:43:19,470
fucking overrated.

699
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:21,983
MMM.

700
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,311
And you know,

701
00:43:23,311 --> 00:43:27,480
he was arguing for the PAC 12 he was
at one point he was fucking arguing.

702
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:30,990
I was like, Jesus Christ
Jay, it's eight o'clock,

703
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:33,480
you're already fucking wine and a
by the buck guides. And he said,

704
00:43:33,481 --> 00:43:36,900
the most innocent voice every pointed at
somebody else at the tailgate. He goes,

705
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,730
he brought it up, he put it, he went
from like going and where we fucking,

706
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,540
we beat Penn state and they'll
say, he's goes, he brought it up.

707
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:53,050
So I thought it was kind of funny,
you know, and then Alabama also once,

708
00:43:53,051 --> 00:43:54,930
so both SCC teams,

709
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,050
SCC teams that got in are now
going to play for the championship.

710
00:43:58,051 --> 00:44:00,270
So the SEC is going to
win another fucking title.

711
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:04,590
And it just cracks me up that that's
going to bump j law head and he just will

712
00:44:04,591 --> 00:44:09,180
not admit that on the Ohio state buckeyes
had no fucking business last year of

713
00:44:09,181 --> 00:44:12,840
being one of the final four,
considering they lost to Penn state.

714
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,850
And then Penn state won
the title. He goes, Bill,

715
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:18,270
you're not listening to what I'm saying.
I'm saying that Penn State got screwed.

716
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,160
But that's all he'll say.

717
00:44:20,161 --> 00:44:25,161
He will not say that Ohio state did not
deserve to be in their last year despite

718
00:44:25,321 --> 00:44:29,430
the fact that they then went there and
lost 24, seven and he's all, I'll fucking,

719
00:44:29,431 --> 00:44:33,930
Deshaun Watson was unbelievable. It's
like, dude, he wasn't tackling guys too.

720
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:35,910
You scored no points.

721
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:40,350
So I feel like Ohio state
this year got punished.

722
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,710
Um, for the fucking snooze fest. They
basically ate their balls last year.

723
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:50,190
A wanted to get another Saturday night,
eight o'clock spot at the club.

724
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,820
They're like, no buddy, you're
going to get a Wednesday. Um,

725
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:58,170
and I actually think that Ohio state
would have done great, you know,

726
00:44:58,171 --> 00:44:59,880
considering when I watched their game,

727
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,460
how their front for are all first and
second round draft picks on the defensive

728
00:45:05,461 --> 00:45:09,090
side. Um, I actually agree with j law had,

729
00:45:09,091 --> 00:45:11,100
but like you don't get
your cake and eat it.

730
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:16,101
You don't get to suck and get in and lose
by 24 points and don't even score one

731
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:18,270
fucking point the year before.

732
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:21,330
And then the next year when you're
actually good enough to get an also get

733
00:45:21,331 --> 00:45:25,980
rewarded, you know? So that's my
beef, that's my beef with j law here,

734
00:45:25,981 --> 00:45:30,330
but I still love the Getty death,
so we'll get over it. Um, anyways,

735
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,270
amazing fucking game. And um, we,

736
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:37,790
we went the whole game without having
an incident until the very end.

737
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,730
I Dunno what happened.
Bart. Nick was, you know,

738
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,030
a little boost up and I think he bumped
into somebody in front of us in this

739
00:45:44,031 --> 00:45:47,140
fucking guy who I swear
to God was as old as me.

740
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:49,010
It starts yelling at
Barton Creek and Barton.

741
00:45:49,011 --> 00:45:53,590
Nick is just staring at him and I'm
just staring at him and he's like,

742
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,440
I'll be a nice stop bumping you.

743
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:59,530
We just fucking stare at him and
I'm looking at this guy like, dude,

744
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:03,910
you're as old as me and you're yelling
at the human version of a fucking Kodiak

745
00:46:03,911 --> 00:46:04,744
bear.

746
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:09,730
And the guy didn't know what she was
waiting for us to respond and we didn't

747
00:46:09,731 --> 00:46:11,290
respond,
but it was just lie had,

748
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:14,890
we were all just staring at the guy and
they just looked at Joe and he goes,

749
00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:20,300
fuck you. They fucking turns
around. It's like, dude,

750
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:24,790
between all of us were
about 225 years old.

751
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:30,360
This is the first Rosebowl ever that
is going into fucking over time.

752
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:34,520
You want, you want to get kicked out, uh,

753
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:39,220
you want to roll around in these
stadium floors with you fucking,

754
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,670
this guy wasn't even
wearing true religion jeans,

755
00:46:42,671 --> 00:46:46,480
which puppet for Come Dad James in
the last fucking 12 years. He's, he,

756
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,400
I think he was, he was
probably wearing the, you know,

757
00:46:48,401 --> 00:46:52,540
the Lee jeans and on the tag it just
said in giant bold letters, Lee,

758
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,220
you know, which where I came from
basically meant that, you know,

759
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:02,650
your family was barely,
could barely afford to live in,

760
00:47:02,651 --> 00:47:06,940
in a blue collar town. Um,
if he had the lead genes,

761
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,890
the lead genes in the gap jeans,

762
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,273
you know.

763
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:15,550
Yeah. They have Levi. Yeah. I believe
that's how simple life was back then.

764
00:47:15,551 --> 00:47:19,240
If you had Levi, that meant that your
parents were actually doing well.

765
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,950
Okay. And it before, uh, diesel
jeans came in and fucked it.

766
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:26,800
Just fucked it all up.

767
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,473
You know,

768
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,260
jeans were like 25,

769
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:36,060
30 bucks and I know with inflation will
just say jeans for like 50 bucks. Right?

770
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:41,300
Then all of a sudden diesel comes along
and then like twice that and the next

771
00:47:41,731 --> 00:47:44,700
thing you know,
that's like $200 pairs of jeans

772
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,910
that suffocate your balls and still
can't get up and over your flat ass.

773
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,490
I don't fucking understand what,
I don't understand genes.

774
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:56,670
And then that tapered in down the bottom.

775
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:00,570
Like you're going to do ballet and
people need to see your feet, right?

776
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,740
Like you're going to
reenact the thriller video.

777
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,950
Um, I dunno. Anyways,

778
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:10,900
let's read some of the fucking,

779
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:16,120
the letters here over the a that I got.

780
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,140
If I can find them. Oh, I guess I
didn't copy and paste them. Did I?

781
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,010
Where are they? All right, here we go.

782
00:48:24,430 --> 00:48:26,650
This is a very dramatic email.

783
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:31,210
It says it's the name of
this email is good. Bye,

784
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,100
dear bill.
I am sadly no longer a fan.

785
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:41,470
It's really too bad because I was a huge
fit. All right. What do you think I did?

786
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:45,650
What did I say? Who
did I say it about? Uh,

787
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:50,650
went to see you and Paul Versey in Albany,
New York. Oh, that was a great show.

788
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,760
And I've watched every one of your
specials as well as F is for family.

789
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,320
And I'm an avid podcast listener.
All right. So what he's doing now,

790
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:04,420
he or she is doing is establishing that
they listened to every fucking thing

791
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:09,310
that I do. This is what everybody
does when they complain.

792
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,340
You can't just complain.
You have to establish credibility.

793
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,940
Like when people argue politics,
you know,

794
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:20,320
they sit there and they
go, Hey, I'm a democrat.

795
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,500
I'm for gay marriage,
upper legalizing pot.

796
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,120
But this Obama has gone too far
or the other way around. You know,

797
00:49:28,121 --> 00:49:31,150
I'm fucking Blah, blah blah.
But this Trump, this is what
everybody does. All right?

798
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:36,170
He goes, I'm not super
religious. Oh, Gj age.

799
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:39,940
You're not super religious. But I
obviously said something about your God.

800
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:41,021
All right,

801
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:45,610
but you took it too far when you trash
Jesus at anyone who believes in them.

802
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,860
When the fuck did I do that through?
Do you understand that this is unscripted?

803
00:49:50,861 --> 00:49:53,140
I don't remember half the
Shit I said today. I mean,

804
00:49:53,141 --> 00:49:56,350
if you want to take it
seriously, by all means, he goes,

805
00:49:56,351 --> 00:50:00,940
you take your shots here and there,
which is tolerable. But in the 1228,

806
00:50:00,941 --> 00:50:05,490
17 replayed portion of the podcast,
uh,

807
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:08,620
it was just too much. Oh,
I gotta listen to that one.

808
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,110
I didn't hear it the first time and I
wish whomever is picking the replays had

809
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:17,770
more of an inkling than to
play that expert expert.

810
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:22,270
As much as I wish you didn't say it.
Um,

811
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,160
well aren't you glad that they played it?

812
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,670
So now you can know how bad a person I am.
A,

813
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,600
this probably won't matter to you
because at this point you don't need me

814
00:50:32,601 --> 00:50:33,280
anymore.

815
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,140
Oh,
come on.

816
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,770
The end of the comedy hut.
That being said, I bet

817
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:44,430
big promoter and a
supporter for a long time.

818
00:50:45,830 --> 00:50:49,490
This has to be a woman.
This they're just doing,

819
00:50:49,491 --> 00:50:51,440
they're just going 100% guilt.

820
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,810
I'm sure you will never read this as you
probably have a screener at this point.

821
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:01,870
Uh, just taking a shot. I do
wish you continued success.

822
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,520
I'll look at this and they're
still going to go out as a class.

823
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,960
This person's a class act and nothing
but the best for you and the lovely Mia.

824
00:51:08,990 --> 00:51:11,630
It's Nia with an end.
You know what? I'm a,

825
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:17,200
I'm saying goodbye to you the amount of
times that I said Nia on the podcast and

826
00:51:17,361 --> 00:51:22,040
you still don't even know my wife's
name and you have the nerve to get upset

827
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,830
with me cause I trashed
the old Jay star there.

828
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,310
Why don't you,
what would Jesus do?

829
00:51:28,311 --> 00:51:31,200
Jesus would forgive me and continue
to listen to the podcast, wouldn't he?

830
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:35,960
I would think. Um, anyways,
uh, that being said,

831
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,470
or being a bump up of, uh, uh,

832
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:42,770
for the lovely mia and
your daughter in there, uh,

833
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:46,240
Boston sucks and go fuck yourself.
Um,

834
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:52,190
ps checkout, Gary Newman's new
album, all synth, but really cool.

835
00:51:52,970 --> 00:51:57,770
Alright, pss, if you don't read
this or if you do read this,

836
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:01,300
don't use a southern accent because
I'm from New York. Lol. You know what?

837
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:06,140
You're going to be back. I gotta
fill in. You're going to be back.

838
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,120
Um,

839
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:13,120
I love these fucking people that it's
just like all the dumb shit that I say.

840
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:17,300
I've trashed people that smoke weed.
I trash women.

841
00:52:17,330 --> 00:52:22,010
I trust Jesus. I trash fucking
anybody who's a Republican.

842
00:52:22,011 --> 00:52:26,120
Anybody who's a Democrat, all of this
fucking shit. And everybody listens.

843
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:28,580
And listens and listens, then
all of a sudden, once you know,

844
00:52:28,581 --> 00:52:33,581
fucking comes into your world like I the
trash above ground pools and all of a

845
00:52:34,041 --> 00:52:35,660
sudden I got to listen to somebody going,
hi.

846
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:36,833
You know,

847
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:41,010
just because I can't afford to
take a goddamn hole in my backyard.

848
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:43,450
You know,
look at that right there.

849
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:47,170
Offensive to southern people is if there's
people up north that can't afford to

850
00:52:47,171 --> 00:52:50,380
fucking have a backhoe come in there and
whatever the fuck it is that they do,

851
00:52:50,710 --> 00:52:53,810
right, dig into the Goddamn ground. Um,

852
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:58,810
hey. You know what I mean? All right.
See you draw the line of Jesus. Well,

853
00:52:58,811 --> 00:53:00,280
there you go.
I mean,

854
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:03,820
as far as my limited understanding of
Jesus and what exactly it was he was

855
00:53:03,821 --> 00:53:06,820
trying to prove with all this party
tricks with the fish and the bread over

856
00:53:06,821 --> 00:53:10,090
there. Um, I think he was a
very forgiving person, sir.

857
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:15,150
So I think if you're truly into the
teachings of Jesus and you're truly strong

858
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:16,780
enough spiritually,

859
00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:21,990
you can handle one 20 minute fucking
clip from a Goddamn podcasts from a few

860
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:25,560
fucking years ago. You know what the real
thing is here, sir, is you need to up,

861
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,790
okay?

862
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:30,930
What I'm saying is not going to infiltrate
into your fucking soul and all of a

863
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:33,450
sudden make you possess and
have you kill your whole family.

864
00:53:33,630 --> 00:53:35,460
Why can't you just look
at me and feel fit?

865
00:53:35,530 --> 00:53:39,030
Sad for me that I'm going to go to hell
and that you're going to go to heaven.

866
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:42,150
You're going to be on a
little puffy cloud. There is.
I'm burning forever, right?

867
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:47,330
Why don't you just look at it that way,
all right?

868
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,310
It's not that he's leaving. It's that
you know all the dumb shit that I say,

869
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:55,980
all of the dumb shit that I fucking say,

870
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:00,060
and then that one thing you
look past everything else,

871
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:04,890
all right? But whatever, you know
it'd be more pouchy. God bless you.

872
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,840
God bless you in your search.

873
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:11,870
I wish you well on your search to
a Jesus only positivity podcast.

874
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:17,840
All right? All right.
Your journey to Aa. Bear,

875
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,900
dare Billy to Shift Drinking Albino
ginge dad bod once a solid c cup now as

876
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:28,830
solid eight cups or moves a
lot and a mouthful. All right,

877
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:34,400
me and another friend of bill w agree
that you're qualifying story for AA is

878
00:54:35,791 --> 00:54:40,460
unfolding perfectly. All
right, here we go. Um,

879
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:43,980
I'm an alcoholic,
so you must be an alcoholic.

880
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:52,110
All right, I'm going to lose this guy's
offense. I hate fucking Aa people.

881
00:54:53,070 --> 00:54:58,070
There's nothing more self involved than
someone who has an addictive personality

882
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:02,880
and all they think is whatever happened
to them, whatever they're going through,

883
00:55:02,881 --> 00:55:07,881
you also have to be going through because
they are the center of the fucking

884
00:55:08,131 --> 00:55:12,930
universe. All right, from your
off the wagon on the wagon,

885
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:16,800
off the wagon to your,
let's try some controlled drinking.

886
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:21,090
You are perfect. A material, uh,

887
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,120
can't wait to hear about your surrender
and your acknowledgement that you lack

888
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,080
and that lack of power is your
dilemma. No, Jesus Christ.

889
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:34,560
Stop projecting all of your shit.
You fucking loser.

890
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:39,360
I fucking hate people in Aa. I really do.
Not all of them, but people like this.

891
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,670
Listen Dude,
just because you are under the sink,

892
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:46,460
turn your kid's birthday drinking fucking
mouthwash. Don't break my balls over.

893
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,180
I don't have to go to your
dumb ass fucking meeting.

894
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,600
I've gone to some AA meetings.

895
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:59,730
Do the stories you guys tell
my GI is on the fucking ground.

896
00:56:01,470 --> 00:56:05,550
You guys make me look
like a fucking fairy. Uh,

897
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,670
he's in denial right now.
The gag of gagging by dude,

898
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,380
I'm gonna tell you
something that I just did.

899
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:13,290
I just went off the wagon for six days,

900
00:56:14,100 --> 00:56:17,970
drank like an animal yesterday
in while I was drunk,

901
00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:22,770
effortlessly said, you know, and I'm
not drinking anymore effortlessly.

902
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:27,070
I didn't have to surrender and say,
I have no power over this.

903
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,300
Bad,
bad.

904
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:34,320
I don't need to go down to your dumb ass
group and smoked cigarettes and eating

905
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:39,980
donuts with all you guys down there
with the a blown out fucking wallflower

906
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:45,840
noses. All right, I'm fine. Anyways.

907
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,190
And your discovery that there is
a power greater than yourself.

908
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:54,510
One Who can solve all your problems.
Yeah.

909
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:58,580
Or one that you can dump all your shit
on. It's a great life. You could even say,

910
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:02,670
even say it's a life second to none.

911
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,900
One day at a time. Easy. Does
it keep it simple, stupid.

912
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:11,460
I just can't wait to hear you speak
from the podium delivering a message of

913
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:15,000
hope.
It's not the meetings you make.

914
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:19,820
It's the steps you take. Thankfully
there are only 12 of them. Ah,

915
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,820
love your biggest 32 year
old blonde Nigerian fan.

916
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:31,110
Um, Hey, God bless you in your
sobriety. But no, all right, whatever.

917
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:35,700
Um,
uh,

918
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:40,690
this is how my sobriety works. I just like
how I feel when I'm sober from a tall,

919
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:43,330
I like how I look.
I like the weight that I become.

920
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:48,960
It's total vanity and there becomes
a point in your life where you just,

921
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:52,600
you just too fucking old to drink.
It just beats the shit out of you.

922
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:55,570
So, uh, thank you sir.

923
00:57:55,571 --> 00:58:00,160
But I don't need to go down
there and surrender and you know,

924
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:04,330
I'm telling you right now,
if you think you're a fucking alcoholic,

925
00:58:04,331 --> 00:58:08,650
go to a Goddamn AA meeting. These
fucking people, I swear to God,

926
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,440
they'll tell stories where like,
like they're sitting there,

927
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:14,830
half their nose is hanging off
their face and that just go in like,

928
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:19,180
so I take some duct tape and I fucking
tape my nose back onto my face.

929
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:24,220
And all I'm thinking is I got to go back
to the liquor store and get more booze.

930
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:25,054
Man.

931
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:33,840
When I got arrested for drinking and
driving about 30 fucking years ago,

932
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:38,640
um, I remember why I was required to
go to two AA meetings and I was like,

933
00:58:38,641 --> 00:58:42,960
these people are out of their fucking,
and every story was that they would do.

934
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,480
And then I belted my wife in the face.

935
00:58:46,050 --> 00:58:49,950
I actually hit my wife over
the head with our own child.

936
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:53,100
And the crazy thing is, is I would
say, can like, you know what,

937
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:58,090
I got to go get a drink
and they'll look,

938
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,080
I shouldn't be laughing at people that
have that much of a fucking problem. Okay.

939
00:59:02,081 --> 00:59:06,820
But, um, I could tell you this, sir,
I don't need to surrender to anything.

940
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:10,950
All right.
I know that I,

941
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:16,020
there are times in my life when I drink
too much and I have the ability to look

942
00:59:16,031 --> 00:59:19,960
at myself, say I have a problem
and then fucking walk away from it.

943
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:25,970
MMM. That's it. All right.

944
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,340
And I want to tell you,
y'all want you to answer me.

945
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:33,620
Name one of your fucking Aa friends down
there that can come off the wagon and

946
00:59:34,021 --> 00:59:35,220
drank like I did.

947
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:40,090
You know the yesterday I
drank six out of seven days.

948
00:59:40,091 --> 00:59:43,450
I had two drinks one day I had a beer
the next day, then drink the next day,

949
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:48,490
had two drinks at the John
Mayer Chappelle thing,

950
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:55,290
and then had two drinks the next day
and then fucking got hammered at at the

951
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,880
Rose Bowl. And now I can just be like, all
right, fuck that. I'm not doing that now.

952
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:06,420
That's it. I can, I can do that, sir.
I'm sorry that you can't do that.

953
01:00:06,450 --> 01:00:10,450
I'm sorry that you need to go down
there and put your arms around a budget.

954
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,250
Well,
all go down together.

955
01:00:13,390 --> 01:00:16,840
They gotta give you a little chip.
Every little your little fucking cookie,

956
01:00:18,070 --> 01:00:21,820
you know. God bless you. I mean fucking
people might lose it on this podcast.

957
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:24,370
God bless you buddy.
If that's what the fuck you have to do.

958
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:26,843
MMM.

959
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:32,380
Are you one of those alcoholics too
who still a fucking cunt, you know,

960
01:00:32,381 --> 01:00:35,530
and then blames everything on your
fucking disease. Oh, sorry bro,

961
01:00:35,531 --> 01:00:37,300
I just got to let us shit coming up.
You know,

962
01:00:37,470 --> 01:00:39,130
you've got that built in fucking excuse.

963
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:41,473
MMM.

964
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,830
Anyways,
not saying they're all like that.

965
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:47,640
Cause I know a lot of cool people
that are in fucking Aa, but like, um,

966
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:50,160
I really think that if you're,
if you're an alcoholic,

967
01:00:50,161 --> 01:00:54,990
that when you're drinking your life
just like falls apart. It really does.

968
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,033
You know what I mean?

969
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:58,593
MMM.

970
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,070
I mean I wake up,
hung over for flights and it sucks.

971
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:08,400
And I definitely am not a casual drinker.

972
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:13,460
I'm definitely a fucking binge drinker
and I know that I shouldn't be doing that

973
01:01:13,801 --> 01:01:17,880
shit.
But if I actually had a real fucking job,

974
01:01:18,690 --> 01:01:23,520
that's my biggest problem is
I don't have a fucking job.

975
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:27,600
Okay.

976
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,790
So like I have to tell you like when,

977
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:32,260
okay.

978
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:35,920
You know, when I'm like really
fucking busy and I have shit to do,

979
01:01:35,950 --> 01:01:40,210
I don't really drink. But the thing that
like right now it's fucking Tuesday,

980
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,100
it's nine in the morning.

981
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:47,160
I'm sitting here in my fucking pajamas
and I could just sit here for the rest of

982
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,670
the, for the rest of the Goddamn week.
I don't have anything to do. I mean,

983
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:55,240
if I wasn't so fucking responsible,
patting myself on the back,

984
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,440
I mean there's a bunch of shit that I
could just put off to next week and,

985
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:04,150
and I could just sit here
drinking non fucking stop.

986
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:09,880
So that's the problem.
My problem is my fucking free time.

987
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,980
So, um, I'm gonna I, I respect the
fact that you're trying to help me.

988
01:02:16,030 --> 01:02:20,060
Um, my wife, my wife on the hand, uh,

989
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:23,820
I've told her a bunch of times saying, I
am I an alcoholic. She goes, God, Bill,

990
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:27,360
you're not an alcoholic.
You're not a fucking alcoholic.

991
01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:32,190
So I would think that she would know she
lives with me, but I appreciate it. Um,

992
01:02:33,540 --> 01:02:37,260
and all these going to say the whole time
as he's in denial Elo, the Loyola bug.

993
01:02:37,350 --> 01:02:40,860
And Excel. You know what alcoholics,
you'd like the like Madonna,

994
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,930
Madonna always just did over the top
shocking stuff, you know what I mean?

995
01:02:45,931 --> 01:02:47,250
And then if you'd been like Madonna,

996
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,370
that music videos sucked and
then they get to hide behind.

997
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:55,110
Well all I was looking for was the
reaction. It's art. Art is just, you know,

998
01:02:55,111 --> 01:02:58,660
you can't judge it and blah
blah. No, that fucking steaks.

999
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:02,340
Yeah.

1000
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:06,570
So there you go. Um, I don't know.
Listen, I'm open to the idea.

1001
01:03:06,571 --> 01:03:07,800
If I am an alcoholic,

1002
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:10,560
but there's no fucking way I'll
ever be able to go to a meeting.

1003
01:03:10,561 --> 01:03:13,470
There's no way I'm not going to go down
there and just not fucking laugh my

1004
01:03:13,471 --> 01:03:15,540
balls off. Listening to your, your,

1005
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:19,230
your fucking stories that would make
Keith Richards go. Jesus Christ.

1006
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:21,863
Um,

1007
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:23,623
okay.

1008
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:28,480
I know a guy that fucking, he
drank so much. He did a face plant,

1009
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:30,010
his fucking teeth.

1010
01:03:30,970 --> 01:03:35,050
One of his teeth bucket
went through his lower lip.

1011
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,001
All right.

1012
01:03:37,001 --> 01:03:42,001
Any woke up the next day with his fucking
lips looking like a goddamn duck bill.

1013
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,810
Any, any Jew immediately
grabbed the fucking, you know,

1014
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:51,840
a 40 ouncer it put a straw in it so
he could keep drinking as the alcohol.

1015
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,400
Most of it was going in his mouth.

1016
01:03:54,401 --> 01:03:57,930
Part of it was going through
the hole that was in his face.

1017
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:02,920
Yeah.

1018
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:06,000
As much as my moral is, I am, I'd
be like, all right, you know what,

1019
01:04:06,001 --> 01:04:10,680
I'm going to take a fucking year off
at this point. You know, so whatever.

1020
01:04:10,710 --> 01:04:11,910
I sir,
I actually,

1021
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:16,200
I think that there's different
degrees of abusing alcohol.

1022
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:18,390
I definitely abuse it.
Admittedly,

1023
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:23,040
I'm wrong and it's definitely gotten
not a control, but I'm like a habit guy.

1024
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:26,700
Like if I'm working out,
I'm fucking working out like a maniac.

1025
01:04:26,701 --> 01:04:28,710
If I'm sitting around
and I'm eating bad food,

1026
01:04:28,711 --> 01:04:30,750
I eat bad food like a fucking maniac,

1027
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:36,030
but not to the point of like
someone that has addiction.

1028
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:40,650
Like I, I'll lead bad to the
point I put on 1520 pounds.

1029
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,230
I don't have to be cut out of my house.

1030
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:48,270
I don't balloon up a hundred fucking
pounds the way somebody who's addicted to

1031
01:04:48,271 --> 01:04:49,104
food would.

1032
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,673
All right.

1033
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:56,510
And I'll go out and I'll go
on a fucking booze binge.

1034
01:04:57,020 --> 01:04:59,490
It'd be like, I got to knock this
off. What the fuck am I doing?

1035
01:04:59,491 --> 01:05:04,340
I got to knock this off and I'm
just kind of able to do it. And

1036
01:05:06,200 --> 01:05:10,860
uh, I feel like I have to apologize to
you that I'm able to do that. I'm sorry.

1037
01:05:10,861 --> 01:05:15,320
I look like I'm done right now.
I will have no problem going.

1038
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:18,310
I Dunno.

1039
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:22,210
As long as I fucking want to go,
you know,

1040
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,990
it's not like I'm never going to have a
glass of wine with a great fucking meal

1041
01:05:25,991 --> 01:05:30,070
again. But, um, I dunno, whatever.

1042
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:34,900
I appreciate your, uh, your concern. But,

1043
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:35,770
um,

1044
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:40,770
I am going to be sober now just out of
vanity because I got this new fucking

1045
01:05:42,251 --> 01:05:46,240
diet right.
And the Dean del Ray was telling me about.

1046
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,670
And when I do that,
when I,

1047
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:52,600
when I'm on his diet and if I just go
for a fucking walk around the block with

1048
01:05:52,601 --> 01:05:53,530
my lovely daughter,

1049
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:57,820
I do that a couple times a day and I'm
not drinking and I'm not eating sugar or

1050
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:01,540
anything like that. I barely
have to work out and, uh, and I,

1051
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:06,160
the fucking,
the everything just falls off you.

1052
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:12,490
Um, and it's the easiest way to stay in
shape and I fucking hate working out.

1053
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:14,980
So,
um,

1054
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:20,440
that's way more appealing to me then.
Um,

1055
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:24,010
you know, as much fun as, as I had
over the last fucking week. I mean,

1056
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:28,780
it's way more appealing at my age,
you know, and plus I got a kid,

1057
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:32,860
you know, I've got to have
a kid and I can't be like,
fucking, I just can't do it.

1058
01:06:32,980 --> 01:06:35,380
I just can't do it. I can't have it
in my fucking life and that's it.

1059
01:06:35,381 --> 01:06:39,130
So I don't need to go down there and do
all of that bullshit. All right. I'm,

1060
01:06:39,131 --> 01:06:43,870
I'm a comedian. All right. I
don't like groups. All right,

1061
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:48,850
lady. Who's bad at
arguing? Uh, dear Billy.

1062
01:06:48,851 --> 01:06:53,770
Backward balls backwards. False.
Uh, I'm actually a 15 year old girl.

1063
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,920
Oh,
Jay z.

1064
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,050
The fuck who the f Andrew, you'd
try to get me in trouble here. Uh,

1065
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:06,400
so I guess you couldn't say really
say that. I'm a lady. Oh my God,

1066
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:10,030
this is already creeping me out yet. But
I love your podcast and listen to a 24,

1067
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:14,950
seven because I feel like balanced needs,

1068
01:07:15,730 --> 01:07:17,890
oh,
balance needs to be restored to the world.

1069
01:07:17,891 --> 01:07:22,150
After all the females listening to
Dr Phil and loose women have gotten a

1070
01:07:22,151 --> 01:07:26,350
slightly fucked up view on things.
Um,

1071
01:07:26,351 --> 01:07:30,970
I respect that you're not going to let
mainstream media have the only say on the

1072
01:07:30,971 --> 01:07:34,300
truth. In other words, what you're
saying is you like to hear my opinion.

1073
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:38,760
I'm not always right, but you'll listen
to it. I appreciate that. All right.

1074
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,680
[inaudible] my whole life,

1075
01:07:42,490 --> 01:07:45,430
the 15 years of my life,
Jesus Christ,

1076
01:07:46,590 --> 01:07:51,220
that this shit in my house said for 15
years I've been meaning to get to it. Um,

1077
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:54,420
your whole life is 15 years.
That's incredible. Uh,

1078
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:59,200
my whole life I've been bad at arguing
either I say the wrong thing at the wrong

1079
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:04,201
time or I focus on the wrong point or
I'm easily manipulated by guilt trips,

1080
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,300
et cetera. Uh, whatever it is,

1081
01:08:07,330 --> 01:08:10,600
I can never get it right or
stand my ground. For example,

1082
01:08:10,601 --> 01:08:13,030
I have this one friend
who is literally three.

1083
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,950
I was the literal,
a literal three year old on the inside.

1084
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:20,080
I thought you said you were hanging
out with a three year old. I was like,

1085
01:08:20,081 --> 01:08:22,420
this is getting even more creepy.
Um,

1086
01:08:22,480 --> 01:08:25,900
I can't say shit to
her without her crying.

1087
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,290
One time she wanted some of my food,

1088
01:08:29,291 --> 01:08:32,590
but I told her that I hadn't had
breakfast and couldn't share that day.

1089
01:08:32,860 --> 01:08:37,570
She said to me, you're [inaudible], you're
so mean. What the fuck is your problem?

1090
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,980
What? Yeah, you got, you get
that person out of your life.

1091
01:08:44,450 --> 01:08:48,440
I just gave her some food cause I hate
it when people think bad about me.

1092
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,920
But inside I was like, bitch, what?

1093
01:08:52,730 --> 01:08:56,330
It took me like two hours to realize
that she didn't even think I was mean.

1094
01:08:56,331 --> 01:09:00,230
She just wanted the food and she knew
how to get it. Oh my God. You know,

1095
01:09:00,231 --> 01:09:01,064
something.

1096
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:06,640
Your thought process that it took me
till I was 37 to realize that you're way

1097
01:09:07,851 --> 01:09:08,930
ahead of the curve here.

1098
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:14,060
What's your realizing for the first time
in your life is that this people out

1099
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:18,920
there that are not good people.
See. So what I did was I, I,

1100
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:24,680
I went out into the world where you are
as a 15 year old and existed as that

1101
01:09:24,681 --> 01:09:29,681
person til about 37 before I actually
started to examine human behavior.

1102
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:32,750
And,
um,

1103
01:09:33,730 --> 01:09:34,421
yeah,
so what,

1104
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:39,190
where you are right now is when you
first start to realize that there's these

1105
01:09:39,191 --> 01:09:41,710
constant life.
Um,

1106
01:09:42,370 --> 01:09:44,950
what's going to happen is
like two or three days later,

1107
01:09:45,070 --> 01:09:48,190
or an hour later after the moment,
you're going to be like,

1108
01:09:48,370 --> 01:09:52,940
oh fuck yeah. She said Blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1109
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:56,920
And that cause she meant that it's
cause she, she wanted x, y, and Z. Well,

1110
01:09:56,921 --> 01:09:58,210
the more you do that,

1111
01:09:58,211 --> 01:10:00,850
the more you're going to be able to be
in the moment and you're going to catch

1112
01:10:00,851 --> 01:10:03,970
people in the moment. And then once
you're able to do it in real time,

1113
01:10:04,210 --> 01:10:08,410
people aren't going to be able to
fuck with you anymore. And then when,

1114
01:10:08,790 --> 01:10:11,740
and then the only thing you'll have
to learn how to do is the judgment.

1115
01:10:11,741 --> 01:10:13,180
Is this worth me?

1116
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,393
You know,

1117
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,830
applying this skill in real time.
Like yesterday,

1118
01:10:18,831 --> 01:10:21,350
that guy who turned around and yelled,
fuck you at Bart, nick and all that.

1119
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:26,180
There was like four of us
wanting him overtime. Rosebowl
not even worth engaging.

1120
01:10:26,181 --> 01:10:29,480
We all just stared at him
and then he didn't know what
to do. He yelled, fuck you.

1121
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:34,100
And then he turned around and he felt
good. He said, fuck you to four guys.

1122
01:10:34,101 --> 01:10:38,180
We didn't do anything. He feels good
in secure around his wife, you know,

1123
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:41,270
and nobody got kicked out.
Nobody had to fight or whatever.

1124
01:10:41,271 --> 01:10:43,490
And then there's other times when
you actually say something back,

1125
01:10:43,750 --> 01:10:47,240
somebody who's, I'll read the rest of
this, but um, right out of the gate,

1126
01:10:47,390 --> 01:10:49,610
you're being too hard on yourself,
right?

1127
01:10:49,611 --> 01:10:53,960
Most of the girls in my class are pretty
weak physically and it happens to be

1128
01:10:53,961 --> 01:10:57,770
that as a girl,
I have unnaturally broad shoulders,

1129
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,420
excuse the pun,

1130
01:11:00,110 --> 01:11:03,470
a and weigh about two pounds
more than most of them.

1131
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:08,480
The fact is hard to ignore when you're
staring at their can faces while the

1132
01:11:08,481 --> 01:11:12,530
giggle behind their hands.
I have violent tendencies,

1133
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:14,520
which I'm working on,

1134
01:11:14,580 --> 01:11:19,200
but I know I can beat the shit out of
them and that makes it so much harder to

1135
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:20,820
verbal,
verbally argue.

1136
01:11:22,090 --> 01:11:22,400
Uh,

1137
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:25,060
they're much better at it than me.
So even when I'm right,

1138
01:11:25,061 --> 01:11:27,810
I lose and I always end up
wanting to just uppercut,

1139
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:31,210
send an upper cut straight
to their fucking skull.

1140
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,723
MMM.

1141
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,640
Whatever.
All right.

1142
01:11:36,641 --> 01:11:41,020
I would love a few pointers as to what
to do in an argument and how to tell them

1143
01:11:41,050 --> 01:11:45,760
when I'm being manipulated before I start
latching onto the fucked up mind game.

1144
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:48,540
MMM.

1145
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:52,590
Of doing things. Some advice
would be great. Thanks a lot
and go fuck yourself. Ps,

1146
01:11:52,830 --> 01:11:56,310
me and my sister have a huge disagreement
agreement because it's my personal

1147
01:11:56,311 --> 01:11:58,110
opinion that guys,
whoever,

1148
01:11:58,111 --> 01:12:03,111
girlfriend should still be able to go
to strip clubs and have a good time

1149
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:05,600
without their girlfriend getting mad.

1150
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:10,601
My sister says that for me to say that
I must have no respect for myself and

1151
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,190
we'll end up with a piece of shit guy.
Jesus.

1152
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,620
Those are two extreme
opinions and my right,

1153
01:12:16,130 --> 01:12:19,610
or do I have some sort of self respect
issues that I'm not aware of yet?

1154
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:23,160
All right,
let me comment on the first fucking thing.

1155
01:12:24,230 --> 01:12:25,063
All right?

1156
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,870
Kids are mean. Kids bullied,
they gang up on you.

1157
01:12:28,900 --> 01:12:31,630
You never should resort to
physical violence, all right?

1158
01:12:32,050 --> 01:12:35,470
But what she gotta do is you
got to fight fire with fire.

1159
01:12:35,680 --> 01:12:39,670
So what you have to do, all
right, is nobody's perfect.

1160
01:12:39,671 --> 01:12:41,770
So you have to find that fucking thing,

1161
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:44,593
all right?

1162
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:47,250
You have to find that fucking thing,

1163
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:48,643
all right?

1164
01:12:49,420 --> 01:12:51,280
And you just get them with that,

1165
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:53,413
all right?

1166
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:56,110
And then they,
they know will hurt their feelings,

1167
01:12:56,620 --> 01:12:58,780
especially if they're good
looking popular people.

1168
01:12:58,781 --> 01:13:02,500
You can really fucking get
to them all right? Like,

1169
01:13:02,501 --> 01:13:06,220
here's something that I do that
I learned to do after years

1170
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:11,500
of arguing with people after my shows.
You know,

1171
01:13:11,530 --> 01:13:13,830
if somebody came up to me and
was like, Hey, let me tell you,

1172
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:17,200
sent it that stuff he said about where
and you're gonna fucking get Gaga.

1173
01:13:17,201 --> 01:13:21,070
And as they yelled, all of that, I used to
try to argue my points going, well, hey,

1174
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,540
you know,
it's just jokes.

1175
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,520
I also made fun of people
in that hurricane. You
didn't get offended by that.

1176
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,240
You know what I learned to
dope when someone was given,

1177
01:13:31,241 --> 01:13:33,760
when they were giving me
shit, I would just go, hey,

1178
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:37,360
you got something between your teeth.
That's what I would say.

1179
01:13:37,390 --> 01:13:40,060
Even though they didn't. And then
they would be so fucking mortified,

1180
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:43,290
they walk away and then they'd
be gone. Like you know, you know,

1181
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:46,450
sucking on their teeth and shit and
she should just shut them the fuck up.

1182
01:13:46,780 --> 01:13:49,210
So you need to find your version of that.
Okay?

1183
01:13:49,211 --> 01:13:53,470
So what I would do is I would
really study them. All right?

1184
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:56,950
And what you gotta do is you just got to
find something that's wrong with them.

1185
01:13:57,580 --> 01:14:01,900
Maybe their ear lobes are too big. And I
know this is very immature and this is,

1186
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:06,640
this is super fucking mean. And that is
an adult. I shouldn't tell you to do this.

1187
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:09,370
Cause adults go with those people.
They're not your real friends.

1188
01:14:09,371 --> 01:14:13,210
You don't need to stoop to their level
and they give you all this fucking air

1189
01:14:13,211 --> 01:14:14,890
quote, mature advice, but you know what?

1190
01:14:14,891 --> 01:14:18,850
That doesn't help you when you go
back into the shit the next day.

1191
01:14:20,110 --> 01:14:24,250
Tell a teacher, none of that
Shit fucking works. All right?

1192
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:28,990
Because those fucking evil
fucking consequate terrible
parents are going to find

1193
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:33,370
the time they're going to find you.
So that's what I would do.

1194
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:37,870
All right? There's no way. One of them
doesn't have a slightly crooked nose.

1195
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:42,370
There's no way one of them's titty.
Is it a little bit bigger than the other?

1196
01:14:42,371 --> 01:14:46,090
Or maybe they had nipples point down this
something fucked up about their chin.

1197
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:48,580
If you know you got to
fight fire with fire,

1198
01:14:48,581 --> 01:14:53,080
if they're talking about you fucking
shoulders, all right? First of all,

1199
01:14:53,081 --> 01:14:57,880
laugh at it. Learned to laugh at
yourself. All right, let's look at me.

1200
01:14:57,881 --> 01:15:02,020
I'm an old freckled ball,
redheaded count, okay?

1201
01:15:03,190 --> 01:15:07,330
In all of those things should really
end any dream that I ever had in life.

1202
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,820
But if you just roll with it,
if you steer into it,

1203
01:15:14,480 --> 01:15:18,430
and if I just be an old bald,
redheaded con then,

1204
01:15:18,460 --> 01:15:21,670
then w w what can you do to me?

1205
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:23,343
Okay.

1206
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:26,770
You just, you got to get comfy. So I
would get more comfortable with yourself.

1207
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:32,650
All right? And uh, I'm sure your
shoulders are fine and all of that stuff.

1208
01:15:32,890 --> 01:15:36,850
And when they make fun of your shoulders,
laugh, and then I would say, yeah,

1209
01:15:36,851 --> 01:15:41,230
my shoulders are as fucked up as your
crooked Teddy's or just you somehow you

1210
01:15:41,231 --> 01:15:44,080
laugh at your shit and then you fucking,
you get them.

1211
01:15:46,150 --> 01:15:48,560
It get them. Just tell them you
just go. Do you once, you know,

1212
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:52,940
just tell them they got bad
breath. You got any, some I
don't. You'll find, I wish,

1213
01:15:52,941 --> 01:15:55,700
you know what you could have if he just
could have sent me a picture of him,

1214
01:15:56,120 --> 01:15:57,080
I would have helped you out.

1215
01:15:57,081 --> 01:16:01,670
But then I would've gotten in trouble
because you're teaching them to bully

1216
01:16:03,070 --> 01:16:05,190
Bababababa. You know, all
of these people who want to,

1217
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:09,750
who want to fix problems with five minutes
on fucking doctor Phil, by the way,

1218
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:10,783
did I call it?

1219
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:15,530
You see that big scandal over there
now granted and is sitting until proven

1220
01:16:15,531 --> 01:16:16,364
guilty.

1221
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:20,690
All doctor Phil fucking bringing
the guests up a notch there.

1222
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:26,510
All right, I punched a girl.
Woe is another one. Hey Bill,

1223
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:32,300
like your input on a
situation. Uh, I was recently,

1224
01:16:32,390 --> 01:16:33,980
I was recently at a concert,

1225
01:16:33,981 --> 01:16:37,610
some drunk skank accused me of
stealing her friend's phone.

1226
01:16:39,350 --> 01:16:43,160
Uh, I told her you got the
wrong guy, her and her fuck her.

1227
01:16:43,161 --> 01:16:48,161
And her father friend tried to wrestle
my phone away from me and I pushed them

1228
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,890
off.
Then she sucker punched me in the eye,

1229
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:56,920
big bruise bloody I and our friend
snatched my phone out of my pocket due to

1230
01:16:58,461 --> 01:17:00,680
work there.
Came up and I told them what happened.

1231
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:04,970
He didn't seem to believe and was
clearly buddy buddy with the girls.

1232
01:17:04,971 --> 01:17:08,570
So they go off and we're giggling around,

1233
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:14,570
giggling around. I don't want that. That
means after a few minutes I go up to a,

1234
01:17:15,710 --> 01:17:17,960
to a Fatso.
Oh,

1235
01:17:17,961 --> 01:17:21,590
I go up to Fatso and tell
her to give me my phone back.

1236
01:17:22,190 --> 01:17:24,770
She realized it was
mine in handed it over.

1237
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:29,900
As I went to walk away,
scag number one in a Douche bag,

1238
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:33,260
boyfriend accosted me
again and grabbed me.

1239
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:38,600
I punched both of them in the face
and then security escorted me out.

1240
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:42,590
I think I was justified to
hit her in this case. What?

1241
01:17:42,591 --> 01:17:46,650
Say you then go fuck yourself.
Uh, yeah, I see. I see.

1242
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:50,980
I don't have a problem with any
of that. I don't, no problem.

1243
01:17:50,981 --> 01:17:55,000
Someone gets physical with you, you
know, you take one punch to the eye,

1244
01:17:55,180 --> 01:17:57,490
you're all your physically fucked up.
You didn't do anything wrong.

1245
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,420
Some point you got to defend
yourself. All right. God bless you.

1246
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:05,770
I think he showed remarkable
restraint to only hit them both once.

1247
01:18:07,830 --> 01:18:10,810
That was an easy one. I wouldn't even,
I wouldn't even concerned about it.

1248
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:15,120
Not at all. And in fact, you probably made
both of them better people. Hopefully.

1249
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:19,410
Probably not. But you know, if I will, you
know, when you get punched in the face,

1250
01:18:19,411 --> 01:18:20,330
you know,
if you're an adult,

1251
01:18:20,370 --> 01:18:22,410
at some point you gotta be looking
at yourself going like, all right,

1252
01:18:22,411 --> 01:18:26,460
did I do something there? If you
didn't, then you're like, all right,

1253
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:29,280
this person's an asshole and I needed to
have them out of my life. But you know,

1254
01:18:29,281 --> 01:18:30,114
if you did,

1255
01:18:30,480 --> 01:18:33,420
you got to be that guy and that was kind
of shooting my mouth off there. Right?

1256
01:18:34,620 --> 01:18:38,510
That's what I would do. Um, all right,

1257
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,360
got two girls pregnant help.
Uh, dude, I can't help you.

1258
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:48,900
Um, there's no help for
this. Uh, I buckled down for
the next fucking 18 years.

1259
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:50,281
All right.
Hello Bill.

1260
01:18:50,281 --> 01:18:54,150
I have a big problem and I'm hoping
that you and the lovely Nia can help out

1261
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:54,841
with it.
All right,

1262
01:18:54,841 --> 01:18:58,440
let me start by saying that I don't live
in a trailer is something I'm a normal

1263
01:18:58,441 --> 01:18:59,700
26 year old guy.

1264
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:03,300
I was dating this girl and we broke up
a couple months ago when we broke up.

1265
01:19:03,301 --> 01:19:05,670
A couple of weeks later,
I met this little Hottie,

1266
01:19:05,700 --> 01:19:10,080
I started hooking up with her and then
I got a call a couple of weeks ago.

1267
01:19:10,560 --> 01:19:14,550
My Ex is three months pregnant
with my child and she's keeping it.

1268
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:18,670
I then broke things off with
the hottie. Well, guess what?

1269
01:19:18,671 --> 01:19:23,080
I knocked her up to buddy. Ah,
did you ever take a health class?

1270
01:19:23,081 --> 01:19:25,180
Do you know how to fucking
to help people get pregnant?

1271
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:29,290
Neither one knows the other is
pregnant and I have no idea what to do.

1272
01:19:29,710 --> 01:19:34,570
I broke things off with the Hottie to
work on being there from my ex and the

1273
01:19:34,571 --> 01:19:35,404
kid.

1274
01:19:35,980 --> 01:19:39,850
I want to be there for her and help
her out with all the prenatal stuff.

1275
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:43,900
It'd be a great dad. Now it seems
my life is not going to be that way.

1276
01:19:43,901 --> 01:19:48,220
The other girl wants to have the baby too.
I use protection with this girl,

1277
01:19:48,221 --> 01:19:52,690
but not enough, I guess.
What does that mean, dude?

1278
01:19:52,691 --> 01:19:55,600
If you use a condom, I would get
a maternity. Uh, first of all,

1279
01:19:55,810 --> 01:19:57,610
I would make both of them subject to it.
Okay.

1280
01:19:57,790 --> 01:19:59,560
Because you broke up for
a couple of months, right?

1281
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:05,110
Get a maternity test times to do not
give either one of them a fucking dime or

1282
01:20:05,111 --> 01:20:09,240
else, you know, in some states, the second
you start paying, that kid is yours.

1283
01:20:10,170 --> 01:20:12,350
That's the first thing
I would do personally,

1284
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,760
I would do it was tell
both of them you situation.

1285
01:20:14,761 --> 01:20:18,420
The second thing I would get more,
make more both of them get a fuck.

1286
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:22,290
Is it a maternity tests? A paternity
test. I said maternity, paternity test.

1287
01:20:22,291 --> 01:20:26,280
They go, oh, Jesus. Um,

1288
01:20:26,310 --> 01:20:28,770
the other girl wants the other
baby to blah, blah, blah.

1289
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:31,693
Uh,

1290
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:36,140
my ex was on birth control
yet I still knocked her up.

1291
01:20:36,141 --> 01:20:39,770
If I had to be with one of them, it would
be the new girl because she is hotter.

1292
01:20:40,850 --> 01:20:42,300
I'm a pig,
sue me.

1293
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:47,000
And we also like a lot of the same things.
What should I do?

1294
01:20:47,001 --> 01:20:49,640
I'm so sick in an exhausted
of worrying about this.

1295
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:53,240
I just want to do the right things.
Thank you. And Go fuck yourself. Well,

1296
01:20:53,241 --> 01:20:56,900
I would tell both of them what's going on.
I would get a paternity test,

1297
01:20:56,901 --> 01:20:57,770
not a maternity tests.

1298
01:20:57,771 --> 01:21:01,940
Get a paternity test and make
sure those are your kids.

1299
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:04,880
And I would, if you want to be with
the Hottie, be with the hottie.

1300
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,910
There you go. And then I would
stay in the life of the other one.

1301
01:21:10,110 --> 01:21:11,080
That's what I would do.

1302
01:21:11,430 --> 01:21:16,430
And I would s fucking get a vasectomy
or cut up a garden hose because whatever

1303
01:21:16,921 --> 01:21:21,780
the fuck you're using is not working.
I'm all right. That's the podcast.

1304
01:21:22,830 --> 01:21:26,610
Oh, it's a long, one hour and 20 minutes
here. Happy new year to everybody.

1305
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,000
Uh, good luck to Ya. Um,

1306
01:21:30,030 --> 01:21:33,480
I apologize to anybody in Aa
or whatever the fuck it is.

1307
01:21:35,070 --> 01:21:39,900
Um, and that's it. I'm sipping
my tea, going to go eat healthy.

1308
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:44,640
All right. And I will go back to booze
at some point if I fucking want to,

1309
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:48,970
cause I don't think I have a
problem. All right, that's it. Uh,

1310
01:21:48,990 --> 01:21:50,550
I'll check in on you on Thursday.
