you like 97% of the world scientists

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700
you like 97% of the world scientists
 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.220
you like 97% of the world scientists
very close to 100% of the world

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230
very close to 100% of the world
 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.500

scientists are very concerned about
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.610
scientists are very concerned about
climate change and so why aren't some

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
climate change and so why aren't some
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.889

people concerned about it when media

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899
people concerned about it when media
 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.910
people concerned about it when media
outlets were allowed to be consolidated

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920
outlets were allowed to be consolidated
 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.229
outlets were allowed to be consolidated
in the 1980s then it developed these two

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239
in the 1980s then it developed these two
 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.660
in the 1980s then it developed these two
factions like that I don't remember it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670
factions like that I don't remember it
 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.200
factions like that I don't remember it
having and by that I think two factions

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
having and by that I think two factions
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.349
having and by that I think two factions
are a normal course of events where you

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359
are a normal course of events where you
 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.390
are a normal course of events where you
have males and females and boys and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
have males and females and boys and
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.270
have males and females and boys and
girls whether it's fruit flies or

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280
girls whether it's fruit flies or
 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.050
girls whether it's fruit flies or
dandelions or you and me and in the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
dandelions or you and me and in the
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.969

World Cup soccer you end up with two

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
World Cup soccer you end up with two
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.830
World Cup soccer you end up with two
teams the World Series Baseball you end

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
teams the World Series Baseball you end
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.120
teams the World Series Baseball you end
up with two teams it's really hard to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130
up with two teams it's really hard to
 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.850
up with two teams it's really hard to
have three teams and so I think and we

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860
have three teams and so I think and we
 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.870
have three teams and so I think and we

have divided into two camps but from our
 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.780
have divided into two camps but from our
point of view and the science

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.310
2016 was the hottest year on record and
your guys the people that foxnews

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320
your guys the people that foxnews
 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.100
your guys the people that foxnews
heretofore supports and this would not

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110
heretofore supports and this would not
 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.890
heretofore supports and this would not
take either bet $40,000 wouldn't take

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900
take either bet $40,000 wouldn't take
 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.380
take either bet $40,000 wouldn't take
the bet could have been theirs I'm good

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390
the bet could have been theirs I'm good
 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.440
the bet could have been theirs I'm good
for it

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450
for it
 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.690
for it
