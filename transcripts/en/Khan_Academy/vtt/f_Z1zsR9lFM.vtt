00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.250
SALMAN KHAN: I'm here at
Stanford Medical School

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.210
with Neil Gesundheit,
who's a faculty member here

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.046
at the med school.

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:09.229
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Hi, Sal.

00:00:09.229 --> 00:00:11.270
SALMAN KHAN: So, what are
we going to talk about?

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:13.020
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Well,
the topic for today

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.500
is endocrinology, which
is the study of hormones.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.930
And the word hormone is
derived from the Greek word

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.170
which means arouse the activity.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.610
And what hormones do is they're
chemical messengers that

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.540
are made at one part of
the body and typically go

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.620
to another part of the
body to, as suggested,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.822
arouse the activity and give
function to another organ.

00:00:34.822 --> 00:00:36.280
SALMAN KHAN: So
they're essentially

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.020
kind of signaling,
a way to communicate

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.390
between one part of
the body and the other.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.800
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Exactly.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.380
They're very sophisticated
communicators.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.640
I think that's a perfect term.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.306
And I think the other
way to think of it

00:00:44.306 --> 00:00:46.520
is our body communicates
in some ways directly.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.140
For instance, nerves
innervate muscle.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.890
And when you want to
contract your muscle,

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.306
you give a signal from your
brain, it goes down the nerve,

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:55.140
and it directly
attaches to the muscle

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.060
and causes it to contract.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.120
Whereas, hormones are more like
the Wi-Fi of the human body.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.720
They're wireless.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.599
They are made at one place.

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.980
They go into the bloodstream,
which is like the airwaves,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.010
if you will.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.220
And then they work on another
part of the body at a distance,

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.610
without directly connecting
to that part of the body

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:20.860
mechanically.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.850
SALMAN KHAN: And hormones, are
they a specific type of protein

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:24.670
or a specific type of chemical?

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.980
Or are they really anything that
does what you just described?

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.771
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: It's
pretty much anything,

00:01:28.771 --> 00:01:30.674
but they fall into
two major categories.

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.340
There are small
molecules that typically

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.400
derive from amino acids.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.470
And those molecules
are just 300 to 500,

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.360
at most, daltons, which are
molecular mass units, up

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.060
to large proteins
that can be hundreds

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969
and hundreds of
amino acids in size.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:47.760
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.926
So anything, anything that
really has this signaling

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:50.790
function.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.750
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: That's right,
would be considered a hormone.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.625
And the other thing is
we talk about hormones

00:01:54.625 --> 00:01:56.210
in three sort of subcategories.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.901
We call some of them
endocrine hormones,

00:01:57.901 --> 00:01:59.650
where they really get
into the bloodstream

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.804
and work at a far distance.

00:02:01.804 --> 00:02:03.720
And we'll give some
examples with your diagram

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.240
right there in just a minute.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.280
But there are others that are
called paracrine hormones.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.640
And paracrine hormones are
more regionally active.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.210
So they might be made, let's
say, in one part of the body

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.760
and work within a small distance
of that site of synthesis.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.260
And then the third category,
which is less common,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.780
would be autocrine hormones.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.160
And the autocrine
hormones are actually

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.700
made directly at one cell
and work on that same cell

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.869
or in this cell right next door,
at a very, very small distance.

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:34.660
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:02:37.492 --> 00:02:38.950
So, the endocrine
hormones, I think

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.158
I have a mental model for it.

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:43.589
They're kind of released far
away in the body someplace.

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:45.380
If they're picked up
by the right receptor,

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.080
they'll have the right function.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.891
The paracrine hormones,
is their effect small

00:02:49.891 --> 00:02:52.140
because they only are able
to travel a small distance?

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.970
Or is it something else?

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.740
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Typically
the paracrine hormones

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.120
do get into the bloodstream,
but the concentration

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.810
of the receptor, the receiving
end, as you suggested,

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.490
is right close by.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.510
So what tends to make
a paracrine hormone

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.630
work regionally is that the high
concentration of the receptors

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.640
are very close to the
site of synthesis.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.760
And the same with autocrine,
is often they're made,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.190
and there's a very high
concentration of the receiving

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.250
end right at that cell,
right next to that cell.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.250
SALMAN KHAN: And this
might be a silly question,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.220
but it's called endocrinology.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.622
Are there paracrinologists?

00:03:27.622 --> 00:03:29.330
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Well,
it's a good point.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.150
I don't think so.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.810
I think we just, perhaps
because the paracrine function

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.820
of hormones was
discovered later,

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.569
we still carry this all under
the umbrella of endocrinology.

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:38.360
SALMAN KHAN: Right.

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.190
So all of hormones
is endocrinology,

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.175
even though endocrine
hormones are

00:03:41.175 --> 00:03:42.520
the ones that act
at far distances.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.110
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: That's right.

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.390
I think that's a good
way to summarize it.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.620
Now I like the diagram
that you created here

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.250
because it illustrates some
of the major endocrine organs,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.070
the ones we'll be focusing
on in later lectures.

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.690
So the first one that you
showed very nicely in the head,

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.745
at the base of the brain,
is that orange structure.

00:03:57.745 --> 00:04:00.410
And that would be
the pituitary gland.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.350
That's right.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.970
And the pituitary gland
is called the master gland

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.540
because from the
pituitary, we make hormones

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.230
that work on yet other organs.

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:10.640
So I'll give you an example.

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.680
One of the hormones that's
made by the pituitary

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.600
is called thyroid
stimulating hormone, or TSH.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.970
And after it leaves
the pituitary,

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.459
it goes into the
circulation and it

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.260
acts on the thyroid
gland, where there

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.280
are high receptors for TSH
on the surface of the thyroid

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.250
cells.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.950
And it stimulates the thyroid
gland to make thyroid hormone,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.265
typically thyroxine T4
or triodothyronine, T3.

00:04:35.265 --> 00:04:37.640
Those would be the two main
circulating thyroid hormones.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.830
SALMAN KHAN: And
what do those do?

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.621
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Those
regulate metabolism,

00:04:40.621 --> 00:04:43.220
they regulate appetite,
they regulate thermogenesis,

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.050
they regulate muscle function.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.509
They have widespread activities
on other parts of the body.

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.841
SALMAN KHAN: But it kind of
upregulates or downregulates

00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:51.370
the entire body
and the metabolism.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.620
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: That's right.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.240
So someone with
hyperthyroidism would

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.000
have very high metabolism.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.240
You may know the
classic picture someone

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.892
with a high heart rate, rapid
metabolism, weight loss.

00:05:00.892 --> 00:05:02.600
That would be someone
with excess amounts

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.950
of thyroid hormone.

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.170
And then you see pretty
much the inverse picture

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.950
when someone has a deficiency
of thyroid hormone and someone

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.020
with hypothyroidism.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.932
So it's critical to maintain
just the right amount of almost

00:05:12.932 --> 00:05:14.890
all of these hormones,
and the thyroid hormones

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.100
are good examples of this.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.990
But the ultimate regulation
is from that pituitary gland.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.870
SALMAN KHAN: This is
kind of the master one.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.310
It sends a signal there, and
then that kind of does the--

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.400
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: That's right.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.180
And we'll talk later
about feedback loops,

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.150
because how does the pituitary
know when to stop making TSH?

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.990
And basically,
like a thermostat,

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:33.280
it can sense the levels
of thyroid hormone.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.460
And when those levels are
just at the right level,

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.210
and not too high, it'll decrease
the amount of TSH it makes.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.300
If the levels are too
low, it'll increase

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:42.670
TSH to try to stimulate the
thyroid gland to make yet

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.530
more thyroid hormone.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:45.650
SALMAN KHAN: Very cool.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:46.450
And what else do we have here?

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.770
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: OK.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.686
So the other hormones,
some of the major ones.

00:05:48.686 --> 00:05:51.700
The pituitary, in addition to
making the thyroid stimulating

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.570
hormones, it makes
a hormone called

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:57.840
ACTH, adrenal
corticotrophic hormone,

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.730
which acts on the
adrenal cortex.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.310
And the adrenal is
that gland exactly

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.590
that sits on top of the kidney.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.850
And the outer layers
of the adrenal gland

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.875
are the adrenal cortex, and
those are stimulated by ACTH.

00:06:11.875 --> 00:06:14.000
SALMAN KHAN: And they're
not related to the kidney.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.370
They just sit on top there.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:16.495
They're structurally there.

00:06:16.495 --> 00:06:19.260
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Right They're
related only in that sense

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.540
that the blood supply is rich
like the kidneys' blood supply,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.100
and they happen to
sit above the kidney.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.160
And they're called
adrenal because they're

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.110
adjacent to the kidney,
which is the renal part.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.680
SALMAN KHAN: That should
have been obvious.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.596
I never realized that.

00:06:32.596 --> 00:06:35.200
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: But
they don't per se

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.840
filter blood or do any
of the key functions

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.179
that the kidney serves.

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:39.970
SALMAN KHAN: I see.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:41.177
And what's their role?

00:06:41.177 --> 00:06:42.760
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: So
the adrenal glands

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.900
make the adrenal
hormones like cortisol,

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.930
which regulates
glucose metabolism

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.100
and is important to maintaining
blood pressure and well-being.

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.850
And then it makes
mineralocorticoids

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.790
like aldosterone, which is
important for regulating

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.020
salt and water balance.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.150
You also have adrenal androgens,
which are somewhat important.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.100
And those three hormones
are the main hormones

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.200
made by the adrenal cortex.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.230
The ACTH primarily
regulates the cortisol

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:14.410
and the adrenal androgens.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.360
And there's another
system that regulates

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.095
the mineralocorticoids that
we'll talk about later.

00:07:19.095 --> 00:07:21.220
SALMAN KHAN: OK And we have
a few more organs here.

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.480
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Yeah.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.200
So Also add out
of the pituitary,

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.010
we make luteinizing hormone and
follicle stimulating hormone.

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.920
Those would be
abbreviated LH and FSH.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.650
And those act on the gonads.

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:36.820
So in the male, it'll act on
the testes, and in the female,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.930
it'll act on the
ovaries to stimulate

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:44.360
the development of sperm
in the male and oocytes,

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.780
or eggs in the female,
and also the production

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.690
of gonadal steroids, primarily
testosterone in the male

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:51.650
and estradiol in the female.

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.776
SALMAN KHAN: Right And
are we missing anything?

00:07:53.776 --> 00:07:55.900
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Well,
there are two other hormones

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.970
that also derive from
the anterior pituitary.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.830
And those would
be growth hormone

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.711
that's critical for optimal
growth of long bones.

00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:05.710
SALMAN KHAN: The pituitary
really does do a lot.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.920
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: It does.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.570
Yeah.

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:10.740
SALMAN KHAN: So it's HGH,
human growth hormone.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.010
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: Yeah.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:13.301
Human growth hormone, and
that would act on long bones,

00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:14.050
for instance.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.610
And then we would
have prolactin,

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:19.340
which is important in
women for lactation,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.500
being able to breastfeed
after delivering a child.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:22.846
SALMAN KHAN: And insulin is?

00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:24.470
NEIL GESUNDHEIT:
Insulin is key, but it

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:25.630
doesn't come from the pituitary.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.210
So now we're going to work
our way down a little bit.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.937
We talked about the thyroid
gland making thyroid hormone.

00:08:29.937 --> 00:08:31.770
And then when you get
to the pancreas, which

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.440
is that yellow structure
right in the middle,

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.640
inside the pancreas,
there are small islands

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.940
called the islets of Langerhans.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:43.740
And the islets
within the pancreas

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:48.310
make endocrine hormones
like insulin and glucagon.

00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:49.780
But insulin is vital.

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.400
Without insulin,
you have diabetes.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.890
And without insulin, you don't
transport glucose into muscle

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:59.080
and remove glucose from
the bloodstream normally.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.850
The absence of
insulin can produce

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.477
all of the symptoms of diabetes
that we'll talk about later.

00:09:03.477 --> 00:09:05.310
SALMAN KHAN: It seems
just structurally, you

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.750
have the pancreas right here.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:08.710
You have the adrenal
glands right there,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.310
that they're all near kind
of that interchange on the--

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:13.462
because they're all
so important to get

00:09:13.462 --> 00:09:14.670
to where they need to get to.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.461
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: That's
a good observation.

00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:19.059
They all have a lot of
venous drainage from them

00:09:19.059 --> 00:09:20.600
so that when they
make their hormone,

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.933
it gets into the bloodstream
rather quickly because they

00:09:22.933 --> 00:09:24.262
are vital structures.

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:25.220
SALMAN KHAN: Very cool.

00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.400
So I think we can
leave it there.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.170
And in the next video,
you have some pictures

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.510
that I think will be
pretty interesting.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:29.710
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: OK.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.890
Yeah.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:31.500
In the next video,
we'll talk about how

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.916
you have to the right amount
of the hormone or else things

00:09:33.916 --> 00:09:34.530
go awry.

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:34.960
SALMAN KHAN: Very cool.

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.610
Thanks a bunch.

00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:36.443
NEIL GESUNDHEIT: OK.

00:09:36.443 --> 00:09:37.510
Thank you.
