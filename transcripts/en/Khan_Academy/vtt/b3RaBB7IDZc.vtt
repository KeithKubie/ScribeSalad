00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:01.951
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:03.317
Today we are going to talk,

00:00:03.317 --> 00:00:04.944
skillfully and patiently,

00:00:04.944 --> 00:00:06.104
about adverbs.

00:00:06.104 --> 00:00:08.844
And what it is that adverbs do.

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:11.305
And in order to do that,
I think it might be

00:00:11.305 --> 00:00:15.138
useful to talk about
what adjectives do first.

00:00:17.365 --> 00:00:19.948
So adjectives can modify stuff.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:22.613
And I should have been clearer

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:23.889
in the last video,

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:28.349
and said that the stuff
they modify is nouns.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.089
But, I didn't wanna
introduce too many rules

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:33.017
and strictures.

00:00:33.017 --> 00:00:35.684
What adjectives modify is nouns,

00:00:37.828 --> 00:00:39.078
and only nouns.

00:00:39.966 --> 00:00:42.549
Adverbs modify everything else.

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:46.875
So adverbs modify everything

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.429
that's not a noun.

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:55.058
And the way we usually see
this applied, is with verbs,

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:56.710
and it's right there in the name too.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:57.917
Ad-Verbs.

00:00:57.917 --> 00:00:59.105
And this comes from

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:01.272
the Latin meaning on or to

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:05.460
verbs, action words.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:10.701
Adverbs are words that
you slap on to verbs,

00:01:11.897 --> 00:01:13.081
basically.

00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:15.428
What I imagine when I think of adverbs,

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:18.095
is I kind of see like a sticker.

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:21.533
Here's the sticker we've got we can say

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:22.366
"slowly".

00:01:24.854 --> 00:01:26.922
So we can take this thing

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:29.498
and turn it into a sticker.

00:01:29.498 --> 00:01:32.122
Move it around, do what we like.

00:01:32.122 --> 00:01:34.419
So, we can write a sentence like

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:35.336
Greyson ran

00:01:39.093 --> 00:01:39.926
slowly.

00:01:43.293 --> 00:01:46.293
And slowly here, refers back to ran.

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:48.972
It's how he ran.

00:01:48.972 --> 00:01:50.180
It's not really describing

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.017
Greyson.

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:54.056
It's modifying or describing

00:01:54.056 --> 00:01:55.889
the action of running.

00:01:56.772 --> 00:01:59.105
Pearl arranged the furniture

00:02:02.878 --> 00:02:03.711
slowly.

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:09.218
Little sticker that we
just, poof, put on there.

00:02:09.218 --> 00:02:11.403
But a word is also considered an adverb,

00:02:11.403 --> 00:02:14.490
if it modifies an adjective.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.675
So let's say adverbs

00:02:16.675 --> 00:02:17.675
modify verbs

00:02:21.898 --> 00:02:23.148
and adjectives.

00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:30.998
So we could say something like,

00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:31.831
"Vanessa

00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:35.456
was

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:37.653
very hungry".

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.259
Right, because hungry is an adjective,

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:45.303
and very, is doing this thing,

00:02:45.303 --> 00:02:47.636
where it's modifying hungry.

00:02:48.506 --> 00:02:50.691
It's not Vanessa wasn't very.

00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:54.476
You can't be very; very
is not an adjective.

00:02:54.476 --> 00:02:57.611
But it is a modifier, and
the word that it's modifying,

00:02:57.611 --> 00:02:58.655
is hungry.

00:02:58.655 --> 00:03:00.023
How hungry was Vanessa?

00:03:00.023 --> 00:03:02.299
Vanessa was very hungry.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.549
Vanessa could also be, slightly hungry.

00:03:07.711 --> 00:03:09.776
And this leads me to one of the most

00:03:09.776 --> 00:03:11.868
important things about adverbs.

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:13.236
Which is that generally,

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:14.903
they tend to have ly

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.648
on them.

00:03:17.648 --> 00:03:20.504
So generally the way to make an adverb,

00:03:20.504 --> 00:03:22.921
is to just take an adjective,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.197
and add ly to it.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.980
So you take the word slow,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:28.816
you add ly

00:03:28.816 --> 00:03:30.584
you get the adverb slowly.

00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:32.116
You take the word nice,

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:33.020
you add ly,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.621
you get the adverb nicely.

00:03:35.621 --> 00:03:38.712
If you take the adjective cheerful,

00:03:38.712 --> 00:03:39.916
add an ly,

00:03:39.916 --> 00:03:43.192
you get the adverb cheerfully.

00:03:43.192 --> 00:03:45.768
So adverbs modify everything
that isn't a noun.

00:03:45.768 --> 00:03:47.649
And that means that they modify verbs,

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:48.996
and adjectives.

00:03:48.996 --> 00:03:51.736
The way you make an
adverb most of the time,

00:03:51.736 --> 00:03:55.545
is by taking an adjective
and tacking on ly

00:03:55.545 --> 00:03:57.077
to the end of it.

00:03:57.077 --> 00:03:58.889
It's like a sticker, that you, poof,

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.972
put on top of a verb or an adjective.

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:06.065
That's what adverbs are,
and that's what they do.

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:07.153
And what you can do,

00:04:07.153 --> 00:04:08.849
is learn anything.

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:09.682
David out.
