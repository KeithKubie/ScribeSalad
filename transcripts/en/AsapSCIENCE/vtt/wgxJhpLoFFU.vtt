00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.160
Dreams are an amazing phenomenon -- and considering
you spend roughly 6 years of your life dreaming,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.040
it's quite curious that we often brush them
aside to be quickly forgotten. Night after

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.050
night our brains go to work and bring us some
of the most incredible, bizarre and often

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.530
seemingly random imagery and storylines. But...what
are dreams? And like the many science fiction

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.810
stories or movies, could we ever record and
figure out what we're seeing while we're dreaming?

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.369
You may have heard of people referring to
'brain waves' before, but have you ever stopped

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.439
to think: are these actual waves, and do they...
carry information? Are brain waves similar

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.710
to, say, radio waves? The answer is, yes;
both brain and radio waves are forms of electromagnetic

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.430
radiation -- waves that travel at the speed
of light. Every time you think, thousands

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.190
of neurons fire at the same frequency and
generate a wave. These waves oscillate at

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.989
around 10 to 100 cycles per second. Radio
waves, on the other hand oscillate at around

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.430
50...million to 1 billion times per second.
Scientists have long used this phenomenon

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.129
to measure brain activity and interface the
brain to electronic devices. It allows us

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.250
to see which parts of the brain are active
for different activities, and similarly which

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.869
parts of the brain are active during dreaming.
Strange as it may seem, we still barely understand

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:16.619
why we sleep let alone why we dream. Michael
from Vsauce does a fantastic job explaining

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.909
the main theories for why we dream. But there
are so many theories because we can't really

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.390
measure or know what people are dreaming about,
without waking them up and asking them. Of

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.170
course, this is subject to forgetting or other
errors. Unfortunately, there is no device

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.280
that exists to allow us to peer into the mind
of a dreamer...or is there?

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.030
Crazy as it sounds, scientists have created
a technique to do just that. This mind-reading

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.970
technology began with a functional MRI Scanner,
inside which subjects were shown simple pictures

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.740
made up of black and white pixels. The software
then finds patterns in the brain activity

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.570
that corresponds to the specific images. For
example, if the letter "T" was shown, the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.310
software would record exactly how the brain
reacted. After sufficient data, the subjects

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.380
were then shown completely different images,
and the software would predict and recreate

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.310
what it thought the subjects were seeing.
After being shown the word "Neuron" these

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.359
were the images the software generated.
But it doesn't stop there -- further studies

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:17.299
began to use more complex visuals during the
subjects sleep. In this case, they first had

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.029
the subjects fall asleep while in an fMRI,
and would wake them up in the middle of dreaming,

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:26.040
quickly asking them what they were dreaming
about. They then used thousands of images

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.049
from the internet to get a best approximation
of what the subject was seeing based on brain

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:35.099
scans. After doing this nearly 200 times with
each person, and plugging the information

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.959
into a learning algorithm, software was used
to predict and generate their future dreams.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.510
Though by no means perfect, it was clear that
the machines predictions were better than

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.370
chance, matching up with the dreamers description.
Perhaps even more shocking is a study that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.169
actually used video footage; after showing
subjects 2 hours of movie footage and analyzing

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:58.569
their brain activity, they then used a library
of 18 million, 1 second YouTube clips to match

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.639
the brain activity. Here are the results:
On the left are new, unrelated clips that

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:07.370
the subjects were later shown, and on the
right is what the software guessed they were

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.189
seeing, using a mashed up combination of the
YouTube clips as an approximation. All of

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.499
this based on their brain waves.
As these software programs become more and

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.919
more complex, we come that much closer to
accurately visualizing and recording our thoughts

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:25.779
and dreams. At which point, perhaps, we'll
have a few more clues into why we dream, in

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:28.620
the first place.
