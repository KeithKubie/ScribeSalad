00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.450
Android devices come in all shapes and
sizes, and tablet's are popular too.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.330
You want to make sure to provide the
best user experience for those users.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.010
The great thing is, it's easy to do.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.440
The next time you design and

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.970
implement an Android UI, make sure you
remember to think about adaptive design.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.360
Think about when.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.720
At what point does
the UI start to break?

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.240
Think about what?

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.960
What elements should you change and
in what ways?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.510
And then work on the how.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.409
Implement your adaptive UI
using resource qualifiers and

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.480
the techniques we described here.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.480
