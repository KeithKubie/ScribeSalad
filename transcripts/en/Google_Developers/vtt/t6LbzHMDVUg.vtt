MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Hi.

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:09.820
My name is Mamie
Rheingold, and I

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.560
will be your host for this
issue of Google Developers Live.

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.910
And today we're
focusing on DIY.org.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.610
DIY.org is a site,
and a community

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.050
where kids can learn new skills
and share what they've learned.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.860
And each member gets a portfolio
where they can show off

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.560
all the skills that
they've learned.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.250
Everything from
beekeeping and dancing,

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.520
to astronomy and filmmaking,
and rapid prototyping.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.180
And today, I am joined
by four different DIYers

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.120
from around the
world, all tuning in

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.380
through Google Hangout.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:44.712
And they've all earned
programming-related badges.

00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:47.170
So we want to learn more about
how they learned to program,

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.950
and how people like
you guys can help.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.760
So first, I want to turn
it over to Diana, from DIY,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.670
to tell us a little
bit more about DIY.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.790
DIANA WATTANAPONGSAKOM:
Yeah, so DIY, as you said,

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:00.650
is an online
community where kids

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.614
can learn different skills.

00:01:02.614 --> 00:01:04.030
And what's really
awesome about it

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.480
is that we see this sort of
community sort of dynamically

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.080
growing by themselves.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.459
Kids are basically teaching
themselves these skills,

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:13.000
and collaborating
with other members,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.510
in the variety
communities in ways

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.600
through creating
their own websites,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.410
or starting DIY newspapers, and
collaborating with one another

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.040
to complete projects, and earn
skills that they've sometimes

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.172
never even heard of before.

00:01:31.172 --> 00:01:32.630
MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
Cool, and so let's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.340
turn it over to the
DIYers themselves.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.204
I'd love for you guys to
each introduce yourself.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:40.120
ZACH: I'll start then.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.140
Hi my name is Zach.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.300
I'm a DIYer, both on the
site and I also work for DIY.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.090
So I think that's cool.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.680
So I'm 16.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.810
My favorite programming
skill, I mean I've done a lot.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.560
And I'm just kind of
testing when working.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.880
But definitely I like
the front-end developer

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.910
and back-end developer.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.970
Those are kind of my favorites.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.225
Of my non-programmer ones,
[? variety ?] and all that,

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:09.169
the photographer one is one
that's really fun to do.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:10.565
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Great.

00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:11.065
Zoe?

00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:13.920
ZOE: Hi.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.320
I'm Zoe.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:16.850
I'm eight years old.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:23.280
And my favorite DIY skill that's
not related to programming

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.790
is meme hacker.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.070
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Meme hacker?

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.194
Do you know-- what kind of
programming do you know?

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.800
ZOE: I program mostly in Python.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.799
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:38.298
Awesome.

00:02:38.298 --> 00:02:40.620
ZOE: Also in HTML.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.770
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Oh man,
front-end and back-end.

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.220
Cool.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.590
Eli, will you
introduce yourself?

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.740
ELI: Hello, my name is Eli
Cujo, and I'm on DIY and stuff.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.655
And I really like the
open sourcer DIY school,

00:02:57.655 --> 00:02:59.620
because really like
the whole community

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.200
aspect of coding
and stuff like that.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.590
And DIY as an open
source community

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.840
has helped me, as well
as other open source.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.810
So open source is a very good
learning resource for me,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.820
in helping me learn a lot
of stuff about coding.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.103
And then my other skill that I
like that's not part of coding

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:22.020
is the ornithologist skill.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.626
I really like that skill.

00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:24.750
It's about birds and stuff.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.630
And I really like birds and bird
watching and nature and stuff.

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.500
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Nice.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.870
And last but not least, Ginny,
will you introduce yourself?

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.740
GINNY: Hi, I'm Ginny.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm 11 years old.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.600
And I've earned Newb, I
think that's about it.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:53.810
But my favorite skill that
isn't programming is animator.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.205
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Whoa, cool.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:56.830
That's awesome!

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.850
You guys have done
so many things.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.740
I love it!

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.050
So just to learn a little
bit more about DIY,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.870
and why you guys
love it so much, Eli,

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.710
will you share with us your
favorite thing about DIY?

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.990
ELI: Yeah, my favorite
thing about DIY

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.779
is that it's, as I said before,
it's like an open community

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:19.990
that you could learn so many
things from other people.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.770
You could teach
other people things,

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.440
like there's no-- it's a
learning experience as well

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.420
as a fun one.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:34.290
A lot of times experiences
can be educational and fun,

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.860
but one is higher
than the other.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.970
But I like how DIY
is exactly 50%.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.630
It's really nice
how you learn a lot,

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.300
and you also have tons
of fun at the same time.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.380
It's very-- I like it a lot.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.470
That's my favorite thing, the
education and the fun balance.

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.100
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Yeah, and it
seem super collaborative, too.

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.210
I noticed you can comment on
projects, and fork projects.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.080
ELI: Yeah, it's really there's
lots of-- you don't just

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.520
post something and
then it's just there.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.950
You can comment
on it and fork it,

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.992
which means that people, if
they have the same idea as you,

00:05:05.992 --> 00:05:07.200
they could share it with you.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.820
They can show their
idea as well as yours.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.355
And then there's
favoriting, and then there's

00:05:12.355 --> 00:05:13.855
you can get featured,
as well, which

00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:15.920
is you're featured
on the home page.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.430
And it's like a community,
it's a very nice community.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.480
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.560
And since we want to learn
more about how you guys started

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.270
to learn programming,
Ginny, tell us more.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.750
So you've earned the Newb badge.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.100
So why did you start?

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.420
Why did you decide
to earn that skill?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.460
GINNY: Well, three
days after Christmas,

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.970
I dropped all my Christmas
presents, and went and followed

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.860
this link from the Newb skill,
which was to MIT's programming

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.107
website, Scratch.

00:05:51.107 --> 00:05:52.190
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Oh, cool!

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.640
GINNY: It's a programming
site for kids.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.180
It really got me started.

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:05.450
And then I got into
Khan Academy after that.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.080
And from there I
learned JavaScript.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:14.190
And I'm getting a
little bit into HTML.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.500
I'm really interested in that.

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.750
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: This
is all since Christmas?

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:19.470
GINNY: Yes.

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:20.767
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Whoa.

00:06:20.767 --> 00:06:22.100
GINNY: Not since this Christmas.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.110
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: OK,
I was going to say,

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.850
that would be crazy speed.

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:27.000
That's awesome!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.360
So you've been coding
for a year now?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.950
GINNY: Yes.

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.900
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Really cool.

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.130
And then, and so
Zoe, you're eight,

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.120
and I've heard that you've
known that you have wanted

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.650
to be a programmer
since you were five.

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.160
So I'd love to learn
more about what

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.840
inspired you to want
to become a programmer

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.610
and what do you want to do with
these skills when you grow up.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.700
ZOE: Well, my parents
introduced me to Khan Academy,

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.095
and my favorite part
of that was the coding.

00:06:58.095 --> 00:07:02.900
So then she introduced me to
another website for coding.

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.450
And then I started learning
Python from a book.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.560
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Whoa, cool.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.450
Have you made anything with
Python or any of the code

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.010
that you've learned?

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.697
ZOE: Not much yet, though.

00:07:17.697 --> 00:07:18.530
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: OK.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:19.880
Well, you've got an early start.

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.480
I feel good about your
future as a programmer.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.880
You've got a lot of
years ahead of you.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:31.730
And Zach, so you're
here and you've actually

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:34.330
grown up to be a
programmer as a teenager.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.680
So I want to hear
more about that.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:40.490
What's it like to actually
be a programmer for DIY?

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.390
And you're still in
high school, right?

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.240
ZACH: Yeah, I'm in high school.

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:46.590
I mean it's good.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.360
Yeah, I've always been
kind of a fan of teenagers

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.830
getting out and doing more
than the average part-time job,

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.720
which I guess is what
has led me to DIY.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:04.160
And so I started about a
year and a half ago, I guess.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.580
I mean, when I started I
definitely was not that good.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.820
I mean I thought
I was, but, hey.

00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.470
And it's just been
a really great ride.

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:17.380
I mean all the people
I work with are great.

00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:20.830
And they're great at mentoring,
and just overall good people.

00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:24.610
And I've learned so much and
I've done-- I've got to speak

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.450
and I've got to do so many
things because of programming,

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:30.880
which I think that's cool.

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.870
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Yeah, I'm
excited to see your project

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.330
later on.

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.250
Cool.

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.696
And so when you're
just starting,

00:08:38.696 --> 00:08:40.820
so I want to learn more
about how you guys actually

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.390
learned how to program.

00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:46.950
So Ginny, will you start to
tell us about how you learned?

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:51.400
You mentioned Scratch and
Khan Academy, earlier.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:55.800
GINNY: Well, I just
went into Scratch,

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.406
followed some of
their tutorials.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.130
And soon I was figuring a
lot of things out on my own.

00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:11.760
My first project was just
this picture of a ninja,

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:14.420
and if you pressed different
buttons on the keyboard,

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.140
then he would change poses.

00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:18.660
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Nice.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:20.410
Fighting ninja.

00:09:20.410 --> 00:09:23.030
GINNY: From there I
progressed so much,

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:26.890
in the first couple of weeks.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:32.430
And I just took off, and I
was making a lot of things

00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.400
from generators to platformers.

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:40.460
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:43.610
And Eli, will you share
with us more about how

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.380
you started to learn
how to program?

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:53.070
ELI: When I was younger,
when I was eight, I started,

00:09:53.070 --> 00:09:56.940
I got into-- I read
a lot, and I really

00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.870
want to start a website
about book reviews.

00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:02.670
It was sort of like
a dream or whatever,

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:05.165
and I researched a little
bit and I figured out

00:10:05.165 --> 00:10:06.790
that I could actually
do this, somehow.

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.820
And I used a couple
of small software.

00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.840
And I used HTML
mostly, and I sort of

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.500
started creating my website.

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.000
At first it started out
with just a blank background

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.730
and then a couple
of bodies of text.

00:10:17.730 --> 00:10:20.120
But then eventually, as
I learned more and more

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.125
through the internet,
my website progressed.

00:10:24.125 --> 00:10:26.000
And of course, it's not
published or anything

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.890
because it was just
sort of a page thing.

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:31.120
It wasn't on the internet.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:33.760
But that's how I
got into coding,

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.820
was I wanted to
have this website.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:37.950
And I researched
and I just found out

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.934
that, oh, it's
actually possible.

00:10:39.934 --> 00:10:40.850
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:44.210
And then how have you
progressed through your learning

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.940
through DIY?

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.390
ELI: Oh, well with DIY,
like as I said before,

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.040
I just knew just
HTML, just the basics.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.217
But then when I went
on DIY, the skills

00:10:56.217 --> 00:10:57.800
like a back-end dev
and front-end dev,

00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.560
introduced me to other types of
code, and how those codes work.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.210
Like Raptor, how it's
back-end dev and stuff.

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:10.220
And CSS, and that really
helps with spicing up

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.541
my HTML and stuff.

00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:15.540
I learned different codes
that could help me out

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:19.364
through my website
making, and other stuff.

00:11:19.364 --> 00:11:20.280
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.410
Yeah, cool.

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:25.992
And so most of our
listeners are grownups,

00:11:25.992 --> 00:11:28.780
and so I want them
to walk away knowing

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.100
how they can go help
kids like you to program.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.290
So Zoe, have there
been any adults

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:38.220
that have helped you along
the way and anything that

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.690
made it super helpful,
or not helpful

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:44.350
for you learn how to program?

00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:48.210
ZOE: Yes, my dad has
helped me with Python,

00:11:48.210 --> 00:11:54.820
and taught me how to make it so
you can, it asks you a question

00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:58.290
and you can type an answer,
and it will give you a result.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:11:59.290
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:04.200
Yeah, it's so magical
when it actually responds.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.770
Is there anything
that your dad has

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:10.138
done that's made it easier
to learn how to code?

00:12:10.138 --> 00:12:13.260
ZOE: Well, he gave me
the book about Python.

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:14.960
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Super helpful.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.990
What book is that?

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.960
ZOE: It's "Python for Kids."

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.910
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: Cool.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:23.220
Sounds like an
appropriate book for you.

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.640
Cool.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.820
Awesome.

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:29.360
I would love to
actually see a demo.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.360
So Zach, will you
share the coolest thing

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.217
that you've created with code?

00:12:34.217 --> 00:12:35.050
ZACH: Yeah, totally.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.060
So let me just pull it up.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.820
So, this kind of started
off as a joke project.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:46.200
It's called dogescript.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.800
So if you've ever seen the
doge meme on the internet,

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:54.250
which is quickly becoming very
overused, but it's still funny.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.852
I kind of started
this as a joke.

00:12:56.852 --> 00:12:58.310
Basically I was
like, what if there

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:02.240
is a programming language that
was based on the doge meme,

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.710
and would compile to JavaScript,
how-- all this copy script,

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:07.740
and type script.

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:11.330
And so, I kind of did
it one night as a joke.

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:14.850
And then this is what happened.

00:13:14.850 --> 00:13:19.070
A lot of people
started contributing.

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:21.920
Well, someone else had
posted it on Hacker News.

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.440
And it just kind of blew up.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.950
So a lot of people found it,
and it became this-- well,

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:31.000
so many people were
really into it.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.320
It's just cool.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.950
It's on GitHub, so like
open source MIT license.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:41.900
And people they've contributed
so many things, poll requests

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:45.330
and I mean there's 15
contributors for what's

00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:47.520
completely a joke language.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:53.810
But it's a good joke
language, but at the same time

00:13:53.810 --> 00:13:55.570
you could actually
program things,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.790
and people have, which
is really funny to see.

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:02.380
MAMIE RHEINGOLD: The
beauty of the internet.

00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:03.660
Love it.

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:04.970
And the Wowser.

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:06.280
That's great.

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.010
Cool.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.570
Well, this has been
super fun for me.

00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:14.530
Before we sign off, is
there any last advice anyone

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.890
wants to share to
the Google Developers

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.300
out there that are tuning in?

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.450
ZACH: I would say,
when you're trying

00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:26.980
to get kids and
teenagers interested,

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:29.860
don't over-force it on them.

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.130
So many people tried
to really force it.

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.210
If a kid or teenager doesn't
like it, they don't like it.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:38.920
And move on to something else
they're passionate about.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:40.740
That's kind of basic
advice I can give.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.380
I mean, that's for anything,
but really for programming, it's

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.340
definitely true.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.770
MAMIE RHEINGOLD:
Yeah, love that.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.270
And go help kids learn what
they're passionate about.

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:50.020
Thank you, guys.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.740
This has been super fun.

00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:53.410
And Google Developers
out there, I

00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:57.340
hope you've been inspired by
these young kids who already

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.890
know how to code, and
you're excited about going

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:03.160
out and helping more
kids in your community

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.110
learn how to code.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:06.370
There are some great
resources that they mentioned.

00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:09.155
And also remember to
check out DIY.org.
