00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[But does it work? Which of the following will our optimizer do?]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's see how well you really understand the optimizer we just wrote.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here I've written out 5 candidate optimizations--

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
A times 1 gets replaced by A--and what I'd like you to do

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
in this multiple-multiple choice quiz

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
is check all of the ones that our optimizer,

00:00:14.000 --> 09:59:59.000
as we just wrote it, will perform.
