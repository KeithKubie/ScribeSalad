JOEL SCHINDALL: Our grading
in the class is important,

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.000
but it's done a
little bit differently

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.220
from the way an ordinary
course is graded.

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.480
In an ordinary course, there's
a specific body of material,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.960
and so you can grade
on proficiency.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.170
Can the student solve second
order differential equations?

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.870
So you give them some second
order differential equations

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.850
on a problem set,
and if they solve it,

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.900
they get a good grade.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.630
And if they don't solve it, they
wouldn't get as good a grade.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.830
We're trying to teach a
way of thinking and being

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.920
innovative so we give them
exercises and presentations,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.450
and then we grade them on the
passion of their engagement.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.860
Some of them have better
presentation skills

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.640
than others.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.900
We're not looking at an
absolute mark, but we're saying,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.500
did you go outside the box?

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.160
Did you try something new?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.100
Given where you were when
you came into this course,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.840
did you increase your skill set
effectively and energetically?

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.210
And if you do, that's a
good grade in the course.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.890
And we actually give many--
many students get good grades

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.020
in a course like
this, because they've

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.640
elected to take a course to
enhance their capabilities.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.450
And that deserves a good grade.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.300
The ones who don't
get as good a grade

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.960
are the ones who simply
haven't participated as fully.
