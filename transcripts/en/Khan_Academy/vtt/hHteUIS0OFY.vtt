00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:01.840
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:03.214
try to get a better
understanding

00:00:03.214 --> 00:00:05.156
of the structure of the earth.

00:00:05.156 --> 00:00:06.530
And we're actually
going to think

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.210
about it in two different ways.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.880
So let me just draw half
of the earth over here.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.505
That's my best shot at
drawing half of a circle.

00:00:14.505 --> 00:00:16.880
And what we're going to do is
think about it in two ways.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.421
And on the left-hand
side we're going

00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:20.510
to think about it as the
compositional layers,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:21.585
or the chemical layers.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:22.960
So over here we're
going to think

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:31.887
about the chemical structure,
or the composition of the layer.

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:33.470
And on the right-hand
side we're going

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.945
to think about the mechanical
properties of the layer.

00:00:35.945 --> 00:00:38.070
And when I say the mechanical
properties I'm really

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.220
just saying is that layer
kind of a solid, rigid layer?

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.180
Is it kind of a liquid layer?

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.670
Or is it something in between, a
kind of a putty-like non-rigid,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.956
solid layer?

00:00:49.956 --> 00:00:51.580
So let's think about
it on the chemical

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.370
or the compositional side
first, because to some degree

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:55.930
this is simpler.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.210
So the outermost
layer is the crust.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.090
That's the layer that we're
sitting on right here, right

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.050
now, I'm assuming.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:04.080
I'm assuming you're
on the planet.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.280
So this right here is the crust.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.212
It is the outermost,
it's obviously solid.

00:01:08.212 --> 00:01:09.670
We'll think about
that when we talk

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.900
about the mechanical
side of things.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.140
And it's also the
thinnest layer.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.840
And crust is not uniform.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.080
There's both oceanic crust
and continental crust.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.830
And let me draw the crust
on this side as well.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.072
So let me draw some
crust over here.

00:01:25.072 --> 00:01:27.580
We've got some crust
right over there.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.800
And there is both oceanic
crust and continental crust.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.880
So oceanic crust
is thinner crust.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.700
So let's say this
part right here--

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.530
Let me draw some thicker
crust right over here.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.790
We'll call the thicker
stuff the continental crust,

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.737
which is thicker and less
dense than the oceanic crust.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:46.570
So what I'm doing in
this light green color,

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.690
this is continental.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.446
So this right here
is continental.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.380
And then in this kind of
more fluorescent green,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.305
this is oceanic crust.

00:01:59.305 --> 00:02:01.200
And the oceanic
crust is pretty thin.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.650
It's on the order of
about 5 or 10 kilometers.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:07.490
So let's just call this,
this is approximately 5 to 10

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.991
kilometers thick.

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:10.449
And when I talk
about oceanic crust

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:11.460
I'm not talking
about the oceans.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.120
I'm not talking about the
liquid part, the water.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.744
I'm talking about
the rock that kind of

00:02:14.744 --> 00:02:17.540
holds the water, the rock
underneath the oceans.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.720
And so this is 5 to
10 kilometers thick.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.210
If you were to go to
the bottom of the ocean

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.870
and you were to sit on the
rock and then drill you'd

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.810
have to drill about
5 to 10 kilometers

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.490
to get through that layer,
this compositional layer.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.280
So this is 5 to 10 kilometers.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.830
And the continental crust
is about 10 to 70 kilometers

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:35.330
thick.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.280
And obviously, they
are both rigid.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.620
They are both solid rock.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.790
Now below, when you
think about composition,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.040
or what the layers are made up
of, the next layer below that,

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.000
this is actually the biggest
layer of the earth by volume,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.735
is the mantle.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.949
Let me draw it like that.

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.990
I always have trouble
drawing the right-hand side

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.573
of the circle.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.970
So this is the mantle
right over here.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.797
This is all the mantle.

00:03:13.797 --> 00:03:15.880
And once again, we
differentiate it from the crust

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.379
because it's composed of
different types of rock.

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:21.920
Now, you go even deeper, and
let me give you the depths here.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.550
So the mantle starts
right below the crust,

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.750
right below the oceanic
and the continental crust.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.910
And it goes about 2,900
kilometers deeper.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.900
So it's much, much, much
thicker than the crust.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.100
The crust is on the order of 5
to maybe 70 kilometers thick.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.920
This is much, much thicker.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.940
So even though I've drawn
the crust fairly thin

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.830
I didn't draw it thin enough
relative to how thick I've

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:51.640
drawn the mantle.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.540
This isn't drawn to scale.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.860
Now, you go even
deeper than that you

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.420
get the densest
part of the earth.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.994
And that is the core.

00:04:01.994 --> 00:04:03.660
And there's going to
be couple of themes

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.243
here, especially when we think
about the mechanical properties

00:04:06.243 --> 00:04:10.630
of the earth, is the deeper you
get you're going to get denser

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.190
elements, and you're
going to have more heat

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.080
and more pressure.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.740
And the reason why you're
going to have denser elements

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.454
is when Earth was
first forming and it

00:04:17.454 --> 00:04:20.120
was kind of in this molten
state, the denser elements

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.780
just kind of sunk to the bottom,
and the lighter elements would

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.190
kind of rise to the top.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.350
They would have this
buoyancy because they're

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.090
less dense than
everything around it.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.180
And really even the gases
would kind of bubble up,

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.035
would essentially bubble
up and form our atmosphere.

00:04:35.035 --> 00:04:36.910
So that's why, in general,
the densest things

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.989
are in the center and
the least dense things

00:04:38.989 --> 00:04:39.780
are on the outside.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.570
They're in our atmosphere.

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.380
And the core, once
again, its composition

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.090
is fundamentally different
than the mantle and the crust.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.490
We believe that
it's mainly metals,

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.160
and in particular
iron and nickel.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.870
So that's the
structure of the layers

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.010
of the earth from a
composition point of view,

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.362
from a chemical point of view.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:58.320
Now, let's kind of think
about the same layers,

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.653
but we're going to think more
in terms of what's liquid,

00:05:00.653 --> 00:05:03.770
what's rigid and solid,
and what's in between.

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.590
So the outermost rigid
layer of the earth

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.090
is made up of the crust,
both the continental

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.930
and the oceanic crust, and
kind of the coolest top layer

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.680
of the mantle.

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.090
So let me draw that in pink.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.810
So this layer right over here.

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.052
So what I'm drawing in pink
is the cool, rigid, solid part

00:05:27.052 --> 00:05:27.635
of the mantle.

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.210
So it is solid rock, the part of
the mantle that is solid rock.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.070
It's composition is
different than say,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.190
the continental crust,
but they are both rigid.

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.310
So if you combine
this top-most layer

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.660
of the mantle with
the crust then you're

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.280
talking about the lithosphere.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.480
So this is the lithosphere.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.310
And this essentially gets
you about, the lithosphere,

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.280
depending on where you are on
the surface of the earth is

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.390
10 to 200 kilometers thick.

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:11.780
And most of the time it's closer
to the high end of this range.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.760
The 10 is kind of where you
have hot spots in the mantle

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.010
and it's essentially been
able to kind of dissolve

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:20.549
parts of the lithosphere.

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:22.090
Well, we'll talk
more about that when

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.657
we talk about the actual
plate tectonics of it all.

00:06:24.657 --> 00:06:26.240
And when we talk
about plate tectonics

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.030
the plates are actually
lithospheric plates.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.570
It's actually the
lithosphere that's

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:33.600
moving on top of the lower
layers of the mantle.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.080
So the lithosphere, it is rigid.

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.440
It is solid.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.480
It's made up of the crust
and the uppermost layer

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.380
of the mantle.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.890
Now, you go a little bit
deeper, the temperatures

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:47.160
and the pressures increase.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.200
But now the temperatures
have increased enough,

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.842
you have the same composition
as the uppermost, the rigid part

00:06:52.842 --> 00:06:54.300
of the mantle, but
the temperatures

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.270
have now gone up
enough that it now

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.807
turns into not quite a liquid.

00:06:58.807 --> 00:06:59.890
We won't call it a liquid.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.900
It actually still
transmits the type of waves

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.370
that liquids would not transmit.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:07.420
It's more of like a
putty type texture.

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:09.290
It has fluid properties.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.560
It can flow.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.170
It's way more
viscous than what we

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:14.630
would associate
with most fluids.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:16.410
So it's not rigid and solid.

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.460
It can have convection going on
in it, but it's not a liquid.

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.330
It still will transmit certain
types of waves that liquids

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:23.090
won't.

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:24.750
And this is called
the asthenosphere,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.130
kind of this jelly, putty layer.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.780
And it's like that
because it's so hot

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:33.060
that the rock has
somewhat melted.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.210
So this layer right here in
magenta is the asthenosphere.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.560
I've seen some spellings where
there's an "e" after the "a."

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.420
I think that's maybe
the European spelling.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.860
And the asthenosphere
obviously starts right

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:48.934
below the lithosphere.

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:50.600
It's what the
lithospheric plates-- when

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.080
we talk about plate tectonics--
are riding on top of.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.690
It's kind of the
gummy material that

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.590
allows it to actually move,
that allows the rigid layer

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.930
to actually move on top.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.860
So it starts below
the lithosphere,

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:06.200
and it ends at around
660 kilometers deep.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:11.960
So this right here is
660 kilometers deep.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.910
And then you go even
deeper than that,

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:16.580
and now the pressures
are so big that even

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.990
though the temperatures
are even higher

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:24.560
the pressures are so big
that the same material can't

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.170
have fluid motion anymore.

00:08:26.170 --> 00:08:27.930
It's essentially
been jammed together.

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:33.340
So you can imagine if you have
things that are somewhat fluid,

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.900
that means that the
molecules can kind of slide

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.480
past each other,
maybe very slowly.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:42.450
But if you increase
the pressure enough

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.867
they'll be jammed
into each other.

00:08:43.867 --> 00:08:45.324
And that's essentially
what happens

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:46.660
in the next layer of the mantle.

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:47.860
All of these layers
of the mantle

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:49.140
are made up of the same thing.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.680
It's just difference of
temperature and pressure.

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.180
And so that next
layer of the mantle

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:54.221
is called the mesosphere.

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.840
This is called the
mesosphere, but there's also

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:06.050
a layer of our atmosphere,
the layer right

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.220
above the stratosphere
that's called the mesosphere,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.780
and so don't get confused here.

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.570
These are two
different mesospheres.

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.980
And this layer, the
pressure is so big

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:15.840
that now we are rigid again.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.380
We are kind of definitely solid.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.040
None of this debate
about a little bit

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.650
of fluid motion because
the pressures are so big.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.310
Now, you go a little
bit deeper, we are now

00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:30.500
in the core, the metallic
core, and the temperatures are

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.380
so high that even though the
pressures are high, because we

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.190
have a compositional
change, we're

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:40.030
at pressures where this type
of mesospheric rock is rigid,

00:09:40.030 --> 00:09:44.730
but metals at these temperatures
actually can be fluid,

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.870
can actually be liquid.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:51.680
And so we actually have
a liquid outer core.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:57.900
The entire core,
as far as we know,

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.260
is made up of the same stuff.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.840
Just the outer part of
the core, the temperatures

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.550
are high enough
to melt the metal,

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:07.210
but the pressures aren't so
high enough to make them solid.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.560
The pressures are
definitely high enough

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.018
to make kind of
more rocky material

00:10:10.018 --> 00:10:11.690
solid, but not the metals.

00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.350
And then you go even deeper,
now even though the temperature

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:16.760
keeps going up, the
pressure is so strong

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.800
that even the metals are solid.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.229
So this is the solid inner core.

00:10:23.229 --> 00:10:25.270
So when you think about
the mechanical properties

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.950
the innermost-- And just so
you know the total distances

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:32.720
we're talking about, the outer
core starts at-- Actually I

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:34.740
didn't tell you where
the mesosphere--

00:10:34.740 --> 00:10:40.240
So the mantle ends at about
2,900 kilometers deep.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.780
So that's clearly where the
mesosphere ends as well,

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.250
because the mesosphere is
kind of the lower mantle.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:49.760
So this is 2,900
kilometers deep.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.660
Then you go even deeper, you're
in the liquid outer core.

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:55.290
And that extends from
about 2,900 kilometers

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:59.120
deep to about 5,100
kilometers deep.

00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.290
So I frankly should
make the liquid core

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:04.300
in my drawing even wider.

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:10.562
So this depth right over here
is about 5,100 kilometers deep.

00:11:10.562 --> 00:11:13.020
And then, obviously, then you
have the center of the earth,

00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:14.930
and the entire
radius of the earth

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.560
is about 6,400 kilometers.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:20.200
So hopefully that
clarifies things

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.630
when you hear people talking
about the lithosphere,

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:23.770
or the mantle.

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:26.370
They're really talking about
mechanical versus composition.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.890
When we talk about
mechanical solid inner core,

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.920
liquid outer core,
essentially solid mesosphere.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.710
It's rigid.

00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:37.810
Then you have something kind of
a spongy, somewhat fluid, not

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:40.930
solid, not liquid asthenosphere
that the lithospheric plates

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.030
can ride on top of.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:44.610
And then you have your actual
rigid, solid lithosphere

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:49.263
made up of the uppermost part
of the mantle and the crust.
