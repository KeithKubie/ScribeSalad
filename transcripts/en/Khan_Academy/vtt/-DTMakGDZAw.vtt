00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's have a little bit of a review of what
a function is before we talk about what

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:03.919
it means that

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.870
what the domain of a function means.
So function we can view as

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.219
something -- so I put a function in this box
here and it takes

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.019
inputs, and for a given input, it's going to
produce an output which we call

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.740
f of x. So, for example, let's say that
we have the function --

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.949
let's say we have the function f of x

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.439
is equal to 2 over

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.810
x. So in this case if -- let me see --

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.579
that's my function f. If I were to input

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.090
the number 3. Well, f of 3

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.100
that we're going to output -- we have, we
know how to figure that out. We've

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.910
defined it right over here. It's going to be
equal to 2

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.940
over 3. It's going to be equal to 2

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.100
over 3. So we're able, for that input, we're
able to find an output.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.629
If our input was pi, then

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.030
we input into our function and then
f of pi --

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.090
when x is pi, we're going to output
f of pi,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.629
which is equal to 2 over pi. So we
could write this as 2

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.630
over pi. We're able to find the output
pretty easily. But I want to do something

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.310
interesting. Let's attempt to input 0

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.380
into the function. If we input 0 then
the function

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.030
tells us what we need to output. Does this
definition tell us what we need to output?

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.939
So if I attempt to put x equal 0, then this
definition would say

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.150
f of 0 be 2 over 0, but 2 over 0 is
undefined.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.159
Rewrite this -- 2 over 0. This is undefined.
This function definition does not tell us

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.729
what to actually do with 0. It gives us an
undefined answer.

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.060
So this function is not defined here.
It gives a question mark.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.290
So this gets to the essence of what domain is.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.119
Domain is the set of all inputs over
which the function

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.579
is defined. So the domain of this
function f would be all real numbers

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.060
except for x equals 0.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.939
So we write down these, these big ideas.
This is

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.170
the domain -- the domain of a function --

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.020
Actually let me write that out. The domain of a function

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.130
A domain of a function

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.500
is the set of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.510
all inputs -- inputs

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.130
over which the function is defined -- over

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:30.370
which the function is defined,
or the function has defined outputs

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.810
over which the function has defined

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.840
outputs. So the domain for this f
in particular --

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.910
so the domain for this one  -- if I want
to say

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.770
its domain, I could say, look, it's going to
be the set of these curly brackets. These are

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.820
kind of typical mathy set notation. I said OK
, it could be the set of -- I gonna put

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.920
curly brackets like that. Well, x can be a
member

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.460
So this little symbol means a
member of the real numbers. But it can't be

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.620
any real number. It could be

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.720
most of the real numbers except it
cannot be 0 because we don't know

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.840
-- this definition is undefined when
you put the input as 0

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.400
So x is a member of the real numbers,
and we write real numbers -- we write it

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.400
with this kind of double stroke right over here.
That's the set of all real numbers

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.950
such that -- we have to put
the exception. 0 is not a --

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.770
x equals to 0 is not a member of that
domain -- such that x

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.020
does not -- does not equal

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.610
0. Now let's make this a little bit
more concrete by do some more examples

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.160
So more examples we do,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.950
hopefully the clearer this will become.
So let's say we have another function.

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.830
Just be clear, we don't
always have to use f's

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.110
and x's. We could say, let's say we
have g

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.440
of y is equal to the square root

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.530
of y minus

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.820
6. So what is the domain here? What is the set

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:59.450
of all inputs over which this function g
is defined? So here

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.680
we are in putting a y it to function g

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.300
and we're gonna output

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.490
g of y. Well it's going to be defined
as long as whatever we have under the

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:10.730
radical right over here

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.080
is non-negative. If this becomes a
negative, our traditional principal

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.280
root operator here

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:19.690
is not defined. We need something that --
if this was a negative

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.140
number, how would you take the principal
root of a negative number?

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.610
We just think this is kind of the the
traditional principal root operator.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.270
So y minus 6, y minus 6 needs to be greater than

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.310
or equal to 0, in order for, in order for g
to be defined for that input y.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.490
Or you could say add six to both sides.
y is to be greater than or equal 6.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:45.150
Or you could say g is defined for any inputs
y that are greater than or equal to 6.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.470
So you could say the domain here, we
could say the domain here

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.850
is the set of all y's that are members of
the real numbers

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:58.690
such that y, such that they're also
greater than

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:01.980
or equal, such that they're also

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.990
greater than or equal to 6. So hopefully
this is starting to make some sense --

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.750
You're all used to a function that is
defined this way. You could even see

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:10.930
functions that are divided

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.650
fairly exotic ways. You could see a
function -- let me say h of x --

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.470
h of x could be defined as -- it literally
could be defined as, well h of x is gonna be 1

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.280
if x is equal to pi

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.950
and it's equal to 0 if, if,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.550
x is equal to 3. Now what's the domain
here? And I encourage you to pause the video and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:33.360
think about it.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.500
Well, this function is actually only
defined for two input. If you,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.250
we know h of -- we know h of pi --
if you input pi into it

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:45.860
we know you're gonna output 1, and
we know that if you input 3 into it

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.200
h of 3, when x equals 3, you're going to
-- you're going to --

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.440
put some commas here. You're gonna get 0.
But if you input anything else, what's

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.710
h of 4 going to be?

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:00.020
Well, it hasn't defined. It's undefined.
What's h of negative 1 going to be?

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.289
It hasn't defined. So the domain, the domain here,

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.750
the domain of h

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.490
is literally -- it's just literally
going to be the the two valid inputs

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.629
that x can be

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:15.740
are 3 and pi.

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.569
These are the only valid inputs.
These are the only two numbers over

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:25.139
which this function is actually defined.
So this hopefully starts to give you a flavor

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.150
of why we care about to the domain.
It's not all functions are defined over

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.330
all real numbers. Some are defined 
for only a small subset

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:36.720
of real numbers, or for some other
thing, or only whole numbers, or natural

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.520
numbers, or positive numbers, and negative
numbers. So they have exceptions.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.590
So we'll see that as we do
more and more examples.
