Some genres we watch because we expect a certain
amount of reality.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.809
Historical dramas, biopics, and crime films
often draw heavily from real life events,

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.990
but when we go see a horror, comedy or action
film, we go to escape reality.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.619
Yet you’d be surprised how often these seemingly
outlandish or unlikely films are inspired

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:24.829
by actual events.&nbsp;

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:30.329
Here Are 10 Movies You Didn’t Know Are Based
On True Stories

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:34.450
Indiana Jones
Spielberg didn’t choose Nazis for the baddies

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.520
in the Indiana Jones just because they’re
so easy to villainize.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.800
Hitler was indeed obsessed with finding ancient
religious artifacts and spent a vast amount

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.610
of time and resources attempting to track
down relics like the Ark of the Covenant and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.239
the Holy Grail.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.059
Inspiration for the Indiana Jones character
has been accredited to several American archeologists

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.720
of the period, but another frequently cited
inspiration is explorer Roy Chapman Andrews.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.579
Often photographed wearing an Indy-esqu fedora,
the globetrotting Andrews eventually became

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.970
the director of the American Museum of Natural
History.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.510
Jaws
Just when you thought it was safe to go back

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.230
into the water, you watched a Screen Rant
video that told you that the attacks in Jaws

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.440
were eerily similar to a series of shark attacks
that rocked the resort town of Beach Haven

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.650
in the summer of 1916.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.940
Novelist Peter Benchley updated these events
and based the Captain Quint character on Frank

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.060
Mundus, a shark fisherman who he spent some
time with while researching his book.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.640
Mundus never met his demise at the jaws of
a great white, but actor Robert Shaw says

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.140
much of his memorable performance was indeed
based on the real life shark hunter.&nbsp;

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.690
The Exorcist&nbsp;
William Peter Blatty, author of The Exorcist,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.280
didn’t just contrive this horror story out
of thin air.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.470
There have been reports of demonic possessions
for centuries, but there was one in particular

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.850
that inspired the story of young Regan.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.140
Blatty cites the 1949 exorcism of a 14 year
old boy in Maryland known only as "Roland

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.140
Doe".

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.460
Similarities between this case and the events
depicted in the film include levitating furniture,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:11.000
violent outbursts, speaking in tongues and
an aversion to sacred objects.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.860
After Roman Catholic Priests performed several
exorcisms, and sustained injuries from the

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.420
boy while doing so, Roland went on to live
a relatively normal life.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.220
Goodfellas&nbsp;
Martin Scorsese’s 1990 film GoodFellas helped

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.640
define the modern gangster genre with its
dynamic structure and bursts of violence.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.150
The characters portrayed by Ray Liotta, Robert
DeNiro and Joe Peci are so larger than life

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.000
that it’s hard to believe they were based
on real people.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.340
Once gangster Henry Hill rolled on all his
friends and entered the witness protection

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.940
program, all bets were off and he filled in
writer Nicholas Pileggi with all the colorful

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:45.940
details.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.750
Pileggi wrote the book that would become the
basis for Scorsese’s film.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.780
If you want to know how accurate GoodFellas
was, you can listen to the DVD commentary

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.350
Henry Hill recorded on it before passing away
in 2012.&nbsp;

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.980
Silence Of The Lambs
For the serial killer Buffalo Bill in Silence

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.400
of the Lambs, writer Thomas Harris needed
look no further than notorious killer Ed Gein

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.820
for inspiration.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.680
The things authorities discovered in Gein’s
home after arresting him were stranger than

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.209
anything a sane person could come up with.

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.100
They found furniture, silverware, and even
clothing made of human skin and body parts.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.570
Like Buffalo Bill, he was stitching together
a suit of woman’s skin, some psychiatrists

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:28.100
thought this was so he could pretend to be
his mother.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.790
Gein was also the inspiration for Norman Bates
in Psycho and Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.700
Massacre.&nbsp;

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.760
Catch Me If You Can
How many people can claim to have been a lawyer,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.930
a doctor, an airline pilot AND had Leonardo
DiCaprio play them in a movie?

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.370
Notorious forger and impostor Frank Abagnale
was never actually a lawyer, doctor, or pilot,

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.910
but Leo did play him in a 2002 film about
his exploits called Catch Me If You Can.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.040
Abagnale assumed no less than eight different
identities which he used to pull scams all

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.610
over the world until he was caught in France.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.849
At the time of his arrest he was only 21,
by 26 Abagnale was out of prison and working

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:07.270
to prevent the kinds of crimes he’d become
so good at.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.750
His escapades as documented in the film and
book it was based on are so fanciful that

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.370
many still doubt their legitimacy.&nbsp;

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:19.810
The Sound of Music
If you trace back the many iterations of the

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.719
classic film The Sound of Music, you’ll
arrive at a memoir called The Story of the

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:27.499
Trapp Family Singers written by Maria Augusta
von Trapp.

00:04:27.499 --> 00:04:31.870
The events surrounding her family fleeing
Nazi occupied Austria are not an obvious choice

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.340
for a family friendly musical so the film
took many liberties with Maria’s story.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.379
They decided to concentrate on the love story
between the children’s nanny and their father,

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:44.219
even though that took place over a decade
before the Nazi’s rise to power.

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:48.029
And while they were a musical family, they
did not break into spontaneous song and dance

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.599
nearly as often as the film would have you
believe.&nbsp;

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:56.389
Almost Famous&nbsp;
Getting a gig writing for Rolling Stone and

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.729
going on the road with one of your favourite
bands sounds like every 1970s high schooler’s

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:01.729
fantasy.

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.759
But that’s exactly what future writer/ director
Cameron Crowe did when he lied about his age

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:08.960
to land a dream assignment with his favourite
magazine.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.430
Almost Famous is the film that came out of
Crowe’s experiences travelling with bands

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.419
like Led Zeppelin, the Eagles, and Lynyrd
Skynyrd.

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.949
Much of this semi autobiographical film is
fictionalized, but losing his virginity, falling

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.949
in love and meeting his heroes were all things
that happened to Crowe during his time spent

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.699
on the road as an underage Rolling Stone journalist.&nbsp;

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.270
A Few Good Men&nbsp;
A Few Good Men began as a play written by

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.379
a then unknown writer named Aaron Sorkin who
got the idea from his sister.

00:05:37.379 --> 00:05:41.080
She was a lawyer working with the Navy and
was going to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.999
to defend a group of Marines who almost killed
a fellow Marine in a hazing ordered by a superior

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:47.669
officer.

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.520
Yes, sadly “Code Red” is a real order.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.419
The marines were acquitted but the film omitted
the fact that one of them was later murdered.

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:01.819
Apparently Sorkin thought audiences just couldn’t
handle the truth.&nbsp;

00:06:01.819 --> 00:06:06.119
Star Wars&nbsp;
From gunslingers to nazis, the parallels between

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:10.169
Star Wars and Western history have been well
documented, but you should know that Lucas

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:14.580
also took a number of ideas from Eastern history,
particularly feudal Japan.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.319
Take the Jedi, noble warriors who were basically
Samurai in space.&nbsp;

00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:22.569
Both chosen from birth and trained their entire
lives to be thoughtful yet deadly peacekeepers,

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:26.110
the Jedi and Samurai even dress in a similar
manner.

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:32.050
Despite being powerful, their purpose is to
serve those in need of their services and

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.539
respect peace and order.

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.240
More overt references came in the form of
the Jedi’s weapon of choice and Vader’s

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.059
helmet, which resembles a Japanese Kabuto
helmet.

00:06:40.059 --> 00:06:43.830
The Samurai were eventually replaced by a
more westernized military, and the knights

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.550
of old became the stuff of legends.&nbsp;

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:47.550
So there you have it.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:51.379
If nothing else, this list proves that the
line between fact and fiction is easily blurred

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.270
once you get a couple creative people telling
the story.&nbsp;

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:56.960
What are some films you didn’t realize were
based on true stories?
