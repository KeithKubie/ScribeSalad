00:00:05.956 --> 00:00:07.580
CHARLOTTE RELYEA:
I'm Charlotte Relyea.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:11.540
As Tara said, I lead our
Women's Initiative at McKinsey.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.790
And this is a topic that's
near and dear to my heart.

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:18.590
And I assume a pretty timely
topic right now for all of you.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.510
I'm going to share
some of our insights

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.220
from our Women in the
Workplace research

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.370
that we do together
with Lean In.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.940
And we're in our
second year of doing

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.850
a survey of approximately--
about 130 companies

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.450
have participated, about
34,000 participants.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.510
And those companies
represent about almost five,

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.150
or 4 and 1/2 million employees.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.370
So a lot of great
insights that we've been

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.602
able to get out of the data.

00:00:42.602 --> 00:00:44.060
And as I mentioned,
this is a topic

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.180
that's really near
and dear to my heart.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.250
So in addition to spending a
lot of time on women's issues

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.540
at McKinsey, I'm a mother.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.746
I have a daughter.

00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:53.120
And you know, I'm
always thinking

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.550
about how is this world
going to be different

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.887
when she is in the
workplace and how can we

00:00:57.887 --> 00:00:58.970
make that happen together?

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.850
So before I get
into the research,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.970
I wanted to lay a little bit
of the groundwork for why

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.760
this is a topic that
people should care about.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.790
Other than a lot of the obvious
reasons, the economic case

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.970
is real.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.770
So we did research, in our
power of parity research,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.722
where we looked at different
regions across the globe

00:01:20.722 --> 00:01:22.180
and estimated what
the impact would

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.100
be if women achieved parity.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.750
And that's impact of about $28
trillion, if we close the gap.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.660
You know, recognizing that's
slightly unreasonable,

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.180
we also said, well, what if
each company within its region--

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.980
sorry, each country,
within its region,

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.700
were able to reach parity
or the pace of change

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.440
of the fastest changing
countries in the region?

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.590
And that has an impact
about $12 trillion.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.620
So this is a huge number,
obviously, and something

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.230
that we all need to care about.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.290
In the US, this impact
is about $2.1 trillion.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.350
So this is bigger
than the GDP of Texas.

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.060
And there's three main gaps to
close in order to get parity.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.980
One is participation.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.000
So in the US, it's about 40%
of the gap is participation.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.360
30% from moving people from
part-time to full-time,

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.550
and then 30%
productivity, and that's

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.690
essentially people in lower
wage or lower productive jobs

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.910
or sectors and with pay gaps.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.680
So if those things close,
we would see $2.1 trillion.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.880
So at the company level,
what's the case for change?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.800
We typically look at
it in four lenses.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.900
So one is the more obvious,
most obvious one, values, right?

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.670
A second one is around talent.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.670
Third is performance, there's
an actual link to performance

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.139
and gender diversity.

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.555
And finally, the
customer-- how do

00:02:45.555 --> 00:02:47.180
we actually relate
more to our customer

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.977
base that's making decisions?

00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:51.310
Primarily, there are a lot
of women making the decisions

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.520
in the household.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.540
So first, if you
think about values,

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.000
women make up a huge portion
of the workplace, right?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.920
But if you look at their pay
gap, women are making about 20%

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:08.970
less than men.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.620
And furthermore,
there's actually

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.730
a differential in what
happens when there's positive

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.300
versus negative performance.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.180
So in times of
positive performance,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.600
women tend to get less of
a bump and share in less

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.210
of the upside, and actually
get penalized more when

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.800
there's negative performance.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.470
So the meritocracy,
while it's important

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.850
and it's something that we all
talk about, it's not there yet.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.000
Talent-- so winning the war
for talent, needless to say,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.980
means getting more women.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.310
Today, college graduates, women
that are college graduates,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.970
represent 58% of the
college graduate population.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.960
And so if you want
to get talent,

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.010
you need to get women both
right out of college, but also

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.270
at every stage in the pipeline.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.640
Performance-- there
have been many studies.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.950
I know you've done
a lot of studies

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.440
at Google on the
power of diverse teams

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.664
and diversity of thought.

00:04:04.664 --> 00:04:06.080
The research that
we've done shows

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.100
that gender diverse
companies outperform by 15%,

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.980
and ethnically diverse
companies outperform by 35%.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.029
So there's a real case for
performance in diversity.

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:21.255
And finally, the
customer-- so women

00:04:21.255 --> 00:04:23.380
are making a lot of the
decisions in the household.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.810
This is obviously
in the BBC world.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.610
But if you think
about that, actually

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.910
having a diverse organization
that's serving those households

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.720
is quite important.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.610
So now, let's turn to the women
in the workplace research.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.880
For starters, we've
been benchmarking

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.530
this for about 10 years.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.030
We've been benchmarking
and studying

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:44.988
women in the workplace,
the pipeline, the data,

00:04:44.988 --> 00:04:46.780
for about 10 years.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.280
Over the past few
years, we've also

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.730
started expanding
to also benchmark

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.411
and look at the experiences
and attitudes of men and women

00:04:54.411 --> 00:04:54.910
as well.

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.322
So we'll get into that.

00:04:56.322 --> 00:04:58.030
But when you look at
the trends, the data

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.010
trends of the
pipeline, it's going

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.920
to take-- given the
glacial pace at which we're

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.010
moving-- it's going to take
about 100 years to reach gender

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:08.624
parity in the
C-suite, 100 years.

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:11.290
So I'm personally hoping that we
can speed that up a little bit.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.450
Because I'd like
my daughter to be

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.130
able to have a
better chance and not

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.960
have to wait till my
great-granddaughter

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.930
to see parity.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.020
So what does the corporate
pipeline look like?

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.470
And this is US data by the way.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.790
But when we look at the European
data, it's relatively similar.

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.910
The corporate pipeline
is not looking great.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.650
So our results from
this year reaffirm

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:33.590
what we keep seeing, what we've
seen over the past 10 years.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.880
Which is women are represented
at every level in the pipeline,

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:38.870
in the organization.

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.739
And the numbers aren't
changing much year after year.

00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:43.280
We're going to come
back to this one.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.290
But despite a misperception,
this is not due to attrition,

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.790
right?

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.470
This is actually
due to promotion

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.760
and some other factors.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.080
So we'll come back to that.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.930
If you look at women of
color, it's even worse, right?

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.400
It's even more stark.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.074
So at the C-suite, instead of
17%, you see 3%, for example.

00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:02.240
And if you look at some of
"The Wall Street Journal"

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.390
research on the ambition
of women of color,

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.910
black, Hispanic and
Asian women are--

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.810
48% of them said they aspire
to be a top executive, compared

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.410
with 37% of white women.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.170
So there's not a
lack of ambition

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.890
on the part of women of color.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:21.510
So now going back to attrition,
it is not the driving factor.

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:23.370
And this is a very
common misperception,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.740
and clearly, this is a
myth busting piece of data.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:29.970
But if you look at-- this
is attrition by tenure.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.165
And men actually attrite
faster than women.

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:34.290
Which means it's not that
women are leaving, right?

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.050
And often, look, the
one caveat to this

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.510
is, this doesn't necessarily
say where the men are going.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.170
So they might actually be going
into another position, similar,

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:44.460
to another organization.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.740
But still, if you
look at this, it's

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.524
not saying that the
reason why we're

00:06:49.524 --> 00:06:50.940
losing women at
more senior levels

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.065
is because they're leaving.

00:06:55.954 --> 00:06:57.370
So let's talk about
the challenge.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.810
The challenge starts early,
at the very first milestone.

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.460
For every 100 women
promoted, about 130 men

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.034
are promoted at the
first promotion.

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:11.200
So this is from the entry
level position to manager,

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.430
for example.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:15.310
And then we also see
discrepancy in hiring

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.930
throughout the pipeline.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:19.040
So what that means is it
just keeps getting worse.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.020
So not only are we promoting men
at a faster rate at the earlier

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.210
stages, but we're also
bringing in more men

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.190
throughout the funnel.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.095
And furthermore, we're promoting
women at a slower rate.

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:31.720
So all of these things
are contributing

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.738
to the state of the pipeline.

00:07:36.826 --> 00:07:39.200
So now let's turn for a moment
to the second part of what

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.780
I had originally mentioned,
which is not just the pipeline

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.722
data, but the experience data.

00:07:44.722 --> 00:07:47.180
So what are the attitudes of
men and women in the workplace

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.820
and how does that
explain some of the data?

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.070
I want to start by getting
a little bit of involvement

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:55.410
from you in the room.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:07:57.750
So first question,
raise your hand if yes,

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.210
has your gender been a
disadvantage as you've

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.060
climbed the corporate ladder?

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.870
Yes, it has.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.080
Raise your hand if it's yes.

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.340
First of all, it's
great that a lot of you

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:10.400
have not had that issue.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:13.030
But I do see, if I look
around the room, probably

00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:17.370
more women raising
their hands, which

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.000
is consistent with the data.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.030
So if you look at
the data, women

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.790
perceive more disadvantages
based on their gender,

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:27.840
and the gap keeps getting
wider as you go more senior.

00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.450
And when we look at the
actual qualitative data

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.610
behind the survey,
women consistently

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:35.549
report feeling that their
contributions are often

00:08:35.549 --> 00:08:37.710
valued less than
men, that they're

00:08:37.710 --> 00:08:41.880
being turned to less than
men for important decisions,

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.730
that they're participating
less meaningfully in meetings,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.640
and often they're receiving
fewer challenging assignments

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.481
than men.

00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:49.980
Other research that
we've done often

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:52.080
shows that men get
stretch assignments

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.707
and are promoted
based on potential,

00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:55.290
whereas often women
are promoted based

00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.450
on performance and the
history of their performance.

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.929
And one other factoid on
millennials, which is,

00:09:00.929 --> 00:09:02.970
you'd hope that this is
changing for millennials.

00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.595
But actually,
millennials have answered

00:09:04.595 --> 00:09:07.290
these questions in
very similar ways

00:09:07.290 --> 00:09:08.928
to the rest of the workforce.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.870
So another question--
raise your hand if yes.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.320
Do you have meaningful
access to senior leadership?

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.020
Yes?

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:23.790
OK, all right, better, better.

00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:26.910
So men and women also report
having different access

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:29.760
to senior leaders and networks.

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.340
So this is also another
case where the gap grows.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.860
And particularly at
more senior levels

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.870
where access to
senior leadership

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:40.260
is especially important for
sponsorship and for promotion,

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.154
it gets worse.

00:09:41.154 --> 00:09:42.570
And one of the
reasons behind this

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.370
also has to do with networks.

00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:47.940
So women tend to have
networks, our research shows,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.800
that are 50/50, women, men.

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.390
And then men tend
to have networks

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:53.700
that are primarily male.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:56.310
So if you then think
about, within my network,

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:59.510
just if you do the math,
it has to be true, right,

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:01.987
that women just have smaller
networks if that's the case.

00:10:01.987 --> 00:10:03.570
Because we know that
there are so many

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:05.640
more men in senior
ranks, or they

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.875
have smaller networks
of senior leaders.

00:10:07.875 --> 00:10:09.000
And so what does that mean?

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.220
Obviously, we need to get more
women in senior positions.

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:17.239
But we also need to make sure
that men are mentoring women.

00:10:17.239 --> 00:10:19.530
That's a big, big gap, and
we'll come back to that one.

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:22.080
But often people tend
to mentor others that

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.210
are very similar to themselves.

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:25.950
They don't feel as
comfortable, men

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:28.320
might not feel comfortable
taking a woman out to drinks,

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.660
if that's the way the
mentorship relationship begins,

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:31.535
and things like that.

00:10:31.535 --> 00:10:33.900
So how do you actually
start becoming very--

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.310
and this is a call to action
for the men in the room--

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.820
how can you get
really purposeful

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.739
about thinking about who you
want to mentor and sponsor

00:10:41.739 --> 00:10:42.780
within your organization?

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.113
Which women you're going to
really take under your wing?

00:10:45.113 --> 00:10:48.570
Because that makes
a huge difference.

00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:51.590
So how about this, do you
feel that you've received

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.952
as much feedback as your peers?

00:10:53.952 --> 00:10:54.910
Raise your hand if yes.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.560
OK, a little bit of a
mix, a little of a mix.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:06.330
So our research shows that women
receive less feedback than men,

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:11.580
and more specifically, the
tough developmental messages.

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.410
OK, so what does that mean?

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:15.000
Especially as you
get more senior,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
hearing the tough messages
that help you develop

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.960
is extremely important to
developing and progressing.

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.620
And not only men,
but women actually

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:31.260
have a harder time telling the
hard messages to other women.

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.260
So both men and women
worry that they're

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:36.330
going to create an
emotional response

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:39.960
or that they are going to be
perceived as mean or hurtful.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.840
I mean, this goes back to a
lot with unconscious bias,

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.624
but by giving a woman feedback.

00:11:44.624 --> 00:11:46.290
And if you think about
that, then that's

00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:49.710
doing a tremendous disservice,
tremendous disservice.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:53.460
Because we know that people grow
through developmental feedback.

00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:56.320
And so how can we all ask
ourselves, are we doing that?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:56.820
Right?

00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:59.340
Are you giving the hard
but important messages

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.400
to women in the same way
that you're giving to men?

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.700
And if you're not, how might
you shift your mindset to say,

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.730
you know, my intention is
to help this person grow.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:11.710
And so being mean or
hurtful is not the issue.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.790
It's about using the
intention, a positive intent.

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.390
So have you ever been called
aggressive, intimidating,

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.160
demanding, or bossy?

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.550
OK.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.550
This is a great culture.

00:12:31.229 --> 00:12:31.770
I'm with you.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.730
I'm raising my hand,
too, by the way.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.040
So the good news--

00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.900
we looked at this from
the following angle.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.620
We said, how many people are
more likely to negotiate?

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:47.622
Whether it's for higher pay or
a promotion or something else--

00:12:47.622 --> 00:12:48.830
are you willing to negotiate?

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.360
And the good news
is that women are

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.360
negotiating at the same rate
as men, so we're doing it.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.580
But the bad news is that women
get unduly penalized, right,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.770
for being bossy and aggressive.

00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:07.100
So what that means is that the
percentage of women and men

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:10.790
that were called bossy,
aggressive, or intimidating

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:15.050
is much higher for the women
that negotiated versus the men.

00:13:15.050 --> 00:13:18.710
And by the way, 19% of
the women who didn't even

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:21.110
say they negotiated feel
like they're being called

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.630
those things a lot of the time.

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.570
So how do we change the game?

00:13:26.570 --> 00:13:28.310
Let's talk about
changing the game.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:31.260
Three things we've seen in
companies that are the best.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:35.750
And so first of all, I'm
going to start by saying,

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:39.280
as we saw in the data, we are
far from where we need to be.

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.690
And no one company
has cracked the code.

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:43.820
So there's nobody
that's figured it out

00:13:43.820 --> 00:13:45.126
and doing it tremendously well.

00:13:45.126 --> 00:13:47.000
Lots of companies are
trying different things

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.940
and having success
in different ways.

00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:51.779
But nobody has cracked the code.

00:13:51.779 --> 00:13:53.570
But we looked at some
of the companies that

00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:55.964
had over 30% women in
the C-suite, right?

00:13:55.964 --> 00:13:58.130
So those that were doing
the best on this dimension.

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:00.590
And we said, what are some of
the things that are common?

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.210
So three things, and we'll
dive into them in a minute.

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:06.020
So one is persistence.

00:14:06.020 --> 00:14:08.660
Many of these companies,
including McKinsey,

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:12.140
have been at this
for 10 years or more.

00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.640
We've been talking about it.

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.080
We've been looking at the data.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:17.180
We've been trying
different things.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.810
And it takes time.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:20.960
It takes time and commitment.

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.760
The second one is
the CEO commitment.

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.030
So this is not a
social, you know,

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:28.010
nice to have thing on the side.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.792
This is a true
priority from the CEO,

00:14:29.792 --> 00:14:32.000
and this is commitment that
cascades all the way down

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.090
the organization in the way that
any business initiative would.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.130
That's number two.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.380
And then number three is
holistic change programs.

00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:42.180
So again, it's not about a
bunch of policies or programs

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:42.680
on the side.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.870
But it's the holistic
change programs

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.420
that engage people throughout
the organization that

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.250
include all the
metrics in the data

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.730
and monitoring, the way you'd
run any major holistic change

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:53.840
transformation.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.240
All of those elements are true.

00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.170
So let's dive into that
last one for a moment.

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.730
The first part of that is
really making a compelling case

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:07.230
for diversity.

00:15:07.230 --> 00:15:08.940
It's not just about saying it.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.930
So if you look at this,
right, almost 80% of companies

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:15.630
claim the gender
diversity is a priority.

00:15:15.630 --> 00:15:19.680
But the employees
don't really buy it.

00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:24.540
So this is the
percentage of people

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.280
that say my manager,
or sales leaders,

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.380
or senior leaders, or my CEO
consider this a priority.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.170
They don't buy that
companies are actually

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:32.340
make it a priority.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:33.570
And why is that?

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:36.470
Well, we looked at some
of these organizations.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.910
And even companies that look
great on paper-- they've

00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:41.220
got amazing policies,
they've got work from home,

00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:44.580
they've got flexible work style,
they've got parental leave,

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:48.750
they have lots of community
events and efforts.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:50.760
But if they're not
walking the walk,

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.490
if it's not clear
to the organization

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:56.540
that it's actually OK to take
advantage of those programs,

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.036
and that it's championed that
you're part of those things,

00:15:59.036 --> 00:15:59.910
people don't do them.

00:15:59.910 --> 00:16:00.530
They might exist.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.470
People don't do them.

00:16:01.470 --> 00:16:03.780
They think, you know,
going on a longer maternity

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:06.620
leave is a kiss of death.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:12.460
It's my walk down the path
of the downward cycle.

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:19.790
So companies also, therefore,
need to be talking about it,

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:20.290
right?

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.456
There's lots of companies
that are talking about it.

00:16:22.456 --> 00:16:23.770
I think you're probably--

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.980
you are all talking
about it a lot right now.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:27.810
We can continue
to talk about it.

00:16:27.810 --> 00:16:31.740
But the CEOs need
to be very clear

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.250
that this is a
priority, that there

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.180
is a business case behind it,
that we're making it happen.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.090
And so here's just a couple
of examples of organizations

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:41.460
like P&amp;G and JP Morgan that
are really putting muscle

00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.590
behind making this a
priority for the organization

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:46.830
and talking about it a lot.

00:16:46.830 --> 00:16:51.010
So secondly, this is about
policy, right, and procedure,

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:56.470
the way in which you do
hiring, reviews, promotions,

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.110
making sure that there's
real equity there.

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:01.510
There's real gender
discrepancies

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:04.660
in how people perceive
fairness at work.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.880
So people really feel that
it is not quite as fair

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.550
as the companies
say it is, right?

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:17.440
And particularly women
feel that promotions

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.390
and getting opportunities,
they are at a disadvantage.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:24.760
We've talked about that
before within the data.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.390
But how do you act
to change that?

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:29.770
So there are a
few things, right,

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:31.600
if you look at just
how do you do it

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:35.560
in the different stages of
talent management, so hiring,

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.720
reviews, and promotions.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.390
A big thing,
particularly when hiring,

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.040
but also within
reviews and promotions,

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.270
is unconscious bias.

00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:47.260
So how do you really
figure out ways

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:48.670
to remove unconscious bias?

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:54.280
There's organizations that are
doing blind resume screening,

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.610
that are bringing in new
games and ways of applying

00:17:57.610 --> 00:18:03.760
to the organization
that don't require

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.020
seeing somebody face to face.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:06.580
But it's rather
looking at their work

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.470
or looking at or
listening to their music

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:11.065
or what have you before there's
a face to face interaction

00:18:11.065 --> 00:18:12.730
so there's absolutely no bias.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:14.200
And those
organizations that have

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.510
done that type of blind
screening actually

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:22.240
find much more parity in
their hiring practices.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.460
You know, VMware, for example,
this is in the reviews,

00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.770
they actually train
managers right

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:35.520
before they would write a review
to remove unconscious bias.

00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:37.690
So they remind people
about gender biases.

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:40.120
They remind people about
potentially loaded phrases,

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.360
like women, you know, needing
to have more presence, things

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.760
like that.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.320
And they write it,
they have a memo,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.050
and every manager is required to
read it right before they write

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:51.202
their performance reviews.

00:18:51.202 --> 00:18:52.660
So putting it top
of mind in people

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:56.680
right at the moment
of writing review.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.900
Similarly, on promotions,
often some organizations

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.510
are requiring that
slates for promotions

00:19:04.510 --> 00:19:07.630
always have a certain
percentage of women on them.

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:10.850
That's not to say that the
women are getting promoted.

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:11.979
It's not a quota.

00:19:11.979 --> 00:19:13.270
It's not a quota for promotion.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:16.690
It's not meant to steer the
actual promotion itself.

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:18.220
It's just meant
to say, often what

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.496
happens is, the slate doesn't
have enough women on it

00:19:21.496 --> 00:19:22.870
and so it ends up
going to a man.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:25.300
So if you actually just
make sure the slate has it,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.340
that ends up having impact.

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.100
And again, keeping in mind
that the promotion itself

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:31.890
is based on meritocracy.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.150
But that it's just
the slate that

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.950
has been sort of forced
to really make sure

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.408
that people are
removing their bias

00:19:37.408 --> 00:19:42.690
and putting different
profiles on it.

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:46.400
So the third is
accountability and results,

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:48.150
so focusing on
accountability and results.

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.970
And we've talked about
this, you know, a bit.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:53.500
And the idea that if
you don't measure it,

00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.905
it doesn't happen, right?

00:19:54.905 --> 00:19:57.030
Like, if you can't see it,
if you don't measure it,

00:19:57.030 --> 00:19:58.821
if you don't call it
out, if people are not

00:19:58.821 --> 00:20:01.920
accountable to these
metrics, then it's not

00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.760
going to do anything, right?

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:06.000
And so if you look at this,
I mean, 40% of companies

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.400
are saying they
hold their leaders

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:10.980
accountable for performance
against gender diversity.

00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.890
Going back to 80% of the
companies say it's a priority.

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:17.690
But only 40% are holding
leaders accountable.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.440
And a very small
percentage of employees

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.020
agree that the progress is
actually being measured,

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.920
and gender diversity
is being measured.

00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:25.860
So some of the things
that we're seeing here

00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.150
are how can you literally just--

00:20:30.150 --> 00:20:32.640
how are different
organizations publicizing

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:35.130
their pipeline, their funnel?

00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:37.710
How different
managers are doing,

00:20:37.710 --> 00:20:40.320
oftentimes managers don't even
realize what they're doing.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.840
So by actually
giving them the data,

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.360
this is how many people
you interviewed last year,

00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.552
and this is the percentage
of them that were women,

00:20:47.552 --> 00:20:49.260
and this is your
promotion rate of women,

00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:50.970
and this is the way
in which you've been--

00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:53.280
if you go through and look at
all your performance reviews,

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.950
these are the types of comments
you have on women versus men.

00:20:55.950 --> 00:20:59.280
Really starting to bring to
light what's happening as a way

00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:04.230
to create a lot of
visibility and opportunity.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.990
You know, for example, Ikea has
made achieving a 50/50 gender

00:21:07.990 --> 00:21:12.310
split one of the key metrics
that managers are evaluated on.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.520
Salesforce publishes diversity
numbers as we all know, right?

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.610
In 2015, Marc
Benioff said that he

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:21.130
had the goal to employ an
equal number of women and men

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:23.740
and thinks that this is
absolutely doable and is

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.950
on the path to doing that.

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:27.910
So how do you start to set
those goals and measure them?

00:21:27.910 --> 00:21:30.616
Empowering employees
to lead the change--

00:21:30.616 --> 00:21:31.990
so one of the
things always we've

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:36.370
also found is, paired with
the whole numbers game

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.800
and really making sure that
you're getting diverse numbers

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.980
and you're tracking them,
et cetera, is inclusion.

00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.762
So how do you get
more inclusion?

00:21:43.762 --> 00:21:45.220
And that's something
that has been,

00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.370
I know, probably a very big part
of how you all operate, right?

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:51.990
With the focus on diverse
teams and diversity of thought,

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.940
that's exactly what
we're talking about.

00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.220
How do you actually
create a environment

00:21:57.220 --> 00:22:00.497
that feels inclusive
for individuals

00:22:00.497 --> 00:22:02.080
of all different
types of backgrounds?

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.050
And that's a way to help
create inclusivity for women.

00:22:06.050 --> 00:22:08.292
And that's about culture,
and culture change

00:22:08.292 --> 00:22:10.000
happens all the way
down the organization

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.090
with every last person,
and engaging change agents,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:16.060
and engaging people in different
pockets of the organization

00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.620
to really drive this
cultural change.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.790
So lastly, of course,
educating people, right?

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.090
Right now, most
employees don't know

00:22:30.090 --> 00:22:31.967
how to promote gender
diversity, right?

00:22:31.967 --> 00:22:34.050
There's a lot of people
that say we want to do it,

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.402
but there's not a lot of
people that know how to do it.

00:22:36.402 --> 00:22:38.610
And whether that's telling
your middle managers that,

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:40.900
hey, if you just
literally choose--

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.230
if every man in the
middle management

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.920
chose to mentor or sponsor
one or two more women,

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:49.780
how much impact that could have.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.380
If senior leaders chose
to sponsor another woman,

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:54.870
if senior leaders chose
to speak out and make

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.360
this a priority and
really cascade this down

00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:00.150
the organization, the way in
which that can move the needle.

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:01.590
And even at the
entry level, it's

00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.680
how can you really promote
inclusive practices

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:06.180
from day one?

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.110
So it doesn't feel like
a frat or a certain type

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.630
of environment that
is not welcoming

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:14.650
to women or other types of--

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:17.842
or other diverse backgrounds.

00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.340
And then role modeling,
and this is part of it

00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:26.670
as well, so actually
calling it out.

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:30.390
I mean this is how women and
men answered whether or not

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:34.670
managers are calling out gender
biased language or behavior.

00:23:34.670 --> 00:23:38.400
It is not OK if you hear someone
say something that's offensive.

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.330
You just call it out.

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.205
I mean, imagine if
everybody called that out.

00:23:41.205 --> 00:23:42.540
It just wasn't tolerated.

00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.060
That makes a huge
difference, right?

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:47.070
Embracing different
leadership styles--

00:23:47.070 --> 00:23:49.260
I think that this is
better than calling out,

00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.860
you know, styles that are
or activities or language

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.120
that is negative.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.582
But being able to
embrace there's

00:23:56.582 --> 00:23:59.040
lots of different styles and
there's lots of different ways

00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.107
to be successful here.

00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:02.190
And we're going to role
model those different ways

00:24:02.190 --> 00:24:05.540
and celebrate
different profiles.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:08.630
So building this generation
of diversity champions,

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:13.220
training them, celebrating
them, modeling it, right?

00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:15.980
How can you celebrate--

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.345
people that are diversity
champions, even at McKinsey,

00:24:19.345 --> 00:24:20.720
we're starting to
do that, right?

00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.140
How do we celebrate people that
are making a real difference?

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.704
And that's a huge
honor to those people,

00:24:26.704 --> 00:24:28.370
and things like that
really start to get

00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:30.500
people excited and motivated.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.390
Training them, as we
talked about before,

00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:33.320
but what do they need to know?

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.710
How do they need to
behave differently?

00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:36.200
How can they make a difference?

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.240
And making sure that
you're modeling and role

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.450
modeling what you want to see.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.242
So what can you do today?

00:24:43.242 --> 00:24:44.200
These are a few things.

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.790
I'd love to, actually,
even open it up

00:24:45.790 --> 00:24:49.579
and hear from you, what
you all think you can do.

00:24:49.579 --> 00:24:51.870
But some of the things, just
to start the conversation,

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.970
around talking about why
gender diversity matters

00:24:54.970 --> 00:24:59.270
to you, both up and down.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.340
Calling out the biases,
as we mentioned.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:08.420
Not tolerating any behavior
that demonstrates bias.

00:25:08.420 --> 00:25:11.510
Creating scorecards and
measuring and monitoring,

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.740
changing your language.

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.674
Just reminding yourself to use--

00:25:15.674 --> 00:25:17.090
remind yourself
to think about it.

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.490
Sometimes it's just
as simple as that.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:21.980
Committing to sponsor women.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.660
And sharing in success
stories of women,

00:25:23.660 --> 00:25:26.910
celebrating women that
have done amazing things.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.060
So what are some other
things-- and by the way,

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:30.470
I'm also open to take questions.

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.610
But I figured I'd start
with a question to you.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.610
Which is what are some
of the things that you're

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.199
doing about it or
that you think Google

00:25:37.199 --> 00:25:38.240
should be doing about it?

00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.640
AUDIENCE: Well, my manager is
sitting two rows behind me.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.430
And with my team,
made the suggestion

00:25:50.430 --> 00:25:53.310
that we use a regularly
scheduled kind of tech talk

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.210
session where we watch YouTube
videos about technical things

00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:59.070
or non-technical
things as a group

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:00.919
and discuss them and
come here instead.

00:26:00.919 --> 00:26:02.460
And I think that's
a great, you know,

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:05.100
a great way to improve
gender diversity

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.365
and get us talking
about it more.

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.240
Admittedly, we've been
talking about it a lot

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:09.948
in the last week.

00:26:09.948 --> 00:26:14.040
But it's a great
way for a manager

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:17.009
to have an impact on their
team and spread that knowledge.

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:17.719
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:17.719 --> 00:26:18.885
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: Thank you.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:23.795
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:23.795 --> 00:26:25.170
AUDIENCE: So first
of all, thanks

00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:27.210
for coming today and
presenting this to us.

00:26:27.210 --> 00:26:29.490
The research and
metric driven approach

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:31.800
really hits it home for me.

00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:36.360
I love data, and this really
calls it out very clearly.

00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:41.430
Focusing on that data, but also
tying in people's perceptions.

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:44.310
Question for you-- you mentioned
call out bias when you see it.

00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:45.720
It only takes one voice.

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.740
So I've had experiences where
someone will say something,

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.230
and it takes me a few
seconds to process

00:26:52.230 --> 00:26:53.460
what they've actually said.

00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:54.900
And then I'm, like, wait what?

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:56.400
And then I'm like, should
I say something now?

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.500
Like, five seconds have already
gone-- now it's 10 seconds.

00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:58.999
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:58.999 --> 00:27:01.830
And it's, like, so I'm
wondering if you have

00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:04.440
any tips for calling that out.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.620
Because it sometimes does take
a little bit of time for me

00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.192
to process.

00:27:08.192 --> 00:27:09.900
And then I'm like 20
seconds has gone by,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.220
what do I do kind of a thing.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:16.479
Or if anyone else has any tips
as well, I'd love to hear them.

00:27:16.479 --> 00:27:18.270
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: I'm
happy to answer that.

00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:20.700
I feel like it's never too late.

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:21.440
Just say it.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.340
You can say hey, you
know, took me a minute

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:25.931
because I felt like that was
really inappropriate what

00:27:25.931 --> 00:27:26.430
you said.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:27.900
And I just wanted you to know.

00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.917
And you could also go
at it with the intent--

00:27:29.917 --> 00:27:32.250
I mean, I think another thing,
it's always about intent.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:34.960
So always assume positive
intent from the other person.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:38.760
And then you could have a much
greater impact in the feedback

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.660
that you're giving.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.160
So hey, I know
you might not have

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.050
meant it to come
across this way,

00:27:43.050 --> 00:27:44.880
but let me tell you
how it made me feel.

00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.830
And hey, you might
want to consider

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:48.630
not doing that next time.

00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:51.047
AUDIENCE: Awesome, thank you.

00:27:51.047 --> 00:27:52.130
AUDIENCE: So I'm a father.

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:55.580
I have four kids, and
one of them is a girl.

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.510
And she runs the house.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:01.730
But I feel like a
lot of the-- or I

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:03.200
believe that a lot
of these things

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.580
are a lot deeper
than the workplace.

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:06.830
They're foundational in the
way that we raise our kids

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:10.487
and promote values and
unintentionally buy

00:28:10.487 --> 00:28:12.820
pink things for my daughter
and blue things for my sons.

00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:16.220
And what things can
we do as parents

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:19.320
and in a sort of
a grassroots sense

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.080
and as communities
as we're raising

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.910
our kids to help with this?

00:28:24.910 --> 00:28:26.357
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: I mean, that--

00:28:26.357 --> 00:28:27.440
don't even get me started.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.155
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.155 --> 00:28:30.530
CHARLOTTE RELYEA:
I think there's

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.310
a tremendous amount we can
do as we're raising our kids.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:36.860
I mean, I can tell you
just personally what I do.

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.450
So I have a daughter and a son.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:40.484
And as much as--

00:28:40.484 --> 00:28:41.900
I mean, I try to
congratulate them

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.760
for the same types of things.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.439
So a lot of times
parents will tell

00:28:45.439 --> 00:28:46.730
the girl they're really pretty.

00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:47.896
And they don't even mean it.

00:28:47.896 --> 00:28:49.550
Or other people in
their environment

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:51.216
will tell the girl
they're really pretty

00:28:51.216 --> 00:28:54.110
and the guy he did really
well on that problem, right?

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.690
And so I try to congratulate my
daughter for problem solving,

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.590
and tell my son he
looks really cute.

00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:01.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:02.240
But no, no, seriously.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.940
And just really thinking
about the language

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:07.430
that you're using, because
that is where it starts.

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:09.860
Like, what are you
getting praise for?

00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:12.200
How are people
demonstrating love?

00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:15.080
Are you telling your
daughter that she's being

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:17.390
too bossy, like, too early on?

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:20.330
If you see two children
playing, because even if--

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.160
no matter what you
do in your household,

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.720
you're not going be able
to change what's happening

00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.190
in other people's households.

00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:26.870
But talking about it, right?

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:29.159
And even recognizing, like,
hey, so-and-so said this.

00:29:29.159 --> 00:29:30.950
But in our family, this
is what we believe,

00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:34.664
and this is how we
conduct ourselves.

00:29:34.664 --> 00:29:35.330
So I don't know.

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:37.400
You probably all
have lots of ideas

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.630
as well, if anyone
else wants to share.

00:29:43.534 --> 00:29:46.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.520
CHARLOTTE RELYEA:
The question was,

00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:53.340
given that we know that
lots of executive promotions

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.530
actually are external
hires versus just

00:29:56.530 --> 00:29:59.620
internal promotions,
how do executive search

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.440
firms and other players
that might be helping

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.610
find the slate of candidates
for senior positions

00:30:06.610 --> 00:30:09.760
contribute to or
detract from the goal

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.830
at hand, which is to
increase the number of women

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:14.300
in these senior
executive positions?

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.480
I'll tell you we
haven't specifically

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.410
looked at biases, for example,
in executive recruiting

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.540
practices.

00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:25.390
And actually, I think,
in general most people

00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:28.007
when they're talking to
executive recruiters say

00:30:28.007 --> 00:30:29.840
they want to see women
candidates, actually.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:33.040
Because it's a priority for
a lot of senior leaders.

00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.710
I will say, though,
in the end what

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:40.600
does happen is that more men
are hired in at senior levels

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.010
and laterally than women.

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:47.050
So in addition to
different promotion, women

00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.840
getting promoted
less frequently,

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.130
more men are coming in
at more senior levels.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.940
And so for that--

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.932
we haven't actually--
so I can hypothesize.

00:30:59.932 --> 00:31:01.390
I don't want to
speak for the data,

00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:03.723
because we don't actually
have the data underlying that.

00:31:03.723 --> 00:31:07.150
But my sense is that
is driven in large part

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:09.580
by a lot of the same biases
that might take place

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.320
in the recruiting and selection
process for any role, right?

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.540
That you know, the way in
which the job spec is written

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:22.870
is often much more tailored to
a man and a man's background.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:26.860
Often in the selection process,
there's a bias towards men.

00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:29.140
People tend to look
at men, and see,

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:33.070
as I mentioned before,
see a potential.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:34.779
Whereas women, they
look for performance.

00:31:34.779 --> 00:31:36.611
And so the bar tends
to be higher for women.

00:31:36.611 --> 00:31:39.050
There's a lot of biases that
take place in that process.

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.070
And I think that that's
probably where it's coming from.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:44.497
I'm not sure it's
purely based on

00:31:44.497 --> 00:31:46.330
what's happening at the
executive recruiting

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:47.750
side of things.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:48.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.959
Thanks for sharing
all this with us.

00:31:49.959 --> 00:31:52.850
It's really great to see
practical applications

00:31:52.850 --> 00:31:53.722
of things.

00:31:53.722 --> 00:31:55.180
So I have one thing
to share that I

00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.590
feel like has been super
personally helpful for me

00:31:57.590 --> 00:32:01.270
on the changing your own
language bit of things.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:04.600
So a lot of us participate
a ton in both hiring,

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.270
so writing reviews
for people who

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:09.940
are coming in as candidates, and
also in the sort of performance

00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.640
review process when you write
peer reviews for all the people

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:16.150
who are going up for promotion
or just generating feedback.

00:32:16.150 --> 00:32:19.480
And taking out gender pronouns
entirely from feedback

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.660
that you write, I feel like has
both a big impact on the way

00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.399
that I write, but
also for people

00:32:24.399 --> 00:32:26.440
who are going to just be
reading feedback, right?

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.460
This is going to committee.

00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.860
It's going to a hiring committee
or a performance review

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.020
committee for promotions.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:34.156
Not having gender
pronouns, like,

00:32:34.156 --> 00:32:36.030
it does change the way
that you have to write

00:32:36.030 --> 00:32:37.988
and the way that you use
adjectives and the way

00:32:37.988 --> 00:32:40.690
that people will interpret
what you're writing.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.570
And it's made a big difference
for me in just my personal--

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:43.890
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: That's great.

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:45.460
AUDIENCE: --capabilities
of writing,

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:47.380
I think, useful
feedback about people.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.650
So I'd say for people who
are doing that on their own,

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:52.499
or if you are working
with other people,

00:32:52.499 --> 00:32:54.040
even out of your
e-mails, when you're

00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:55.960
writing about what
someone else had said,

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:59.680
or recap for a meeting, like,
trying not to rely on those

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.040
actually pushes you a
little bit further in giving

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:05.980
useful descriptions of
someone or their projects

00:33:05.980 --> 00:33:07.997
or what has happened
in a given scenario.

00:33:07.997 --> 00:33:10.330
And it's, like, a really small
change that you can make.

00:33:10.330 --> 00:33:10.840
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: Yeah.

00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:13.490
I mean, and that's very
aligned to a lot of the resumes

00:33:13.490 --> 00:33:14.710
screen--

00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:17.230
blind resume screening
tests that have been done.

00:33:17.230 --> 00:33:19.330
Where literally,
there have been tests

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:22.660
that have shown the minute
that any understanding of what

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:25.580
the gender is of the
applicant is taken away,

00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.290
then all of a sudden the
hiring goes to parity.

00:33:29.290 --> 00:33:31.000
It's amazing, right, exactly--

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.240
like if you can take that
away, how much of a difference

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.065
that can make.

00:33:35.065 --> 00:33:40.480
AUDIENCE: So I'm white,
Anglo-Saxon Protestant, male,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.820
identify straight, a
manager, so on and so forth.

00:33:43.820 --> 00:33:47.720
So like, the bingo of being part
of the privileged class, so as

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.899
to speak.

00:33:48.899 --> 00:33:50.690
So I'm wondering from
your research looking

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:52.900
at many different
companies, how do you

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:55.770
go straight at that majority
to affect change at scale?

00:33:55.770 --> 00:33:57.520
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: How
do you-- sorry what?

00:33:57.520 --> 00:34:02.220
AUDIENCE: How have you seen or
how do you go at people like me

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:05.380
at scale in organizations to
make them part of the change

00:34:05.380 --> 00:34:07.150
and not rely on
underrepresented groups

00:34:07.150 --> 00:34:08.484
to stand up to make that change?

00:34:08.484 --> 00:34:10.608
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: Well,
it's literally engaging you

00:34:10.608 --> 00:34:12.040
in part of the process, right?

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.130
It's engaging you in being
a champion of change,

00:34:15.130 --> 00:34:17.650
in signing up to
mentor or sponsor

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:21.070
a set of women, in driving
specific initiatives

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:22.610
within the organization.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.659
In fact, it's really important.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:26.409
And we've found that
it's really important

00:34:26.409 --> 00:34:28.360
that men lead a lot
of these initiatives,

00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.590
that it's not all women lead.

00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:32.770
So I think the real
important thing

00:34:32.770 --> 00:34:35.920
is to get people like you
to actually own and do

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.832
and lead some of this
and sign up for this.

00:34:39.832 --> 00:34:40.540
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.998
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that I've done as a manager is,

00:34:42.998 --> 00:34:47.380
if I see somebody doing things
that I know will be negative

00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:50.409
towards them-- so if they
use language of I'm sorry,

00:34:50.409 --> 00:34:53.469
or that's the one that always
gets me is the I'm sorry

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.659
or I'm bothering you
or things like that--

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.720
to literally tell
them, don't say that.

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.690
Say it this way,
and this is why.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:03.190
So call out those small things.

00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:04.900
Because I think sometimes
when people hear the word

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:07.358
mentorship, they think, oh,
I've got to take them to lunch.

00:35:07.358 --> 00:35:09.850
And I've got to do this,
and I've got to do that.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:12.249
It's the simple, you're
walking back from the meeting

00:35:12.249 --> 00:35:12.790
to your desk.

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.248
And say, hey, I
heard you say this.

00:35:14.248 --> 00:35:19.000
And it negated what you were
saying because of this reason.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.680
Because people need to hear
that immediately and repeatedly.

00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.880
And it took me a long time
to learn those things.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.880
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: Well,
yeah, and that goes back

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.440
to one of the real
drivers, which

00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.800
is getting developmental
feedback in hard messages.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.140
And people tend to
not do that for women.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.640
And so telling the
person, don't go

00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.848
sit on this side of the room.

00:35:37.848 --> 00:35:39.400
Sit at the table
when you walk in.

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:42.010
Take the main seat at the table.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:43.330
Speak up in the meeting.

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.800
I want to hear your voice.

00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:46.600
Don't use like and
sorry and don't

00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.710
caveat what you're saying.

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:50.540
Be assertive and forceful, if
you need to, in that meeting.

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.020
Like, I think giving that
coaching and that feedback

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:54.280
is quite valuable.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.670
Now of course, not
necessarily trying

00:35:57.670 --> 00:36:02.201
to only promote one kind
of leadership style,

00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:04.450
right, you also want to
recognize different leadership

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:06.780
styles and some people have more
assertive leadership styles,

00:36:06.780 --> 00:36:08.863
and some people have more
quiet leadership styles.

00:36:08.863 --> 00:36:09.702
And all that's fine.

00:36:09.702 --> 00:36:12.160
But definitely giving feedback
where people are taking away

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.440
from their own credibility
or not stepping up

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.080
and owning leadership
opportunities the way they can.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:20.400
I think that's really,
really important.

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.710
AUDIENCE: Hi, thank
you for reinforcing

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.170
much of what we try to do
here at Google with lots

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:26.040
of external data.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.799
That's always necessary.

00:36:27.799 --> 00:36:29.340
First, I'd like to
say that was Matt,

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.840
and he's actually
one of my mentors.

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.300
So he's sort of practicing
what he preaches already.

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:36.230
And I'm like the opposite
of everything he just said.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.090
So kudos to him.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:42.560
My question is, do you
have data around or a POV

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:49.860
on this idea that, by focusing
on women's empowerment, gender

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.910
parity, elevating
women in the workforce,

00:36:54.910 --> 00:36:57.420
that that is
discriminatory against men?

00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:04.020
CHARLOTTE RELYEA:
I don't think so.

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:08.730
I mean, we're so far from being
discriminatory against men

00:37:08.730 --> 00:37:12.012
right now, that I
think it's sort of--

00:37:12.012 --> 00:37:13.860
it's cleaning up
some of the issues

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.490
rather than trying to put
in place quotas or things

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:18.430
like that.

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:21.480
And so I think if anything is
perceived as discriminatory

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.970
against men or if there is
something like a quota that

00:37:23.970 --> 00:37:26.520
can be perceived
in that way, that

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:29.470
can be damaging to the
whole cause, right?

00:37:29.470 --> 00:37:31.860
But all of the things in the
data that we've shown here

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:34.200
has been about things that
are cleaning up the issues,

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:37.706
not swinging the pendulum the
other way around, I would say.

00:37:37.706 --> 00:37:38.830
AUDIENCE: I agree with you.

00:37:38.830 --> 00:37:40.538
Just I'm always playing
devil's advocate.

00:37:40.538 --> 00:37:41.250
So thank you.

00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.130
CHARLOTTE RELYEA:
Thank you for that.

00:37:42.130 --> 00:37:43.320
No, I appreciate that.

00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.040
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.280
I have a question in regards
to both gender diversity,

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.750
but also age diversity.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:52.210
So I was speaking with one of
my Google mentors the other day,

00:37:52.210 --> 00:37:54.900
and we were talking about
the job postings even

00:37:54.900 --> 00:37:55.862
on the Google site.

00:37:55.862 --> 00:37:57.320
I don't know if
you guys have seen.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:01.380
But obviously, it shows x
amount of years of experience.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.420
And he was saying
he read a study

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:06.106
that even though-- so it
says four years of experience

00:38:06.106 --> 00:38:06.605
required.

00:38:06.605 --> 00:38:08.915
And some men will look at
that, and they only have two,

00:38:08.915 --> 00:38:10.790
and they'll be, like,
I'm going to go for it.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:12.660
Where girls are
like, I have three.

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:15.000
But I'll hold back until I
have that fourth before I

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.530
can go for that position.

00:38:16.530 --> 00:38:18.862
And so I mean, that
sometimes I have an urge,

00:38:18.862 --> 00:38:20.070
and I'm, like, you know what?

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:21.400
I read the qualifications.

00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.340
I'm like, I could
totally go for that.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.230
But I see the level
of experience.

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:28.710
I'm like, obviously, being
out of college and things

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.150
like that, you don't have that.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.480
But with technology nowadays,
those years of experience

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.740
aren't really relevant
to what's happening.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:38.779
So I wanted to get your
opinion on those postings.

00:38:38.779 --> 00:38:40.570
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: It's
a really good point.

00:38:40.570 --> 00:38:42.450
And there's two
sides to that coin.

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.210
So one is the way in which the
job posting is being written.

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.640
And should you write it--

00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:48.820
well, no, actually, let
me take a step back.

00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:51.300
It is very much
proven over and over

00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:55.770
that women tend to hold a
higher bar for themselves.

00:38:55.770 --> 00:38:58.151
A man and a woman will go
into the exact same review.

00:38:58.151 --> 00:39:00.150
And the woman will come
out and say, oh, my god,

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:02.370
I did, like, here are the
700 things I did terribly.

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:04.070
And the man will be,
like, I rocked it--

00:39:04.070 --> 00:39:06.390
literally, the same language.

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:09.360
And similarly, exactly as you're
saying, men will be like, ah,

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.600
four years experience?

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.590
I was in college for four years.

00:39:13.590 --> 00:39:16.319
You know, and a woman will
be, like, oh, no, I had four--

00:39:16.319 --> 00:39:17.610
I have six years of experience.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:20.096
But four of that, two of
them weren't exactly right,

00:39:20.096 --> 00:39:20.970
and blah, blah, blah.

00:39:20.970 --> 00:39:25.224
Like, it is just human
nature, and a lot of studies

00:39:25.224 --> 00:39:25.890
have shown that.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.110
So there's two things
to do about that.

00:39:28.110 --> 00:39:32.340
One is to educate
women on self-advocacy,

00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.830
and how do you start
to think about yourself

00:39:34.830 --> 00:39:38.310
and actually reach higher,
reach harder, and be

00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:40.792
OK with taking more risks
and things like that.

00:39:40.792 --> 00:39:43.000
And I think that is actually
an important part of it.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.040
And we, for example, at
McKinsey do a lot around that.

00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:46.650
Which is how can
you raise your hand

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:49.250
and ask for more opportunities
and be more-- you know,

00:39:49.250 --> 00:39:52.050
if your male counterpart
is going and asking

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.660
all these other
people for promotions,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.575
you can do the same.

00:39:56.575 --> 00:39:58.200
And then secondly,
I think there's also

00:39:58.200 --> 00:40:00.116
the part about the writing
of the job posting.

00:40:00.116 --> 00:40:02.550
So if we know that women
read it that way, maybe

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.190
trying to shift the language a
little bit so it doesn't say--

00:40:05.190 --> 00:40:08.640
you know, it seems that the
four years of experience

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:12.150
is more of a nice to have or
you can write it in such a way

00:40:12.150 --> 00:40:16.362
that you're not
playing to that bias.

00:40:16.362 --> 00:40:17.820
I think that's a
really good point.

00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:18.611
AUDIENCE: One more.

00:40:18.611 --> 00:40:20.085
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: OK, one more.

00:40:20.085 --> 00:40:21.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.710
You were talking a lot about--

00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:24.126
thank you for being
here, firstly.

00:40:24.126 --> 00:40:25.590
So this study is
super interesting.

00:40:25.590 --> 00:40:27.381
You were talking a lot
about self advocacy.

00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:29.636
But early in the study,
we heard about how

00:40:29.636 --> 00:40:31.260
women who advocate
a lot for themselves

00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:33.450
are perceived to be
aggressive or bossy.

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.740
How do you manage
those two perceptions?

00:40:36.740 --> 00:40:38.920
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: So that's
a really good question.

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.750
I think that it's about
managing away the bossy issue.

00:40:43.750 --> 00:40:46.380
I think the answer
is not to let women--

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:49.020
not to tell women,
OK, well, then just

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.190
operate within that bias.

00:40:50.190 --> 00:40:51.870
It's that we have
to change the bias.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:52.560
So you're right.

00:40:52.560 --> 00:40:53.610
I mean, I think there's--

00:40:53.610 --> 00:40:55.980
women get called-- it's a
double-edged sword, right?

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.237
I mean, it's sort of like
the damned if you do,

00:40:58.237 --> 00:40:59.070
damned if you don't.

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:00.314
Where do we stand?

00:41:00.314 --> 00:41:01.230
But I think you just--

00:41:01.230 --> 00:41:03.000
I mean, self-advocacy--

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.520
I think that the bar,
the barrier between how

00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.820
women self advocate, or the sort
of the gap between how women

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:11.250
self advocate versus
men is even bigger

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:14.640
than the gap between
how women are

00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.269
perceived as bossy versus not.

00:41:16.269 --> 00:41:17.310
So I would just sort of--

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:19.620
even though they are linked,
I would separate the two

00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:21.536
and address them each
equally, because I think

00:41:21.536 --> 00:41:22.704
they're both very important.

00:41:22.704 --> 00:41:24.120
And it's better
to be called bossy

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.260
and still get the promotion--

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:25.885
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:25.885 --> 00:41:27.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.700
CHARLOTTE RELYEA: --you know,
than to not get it at all.

00:41:32.077 --> 00:41:32.910
- Thank you so much.

00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:33.618
This was awesome.

00:41:33.618 --> 00:41:34.240
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.520
- And thanks to all of you.

00:41:41.582 --> 00:41:43.040
Because it was a
really great show.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:44.570
And you gave some
fantastic advice.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:46.611
The other thing that struck
me as I was listening

00:41:46.611 --> 00:41:48.990
was just the awesome advice
that you gave each other.

00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:52.230
And so I hope that each of you
takes away at least one nugget

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.960
from this conversation, whether
from Charlotte and McKinsey,

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.910
or from what some of
your colleagues shared.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:59.490
And I passionately believe the
way we address this over time

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.599
is really the continuity
of the conversation.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.390
So many of the things
that we talked about,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.740
if we're able to sort of
quickly and easily bat

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:08.790
back and forth what
we heard, what we saw,

00:42:08.790 --> 00:42:11.437
what the impact was, we will
consistently get better.

00:42:11.437 --> 00:42:14.020
So please keep the conversation
going, both in these settings,

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:15.510
but also in the hallways.

00:42:15.510 --> 00:42:18.150
And continue to look to
each other and to all of us

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.042
for tips to move this forward.

00:42:20.042 --> 00:42:21.000
Thank you guys so much.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.750
[APPLAUSE]
