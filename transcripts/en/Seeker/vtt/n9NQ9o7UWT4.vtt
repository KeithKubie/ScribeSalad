00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.029
Unless you’ve been avoiding the internet
for a decade (and if so, welcome!)

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:06.480
You’ve probably heard about the bee rapture.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.280
In 2006, the first instances of something
called colony collapse disorder were reported.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.119
That winter, 25 percent of all bee colonies
in the US were destroyed.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:18.700
That means billions of bees.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.580
CCD is this strange phenomenon where worker
bees leave the colony never to return!

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.680
The queen, bee youngins, and all that honey
is just left behind.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.710
CCD could devastate food production, as bee-pollination
accounts for 15-billion dollars a year in

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:33.940
crops.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.570
No bees, no foods!

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.600
So, for at least a decade, scientists have
been working like a bee to try and solve CCD.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.359
They've found at least 60 different environmental
factors...

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:48.510
Like a combination of invasive pests, climate
change and pesticide poisoning.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.000
After all this research, a new report has
finally given us some good news.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.329
The bees are making a comeback!

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.739
The USDA just released its latest honeybee
health survey, aaaand the number of honeybees

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.960
is on the rise!

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.590
There are now 2.89 million honeybee colonies,
a 3% increase from the previous year.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.170
Also, the number of hives lost to Colony Collapse
disorder is down 27% from the previous year.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.170
Victorious!

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.170
Right?

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:20.640
That said, there are still some major threats
to the hives, mainly two things: the pesky

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.670
varroa mite and pesticides.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.160
The mite, also called the varroa destructor
(don't get excited it's bad) is the ultimate

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.360
honey bee pest.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.780
These destructors are parasites that thrive
inside hives, sucking blood from the bees

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.940
while transmitting viruses directly into their
bloodstream.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.340
They end up leaving the bees weakened, with
shorter lifespans, and in some cases with

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.480
deformed wings.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.680
Honey bees are part of a collective.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.960
They all work together and need each other
to keep the colony alive.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.370
So, if a hive is mite infested to the point
of no return, it will eventually collapse.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.230
By nature the varroa mite is not a migratory
pest, which we thought was good for bee-kind,

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:08.160
but now a new paper found it is able to hitchhike
on wandering bees and spread to new hives.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.030
This is particularly problematic for commercial
beekeeping where beehives are kept in close

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.970
proximity because the varroa destructors ride
on the backs of weakened honey bees to neighboring

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.610
colonies and the infestation starts all over.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.530
Varroa destructors were wreaking havoc in
42% of U.S. colonies between April and June

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.100
of 2017.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.120
Which is down from last year's figures, but
still, isn’t quite where we want it to be.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.510
The secondary enemy for the bee are pesticides,
particularly neonicotinoids.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.730
This year, the USDA reported that pesticides
were responsible for 13% of total damage to

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.730
the bees.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.380
Neonicotinoids, or neonics, are synthetic
chemical insecticides that are very similar

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.710
in molecular structure to nicotine; it’s
even got the word in it.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.090
When a neonic is sprayed on crops, the chemicals
are absorbed in the plant's nectar and pollen.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.510
This makes the flowers toxic to the bees who
swing by for lunch.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.760
Countless studies have drawn a link between
neonics and neurological damage in bees.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.180
It’s also reportedly affected their ability
to fly home, which may explain why worker

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.030
bees aren’t returning to their colonies,
hence the colony collapse.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.770
So here's the buzz: the bees are bouncing
back but they need all the help they can get.

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.520
If you want to help the bees and happen to
be a gardener, avoid using outdoor insecticides

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.980
near flowers that bees might be attracted
to, or nurture some plants that could be future

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.290
pollination pit stops for our buzzy friends!

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.590
Just bee aware.

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.990
Bees are the best and I love them.

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.210
But they work so hard!

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.930
Do they sleep?

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.819
Julian has the answer here.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:39.990
Are you worried about bees?

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.070
Bee fatigue if you will?
