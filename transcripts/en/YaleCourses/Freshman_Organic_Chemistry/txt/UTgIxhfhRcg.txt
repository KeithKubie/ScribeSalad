Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. Um, we, this is the sh the slides from the, and last time we didn't quite finish it. Equilibrium versus residence. Remember equilibrium is a case where you have two different species, different structures and they you go back and forth between them maybe fast, maybe slow. Okay. Like the hydrogen could be attached to the top or it could be attached to the bottom I oxygen and those are different. Two different what's called isomers. We'll get to that later on. Or You could imagine the same thing if you take the hydrogen off, you could have a short double bond oxygen and along single bond oxygen. Or they could exchange as to which oxygen was long and which was short. So you could have an equilibrium there, but it turns out you don't write that. In fact, it's not two different species, right? It's one species. It's a single minimum, not a double minimum.

Speaker 1:          00:53          Right. Now, how do you know this? How do you know it's just one nuclear geometry with an intermediate bond distance? The only way you know is by experiment or by some really fancy calculation that you have to believe. A lot of people would believe experiments before calculations, some or the other way around. Okay. But there's evidence from a technique called Electron paramagnetic resonance or Epr that shows that indeed this is one species of single minimum, right? Well, if you have an extra electron on it, then you have the carboxylase an ion. Then again, it's just one species, a single minimum. Right? And there's evidence from that from infrared spectroscopy that we'll talk about next time next semester. Okay. But don't be disappointed that you're not able to predict this. A lot of really smart, experienced people couldn't predict it. Right? This is lore. If you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary, it says that lore is that which is learned learning Scottish scholarship area edition.

Speaker 1:          01:59          Also in recent use applied to the body of traditional facts, anecdotes, or beliefs relating to some particular substance subject. So a lot of things are Lori, just have to learn them, right? You can't predict them ahead of time. There are way too subtle, right? So don't be disappointed because you haven't had enough time yet to, to get the law. You're not supposed to know it yet. Right. It would be nice if Lewis theory was so accurate and straight forward that if you could draw two structures, there are two structures and it's a double minimum. Right, but that's not true. Right, and you have to know from something and you don't have time to know yet. As time goes on, maybe you'll figure it out. This is a, from a good textbook. It might be the one that will adopt next semester. It's, it's a quote that says empirical rules.

Speaker 1:          02:52          It's going to give empirical rules for assessing the relative importance of the resonance structures, molecules and ions. That is if you have two different pictures that you can draw for the thing, does it look halfway in between them? Almost all like one, almost all like the other or some fraction of the way between them. How? How far is it one way or the other? Right. These are two different pictures you draw to try to show different aspects of the same thing, but there is one real thing. The molecule doesn't know about resonance. Right. It just knows what it is. The problem is with our notation. Okay? But anyhow, here's what they say. So rules that will allow you to use this concept more productively by deciding which ones are better, which look more like the real thing. Okay? So it gives rules and that number's them.

Speaker 1:          03:39          One resonance structures involved. No change in the positions of nuclei. Only electron distribution is involved. That is when you draw these two structures, you don't move the Adams, you just change where you draw a single bond or a double bond or a dotted bond or something like that, right? And in fact, that's not even true because it's not the electrons know where they want to be, right? It's the way we draw them. That's uncertain, right? So when you draw two different resonance structures, you're not changing. Where are the electrons? Are you just changing the lines you draw? Is that clear? It's our notation that's at fault. Okay? Number two, structures in which all first row Adams have filled octets are generally important. However, resulting formal charges. We talked last time about how you get formal charges, right? And electronegativity differences. And of course we have to know what electronegativity is, but you've heard about it at least can make appropriate non octet structures.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Comparably important to have a bad charge distribution. Even though you have octets, it still might not be a very good structure. Okay. Number three, the more important structures are those involving a minimum of charge separation. So you don't want to have formal charge separation, particularly among atoms of comparable electronegativity structures with negative charge is assigned to electronegative atoms may also be important. So if you're going to get a charge, put it where it wants to be right now, look at this more carefully. Uh, number two, it says generally import. It doesn't say always important, but generally, right? That's not such a great rule because you have to know when there's going to be an exception, okay. Or however, right? This doesn't sound like the, the uh, 10 commandments graven in stone. Right? Or can make an APP thing that, not that it will, but it can or particularly or may also be important.

Speaker 1:          05:53          These are all weasel words because the rules or not rules, right? And at the time, this is all lore again, so people write these rules, but really the people who are writing the rules know the answers ahead of time. And thank God you generally works that way. And mostly we can get away with it, but these are not rules like the rules you want to learn in physics. I mean you, you want to learn these because it's, it's sort of handy, but don't believe them. Okay. And notice at the top that it's empirical rules. It's not a fundamental theory. These are just ways of sort of correlating a bunch of the lore that's come in, right? And what's important is the experiment's not theories like this. They will get better theories later. Okay. So the goal of this Louis stuff was from the number of valence electrons.

Speaker 1:          06:44          It would be nice to be able to predict the constitution that is the valence numbers for the different atoms. How many atoms of one kind or another get together to make a molecule, uh, that reactivity. And we've seen a little bit of that. At least that unshared pairs can get together with Vaco doorbells and make a new bond. That wasn't something that was part of the original rules of valence, right? And maybe something about charge distribution as well. Now let's look at the case of o two and o three and apply some of this stuff. So o two you can have complete the octets by bringing two oxygen atoms together, forming two bonds between them. So that looks pretty good and it's a double bond and we can draw it that way with just lines and forget that unshared pairs, if we're not particularly concerned with them at a given time.

Speaker 1:          07:35          Okay. Now suppose you make oh three you could do the same kind of trick there and make a three membered ring, or you could make it linear or bent instead of a of a symmetrical three membered ring. So you got to have an equal lateral triangle like that. Or You could have it like this, have o two and bring in another oxygen on one of the lone pairs. Right now, that's not an equal lateral triangle. It's a triangle of some sort or could, could conceivably be a straight line. We're not quite sure what the geometric implications are. Okay. But we could call it an open structure as a pair as compared to the ring structure. Okay. And we could draw it like that and the formal charges would be as shown. Why? Because that pair that originally belonged only to the original top oxygen of o two is now shared with the other oxygen.

Speaker 1:          08:25          So it one of them loses half interest in a pair. The other gains have interest in the parent that's plus minus. Okay. So the try Vaillant oxygen as positive as you would expect right now, what is the true structure of that molecule? Ozone o three? Well, you have to do some experiment to find that out or some uh, high faluting calculation that you believe a quantum mechanical calculations. So it could be a ring or it could be an open and notice in the open structure you should have two resonance structures because you could draw it that way. Or You could draw it that way. And it could be two minimum. It could be a double minima double minimum situation where it could be distorted one way or the other and click back and forth. Or it could be that the tooth structure is in the true structure is in between with equal bond distances, right?

Speaker 1:          09:18          So we have to find out something about this. Now, one way of finding that out is to, uh, is to do calculations and draw a graph that shows what the answer is. And that's what we're going to do here. It's based on some fairly recent high level calculations, but the problem is drawing the graph because if you want to be able to show the structure you have to, to, to how many variables do you have to specify to say what the structure of o three is, how many numbers would you have to have? It's a trial. It's three particles, right? So if you gave this distance and this distance and this distance, that would fix the triangle. Or You could give this distance and this distance and the angle here, that would also specify the triangle. Okay. But at any way you slice it, you have to have three numbers to tell the structure and then you have have to have another number in your graph to say what the energy is when it has that structure.

Speaker 1:          10:19          Okay? So you have to plot four variables and that's not trivial on a piece of paper to plot a graph with four variables in it, okay? So three distances plus energy or two distances in an angle and energy you need to plot. So if you're good at plotting things that have had a lot of experience, great. But if you need a little warm up exercise, you could look at this webpage that you get get by clicking up at the top there, right? And it uses these graphs to give you a little exercise in plotting things that are in many dimensions day. But we're not going to do that in class. That's just to do on your own or with the discussion section, okay? And we'll show the specific example of how we're going to do it in the case of o three so ti does specify oh three we need four dimensions.

Speaker 1:          11:14          Now here we have a plot that shows one distance, the second distance and the angle, okay, that's, that'll specify where the three oxygens are. But uh, Rutenberg and his coworkers here in 1997, when they did the fancy calculation, uh, did it a little differently. They constrained it, they didn't allow everything to vary. They said we're going to require the two distances to be the same, right? So now instead of three variables, you have only two and you can block those two, uh, on, on a two dimensional paper, you can plot two things. Okay? So here's here, we're going to plot the position of if you know where that, if the two distances are equal, right? Then if you know the position at the top right, you know the position at the top left because the original oxygen is at the origin zero, zero. Everybody with me on that?

Speaker 1:          12:09          So we're going to look only at where the top right oxygen is and the other one will be someplace symmetrically related to it. Okay? So we're going to blow that up and here's the plot they give them now. So, so now any point on this, we'll specify a precise geometry of the three oxygens. Everybody with me, we choose a point that tells where the top right one is. The bottom one is at zero zero and the top left is just on the other side and the corresponding mirror image position. So any point on that thing will specify the structure, but we now have we still that, but that's used up our two dimensions of the paper. How do we show the energy? Can you think of a three dimensional graph you've ever used?

Speaker 2:          12:57          Pardon me?

Speaker 1:          12:59          You could color code it. You could make red really high and blue, really low. That would be one way to do it. There. There are earlier ways before printing made it, our computers made it easy to make colors. Did you ever go hiking? Have Hud contour lines like like a geological map? Right. Okay. So we can draw contour lines that show where the, what the energy is for every one of these geometries. And so at that, notice that at that position that x, it turns out to be what would the red structure would be here, which is a ring. Okay. Equal. Lateral. Okay. And this structure is open. Okay. And I chose those particular ones because when you do the fancy calculation, those turn out to be the ones that are at the bottom of valleys. Low Energy, okay. And if you distort away from those, the energy goes up.

Speaker 1:          13:58          Now you can go up any direction. You go from one of the bottoms of the valleys, you go up in energy, but there's some particularly interesting positions. A particularly interesting position is that one cause that's the past that that's the lowest you can go. The lowest energy that's required to go from one valley to the other. Everybody I think has probably done enough hiking to realize that that's the way you'd like to hike or that if you were, if you spilled a cup of water up at the past, it would run down both ways. Okay. Now, in fact, we can use that concept to make it even a simpler graph where we don't need to draw contour lines because we could take the steepest descent path. Okay. If you pour the water out at the pass and follow how it will trickle down, it'll take the steepest way to go down.

Speaker 1:          14:49          It turns out it crosses every tour perpendicularly. Okay, so you follow that and that would go down to the bottom. And then if you kept going, like if you dropped a marble or something and it rolled down to the bottom, it would keep going. So there is a particularly interesting path. Not that the true molecule would necessarily have to follow that path, but it's a well defined path that gets from one valley to the other. So now what you could do is take a knife and slice this thing along that Green Line and unfolded so it's flat. Does everybody see how that would be like? I remember once we took a, when I was young, we took a family vacation and the AAA sent you a map that showed you know where you would go. But it also showed the, along the, you know, along a particular highway and it also showed another map that showed how high you were all the time as you went along the roads.

Speaker 1:          15:46          Got The idea. So this is exactly that kind of thing where as you go along that green road, there are different altitudes. So we could just, we could draw it this way. Does everyone see how that works? So it's not quite as specific about geometry anymore the way the previous one was, but it shows how, how much energy you need as you go along. Okay. And a particularly important one, there are two things that are really important. One is how high much one valley is compared to the other, how much more stable one is. And the other is how much higher is the past? How hard is it to get from one to the other? Okay. So that's uh, so, so there are now is in a two dimensional graph that you can draw on. A piece of paper is something that gives you this information.

Speaker 1:          16:34          Okay. Uh, but this required that we choose our one two equals r two three in order to make this simplification, right. It, the guys who did the calculations said, if we don't make our one two equal to r two, three, then it turns out that all the structures are still higher in energy. So these are the lowest energy structures, right? Although they can't plot them on a piece of paper. Okay. So, uh, so the lowest energy structure is this open form and it does have our one to equal our two three. It's a resonance structure halfway between, not one double bond in one single bond, but a symmetrical one. Okay. So it's a symmetrical single minimum found by calculation and there's experimental evidence that supports that too, but it's more complicated. Now how about the charge distribution? What would the Lewis structures that we've drawn here predict about charge separate, uh, separation? Would there be charged any place do you think on the basis of this and the real molecule, which is symmetrical, what do you think? Anybody got a suggestion? Yeah. Oxygen.

Speaker 3:          17:51          Regardless of which to structure that time. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          17:54          Both structures have it positive in the middle. So that looks like a good prediction, right? And then, uh, partially negative and equally negative on the two ends. Now is that true? Well, here's a picture that the based again on Quan. So the prediction is positive in the middle, negative on the ends. Is it true? Well, there's the truth. There's the structure, the minimum energy according to calculation, right? Quantum mechanical calculation. And we can draw what's called the surface potential of that structure, which again comes from calculation. So you put a proton, you define the molecular surface and that is a little bit of a problem, but we'll talk about that later where the molecular surfaces, but then you put a proton at a point on it. And we talked about this before. And for ammonium chloride you put a proton on and you find, or no, it was the, the uh, uh, Bnh six we talked about the surface potential.

Speaker 1:          18:51          Here's the same thing for o three, and you'll notice the surface potential is high in the middle, a bad place to put a proton because there's positive charge there and it's low. On the two ends at least someplace on the two ends. Right. So more or less that Lewis structure predicted this. Right. So that's great. Okay. We're not confident that we'll always work, but maybe the law will build up that way. Okay. And it does. Okay, so charge distribution also. So reactivity we saw was a special attribute of this nice Lewis Theory and charge distribution at least qualitatively, if not in detail for o three and also for the Bnh six. Now how about specific distances and specific angles? We'll get into that later on as to whether you can do that from something like a Lewis structure.

Speaker 1:          19:51          And how about the energy content? Wow, that's not so good actually for with just Lewis structures, but we'll test it later. Okay, so the Lewis dot structures, it attempts to provide a physical basis for the valence rules based on completing octets and sharing electrons for bonds. What it gives us new is reactivity due to unshared payers where both of the hooks in the bond come from the same Adam, you might say, and it's convenient for electron bookkeeping. It certainly tells you what the molecular charge is. The uh, formal atomic charges are qualitatively realistic as we've just seen, at least in the case of o three.

Speaker 1:          20:39          And there's this question of stability and resonance, but resonance actually is not something nature knows anything about. It's just a correction. We try to apply to having made drawings based on Lewis Theory. It's not something serious. No, but this leaves us with some serious questions. Why does Lewis Theory work? What's so great about octets? Why not have a different number? Right? Or if you have assessed tete instead of an octet, how bad is it or how bad or structures that have charged separation had said in those rules that you don't want to have charge separation. Well, how bad is it? Suppose you had a choice. You either had to have a sextet instead of an octet or you had to have charge separation, which one would win?

Speaker 4:          21:31          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:33          How bad is bad charge separation? Remember it said that if you put the negative charge on an electronegative atom, that's not so very bad. But how bad.

Speaker 4:          21:45          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          21:46          Now, last year in the Wiki, there came an interesting comment. Somebody said, I have a question. When drawing these structures, is it more important to try to fill the octet or to have the lowest formal charge on as many atoms, especially carbon as possible? And why? That's a good question because Lewis doesn't tell you that at all. Okay. And there's further the question, is this at all true? Are there electron? This is a really important question. We're going to spend some time on it. Are there electrons in between the nuclei that hold them together? Pairs of electrons. It'll take us several lectures to get to answer that question. Are there electron pairs between Nuclei and, and, and are, are there unshared ones on some atoms? What, what's the nature of the forest laws? That's what we're after. Remember here altogether now as to whether Lewis theory is right.

Speaker 1:          22:41          There's a very fundamental theorem in physics that was developed in 1839 by Samuel earn Shaw, who was a tutor at Cambridge. Uh, and the, the statement of the theorem is that in systems governed by inverse square force laws, things like gravity, magnetism, uh, electrical, electrostatic interaction, there can be no local minimum or maximum of potential energy. He proved it mathematically. It's not our business to repeat his proof, but that's the statement of it. But we want to understand what that means. That one thing that means is that you, if you have Coolum bake interaction positive, negative, you can't have a minimum energy structure that has a nucleus here and eight electrons at the corner of a cube because they're inverse square force laws. And that can't be a minimum energy. If it distorted, it would keep going. Now can visualize

Speaker 4:          23:46          earn cias there. I'm here in terms of, uh, electrostatic for electrostatics by the analogy that you've all seen of magnetic lines of force. Everybody's seen something like this, I think, right? Uh, and the idea, if it's electrostatic rather than magnetic, the idea is that lines of force emerge from a positive charge and converge on a negative charge. And then you'd make them continuous by drawing these lines of force, which iron filings of course did in that case. And this was the idea of Michael Farah day, whom we met a little while back and he thought these lines of force, we're real physical things, right?

Speaker 1:          24:27          Most people don't think that now they think they're just graphs of that involve inverse square forced laws. But he thought they were real. And the neat thing about them is they not only show the direction of the force that upon that, uh, charged body would feel because of the other charge body, the one that created the lines of force, they not only show the force, but they show the direction of the forest. They all show should also show how strong the force is. And the strength of the force is by the density of lines, the denser the lines, the stronger the force. Everybody's familiar with this idea.

Speaker 4:          25:09          Okay,

Speaker 1:          25:10          speak up if things are not familiar because I'm assuming they are. If I say so. Okay, so you've seen that. Now let's just think about that a little bit. Suppose you look at the line density here through that little line there, three lines of force that pass. So let's say that means they're three for the force is three at that and it's obviously pointing to the right. Okay. Now suppose you check that out at that distance. Stronger force or weaker force, weaker in fact only one or one and a half or something like that. Lines of forests are going through that. Now how does it depend on distance, the number of lines going through this standard length line, the blue one? Well you see that in flat land, we're just doing this in two dimensions. We'll get to three in just a second. In flatland in two dimensions, the circumference through which all of these lines of forest pass, the length of the circumference is proportional to the radius, right? So if you go out twice as far, there's twice the circumference. So the density of lines passing through it is half as big. Everybody got that? Okay, so that means the forest, which is proportional to the line density must be proportional to one over R.

Speaker 4:          26:28          Okay.

Speaker 1:          26:31          So then as you move out twice, there'll be half as many lines move out three times a third as many lines. Okay, but this is just in two dimensions. Now let's think about how's it going to be different in three dimensions?

Speaker 4:          26:46          Kaitlin,

Speaker 1:          26:49          speak up a little bit. I buy or hearing isn't so great. I said I wanted my 50th high school reunion. Right?

Speaker 4:          26:54          Set up a line. It would be more,

Speaker 1:          26:58          yeah, it'd be. It would be a two dimensional area that the stuff's going to be. Now how if you have a certain number of lines passing through at a certain distance and you go out twice as far how, what's the density? The line's going to be. Can you think?

Speaker 4:          27:12          Anybody help? Yes. That'll be inverse square,

Speaker 1:          27:17          inverse square, because now we're not talking about the circumference of a circle. We're talking about the area of a sphere as we go out, right? So if we go to three dimensions here and take your area and move it out, it's got the surface is going to be proportional to our square as you go out. So the line density is going to be one over r square. So if you have an inverse square force law, then you can draw lines of force. The lines of force won't work if you don't have an inverse square forest law because they have to drop off this way in order to, uh, in order to give, uh, lines of force. So in three d such diagrams work only for inverse square forces. You can't draw thing like that for a Hooke's law.

Speaker 4:          28:06          Okay?

Speaker 1:          28:08          Right now. So here's a whole bunch of charges, positive and negative in the lines of force between them, right? And notice something interesting. The lines of force start on positive charges and, and on negative charges, there's no other place in space where all the lines go away from it or go toward it. Everybody see that it's only at the charges that they all go away or all go toward,

Speaker 4:          28:38          right.

Speaker 1:          28:39          And that has a very important meaning that you can't have, uh, some place, often free space where all the lines of force, we're converge. Notice if you were to have something that was positively charged, right? And it's at a minimum of energy than any place you displace it. It'll get pushed back, right? If it's at the lowest point in energy, you push it any direction that'll come back. That is all the lines of force must converge on that point. Okay. Everybody with me on that, but it can't be the only place that all the lines of force converge is on a negative charge. It can't be any place in. If you have inverse square laws, you can't have some place in space, which is the lowest energy place for the charge to be except on another charge. The same is true of, you can't have a maximum either.

Speaker 1:          29:33          That's that's a visualization of Earnshaw is therapy. So if you have inverse square forest laws or any combination of inverse square force laws, like a combination of gravity and electrostatics, then magnetic. You can't get a minimum energy structure unless everything just falls together or blows apart. Okay, so we're gonna chose theorem in systems governed by inverse square forest laws. There can be no local maximum or minimum of potential energy in free space. Okay. Now. Does everyone do that then? That's why I don't just float here. Right. I have to be on the floor. All right. Did you ever see anything truly levitating?

Speaker 4:          30:19          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          30:20          Something that just sits in space and doesn't move, not touching. Anything else that's been levitated Ian for 10 or 15 years. It's not plugged into anything. It's just this thing right here.

Speaker 4:          30:44          Right.

Speaker 1:          30:44          What do you conclude from seeing that about the forest laws that are involved? There must be some force involved in that. That's not an inverse square force law. Otherwise it wouldn't work. Okay. Now it's not our best. If you can read about it on the web if you want to. It's not the business of this class. There is a non inverse square force law involved in that little magnet sitting there.

Speaker 4:          31:09          Okay.

Speaker 1:          31:12          Uh, the only stationary points allowed by Earnshaw is they are immersed saddled points where you move, wonder it where it's, it's, it's flat in energy for all directions, but you go one direction, then you go down, you go the other direction, you go up. That's like a potato chip or saddle. So you can have saddled points. But you can't have absolute minimum or maximum of energy. There's the picture of that thing. Uh, let me, let me do the, uh, this reminds me to get back to seeing who's here. I'll call the people who weren't here earlier. Anthony Anderson. Uh, that, where are you? There you go. Alright. Uh, Maria Baruch Java. Is it, is that how you say your name? Bureau? Cova. Okay, good. Uh, Sebastian colleary colleary is that in the Italian name? Do you know what that says? You know what? It's, it's a sort of upon like thing, you know what Galileo is supposed to have said after the inquisition and still it moves a poor war movie, but this is, and still it stands there despite or in Shaw. So there's a little joke there. Okay. A young Cho. Okay. Uh, Ryan daily. Yeah. Good. Uh, let's see. Let's put this here. Uh, Chris ally saw you come in, uh, John Greenwald. Ah, Gotcha.

Speaker 3:          32:53          Uh,

Speaker 1:          32:55          oh, being a bulk way. How do you say your name? Okay, good. Uh, Serena ire.

Speaker 4:          33:02          No. Ginger Jang? No.

Speaker 3:          33:07          Uh,

Speaker 4:          33:10          Genu Lynn? No. Uh, Ben Leo here.

Speaker 3:          33:21          Uh,

Speaker 1:          33:23          Maxima. Kaylee mchaley Macaulay. Macaulay, is that originally a Scottish name?

Speaker 4:          33:30          Cutting.

Speaker 1:          33:34          They're, they're Polish names that are mixed. Some, you know, like an ice McBride. I'm interested in it. They're, they're uh, Catholics from Scotland after the reformation fled to Poland. Is there Poland names that are Scottish? Actually like McCawley McCawley would be such a thing but it's not. It's Italian. Okay. Kelly. Thank you. Uh, Jackie perilla there Ar uh, Ryan Park.

Speaker 4:          34:01          Gotcha.

Speaker 1:          34:03          Uh, Angela, she is it Shay? She HSA. What

Speaker 4:          34:08          she

Speaker 1:          34:12          okay. Devin Smith. Yeah. Uh, Naomi Woo. Yeah. Gotcha. Uh, South Yang.

Speaker 4:          34:26          Good. And Kevin? John? Nope. Good. We're getting there. And Sherry Jo now, how do you say your last name? Joe. Joe Zo. Zo Good. Right on Zo.

Speaker 1:          34:52          Okay, great. And is there ever been a buddy been able to sign up for lab that so far? If not, you can talk to talk to across the hall after the class. I don't have, don't send me anything that has to do with labs cause I'm not involved in it. Okay, great. Thanks. Now we'll continue. You've got a few more minutes here and yet it stands still. So there's must be something that's not an inverse square force law there. Okay. So Jay Jay Thompson in 1897 discovered the electron. So the idea is maybe electrons have something to do with bonds. You know, that's what, that's what brought Louis into the game. But Thompson himself came up with what was came to be called and I don't know by who first. I've tried to find out in camp the plum pudding. Adam, has anyone ever heard of that? Yeah. Okay. And I suspect that when people told you about the plum pudding out them, they sort of snickered.

Speaker 1:          35:49          Am I right that this was sort of a naive idea? It's not that naive at all. Let me show you what, here's, here's the book by uh, by uh, Jj Thomson called the corpuscular theory of matter. And if you look in there, you'll find out what he's talking about. He says he has a model of electron configuration. He says, consider the problem of how to arrange one, two, three, up to end core puzzles. That's what he called electrons. He called them core puzzles. Consider the problem as to how they would arrange themselves if placed in a sphere filled with positive electron, the positive electricity of uniform density. So that's the idea that plum pudding, you have this, this sphere of uniform positive density. Why it should be that that is not, nobody knows. But suppose you have a sphere and you put the electrons in it like plums in a plum pudding, which is like a fruitcake and England. Okay. Okay. Now notice that he said placed in a sphere filled with positive electricity. Why did he do that? Why didn't he just have like Ruth Rutherford all? We did a nucleus. Which positive charge in electrons around them about why did he put the electrons inside the positive charge? Zach, I can't hear very well.

Speaker 3:          37:16          No, yes,

Speaker 1:          37:21          no, no. They weren't thinking about things moving. They want him just sitting there.

Speaker 3:          37:30          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:32          Yeah, but that's well known. Cool. Ohms law. Yeah. Keith. Kevin, right?

Speaker 3:          37:38          A positive spirit.

Speaker 1:          37:47          Yeah, but that, that could be, if it didn't, it wouldn't have to be a big sphere of uniform density. You could have a little particle of, of, of positive charge of the same charge. Right. It'd be the same deal. Yeah. No, none of this is it. It's what we've just been talking about. Yeah. Claire Accounting for the bonding between the electrons and the protons contained, no bonding hasn't come up yet. This is something very fundamental. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          38:19          Pudding.

Speaker 1:          38:21          He probably liked plum pudding at Christmas. Yeah. Probably hit here. Did he have experiment?

Speaker 3:          38:27          No. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          38:33          Ah. Earnshaw you can't have an energy minimum for separate particles. But if you put the negative ones inside the positive one, then you can get a stable structure. It's Earnshaw is there of that required it to be a plum pudding. Okay. Now why a sphere? Why not a donut or a or some other shape of barbell or something? Right. And he said their district, that the positive charge is distributed in a way most amenable to mathematical calculation. He chose a sphere. So it would be simple. You know, if you've heard about spherical cows and so on like that, that physicists like to calculate, let's suppose there's a cow, let it be a sphere. Right? So that's what he did. That's why the, it's a sphere. Okay. We can solve the special case where the core puzzles are confined to a plane. If you could do it in two dimensions, it's difficult mathematically in three dimensions, but you can do it in two dimensions.

Speaker 1:          39:35          And he gives a picture in this book, right? Like this, which is a solenoid magnet that attracts little needles that are magnetized. And those needles are stuck into corks, which float in the water, right? So they have to, the corks have to stay at the level of the surface of the water. So it's a two dimensional problem. The needles are parallel to magnets, so they repel one another, but the big magnet attracts them to the center. Okay? So what he does is toss a certain number of needles in corks in there and see what pattern they form.

Speaker 1:          40:11          Okay. So here are some patterns. You can get these on the webs at Greg Blinders website here. So if you have just one, it goes to the center. No big deal. If you have to, you get a line, there's no big deal about that. Three make an equal lateral triangle put in for, they make a square, put in five. You make a Pentagon. No one's surprised so far, I suspect, except that sometimes when you put in Vive and shake it up, you get a square with one in the middle. Can you see where this might be going?

Speaker 4:          40:44          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          40:45          let's keep going. I'll say, okay. If you put in six you get one inside of Pentagon, seven one inside a hexagon, eight one inside a Hep to God, nine two inside, 10 to inside. And sometimes it's like that. And sometimes it's like that. These are experimental,

Speaker 4:          41:10          right?

Speaker 1:          41:12          And if you put 11 it's three inside and then three inside nine, although sometimes you get to, pardon me, I, I'm screwing up here. Sometimes you get, there are two different patterns. Sometimes you get three inside eights on as you get to inside nine. Okay. For that number. Okay. And then you get four inside, nine, four inside, five inside 10 and then after five, if you put in more, if you put in 16 you get one inside five inside 10 what does this remind you of? Yeah. The shell structure of atoms, right? As you go down the periodic table, you complete a shell. So it's a model of shells, right? And then you can get, uh, more and more and more. Okay. So this is what Thompson was thinking about, but that's just two dimensions, right? Three dimensions is a bigger problem, but he could say he was able to say something mathematically about eight.

Speaker 1:          42:13          The equilibrium of eight core puzzles at the corners of a cube is unstable even if you have this vertical charge. So it's not exactly Earnshaw. Still, you can't get eight at the corners of a cube. Now, Louis came, comes along, and in 1923, as I told you before, he writes, I have ever since regarded the cubic octet as representing essentially the arrangement of electrons in the atom. This is long after, uh, Thompson had written this about not being able to do that. So was Louis ignorant of earn Shaw's Theorem? Because by 1923, they know that the nucleus is not a plum pudding. The, that is the positive spear that it's a point,

Speaker 4:          43:00          right?

Speaker 1:          43:01          So was Louis just naive? No. Look what he wrote in 1916 the electric forces between particles which are very close together do not obey the simple laws of inverse squares, which holds at greater distances. So cool ohms law breaks down. You don't have inverse square, so then you don't have earned Shaw's therapy and you don't have to worry and you couldn't get a structure if it's not an inverse square force law, no trouble. But what is the forest law? Well, Thomson thought the same thing in 1923 in his book, the electron on chemistry, he wrote if electron nuclear attraction, we're to very strictly as the inverse square, we know by Earnshaw is there and that no stable configuration is possible with the electrons at rest are oscillating about positions of equilibrium. I shall assume that the law of force between a positive charge and an electron is expressed by this equation.

Speaker 1:          43:58          Then a number of electrons can be in equilibrium about a positive charge without necessarily describing orbits around it. And look at the, we're going to end right now by looking at this equation. What's that bit of it? The first bit, the one part that's cool. Ohms law. He's got a correction to cool ohms law here at the end, c over r where C is a distance, you divided by r and you get a number and see as a distance that's on the scale of atomic lengths, right? And that, that as long as C is, is, is very small, uh, per partner as long as, uh, uh, I said, what if I got this right? Okay. So when distance are gets smaller than C, then the force changes sign.

Speaker 4:          44:50          Okay?

Speaker 1:          44:51          So what was attractive becomes repulsive. And then you can have the electrons sitting around the nucleus.

Speaker 4:          44:56          Okay?

Speaker 1:          44:58          So we'll see what happened three years later. Next time.
