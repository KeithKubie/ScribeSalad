00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.990
 More than 10 million sport-related injuries occur every year. To prevent this, 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.869
 both athletes and coaches use a number of warming-up exercises 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.990
 to prevent injuries and improve performance. But what does science say about stretching 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.949
 and warm up? 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.820
 Many studies have looked at how racks affect sports performance and it appears that ... 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.090
 it depends on the activity! Sports such as figure skating and snowboarding, 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.730
 who must be able to make many different movements for a good assessment, will certainly benefit from it 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.890
 to be flexible. But for strength sports such as skating and bobsleigh, too much can stretch 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.070
 even lead to a temporary decrease in muscle strength. The overloaded muscle 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.829
 becomes less taxable and can remain weakened for 30 minutes. 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.989
 Although athletics competitions can be tiring, there is little evidence to claim that stretch 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.719
 reduces muscle pain before or after a competition. Some studies have even found that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.640
 Extreme flexibility can lead to an enlargement of the area where you can stretch painlessly. 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.700
 If you cannot feel the pain, the body does not know when you can go no further, and therefore 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.719
 injuries can occur. Another major study of athletes showed that the least flexible and the most flexible participants 

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:10.990
 2.5 times as likely to have an injury. So when it comes to flexibility in competitive sport, 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.820
 moderately flexible are optimal. 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.640
 A good warm-up is also very beneficial. The term itself comes from the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.680
 positive effects of raising the temperature of your body before a competition. 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.450
 Slowly increasing physical intensity prior to a sport increases muscle temperature, thereby ultimately 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.100
 tighten your muscles. More powerful contractions means more power 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.390
 and power. In addition, slowly moving more and more opens the blood vessels, 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.009
 allowing blood to flow faster throughout the body, and it reduces the effort of the heart 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.100
 Finally, as the blood temperature increases, your blood cells hold 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.829
 less oxygen. This loose oxygen can then be used by the muscles, and so it becomes 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:48.909
 increased endurance. 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.869
 Science says it's important not to stretch, in terms of flexibility, but physically 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.800
 Warming up the body for each specific sport might help 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.600
 to win the competition. 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.300
 Don't forget: we have a new video every day during the Olympic Games. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.300
 Can't you wait? Our wonderful colleagues from the CBC already have five videos to watch in one go. 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 Go to cbc.ca/olympics/ScienceSays to view them first. The link is in the description. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.300
 But we also want to know your questions for this special series. Use the hashtag #ScienceSays and let us know what your burning Olympic questions are.
