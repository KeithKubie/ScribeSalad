1
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:03,230
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

2016 and I know,

4
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:13,360
I always make that joke like, oh
my God, where is the year going?

5
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:16,600
But seriously guys, seriously,

But getting ready for the
summer. Um, and the meg,

8
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:28,783
I'm psyched.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,690
I'm psyched that we're into may cause
may means we're closer to the middle of

10
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:36,950
July and in the middle of the Jill of
July I will be done writing, you know,

12
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,330
Not really,
but sort of and uh,

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,060
I'll have two weeks off
and then I'll freckles.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,980
Rumor has it is going to be doing a,
doing a nice run through Europe. So,

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,450
uh, which you might may or
may not start in Ireland.

16
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,880
It's all a sort of loose at this point.
But uh,

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,350
we're slugging it out and um, I'm
actually feeling much better by the way.

18
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:11,280
Thank you for not asking with
my Psi Attica. Sayada can,

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,030
it sounds like a fucking speed metal band,
you know, not a good one though, right?

20
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,760
Come see my band cy Attica.

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,010
We're going to be down at the
ground round on a Wednesday night.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,280
Okay. Yeah, I'll definitely
see it. All right,

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,130
so like you think maybe you could
like bring some people, hey, you know,

24
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,370
I'm going to do what I can. All right, so
is that like, I definitely put you down

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:37,480
dude. Fuck off. I'm, I'll, I'll, if I
get there, I'll get there. All right bro.

26
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:41,830
Chill. Um, Shai Attica. I'm sorry.

27
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:47,530
I actually, I got some, I found some new
stretches. I found this fucking guy on a,

28
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,950
on youtube, this doctor who
is just sitting on a yoga mat,

29
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,830
one of these fucking new agey guys,
you know what I mean?

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,770
One of those guys that's like straight,
but we're still makes you uncomfortable.

31
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:02,590
You know those, you know those
straight guys? Like it's straight up.

32
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,690
Gay Guy is not uncomfortable to be around,

33
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,500
but there's a certain kind of straight
guy that's coming off like he's gay,

34
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:11,950
but he's straight. That is the most
uncomfortable male to be around.

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,560
I don't know why.
You know what I mean?

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,370
It's almost like they got in between the
teeth and you just can't even hear what

37
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,660
the fuck they're saying.
Do you want to be like,

38
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:23,680
could you just go and get the fuck
Outta here so I can listen to you?

39
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,990
Is there a word for that?
The Gay Straight Guy.

40
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,660
Um, yeah, Bill, it's called the gay
guy in clock in, in the, in the closet.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,610
Well maybe it isn't some, some guys are
just, uh, some guys are just a feminine.

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,030
Yeah.

43
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:43,260
Some guys just stand there and gym
classes. One person after another,

44
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,030
yeah.

45
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,340
Is called to be on the team
or to stereotype. Right.

46
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,520
This gay athletes was
that guy who played on a,

47
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,930
the big 12 there in Missouri
and then he went to a,

48
00:02:54,931 --> 00:02:58,020
that football team and then he got cut.
There must have been hard to cut him.

49
00:02:58,021 --> 00:03:00,250
Right. All right. How bad is this guy?

50
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,480
You have to suck before we
won't get accused of being
homophobic when we kind of,

51
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,470
you know, that's always in the air, but
that's not what I wanted to talk about.

52
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,520
I'm here to talk about siren at Chi,
but Worcester Centrum,

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,060
um, turns out my hamstring was fucked up
so I was doing like the touch your toe

54
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:19,601
stretches,

55
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:24,030
which is the exact opposite thing that
you want to do because the nerve is like

56
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,850
pinched or inflamed and you're
just like, you're, you're,

57
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,760
you're not stretching it out. It, I
guess you stretch the muscles really,

58
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:34,150
so whatever. And usually yet, I don't
know, stretches around the nerve.

59
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,433
I have no idea.

60
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:39,730
I'd never even heard of this fucking
thing until I had this problem and God

61
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:43,690
knows I didn't take any
anatomy classes. So, um,

62
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,230
I think when you don't have a nerve issue,
you can then do that Ben. Cause well,

63
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,150
what you're stretching really is
just your muscle, your muscle fiber,

64
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,450
the muscle tissue.
Um,

65
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,010
and the nerves are just
sort of chilling around it.

66
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:57,410
But when it gets pinched between the,

67
00:03:57,411 --> 00:04:02,310
the fucking interior crucial ligament of
the lower fucking vertebrate tailbone,

68
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,020
whatever the fuck it is all
in, I was like, fuck it.
Fucking pulling a balloon. Um,

69
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,560
uninflated balloon.
I have no fucking analogy.

70
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,990
I don't know what Ellie
I know is it hurts.

71
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:16,200
So I put this guy on this hippy
guy and he was just like, yeah man,

72
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,980
what's she actually want
to do is you don't they,

73
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,030
there's certain stretches did you want,

74
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:25,650
did you and your certain stretches
that you don't want to do and you know,

75
00:04:25,651 --> 00:04:28,500
we're in an age right now.
It's, I'm so fucking impatient.

76
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:32,580
I was trying to skip ahead by
just had to sit there, you know,

77
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,430
everything I could do just to
get through a nine minute video.

78
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:37,980
It's only nine minutes out of my day,

79
00:04:37,981 --> 00:04:42,870
but there's like a flat screen TV
with NBA and Nhl playoffs going on.

80
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,330
I got other videos I can click on.
You know,

81
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,390
as I'm sitting there trying
to listen to this guy,

82
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,980
I'm also looking at all the videos on
the right, you know, there's free porn,

83
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,870
there's all kinds of shit in this guy is
just sitting there going, you know, okay,

84
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,720
could, could stretch it. You
want to do is is actually,

85
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:03,510
if you should sit down on your buttocks,

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,040
make sure your weight is on your,
your pelvic bones. And it was just,

87
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:09,780
it was driving me fucking insane,
but whatever.

88
00:05:09,781 --> 00:05:12,870
I ended up doing the stretches and I,
and I definitely feel better. So, um,

89
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,400
thanks to that guy,

90
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:17,670
whatever his fucking name is and I will
definitely be posting those in case

91
00:05:17,671 --> 00:05:19,650
anybody else has that problem.

92
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,760
If you just sitting down in a chair
and like your feet go numb and shit,

93
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,350
you could possibly have what I have.

94
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,820
Oh, you got a big dog sitting
in your lap, one or the other.

95
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:36,680
I have no fucking idea, but I'm just
happy that it, uh, that it feels better.

96
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,760
And um, I got to tell you all these
fucking aches and pains that I'm having.

97
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,620
I knew this a long time ago.

98
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,610
There's nothing better than stretching
now that I've gone out and I bought all

99
00:05:46,611 --> 00:05:51,020
this fucking rogue fitness
shit. Um, you know,

100
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:56,021
to lift weights and all the atomic grips
and all that shit to do the a Ninja

101
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:59,330
warrior stuff. The best thing
I could be doing all that shit.

102
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,650
That shit's all gonna be great.
Provided I fucking stretch. But, um,

103
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,850
I dunno. I wish I knew way, way, way,

104
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:11,240
way fucking back in the day to stretch.

105
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:16,370
There was no stretching in the 80s
he went to Gold's gym.

106
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,470
You just did the old,

107
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,890
you know you did the stretch you did
before you started lifting and Gold's gym

108
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:25,790
back in the 80s you remember fucking
Chevy Chase when he's about ready to jump

109
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,120
in the pool of Christie Brinkley where
he's going. This is crazy. This is crazy.

110
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,520
This is crazy. You know he's moving
his fucking, that's what you did.

111
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:34,280
You did a couple of those
and then he did like,

112
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:37,910
you stuck your arm to the side and
you did those fucking, you know,

113
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:41,840
touch your left hand or your right
toe and up and down, you know,

114
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:46,630
one to fucking those military things.
One,

115
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,480
two, three, four. Ah, Love
Marine Corp you do on that shit,

116
00:06:50,481 --> 00:06:53,210
right without stretching and then
you would just fucking work out.

117
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,010
I fucked up myself so much. Fucked up my
tricep. I tore a peck, you know, you know,

118
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:58,341
it's funny.

119
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:01,130
All of this shit's going to come back
to haunt me the next time I lose my

120
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:01,731
fucking eye.

121
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:05,090
Health insurance is someone just listening
to this podcast and list everything

122
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,460
that I'm talking about is some
sort of preexisting condition.

123
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,793
MMM.

124
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:12,750
You know, you probably go
home, Bill, you're doing well.

125
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,430
How do you keep losing your
health insurance? Well,

126
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,810
because you'd do an acting gig.

127
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,710
They pay you one time and then they start
sending your residual checks for like

128
00:07:19,711 --> 00:07:24,711
a dollar 35 and you have to make 10
grand a year minimum to keep your,

129
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,850
uh, every single year.
You've got to make it.

130
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,990
You got to make that or something like
that to keep your fucking sag after

131
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:34,200
fucking health insurance.
And uh, you know,

132
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:37,800
if one year goes by and
you're writing a show,

133
00:07:37,801 --> 00:07:41,640
rather than being on the show, you fucking
lose your a, you end up losing. I mean,

134
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:42,810
I do anyways.
I haven't done it

135
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,850
enough. Uh, you know,

136
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:48,260
I haven't done enough act
work, I guess. You know,

137
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:50,690
you'd think with 58 fast and furious,

138
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,720
47 Friday the 13th you'd think I could
catch on enough to make 10 grand a year.

139
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,480
You know what? I'm blaming the fuck it
after. Sag Health, health insurance.

140
00:08:02,481 --> 00:08:05,060
I think I got to take this. Why?
I've gotta take this one myself.

141
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,120
I got to look myself in the fucking
mirror and be like, you know what bill?

142
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,280
It's your goddamn faults.
Your own fucking fault.

143
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,530
Not you just go out and
get blue cross blue shield.

144
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,150
That's what I should do and I should
just walk away from sag after. Right.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,340
I don't fucking know. I'm a
big advocate of that. You know,

146
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,920
looking yourself in the mirror and
being like, all right, you fucked up.

147
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,070
As opposed to being like, you
know, the world is unfair,

148
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:32,060
which everybody knows it is.
Right. But if you say, all right,

149
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,370
I fucked up and it actually
gives you an option to be, okay,

150
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:37,730
what can I do to lessen the fuck up?
Because I know I'm going to fuck up again.

151
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,650
You know, like if you're like
Caitlyn Jenner right now,

152
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,450
rather than fucking filming yourself
taking a Piss and Trump's tower, you know,

153
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,060
why don't you just look yourself in
the mirror and be like, all right,

154
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:53,960
how did I fuck this up? You know,
for the first 66 years of my life,

155
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,600
I had a definitive bathroom to go into.
There wasn't any questions,

156
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:01,110
nor did I have to fill myself. And then
afterwards say, I didn't molest anybody.

157
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,240
What has happened to that person?
You know, that, that, that,

158
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,440
that person is absolutely
lost their fucking mind.

159
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,230
Who's walking around filming themselves,

160
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:14,690
taking a Piss and then
talking about child molesters.

161
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,190
And I know what people were saying,
Oh,

162
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:20,720
you can't have these fucking a
former guys with boobs now they have,

163
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,350
you know,
if you know that transitioning people,

164
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,030
they'd get a fucking molests somebody,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

165
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,970
I know that that's what that whole
fucking thing was supposed to be about.

166
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:31,900
But you know,
I dunno,

167
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,320
that just came off to me is
shameless self promotion.

168
00:09:35,321 --> 00:09:38,530
I don't have anything against
transgendered people, but
that's fucking Ding Bat.

169
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:44,620
It's funny, you see the big bet is
the proper word because you know,

170
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:49,650
she identifies with the female sex of I
think ding bet now works as opposed to

171
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:56,200
Douche bags. See, I kept the
D, I went, I went alliteration
ice kid. Never fully see.

172
00:09:56,201 --> 00:09:56,801
You know what?
I,

173
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:01,540
I would never call Bruce a douche
bag cause he was on the Wheaties box.

174
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,320
You know, I don't know about this Katelyn
though. That's the jury's still out.

175
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,820
Oh Bruce did kill somebody.
You don't accidentally,

176
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,530
Caitlin has yet to accidentally
killed somebody. So you know,

177
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:17,890
there's a lot of mass to be done. You
know what? I strike all that, I think.

178
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:21,070
I think, uh, she was right to film
yourself peeing in a skyscraper.

179
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:23,643
Okay.

180
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,050
You know,
whenever I see a video like that,

181
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:29,900
I always wonder if people who are
truly suffering around the world,

182
00:10:29,901 --> 00:10:34,400
if they ever get access to a laptop
and just somehow that comes up on their

183
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,110
fucking youtube page,
you know what I mean?

184
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,730
They're just living like in like those
people that like Brazil that live in

185
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:44,580
those fucking trash heaps.
If somehow they see fucking

186
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,080
Caitlyn Jenner walking around
acting like a victim, you know,

187
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,400
wearing shoes that they probably fucking
sewed together at three o'clock in the

188
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:54,120
fucking room

189
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,953
morning.

190
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:03,690
Oh, I know. I know. You're supposed
to care about everything. Um,

191
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,070
I don't, I don't give a fuck. You know
what I give a shit about right now?

192
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:11,720
Cheyenne? Anika calming
to the Providence. Oh,

193
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,500
so Wurster providence civic
center. Wooster Civic Center. No.

194
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,240
Okay.

195
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,940
Ah, fuck. I can't even remember.
That's all I give a shit about.

196
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:24,410
I give a shit about, um, I don't know,

197
00:11:24,411 --> 00:11:27,410
being able to fucking reach
down and pick up a dirty sock.

198
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:31,160
Don't have enough fucking bolt of
lightning. Go down the back of my leg.

199
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:34,980
That would be nice. Right.
Maybe I'm transitioning,

200
00:11:34,981 --> 00:11:39,000
I'm transitioning into a fucking old
man right before my very eyes, you know,

201
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:43,340
my fucking dog has just been, he just
sleeps all damn day. It's unreal. I know.

202
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,870
I always bring this shit up,
but it just blows me away.

203
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:52,960
I want you around the block.
That's it. It's all there was.

204
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,470
Um, anyways, so I've been
watching as much as I can. Um,

205
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,420
my wife's been on the road so I,
uh, I immediately become a, a,

206
00:12:04,421 --> 00:12:08,590
a bachelor. However, I've kept
this place pretty clean, you know,

207
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:12,700
and that's a very important thing to do
when you're married is when your spouse

208
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:17,230
leaves, you have to fucking show
them that you can live without them.

209
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,390
I think that's a huge fucking thing.

210
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:23,380
Like she so wants to come home and just
see this fucking place in absolute like

211
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:28,030
see that you couldn't live without me.
You know what I mean? Which I couldn't,

212
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,730
I would be fucking devastated
if she fucking left or anything.

213
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,560
Obviously I would be,
but you know what I mean?

214
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,140
You do have to have a
little bit of self esteem.

215
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:40,720
So I've gone back to the way I used
to live. Like I have one plate,

216
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:41,470
one fork,

217
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,470
that's all I'm music and I just put it
in the sink and if I need another one,

218
00:12:44,471 --> 00:12:48,100
I just watched that one. That's
great. It's nice and quick.

219
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:51,160
Saves a lot of water.
Right?

220
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,310
Ed Begley Jr would be so fucking happy
with me right now. One plate, one fork.

221
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,900
I'm really into that type of shit.

222
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,420
And that's very hard to be into
that type of shit when, uh,

223
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:04,840
when you have a woman in your life,
you know, not having a lot of stuff

224
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,520
because, uh, bitches be like and stuff.

225
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,230
I don't know what it is.
They can't get enough for fucking Amazon.

226
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,470
I wonder what percentage of people,
and you know, this sub fucking guy,

227
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:22,020
but that doctor did a feminine straight
doctor that helped me with Sayada.

228
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Um, I bet he's on Amazon
all the time, you know,

229
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:29,330
trying to find a new pair of
fucking puffy pants to sandals. I'm,

230
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,170
isn't it amazing that this guy
helped me out the way he did?

231
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:35,590
And I'm so fucking damage to the human
as a human being that I still have to

232
00:13:35,591 --> 00:13:36,424
make fun of him.

233
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,013
MMM.

234
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,820
And well, you know, what would
you want from me? So anyways,

235
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,670
the update with the gym.
All right,

236
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,840
I'll actually show you guys before
and after pictures when, uh,

237
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,470
when I'm done because, uh,
it's just a fucking garage.

238
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:57,650
I don't give a shit if you see that.
So I got the pegboard up.

239
00:13:59,290 --> 00:13:59,930
MMM.

240
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,630
I actually, what I had before
was, you know, those, um,

241
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:05,840
you know those really long pegboards
where your arms are really close together

242
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:07,510
and they're like,
they go on for fucking ever.

243
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:09,853
MMM.

244
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:13,010
You know, my garage, you know, he has
like a fucking eight foot ceilings,

245
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:16,200
so that wasn't an option. So I bought
two of those and mounted them sideways.

246
00:14:16,201 --> 00:14:20,190
So I used to just,
just do the pegboard exercise sideways.

247
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:23,100
You don't try to go all the way
down and then come all the way back.

248
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,010
And I'm now where they moved him,

249
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,370
they actually cut them in half
and put all four side by side.

250
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,970
So the goal is eventually
to go up one down the other,

251
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:37,440
up the third and down the fourth. I
got that up, I got the speed bag up.

252
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:41,200
Uh, that's more for my wife.
She's into that shit. Um,

253
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,300
I don't give a fuck about
that. You know, that's always,

254
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,360
that was a big thing when I was growing
up, having a heavy bag and all that shit,

255
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:49,620
you know?

256
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,710
And then people thought they were tougher
because they were hitting the heavy

257
00:14:51,711 --> 00:14:55,460
bag that has no fucking arms or legs.
You know, you basically just, you,

258
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,570
you beaten up,
you know,

259
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:00,980
you basically practicing to
fight a cripple is all you
are really doing. I mean,

260
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:03,350
granted there was cardio involved,

261
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:07,730
but actually I remember a long time
ago seeing a fucking guy with no arms,

262
00:15:07,731 --> 00:15:12,460
no legs as a wrestler and nobody
could beat him. They just,

263
00:15:12,461 --> 00:15:14,790
there was nothing to hook and
he and he would just do it.

264
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:18,100
I don't know what he was doing, but he
would somehow flip these. It was like,

265
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:21,820
can you just imagine wrestling
just a rock, you know?

266
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:26,410
But it was a long flat one and
somehow it fucking could move.

267
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,120
I don't know.
And it had a head on it.

268
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,150
I don't know how to describe this fucking
kid. All I know is he was winning.

269
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:36,930
So maybe, maybe there is something about
that. You know, what, can I backtrack?

270
00:15:36,931 --> 00:15:40,320
I don't think I've had one at one point
that I've made in this entire podcast

271
00:15:40,321 --> 00:15:43,590
that I haven't, I haven't
retracted from, well you know what,

272
00:15:43,591 --> 00:15:44,940
it's a fucking election year.

273
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,033
MMM.

274
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:51,900
What's the guy was, who was the other
guy run other than Donald Trump?

275
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,900
Hillary Clinton. Kidding.
Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz. I don't
know anything about Ted Cruz,

276
00:15:58,901 --> 00:16:02,800
but evidently he's really interested
about where Caitlin Jenner drops a fucking

277
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:07,300
deuce and Caitlyn made a fucking oh,
snapchat fucking video of right.

278
00:16:07,301 --> 00:16:10,540
Is that what happened? Is that what
happened on fucking Facebook this week?

279
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm so out of the loop.
Everybody so out of the loop.

280
00:16:15,341 --> 00:16:19,930
Just can you guys just ride with me for
the next couple of fucking months as I

281
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:22,690
spend my entire waking hours
in a fucking writer's room.

282
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,390
I don't fucking see anything.
I don't read anything.

283
00:16:25,391 --> 00:16:26,920
We just stare at a computer screen.

284
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,950
I'm going to need fucking glasses
by the time I'm done with this shit.

285
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:32,170
My Act is drying up.
Thank you.

286
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:34,120
Know what I'm sitting is
shitting on Caitlyn Jenner.

287
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,200
Thank God she fucking made that video
cause I ended up getting a great bit out

288
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:42,490
of it this weekend. I fucked
it up the first time. Um,

289
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,730
and then the next time
it, it, uh, it worked. So,

290
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,343
uh,

291
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,830
that's always great. You know,
you gotta Love Topical Material.

292
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:54,330
Topical material is like the Doritos of
fucking stand up. You know what I mean?

293
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,000
It's fucking,
it's so fucking satisfying.

294
00:16:57,001 --> 00:17:00,630
But there's just no
nutrition in it whatsoever.

295
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,913
MMM.

296
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,870
But anyways, like I was saying
before, I went down to the, the, uh,

297
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,830
the comedy store and Doodie Kenny,

298
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,620
I can't fucking believe it
looks like a Goddamn nightclub.

299
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,810
There's all these young people in there,

300
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:19,680
there's beautiful women all dressed
up and shit. Just having a great time.

301
00:17:19,681 --> 00:17:24,510
Like it's like, I don't know, I wasn't
around during the 80s, but I don't know.

302
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:30,020
Um, I dunno how it could have been any
better just as far as the sheer amount of

303
00:17:30,021 --> 00:17:32,270
people coming out in there.
And they are laughers too.

304
00:17:32,271 --> 00:17:34,010
So if you are in the La area,

305
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,153
mmm.

306
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,590
It's a good time to go down there.
And, um, I was on, you know,

307
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,320
the shows I was on was just fucking one
monster fucking comic after another.

308
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:44,880
That's probably another reason.

309
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:47,243
MMM.

310
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,930
Like one of my favorites,
I consider a new guys,

311
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,830
Chris Delea who goes down there.

312
00:17:52,831 --> 00:17:56,040
And what I love about that guy
is just as a standup comic,

313
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:00,090
I love seeing a legitimate headliner.
You know,

314
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:04,260
there's a lot of people that can sell
tickets because they're on TV or they did

315
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:08,910
a movie thing or they took a piss and
Donald Trump's fucking tower, right?

316
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,950
Caitlyn Jenner,
which sell out a fucking Improv.

317
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:15,690
But there's very few people that could
basically follow anybody go out there and

318
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:19,530
really level like the, the, the,

319
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:23,310
the point at which that you have to
level to really be considered a fucking

320
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:28,080
headliner. And, uh, this
guy fucking does it. So, um,

321
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:29,970
yeah,
man,

322
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:34,860
there was a bunch of people who the fuck
was on the show and went on up to Dane

323
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,450
Cook. He fucking murdered. Um,
I got there late on that one.

324
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:42,030
And then the next show I
was working with Chris Delea

325
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,730
and um,

326
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:51,880
Natasha Leggiero was on Bobby Lee,
by the way, speaking to Natasha.

327
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:56,770
Did anybody see the new dice clay fucking
series? I love it. Did you see age?

328
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,380
Oh my God, I'm a fuck up.
His name is Adrian Brody.

329
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,880
Why don't I know anybody's name?

330
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:07,360
He did this whole fucking thing where
he was playing himself and he was, uh,

331
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,440
you know, and in his next acting
role was to play dice clay,

332
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:15,880
Andrew dice clay in a bio pic.
So the whole episode,

333
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:19,540
he's trying to get dice that, I don't
want to ruin it, just fucking watch it.

334
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:23,620
His dice clay is his fucking tremendous.
And um,

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,620
I don't know,
speaking of the Worcester Centrum,

336
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,740
I've always been a huge
dice clay fan and I saw him,

337
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:34,750
I know I've told this story before,
but that's where I saw him in like 1988.

338
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,270
I saw him, uh, at the
Worcester Centrum, um,

339
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:45,040
with an unknown Eddie Griffin opening up.
And uh,

340
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,620
it was sick. He fucking murdered. He
did a drum solo at the end of the end.

341
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,290
It was one of the sickest
shows I ever saw. And uh,

342
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,180
I still didn't realize that I wanted to
be a comedian, so fucking dumb. I was,

343
00:19:58,181 --> 00:19:58,961
when I was growing up,
do you know,

344
00:19:58,961 --> 00:20:03,820
I used to memorize comedy albums and I
would ride around my bicycle, you know,

345
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:07,660
doing my paper route,
reciting those at those albums,

346
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:10,120
pretending I was doing them in the,

347
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,820
in the school auditorium in
front of the entire school.

348
00:20:12,821 --> 00:20:14,860
And it's still never dawned on me like,
hey bill,

349
00:20:14,861 --> 00:20:18,970
that probably means that you want
to be a comedian. Like I never,

350
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,840
it never fucking done, it seemed like
it was a million miles away. You know,

351
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,220
we didn't have youtube,

352
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,423
you know,

353
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,530
could just film yourself taking
a shit at a dairy queen and say,

354
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:34,820
take that presidential candidate that you,

355
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,920
you couldn't fucking do
that back then. Um, anyways,

356
00:20:39,910 --> 00:20:43,180
so as always I'm going to
talk about another car that
I like and that I probably

357
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:44,080
will never buy.

358
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:49,410
I was watching something on that Tesla
s and it's like the self driving fucking

359
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,480
car and these two guys computer,
look at guys,

360
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:54,130
I'll say that because
they both had glasses.

361
00:20:54,131 --> 00:20:58,090
So if you have glasses in my world that
means you're smart and a lot of people's

362
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,870
world that meets that you know, but you
know I want to be politically correct.

363
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:06,370
Maybe they were both a couple of fuck
heads but anyways they were in this car

364
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:06,880
and uh,

365
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,880
they put on the self driving mode and
according to the video they put blankets

366
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:14,050
over themselves and
they took a fucking nap.

367
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:22,280
Now Tessa said that there's some alarming
youtube videos of people doing shit in

368
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,200
their cars that you're
not supposed to be doing,

369
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,480
but they basically took a nap and then
somebody wrote in one of the comments

370
00:21:29,481 --> 00:21:34,010
underneath it like, would you get
arrested if you got shit faced,

371
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:37,100
put it on self driving mode
and then sat in the back seat.

372
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:40,000
Okay.

373
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,180
And you don't make, you don't know
me, maybe you're thinking on me,

374
00:21:43,181 --> 00:21:45,190
but I'm always bitching about technology.

375
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,750
I actually am coming around
to the self driving car.

376
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,430
Just provided that you could
still drive it if you want to. Um,

377
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:56,530
cause that is dead is pretty
fucking cool. Do you realize, wow,

378
00:21:56,531 --> 00:22:00,520
how fucking artist shape in like the,
you know,

379
00:22:00,521 --> 00:22:05,180
how bad like this is going to be
for procrastinators, you know,

380
00:22:05,181 --> 00:22:08,240
the fact that they no longer have to
drive themselves to work and they're going

381
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:12,320
to be trying to finish their fucking
presentation in their car. You know,

382
00:22:12,321 --> 00:22:15,790
you've seen people brushing their teeth
or just people literally with an eye

383
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:16,624
mask on,

384
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:21,260
just fucking sleeping in the jam
jams and then they pull up to work.

385
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,363
You know,

386
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,660
like you set your car alarm and that's
like your fucking alarm to wake you up.

387
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:30,530
Like when it stops and it's in park,
you know,

388
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,870
maybe the horn just goes bad, bad, bad.

389
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:38,990
That'd be too jarring. That'd be too
jarring for people in the future. Right.

390
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,320
They don't want to fuck a
deal with anything. They just
want to lay around. Right.

391
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,990
So they fucking let you lay
there in the car. And uh,

392
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:48,320
you know those fucking creepy
self vibrating fucking seats.

393
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:53,240
When you get too close to something,
maybe it does that you just lay in there,

394
00:22:53,241 --> 00:22:56,960
right? And it just sort of shakes you a
little bit and some weird creepy computer

395
00:22:56,961 --> 00:22:58,820
voice. She could pick
the voice too, right?

396
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,270
You don't got no celebrities
will jump all over that.

397
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,010
They do the fucking voiceovers to make
a little bit of cash because no one pays

398
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:09,950
for movies anymore. And they're just
sick of being in those mighty heroes.

399
00:23:09,951 --> 00:23:13,010
Fucking superhero movies,
one after another.

400
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:16,580
They're literally out of ideas.
I mean,

401
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:20,330
once you have like the superheroes
fighting each other that they gotta be

402
00:23:20,331 --> 00:23:23,060
nervous in Hollywood just going like,
where, where do we go from here?

403
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,213
You know,

404
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,850
can we reboot this thing again? Can we
reboot the fucking joker and all that?

405
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,210
We know what the funny thing is though,
is people will keep showing up.

406
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,780
I guess that makes sense,
right?

407
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:41,290
God knows they've had the comic books
forever and people keep reading those.

408
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:44,170
You know what, I'm, I'm taking that one
back. I'm wrong about that one again.

409
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:47,360
Have I been right?
Fuck.

410
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,580
Bunch of swings and
misses. Um, so anyways,

411
00:23:52,581 --> 00:23:57,560
that Tesla as has another feature where
you can like call the car like a fucking

412
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:01,490
dog. Like if it's in a tight
parking spot, you can just go,

413
00:24:01,491 --> 00:24:04,830
hey, Tesla, Tesla, Tesla, buddy.

414
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,490
You want to go for a
drive? Right. And, uh,

415
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,570
the thing just slowly backs up.
It comes to you. It's literally,

416
00:24:14,571 --> 00:24:18,080
it's like the fucking nitrite or car.
And like I said,

417
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:21,320
I am usually anti-technology and um,

418
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,370
but every once in a while
something comes along and I,

419
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,370
and I even meet as much as of a
fucking freckled content. I am,

420
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:32,150
I have to sit back and be like, you know
what? That's cool. So here's the thing,

421
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:35,870
the car costs like, I
don't know, like $120,000.

422
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,540
So I imagine 90% of the people,
you know,

423
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:43,370
not trying to talk down to you,
okay,

424
00:24:43,371 --> 00:24:47,960
we'll say 80% of you that listened to
this fucking thing, right? Just went like,

425
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:52,070
oh Geez, I'll never be able to afford
that. Yeah, you will. I'll tell you why.

426
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:57,230
Okay. I'll give you, I'll give you
fucking three examples. Calculators,

427
00:24:57,231 --> 00:25:01,730
rollerblades and flat screen TVs, all
of those things. When they came out,

428
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,750
they were fucking ridiculously expensive.
And then by the end of it,

429
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:08,540
they gave him away with like
a free tank of fucking gas.

430
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,310
Well maybe not the fucking flat screens,

431
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,400
but you remember like we'll go back to
California calculators first came out,

432
00:25:13,401 --> 00:25:17,900
they were a $100 each, something
crazy like that. And then they,

433
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,420
they just kept dropping,
dropping, dropping, dropping,

434
00:25:20,421 --> 00:25:23,330
dropping is more and more people bought
them and then they had the solar ones in

435
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:23,331
.

436
00:25:23,331 --> 00:25:26,540
The next thing you know you
got a calculator with the
fucking free Philip at the

437
00:25:26,541 --> 00:25:29,880
gas station. Roller blades were
always over 100 bucks, right?

438
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:31,760
And then everybody had
them and then they're like,

439
00:25:31,761 --> 00:25:33,500
well what the fuck are we going
to do with the rest of them?

440
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,590
And next thing you know,
they was 30 bucks, right?

441
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,070
Flat screen TVs when they first came out.

442
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:45,020
I F I for some reason remembered them to
be about 11 grant when they first came

443
00:25:45,021 --> 00:25:47,300
out, you know, and they were
about as thick as my fucking head.

444
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:52,610
Let me look this up here.
Original price, original price

445
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,740
of flat screen TV's.

446
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:01,440
I'm saying 11 grand for that screen.

447
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,210
Flat screen falling costs of flat screens.

448
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:11,660
Wait, a farm, Jesus Christ. I'll
never find it. Oh, the price was

449
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,540
14,090, almost 15 grand,
$999 for a plasma TV,

450
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,950
plasma display, TV, Yada,
Yada, Yada. Advantages,

451
00:26:21,951 --> 00:26:23,060
disadvantages.

452
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:27,260
Where the fuck was it history to,

453
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,830
we'll go to the two thousands,
2000,

454
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:35,300
the 40 inch TV cost. Uh, you know what?

455
00:26:35,301 --> 00:26:36,140
Go Fuck Yourself.

456
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:38,960
I don't know where the fuck or was it
actually came up and then I clicked on it

457
00:26:38,961 --> 00:26:43,950
and then the inflammation disappears.
Um, sorry about that. I'm just so,

458
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,790
I bet that the Tesla,
that technology

459
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,420
will, will, you know, it's like when
airbags first came out, they run Mercedes.

460
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:56,340
They protected the rich people first.

461
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,850
And then once they got all the rich
people's money, then they go, all right.

462
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:00,571
You know what?

463
00:27:00,571 --> 00:27:05,100
Maybe we'll protect the middle class
and then eventually it gets all the way

464
00:27:05,101 --> 00:27:07,650
down to like, you know, like
there's starving kids in Africa.

465
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,470
They probably have roller blades,
you know what I mean?

466
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:16,760
And like a Chicago Blackhawks 2016,
uh,

467
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,880
advanced to the second round
tee shirt. Right. You know,

468
00:27:19,881 --> 00:27:23,480
they always get those fucking
get those hats.

469
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,790
Like Boston Red Sox,
1986 world series champions.

470
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:32,990
It's always somebody dig in for a blood
diamond where in that shit buffalo bills

471
00:27:32,991 --> 00:27:37,460
four in a row, you know, that's like
what is sexual a tee shirt, you know,

472
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,940
sexually adwares over and fucking done
on one of those sex slave countries.

473
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,910
Are you making light of the sex
trade and no, I'm just talking.

474
00:27:46,911 --> 00:27:48,560
I'll make in front of
the buffalo bills there.

475
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,350
I feel for the person that has two
was sold into sex slavery, but I,

476
00:27:53,351 --> 00:27:57,560
I don't feel bad for the uh,
buffalo bills. You know what I mean?

477
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:03,680
You know why they lost all four of those
cause nice guys finish last and Marv

478
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,050
Levy is everything that Pete
Carroll looks like he is.

479
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:12,520
Pete Carroll is is Marv Levy 2.0 both
of them just look like you could just

480
00:28:12,521 --> 00:28:16,130
trust them. You know, I could leave, I
can leave a stack of fucking cash here,

481
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:19,600
right in front of him. My life savings, I
will come back and I'm going to be fine.

482
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,500
And, and that is true with Marv Levy
and that's why he lost four Superbowls.

483
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:27,670
Now if you were to leave that with Pete
Carroll, you know, I, I'm, you know,

484
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:29,890
I don't think I have to tell you that.
You know,

485
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:34,420
there'd be some Hooters chicks over there
and teach God wing sauce on his face

486
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:38,260
and be like, it's all there.
Fuck you talking about. Um,

487
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:41,950
why am I shitting on Pete Carroll
and what you think of bill,

488
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,370
what about your coach? What about fucking
now, what about bill Belicheck? Well,

489
00:28:45,371 --> 00:28:46,750
he doesn't look wholesome.

490
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,540
It looks like a mean dad
doesn't eat like dad's home.

491
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,170
God, he's such a Douche, you know,
that's, that's what he looks like.

492
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:03,340
Pete Carroll looks like, you know, be
carrot. Looks like he goes to church,

493
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,380
you know,
and on the third day,

494
00:29:07,381 --> 00:29:10,170
Jesus will rise again and
then he's in the back and go,

495
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:12,513
Woo,

496
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,120
that paid. He always gets excited
during that part of the Jesus Story.

497
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:22,310
Oh, JJ. Um, oh,

498
00:29:22,311 --> 00:29:24,020
what the fuck was with that guy?
You know,

499
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,740
I actually tweeted about that guy in
the draft that got busted, you know,

500
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,410
wearing in the fucking gas mass,
taking the fucking we'd hit and uh,

501
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,440
everybody gave me shit. Fuck, you
didn't watch the draft. It's like, dude,

502
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:40,890
it kind of became, it
went viral. Actually. Uh,

503
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:45,460
I was actually texted to me by a, uh,
another comedian was letting me know.

504
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:49,720
They said in real time this guy
was getting blackmailed and uh,

505
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:54,780
I ended up watching the clips do that was
that guy should fire his fucking agent

506
00:29:55,541 --> 00:29:59,170
yesterday. That poor bastard, nobody,

507
00:29:59,171 --> 00:30:03,930
he had no advice. He was sitting there
sweating. If nobody came out, it's,

508
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:07,120
that woman didn't say, hey,
that's enough. No more questions.

509
00:30:07,121 --> 00:30:08,500
If she didn't rescue him,

510
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:12,970
that guy would still be sitting
there like pouring sweat,

511
00:30:12,971 --> 00:30:15,670
answering ever every fucking
question that they asked them.

512
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,920
What's the most fucked up
thing ever jerked off to?
Well I would have to say, uh,

513
00:30:20,921 --> 00:30:24,790
you know, it's just like, I don't
know where his agent was, but um,

514
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,950
he was somewhere high
fiving himself I think. Um,

515
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,740
God dammit that Tesla's a good
looking car from the side.

516
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:36,370
I just hate the front end.
It's just weird, you know,

517
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,780
cause it doesn't need a fucking,

518
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,260
doesn't need a grill cause it doesn't
have a radiator because it doesn't have an

519
00:30:41,261 --> 00:30:45,850
engine to fucking, you
know, cool off or whatever.

520
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,220
I was going to say, well it'd be cool
if they just put it in there anyways,

521
00:30:50,221 --> 00:30:53,160
but then air would get trapped and then
it was actually slow down to that's the

522
00:30:53,161 --> 00:30:56,070
fucking car. That's the car you
want. That thing is, it's fast.

523
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:01,050
It's actually beats a fucking Lamborghini.
It beats a Ferrari zero to 60.

524
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:05,610
It fucking smokes. That car
literally smokes a fucking supercar.

525
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:09,510
Now when they get up into the higher
gears, this, you know, fucking 70,

526
00:31:09,511 --> 00:31:13,350
80 miles an hour, the Ferrari
overtakes them. Who gives a fuck?

527
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,040
Yeah.

528
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,750
Gives a fuck 80 90 miles an
hour. I mean, I guess if you,

529
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:20,920
the only reason to want a car going
that fast, if you take it to the track,

530
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,590
if you fucking drive a hundred
miles an hour on a regular streets,

531
00:31:23,591 --> 00:31:27,070
you're a fucking asshole and you're
going to kill somebody. So, um,

532
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:33,130
you know what? God dammit, I think
I'm going to get that car. Uh, Jesus.

533
00:31:33,131 --> 00:31:37,180
That's a good looking car and get it in
black. Huh? With the red fucking cow.

534
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:44,270
Nah, I'm too fucking, I'm too frugal.
Can't blow her 120,000. What are they?

535
00:31:44,271 --> 00:31:46,120
What's the fucking car payment on that?

536
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,650
It's a fucking moron.

537
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:53,890
You could buy a third of Detroit for the
amount of money you're going to pay for

538
00:31:53,891 --> 00:31:56,920
a fucking Tesla. That's insane. You know,

539
00:31:56,921 --> 00:32:00,610
I watched the trashiest fucking youtube
videos and I really have to stop doing

540
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:02,460
it because everything like I,

541
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:06,310

top 10 inappropriate police officer

542
00:32:06,311 --> 00:32:10,150
pictures posted online.
And then once you do that,

543
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:11,860
then you're just stuck in this thing.

544
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:15,160
Top 10 things banned in the United States.

545
00:32:15,161 --> 00:32:19,270
Inappropriate family photos that
will make you cringe. You know,

546
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,620
most of them are staged,

547
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,240
but you still sit there and watch at the
top 10 fucking creepy things ever dug

548
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:30,160
up. The top 10 weird things
in the background is some
Hor took a picture of her

dangerous gangs in the world. All right,

550
00:32:35,081 --> 00:32:39,530
I'll look at this guys. All fucking
tattooed up holding the baby.

551
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:42,150
As far as for sentence,

552
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,730
10 of the most dangerous
gangs in the world.

553
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,190
This is what I do when
my wife's out of town.

554
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:52,580
I watch playoff hockey
and then I have that on.

555
00:32:52,581 --> 00:32:54,560
And then I fucking sit here
and I look at this shit.

556
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:59,570
15 most poisonous animals in the world.
You know what it is?

557
00:32:59,571 --> 00:33:01,970
I've seen every fail video at this point.

558
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:06,750
I've seen every people are awesome video.
Um,

559
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,900
I've seen every fight video.

560
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,200
I've seen every instant Karma bully thing.

561
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:17,540
I, I've, I just, I just feel like I've
seen everything that I give a fuck about.

562
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:22,670
Instant Karmas fails five most
dangerous people in the world.

563
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,750
10 acts, 10 acts, 10 actors
who actually did it on screen.

564
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,090
I didn't see that.
Wait a minute.

565
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,030
What the fuck is this one c and now I'm
not going to watch the most dangerous

566
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:33,950
gangs. You know, it's funny. As much.

567
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,840
Most of you will make fun of
me right now on the other.

568
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,140
The rest of you are googling
the shit right now. Um,

569
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,080
so anyways,
uh,

570
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,340
see if I got any questions that my fucking
Andrew sent me the fucking questions

571
00:33:46,341 --> 00:33:49,850
yet cause I don't have any of the
advertising. I ain't get nothing.

572
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:53,090
I'm trying to get this shit out of the
fucking way because I got to do a radio

573
00:33:53,091 --> 00:33:56,510
tour next week to hype all my
dates coming up in Florida. Bill,

574
00:33:56,630 --> 00:34:00,770
you coming to Florida? You
didn't mention that. Oh yeah,

575
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,320
go on all the big cities too.

576
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:09,040
I'm going to a Orlando right
home of Disney world now.

577
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:14,900
Like that small shit out here, right?
Just Disneyland. This is Disney world.

578
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:15,710
Uh,

579
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,710
May 6th I'm going to be at the Seminole
hard rock hotel and a casino in

580
00:34:21,141 --> 00:34:25,850
Hollywood, Florida. Then I'm going to
be at the hard rock live in Orlando,

581
00:34:25,851 --> 00:34:30,530
Florida doing two shows.
And then on May 8th,

582
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,250
I'll be at the Times Union Center
for the Performing Arts, more in

583
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,350
Moran Modal Theater in
Jacksonville, Florida. Um,

584
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,350
and hopefully I'll get
their fucking early enough.

585
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,200
I can go to a gun range in suits
and fucking guns with silences.

586
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:49,960
That's some fun shit. Um, God dammit.

587
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,080
That's a good time. Jacksonville
is underrated under fucking
rated city to go to,

588
00:34:54,350 --> 00:34:58,610
I know a lot of people shit
on, you know, northern Florida.

589
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:03,350
But, uh, I gotta be honest with
you. I love a shit town. You know,

590
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,800
there's fun to be had.
Anybody can go to fucking Miami,

591
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,650
go to some fucking Botox party,

592
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,450
whatever the fuck it is
those people do down there.

593
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:14,480
It's like you're not pretty enough.
You gotta fucking laminate your face.

594
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,860
You know, they're just weird. I like
being in those, you know, Tampa,

595
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:25,610
Clearwater, Tallahassee, Orlando,

596
00:35:25,611 --> 00:35:28,280
Jacksonville. Orlando is not
even bad. Orlando's like,

597
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,810
I'm sort of like Orange County.
It just sort of a,

598
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:39,010
I dunno, it has that
mcmansion vibe, you know? Um,

599
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:39,251
I don't know,

600
00:35:39,251 --> 00:35:42,370
but a lot of people live out that way
because there's no a state income tax.

601
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,260
That's why so many Burt Reynolds ended
up going out there. Oj Simpson, you know,

602
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:51,160
all the people that had rough course
cases, you know, double murders, divorces,

603
00:35:51,161 --> 00:35:54,310
all of that shit. You know, they all
end up in Florida. That's when you know,

604
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:58,870
you know, you know, as you get fucking
older, I think he just, that's,

605
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,440
that's one of the major signs that you
were basically a very successful but

606
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:03,801
married.

607
00:36:03,801 --> 00:36:07,760
The wrong person slash maybe
killed somebody is you end
up in Florida if you're

608
00:36:07,761 --> 00:36:11,420
not like indigenous to that
area. Ooh, bell indigenous.

609
00:36:11,421 --> 00:36:14,270
Somebody learned a fucking
word, Huh? All right.

610
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:17,240
Let's see if I can read some
advertising here for the Goddamn Week.

611
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:22,610
The God damn week of May 2nd. You
know, I always make like a, um,

612
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:28,160
a mental note to myself,
uh, at the beginning of May,

613
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,750
even though I live out here in la in
the fucking weather's always great cause

614
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,900
like I'd always just remember like I
always be working and I'd be site that was

615
00:36:35,901 --> 00:36:36,291
may.

616
00:36:36,291 --> 00:36:39,590
And then before I realized that it was
in the August and I was thinking like,

617
00:36:39,591 --> 00:36:43,100
wow, the first light,
90 days of this shit.

618
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:44,320
Yeah.

619
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,000
At least May and June.
I think people,

620
00:36:46,001 --> 00:36:48,700
a lot of people take me in
juvenile June for fucking granted.

621
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,860
MMM.
[inaudible]

622
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,400
I mean, I don't know who I'm
even speaking to at this point.

623
00:36:53,401 --> 00:36:55,320
Does anybody really even
have four seasons anymore?

624
00:36:55,321 --> 00:36:57,870
But if you still live in an area like
this is the time where you gotta be like,

625
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,500
all right, let's make the most of
the decent weather. All right. Okay.

626
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,780
Enough with that shit. Let
me read some of the, uh,

627
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:09,390
some of the advertising here for this
week. All right. Sherry's berries.

628
00:37:10,470 --> 00:37:15,180
Mother's Day is this weekend
only xx days away. Well,

629
00:37:15,181 --> 00:37:18,480
I guess I'm supposed to fill that in
while I'm reading this on a May 1st.

630
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:23,330
So it's seven days away. It's,
um, it's May 8th this year. Uh,

631
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,080
there was no one quite like your mom.

632
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:29,470
Every mom is unique and we wouldn't
want to change the thing. Uh,

633
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,290
talk about your mom or your wife's corks.
Funny stories or sayings.

634
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,850
Oh, yeah. Uh, let's see. Uh, I
never tell my mother when I'm on TV

635
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,970
because she's a mom and no matter what
I do, she's going to give me shit. Ah,

636
00:37:47,971 --> 00:37:50,850
you know what? I don't understand
why you wore that shirt.

637
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:55,440
I liked your performance on Conan
better than on the tonight show.

638
00:37:56,970 --> 00:38:00,660
Um, no, I love my mom, but you know
what I mean? She, she is like, she's,

639
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,860
she's my original like Twitter
troll my entire life. Well,

640
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:09,900
one of the reasons why I'm so driven is
to just one day have a show or a fucking

641
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,480
whatever, whatever the fuck
he called, doing a talk show,
a segment on a talk show.

642
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,720
We're wired to wire. She actually
goes like, you know what?

643
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:23,280
I sat down and I watched it and I don't
have a problem with anything you did.

644
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:27,560
You know, I dunno. Anyways, that's my mom.

645
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,090
I'm going to send some fucking chocolate.

646

of me on undies. But once you try him on,

But let me go to the,

725
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:18,880
let me go to your questions for the week,
ladies and gentlemen,

726
00:43:18,881 --> 00:43:23,860
the questions of the week.
Um, okay. Here we go.

727
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,910
Uh, bike race accident. Dear Bill,

728
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:30,640
did you see the video going
around this weekend of, uh,

729
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:34,400
of the Brooklyn bike race
pileup? No, I didn't. Uh,

730
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:38,830
it really makes you question the
hive mentality of those bikers.

731
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:43,030
I've been involved in some high speed
activities and their inability to stop or

732
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:45,670
slow down properly,
properly is mind blowing.

733
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:49,630
Give it a Google come down to
San Diego once in awhile. Um,

734
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,460
no I haven't seen that.
But uh,

735
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:56,230
I do know that people on a
regular basis fucking die.

736
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,280
I'm not on a regular basis. But
you definitely diamonds. Yeah.

737
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,980
The how fast those fucking guys goes.
Yeah.

738
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:06,280
You're riding a motorcycle
without an engine and I'm,

739
00:44:08,550 --> 00:44:11,440
Oh, you get those fucking little
shorts on, get that road rash.

740
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,820
It's the exact same thing. It
minus the muffler burned. Uh,

741
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,780
but I actually am a big
fan of bike racing though.

742
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,900
I always used to watch the Tour de France
and I love watching lance wind fucking

743
00:44:19,901 --> 00:44:24,310
seven in a row, which he did.
He wants seven in a rough. Okay.

744
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,850
Everybody from him all the way to
the back of the race tested positive.

745
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:30,460
So I'll never,
I'll never give up those seven.

746
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,370
I'll always that he wanted
those fucking things.

747
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:34,200
And I gotta tell you something right now.

748
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,640
I haven't watched it since then because
it's been boring without, you know,

749
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:43,320
it's like tiger woods ever since
his wife fucking flipped out on him.

750
00:44:43,321 --> 00:44:46,440
You know, it took half his money.
The fucking guy isn't one shit.

751
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:51,300
And I never watch golf. I do
like Phil Mickelson though.
I like watching that guy,

752
00:44:51,301 --> 00:44:54,930
that guy. He's like a, the guy fucking
goes for it. He doesn't give a shit.

753
00:44:54,931 --> 00:44:56,970
He's like, yeah, you're behind
a tree. I don't give a fuck.

754
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,330
I'm going to slice right around this
thing. I'm going for the pin. Uh,

755
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:03,930
I don't know. Maybe you should lay
up. Hey, look at all this sweat.

756
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:05,940
I got into my man tits.
You think I'm laying up?

757
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,730
I'm already ready for a fucking
Arnold Palmer. I'm going for the pin.

758
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:12,120
It's what he does every time.
All right, drum workout. Hey sir,

759
00:45:12,121 --> 00:45:16,410
billion big fan of the podcast and
thought I'd share this with you because I

760
00:45:16,411 --> 00:45:21,000
know how much you love drums and
talking about working out. Um, oh yeah,

761
00:45:21,001 --> 00:45:25,820
recently. Yeah. I don't know how
I, I, I missed out on pan terror.

762
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:30,540
I just, you know, I could never get
into that fucking type of singing,

763
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:33,360
you know what I mean? He's
like, Jesus Christ, I heard
this in my house growing up.

764
00:45:33,361 --> 00:45:36,300
I, I don't music used to
take me away from this shit,

765
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:41,301
but just undeniably Vinnie Paul is one
of the great rock drums of all time

766
00:45:41,641 --> 00:45:44,040
without a fucking doubt.
And I don't think he gets the credit.

767
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,730
I was talking to my drum teacher about
this where he's a lot like Alex van Halen,

768
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,590
who's another one of the
great drummers of all time,

769
00:45:49,591 --> 00:45:53,400
but both of them like Alex never
got is do I feel because of Eddie.

770
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,910
Eddie was just so fucking insane that
everybody focused on him and they didn't

771
00:45:56,911 --> 00:45:58,950
really even notice how great Alex was.

772
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:01,140
And I feel like pan
terrorists the same thing.

773
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:05,790
It's kind of creepy how like they
both have brothers, like, you know,

774
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:10,550
there were innovated, innovative, you
know, dying bag. The cab was just,

775
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,460
there was nobody liked either one
of those guitar players in fact.

776
00:46:14,461 --> 00:46:18,660
And then you are else is fucked to
bring it full circle is unfortunately,

777
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,880
when Dimebag was murdered,
um,

778
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,590
I always heard that Eddie donated one of
his key loved Eddie van Halen and Eddie

779
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:28,350
donated one of his guitars.
Um,

780
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,920
I think it was that black and yellow one
and they actually buried with Dimebag.

781
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:35,270
So, uh, I don't know, it's kind of a
morbid way to go around and say, Vinnie,

782
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:38,330
Paul's a fucking amazing drummer. But,
um, I started listening to that song.

783
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:43,110
I'm broken and uh,
you know,

784
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:45,570
it's fucking killing me that I can't
just sit down and try to figure that

785
00:46:45,571 --> 00:46:48,420
fucking song out. Cause I, you know, got
to sit in this fucking writer's room.

786
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,270
I'm really whining about
the writer's room, you know,

787
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,200
cause I'm used to just fucking have in
my days to myself to just sit around,

788
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,800
you know, staring at my dry me undies
balls. Um, all right, drum workouts.

789
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:03,801
So this new workout saw this new workout
where you pretend to play the drums,

790
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:09,660
which is currently available in
the La area. See the video link.

791
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:13,740
Wanted to hear your thoughts. Comment
on these modern gym classes these days.

792
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,710
Time to start soundproofing
that garage gym.

793
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:19,650
Thanks for la for the laughs
and go fuck yourself. Well why,

794
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,850
what I don't understand
like guitar hero or even,

795
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:25,860
I haven't even looked at
this fucking workout class.

796
00:47:25,861 --> 00:47:30,690
Like why wouldn't you just
learn how to play drums? Oh,

797
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:35,140
they're not pretending to play
drums. They have sticks. Oh God.

798
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:36,490
Yeah.

799
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:39,100
Is this going to be white
people trying to be tribal?

800
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,510
Oh yeah.
It's sort of aerobics

801
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,900
and then just playing beats
with sticks and stuff.

802
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,810
Oh my God, this, Oh this
has given me Deuce Chels

803
00:47:58,210 --> 00:47:59,890
ah.
They're like,

804
00:48:00,810 --> 00:48:01,440
okay.

805
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:01,970
Oh God.

806
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:05,790
And they always has to be the person
wearing the hat inside the knitted hat.

807
00:48:09,930 --> 00:48:10,060
Ah,

808
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,460
just when you thought
that awful look went away.

809
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:16,000
You know the guy with the fucking
skinny jeans, the t shirt and then like,

810
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:18,100
I'm going to have a snowball fight hat on.

811
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,790
I'm pretending to play the
drums is now a hot new workout.

812
00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,260
Well they weren't really pretending.

813
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,430
They were actually hitting the floor with
them and stuff and hitting the sticks.

814
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:35,140
So he said there was already a
dance from form in India called

815
00:48:36,690 --> 00:48:38,530
Dan. Yeah. Dan Dia,

816
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:43,240
which has the same concept of dancing
with sticks and a thousand plus years old

817
00:48:43,241 --> 00:48:46,920
tradition. Oh, what a
surprise. What is surprised at?

818
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:50,020
Somebody already come up with a
little gift up, gets people in shape.

819
00:48:50,021 --> 00:48:52,690
It actually kind of looks like fun,
but I my ears couldn't handle,

820
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:55,430
I'd have to have fucking earplugs in.
Um

821
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:56,913
hmm.

822
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,610
I Dunno, but everyone was making those
guitar hero rocket, rocket out faces.

823
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:03,820
But what would be cool is
if that actually, you know,

824
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,370
if you take one of those classes and
you actually want to learn how to play

825
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:09,160
drums, but you know, you can't really
play because you have an apartment.

826
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:13,930
I cannot recommend those Rolling v
drums enough. They're fucking amazing.

827
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:14,770
And uh,

828
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:19,770
I told you when I had to two of
those kits when I was in New York,

829
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:22,900
it's kind of weird because
it's like a computer,

830
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:27,340
like it gets old and then the new one's
better than you. Like, cause you know,

831
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:29,920
if it was an acoustic,
like a regular drum kit,

832
00:49:30,030 --> 00:49:32,590
you just keep it from the fucking drums.

833
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:35,980
But they get the new brains and they're
better. And I don't know, you just keep,

834
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:40,000
just keep, I don't know.
It's a lot of fucking money,
but they're fucking awesome.

835
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:40,780
So if you live,

836
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,880
if you live like the way I did where
I had a neighbor underneath me,

837
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:45,250
I went downstairs and I knocked
on the guys doing, I said, listen,

838
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:51,010
I practice drums. Uh, when do you work?
I'll only practice during those hours.

839
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:54,550
If you're ever home. When I'm
practicing, here's my phone number,

840
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:58,690
call me the second I pick up, you tell me
to stop. I will immediately stop. And we,

841
00:49:58,990 --> 00:49:59,823
uh,

842
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,740
we actually still had a problem because
the first time you heard me play and he,

843
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:05,320
I said, hello. He goes,
can you knock it off?

844
00:50:06,190 --> 00:50:09,190
And I just fucking snapped on the guy. I
was like, dude, don't fucking say that.

845
00:50:09,191 --> 00:50:11,530
Like you asked me 12 fucking times.
It did all that shit.

846
00:50:11,531 --> 00:50:15,640
And then he never called me again
fucking dickhead. Although you know,

847
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:20,050
in defense of him, I can't imagine what
that sounded like underneath, you know,

848
00:50:20,770 --> 00:50:25,090
not Jesus. I'm just fucking,
I'm just, just for attracting
every fucking statement.

849
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:29,270
Alright, shoot matches.
Dear Billy bangers and Mash,

850
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,320
you were talking about shoot, mashes,
shoot matches on this Thursday's podcast.

851
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,880
For those of you who didn't listen,
uh,

852
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:38,540
shoot match is a wrestling
term where basically, you know,

853
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:40,160
the sports entertainment,
you know,

854
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,070
it's a fake fight even though they
really hurting each other, but you know,

855
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,830
it's worked out.
It's sports entertainment.

856
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:50,060
So technically it's fake even though
they're really throwing each other and

857
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:52,940
getting hurt, it is fake. Um,

858
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:57,770
what happens in a shoot match is somebody
fucking snaps and becomes a real fight

859
00:50:57,771 --> 00:51:02,090
and starts beating the shit
out of the person for real. So,

860
00:51:03,350 --> 00:51:05,750
um, he said if you're
into those shoot matches,

861
00:51:05,751 --> 00:51:08,510
you should definitely look
up a wrestler name New Jack.

862
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:13,580
The psycho was known for frequently
shooting on other wrestlers for the most

863
00:51:13,581 --> 00:51:15,290
minor things.
In one case,

864
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:19,730
he thought a tag team was trying
to steal his gangster image.

865
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:23,120
So he hit them with chairs,
full force,

866
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:27,760
stabbed them in the head with forks,
it's Cetera. And another match.

867
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:31,100
He basically tries to murder
a 60 something year old man.

868
00:51:31,340 --> 00:51:35,000
Those matches are brutal as fuck man.
You should check them out.

869
00:51:35,001 --> 00:51:39,350
I actually saw those. Yeah, that
guy has like psychological damages,

870
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,170
damages, psychological damage. Um,

871
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:46,790
I knew a guy liked that when I was
growing up. He went to fucking cops.

872
00:51:46,791 --> 00:51:51,740
School surprise, surprise.
You know, fucking maniacs.

873
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:55,520
You like to be violent. Like they always
end up somehow being bouncers and cops.

874
00:51:55,521 --> 00:52:00,170
I'm not saying they're all like that.
I'm just saying it's like, you know,

875
00:52:00,650 --> 00:52:02,660
people that want to fuck kids,
you know,

876
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,720
they're all about volunteering
to take them out into the woods.

877
00:52:06,050 --> 00:52:10,640
Not saying every cub scout master
as well. I'm just saying, you know,

878
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,740
people who want to beat the fuck out
of people in don't want to go to jail,

879
00:52:15,741 --> 00:52:19,070
get jobs where they have the authority
to beat the fuck out of somebody.

880
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,510
So this fucking lunatic.

881
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:25,520
So he comes back from like his
weekend at cops school and um,

882
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,530
I don't know what he did
and he never got accepted.

883
00:52:27,531 --> 00:52:29,840
They just were like try out thing.
I don't know.

884
00:52:29,841 --> 00:52:31,340
I can't remember was so fucking long ago.

885
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,930
So he wants to show me this move that
he learned and he was doing it in slow

886
00:52:35,931 --> 00:52:40,730
motion. And then I remember
he just fucking looked up
at the ceiling, you know?

887
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:44,750
Do you remember how like, uh, that dude
in full metal jacket when he's like,

888
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:49,310
I am in a world of shit.

889
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,520
Try the joker, you know,
that, that thing, right.

890
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:58,010
He fucking looked up like that and
just fucking full force did the move.

891
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,630
And I heard my fucking wrist snap and um,

892
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,480
I forget how many times I punched
him in the side of the head.

893
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:10,510
I was so fucking mad at him and I was
really just mad at myself because I knew

894
00:53:12,741 --> 00:53:15,830
that he was one of those guys,
like he just fucking like,

895
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,540
like he was one of those key was one of
the exact type of personality that you

896
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:25,160
do not teach that type of shit too.
Because just

897
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:27,840
he was a dope.

898
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:32,070
He never felt like he had power in life
and then he had this new move and he

899
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:33,480
just couldn't handle it.
It was like,

900
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:37,200
you know the whole thing when they always
talk like a baby poisonous snake is

901
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:39,750
the worst, is worse than getting
bit by an adult baby snake.

902
00:53:39,870 --> 00:53:41,610
Cause he dealt babies,
snakes sort of rations out.

903
00:53:41,611 --> 00:53:45,150
The poison with the baby just gives
you fucking both barrels. That's,

904
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,360
that's what the fuck he did. He had the
mentality of a fucking baby reptiles.

905
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:49,140
What I'm saying?

906
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,930
And he fucking jacked up
my goddamn wrist and hey,

907
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:58,080
and you know what? It became
a fucking shoot match. That
was probably as positive.

908
00:53:58,081 --> 00:54:02,100
Show it to me and I just fucking
drilled him in the side of the head like

909
00:54:02,101 --> 00:54:06,060
fucking six times is
hard as I fucking could.

910
00:54:06,061 --> 00:54:10,020
I was so fucking mad at him and
I remember we were both drunk.

911
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:11,730
Yeah.

912
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:16,710
Yeah. Fucking idiot. God bless him.
Um, anyways, moving ahead here.

913
00:54:16,830 --> 00:54:21,000
That was a throwback Thursday story.
All right. Fight dear Billy boy band.

914
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,060
Billy boy band. All right.
Everyone's been asked.

915
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:29,040
Everyone's always asking for
advice. So here's a rhetorical, uh,

916
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:30,090
who's,

917
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:34,980
who wins in a fight to the death between
a silver back gorilla and a grizzly

918
00:54:34,981 --> 00:54:38,730
bear.
One's got Iq and Matt upper body,

919
00:54:38,731 --> 00:54:42,600
the other has razor sharp
claws and skull crushing jars.

920
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:47,730
Uh, thanks, uh,

921
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:51,750
and go sit on it repeatedly.
And I don't know what that means.

922
00:54:51,751 --> 00:54:54,300
Is that like a happy
days, rest reference? Um,

923
00:54:56,690 --> 00:54:58,130
I would say,
uh,

924
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:02,840
it depends on if it's a high,
I'm rooting.

925
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,650
I would go with the home team.
All right.

926
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:10,820
If it's a home game for the grizzly bear
and they're out in an open field and

927
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:15,800
there's no fucking tree for the gorilla
to fucking go up and then come back

928
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:16,461
down,
go up.

929
00:55:16,461 --> 00:55:19,640
You don't do that fucking monkey shit
where they slap you in the fucking head.

930
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:23,480
Um, I would, I would say
the grizzly wins because

931
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:29,340
you know, the gorillas can ball up its
fists, but you know, you're fighting,

932
00:55:29,341 --> 00:55:33,180
it's like you fight and Freddy Krueger
and he's got two gloves for gloves.

933
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:36,030
Actually, I would say. Um,

934
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:39,450
yeah,

935
00:55:39,450 --> 00:55:42,390
I dunno. And I got to admit, like
I think, I think grill is a chill,

936
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:46,560
like I don't think they really
like doing that stuff. And, um,

937
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:52,500
I've watched him fight other
fucking gorillas and, uh,

938
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:53,581
you know,

939
00:55:53,581 --> 00:55:57,570
there's a lot of clutching and grabbing
and shit and I've watched two gorilla

940
00:55:57,600 --> 00:56:00,300
grizzly bears go at it and it's
fucking devastating. Where you like,

941
00:56:00,301 --> 00:56:04,500
how was one of them not dead?
So I would say a grizzly bear.

942
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:08,340
Um,
I don't know.

943
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:11,520
And I'm sure over in Asia that they
have those fights on the weekends

944
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:17,820
somewhere in Asia. They're
doing that right now. Um,

945
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,840
because when I go on Youtube, I'm
just basing that on, you know,

946
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,690
where you go on Youtube is actually
black and white footage of like lions

947
00:56:25,691 --> 00:56:30,250
fighting tigers and shit like that and
fucking cobras fighting these things and

948
00:56:30,251 --> 00:56:31,084
you know,

949
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:35,200
it's not an alligator's first
fucking cobras or whatever
the fuck they was. Just,

950
00:56:35,201 --> 00:56:39,580
you know, like over in Asia,
like the original MMA, you know,

951
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:44,350
UFC type of shit was actually
animals versus animals, you know.

952
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,270
I mean, you've got to give it up
to them. I mean, I know that we,

953
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:51,820
we ask those questions here over in Asia,
they actually get it done. You know,

954
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:56,560
which makes means that they're actually
killing it more in the realm of a,

955
00:56:56,590 --> 00:57:00,700
don't tell me. Show me that. Taking
the initiative is all I'm saying.

956
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:06,310
Um, all right. Here we go. We get
a couple more here. All right. Um,

957
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:09,870
let me read the last two.
Fucking advertising's really quick.

958
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,620
Advertising's advertisements.
Jesus Christ.

959
00:57:15,430 --> 00:57:20,100
It's amazing. An amazing sometimes that,
that English is my first language. Uh,

960
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:24,550
by the way, I'm 64 days in with my
French. I'm learning past tense stuff.

961
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:26,410
I can look at it and I can translate it,

962
00:57:26,411 --> 00:57:30,310
but I can't recall it because I have
no one to speak it with. But, uh,

963
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,620
I have to think that it's
helping me on some level.

964
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,890
I think I'll be able to read a newspaper
by the time I get to fucking France the

965
00:57:35,891 --> 00:57:39,620
next time. I just won't be
able to talk to anybody. Um,

966
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:45,640
whatever. I'll feel I'll figure something
out. All right. Dollar Shave Club.

Use a fresh dollar shave club
blade and Dr Carver's shave butter.

986
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,600
Um,
uh,

987
00:59:08,830 --> 00:59:12,790
two reasons to join Denise to say
easy shave butter. Dr Carver's.

988
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:16,210
Easy shave butter.
Now it's Dr Carver's shave butter.

989
00:59:18,310 --> 00:59:22,820
Anyways, two two reasons to join the

is really kicking it today.

992
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:34,610
One of my eyes is on the word I'm reading
and the other one is like three words

993
00:59:34,611 --> 00:59:39,540
down. I don't know what that is. What
is the medical term for that? Uh,

994
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:43,010
Lazy. I'd all right. stamps.com ah,

are

1016
01:00:58,640 --> 01:01:02,940
Here we go. And, uh, what do I got here?

1017
01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:07,970
I've got the questions. The last two here.
All right, Tom Brady and Jim, or say,

1018
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:12,540
all right, even I'm sick of this fucking
story at this point. What are Billy boy,

1019
01:01:12,570 --> 01:01:14,520
big fan of you by blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1020
01:01:14,521 --> 01:01:19,290
Of course the patch didn't beat the
colts by 34 because of a deflated ball,

1021
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,010
deflated balls. That's not the
point though. Here's an example.

1022
01:01:23,011 --> 01:01:26,130
If a baseball player
is on steroid but goes,

1023
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,760
oh for five on a particular day, what do
you mean? That's not the point though.

1024
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,160
I don't know what point you made.

1025
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:34,413
MMM.

1026
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:40,000
I guess you're saying the deflated ball
didn't affect the outcome of a baseball

1027
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:43,570
player is on steroids, but goes,
oh, for five on a particular day.

1028
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:47,020
Does that mean he didn't cheat?
Of course not.

1029
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:51,120
I hate people who do this
who ask questions for me. Uh,

1030
01:01:51,130 --> 01:01:53,920
the point I'm making is that
it's not about the results.

1031
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:57,910
It's about breaking the rules. See,
this is why I can't stand people.

1032
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:02,650
That's not, this is not what that
decision was about Tom Brady's was,

1033
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,010
was his suspension was reinstated.

1034
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,680
Not because it was proven that he cheated.

1035
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:14,940
This last trial was all about does it
corporation have a right to discipline?

1036
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:19,060
It's employee.
That's what it was about.

1037
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,660
That's what the NFL was fighting.
Cause Tom Brady opened up a can of worms,

1038
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:29,160
which was basically like where your
boss and we said you're suspended.

1039
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:33,780
He appealed it outside of
the NFL into a court of law,

1040
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:38,430
which of course it didn't fucking hold
up cause it was a complete kangaroo court

1041
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,170
for shit fucking thing that happened.

1042
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:41,880
Okay.

1043
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:45,750
You know where the owner of the other
fucking team hires a guy to find dirt on

1044
01:02:45,751 --> 01:02:49,050
the other fucking team, which
you can do on anybody. Right.

1045
01:02:49,051 --> 01:02:52,320
And then then one guy plays judge,
jury and execution.

1046
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:54,180
You take it into a court of law.

1047
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,820
I knew that thing would get laughed
out of court, which had fucking did.

1048
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,640
And Jim Irsay was looked to be a fucking
moron. So then what happened, sir,

1049
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,700
is they changed their argument.
They then went back to say, listen,

1050
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:09,990
we are the NFL, the corporation known
as the national football league.

1051
01:03:10,260 --> 01:03:15,210
Tom Brady is an employee. All
right? We said that he's suspended.

1052
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:19,650
We are his boss.
Do we w we,

1053
01:03:19,651 --> 01:03:24,651
we argue that we have the right
to suspend our own employees.

1054
01:03:25,320 --> 01:03:28,540
That's what it was about.
Okay.

1055
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:32,920
So this is what kills me about all these
people, including Michael [inaudible],

1056
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:37,180
Michael Rappaport who texted me,
right?

1057
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,300
He fucking texted me and he goes,
hi mother fucker.

1058
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,940
Guilty until proven innocent.
Like, like Tom Brady was recess.

1059
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:48,880
Like this suspension was reactivated,

1060
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,140
thus vindicating everybody that says,
Tom Brady's a cheat.

1061
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:55,390
You guys are not paying attention to the
fucking story. That's not what happened.

1062
01:03:55,540 --> 01:04:00,540
What happened was the NFL in a court of
law one the right to suspend Tom Brady

1063
01:04:01,391 --> 01:04:04,510
because Tom Brady is a fucking,
oh God.

1064
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:07,360
Is there anything more relentless than
when your fucking wife calls Jesus Christ?

1065
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:11,890
I've got two more minutes here.
Um, all right, I'll answer it here.

1066
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:16,520
Hang on a second. I'll answer it. Hello.

1067
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:20,990
Hello. It's connecting. Hey,
I'm finishing my podcast.

1068
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:25,280
That's why I have a microphone
and headphones on. I'll
try acquire right back.

1069
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:29,780
Qt By. Um, anyways,

1070
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,420
that's what happens. So I'll
read the rest of this guy. Shit.

1071
01:04:32,421 --> 01:04:37,160
Most buffalo wild wings dopes.
Think what happened was the, uh,

1072
01:04:37,161 --> 01:04:41,270
the NFL appealed it and it got proven
that Tom Brady is in fact a cheater.

1073
01:04:41,271 --> 01:04:45,440
That that was never proven. It
was never proven. All right,

1074
01:04:46,130 --> 01:04:48,710
so I don't know what, so he
goes, if Brady broke the rule,

1075
01:04:48,890 --> 01:04:52,260
then he should be punished.
I don't know if he did or he didn't.

1076
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:56,720
I'm just tired of the argument that
sends pads, the pads blew out the colts.

1077
01:04:56,721 --> 01:04:58,520
It doesn't matter.
Another thing,

1078
01:04:58,521 --> 01:05:02,540
you always say that the colts owner
got rules changed to benefit his teams.

1079
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:04,700
What rules were changed?
As far as I know,

1080
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,270
he only asked that the league enforce
rules that were already in place.

1081
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,980
Now we sat on the rules committee

1082
01:05:12,270 --> 01:05:14,580
when we beat him and we
roughed up as receivers,

1083
01:05:15,060 --> 01:05:18,370
he bitched to the referees and
the referee said that's illegal.

1084
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:21,550
He then made a tape,
he and a and Peyton manning made a tape,

1085
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:23,860
went to the NFL and the NFL said,
that's legal.

1086
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:25,810
Jim Irsay got on the rules committee.

1087
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:30,460
He spearheaded a movement to make the way
we covered their receivers, not legal.

1088
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:35,050
Okay. The cold set a better
offense than we did at the time.

1089
01:05:35,051 --> 01:05:39,100
We had a better defense. He made a rule
change that tipped it in favor of him.

1090
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:42,910
This guy is fucking filthy.
He's fucking filthy.

1091
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:45,940
Those laws were changed.
And why do I have to tell you that?

1092
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:49,660
Why don't you fucking look it up like
you can't find it anyways, he goes,

1093
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:51,610
as far as I know, he only
asked for the no. Yeah,

1094
01:05:51,611 --> 01:05:53,620
as far as you know yet
because you didn't look it up.

1095
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:58,120
The five yard rule for receivers has
been around forever. No, it hasn't.

1096
01:05:59,260 --> 01:06:02,500
No, it hasn't. That
happened in my lifetime.

1097
01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:05,980
The first thing that was
was the Mel blunt rule.

1098
01:06:05,981 --> 01:06:09,670
When he beat the shit out
of Golden Richards in the
super bowl. Don't fuck you.

1099
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,950
You're speaking in general out of these.
I can't fucking,

1100
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,640
I can't stand people like this. Oh,
and it's been around for rubber. Oh,

1101
01:06:15,641 --> 01:06:19,060
this global blue. Oh, the, the,
they don't even look it up.

1102
01:06:19,990 --> 01:06:23,470
That's like version one verse. He
fucking goes like, uh, you know,

1103
01:06:23,471 --> 01:06:25,930
Joe Montana had Jerry Rice.

1104
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,150
It's like he didn't have him
for his first two super bowls.

1105
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:33,250
He had nobody in 81 he had
Freddy Solomon and Dwight Clark.

1106
01:06:33,251 --> 01:06:35,980
Those were his number one and two
receivers. And he had some guy,

1107
01:06:36,010 --> 01:06:40,150
Earl Cooper is a fucking running back.
He won with nobody. He won with people.

1108
01:06:40,370 --> 01:06:42,880
But you want to start one of the
people he won't stars, right?

1109
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:46,960
Fucking millennials. I don't understand
that. Wherever the pre millennials,

1110
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,950
they just don't look at any of them.

1111
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:51,550
He said Earth or say
simply wanted it enforced.

1112
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:55,900
What's wrong with that? Please respond
on your podcast. Even if you shit on me,

1113
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:58,390
I'll remain a listen or you're
funny, mother Fucker, Dude.

1114
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:03,130
That's not what fucking happened. And
all of this shit happen in your lifetime.

1115
01:07:03,131 --> 01:07:05,020
You're just having selective memory.

1116
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,350
He fucking, he said to the
referee's, look at this tape.

1117
01:07:13,351 --> 01:07:16,020
Look what they did. They go,
yeah, we saw it. That's legal.

1118
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:22,730
Unreal. Unreal. And then they
made the tape, how do you
forget this shit? There was,

1119
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:24,990
it was like a little over 10 years ago.
Go look it up.

1120
01:07:24,991 --> 01:07:29,970
That's what the fuck happened. And
then it became, then it became,

1121
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,860
you can't touch them at all.
It wasn't after five yards.

1122
01:07:34,861 --> 01:07:38,160
It wasn't before the five yards.
You're touching moves after them.

1123
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:42,750
The physical contact that they were
having after that that they were bitching

1124
01:07:42,751 --> 01:07:47,520
about, and then that's when it came,
okay, you can do the five yard chuck.

1125
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:51,470
And then after that bullshit,
you can't touch anybody at all.

1126
01:07:51,550 --> 01:07:55,320
Used to be able to handshake. I'm not
saying like, you know that, you know,

1127
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:58,320
10 years ago you could fucking beat the
shit out of me. I'm not saying that,

1128
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:03,321
but it's gradually kept moving towards
what Jim Irsay finally had was like,

1129
01:08:04,441 --> 01:08:07,830
okay, you can push the guy, you know,

1130
01:08:07,831 --> 01:08:11,050
in the first five yards and then this
is the gym or the gym or say ruled that

1131
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,220
his men after that you can't do anything.

1132
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:18,420
Okay.
Which is why right after that,

1133
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,470
all of a sudden all of Dan Marino's
records started falling right and left.

1134
01:08:22,530 --> 01:08:25,290
I remember one year there was
like drew bullies, drew Brees,

1135
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:29,730
Peyton manning and like fucking Tom
Brady were all on pace to break his like

1136
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:34,050
almost 30 year old record.
Yes. Yards in a season. Um,

1137
01:08:35,150 --> 01:08:35,260
yeah,

1138
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:35,951
because of those,

1139
01:08:35,951 --> 01:08:39,490
those ridiculous things that we became
almost a legal to cover a receiver.

1140
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:43,870
It was never like that when I was growing
up ever. And if you don't believe me,

1141
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:47,920
do your homework, go look,
go look at old NFL footage.

1142
01:08:48,060 --> 01:08:49,030
This shit that you could do.

1143
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:52,150
The NBA is the same fucking way you could
beat the shit out of somebody if they

1144
01:08:52,151 --> 01:08:56,140
came down the fucking lane. I mean,
what Kevin Mchale did, the Kurt Rambis,

1145
01:08:56,141 --> 01:08:59,950
I mean back in the [inaudible] data, that
would be like a 10 game suspension, um,

1146
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:03,420
or whatever it would be. You'd be
suspended for a number of games in it.

1147
01:09:03,630 --> 01:09:07,100
And as far as I know, nobody
even got thrown out. Uh,

1148
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,490
but I am going back like 30 years,
so please just,

1149
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:12,430
I don't give a fuck if you want to shit
on my team, but just do your homework.

1150
01:09:12,431 --> 01:09:16,150
That last trial was about a corporation's
right to suspend an employee.

1151
01:09:16,180 --> 01:09:20,590
That's what it was about. It wasn't about
whether Tom Brady was guilty. And, uh,

1152
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:23,830
and for all you concept out there who
are just obsessed with this air pressure,

1153
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,610
what if Tom Brady had fucking steroids
delivered to his fucking mailbox in his

1154
01:09:27,611 --> 01:09:30,970
wife's name? Give me a fucking
break already. And even then,

1155
01:09:30,971 --> 01:09:31,810
I gotta be honest with you.

1156
01:09:31,811 --> 01:09:35,470
I don't think steroids changed
the outcome of the game.

1157
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:40,210
They help your personal performance.
But if steroids just met you won the game,

1158
01:09:41,080 --> 01:09:44,710
then you know, teams that did
steroids, they're there, but they,

1159
01:09:44,711 --> 01:09:46,220
when they just go on defeated.
Yeah,

1160
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:47,660
okay.

1161
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:52,440
I Dunno. It gives you a competitive
edge. It does. And you know, whatever, I,

1162
01:09:52,450 --> 01:09:56,180
I am not against steroids. I think
steroids should be fucking legalize.

1163
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,420
They should be researched
to the hilt and um,

1164
01:10:02,420 --> 01:10:05,960
just for literally for the quality of
life then everyone's going to have,

1165
01:10:05,961 --> 01:10:07,790
I can't,
I mean singers blow out their voices,

1166
01:10:07,791 --> 01:10:11,120
they get to take a steroid and they
go out to sing the fucking song.

1167
01:10:11,121 --> 01:10:15,890
There'll be in the crowd says
that they cheated. Right. I Dunno.

1168
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:20,330
Anyways, what's flower head?
Whatever. I'm, I'm fucking,

1169
01:10:20,630 --> 01:10:24,410
I'm done arguing that especially at this
point when all of that information that

1170
01:10:24,411 --> 01:10:25,520
I just said is out there.

1171
01:10:25,670 --> 01:10:29,060
I might've had a couple of things wrong
cause I don't have the literally the

1172
01:10:29,061 --> 01:10:30,140
documents in front of me.

1173
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:34,040
But basically what I'm saying is true
and I just don't want to argue this shit

1174
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:37,190
anymore. Okay. No matter what,
this guy's going to get suspended.

1175
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,280
Cause at the end of the day he
works with his fucking corporation.

1176
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,980
And you know what the
NFL is actually right.

1177
01:10:43,670 --> 01:10:47,040
I think they're wrong to suspend
Tom Brady. I think that the,

1178
01:10:47,041 --> 01:10:50,270
the investigation and all of that
was an absolute fucking witch hunt.

1179
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,740
I think all of that is bullshit.

1180
01:10:51,950 --> 01:10:55,760
But I do think that the NFL is a
corporation has to maintain the right to

1181
01:10:55,761 --> 01:10:59,900
suspend somebody. So if the bus has
to roll over Tom Brady, then so be it.

1182
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,680
Cause it's gonna make for a better
league because if he gets away with this,

1183
01:11:03,681 --> 01:11:06,740
then everybody is going to appeal it
outside of the NFL and then they lose

1184
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:11,000
control. And as much as I'm not a
fan of monopolies, as a sports fan,

1185
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:15,780
it works out great. Like the UFC is to
shit because the fighters have no options.

1186
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,190
I feel bad for those guys,

1187
01:11:17,191 --> 01:11:21,000
but it's great for me as a fight fan
because the best guys have to fight the

1188
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:24,330
best guys. Um, all right. Advice.

1189
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:28,370
I smell. All right. I have a car.

1190
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:32,490
I have a crippling health issues
since I was a kid. I fucking stink.

1191
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,590
People tell me I smell moldy.

1192
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,690
No doctor knows why Colone deodorants
can't mask it. Oh my God. He goes,

1193
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:44,370
the odor actually gets stronger when I
use those things. Showering doesn't help.

1194
01:11:44,520 --> 01:11:49,520
So I am left alone with the this issue
I'm trying to eat as healthy as possible

1195
01:11:50,881 --> 01:11:52,110
and exercise every day,

1196
01:11:52,111 --> 01:11:56,190
which seems to reduce the problem by 50%,

1197
01:11:56,460 --> 01:12:00,630
which sounds like a lot but
still doesn't satisfy me.

1198
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:03,990
I think it's a metabolic issue,
which I don't even know what that is.

1199
01:12:03,991 --> 01:12:06,900
And the body is trying to get rid
of the toxins through the skin.

1200
01:12:07,410 --> 01:12:08,790
Not sure though,
either way.

1201
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:13,200
My whole life revolves around this
shit and it led me through episodes of

1202
01:12:13,790 --> 01:12:17,670
depression as a teenager and I even
considered throwing myself off a bridge or

1203
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:22,180
in front of one of those
great white trains, uh,

1204
01:12:22,190 --> 01:12:23,460
US Germans are making,

1205
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,390
but life is actually
decent despite this issue.

1206
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:30,990
I can't attend any college
classes because of the anxiety,

1207
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:35,340
but I have a great amount of friends.
I'm happy, funny, alright. Looking Guy.

1208
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:40,120
And my game is all right. So I still
get my dick wet. Sometimes gross. Uh,

1209
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:43,350
can't lock down any girl
though for obvious reasons.

1210
01:12:43,670 --> 01:12:45,270
I don't even know why I wrote all of this,

1211
01:12:45,271 --> 01:12:50,130
but I just wanted to tell you that
this podcast and your comedy are really

1212
01:12:50,131 --> 01:12:53,250
stimulating.
My Butt's thinking brain,

1213
01:12:53,251 --> 01:12:56,990
please come to Germany so we can see
your show and I can harass you nose.

1214
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,850
Thanks for reading and go fuck
yourself and your dog. Just kidding.

1215
01:12:59,851 --> 01:13:04,230
I like your dog. Just go fuck
yourself. I'm all right dude. Um,

1216
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:07,790
I would just keep going
to doctors if they,

1217
01:13:07,810 --> 01:13:10,710
I bet they could figure something out.
You know,

1218
01:13:11,070 --> 01:13:15,270
it's gotta be some new agey type of thing,
some sort of detox.

1219
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:18,600
If it's your body getting rid of a toxic,
maybe you're allergic to something.

1220
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:23,100
I have no idea. I am not, obviously
not a doctor here, but yeah.

1221
01:13:23,710 --> 01:13:24,543
Okay.

1222
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,940
Detox, fasting, changing your diet.

1223
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:35,240
Um, there's gotta be, there's
gotta be a way to do that.

1224
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:37,460
I remember long time ago,
there was some woman that just had,

1225
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:41,390
was talking about she had brutal
Halitosis, which is, uh, you know,

1226
01:13:41,540 --> 01:13:45,020
you breads fucking stinks. It
was fucking brutal. And, um,

1227
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:48,590
it turned out she had some sort of sinus
infection and then once they cleared

1228
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:53,340
that up for fucking, her breath
was fine. So I bet you have.

1229
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,270
Yeah,

1230
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:58,150
I, you know, if I had to guess,
there's something undiagnosed,

1231
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:02,470
you know. Oh God, I'm so in over my head.

1232
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:05,230
You got something maybe that you
have some sort of fucking infection.

1233
01:14:05,231 --> 01:14:09,220
I have no fucking idea. And I bet you know
there's gotta be something that is if,

1234
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:12,550
if, if somebody can take a nap and
drive to work and not kill anybody,

1235
01:14:12,730 --> 01:14:14,470
they got to figure out why your moldy.

1236
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:17,680
I would just keep going
to specialists and I,

1237
01:14:17,681 --> 01:14:20,920
if you guys have nationwide
healthcare over there, I would just,

1238
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:24,550
that would be my new hobby,
you know,

1239
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:28,000
and just keep adding to your file and
somebody comes in and somebody will

1240
01:14:28,001 --> 01:14:30,940
finally crack the fucking case
as to why you smelled moldy.

1241
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:33,190
I bet they can figure it out,
you know?

1242
01:14:33,191 --> 01:14:36,420
And then what would be great is you
went to the alienation of this. See,

1243
01:14:36,421 --> 01:14:41,230
you got the sense of humor that
comes from feeling alienated and um,

1244
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:47,380
I, your life will be a fucking joke
after that. I mean, think about it too.

1245
01:14:47,381 --> 01:14:49,150
If you could just stop smelling moldy,

1246
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:52,210
I would think that that's the number
one thing. And then you'd be happy.

1247
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,540
You live your life would
be at fucking joke.

1248
01:14:56,500 --> 01:14:57,850
So if you have nationwide healthcare,

1249
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,750
I would be seeing a doctor like fucking
every couple of days. All right buddy.

1250
01:15:02,620 --> 01:15:05,170
It's like you're pulling people out of
the crowd. He hit the half court shot.

1251
01:15:05,171 --> 01:15:08,730
Eventually it's, the ball's going to
go in, I believe in June. It's fuel.

1252
01:15:08,860 --> 01:15:13,600
It's fucking Germany. You guys
got you guys a fucking, you know,

1253
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,550
half our space program we stole from
you guys. The whole seeds of it.

1254
01:15:19,090 --> 01:15:22,480
Audio tape, all that shit. You guys
had better machine guns that we did.

1255
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,720
Ours would overheat. Sophie
killed you. We actually picked,

1256
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:27,580
we dropped our guns and
picked up your machine.

1257
01:15:27,581 --> 01:15:31,270
Guns is no fucking way in 2016 they
can't figure out why your moldy.

1258
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:32,440
I feel bad for you,
man.

1259
01:15:32,441 --> 01:15:36,220
I'm rooting for you and I hope you figure
it out before you come out to my shelf

1260
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:40,540
and a, I should probably know the answer
