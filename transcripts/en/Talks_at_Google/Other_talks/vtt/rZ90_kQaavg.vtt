00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.930
narrator: I'm very excited today to welcome
Jerry Beck. He is going to talk to us about

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.080
his new book "The 100 Greatest Looney Tunes".
Just a little background on Jerry. He's an

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.940
animation historian and cartoon producer.
He's written over 15 books on the subject,

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.550
including: "The Animated Movie Guide", "Looney
Tunes. The Ultimate Visual Guide", and "The

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.710
50 Greatest Cartoons". And he's also the co-founder/co-writer
of the popular animation blog Cartoon Brew.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.110
And Jerry is a former studio executive with
Nickelodeon and Disney and currently a consulting

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.970
producer to Warner Bros., Universal, and Disney
for their classic-animation, DVD compilations.

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.230
He's also taught animation history at NYU,
SVA, the AFI, and UCLA. So please join me

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:45.230
in welcoming Jerry Beck.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.190
[audience applause]

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.480
Jerry: Thank you. Okay. Well, this first for
me actually, I haven't really gone out talking

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:04.769
about this particular book, but I'm really
grateful for the opportunity to do so. I guess

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.549
what I'm going to do is tell you a little
bit about how I got into cartoons, and I'm

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.600
also going to read a little bit from the introduction
that I wrote, and then hopefully we'll have

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.840
time to look at a couple of clips. I guess
everybody thought they would be coming to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.859
lunch and seeing some cartoons today and that
kind of thing but we'll do our best to try

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:22.890
sneak some clips in.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:34.380
I, I- when I was a kid I really -- I watched
cartoons on TV and actually never laughed;

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.780
I remember not laughing at cartoons; I never
thought they were funny. It was only later,

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.190
when I did laugh at them that I realized I
had never laughed at them before. I just took

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.409
what was going on the screen as real, you
know. It was just things that I'm supposed

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.259
to watch. And somewhere in my teenage years
I used to come home from school around three

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:56.490
o'clock and my local -- I was in -- from New
York. The local station was running a Bugs

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.100
Bunny and Caspar cartoons at like three o'clock
and I would just come home, I'd flip the TV

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.799
on, I'd do some other stuff, and I started
to notice how great these Looney Tunes were.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.390
Not only were they better than those Caspar
cartoons [a.], but [b.] they were actually

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.010
funny. I was laughing at them. And I also
started noticing the artistry.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.650
I was like a kid who always wanted to draw
comic books and drew comics in school. And

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.841
how did they make those things move, and,
and, and what is the story on these cartoons?

00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:35.090
They're hilarious. I got sss-, I cou-I knew
about Mel Blanc from the credits. I slowly

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.110
began to notice the names of the directors.
And one day, one fateful Saturday morning,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.420
I turned on -- after watching a lot these
cartoons, I turned on Saturday morning's Bugs

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.239
Bunny show. And it was already started, and
a cartoon was on. It was that one with, "Not

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.670
happy birthday, not happy birthday." Does
anybody know that one?

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.670
Laughing.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.530
It's the one. It's- it's a- it's one where
a cat's versus a-a dog, and there's penalties.

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.870
And the cat character always is -- every time
he gets caught, he screams something like,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.209
"Not the bridge, not the bridge." And then
they do some crazy punishment that had something

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.680
to do with a bridge. And I had seen that cartoon
before and here it was again, and I realized,"Okay.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.080
What's the name of this cartoon?" I needed
to know. I-I want to know, where can I go

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.709
to look for that? And there was no Google
then. There was no Internet then. There was

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.959
no books on the subject of Looney Tunes. I
mean really this was in the 70s, and it was

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.560
pretty isolated out there. There were a couple
books on Disney, and that's about it. And

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.030
even those weren't thorough reference books.
And how could anybody find out the name of

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.379
this thing unless I have to watch all these
cartoons again, in rotation. Maybe six months

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.849
from now, they might rerun it, and I'd have
to have written down the title. Well, that's

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:52.859
exactly what I did.

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:59.790
I started writing down the titles, and I started
to research these cartoons more thoroughly.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:07.200
I needed to know everything about them and
that led me to, in my case, and being in New

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.439
York, I-I -- and this is the 70s, but I ended
up finding out there was a college class.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:16.000
This was after I had gotten out of high school.
And I was going to the School of Visual Arts

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.430
in New York to be an animator. That was my-my
goal. But I found out there was a class being

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:28.300
taught at the new school by a-a guy that,
that -- an author named Leonard Maltin. And

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.770
Leonard had just did-did a book on the Disney
films and had his Movie Guide, his first Movie

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.680
Guide had just come out and was doing a class
on animated cartoons. And I said, "I have

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.590
to meet this guy, and I have to, have to take
this class." And I ended up meeting him, and

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.770
we ended up becoming great friends and colleagues
throughout this time, and I ended up helping

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.639
him on a book called "Of Mice and Magic",
which came out in 1980. And that was really

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.050
the first big history book of all the American
animated cartoon studios and doing the research

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.940
for about three or four years immersed me.
I was his research associate. I got kind of

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.961
a credit like that on the front page, but
I -- it immersed me into the world of the

00:05:07.961 --> 00:05:11.889
Hollywood Cartoon and who the players were
and what the films were and what the studios

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.030
did and which cartoons came out from which
place and it was ľit was-. And it's, and

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.830
I thought when we did that book -- and it
came out in 1980 -- that that would be- that

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.169
was it. We-we-we-we researched it and we published
a book and it's all in here and there's nothing

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:26.169
else to do.

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.160
And here I am, how many years later? ľ 30
years later or something? And, and I have

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.420
a blog where we publish new information every
single day about the history of animation

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.960
and in our blog, we do history and we do what's
going on today and hopefully, what's happening

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:49.360
in the future. But in doing it, I never thought,
uh. I didn't intend to write, make a career

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.259
of writing books about Looney Tunes, but it
just sort of ended up that way. After "Of

00:05:53.259 --> 00:05:59.770
Mice and Magic," I did a more thorough book
that listed all the 1001 Looney Tunes cartoons

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.110
with all the credits and plot synopsizes and
all that stuff. And, and, and beyond that,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.020
I was then asked by Warner Bros. to actually
help me- help them put together some other

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:12.020
books.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.139
I did one on Tweety and Sylvester and one
that was like a visual guide to the, to all

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:25.300
the characters. And about 15 years ago, about
1994, I was talking to a publisher and I-

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.550
we had this brainstorm about doing a book
called "The 50 Greatest Cartoons" and, and

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.509
we did it. And this was again before the internet
and before Google and before blogs and all

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:42.419
that stuff. And so what we did was we sent
out surveys. Printed surveys to, I think five

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:49.289
th-, I think it was 5000 anybodies . Five
thousand people in animation societies, animators,

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:56.020
schools, film critics, writers, anyone we
knew who should know people around the world.

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:01.570
We got back about a thousand. And that's normal,
you know, you get back about a 1000. And we

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:05.970
did a consensus of that and we did a book
called the "The 50 Greatest Cartoons". And

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:13.099
in that book, about half of those cartoons
were Warner Bros. cartoons, and, and that

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:17.539
book came out and it was, it was a big deal
the year it came out. It was actually quite

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:23.289
popular, and sold out a lot of the,-- a lot
of the animation schools use it as a reference

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:30.390
and all that. And actually regular schools.
And they, and it went out of print. It was

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.350
published by Turner publishing, and it went
out of print. And that company went out of

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.919
business, when Turner got rid of things like
that. And it's been in limbo and luckily now

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:44.280
because of the Internet with Amazon and eBay
and things like that, you can actually buy

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.280
a copy of it if you want to, but it was really
hard to find it for years and years and years.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.300
I thought to myself, "I really want to do
that book again". I want to do it over again

00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:56.689
'cause now there's more films. There's more
things to think about. And long story short,

00:07:56.689 --> 00:08:05.449
this publisher in San Francisco that did this
new book called me up and they had just gotten

00:08:05.449 --> 00:08:10.500
a license. They'd decided to license Looney
Tunes from Warner Bros. and they asked me

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.781
if I had any ideas for a, for a new book.
And I said, "You know what? I'd love to do

00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:18.389
my book, "The 50 Greatest Cartoons" again,
but maybe we can adapt it to Looney Tunes

00:08:18.389 --> 00:08:23.110
since so many of those were in there. And
I learned one lesson from that previous book

00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:28.970
 -- make it a 100 because 50 is not enough.
And a 100 is not enough when it comes to Looney

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:40.720
Tunes. They're, there, there's probably honestly
ľ there is possibly 50% of that -- maybe

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:46.579
a little less than 50, but maybe 40% that
honestly are not great cartoons. There's a

00:08:46.579 --> 00:08:50.829
lot of them that were made in the 60s when
the budgets were very low, and in the 30s

00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:56.850
when they hadn't reached- gotten to the style
that we know of, the, and before Chuck Jones

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:02.620
and Tex Avery the great animators got there.
So, you can kind of get rid, dismiss a lot

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.310
of those, although I like a lot of them.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:12.490
And then you still, you still have hundreds
that are really good. And, so what I say at

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.790
this book in the beginning in the introduction
is that we're probably going to disappoint

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:20.920
some people by not by what's in here but by
what's not in here. The ones we couldn't,

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.339
that wouldn't fit into the 100. And I'm going
to read just a notch from the beginning of

00:09:26.339 --> 00:09:34.470
my intro because it really is what I feel
about these cartoons. I sayů

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.600
"No doubt about it the Looney Tunes are the
funniest cartoons ever made. In fact, I'll

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.700
take that statement a bit further. I believe
the Warner Brothers' cartoons are as classic

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.910
as anything in American cinema and should
be ranked alongside the likes of the "Wizard

00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.370
of Oz", "Casablanca", "Gone with the Wind",
and "Citizen Kane"."

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:59.610
And I really believe that. I mean when I,
when I deal with Warner Bros. as a consultant

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:05.960
and the people I deal with there are great,
the people at Warner Home Video. They get

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.889
it. That's why we were able to do -- I was
involved with their Looney Tunes Golden Collection

00:10:09.889 --> 00:10:13.410
DVDs that came out. And if you have that,
if you seen those you know that they're really,

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:17.480
really good. And so that means that the people
there really get it. But, but there is an

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:24.430
attitude at Warner's on-on other levels that
that this is just old kids stuff. This is

00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:28.300
why right now, right at this moment they're
not on TV. They're nowhere to be seen. The

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.440
only place you can actually watch them outside
of , well, they're not on anywhere. They're

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:38.010
only on DVD and if you can possibly find some
of them on YouTube. And I say that because

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.950
Warner's is pretty good about going in and
getting rid of them if they are on YouTobe

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:45.630
YouTube. But basically they're nowhere to
be seen. And when I, when we grew up everybody

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:50.141
in this room, they were actually on several
different channels. They were on The Cartoon

00:10:50.141 --> 00:10:56.971
Network, Nickelodeon. They were on the Warner
Bros. the WB. They were on ABC Saturday morning.

00:10:56.971 --> 00:11:01.561
They were all they were ubiquitous. They were
everywhere. And we all grew up with them and

00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:08.892
right now there's a-a, and that's been that
way again for 40 years or more. Only in the

00:11:08.892 --> 00:11:13.760
last five they've been completely gone and
so I -- when somebody just told me a moment

00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:18.480
ago the first, the first DVD that they bought
for their kid, I think that's how you put

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:24.100
it, was one of the Looney Tunes Sets, I said,
"Good Dad." -- that definitely we have to

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:31.800
spread the word. I feel like I'm a preacher
preaching the gospel right now. As I write

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.800
hereů

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.079
"True we're talking about seven minute cartoons.
Humorous drawings made with pen-pen, ink and

00:11:37.079 --> 00:11:43.750
paint that usually featured talking animals
in impossible, hilarious situations. But the

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.250
Warner Bros. Cartoons created, as do all great
films, original characters with believable

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:53.560
personalities and motivations. Who doesn't,
who doesn't know someone like Daffy Duck?

00:11:53.560 --> 00:12:00.260
Who doesn't sometimes feel like Wile E. Coyote?
Who doesn't want to be Bugs Bunny? The cartoons

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:06.029
themselves are miniature works of art that
often mix sophisticated filmmaking techniques

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:13.779
and brilliant artwork with witty dialogue
and hysterical situations. It should be noted

00:12:13.779 --> 00:12:19.680
that despite the popular misconception, these
cartoons were never aimed exclusively for

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.880
kids. In fact, the filmmakers claim to have
made them for themselves. Because of their

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.920
technical brilliance and sharp-eyed humor,
the Looney Tunes have stood the test of time.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:36.010
They've become permanent fixtures in global
pop culture and as with all fine art can be

00:12:36.010 --> 00:12:40.200
enjoyed again and again, touching us with
something new upon each viewing."

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:49.560
Anyway, I would like to just-what I'll do
right now is --h I will show some clips, and

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:54.709
if you have any questions about the history
of Looney Tunes or anything else I'm involved

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:57.959
with, anything to do with the world of animation
I'd be happy to answer that.

00:12:57.959 --> 00:13:01.779
male #1: So how's the condition of the -- of
all the materials over at Warner Brothers?

00:13:01.779 --> 00:13:05.550
I mean, there's a lot of times when people
considered that the cartoons would have just

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:07.389
had their short life and then that would be
it.

00:13:07.389 --> 00:13:08.389
Jerry: Yeah.

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:09.389
male#1: But now they're restoringů

00:13:09.389 --> 00:13:10.389
Jerry: Yeah.

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:12.890
male #1: ůand putting everything together
and how do you feel about the-the difference

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:18.230
in -- given how involved you are with, with
classic cartoons for all the studios about

00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.430
 -- cleaning the elements to the point where
none of the flaws are visible. I mean, Disney's

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.880
reissues right now are, are pristine. And
it is a question ofů

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880
Jerry: Rightů

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:32.120
male #1: ůis the film grain, is the way that
it looks from a theatrical experience the

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:37.600
art or is it the animation itself? Where do
you stand on all of this? And what do you

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.340
know about the state of our elements right
now?

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:45.519
Jerry: Wow. That's a great question. I'm happy
to answer it. I hope it doesn't bore anybody

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:50.540
because I usually get the trivia questions
or something about Looney Tunes. So, great,

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:57.990
this is my subject. I usually look at the
glass half full. There's a lot of the elements

00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:04.200
outside of Disney, outside of the Disney Company.
They always preserved all their films really

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:10.930
well for the most part. And then they they-they
almost over do it when they do their-their

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:15.639
restorations. I'm not crazy about thů some
of the super recent ones they put out like

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:20.930
"Pinocchio", I think they did a really good
job. Some of the earlier versions of "Bambi"

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:26.639
that I have seen, "Peter Pan", "Snow White"
that are coming to mind, they are cleaned

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:30.889
up to a ridiculous degree that it almost looks
like artificial. It doesn't look real. It

00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:35.450
doesn't look-it looks strange for some reason.
It's clean, but it's it looks-it doesn't look

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:40.540
right. I don't understand that. I don't understand
why I feel that way or why it is. I think

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:46.470
they just over did it. So, I'm-I'm-I'm somebody
who thinks you-it should be an honest transfer,

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:51.779
where you, where you can still see that it
was. There's chemical mistakes that were made

00:14:51.779 --> 00:14:55.959
in the lab on one frame. You could kind of
leave it. You don't have to really clean every

00:14:55.959 --> 00:15:01.779
little speck up. There's-there is unfortunately
the other end of the spectrum. There's a cleanup

00:15:01.779 --> 00:15:09.389
process that exists called DVNR which is the
digital video cleanup removal whatever. It's-It's

00:15:09.389 --> 00:15:15.009
a, what it does is it takes out- if they're
restoring a live action film and they're putting

00:15:15.009 --> 00:15:21.120
it through the digital cleanup and if there's
a bit of dirt on one frame it'll take the

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:26.920
dirt out and replace it with the image or
the color. Fine. But when you do that with

00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:31.269
animation-- animation is frame by frame -- there
could be a different drawing on every frame.

00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:38.540
So it reads this -- it reads the drawings
as dirt, and it eliminates the outline. This

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.940
is a weird thing. And there are videos out
there that you can see this on. So, it just.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.790
Suddenly the characters are moving and they
have no- they don't have that outline that

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:50.399
they have. Now this is-isn't on any of the
Looney Tunes sets but there's there's definitely

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:55.220
some examples in the past where this has happened
and it's something that people like me have

00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.000
to go in there and say, 'Don't use that cleanup
system."

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.790
I'm very proud of the Popeye, I don't want
to get off the subject, but Popeye- we did

00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:07.209
Popeye for Warner Home Video and we've restored
those. Those fantastic Flasher cartoons. They're

00:16:07.209 --> 00:16:13.520
classics and the highlights of those sets
are these two reelers, these Technicolor ľ

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.060
"Popeye Meets Sinbad", "Popeye Meets Aladdin".
And if you've seen them before on public domain

00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:22.930
videos or anywhere else, you haven't seen
them the way they look on this DVD set. They

00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:28.260
look like, they are jaw-dropping. They are
in restored Technicolor with 3-D backgrounds

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:33.730
and gorgeous with the original titles back
on that say "Paramount Pictures Presents"

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.940
and all that. One of my big campaigns for
20 years now -- and I'm still not done because

00:16:38.940 --> 00:16:41.690
it hasn't happened yet -- is the "Bugs Bunny
Show".

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:47.839
In 1960 on ABC TV, there was a series called
the "Bugs Bunny Show" that lasted two years.

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:55.360
It was something like 56 episodes. Maybe there's
more than that. And it was basically, it was

00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:00.050
brand-new footage that they animated with
Mel Blanc doing the voices of Bugs Bunny coming

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.509
out on stage. You've all seen the opening
'cause they use that opening over and over

00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:07.440
again for Saturday morning where they march
out on stage. That was part of the original

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.330
opening of this show, and they, they had the
characters come out and they'd be on stage

00:17:13.330 --> 00:17:17.790
and they'd be talking and it would go into
an old cartoon. And there'd be three old cartoons

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.070
and this bridging material in between. Well,
this show was never syndicated. It was only,

00:17:23.070 --> 00:17:27.510
after it went off the network in 1962, it
was then put on Saturday morning network and

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:33.041
it stayed on Saturday morning network technically
becoming-under various names "Bugs Bunny Show",

00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:37.630
the "Bugs Bunny Roadrunner Show", the "Bugs
Bunny Tweety Show", whatever. It stayed on

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:42.850
network Saturday morning for like 30 years.
So it, so the original show, the original

00:17:42.850 --> 00:17:47.950
version, which was a half hour, was never
syndicated. You've never seen ľ it's, I mean

00:17:47.950 --> 00:17:50.890
it's never been rerun the way it was originally
shown.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:57.230
We, we tried on some of these DVD Golden Collections
to restore a couple of episodes. When they,

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.571
when they, when they, when they kept it going
on Saturday mornings throughout the years

00:18:02.571 --> 00:18:07.410
they just chopped up the original negatives.
Every year they would just chop them and slice

00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:12.540
'em and dice 'em. And so the original materials
were kind of gone, they were just just chopped

00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:19.050
up, and we could only find black-and-white
white prints of some of those episodes. So

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:22.980
on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVDs
that I was involved with we-we usually put

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.650
one per-per volume we-we tried to restore
in a Frankenstein way, where it goes from

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:30.570
black-and-white to color to black and white.
We tried to give you an idea of what this

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:36.560
show was like. It's one of the great unrestored
things still at Warner's. And every year,

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:40.010
every meeting I have with them, I bring it
up. It's something we wanted to do. It just

00:18:40.010 --> 00:18:45.510
costs so much money to do it and we don't
know how we are going to do it. We don't know

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:51.130
if, we suspect there might be original negatives
in Europe. We may have to colorize the black-and-white

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:55.550
parts. There's all these aspects to how you
would actually restore this show. But it's

00:18:55.550 --> 00:19:00.480
a real crime that it doesn't exist. I could
go on and on.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.590
So do we have any other questions? -that are
a little easier?

00:19:05.590 --> 00:19:08.900
female #1: There doesn't seem to be any Tweety
Bird cartoons in this book.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:09.900
Jerry: Oh, there are. There are.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.900
female #1: There are?

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:17.260
Jerry: Yeah. I'll-I'll-I'll find one for you.
I think, uhh, is Tweety Pie not there. The

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.210
list is in alphabetical order. So,...

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:25.820
Female #1: ůand also, I've always liked Looney
Tunes because it's edgy. Like it, it's like,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:30.720
it has violence, it has cross-dressing, and
it has like all these crazy things in there.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:37.320
And Disney was always like too goody-two-shoes,
very goody-two-shoes and was there like. Did

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.790
the creators -- was that a specific response
to the Disney cartoons?

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:47.310
Jerry: Yeah. Actually it is. First of all
an answer that- "Bird's Anonymous" and I think

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.520
there's more than one, but "Bird's Anonymous",
which is it doesn't have a picture of Tweety

00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:57.830
in the, in the, on the first page of the thing
that's a Tweety cartoon. That was an Oscar-winning

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:04.420
Tweety cartoon. And I think there might be
another one. Yes, in the mid-30s, late 30s,

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:11.780
when Tex Avery, a young cartoonist, who was
just loaded with ideas on what, what you could

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:21.140
do in animated cartoons, got hired by Warner
Bros. as a director. He started the unit with

00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:28.720
Bob Clampett and Chuck Jones, and, and also
Frank Tashlin, another young cartoonist, an

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:34.150
animator who also joined the studio at that
time, had a completely different mindset about

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.920
what these animated cartoons should be. And
luckily their producer, Leon Schlessinger,

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.810
at that time really didn't care. He said,
"Go for it, as long as it's funny. That's

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:50.320
what people seem to expect back from cartoons.
Make them funny." And their attitude was,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.720
everybody was following Disney. It's kind
of like today. It's not that much different

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:59.590
today with all the animation that's out there.
Pixar is really the leader. They're doing

00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:05.300
innovative stuff every single year, every
single time. And Dreamworks and Blue Sky and

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:10.280
all the studios that are out there from all
the other movie studios are trying to keep

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.060
up with, with Pixar. They're not even trying
ľ a lot of them aren't -- to do anything

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.782
different as far as I'm concerned, I think
Sony is actually-- Sony's trying to do some

00:21:19.782 --> 00:21:24.250
funny stuff it seems to me. But everybody's
just trying to keep up with Pixar. Pixar is

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:25.250
leader.

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.220
female#1: Everyone's just trying to do familyů

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:30.220
Jerry: Right.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.220
female#1 ůno one's edgy.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.220
Jerry: Right, exactly.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:33.220
female#1: It's the same storyů

00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.670
Jerry: It isů

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:42.760
female#1: It's always the same story again
and again and again. It's boring to watchů

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:43.760
Jerry: Yeah.

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:44.760
female#1: ůit's 3D. It's eye-popping, they're
like so what. Well, the story's not everything.

00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:45.760
Jerry: Yeahůyea-although did you see "Cloudy
With A Chance Of Meatballs"?

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:46.760
Female#1: No I didn't.

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.590
Jerry: I really like that film. That's a good
one. Check that one out. Everybody here is

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:53.190
shaking their heads. [whispering] Good, good
one.

00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:57.280
But that's what was happening in the 30s.
Disney was the leader in the shorts, winning

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:03.770
all the Oscars. Their shorts were just miles
ahead. You look at a 1935 Disney cartoon short

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:08.930
versus a 1935 Warner Bros., Paramount, or
any other studio's short subject. They were

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:13.140
literally three or four years ahead of them.
It was just ahead of the pack. And then, Disney

00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.380
announces they are going to do a feature.
They are going to break through. They are

00:22:16.380 --> 00:22:21.130
going to do "Snow White". "Snow White" comes
out and it was the "Avatar" of its day. It

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:27.330
was the sensation of its day. And, and the
other studios were like, and literally there's

00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:33.220
articles, in my research, there's articles
in all the trade magazines where they interview

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:37.980
the other studios and whether they're gonna
make features or not to follow Disney and

00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:43.780
Paramount was the only one that did it with
"Gulliver's Travels". The other ones, some

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.860
of them said they were, and they ended up
not doing it. The other ones were shaking

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:50.060
their heads. "We don't, we don't know, we're
are not doing that."

00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.910
Warner's said, "We're stickin' to shorts and
we're gonna make the funniest shorts that

00:22:53.910 --> 00:23:00.260
you, that you have. It was really an agenda
there, to do that. And, and that's what they

00:23:00.260 --> 00:23:05.420
did. You're right. Disney wasn't really doing
funny. They had actually by the late 30s abandoned

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:09.540
it. They were doing, by then they were doing
fairy tales and stories. If you really look

00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:14.040
at their shorts, they're -- even the Mickey
Mouse shorts, which has gags in them, are

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:19.120
story driven. Like the one where he's the
"Brave Little Tailor", and there's one where

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.011
he goes through the looking glass. They were
very story driven, and then the Silly Symphonies

00:23:24.011 --> 00:23:28.160
Series, they were doing was also of course
fairytales. And a lot of other competitors

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.960
said, "Well, we'll follow Disney in doing
fairytales", and then you get a lot of again

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.450
in the late 30s -- there's Happy Harmonies
and Color Rhapsodies and these are the names

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:40.560
of the other cartoons from the other studios.
They just started copying Disney in a different

00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560
way.

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:47.840
Warner's just decided, "Let's break the fourth
wall. Let's be the Marx Brothers of the cartoon

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:52.840
world and let's, let's expand that." I mean,
that's, that, that was the thinking and that's

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.850
what they really ended up doing. And it really
 -- in the years from 35 to 40, they're there

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.270
 -- you could see the experimentation happening
and they're growing cartoon by cartoon. And

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:08.020
by the time we hit 1940 and we hit Bugs Bunny.
And by the way, yesterday was Bugs Bunny's,

00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:13.280
Bugs Bunny's what? Bugs Bunny's 70th birthday.
It was his literally the day of his release

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:17.060
was yesterday, of the first, of the one that's
considered the first Bugs Bunny cartoon. The

00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:23.950
first time he said, "What's up?" or "What's
up Doc?" "A Wild Hare" came out July 27, 1940.

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:28.470
And that's really the beginning right there
with that cartoon we're hitting the Warner

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:34.000
Bros. we all know. The one for the next 20
years they're making these. They've got it

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.800
down and, and, and they're running with the
ball. And what was great was they had the

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:45.600
facility of the Warner Bros. Studio, the music
of the Warner Bros. Studio. They had the outlet

00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:50.212
of, of, of the movie theaters to make these
films for. And really unlike today they didn't

00:24:50.212 --> 00:24:55.220
have executive interference. There was nobody
in the front office telling them how to make

00:24:55.220 --> 00:25:00.330
these cartoons or make more of these. Maybe
they said, "Make more Bugs Bunny's" ľ maybe

00:25:00.330 --> 00:25:06.060
that or "Tasmanian Devil's popular. Make some
more of that." But that's about it. They got,

00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.960
they got, they were able to make them for
themselves, what they thought was funny.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.701
People ask me all the time -- here's the big
question people ask me all the time. "How

00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:17.750
come they can't make them anymore like that
even when they try? At Warner Bros., why aren't

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:22.190
they, why can't they do that. They can't.
How come they can't recapture-" Tthey can't

00:25:22.190 --> 00:25:25.700
and you know why it's the same ľ I've come
to the conclusion it's the same thing like

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:31.430
ľ I'm trying to pick analogies -- like the
Beatles or, I like Marvel comics of the 60s.

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:35.790
You know, Marvel comics of the 60s if you
know that or the Beatles. These were specific

00:25:35.790 --> 00:25:43.840
people -- the four Beatles, and Stanley, and
Jack Kirby and Gene Colon and Steve Ditco.

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:53.660
Certain people at that specific time and that
place, making these particular things. I-I-I

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.570
think that's the thing it was those people.
It was Mel Blanc's voices. It was Chuck Jones.

00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:05.920
It was Friz Freleng. It was Carl Stalling's
music. It was the sound effects. It was just

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.000
those particular people at that particular
time in that particular place made, equaled

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.250
making these cartoons this great. And it's
really hard for the newer generation to do

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.970
it. I'd prefer when I talk to younger people,
"Don't, don't do it. Make new stuff, do cool

00:26:21.970 --> 00:26:27.390
new things." There's so many new things that
can be done or move forward. I think if somehow

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:33.650
they were able to retain their eternal youth
of their ages in the 40s and 50s and were

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.641
to continue into the 60s and 70s and 80s they
would still have evolved -- the cartoons.

00:26:37.641 --> 00:26:41.960
When people say "Bugs Bunny wouldn't do this
or do that" -- I don't know because when you

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.880
look at the early Bugs Bunny's and you look
at the late ones, a character evolved. That's

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:50.080
true of Daffy Duck and of all of them. They
all sort of changed by the late 50s and yet

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.660
they're still good. They're still funny. They
may even be funnier. The character of Daffy

00:26:54.660 --> 00:27:02.690
Duck is hilarious by the late 50s when he's
that, he's that egotistical foil for Bugs

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:06.210
Bunny. That's a great character. That wasn't
the character that they originally started

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:11.620
with. But that happened with all of them.
So anyway, that's, that's my answer to that

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:12.620
question

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.820
We had some of the questions over there

00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.790
narrator: I just wanted to check if anybody
over the VC had a question. Mountainview?

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:19.860
Go ahead.

00:27:19.860 --> 00:27:24.720
translator for
male#2: Oh hi. Yes. I'm probably about the

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:36.780
same age as you are. And what I 'm afraid
of is that with Disney pushing back the copyright

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.920
deadlines, the fact is that we'll never live
to see this content released to the public.

00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:46.700
And I am wondering if you have the same fears?

00:27:46.700 --> 00:27:55.180
Jerry: Well I have the same -- fears I wouldn't
call it. I guess I'm an optimist, but I-I-I-I

00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:02.951
agree with you, I'm-I'm not a big fan of this
extension of copyright. At Warners, they're

00:28:02.951 --> 00:28:08.860
very protective of it. I actually go into
meetings with them and, and, and they're aware,

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:14.650
they're aware -- they actually want this stuff
out there so that, that others won't bootleg

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:15.870
it and that and that sort of thing.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:22.030
And as long as a company makes the material
accessible, I personally have no problem with

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:27.770
them owning it. That's my thing. And on the
other hand, we have companies like, I don't

00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:32.280
want to name names but I guess I will because
I'll happily call them out. Sony, Sony Pictures,

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:38.680
right now. They own Mr. Magoo. Viacom has
Betty Boop and Mighty Mouse. They have tons

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.990
of these cartoons that are nowhere to be seen.
There's some -- you'll go out and say, "Well

00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.100
I just got a DVD of Betty Boop." Yeah, there's
literally a handful of public domain ones

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:51.980
that people put out. But there's like 105
Betty Boop cartoons and they're, they're beautiful

00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:56.340
and they should be restored. They should do
what Warners has done with and Disney has

00:28:56.340 --> 00:29:00.660
done with restoring their their --. I have
to give credit to Disney -- except for "Song

00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:04.900
of the South". I don't think there's a, I'm
sure there's somebody who could name one or

00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:08.950
something later, but I don't think there's
any of their shorts -- well there might be

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.790
a few but there aren't any of their shorts
they haven't put out and, and features. They

00:29:12.790 --> 00:29:18.210
put everything out immaculately restored.
And on the shorts side, they've put out a

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:23.100
fantastic set I highly recommend you finding
called "On The Home Front" which is the war

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:28.950
time cartoons featuring "Der Fuehrer's Face"
which is Donald Duck dreaming he's a Nazi.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:34.170
These are cartoons they had suppressed for
50 years. There's a whole bunch of cartoons

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:39.100
on there that are things they did not want
to let out a la "Song of the South" that are

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:44.170
on there, but they've put all of those things
out now and I give them credit for that.

00:29:44.170 --> 00:29:50.980
I don't like this copyright extension thing.
It's ridiculous. And I just -- I guess I do

00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:56.910
have the fear that it will happen again in
25 years, but I just hope that if the cartoons

00:29:56.910 --> 00:30:02.200
are accessible, I think that's what's great
about the internet is that, is that -- at

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.920
least they realize there's some kind of revenue
stream and they can put them out digitally

00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:10.610
and put them on Hulu or whatever and, and
make them available and hopefully make some

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:14.740
money. As long as they make them accessible,
that's all I care about personally.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.840
male#3: Why did they stop?

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:23.000
Jerry: Stop what? Making Warner Bros. cartoons?
Back in the old days? Yeah, they stopped several

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:29.170
times. The first time was mainly 1962. That
was the big stop and mainly it was because

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:34.970
there was the perception that they weren't
making very much money by renting them to

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:39.030
movie theaters for five dollars. That's actually
what they, five or ten dollars was all it

00:30:39.030 --> 00:30:43.450
cost a movie theater, one movie theater, to
play a cartoon for a week. And that, that

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:50.840
market was disappearing in the 60s. So, they
 -- basically they didn't see the return of

00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:54.870
their investment. Again, it was kind of old
school thinking. They were thinking just theatrically

00:30:54.870 --> 00:31:00.440
and they weren't really factoring in the future
and television, but still. So, they closed

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.700
the studio down. They -- if everybody remembers
that movie the "Incredible Mr. Limpet", that

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:10.390
was the last thing that was done by the old
Warner Bros. cartoon studio. They, they stopped

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:15.360
 -- making shorts, they made that feature
the animation for that and they -- and then

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:22.160
and then they closed the doors. And it's been
open and closed all throughout the years.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.220
They've done some other cartoons since, but
they've always kept a kind of departments.

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.980
In some years, that department was one person
who was, who was, who was literally there

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:36.970
 -- an editor who would just edit the Saturday
morning Bugs Bunny Show and that was the one

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:41.650
employee of the Warner Bros. So, it kind of
always existed even, even when there was nobody

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:42.820
really working there. Strange.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:43.820
Yes.

00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:48.850
male#4: Do you think there's still a market
for the, for new cartoons in this format a

00:31:48.850 --> 00:31:54.710
la kind of like short Looney Tunes, slapstick
kind of style. Or maybe not even slapstick,

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.760
but just like that particular format? Cause
we really don't see that.

00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:04.210
Jerry: No, I mean yes and no. I mean on the
one hand, one of the most popular things on

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:12.030
the internet is short animation. But that's,
it's being used on mobile media and all sorts

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:18.040
of things. There is a market for people doing
shorts more than ever, more than ever these

00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:24.590
days. Itĺs a great way to be seen or get
your name known if you create the next great

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:32.370
internet sensation. Warner Bros. Well, Pixar
is of course doing shorts which they put with

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:38.280
their, with their feature films and they do
it to develop talent at the studio. And they

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.840
have all kinds of reasons to try experimental
things with the shorts and that's exactly

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:47.630
what Disney did back in the 30s with his Silly
Symphonies. That's exactly what those were.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:52.270
Warner Bros. for whatever reason they've -- and
Fitz and Starts has been doing this for about

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:57.380
ten-fifteen years now. They had Chuck Jones
doing some shorts at the end of his life that

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:03.400
they occasionally showed with a film. And
right now they've revitalized their little

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:08.430
animation division that does mainly TV cartoons
like the Batman animated series. "The Brave

00:33:08.430 --> 00:33:17.810
and the Bold" and as part of that, they commissioned
an animator in that unit to work on three-three

00:33:17.810 --> 00:33:25.130
minute long Roadrunner cartoons. And the first
of which is going to be released this week

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:33.450
with a movie I don't want to see. Called "Cats
and Dogs" -- whatever "Cats and Dogs II".

00:33:33.450 --> 00:33:38.820
And they're going to release one of these
Roadrunner shorts with the next three family

00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:42.440
films they put out. I think the Yogi Bear
film at the end of the year will have one

00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:48.600
as well. And I've seen them and they're in
3D. They're Roadrunner, and they're very well

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:54.700
done. They, they don't violate or hurt the
memory of the classic character. They are

00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:59.830
perfectly in league with it. They actually
use the space of 3D. I-I-I actually think

00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:03.830
it's kind of brilliant in retrospect I don't
think they even thought about it. The whole

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:08.560
desert settings and the up top -- the mountains.
It really works in 3D. And they also have

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:12.540
the characters reach out into the screen,
which nobody seems to want to do anymore with

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:17.720
3D. So, there really is there- they're only
3 minutes and it's just the chas- it's just

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:21.880
like three gags and a regular Roadrunner cartoon
but they're really great. And the explosions

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:27.389
in 3D when the coyote gets blown up in the
stereo 3-dimensional explosions -- actually

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:35.820
it's funnier. They're just bigger explosions
so it actually makes it funny again.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:38.320
Any other questions before we have to go back
to work?

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:40.409
Oh, they left.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:42.510
narrator: They left.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.760
Jerry: They're gone.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.620
narrator: They probably had to give up the
room at one.

00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.470
Jerry: All right well we don't have to do
that down here in Southern California.

00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:49.850
narrator: No. We we're good. Anyone else have
another question?

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.040
Jerry: We have, we have one last one.

00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:56.090
male #5: Just a minor question about, I remember
a lot of cartoons of course don't know their

00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:00.470
names, sorry. So this is so the people on
VC can hear my question.

00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:02.070
[everyone laughs]

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:09.050
Oh, okay, just kidding. So I remember one
cartoon in particular, where it was Daffy

00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:11.800
Duck and there was an animator and he's erasing
him and different thingsů

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.410
Jerry: Oh, yeah. "Duck Amuck" It's in the
book.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:16.920
male #5: "Duck Amuck" Okay, I didn't get a
copy of the book. I was just curious what

00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:18.420
the name of that was.

00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:24.370
Jerry: Oh, okay. I can't say I'm a 100% expert
on every title but the Roadrunners are really

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:27.380
hard, because the titles really don't mean
anything.

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.630
male #6: Since we're playing "Name That Cartoon"ů

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:31.260
Jerry: Yes. There is a gameů

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:37.090
male #6: I seem to remember a cartoon where
Roadrunner, I think it was Roadrunner had

00:35:37.090 --> 00:35:39.500
to, had to take a day off and Bugs Bunny took
overů

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500
Jerry: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:44.200
male #6: And I've never been able to find
anybody even remembering that.

00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200
Jerry: ůit's oh, actually they I think theyů

00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.980
male #6: But that did happen? Right? And I
think that Speedy Gonzalez showed up in a

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980
cameo role or something.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.220
Jerry: I think that one -- that one's actually
a really sad one to me, because that doesn't

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.550
work. It was like a good idea, but it didn't
work as a cartoon. It was, so Bugs Bunny is

00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:57.660
like the Roadrunner in that cartoon, right?

00:35:57.660 --> 00:35:58.660
male #6: Yes, a stand-in.

00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:02.510
Jerry: It's weird. I think it's called -- I'd
have to get my other book, my big guide with

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.950
every title. But I think it's called "Compressed
Hare." You can look that one up on the internet.

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:07.260
I think that's the name of it. It's-Its

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.620
male #6: It's not that oneů

00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:12.120
Jerry: No, it isn't. It's pretty -- it's one
of those ones that's -- the one I ľ the worst,

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:18.070
the one I, my least favorite Bugs Bunny cartoon
is one called "Pre-Hysterical Hare". It's

00:36:18.070 --> 00:36:23.450
so bad. It's, it's one where he, I don't even
remember the exact plot. But they're looking

00:36:23.450 --> 00:36:31.110
at films of prehistoric man -- Bugs Bunny
is I guess and he sees Elmer Fuddstone versus

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:37.360
a Neanderthal Bugs Bunny. And this is the
first cartoon where the guy Arthur Q. Bryan,

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:41.640
who was the voice of Elmer Fudd, had just
died. So they got in somebody else to do the

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:47.730
voice and the voice is like pathetic, "Bugs
Bunny" It's really bad and Bugs Bunny is like

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:51.830
a Neanderthal so they drew him a strange way.
It's ugly looking. It's got the wrong voice

00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:56.671
for Elmer Fudd. It's a Robert McKimsom. It's
a very late one. It's like oy - this is like,

00:36:56.671 --> 00:36:59.140
like to me the worst Bugs Bunny cartoon. In
case you were wondering.

00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:00.140
Male#7: It just missed it.

00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:01.710
Jerry: What's that the last?

00:37:01.710 --> 00:37:05.686
male #7: The last few they made just kind
of missed it.

00:37:05.686 --> 00:37:09.000
Jerry: Yeah, they were, they kind of knew
it was over toward the end there, but um.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.500
audience member: It's on YouTube.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500
Jerry: Which one?

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500
male #7: Which one?

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.500
Jerry: "Compressed Hare"

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500
audience member: "Compressed Hare"

00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.500
Jerry: Is that the one with the Bugs Bunnyů

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:16.500
audience member: Bugs Bunnyů

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.880
Jerry: ůand and then Wyle E. Coyote. Yeah,
my favorite, one of my absolute favorite Bugs

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:23.780
Bunny's -- and I have too many, too. If I
think about it, one of my super favorites

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:30.380
is in here is a Wyle E. Coyote "Super Genius"
which is called "Operation Rabbit". Yeah "Operation

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:39.270
Rabbit". That's really a funny, funny cartoon
in every, every shot. And I can go on and

00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:40.270
on. Buy my book.

00:37:40.270 --> 00:37:41.920
Male #8: One more "Name That Cartoon"ů

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.040
Jerry: Okay, one more.

00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:48.130
male #8: ůBugs Bunny and he was in some type
of Roman Coliseum or something.

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:52.600
Jerry: Yeah -- I think that one's "Roman Legion
Hare" off hand. I think that's the name of

00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.600
it.

00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.460
male#8: "Roman Legion Hare"? There's one part
where he says, "How now, Brown cow." and that's

00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.460
all I remember.

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.460
Jerry: I think that's that one.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:37:59.460
male#8: Okay.

00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:00.460
[laughter]

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.511
Jerry: That one's a little easy.

00:38:01.511 --> 00:38:04.060
narrator: Stump the historian.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:08.270
Jerry: This is the kind of class I hope to
teach someday. With just people asking me,

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:10.790
"What's the name of the one withů?"
Then I get to, okay.

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:16.780
audience member: What was the John and Mary
one?

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:17.780
Jerry: John and Mary?

00:38:17.780 --> 00:38:19.100
audience member: Mary! John! Mary! John!

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:21.020
Jerry: Ohhh, thatĺs a gag in a cartoon.

00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:25.194
audience member: There was another piece by
a different comic card scheme.

00:38:25.194 --> 00:38:28.970
Jerry: There's a cartoon that it isn't it,
but there was one called "Wild Wife", which

00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:33.200
is Czech, which is a really good one. But
I don't think, I don't think that's it. But

00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:36.650
that's == one that features two human characters
and it's all about, it's all about from a

00:38:36.650 --> 00:38:41.120
woman's point of view about what a hectic
day she has while he's out at work. And she

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:45.190
just explains, itĺs all about her talking
about her day. Itĺs a very odd cartoon with

00:38:45.190 --> 00:38:49.800
human characters in it. Anyway and I think
they're called John and Mary. It's called

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:56.020
"Wild Wife". It's actually one of my, I like
that one just for the oddness of it. I'm pro-,

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.010
it's very hard to find one that I don't like.
I've mentioned one already and -- but most

00:39:00.010 --> 00:39:02.180
of these I really love.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:07.960
narrator: Cool. Well, Jerry will sign books,
if you'd like to. And I have another box of

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:12.440
books that's being held up by FedEx. So, if
you didn't get a book, make sure I get your

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:16.630
name and, and we'll get you a book. So, thanks
very much Jerry for comingů

00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:17.630
Jerry: Thank you.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:18.630
[applause]

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.700
Jerry: Thank you.
