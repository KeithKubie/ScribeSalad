00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Hi, Internet. My name is Tamera Chambers, and this is Tamara's Never Seen!

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.200
Today, I am watching Demolition Man.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.560
Demolition Man was one of my favorite reviews to be a part of for Nostalgia Critic.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.200
So I'm...I'm pretty excited to watch the film that I had so much fun, you know, making fun of.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.000
Okay, on Twitter, I said give me those Demolition Man predictions for the next 20 minutes.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.260
Also, here's a skateboarding cat in deep thought. Thanks!

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.580
It's really cute. It's a really cute cat.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.680
So here we go! We're gonna watch Demolition Man! Let's do it!

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.640
Yeah, that had the same kind of cheesy fun that Judge Dredd had,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.640
but honestly, Sylvester Stallone was so much better in this.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.300
Like, way better, way more likeable.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.460
The story was hilarious. It's always funny to see how the future is portrayed,

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.800
especially like from, you know, 20 years ago.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.360
I love one of Stallone's first lines, "Send a maniac to catch one."

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.760
I identify with that.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.400
I'm coming for you, Ike!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.220
So in the beginning of the movie, you see that Wesley Snipes is the bad guy

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.080
and Sylvester Stallone is the good cop

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.520
and Wesley Snipes frames Sylvester Stallone,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.460
but, Wesley snipes is wearing Bill pants the whole time.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.380
Bill was first! Been there since the beginning, y'all.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.240
Sylvester Stallone is sentenced to 70 years

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.120
in kai-ro... kr... kai-ro-gen-ic...

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.540
Is that... Is that the word? Kairogenic prison? [laughs] Where they freeze you?

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.780
That's just some Fallout 4 shit, y'all!

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.900
Stallone is placed in this... cryogenic gel.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.360
In a very... arousing scene? [laughs] Strangely enough.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.780
I can't believe that that is like a sentencing!

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.160
Like, I want to be placed in that gel and awoken in 70 years.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:02.799
The future is going to be awesome!

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.570
They're gonna have a cure for diabetes.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.500
Cats are going to be able to talk.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.500
Fallout 5 will finally be out.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.820
I ranked those in order, by the way.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.920
So, flash forward, you see the future, 2032,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.500
and it's hilarious and awesome.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.700
You see Sandra Bullock, who is a treasure, and you see...

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.780
Mother

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.220
[Censored]

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.120
Rob Schneider

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.940
[Censored]

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.200
Thankfully Rob Schneider is not in this movie very much.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:39.320
He's like the "receptionist" at the police station, and he's got two or three or four lines, not many,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.720
and he didn't get on my nerves like I thought that he would.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.060
Also he didn't do any weird mouth opening thing, so that's.... crushing it.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.600
Sandra's character is, she's a young cop and she's longing for action in his peaceful world.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.200
She's got a Lethal Weapon 3 poster on her wall from "the past."

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.960
She's got skinny nineties eyebrows, and I love her.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.080
And no I've not seen Lethal Weapon 3.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.540
Or 2

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.020
[quietly] Or 1.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.200
[whip]

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.200
Wesley Snipes' character, Phoenix, is defrosted, comes out,

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.440
and kills a bunch of people, and they haven't had a murder in like 23 years.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.580
Honestly Rob Schneider had a great line here.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.160
"We're police officers. We aren't trained to handle violence like this!"

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.840
So, they decide the only person that can take out Phoenix is Sylvester Stallone's character,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.300
so they unfreeze Demolition Man.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.200
I love his wake up scene!

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.160
He finds out that, like, caffeine and alcohol and meat is illegal,

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.640
and I take back what I said about wanting to be frozen and sent to the future.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.440
Can't do it. No, thank you. I refuse that life.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.240
And then I wrote, "Oh my God, the three seashells!" [laughs]

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.440
What the hell?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.160
I'm gonna give you my ideas on what I think the three seashells is, and means.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.460
Okay, now. I am.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.600
Okay. first idea. You know those really tacky souvenir soaps that you get

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.480
when you visit a beach town that are shaped like seashells?

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.040
Maybe they're just little soaps and you just, like, delicately caress your bottom with them.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.832
Alright first idea is done. Dope. Great. Come at me.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.640
Second idea. Maybe,

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.300
since it's the future and so many things are different, maybe seashells are different now, too.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.480
Maybe they're like sea sponges in the shapes of shells.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.240
So maybe they're just cute little sponges that you delicately caress your bottom with.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.960
Again. Done. Nailed it. Boom.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.280
All right, number three.

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.080
Um...

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:43.720
Ah...

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.480
Hmm...

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.700
Maybe there's a live animal in the seashell, like a little clam or an oyster,

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.460
and he just, like, spits water at you,

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.080
and delicately spits water on your bottom after you go to the bathroom.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.580
Boom!

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.680
Crushing it!

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.820
Sandra has this incredible line about the way that Stallone interacted with somebody and it's so funny.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.120
She said, "If you read my study you'd know this is how insecure hetero males used to bond."

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.300
Oh, shots fired!

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.360
I love the bad word violations that go off every few seconds when Sylvester Stallone says a bad word.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.100
"Verbal morality." [beep] that.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.180
Also, the Commercials Oldies radio station is hilarious, but the more funny part of that, I think,

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.940
is that radio still exists in 2032.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.260
So Sylvester and Sandra go to a museum, which is the only place that they have guns anymore.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.580
Well a museum in this COUCH!

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.300
[drum beat] Damn! Oh Shit!

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.600
[drums stop] And they're looking for Phoenix.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.240
In this portion of the movie there were just a lot of funny things with the future.

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.180
The pope looking guy invites them to Taco Bell for saving him.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.360
I wonder if they have the Doritos Locos taco, because if not, again, not a future I want to be a part of.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:03.040
But it's revealed that Taco Bell is the only restaurant left.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.920
There's like, valet parking, and there's champagne, a piano player...

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.200
Changed my mind again, I want to be in his future.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.040
Sandra reveals that Schwarzenegger had been president in the past and

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.460
Sylvester Stallone is, like, pissed, and it's so funny and somehow very topical,

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.020
and that is all I will say on that matter.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.560
So, on the way home from their delightful Taco Bell dinner,

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.200
Stallone and Sandra are talking about his daughter, who is still alive, and he's worried about seeing her again.

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.839
And I, I really wish that they went with the storyline that

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.600
Sandra was his daughter, and and that she wasn't going to be, like, his love interest.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.840
I'm only halfway through the film at this point, but I was pretty sure that's where that was going.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.600
And then the sex scene happens, which is so weird, so funny!

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.480
Surprisingly a tasteful sex scene.

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.530
"Fluid transfer" is outlawed, and that makes sense. If people called sex "fluid transfer",

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.200
I'd want it to be outlawed as well.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:00.260
This is where you find out that the pope looking guy needs Wesley Snipes, Phoenix, to take out the leader of the Scraps.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.160
[to the tune of "Leader of the Pack"] "The leader of the Scraps!"

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.159
Stallone decides to just take matters into his own hands,

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:11.539
and he goes down to address the Scraps and to find Phoenix,

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.620
and he ends up having a rat burger and a beer, and it's really funny.

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.440
Then after that It's just a giant action sequence.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.420
Wesley Snipes, Phoenix, goes and kills the pope looking guy.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.420
Sandra Bullock! Good god above!

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:28.780
She beats up all these people, she kills someone, she totally proves that she's an awesome fighter,

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.180
and then, before they go in,

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.140
to take on

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.560
Phoenix,

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.800
Sylvester Stallone, like,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.600
shocks her and and and she passes out because he's like "I did that for your own good."

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.480
[imitates Stallone] "The Law!"

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.900
"I know you just proved yourself, you're a good fighter and that you'll do whatever to keep ourselves safe

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:52.580
"but, you know, I gotta do this on my own, 'cause I'm a good, like, macho dude, bleh."

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.520
Stallone takes out Phoenix, and everyone is saved and it was a really cool fight, really great way to take him out.

00:07:59.540 --> 00:08:01.920
I loved the end, with the freezing.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.980
But again, at the end,

00:08:04.460 --> 00:08:07.920
Sandra's like, "So I thought we were a team, bra."

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.100
He's like "Yeah, we were. Was for your own good."

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:15.680
She's like, "I don't think that's... that's not really... nah. I don't agree."

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.160
And then he like, twirls her around and kisses her. It's like, "Oh cool."

00:08:19.889 --> 00:08:24.180
Solves everything. [whispers] No, it does't. [normal] It didn't bother me a ton, but it was just like,

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.380
Why was that? Why did it have to go that way?

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.320
But, I did love this movie.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.440
I predict that the predictions will be full of three seashells things.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:39.240
"You'll want a prequel movie that chronicles The Franchise Wars in all their gory details."

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:44.380
Yes! How did Taco Bell win? Weren't all of their soldiers sick all the time?

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:47.060
'Cause all they ate was Taco Bell?

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.500
"You will find it weird they predicted it right, that Arnold Schwarzenegger would go into politics."

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.200
Yes! "Also three seashells. What the fuck?" [laughs]

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:01.560
Yeah, seems like a lot of you really wanted to know about the three seashells. [laughs]

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.700
Same. Same.

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:07.800
"When you see the big guy from Beetlejuice, all you can picture is him reading from the Book of the Recently Deceased."

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.340
I get that reference now!

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.300
Bing!

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:15.740
"Stallone clearly wins the... "penis game." [laughs]

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.020
Yes, I finally get that reference that Doug and Rob make at the studio all the time!

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:22.520
"Penis!"

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:25.180
"I don't care about Demolition Man, but cat!"

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.820
I had such a good time with this movie. I thought Wesley Snipes was

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.060
awesome!

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:33.400
Stallone was so much [beep] better in this than in...

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.700
Judge Dredd.

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.420
Sandra Bullock, a treasure. Cherish her. Protect her at all costs.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.000
Next week. I might watch an Edgar Wright film.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.200
'Cause I loved Baby Driver so much and I'm still on that hype train from that.

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.774
Look out on my Twitter for more predictions and I'll probably be putting up a poll sometime this week

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:53.740
about what my next movie should be.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:57.540
Thank you so much for watching. I'll see you guys next week. Bye!

00:09:57.540 --> 00:09:58.500
What the [beep]?

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.240
[music]
