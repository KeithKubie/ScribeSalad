Speaker 1:          00:01          So we'll finish up on Nmr spectroscopy, talking about more dynamic things in involving decoupling than a little bit about [inaudible] 13 Nmr and, and double labeling involving correlation. And then we'll get onto another reaction. Electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Speaker 2:          00:23          Um, let's go at on here.

Speaker 1:          00:32          Okay, so proton decoupling, remember that the Proton is, uh, four times as strong a magnet as, as the carbon 13, so it precess as much faster. So it's easy to do a pulse that that will tilt the carbon 13 a net magnetization down into the plane so that it'll precess and be an antenna that can tell us it's local field without doing the same thing to the Proton. And if we do that, then we see the [inaudible] at Mr Spectrum. Uh, and there are two peaks because of the adjacent Proton, right? It can be either up or down 50, 50, and are almost exactly 50, 50. So you see two peaks. Now, suppose at the same time you're doing that when you do this pulse and listened to the [inaudible] to see what is local field is you irradiate at a hundred mega hertz, right? That don't do anything to the c 13.

Speaker 1:          01:29          It's the wrong frequency, but it will now make the proton precess. That is, if we look in the rotating frame, we can see us a weak field that's horizontal about which the, uh, the magnetism will precess a little go there, protons will go down and then up and then down and then up. Uh, and what determines how fast it goes up and down, how strong this field is. The stronger it is, the faster it will precess. And if it's fast enough, then you won't see a doublet for the [inaudible] anymore because you'll see the average, right? So you'll see a single peak, you'll proton decouple the c 13 spectrum and see the [inaudible] as if the protons weren't there. Uh, okay. So it depends on how much power you put in. Now here's a c 13 spectrum of a given compound. Uh, where we're putting, we're looking at the seat listening to the c 13, and we see all these different local fields, right?

Speaker 1:          02:29          But we're irradiating the proton at the same time, but very, very weakly. This number up there. 40 decibels is an inverse ratio of how strong that horizontal field is for the protons. So it's 10 to the fourth weaker than what you'll see later. 10,000 times weaker. And if we look at the carbon, we see that there's that some of the carbons signals are split and some are not split. The ones that are split are the ones that have hydrogens on them. So if we start from the left, we see there's one with hydrogens, then one with one hydrogen, one with one hydrogen. That red one is the solvent CDCL three, right? So we're looking at the carbon of the, of the CDC, l three but it has a deuterium on it, not a hydrogen, so it's not split. Then there's a carbon with two hydrogens, a carbon with three hydrogens.

Speaker 1:          03:20          It's a quartet underneath the carbon with two hydrogens. It's a triplet. So that's very low power and the Proton, that's what we see. Now we're going to reduce the size of that and see what happens as we start increasing the power. So there's 40 DB, 20 db, and now things are beginning to change. See how the patterns are changing their multiplicity and their intensity. Because it turns out that when you irradiate, when you irradiate the protons by a complicated mechanism, it strengthens the signal of the carbons to which they're coupled. And that's called nuclear Overhauser enhancement, as you'll see. Okay? So now you'll see the splittings going away. When we get down to two decibels or one decibel. Now we see that each carbon gives just a single peak. We've decoupled the protons. So now we have a peak for every carbon. And notice incidentally, that the CDCL three didn't get stronger as we did this.

Speaker 1:          04:22          Why? Because what strengthened the signal was irradiating the protons and CDC l three doesn't have the hydrogens on it, so it doesn't get strengthened. Okay? And no notice also that the carbon without a hydrogen on it though, the far left here didn't get strengthened as much as the others did. Okay? So that's decoupling and it can be useful and it can be useful in several ways. There's this thing I called nuclear, there's the two things. You get rid of the hyperflex, the you get rid of the spins, spin. Splitting. So you see just a peak for each carbon and also you strengthen the signals when they have nearby protons, right? And that could be bad if you're interested in measuring the size of the peaks to get how many carbons there are, because you can't count properly anymore because you get different intensities with different neighbors of protons.

Speaker 1:          05:12          But it's good if you want to determine structure and see what hydrogens are how far away. And I'll show you that shortly. Okay? Now, uh, Merritt bear in mind that carbon 13 is only 1% in natural abundance of carbon. Of course, you can synthesize a molecule with expensive carbon 13 containing precursors and put carbon 13 where you want it in a molecule. And then the signal from that carbon will be ever so much stronger. If you put in pure carbon c 13, in some position, the signal would be a hundred times stronger. In fact, 200 times stronger than without. Because when the carbon went, uh, because uh, uh, no part of it, it'd be a, it would be a be a 100 times stronger because we 100% instead of 1%. Okay? So here's a, here's a, a, a compound neo tame. It's an artificial sweetener and it's the, uh, it's the proton decoupled.

Speaker 1:          06:08          See 13 spectrum. So you see one peak for each carbon, there are 20 carbons, there are 20 peaks, but you can't go by their intensities, okay? Now let's see what we can make of this. Uh, it's proton decoupled. So there's one peak for carbon and being carbon. It's pretty well spread out. Remember the range of hydrogen, uh, chemical shifts is only about 10 parts per million. The range for carbon is hundreds of parts per million. Here, 200 parts per million are shown. Okay? Now, why is there no see 13 [inaudible] 13 splitting. There's no proton splitting cause this decoupled, but why no [inaudible] see 13 splitting

Speaker 2:          06:51          Jason at the same molecule.

Speaker 1:          06:54          It's only 1% natural abundance. And you're a c 13 so that you're giving a signal the chance that your neighbor is, see 13 is only 1% so there would be tiny, tiny peaks from those. You don't see them. Okay, so that's what Chris just said. Okay, now let's see if we can figure out which proteins, which a carbons these are that we're looking at. And of course this is how it was done. Empirically. People put in known compounds and figured out what the chemical shifts, what peaks were from one compound to the next thing they figured out. This comes in this range and this comes in this range. This comes in this range. So let us see knowing what these peaks are. Okay? First, there are these ones that are way down close to 200 right? There are numbers one 13 and four so what the one 13 and four have in common that turns out to make them way far down field

Speaker 2:          07:48          alimony. What the one 13 and 14 have in common that makes them different than the other carpets.

Speaker 1:          08:01          Double Bond to an o, right? Carbonyl carbons are way down field. Okay? Now we've got a seven and eight to 12 so there's seven and there's eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Pretty clear what those are, right? Those are the ones on a benzene ring. Aromatic carbons. Okay. Then there are ones that are a little bit further down than the others. And those are those blue ones. What do they have in common role? What do you say they have in common? They're not all tertiary. No. In fact, most of the only, only uh, one of them has only two of them have three things associated with them. The others have

Speaker 2:          08:41          one and two. Lauren, could you see what the blue ones have in common

Speaker 1:          08:50          in hydrogen? What makes things come a little bit further down field?

Speaker 3:          08:55          And I knew he would be like you like from the [inaudible]. I'm like [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          09:03          They all have an electronegative atom next to them, right? Nitrogen or oxygen. Okay. So those are one's a carbon that's attached to something I liked her negative. And then finally you have the others which are attached only to carbons. Okay. So you could begin to figure out these and you can get the tables of what comes where and then you can start dealing with unknown compounds and figure out what it's telling you. But a nice thing about this proton decoupled spectrum is that there's just one peak for each car been in there, well spread out so that it's good to do this kind of thing. So those are the Alkane carbons. Okay? Now the power of correlation, often when you could measure two things about on the same subject, simultaneously, you get a lot more information than measuring one or measuring the other or measuring them independently. I'll show you that example with [inaudible] 13 double labeling. And also in two dimensional is it's called nuclear magnetic resonance. So first see 13 double labeling. So, and we'll talk about [inaudible] biogenesis. In fact, we already talked about it. If you look back at the lecture 52 okay, so remember we got squalene from Isis [inaudible] pirate phosphate that it curled around and we had this complicated thing where it's zipped up going one way and then it, then we had all these rearrangements.

Speaker 1:          10:25          Okay? So, as we said at that time, this is the source of cholesterol in the steroid hormones. And it's a very cute story how all that rearrangement took place. Okay. But there's a question whether it's true, and I said at that time, wait for Nmr. So now we're at Nmr so you can get the answer. Okay? So you can use carbon 13 labeling to figure this out. So if you feed the plant that makes this stuff, uh, carbon 13 labeled ISO Penn Tino pyro phosphate in that particular carbon that substituted carbon, then you can see where that would appear in the [inaudible]. And according to the way we linked them together before it should be those carbons. Then when you curl it around and do all this stuff to make an Austral, those peaks should be labeled with [inaudible] and therefore a hundred times stronger than the other peaks in that spectrum.

Speaker 1:          11:24          And indeed they are. So that supports it. Okay. Or you could do it a different way. You could label the methyl group and if you label the methyl group, it turns out that those methyl groups should be labeled in squad lead. And then if you curl it around, it should be those methyl groups and indeed there hundred times stronger than the other signals. But much more interesting than this is to do double labeling. Okay? So if you label both, you get that big, that's just the same information we got before, right? Except done in one experiment rather than two. And of course, in a sense, this is not as valuable as the two independent label experiments because you don't know. But what two of those carbons might in principle of changed places, right? But the double labeling is much more important if you do it dilute.

Speaker 1:          12:16          Now what do I mean dilute? I've been talking as if we put 100% see 13 in here. But suppose we only, we don't put nearly a hundred percent. Suppose we only put 10% in, right? But suppose that those 10% that are labeled r double labelled. So we prepare a sample that's 100% labeled in two positions, but then we mix it with 90% of unmetered unlabeled material and feed it to the organism and get the stuff out. Okay. So, so what we're going to do is a dilute double label. Now why do it dilute? Because then when, when label goes in, two labels go in, but it's unlikely that any given squad lead, we'll have two different positions, double labelled or two sets of positions double labelled because only 10% of the stuff is double labelled. So when a squad lead is double labelled, it'll be, it'll be labeled in just one pair of positions, a given molecule like there. Okay. So those two come labeled together. Their signal is a, is 10 times stronger cause it was, remember 10% it's 10 times stronger than it was for the ones that aren't labeled. Okay. But what's special about it? Can anybody see what's going to be special about the signal we get from these molecules that look like that?

Speaker 1:          13:45          I usually got an idea they're going to be the same. What

Speaker 2:          13:53          you're gonna be. Same purpose because they are just next extra card.

Speaker 1:          13:59          I didn't quite understand you, but I didn't pay. I was listening for special words that I didn't hear them. Sebastian, you've got a special word for us. Ah, they'll split each other. Cause now the [inaudible] are next to one another because they're not coming in at random 10% they're coming in as a pair. So now when we look up the signal from that, it's going to be, it's going to be a double doublet, right? The blue and the red ones are going to split each other. Okay. Now other molecules in the same sample will turn out to have been labeled elsewhere, for example. So that proves that those editor does a unit, right? Others will have come in there and those will also be a double doublet show that they came in as a unit. And if we go over to the other end of the molecule, those will be a double doublet.

Speaker 1:          14:44          No signals will be a double doublet. Great. What's going to be different? All right. Suppose we had that molecule right where we had a meth, I'd shift. So the carbon got away from its original neighbor. Now it won't be next to US [inaudible] 13 and it'll be just a pair of singlets instead of a double Dublin in a carbon 13 in a proton decoupled spectrum. Right? And the same thing will be true there. Okay? So this double labeling absolutely proves that these rearrangements took place, right? So those two incidentally are labelled in the same molecule, right? But they're not adjacent to one another anymore. So they don't show splitting.

Speaker 1:          15:30          And those are both labeled the ones that are adjacent to one another, but not in the same molecule. So they don't do splitting either. So this a dilute double label experiment enhances the same 12 peaks is the single label experiments did to two single label experiments, but only eight of them show spins, been splitting because their bond stay intact. So this strongly confirms that story I told you before about the rearrangement scheme. Okay? So this is the power of correlation and let's look at a different kind of power of correlation in what's called two dimensional and Mr Spectroscopy. Now, here's a two dimensional NMR spectrum. And the way it's collected is rather technical and we don't have time to go into it, but it shows that there are two different frequencies be used. And, uh, and if you go along the diagonal of this plot, those two frequencies are the same.

Speaker 1:          16:23          Okay? So what you see there when you have just a certain frequency going in is the normal spectrum you see along the diagonal. But this is the spectrum of a protein. So it's got a whole bunch of amino acids linked together like that. And we're in the range of the spectrum between six and nine where the Nh protons show up, okay? In this particular kind of molecule. Okay? So there are a whole bunch of them in this long chain and they all overlap with one another. It's very hard to tell what's going on. But if you don't have these two frequencies, you're using the same, you're looking at one while you're irradiating another one. And that affects the intensity of the one you're looking at. That's this nuclear Overhauser enhancement that we talked about where you irradiate one other things that are, it's coupled to will change their intensity.

Speaker 1:          17:14          So what we're going to do is plot on the off diagonal, how one frequency is influenced by having other frequencies in there and its intensity. Okay. So that's called an OEE or nuclear Overhauser enhancement. And it comes incidentally by through space magnetic interaction, not the stuff like we talked about, coupling where it goes through bonds. This works through space, right? So it works if you're less than about if the two protons you're looking at, the one you're looking at and the one you're tickling to see if it this one, if they're within about six angst terms of one another. Okay? So, uh, so as I said, this is mostly these Nh protons. And for one thing, one advantage of having these off diagonal peaks is there, much less congested than what's along the diagonal than the normal spectrum. Okay? So for example, we're looking here at the Nih Proton that's at 7.25 parts per million, right?

Speaker 1:          18:17          But you can see that it interacts with several other protons. It's within six songs, strums of signals that are at 8.9 8.3 8.25 7.7 right now you don't measure the exact distance. All you know is that it's close, okay? But this allows you to make a three dimensional map of the protein. All right? And the way you do it is first you have to know which Nh goes with which our group, right? So you, you see that, that Nah, the one you're looking at, the red one is close to that blue one, right? So it, it'll influence it. But the blue one is then close to H's that are in the r group. So you can tell which our group that that blue h is the thereby and which one? The Red h is near the witch, the, so the red is near, the blue is near the are.

Speaker 1:          19:11          So you know which Nh is near, which are okay. Uh, and now the way you make a map then in this way, uh, professor Lauria who does this kind of thing uses this analogy. It's like of making the map of a, of a town. If all you have is a telephone and a telephone book, okay, sometimes there's a front page that has a map of the town, then that's easy. But if you don't have the map of the town, then what you do is you just call someone at random, say hi, how are you today? Blah blah, blah, blah. Uh, could you tell me who the three of your near neighbors are? And they tell you three of their near neighbors. Okay. Then you call those people and you say hi, could you tell me who three of your near neighbors are? And they tell you, and then you call the next one, two or three a year near neighbors.

Speaker 1:          19:57          So once you know who is near what, then you can, you can see that there will be a map that will allow you to figure out what's near what, especially if you have some help. Because you know, in the case of the protons, they have to fit with normal bond distances, normal bond angles and so on. So if you do molecular mechanics together with this, knowing what's near, what, you can get a very good three dimensional structure of the protein. And the nice thing about this from the point of view of people who are actually working with proteins is you don't need, how would you, how, what's the best way of getting the three dimensional structure of something like a protein or anything x-ray. But you need a crystal for this. You don't need a crystal, okay? So you can find the structure that way.

Speaker 1:          20:42          So with molecular mechanics constraints, you get the three d structure without a crystal, okay? Now here's a different kind of two d correlation with Ed, Mr It's correlation, not in space but in time. So this is the spectrum of a cad ion, that cat eye and that's shown at the right notice. It's benzene with methyl groups all around it with one extra methyl group and a positive charge. Okay? Now in fact, you can get this and solution as long as you don't have anything that reacts with Cad Ions in there that reacts with low Lumos. So you need very, very non-basic solvents to do this. Okay? So again, the diag and all running a different way. This time that dealt the increase in parts per million is down to the right rather than what we usually see increasing to the left. But anyhow, it's color coded according to these peaks that show, that show what they are, the molecule.

Speaker 1:          21:41          So, uh, so this scale is slanted and backwards. Uh, uh, so you see that the, the, the, uh, if you look at the resonance structures, right? That one, that one, that one, you can see that the blue and the green are near where there's positive charge and the resonance structure. So they're far down field, very, uh, very de shielded compared to the others. Okay. Now, uh, this can rearrange of method can shift. So I sh there meth, I had one of the reds, red methyls on the top shifted to the right. So now the mall, now you've changed which methyl groups are in which locations, right? So now the, uh, the red one at the top, uh, this, this one and this one are now see and will be shifted way down field. This one will be shifted down. Fee will be what was blue before in the deep position.

Speaker 1:          22:44          And so on. And then this blue one, which was downfield before is now at an a, it's up here. So we changed the locations, the local frequencies, the local fields. Okay. Now, so that's a meth I'd shift. But is it a one, two meth? I'd shift because it's possible that the methyl instead of going just to its neighbor would move to the center of the ring up above the center of the ring and that it could come down anywhere, wouldn't have to come down adjacent to where it started. So you could have a one anywhere shift. Right now you can distinguish that and measure the rates with this NMR spectrum, this two dimensional and Mr Spectrum, right? So again, we're seeing when when one frequency influences another. Now if a given set of protons moves from one position to another, then having been a radiating one influences what happens where it ended up, right?

Speaker 1:          23:44          Cause those protons are now here. So here you see off diagonal peaks where one has become another. So we can see here for example that see that, that the proton that was in position see becomes a, and that's what happened in the blue here when we had that one too rearrangement. We can also see that d becomes B and that you can see happened here and you can see that be becomes c but you notice there's not a becomes B a becomes d or c becomes d. So you don't have peaks for some of these patterns that you could have done. Now if you go, if you go through this whole sequence of these, then one can see you can start any place and any place else, right? But it takes a longer time. So depending on the time scale of this thing, you can tell which things happen quickly, right?

Speaker 1:          24:37          And what happens quickly is a one to shift, not a one anywhere shift. So again, that's information on mechanism that comes from two dimensional NMR spectroscopy and its proton versus Proton correlation in time. That's incidentally just another map of this same, another visualization that this same map I showed before that shows the peaks on the diagonals and the off diagonal peaks. Okay, now we've finished with Nmr. Okay? Earlier we all refer to it again, but, but we've finished discussing it. Uh, and we'll go onto the next important reaction, which has electrophilic aromatic substitution. We've talked about electrophilic things before. Remember electrophilic addition to an alkene. Now you might think benzene is an Alkane. So you get electrophilic addition to the double bonds and benzene, but you don't get addition, you get substitution, right? So here's an example of substituting deuterium for hydrogen. You've put benzene and concentrated sulfuric acid that has deuterium in it, and you get deuterium first in one position.

Speaker 1:          25:43          Then of course, in other positions in the, uh, in the, uh, benzene, uh, so you can go all the way to c six d six. That's how you've prepared deuterated benzene. If you want to use it for a solvent, for something, for example, okay, now, uh, you can use other electro files as well, not just deep plus. You can use an Otu plus br plus the sulfur plus r plus, and our CEO, plus all these things can substitute for hydrogen. And we're going to talk about those. Okay? Now the mechanism is that the Deuterium d plus the Deuteron adds to the ring, but that notice changes the aromatic ring into just a regular pen to diagonal system. So you lose a lot of resonance stabilization. It happens, but it's not, not very stable. And it will easily come off again, if there's anything that can take a proton.

Speaker 1:          26:39          But if you have a very, very non nuclear fillic non-basic solvent, nothing to take it off, then it can stay on. And in fact, you can get, uh, it's observable. You can get specter of it. And uh, so in electrophilic addition to Alkenes, the next thing that happens is a nucleophile would add, right? And you'd lose the double bond. But here it's easier to lose the Deuteron or more. Interestingly, the Proton, losing the Deuteron would take you back to the starting material, but losing a proton, the h then takes you to the substituted product. And that's easier than that. Adding a nucleophile because, because you get back to the aromatic stabilization 30 kilocalories. And remember we just saw spectrum that looked like that, right? This is the, when you added, not age, but c h three plus to the, uh, to the benzene, to the, in this case, the heck's a methyl benzene.

Speaker 1:          27:33          So it's possible to see these things in Nmr. Okay? So there's the benzene, the d plus comes on. We get that, uh, it noticed that it converts the ring, the aromatic ring into a chain destroying the hermiticity. Let's look at the, uh, at the orbitals that are involved just using this simple local program. So the benzene, we've looked at this, the orbitals of that on the left and Penta, Diane, or we looked at before too, and we see it on the right now, the most interesting orbital and Penta diagonal is that the one that's indicated in yellow over there, right? The highest, uh, the, the highest of the three orbital, the low three orbitals, and it's a zero. And you know, it's a zero, the same energy as a p orbital. How do you know the energy of that molecular orbital consisting of three p orbitals is the same energy as a normal p orbital.

Speaker 1:          28:29          No, but remember if you make a double bond to put the two next to one another, they overlap. You get one goes down, one goes up. It's not the same energy, but this one has the same energy as an isolated p orbital. How do you know that? Notice how many nodes are there in the lowest one. The one that's about minus two. How many nodes among the, for the Pi orbitals. One, two, one, two, three, four, five p orbitals connected in a chain. What's how many nodes in the lowest combination? Zero. Zero. Except for the node of the P. Orbitals of course. So zero. Then the next one, the one that's at about minus one or one. How about the RS? Two. Three. Two. Okay. And so there are two nodes, red, white, red on the top. Okay. Now how do we know the energy of that?

Speaker 1:          29:15          How much overlap is there? None. They're not next to one another. So it's the same as an isolated p orbital [inaudible]. At the huckle approximation. Okay. So that, that one is very interesting. That's so mo, it's uh, it's non bonding in the case where we have a single electron in there, which is what's shown. Okay. So that's, that's the locus of that odd electron in the free radical, right? If we have five Pi electrons, the fifth, the one that's not in a pair is in those three positions. Now suppose we're interested in the cad ion with five p orbitals in a row. Okay. So we're, we're gonna do is take that electron out and where we take it out is now going to be a positive charge. So that's the same as the locus, or pardon me if we put another electron in and the anti, and that would be the locus of the negative charge and in the cat eye and the locust of the positive charge.

Speaker 1:          30:08          And that's the same thing we did get by drawing resonance structures that show the, those same positions have in charges or free radicals in them. Okay. So those are the positions of positive charge and we get the same thing. Drawing residents pictures right now. Consider the influence on rate of Eh, of substituting, not benzene, but something that all of benzine that already has some x group on it. Okay. Now what a very common thing to have studied with this was nitration because it's such an easy reaction to do. It's very vigorous reagent and o two plus it, you make it by just having a mixture of nitric and sulfuric acid. Do you see how you get an Otu plus from that mixture? It's quite simple. You get a proton from sulfuric acid and it protests protonate the Ooh, and then you lose water. So you've got to know two plus.

Speaker 1:          31:03          So it can be the thing that comes in and then a proton comes off from the same position and you've got the substitution. But now when you have x in there, you can get three different isomers, Ortho, Meta and para, they're called. Okay. Notice incidentally that in o two pluses, an interesting molecule because it's exactly the same as CEO to, except it has one more proton in the nucleus of the central atom. Right? Nitrogen instead of carbon. Okay? Uh, so there will be, so CO2 has, has a pair of electrons in that double bond, a pair of electrons on the oxygen that are in the y or bubbles pointing up and down. It's also got p orbitals is x orbitals coming in and out, right? That have the same kind of thing. But if we consider just the why or bundles, right? That'll be the Lumo there.

Speaker 1:          31:55          There are two pairs of electrons. So the one with no nodes has two electrons. The one with one node has two electrons. This is the one with two nodes, no electrons. Okay, so that's, that's the vacant oral would allow Lumo of an Otu plus just like CO2. Okay, so I o two plus attacks and you, we can measure the rate. Now what we're going to do to measure the rate, we could do careful work with a stopwatch and so on, but there's a clever way to do it, which is to compare to follicular by doing them both. Put both in there and do the reaction for just a little while and then kill it, right? If you had base, you won't have the strong acid and the reactional stop and now see how much of each one is con is it becomes product, so we get relative rates that way, so we're going relative rates compared to hydrogen being one that has benzene when excess hydrogen, okay.

Speaker 1:          32:51          Effects is methyl, it's 25 times faster. That is if you have 25 times as much benzene as tall youin the one with methyl on it, you'll get equal amounts of the products at first until you've used up all the tall Youin, so it's 25 times faster, so methyl helps the reaction, Oh, h really helps it. If you use funnel, it's a thousand times faster if getting the sum of all the products right now, why are those so fast? Because electron donation eases the formation of the carbon cad I and intermediate or looked at a different way. The carbon cad ions are stable because there are other electrons that become stabilized when you get a cad. I in there, for example, the unshared pair on oxygen.

Speaker 4:          33:37          Ah, okay. Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:40          Now that's because we have positive charge. We have positive charges to those locations. When x is there, that helps out.

Speaker 4:          33:48          Okay.

Speaker 1:          33:48          Now if you put an o two as acts, so it's already there, then it's six times 10 to the minus eight, it's 10 to the minus seven, 10 million times slower. Okay, so you and the same if you have trimethyl ammonium with its positive charge, you don't want to make those cat ions if there's another cat eye in there or if there's an [inaudible] group there, right? So those are electron withdrawing and they retired. The formation of cad ion intermediate, the most interesting as many times is the halogen. The halogen is a, is is slower than than benzene, but not much slower. Only 30 times slower. Right? And that's because both things are happening with halogen. It's withdrawing electrons in the sigma bond, but it has an unshared pair that donates back so that, so that it mostly cancels.

Speaker 4:          34:43          Okay. Uh, now

Speaker 1:          34:46          why is n o two electron withdrawing when Oah is electron donating? Oh, is more electronegative than nitrogen. So you might think that that always should be more electron withdrawing. Uh, unshared pair on nitrogen is higher energy than the unshared pair on oxygen should be more electron donating. So this seems at first glance to be sort of nuts that that uh, that o h is a thousand times faster and then o two is 10 million times slower. But it's pretty easy to understand when you look at the orbitals that are involved. So in the case of oxygen, there's this unshared pair on the oxygen, which can overlap with the, with the p orbitals on the benzene ring, right? It turns out indeed that the, that the energy of the oxygen unshared payer is about the same as Pi, have a carbon carbon bond, right? So that the, so that the p the, the, the unshared pair on Austin has about that energy about minus one on the scale we're talking about here.

Speaker 1:          35:48          Okay. So that's, that's unusually high as Pi are unusually high. So they mixed with the, uh, so when you have a vacant orbital next door, right, those electrons get stabilized. Okay. So it's a high homo, good overlap with fennel and therefore, Ooh, can donate. It's a unshared pair. Okay, that's good. Now, how about an o two? Well, notice that an o two is Al Lilly. It's got three p orbitals on each oxygen and on the nitrogen. Uh, okay. So it's going to have a low occupied molecular orbital that gives good overlap with fennel, right? So that one was able to donate, uh, electronics because it has good overlap, but it's not willing to share. It's electrons. It's electrons are very low in energy, right? They're not going to be much stabilized by having a vacant orbital next door, so you're not gonna get anything out out of that from the low one.

Speaker 1:          36:44          The next orbital of the [inaudible] system has a node in the middle, right? That one. Now that one has the, the energy shown in yellow there, it's going to be very good, right? It's got a good high homo, as high as, as the p orbital on oxygen. So it should be good at donating electrons that having its electron stabilized by the vacant orbital in the benzene ring. But it's not. Why not? Can you see, why doesn't this orbital be stabilized by mixing with orbitals that are on the benzene ring? Because there's no overlap. It doesn't have any size where it's adjacent to the benzene ring. So it has no overlap. So it's willing to give its electrons, but it's not able because there's no overlap. And finally you have the the third of the aloe leaf orbitals that one though, which is a low Lumo right?

Speaker 1:          37:40          And it has good overlap with fennel. So it, it withdraws electrons. It's willing to take electrons cause it's unusually low and it has overlapped so it's able to accept electrons. So that's why nitro is electron withdrawing. When Oah is electron donating, it's because of that node in the middle that makes it unable to give electrons to the benzene ring. So in o two is that Pi acceptor, whereas Oah is a Pi donor. Okay. Now we just looked at the rates of these reactions are forming all three products together, but we might be interested in the individual products, Ortho, Meta, and para. So let's look at that. In the case of hydrogen will call each of these one. That's our, and now we'll do mixtures of hydrogen with others. But now we'll analyze those x, the ones that already have an exit them. We'll analyze whether it's Ortho mare that metta or para and how much of each one. Now, if its methyl, you see that two of them are very fast, but one of them is not fast compared to what it was when all the hydrogen this on the ring, how do you, how do you understand the two that are fast? Why are those fast when x is methyl?

Speaker 1:          38:59          Linda, do you have an idea when x up here is [inaudible] this is good and this is good. 39 and 46 but this one is not any better.

Speaker 2:          39:11          Okay?

Speaker 1:          39:12          Nothing wants to be where the cat eye on is. Okay, so it's good. Especially good here and especially good here, but not here. They're only hydrogens here, here and here and it has the same rate as hydrogen. Okay, that's fine. If you'd look at at t butyl now again, it's fast over here,

Speaker 2:          39:31          right?

Speaker 1:          39:32          But it's not fast here. So why don't you get this product? When you have the r group here, when it's t butyl, you get one, your methyl, but not when it's t beautiful. Nathan, you got an idea? It's steric hindrance. It's too big. It's hard to put this extra group here when you have something big there already. Okay, so that's good. Uh, so now there are two things about a substituent x. Does it make it go faster or does it make it go slower? Is it activating or deactivating? And so it's activated. These are faster than benzene. And how is it directing what, what does it direct? It's Ortho and para. Right? For the reason we saw accepted in the t butyl case, it's not very much Ortho because of steric hindrance as Nathan told us. Okay. So those are elect, those are electron donating and liked to be Ortho para.

Speaker 1:          40:27          Other things being equal. Now here's one that's the same size as that as that uh, neopentyl group that are the t butyl group, the carbon with three methyls on it. Right? But notice it's very much slower. Right? And we saw that before, but it's selectively slower. It slowed much more here. Point six times down to the minus eight than it is here. Three times 10 to the minus eight. So it's slow to get product, but when you get product, this is the one you get, right? Metta, you don't get Ortho and para, especially, you don't get Ortho because it's sterically hindered. Right? But you see that's the same thing if you want to, if you want to form these things, when x has a plus charge, don't put it here and don't put it here. If you're going to do it, put it there. Make it as far away as possible.

Speaker 1:          41:16          So if that's up, okay. And the same thing is true of nitro. It's slowed down everywhere, right? But it's not nearly as slowed down. Metta as it is here. It's a slow time. 10 Times more here for, for Ortho and a whatever. A 300 times, right? 1,000. Yeah, 300 times slower when it's para. Okay. And if you have an Ester group, uh, the same kind of thing is true here. It's 10 times slower here than here. Twice slower here than there. Okay. So those are deactivating for the reasons we talked about before and their Meta directing. But again, halogen especially interesting because it's, notice it's slowed down, right? It's deactivating, but it's Ortho para directing. So it shows both these characters deactivating and Ortho para. Why? It's deactivating because of the electron withdrawal, which is sigma. But if you're going to make it, at least make it where the halogens unshared pair can be stabilized by the V, the next by the vacant orbital next door. Uh, okay.

Speaker 1:          42:33          Now how can you make the reaction work better to electrophilic substitution? You can make the electro file better. So C plus would be a great, uh, uh, nucleophile but you don't, but you don't buy c plus you have cl two. So what would be the, what's the low Lumo here of in cl to pass this maybe 15 times before and lecture Sigma Star. Okay. It's, but it's not nearly as low as cl plus. One way to make it better is to treat it with the Lewis acid catalyst, like ALC l three, which has a vacant orbital on aluminum, which can attack and unshared pair on the chlorine like that. And now you have a minus formal charge on the aluminum and plus on the chlorine. It's a better leaving group, right? So now you can do it better. So cl two won't be nearly as reactive as ALC l five.

Speaker 1:          43:29          Okay. Here we can compare their lumos and see it's essentially the same Lumo but it's lower in the case of ALC l five. So we can do this reaction and it'll behave as if it were cl. Plus, if you look at the surface charge 0.29 positive their point or 29 there and 38, uh, on the one with ALC l three. So it's a better, it's a better electro file. So adding a Lewis acid makes these things work better. So the leaving group is then ALC l four minus rather than cl minus. And remember before when we said that the rate of addition to Alkenes of bromine is in some solvents is second order and bromine because that second bromine molecule makes the leaving group br three minus rather than br minus and makes the reaction better. Exactly the same idea here. Another way to make the reaction better is to activate the nucleophile.

Speaker 1:          44:28          So salycilic acid, which was studied by Colby, same guy who excoriate advant off about stereochemistry, uh, invented the way to make salycilic acid or uh, yeah. Uh, so you start with funnel, you reacted with CO2, which has that vacant orbital we talked about, right? Like the one and I know two plus. So you could imagine that reaction just like an o two plus except that co two. Is it nearly as low as an Otu plus with its extra proton? So you could, but you can make the nucleophile better. Right? In the previous slide we saw making the electrified better. Okay. So here we have the unshared para nitrogen oxygen, which helps this out. But we could make it ever so much better by putting base in and making it a higher unshared pair. And now you have a big push to do it and you get salycilic acid, which is the way it aspirin, where aspirin comes from, from putting CO2 on funnel.

Speaker 1:          45:28          Now you can imagine the same thing for Nh two. It's a higher, uh, unshared pair than the one on oxygen normally. Okay? So it would do this pushing too. And you could nitrate, uh, Anilin Amino benzene is called Anilin. And in fact, this was proposed and in fact used in 1944 as a rocket fuel, a mixture of nitric acid and analysts. And there's a little story I'm going to tell here about a good friend of mine, Dennis Tanner, who was a professor for many years at the University of Alberta, but when he was a postdoc who was at Stanford and he's a very hard worker and he was working in the lab on the 4th of July. Not many people were working on the 4th of July, but several people where they passed each other in the hall and they decided they should have some fun too. So they decided that each person would put on display out in the parking lot.

Speaker 1:          46:22          So what, uh, uh, uh, Dennis had heard about this being a self igniting rocket fuel's so he thought it'd be fun to mix to nitrate analysts to do the nitration of Andaman. So he got concentrated nitric acid and put it in a, in a beaker and he got anilin and put it in a separatory funnel and hung it above the beaker and he crouched down and grabbed the thing and twisted it and I started to run. But the instant it hit before he'd gotten more than two paces is enormous fireball that burned off his eyebrows. Right? So indeed, this is a very, very active nitration reaction. Okay. Has Dennis proved okay? But you can tame it. If you put an asset deal group on the Anilin, then you lower the energy of the unshared, pair the, the Pi Star of the carbon eel mixes with it. It lowers it.

Speaker 1:          47:13          Now you don't have so much of a push anymore, right? And now the nitration still takes place. It's still Ortho, para directing. Right? But it doesn't burden your eyebrows off. Okay. So the Acetylation of Andel and makes its nitration controllable. So you can start with Anilin, uh, react it with asset deal chloride and parody in which is often used as a catalyst for putting assets deal groups on. We'll talk about that later, right? And now you can do the nitration, right? And you get, you see it's Ortho para directing, not Meta directing. So the unshared pair is still doing its work, but not as dramatically as in Dennis's case. Right? But then if you really wanted to do the titration of animal and now you take the asset deal group back off again, right? So you have the product. So you tame the nitration. Now I just want to introduce the biographical part of this and we'll talk about the rest of it next time.

Speaker 1:          48:10          So the Friedel crafts reaction is one of the most important electrophilic substitution reactions. In fact, it's one of the most important reactions all together. And it was named after Charlotte Free Del and James Mason crafts free. Del was a Frenchman notice he's seven years older than crafts who was an American. So this is a great example of where America stood in international science in the last part of the 19th century. Okay. So these are the publications of James Mason crafts from 1862 when he was a student until 1915 when he, when he, when he died. So some of his papers were on organic chemistry and they didn't have free Dell as a coauthor. And there is at, at different ages there, he published a number as a student there as you'll see, but then kept publishing. Uh, now here's his, here's his trajectory. He was born in Boston. He studied at Harvard.

Speaker 1:          49:08          Okay. Uh, then, but then the learn real science, he went to Europe first. He went to Germany for just a short period. He worked with Bunsen exam actually. Then he went to France and worked with boards, the successor of Dumas. Okay. And he stayed there for four years, right. And then he came back. He actually inspected mines in Mexico for a year. Okay. But then California, then he went to Cornell, which had just been founded to be the chemistry professor for a couple of years. Then he went to MIT, right. And then he was ill, but also tired of not doing research and he went back to Paris. He went back for just two years, but he stayed for 17 years and now he was working with his Palfrey Dell, who we'd met at a student as a student in [inaudible] lab. Then he came back to MIT and in fact he was president of Mit for two years, around 1900 okay.

Speaker 1:          50:05          Now here are his papers that are not organic chemistry. There are about thermometry about physical chemistry and notice he did most of the publication during the second period in Paris when he was doing only research. But if you look at his papers with Free Dell, they're an enormous number of, during this period when he was in America, he published almost nothing. Right when he was in, he published a lot, both as a student when he started working with Friedl and especially after he came back in these 17 years. So he published 100 papers during these years, 99 papers during those years. So it wasn't possible to do the kind of research in this country that you could do over there. Okay. And then in 1877, they've published a, when you just, after he had gone back to, uh, to, uh, recover and, and, uh, work with his Palfrey Dell at the School of mines, they published a really important paper and most of those read publications after that are about this free del crafts reaction. And they got into it because they had been students together working with boards and we'll talk about this then next time.
