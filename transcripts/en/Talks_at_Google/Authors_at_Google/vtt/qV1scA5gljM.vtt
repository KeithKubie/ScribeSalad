00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:06.420
SPEAKER 1: Welcome.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.850
ANDY GALPIN: Thank you.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.974
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:00:07.974 --> 00:00:08.800
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.470
So Dr. Galpin, that's quite
the resume you have there.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.120
So tell us a bit more about
your work at CSU Fullerton.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:17.920
ANDY GALPIN: So my primary
job is really threefold.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.950
Number one, I teach classes
in nutrition, performance,

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.490
strength conditioning.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:24.120
We have, of course,
our laboratories.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.619
In the Center for
Sport Performance,

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.600
we've got about seven different
laboratories, biomechanics,

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.730
exercise physiology, sports
psychology, human performance,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.950
and motor control,
motor learning.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.620
So really our job is to
produce research that

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.280
improves the human condition.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.250
We tend to focus on performance
and sport performance.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.132
But really, as the talk
probably evolves here,

00:00:46.132 --> 00:00:47.590
you'll probably
start to understand

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.444
how I think that is a
little bit more wide ranging

00:00:50.444 --> 00:00:51.610
than some people understand.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.360
So if you improve
sport performance,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.480
it's also a very good
microcosm for understanding

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.120
what improves that
general human condition.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.090
So with that being said, the
third tier, really, of my job

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.599
is to disseminate
that information

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:04.599
that we're learning in a
lot of our laboratories

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.210
and our studies to the
people that use it,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.165
whether that be the professional
athletes or the USC Fighters,

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:12.680
or whether that be
you folks at home.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.250
That's also why I do the
podcast and why I'm here today

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.260
and why I wrote the book.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.451
And if you noticed
the tone the book,

00:01:19.451 --> 00:01:20.950
it's written for
the general public.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.804
It's not written like I
write my scientific papers.

00:01:23.804 --> 00:01:25.720
And that's because we're
trying to take things

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.120
we learn in our
laboratory and put it

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.280
into practice with the
people that are going

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.829
to use it and benefit from it.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:32.620
SPEAKER 1: Got. it.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.360
And so how did you
go from leading

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.620
a lab to working with Olympians
and professional MMA fighters?

00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:42.040
ANDY GALPIN: Well, that's
really the same thing for me.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.687
They tend to be the participants
and the subjects in my studies

00:01:44.687 --> 00:01:46.270
because I'm trying
to learn how muscle

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.590
functions at the high level.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.520
Specifically, what
we do in our lab

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.570
is we learn what regulates how
muscle grows, shrinks, dies,

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.160
and repairs.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.410
And it's important to
understand that from the disease

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.929
prevention treatment model.

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.470
But it's also
important to understand

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.790
the other side of
the equation, which

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.010
is let's look at the athletes
who are the best in the world,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.470
because now we understand
what we're trying to get to.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.900
And so there's a very natural
crossover between these

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.760
are the people I'm
trying to study.

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.260
I'm learning
information about them.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.210
Well, then let's take
the information I know

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.418
and give it back to them
and see if we could actually

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:16.450
change performance.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.640
And so it's really circular.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.650
It works really well that way.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.630
I get something out of it.

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:20.838
They get something out of it.

00:02:20.838 --> 00:02:22.261
So it is a natural blend.

00:02:22.261 --> 00:02:24.760
SPEAKER 1: So let's first assume
that I'm a professional MMA

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.551
fighter, which is highly
unlikely because I

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:29.470
have terrible vision, tore my
meniscus, and no neck tattoos.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.170
ANDY GALPIN: And
you work at Google.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.550
SPEAKER 1: And I work at Google.

00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:31.570
ANDY GALPIN: So probably not.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.830
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:32.620
Yeah, probably not.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.300
Yeah, it's probably not
a future career move.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.758
But let's for a
second assume that.

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:36.780
So would you work--

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.140
would I only work with you?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.804
Or would you be part
of a crew, of a team?

00:02:40.804 --> 00:02:42.220
ANDY GALPIN: My
role, whenever I'm

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.350
working with an athlete
or my mom or anybody else

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.910
is to do whatever I need to
do to improve that person

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:52.550
or to get them.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.220
And if that means you need to
work with me directly and only

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.140
me, that's fine.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.962
If you need me to be the
43rd person on your team,

00:02:58.962 --> 00:02:59.920
that's absolutely fine.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.084
My goal is not to have
anyone ever do my system.

00:03:03.084 --> 00:03:04.000
I don't have a system.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.545
My goal is to figure out what
your problem is and fix it.

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:09.086
The easy example
here-- and I'm going

00:03:09.086 --> 00:03:11.980
to show you how bad I
understand programming.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.780
But this works very easy.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.970
If you had a problem
with some software that

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.830
wasn't working
properly, you can't just

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:20.950
send the same piece of
code to fix everything.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.410
It's easier to just look
at the current code,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.450
fix the one problem,
and then go back.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.660
That's all I'm trying to do.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.750
And we have a major
fallacy of assuming

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.950
everyone has the same problem.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.800
So the answer to
your question is

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.240
I'm trying to find
whatever role I

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.090
can to help the person
through their problem

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.384
or to improve them if
they don't have a problem.

00:03:39.384 --> 00:03:41.300
And so I've played every
role you can imagine.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.730
Some of the athletes
I work with,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.620
I'm pretty high at the top.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.460
And I'm determining
what's going on.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:49.330
Some of them, it's
very low-level stuff.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.400
I'm always trying to
encourage interaction

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.430
with all their coaches,
their physicians, their staff

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.230
members, their
agents, whatever I

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.649
can to help them fix
the problem or improve

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:00.940
what they're trying to improve.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.020
That's my circular goal.

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.352
It's about them not me.

00:04:04.352 --> 00:04:05.060
SPEAKER 1: Mm-hm.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.194
Yeah, and I suppose having
that approach makes it

00:04:07.194 --> 00:04:09.610
so that working with so many
smart folks, like they're not

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.735
stepping on one another's
toes because you're there

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:13.390
for the individual
not for yourself.

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.269
ANDY GALPIN: That's probably my
single biggest piece of advice

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.762
when working with an athlete.

00:04:17.762 --> 00:04:18.970
They have to understand that.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.010
Because they will see
right through that as well.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.301
A lot of people want to work
with professional athletes

00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:25.119
or any high-level
functioning person.

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:27.160
It doesn't matter if it's
a professional athlete.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.540
They want to work
with that person

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.511
so that they can level up.

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:33.260
I want this person to
succeed so that they

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.080
can go around and tell
the media that I got

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.759
better because of Andy, right?

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:39.550
And an athlete will
see right through that.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.091
And so you have to actually have
that altruistic nature where

00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.830
you're saying, I'm just trying
to help this person because I

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.730
want to help that person.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.730
If you do it because you
want to level up or get

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:51.070
fame or fortune from it,
it's not going to work.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.160
So my approach is that way
because I'm really genuinely

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.830
trying to help them.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.580
Most of the athletes
that I've worked with

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.260
have never mentioned me
on their Twitter feed.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.510
They've never posted about me.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.130
And that's fine.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.088
That's not why I do it.

00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:04.010
Occasionally, if they
do it, that's great.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:06.620
But the point is to
help them get better.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.740
And in a job like mine, working
directly with the athletes

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.900
is not actually part of my job.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.332
I have laboratories to run.

00:05:13.332 --> 00:05:14.790
You heard all the
things I'm doing.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:15.873
I've got classes to teach.

00:05:15.873 --> 00:05:17.360
I've got other service to do.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.200
I'm on national boards and
scientific advisory panels

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.680
and things like that.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.380
So when I work with them, that's
a hobby for the most part.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:29.954
It goes in that category in my
brain in terms of my workflow.

00:05:29.954 --> 00:05:31.370
And so I treat it
like that, which

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.900
means I'm going to do this
from the altruistic perspective

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.730
of it gives me enjoyment or joy.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:39.087
I enjoy it.

00:05:39.087 --> 00:05:40.170
And I like to help people.

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:42.378
So if I think I can offer
somebody some help, I will.

00:05:42.378 --> 00:05:44.990
But I'm not doing it for me,
because I got names everywhere.

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.500
I got books.

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.080
I got titles.

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.850
I got awards.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.462
It's the last thing I need.

00:05:48.462 --> 00:05:50.045
It's the last thing
I'm interested in.

00:05:50.045 --> 00:05:50.300
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.710
Something that really
stood out about your work,

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.710
and I mentioned this to
you before we walked in,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.060
was that it's both really
refreshing, but also really

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.840
frustrating.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:58.469
Because I'm like, am I keto?

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.510
Do I do know how to keto?

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.380
Like, which diet
is the best for me?

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.880
And I think that
there's this idea that

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.340
it's a one-size-fits-all
mentality for both fitness

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.390
and nutrition.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:09.590
And I was wondering if you
could speak a little bit

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:11.798
on the nuance and kind of
the way you would approach,

00:06:11.798 --> 00:06:16.121
let's say, forming a diet for
a high-performing Olympian?

00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:18.620
ANDY GALPIN: I think the best
way I can set this whole story

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.200
up is a few years ago,
my students walked

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.175
into my classroom on the last
day before the final and told

00:06:24.175 --> 00:06:26.050
me that they weren't
going to take the final,

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.160
that they just hadn't--

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.910
they pulled out from their
bag a big bag of diapers.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:33.160
And they said, this is our
answer for every question

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:36.580
because the answer is
always, it just depends.

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:38.740
Right?

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.580
There's a time delay
in the joke there.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.080
I know.

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.270
Give it a second.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.770
But that's what you're referring
to in terms of frustrating,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.750
because that is
always the answer.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.670
Physiology is so complex.

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:51.370
And the reason-- even if
you had 2 or 200 people that

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.880
had the same, quote
unquote, "problem,"

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.739
it may not have the same
reason why the problem's there.

00:06:56.739 --> 00:06:58.530
And so if you give them
the same treatment,

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.184
it may or may not be effective.

00:07:00.184 --> 00:07:02.100
And so I never give
people blanket statements.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.890
I will use any
tool to fix a job.

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.920
And oftentimes you
have innumerable tools

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:08.960
that could fix it.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.564
And you have to go to your next
level of thinking and logic

00:07:11.564 --> 00:07:13.980
to figure out which one do I
choose, because 1,000 of them

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.480
could.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.681
I mean, an example up here, I've
got two different water bottles

00:07:17.681 --> 00:07:18.180
up here.

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:19.390
They're not identical.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:22.230
And if my problem was
hydration, there's pros and cons

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.056
to both approaches here.

00:07:24.056 --> 00:07:25.930
And so I'm not trying
to just say, all right,

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.596
everyone drink this
because it's better.

00:07:27.596 --> 00:07:29.980
Everyone drink this, don't
drink this because it's worse.

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.900
I want to look through every
piece of evidence, what

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.233
all possible could be going
on here, what all's possible

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:36.130
going on here, and
understand the pros

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.820
and cons of implementing
that in for my solution.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.210
And that's always what's
going through my brain.

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:43.340
We'll get to this,
I'm sure, in a second,

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.180
but there's no free
passes in physiology.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:47.830
Everything does something.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.530
And so you have to consider
both the potential help

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.500
and the potential consequence
of anything you implement,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.510
whether that's food
or that's supplement,

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.490
whether it's a sleep
thing, it's technology.

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.930
Of course, this is
what the book is about.

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.513
There are pros and
cons to everything.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:01.707
Everything has an effect.

00:08:01.707 --> 00:08:03.790
And now when you start
putting that into a system,

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:05.960
like physiology,
that is so complex,

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.140
you have to understand
when you turn a switch,

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.757
it doesn't go on and off.

00:08:09.757 --> 00:08:11.840
It does a bunch of different
things in physiology.

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.547
So the game board is
constantly moving.

00:08:13.547 --> 00:08:15.880
When you adjust one piece,
it doesn't just do one thing.

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:17.935
It adjusts 1,000 other
things millions, millions

00:08:17.935 --> 00:08:19.160
of other things really.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.200
And so you have to
factor all that stuff in.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.710
And at the end of the
day, you're guessing.

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:28.100
And anyone that says anything
different in mechanical biology

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:32.730
or perhaps the software
stuff, math is very clear.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.230
You do this.

00:08:33.230 --> 00:08:34.190
It turns into that.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.340
Physiology does
not work like that.

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.309
It is way too complex.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:38.870
It's biology.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:40.460
It's too moving, right?

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:45.470
The understanding or clarity of
truth in biological or medicine

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.400
is really, really
difficult to get to.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.094
And so you have to
have that humility when

00:08:50.094 --> 00:08:52.010
you treat people, when
you work with athletes,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.590
understanding I think this is
how it's going to work based

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:57.260
on my experience and the
evidence and everything else

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.370
I've been through.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.290
But at the end of the
day, you don't know.

00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:01.765
You're just guessing.

00:09:01.765 --> 00:09:04.140
SPEAKER 1: So what would be
an example of that trade off?

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.056
Like, let's say the
example I've heard you use

00:09:06.056 --> 00:09:08.550
before is like vitamin C. Yeah.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:11.220
So can you show a little
bit about the counterbalance

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.130
of taking in vitamin
C as a supplement?

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.899
ANDY GALPIN: Well, I mean,
I'll make an easier one.

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:18.440
Vitamins and minerals
are the easy go

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.367
to because if you just take
vitamin C prophylactically,

00:09:22.367 --> 00:09:23.950
so you just took it
all day every day,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.158
there's consequences to that.

00:09:25.158 --> 00:09:26.330
It has extreme toxicity.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:29.750
The idea here is
called hormesis,

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:32.540
which means there's a
toxicity curve to everything.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:35.990
And water, I'll go here because
it's an even easier example

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.579
which sets the point better.

00:09:37.579 --> 00:09:39.620
How many of you would be
willing to stop drinking

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.786
water the rest of your life?

00:09:43.172 --> 00:09:44.880
Right, not too many
hands going up there.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.740
So you would all agree
being very low in hydration

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:50.660
is a problem, right?

00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:52.100
And you've heard
this 1,000 times.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:52.808
Drink more water.

00:09:52.808 --> 00:09:54.290
It's better for you, right?

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:56.990
Do you all realize that
if you drink enough water,

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:59.190
that will kill you?

00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.680
You all know this, right?

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.440
There is the toxicity
curve with water.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:07.140
The most inert thing on the
planet has a toxicity curve.

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:11.560
If you drink too much of it, you
get what's called hyponatremia.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.692
The sodium, potassium
pumps the things--

00:10:14.692 --> 00:10:16.650
the reasons why you have
an electrical gradient

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:19.610
between the muscles that cause
contraction becomes diluted.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.280
Nothing pumps.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.600
The heart stops pumping, right?

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.010
There's is a toxicity
curve to water.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.550
I'll use an easier one.

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:32.920
How many of you are willing to
go 15 minutes without oxygen?

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.950
ANDY GALPIN: Do you also
realize oxygen is probably

00:10:37.950 --> 00:10:39.467
the most toxic
thing on the planet?

00:10:39.467 --> 00:10:40.550
Like, this is rust, right?

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:41.670
This is oxidized.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.150
This is the problem here.

00:10:43.150 --> 00:10:44.610
So vitamin C is no different.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:45.990
Pick your mineral.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.000
Iron is a big one in men.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.254
Sometimes men have
too much iron.

00:10:50.254 --> 00:10:51.420
Women have the same problem.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.432
If you just give people
prophylactic iron, especially

00:10:54.432 --> 00:10:55.890
women-- this is a
common one we see

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.480
because of the menstrual cycle.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.220
We'll just give women more iron.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.550
Well, fantastic that causes all
kinds of oxidative problems.

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.956
It causes all kinds
of damage to DNA.

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.330
There's a ton of
issues with that

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.190
if you're giving them too much.

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:10.830
So you can't just
give people things.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.205
This is what I
said a minute ago.

00:11:12.205 --> 00:11:14.520
There are no free
passes in physiology.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.200
Nothing is good.

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:16.030
Nothing is bad.

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:19.680
Look, you have to stop
thinking about molecules

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.279
and personifying them.

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:23.570
Like, there's no little evil
body in the water molecule

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.156
who's like, yes, let
me get the human.

00:11:26.156 --> 00:11:27.030
I will get it, right?

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:28.780
Or, oh, I just want
to help people, right?

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.104
That [INAUDIBLE] movie "Inside
Out," or whatever it was?

00:11:32.104 --> 00:11:33.270
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, about the--

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:34.880
ANDY GALPIN: The
molecules are not people.

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.300
A piece of water
doesn't give a--

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.910
I almost said a
different word word--

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:42.670
doesn't care if you're happy
or sad or anything like that.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:45.175
Vitamin C is not toxic for you.

00:11:45.175 --> 00:11:47.300
You pick the worst, most
toxic thing on the planet.

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:48.105
It doesn't have a personality.

00:11:48.105 --> 00:11:48.914
It doesn't care.

00:11:48.914 --> 00:11:49.830
SPEAKER 1: Even sugar?

00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:51.120
ANDY GALPIN: Yes, sugar.

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.607
Like, sugar doesn't hate you.

00:11:52.607 --> 00:11:54.690
None of these things--
it's always about hormesis,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.860
where is it on the curve.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.620
And the crazy thing is
pick any of these vitamins,

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.170
minerals, or any
pharmacologically developed

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.220
item.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.970
At some point, it
can save your life.

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.910
It could be that the thing
that changes how you feel.

00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:14.180
It could also be the thing
that kills you or makes

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:14.917
you feel worse.

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:16.250
If you go further, it kills you.

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.302
So this is what I mean
with all those things.

00:12:18.302 --> 00:12:20.510
You have to understand where
you're at on that curve.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.000
And a large part of it is
you can get blood work done.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.060
But that's a very crude measure.

00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:28.100
Really, it's about
understanding how you feel,

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.855
because your body
will tell you things.

00:12:29.855 --> 00:12:33.440
And it turns out
nature's figured

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.460
out a lot of this hormetic
curve pretty well.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:38.960
The amount of
minerals, for example,

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:42.310
vitamin C, that you
can get through nature

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.360
are generally fine.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.230
Hardly any of you are likely
to be past the hormetic curve

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.110
where you're going to have
physiological problems

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.942
by consuming too many oranges.

00:12:51.942 --> 00:12:53.650
You're not going to
get that much vitamin

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.275
C because there's not that much
vitamin C in the orange, right?

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.600
It has a dosage that
says this is probably

00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.745
going to be appropriate.

00:12:59.745 --> 00:13:01.120
Where you can get
into a problem,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.360
though, is taking
things at dosages

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.750
that are way higher
than normal in nature,

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.140
so super concentrated exogenous
things like a pill, right?

00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:13.345
Now, you can get grams
of vitamin C at a time.

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:15.220
This is something you
would have never gotten

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:16.090
in the natural world.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.964
And you have to be
careful here of not making

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:20.655
the natural fallacy, which
is that just because things

00:13:20.655 --> 00:13:22.530
are this way in nature,
that means it's good.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.250
That's not true.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.560
But it is fairly
reasonable in this context

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.690
to say that the sugar
would be the same thing.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.640
We could certainly
dive into that.

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.681
It's not the fact that there's
too much sugar in a carrot,

00:13:34.681 --> 00:13:35.180
right?

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.690
It's the fact that the way that
people often consume sugar now,

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:40.442
it's in extremely
concentrated forms that

00:13:40.442 --> 00:13:41.900
would have not--
you would have had

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.670
to eat four bundles
of carrots to get

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.640
that much sugar or a beet,
for that matter, too.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.640
So that's really the issue
with all those things

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.480
is we're not
consuming those things

00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.180
or we are consuming those things
in concentrations or dosages

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.727
that our physiology is
not really prepared for.

00:13:55.727 --> 00:13:58.310
SPEAKER 1: So then to bring it
back it back to the local level

00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:59.893
then, how can we
take that information

00:13:59.893 --> 00:14:03.530
and apply to it to our
day to day here at Google?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:04.860
Is there like a best practice?

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.021
Do you just, like, adjust your
eating based on the activity

00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:08.520
that you do?

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.520
ANDY GALPIN: Turns out
there is a best practice,

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.120
and it's all laid
out right here.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.460
SPEAKER 1: Nice.

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:14.610
ANDY GALPIN: Just kidding.

00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:15.235
I'm not really.

00:14:15.235 --> 00:14:17.950
But that's really what
I'm talking about.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:25.430
The best practice, number one,
is to treat the problem, not

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:27.560
the symptom.

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.500
That's the issue.

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.690
So, for example, we'll just
keep writing about vitamin C

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:32.840
since you brought it up.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:35.930
Why do people generally take
vitamin C prophylactically?

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.060
SPEAKER 1: They feel sick
or about to get sick.

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.329
ANDY GALPIN: Perfect, right?

00:14:39.329 --> 00:14:41.870
If you're taking that all the
time because every two or three

00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:43.494
weeks you feel like
you're getting sick

00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:46.239
or you are getting sick, that
will cover up the symptom.

00:14:46.239 --> 00:14:47.030
It may even fix it.

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:49.220
But what's the problem?

00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:53.090
Something in your lifestyle
or diet or nutrition or sleep

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.290
is wrong.

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.430
That's why you
keep getting sick.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.875
So you need to fix that problem.

00:14:57.875 --> 00:14:59.750
Now, you can take the
vitamin C once or twice

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.964
or something when
you've got a crazy month

00:15:01.964 --> 00:15:03.380
and you've got to
get this project

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.790
or you're over--
all right, fine.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:09.320
But you have to realize that is
the symptom that your body is

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.630
trying to tell you're
doing something wrong.

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:16.331
So at some point, you have got
to go back and fix the problem,

00:15:16.331 --> 00:15:16.830
right?

00:15:16.830 --> 00:15:19.270
And that could be a
whole bunch of things.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.180
It's terribly boring.

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.790
But I generally will apply the
same problem or the solution

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.740
for that problem to everyone.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.074
You're probably not sleeping
well and consistently.

00:15:28.074 --> 00:15:30.240
You're probably not eating
enough high-quality food.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.310
You're probably eating too
much low-quality things.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.690
And you're probably not getting
enough physical exercise.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:36.470
Like, most boring
talk ever, right?

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.265
It turns out it's
really, really true.

00:15:38.265 --> 00:15:39.390
That's why we say it right.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.732
Cliches are there for a reason.

00:15:40.732 --> 00:15:42.190
Stereotypes are
there for a reason.

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.295
They're generally pretty
true most the time.

00:15:44.295 --> 00:15:46.920
SPEAKER 1: Like, at the general
level, they're pretty accurate.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:48.900
ANDY GALPIN: At the general--
very general level, right?

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.990
But that's what they're
there for, though.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.210
We're trying to generalize.

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:53.347
We're trying to give big
sweeping recommendations

00:15:53.347 --> 00:15:53.930
for everybody.

00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.710
And turns out those are the
sweeping recommendations

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:56.970
that work really well.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.390
So we'll get to this
concept right now, I guess.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.930
I think the easiest way I can
explain this is on two ends

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:04.516
here.

00:16:04.516 --> 00:16:07.140
Over here you have optimization,
and this is something actually

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:10.630
very applicable to all of you.

00:16:10.630 --> 00:16:12.484
And over here is adaptation.

00:16:12.484 --> 00:16:14.900
So one of the things you have
to realize about physiology,

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.830
when you're optimizing,
you're not adapting.

00:16:19.830 --> 00:16:21.930
Or you can think of it
as you're super adapting.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:26.550
So if you're walking around
at all times optimizing,

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:28.020
you're actually
causing the system

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.590
to be more reliant
upon that optimization.

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:32.880
I'll give you an example.

00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.000
The easy one I can pick
on here is caffeine.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.090
So how many of you out
there are willing to work--

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:40.298
we're in a trust circle here.

00:16:40.298 --> 00:16:40.990
Don't worry.

00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:43.550
I'm only judging everything
you're doing right now.

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.110
How many of you are willing
to acknowledge that you're

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.610
a daily consumer of caffeine?

00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:50.830
SPEAKER 1: I like to party.

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.150
ANDY GALPIN: I like to party.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.920
Virtually every
hand goes up, right?

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:59.120
How many of you think your
day is significantly enhanced

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.340
or improved by that caffeine?

00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:04.910
How many of you-- we'll keep
going one step further--

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.940
are actually willing to admit
that if you were to not get

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:11.900
that caffeine dose in the
morning, your productivity

00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.849
or some other function
you see as positive

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:16.740
would be compromised?

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:17.866
Right.

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:19.490
So what happens with
caffeine over time

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:23.900
to your ability-- or its
effectiveness over time?

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:24.960
SPEAKER 1: Diminishes?

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.690
ANDY GALPIN: So you're
optimizing by taking that--

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:27.619
and I'm not against caffeine.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:29.600
I'm going to go against
this entirely in a second.

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.766
I just picked this one
because it's a very easy one.

00:17:31.766 --> 00:17:33.930
I knew all of your hands
would go up, right?

00:17:33.930 --> 00:17:34.770
Like, I get it.

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.740
I'm a full time scientist,
I run laboratories I

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:38.690
teach four classes a semester.

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.284
I write books.

00:17:39.284 --> 00:17:40.200
I do things like this.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.750
I don't have any
time either, right?

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.190
I work with athletes.

00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:44.920
We're all in that
same time crunch.

00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:48.710
I truly believe most people
work about equally hard, right?

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.830
None of us have any free time.

00:17:50.830 --> 00:17:52.690
So you're constantly optimizing.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:55.150
You're doing what makes
you feel the best right now

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:56.900
because you've got to
get this thing done.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.509
But then what happens is
another project comes up.

00:17:59.509 --> 00:18:00.800
And then another project comes.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.500
And you end up in
this constantly

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.210
optimizing everything, right?

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:05.860
I'm taking my nootropic.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.655
I'm taking my other
vitamin C pill

00:18:09.655 --> 00:18:10.780
so I don't get sick, right?

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.130
I won't fix the lifestyle stuff.

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:13.779
I'll optimize
everything right now.

00:18:13.779 --> 00:18:16.320
I'll take all the caffeine I
can to get through this project,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:16.780
right?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.405
But then I need more
and more and more.

00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:20.765
And then eventually
what happens, boom,

00:18:20.765 --> 00:18:22.060
you blow to pieces, right?

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.270
Physiology shuts down
because it became so reliant

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.357
on the technology,
what happens if you

00:18:28.357 --> 00:18:29.440
stop taking that caffeine?

00:18:32.010 --> 00:18:34.610
Headache, withdrawal
symptoms, right?

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.710
All these problems happen.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.670
And you're like, oh, my gosh, I
can't stop taking the caffeine

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.507
because you chose optimization.

00:18:42.507 --> 00:18:44.340
SPEAKER 1: Is that the
same thing with diet?

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.790
Like, if I were to be
100% keto and then I

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.784
couldn't get that type of food
and switch to something else,

00:18:50.784 --> 00:18:52.200
would there be a
similar reaction?

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:53.040
ANDY GALPIN: Similar idea.

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.690
But, yeah, you've
become what we would

00:18:54.690 --> 00:18:57.387
say is non-resilient, right?

00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:59.220
You don't want to put
yourself in a position

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.469
where you can't handle things.

00:19:00.469 --> 00:19:01.784
You want to have some grit.

00:19:01.784 --> 00:19:04.200
So I actually think it's great
when people say, hey, look,

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.110
I know if I do these four or
five things in the morning,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:09.731
I become extremely
clear and productive.

00:19:09.731 --> 00:19:10.230
That's good.

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.980
I want you all to
know those things.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:16.216
I just don't want you to
choose those every single time.

00:19:16.216 --> 00:19:17.590
So in the book,
we talk about you

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:21.280
have to engineer and
manufacture suffering sometimes.

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.670
You have to choose the
hard path sometimes.

00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.860
And you do that so
that this doesn't get

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.660
slid too far to the right.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.904
Because you end up
optimizing so much,

00:19:30.904 --> 00:19:32.320
that optimal doesn't
work anymore.

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:34.780
You've got to optimize more
and again optimize more.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.488
And now we're no longer
having an effect.

00:19:36.488 --> 00:19:39.640
And what do you think has
happened to the physiology?

00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:43.319
If you have to have caffeine
to wake up in the morning, what

00:19:43.319 --> 00:19:45.610
do you think happens to those
endogenous processes that

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:49.370
are there to help you wake up?

00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.212
SPEAKER 1: They become dull?

00:19:51.212 --> 00:19:52.920
ANDY GALPIN: De-sensitized,
they go away.

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.870
And eventually, years
later, months later,

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.390
weeks later, whatever happens
to me, this becomes a problem.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.220
And so the answer
to your question,

00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.740
what's the actionable step,
what can we do here at Google,

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.740
is, yes, sometimes
have caffeine or have

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.290
whatever you're looking for.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.920
And, again, caffeine's
just the one to pick on.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.960
But then sometimes
say, you know what?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.450
I'm going to perform today.

00:20:13.450 --> 00:20:14.530
I'm going to execute.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.280
I'm going to be focused
today without that stuff.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:22.172
Help the body learn to go
back the other direction too

00:20:22.172 --> 00:20:23.380
so that it learns to do that.

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:25.890
So you don't have to
have those things.

00:20:25.890 --> 00:20:28.990
You don't have to have 250
grams of fat a day just

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.460
to not feel foggy headed.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.290
If that's a problem,
you should learn

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.449
to build in what's called
metabolic flexibility.

00:20:36.449 --> 00:20:38.240
So I'll grant you, some
people are probably

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.174
very dominant on
carbohydrate, overly dominant.

00:20:42.174 --> 00:20:44.090
But that doesn't mean
you should become overly

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.507
dominant fat burning either.

00:20:45.507 --> 00:20:48.090
That's just the same thing, but
the other end in the spectrum.

00:20:48.090 --> 00:20:50.847
I want people to be able to
do both, go back and forth.

00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:53.180
So if you're in a situation
where a lot of carbohydrates

00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:54.890
are available, you
can consume them

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.840
or you want to, for
1,000 reasons you just

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.850
want to have some carbohydrate.

00:20:58.850 --> 00:21:01.790
I want you to have the
physiology to go through that

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:04.700
and not blow up the next
day or eight days later

00:21:04.700 --> 00:21:07.460
or fall asleep or whatever other
silliness people say, right?

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:08.437
Same thing with fat.

00:21:08.437 --> 00:21:10.520
I want you to also not
have to go through your day

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.560
without having to
have carbohydrate.

00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.280
I think that is also
equally a problem.

00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.680
I [? think ?] it's very clear
this is an issue, right?

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:20.180
So your gut health, your brain
function, your energy level

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:22.370
should all have the
resiliency to handle

00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:24.336
multiple different stimuli.

00:21:24.336 --> 00:21:26.580
But this is where we're
going to be optimal.

00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.726
And the more time you can, say,
pushing away from optimization,

00:21:29.726 --> 00:21:31.850
spending on adaptation,
the more things get better.

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.050
You don't need to do
those things as much.

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:36.620
So again, I'm not
saying, all right,

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:38.203
let's throw away all
the other things.

00:21:38.203 --> 00:21:42.470
Let's go back to just living
on water and broccoli and--

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:43.100
no.

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:46.190
I'm just saying sometimes
choose suffering.

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.265
Sometimes choose optimization.

00:21:48.265 --> 00:21:49.640
And if you can
think to yourself,

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.491
oh, boy, you know what?

00:21:51.491 --> 00:21:53.240
I haven't chosen
suffering in a long time.

00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:55.496
Well, then its probably time
to choose some suffering.

00:21:55.496 --> 00:21:57.120
I don't know if that's
weekly, monthly.

00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:57.660
I don't know what it is.

00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:58.800
It doesn't matter.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.591
But just having that--
and this is actually

00:22:00.591 --> 00:22:02.550
why the last word the
book is consciousness.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:07.530
Just having that awareness
to go, oh, yeah, all right,

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:11.010
and maybe it's time
that I sleep for 10

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:14.052
hours for 5 straight days.

00:22:14.052 --> 00:22:15.510
It's really
interesting what people

00:22:15.510 --> 00:22:17.286
will choose to suffer with.

00:22:17.286 --> 00:22:19.410
Some people will choose to
suffer through exercise,

00:22:19.410 --> 00:22:21.324
but they won't suffer
through any hunger.

00:22:21.324 --> 00:22:23.240
Or they won't suffer
through eating something.

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.920
They go, I don't like that.

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:25.750
Like, what?

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:27.370
You ran 20 miles
yesterday, but you

00:22:27.370 --> 00:22:29.828
won't eat something because
you don't like the taste of it?

00:22:29.828 --> 00:22:31.085
That last five seconds.

00:22:31.085 --> 00:22:31.960
That's a crazy thing.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.060
Some people will work and
sleep five hours a night

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.504
for weeks on end.

00:22:36.504 --> 00:22:37.920
But they won't do
the opposite end

00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.680
of the spectrum, which is,
OK, choose five days in a row

00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:42.854
where you sleep for 10 hours.

00:22:42.854 --> 00:22:44.520
They won't choose
that type of suffering

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.645
because they don't like it.

00:22:45.645 --> 00:22:47.190
They're bored, or I'm agitated.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:48.690
I can't sleep at
night, so I'm going

00:22:48.690 --> 00:22:49.710
to pull out my phone again.

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:50.400
No, no, no, no.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.160
Put that away.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.610
That's your suffering is not
checking your phone every two

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:54.997
seconds.

00:22:54.997 --> 00:22:56.580
Whatever your suffering
happens to be,

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.850
pick something that's
hard and just make sure--

00:22:58.850 --> 00:23:00.750
and I use these
examples like caffeine.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.276
But I want really--

00:23:02.276 --> 00:23:03.900
the goal of the book
and the goal right

00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.270
here today is to help you
think about other aspects

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:08.680
of your life.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.470
Maybe that's paying attention
to your wife more, right?

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.860
Maybe that's not reacting to
somebody in traffic as much.

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:16.482
Choose the optimization.

00:23:16.482 --> 00:23:17.440
Choose what feels good.

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.277
Choose what gets you fixed
the fastest right now.

00:23:20.277 --> 00:23:21.860
But then sometimes
choose what's going

00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:22.950
to be the long-term solution.

00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:24.574
And it's the same
thing I talked about.

00:23:24.574 --> 00:23:27.580
This is fixing the problem
versus the symptom.

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.550
The symptom is I woke
up today exhausted.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:32.380
I got to get a
bunch of stuff done.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:33.490
The symptom is fatigue.

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:38.390
But the problem was lifestyle.

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.270
The problem was lifestyle.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.044
So balance those two things.

00:23:42.044 --> 00:23:43.960
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, something
I've noticed a lot,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.610
and this might have come up
a couple of times before.

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:48.980
But it's I feel that our
peer group, especially

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.119
here at Google, we're
all around the same age.

00:23:51.119 --> 00:23:52.160
We do similar activities.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:54.840
But we try to optimize
for too many things.

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.060
Like in my own personal case,
like, try to be ketogenic

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.200
and also do jujitsu.

00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:02.690
And half way through a roll,
I mean, you practice the sport

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.481
as well, I'm like
halfway through the roll,

00:24:04.481 --> 00:24:06.800
I'm just like, yeah, I'm
going for that, I'm dead, man.

00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.192
Like, I can't do anything else.

00:24:08.192 --> 00:24:09.650
And so I had to
switch back to, OK,

00:24:09.650 --> 00:24:10.920
like let's get
more carbs in you.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.794
Let's get you a little
bit more ready in full

00:24:12.794 --> 00:24:14.435
so that when you're
rolling, like,

00:24:14.435 --> 00:24:15.560
those carbs are activating.

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.482
You have that energy.

00:24:16.482 --> 00:24:18.190
like I couldn't do
both at the same time.

00:24:18.190 --> 00:24:19.773
And so I had to pick
one or the other.

00:24:19.795 --> 00:24:20.545
ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.

00:24:20.545 --> 00:24:21.870
And that's a very good example.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:25.104
When you try to make
changes, so sometimes you

00:24:25.104 --> 00:24:27.020
have to be realistic
with expectations, right?

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.794
Not sometimes, pretty much all.

00:24:28.794 --> 00:24:30.710
In that particular case,
you had to understand

00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:31.670
what a true goal is.

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.160
Are you trying to get to
better jujitsu right now?

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.560
Are you trying to
get keto adapted?

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.250
Because sometimes those things
are going to be antithetical.

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.050
You have to understand-- if you
don't make that decision what

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.640
the true goal is a
priori, you'll never

00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.960
get to get to that change.

00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:46.740
Because when things
get hard, you're

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.160
going to start making the
change in your decision, right?

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:52.280
So the goal has to be I'm
going to get keto adapted.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.620
That means-- if
you're wanting to.

00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:55.700
I will stay with keto.

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.680
If that means jujitsu
suffers right now, fine.

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.870
I have to do that, because
I have to recognize

00:24:59.870 --> 00:25:02.030
the goal is over here.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:04.100
Or if the goal is
to be getting better

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.830
at jujitsu for that week, month,
block, whatever it happens

00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:09.246
to be-- this is strength and
conditioning programming 101,

00:25:09.246 --> 00:25:09.800
right?

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:15.170
Have a goal for the day,
week, month, quarter, year.

00:25:15.170 --> 00:25:16.985
Then understand be
true to that goal.

00:25:16.985 --> 00:25:18.360
So when things
start going wrong,

00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.180
you look back up the
chain and go, yeah, well,

00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.500
the goal of this week was this.

00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.874
And the goal this
month was that.

00:25:22.874 --> 00:25:24.720
Therefore here's my decision.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.510
And I understand
what to optimize for

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:28.140
and what to push
towards [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:33.260
SPEAKER 1: And so that
ability to change up

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.497
your eating style, so would
that also apply to working out?

00:25:36.497 --> 00:25:38.830
Like is there a variability
in strength and conditioning

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:40.250
too that you would recommend?

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.300
ANDY GALPIN: 100%.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.820
There should be variability
with all of these things.

00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:45.240
You should look
at your lifestyle,

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.690
whether that's your nutrition,
your exercise programming

00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.597
stuff, and think,
when is the last time

00:25:50.597 --> 00:25:51.680
I did something different?

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:53.055
You should think
globally, right?

00:25:53.055 --> 00:25:55.280
So how many of you
think it'd be good to do

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:59.634
the same workout every
day the rest of your life?

00:25:59.634 --> 00:26:00.800
I got eye roll there, right?

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.450
Of course that doesn't
make any sense.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.824
Then why do you think there's
one eating style you should

00:26:04.824 --> 00:26:07.370
do the rest of your life?

00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:09.164
That doesn't make any
sense either, right?

00:26:09.164 --> 00:26:11.330
So you shouldn't just be
keto the rest of your life.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.413
You shouldn't be carb heavy
the rest of your life.

00:26:13.413 --> 00:26:15.920
You shouldn't do any of these
things the rest of your life.

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:16.700
You can if you want.

00:26:16.700 --> 00:26:18.866
But there's no real reason
that you should-- there's

00:26:18.866 --> 00:26:21.580
one way to eat ever.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.386
But yet there's 1,000
ways to exercise.

00:26:23.386 --> 00:26:24.760
It doesn't make
any sense, right?

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.710
If you start going back
up the logic train,

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:31.120
you start thinking, what am I
trying to do with the exercise?

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:33.886
And many of us have different
goals, including things

00:26:33.886 --> 00:26:35.260
like I'm trying
to get healthier.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:36.634
I'm trying to lose
weight, right?

00:26:36.634 --> 00:26:38.014
Or I want more energy.

00:26:38.014 --> 00:26:40.180
When you think about what
the goal is, that actually

00:26:40.180 --> 00:26:41.440
determines the
outcome, as opposed

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.023
to working backwards,
which is to say,

00:26:43.023 --> 00:26:44.660
I'm going to do this program.

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:45.160
Why?

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.955
Because my friend
did it and loved it.

00:26:46.955 --> 00:26:48.580
That goes back to
what we said earlier.

00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:49.750
Well, your friend might
have been doing it

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:50.708
for a different reason.

00:26:50.708 --> 00:26:52.630
Or it's super popular
for a different reason.

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:55.030
You have to think about what
are you trying to get out of it.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:56.404
And this is-- I
won't do this one

00:26:56.404 --> 00:26:59.580
right now because I'm sure none
of you want to be this honest.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:02.260
But generally you've,
I'm sure, heard the rule

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.670
of three whys, W-H-Y, right?

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:06.580
It's three to five.

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:08.620
But when somebody comes
at you with a problem

00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:11.230
in the terms of
nutrition or diet

00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:13.050
and you say I want to get x.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.250
Why?

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.415
Why do you care about that?

00:27:16.415 --> 00:27:17.540
Why do you care about that?

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.610
Why do you assume if you
did this, it would do that?

00:27:19.610 --> 00:27:21.276
And that's always
what it comes down to.

00:27:21.276 --> 00:27:23.440
There's almost always
a broken assumption.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.893
Why are you assuming if you
eat less carbohydrates you're

00:27:25.893 --> 00:27:28.470
going to lose more fat?

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:30.590
Well, it just makes sense.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.190
That's it?

00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:33.930
You're going change your whole
lifestyle because of that?

00:27:33.930 --> 00:27:35.807
Oh, well, what do you
really want to do?

00:27:35.807 --> 00:27:36.890
I really want to lose fat.

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:37.520
Great.

00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.020
So if I give you a
plan to lose fat,

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.490
would you be happy, yes or no?

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:41.990
Yes.

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:43.730
If you loss the fat, would
you be happy, yes or no?

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:44.720
Yes, I would be.

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:45.410
Great.

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:47.160
Well, then, I'm going
to use whatever tool

00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:48.680
I can to help you lose fat.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.790
You brought a solution.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.107
You brought an option there,
which is a fine option.

00:27:52.107 --> 00:27:54.440
But I'm going to look at the
rest of the things and say,

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.730
that's not going to
work in your lifestyle.

00:27:55.730 --> 00:27:56.797
I know you've got kids.

00:27:56.797 --> 00:27:58.380
I know you've got
this thing going on.

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.010
This is not-- this is very
unlikely to succeed for you.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.620
So can I offer
you another option

00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:05.440
that I think is more
likely to succeed

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.354
that will get you to that goal?

00:28:07.354 --> 00:28:08.270
That's what I'm after.

00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:09.050
That's what we're always doing.

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.070
So with exercise,
it's the same thing.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.080
What are we trying to do here?

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:16.162
I'm trying to-- well,
my mom had osteoporosis.

00:28:16.162 --> 00:28:17.870
So I want to make sure
I don't have that.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.920
Oh, OK.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.037
Or my dad just had
a heart attack.

00:28:21.037 --> 00:28:23.120
And so I'm really thinking
about long-term health.

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:26.570
Or, hey, look, it's summertime.

00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:27.530
It's Venice.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.100
I need to get ready
to pop this shirt off.

00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:30.600
Fine.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.450
Whatever it happens to be,
let's get to the honest answer.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.790
And people are shocked
because I don't care.

00:28:34.790 --> 00:28:38.030
I actually don't think vanity
is the worst thing ever here.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:39.530
If that drives you
to exercise more,

00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:41.464
OK, that that can be
a problem at the end

00:28:41.464 --> 00:28:42.380
of the hormesis curve.

00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.000
It's like anything else, right?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.440
But for a lot of people,
fine, if that's what it takes.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:47.360
Well, then let's
talk about that.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.190
And now we're going to work
backwards to figure out

00:28:49.190 --> 00:28:50.835
what program or
style of training you

00:28:50.835 --> 00:28:52.460
need to do to get
that goal, as opposed

00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.450
to just picking a
style of training.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:56.220
Like, that doesn't
make any sense at all.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.860
And then of course,
when the goal changes,

00:28:57.860 --> 00:28:59.818
now we're going to rotate
training philosophies

00:28:59.818 --> 00:29:01.500
based on what the next goal is.

00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:02.930
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, and so speaking
of training and genetics,

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:05.240
like how much of what
you have is like fixed?

00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.700
Like, assuming
again that I become

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:11.420
the best Mexican-American UFC
fighter ever, how much of that

00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:13.250
is limited by what
I already have,

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.170
or can I completely
change my build?

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:16.555
Or am I kind of
just stuck as is?

00:29:16.555 --> 00:29:17.305
ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.

00:29:17.305 --> 00:29:19.280
So we've actually
ran a recent trial

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:20.710
with [? some monozygotic ?]
twins.

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:22.710
So these are twins that
have the exact same DNA.

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:24.354
So they're clones.

00:29:24.354 --> 00:29:26.270
And one of them had
stopped exercising when he

00:29:26.270 --> 00:29:28.087
was about 18 or 20 years old.

00:29:28.087 --> 00:29:29.920
And the other one had
continued to exercise.

00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.419
And at the time
when we tested them,

00:29:31.419 --> 00:29:34.220
they were in their early
50s, so really 30 years

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.080
of different exercise training.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.030
And while everything
that you in your body

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:42.780
is slightly different
here, generally at worst,

00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:47.179
you're talking about 50/50
genetics and lifestyle.

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:48.720
Some of the markers,
more aggressive,

00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:50.520
some of the things
we saw were closer

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:56.130
to 80/20 in favor of
lifestyle not genetics.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:59.220
The exposome is what some
people refer to this--

00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:00.120
anything not genetic.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.100
So it depends on what
you're talking about.

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.475
If you're talking
about something

00:30:03.475 --> 00:30:07.240
like how tall you are, that's
pretty much 100% genetic,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:07.740
right?

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:08.906
There's not a lot we can do.

00:30:08.906 --> 00:30:10.950
Sorry.

00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:14.880
But if you look at something
like your overall health,

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:18.700
or I'll pick maybe a
more specific example.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:21.550
We took muscle biopsies, and we
analyzed them for fiber type,

00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:22.050
right?

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:23.925
So most of you heard
this, fast twitch muscle

00:30:23.925 --> 00:30:25.190
fibers and slow twitch, right?

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:26.480
Well, unlike what
most people think,

00:30:26.480 --> 00:30:28.230
there's tremendous
plasticity within that.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.630
So you can swing back.

00:30:29.630 --> 00:30:32.460
You can go from fast to slow,
slow to fast really quickly.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.400
We've seen changes in fiber
type in as short as two weeks,

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.400
11 days really.

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:41.490
And in this particular
case, one of the twins

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:43.990
was about 50/50 fast
twitch to slow twitch.

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.080
And the other one was
about 90% slow twitch.

00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.070
So I really basically for
things like again height,

00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:52.480
you can't really change.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.830
But anything that has
any plasticity to it,

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:57.040
there really is no limit
to how much it changes.

00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:58.924
It only comes down to exposure.

00:30:58.924 --> 00:31:01.340
So the more often you do it,
the longer you have to do it.

00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.980
For example, if I
took these twins

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:05.410
and I had another 100
years to keep them going,

00:31:05.410 --> 00:31:07.699
they would continue to change.

00:31:07.699 --> 00:31:08.990
It's not a physiological limit.

00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:13.150
It's just a limit to exposure,
time and load, right?

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:14.840
And so you have
unlimited ability

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.220
to change virtually
anything about you

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.610
if you give it enough exposure.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:22.320
So that means you
have to be patient

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:24.014
and you have to do things often.

00:31:24.014 --> 00:31:25.680
If you're consistent
and you do it often

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.720
and you wait time,
basically anything

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.450
about your body, your
physique and especially

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.440
things like muscle, we
have virtually no limit

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.650
to plasticity
within our lifestyle

00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:37.900
or within our lifetime
at this stage.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:40.351
So everything really can change.

00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:41.100
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:44.610
Now, how related is that to
like the idea of epigenetics,

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.252
that some [? things ?] turn off
and depending on what you do?

00:31:47.252 --> 00:31:49.710
Does this go back to the twin
example that you just shared?

00:31:50.072 --> 00:31:52.030
ANDY GALPIN: Yeah, that
is one example of that.

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.696
So you have genes
that you can't change.

00:31:53.696 --> 00:31:56.340
You can't change the DNA
that you've inherited.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.650
But we've been doing
this for decades now.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:02.380
The idea that just
because you have a gene,

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.380
doesn't mean that gene
is going to be expressed.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.440
If that gene is not expressed,
no proteins are built.

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.750
No proteins are built,
nothing happens.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:11.940
So somebody that, say,
that gets a bad draw,

00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.148
because certainly people
get better draws genetically

00:32:14.148 --> 00:32:15.610
and some get worse.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:16.380
So for let's say--

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.949
I'll give you an
example, myself.

00:32:18.949 --> 00:32:20.490
I've done a bunch
of genetic testing.

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.750
And I have a lot of
markers for obesity.

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.500
And so if you calculate
the rough numbers,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:30.140
I have something like 15
or 16x the risk of obesity.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:31.599
And I'm not the
best-looking person

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:33.598
you've ever seen with
their shirt off over there

00:32:33.598 --> 00:32:35.630
at the beach, but it's
not too bad, right?

00:32:35.630 --> 00:32:38.460
Everyone else in my
family is obese--

00:32:38.460 --> 00:32:41.062
everyone, for the most part.

00:32:41.062 --> 00:32:41.770
I have the same--

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.780
I have very bad genetics when
it comes to those things.

00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:46.020
I have to work very hard in
my exercise and nutrition.

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:46.900
It's not just natural.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:48.441
I wasn't born with
a fast metabolism.

00:32:48.441 --> 00:32:51.110
That's all garbage, right?

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.850
I have the genetic
markers that give me

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:56.900
every excuse to be obese.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.710
But if I don't match
that with the lifestyle,

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:03.760
those genes are never going
to really matter that much.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.250
If, though, I gave my
lifestyle a little bit,

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:08.840
it would take off.

00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.850
Some people get a
lot-- some people have

00:33:10.850 --> 00:33:14.229
much higher on the obesity
thing than I, and they

00:33:14.229 --> 00:33:15.020
[? matched ?] that.

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:15.990
They eat pretty well.

00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:17.240
Their lifestyle's pretty good.

00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:20.660
But that's enough to really
send them off the edge, right?

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:22.340
And so they have
to work really hard

00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.380
and do everything to
just kind of stay there.

00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.102
Some people are on the
other end of that spectrum.

00:33:27.102 --> 00:33:28.560
Doesn't really
matter what they do,

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.684
they're not going to be on
the surface level obese.

00:33:30.684 --> 00:33:33.140
But keep in mind, a
major misnomer here

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:36.320
is skinny is not
healthy, and obese is not

00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.180
unhealthy necessarily either.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.862
Adding more fat mass
is generally never

00:33:39.862 --> 00:33:41.070
a good thing for your health.

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:44.930
But just because you're not fat,
does not mean you're healthy.

00:33:44.930 --> 00:33:47.930
And we have tremendous data on
this of hundreds of thousands

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:52.340
of people now in dozens of
studies across laboratories

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.140
across the world.

00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.520
Some of the most significant
predictors of mortality,

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:58.370
so this is when
you're going to die,

00:33:58.370 --> 00:34:00.870
are things like leg strength.

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.830
It's not obesity.

00:34:02.830 --> 00:34:04.740
It's things like VO2 max.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:07.252
It's not your cholesterol.

00:34:07.252 --> 00:34:09.210
So you could be somebody
who is, quote unquote,

00:34:09.210 --> 00:34:13.530
"skinny," have weak
legs, have a low VO2 max,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:17.730
and be at two to three times,
if not higher, the mortality

00:34:17.730 --> 00:34:20.178
risk of somebody who's
a little bit overweight,

00:34:20.178 --> 00:34:22.469
but they have a reasonable
VO2 max and a reasonable leg

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:24.416
strength because they're active.

00:34:24.416 --> 00:34:26.040
Like, if you want to
talk about health,

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.074
that's what health means.

00:34:28.074 --> 00:34:29.699
So it really depends
on are you talking

00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:31.656
about aesthetics or health?

00:34:31.656 --> 00:34:33.239
But those are different
conversations.

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:36.981
Just because you're not fat
does not mean you're healthy.

00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:38.730
You can be right above
that line of dying.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:39.969
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:34:39.969 --> 00:34:41.100
And so speaking
of lifestyle, you

00:34:41.100 --> 00:34:42.474
have this wonderful
analogy where

00:34:42.474 --> 00:34:44.159
you describe the
differences in terms

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.900
of eating between a cook,
a baker, and a chef.

00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.449
I would love for you to share
a little bit about that.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.469
ANDY GALPIN: So
like any analogy,

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:54.960
it's not perfect, right?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.724
But what I try to do
is, as I mentioned,

00:34:56.724 --> 00:34:59.390
it's a little bit a blend of the
soft sciences and hard science.

00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:01.495
I'm a hard scientist, right?

00:35:01.495 --> 00:35:03.120
It's quantitative,
or it's qualitative.

00:35:03.120 --> 00:35:04.860
Everything in my
world is quantitative.

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.690
Biopsy, you measure everything.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:09.572
Molecules, we measure singling
proteins, genes, like that.

00:35:09.572 --> 00:35:10.530
And there's no fudging.

00:35:10.530 --> 00:35:13.070
There's no, well,
you look pretty good.

00:35:13.070 --> 00:35:15.547
That doesn't work in
muscle physiology.

00:35:15.547 --> 00:35:17.630
But the soft sciences are
more qualitative, right?

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.680
And so what I try
to do is when I'm

00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.650
speaking to a client, an athlete
or even a student or even

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:24.810
my parents, or you
right now, there's

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:27.335
two conversations
that go on my head.

00:35:27.335 --> 00:35:29.460
Conversation number one
is, what's the information?

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.070
What's the thing
I'm trying to say?

00:35:31.070 --> 00:35:32.720
Conversation number
two is what's

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:38.340
the best way I need to say it to
you to have the impact, right?

00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.370
If I gave you every piece of
information, I know in my head,

00:35:41.370 --> 00:35:42.390
you can't execute.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:46.470
And oftentimes that confuses
you even more and makes you go,

00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:48.180
I'm out.

00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:50.160
Like, I just wanted
to one answer.

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.610
I want to start taking
vitamin C. Do I do it, yes?

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:54.390
No?

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.240
I'm out.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:58.892
So you have to have
two conversations going

00:35:58.892 --> 00:36:00.850
to translate what I think
I need to say to you.

00:36:00.850 --> 00:36:05.170
So my analogy that I make up
with the cook, baker, and chef

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.720
is my way of putting people
in personality categories

00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:10.800
for one simple metric
which is nutrition.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:13.465
That helps me understand how I
need to communicate with them.

00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:14.840
And it actually
works really well

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:19.010
because people fall
into this cook, baker,

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:21.261
chef analogy in every
aspect of their m

00:36:21.261 --> 00:36:22.260
but you may switch back.

00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:26.760
So when you go to work here in
a second, you might be a baker.

00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.060
But then with your own
nutrition, you might be a cook.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:32.810
So people aren't just a cook or
a baker in all aspects of life.

00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:34.260
It changes depending
on the roles.

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.676
So for example, for me-- and
I'll get into what this cook,

00:36:36.676 --> 00:36:38.270
baker, chef thing
is in a second.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.870
For nutrition, I am
definitely a cook.

00:36:41.870 --> 00:36:46.130
But when it comes to my taxes,
not the same way, right?

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:50.660
When it comes to fixing my car,
I'm totally a baker, right?

00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:52.610
I'm following every instruction.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:54.090
I'm not--

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:55.340
SPEAKER 1: This might go here.

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:56.180
Just put that there.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:57.020
ANDY GALPIN: Right.

00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:58.550
So these analogies,
do any of you

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:00.519
know the difference
between cooking and baking?

00:37:00.519 --> 00:37:01.810
I sort of just gave you a hint.

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:06.940
Baking is chemistry, right?

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:08.230
Baking is extremely precise.

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.750
You cannot do things in
different orders when you bake.

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:13.291
You can't be like, well, I'll
just get the baking powder out.

00:37:13.291 --> 00:37:14.560
Just toss some in.

00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.600
Not going to work.

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:17.080
Like, was that baking
soda or baking powder?

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:17.395
I can't remember.

00:37:17.395 --> 00:37:18.186
Just throw them in.

00:37:18.186 --> 00:37:19.997
Ah, put a little bit of both.

00:37:19.997 --> 00:37:21.580
Not going to work
in chemistry, right?

00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.850
SPEAKER 1: The YOLO
move, just put them both,

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:23.410
see what happens.

00:37:23.424 --> 00:37:24.840
ANDY GALPIN: Yeah,
exactly, right?

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:25.095
Generational.

00:37:25.095 --> 00:37:25.940
It's Millennials.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.670
It's what you do, right?

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:30.330
Cooking is that, though, right?

00:37:30.330 --> 00:37:32.750
Cooking is, well, OK, yeah,
you just kind of get it hot.

00:37:32.750 --> 00:37:33.710
Put it in the pan.

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.090
And put a little bit of
this, put a a little bit

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:35.540
that in there.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:36.830
Well, it doesn't really matter
if you have onion or not.

00:37:36.830 --> 00:37:37.621
Well, OK, I add it.

00:37:37.621 --> 00:37:38.700
It's going to kill it.

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.910
Just kind of toss
things around, right?

00:37:40.910 --> 00:37:43.800
So people process
information the same way.

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.190
How many of you, if I said,
look, for having me up here

00:37:46.190 --> 00:37:49.160
today, I'm going actually go
ahead and offer you my services

00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.930
for free for the next 30 days.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:53.240
I'll be your personal
nutritionist the next 30

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:55.105
days no charge.

00:37:55.105 --> 00:37:56.480
How many of you,
if I said, look,

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.242
I will write you a
specific program.

00:37:58.242 --> 00:38:00.200
I'll tell you exactly
what to eat, when to eat.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:00.830
You have to weigh.

00:38:00.830 --> 00:38:01.850
You have to buy a little scale.

00:38:01.850 --> 00:38:03.760
You have to weigh every
single thing you eat,

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.301
and you have to
report it back to me.

00:38:05.301 --> 00:38:06.952
And if you fail
one meal, I'm out.

00:38:06.952 --> 00:38:08.910
How many of you would
love something like that?

00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:13.010
Right?

00:38:13.010 --> 00:38:15.407
How many of you are like, what
if we met like once a week

00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:16.490
for 30 minutes or an hour.

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:17.990
You could ask me a
couple questions.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.240
I'll gave you some concepts
and then you went back.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:23.060
How many of you would like that?

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:23.990
Right.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:28.000
You are a baker.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.550
You're cooks.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:33.790
If we work together, and now
especially if you paid me--

00:38:33.790 --> 00:38:36.796
if you're paying me
$1,000 a month to do this

00:38:36.796 --> 00:38:38.420
and you wanted that
kind of information

00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.790
at that level of detail, and all
I gave you was, well, you know,

00:38:41.790 --> 00:38:44.630
just eat a little more protein.

00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:47.000
You'd be pissed, right?

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.691
You'd be freaking out.

00:38:48.691 --> 00:38:50.316
The great example,
I think, of all time

00:38:50.316 --> 00:38:53.100
is my wife, because she is a
baker when it comes to food.

00:38:53.100 --> 00:38:56.630
So when I first started helping
her years ago with nutrition,

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:59.950
I'd be like, oh, OK, just eat
a little bit of walnuts today

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:00.450
at lunch.

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:02.033
She'd be like, whoa,
what do you mean,

00:39:02.033 --> 00:39:04.910
like eight almonds
or walnuts, 11?

00:39:04.910 --> 00:39:06.860
What are we talking about here?

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.370
She came.

00:39:07.370 --> 00:39:08.060
She's a baker.

00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.252
Plus she came from that
counting calorie thing.

00:39:10.252 --> 00:39:11.210
She came from all this.

00:39:11.210 --> 00:39:17.214
And it gave her anxiety to
not have that information.

00:39:17.214 --> 00:39:18.880
You, if I gave you
all that information,

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.963
it would give you anxiety
because you're like, oh,

00:39:20.963 --> 00:39:22.510
my god, it's
controlling my life.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:24.610
It's too much.

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:28.290
So even though the answer to all
of your nutritional problems,

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:30.845
we'll just say, is
the exact same thing,

00:39:30.845 --> 00:39:33.220
I cannot communicate to you
how I communicate to the rest

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.210
of you.

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.099
It's going to be ineffective.

00:39:36.099 --> 00:39:38.140
So I have to have that
second conversation, which

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:41.799
says, OK, how does she want
to hear this information?

00:39:41.799 --> 00:39:43.090
And what do I need to tell her?

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:44.620
I can't give her too much.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:46.690
I can't give her too little.

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:48.260
There's a thing
called buy in, right?

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.260
You've got to be convinced and
excited it's going to work.

00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.460
And it's going to be overload.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:53.501
I got to make sure that
I'm trying to line you up

00:39:53.501 --> 00:39:56.505
with buy in, as well as
feeling good about, yeah, no,

00:39:56.505 --> 00:39:57.880
but I see why you
gave me walnuts

00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.120
because this was going on.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.540
And I see why you added
this because we were here.

00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.230
Perfect.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:04.041
That's going to fix my problem.

00:40:04.041 --> 00:40:05.290
You might not care about that.

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:07.350
You're like, look, I just want
to be little bit less fat.

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:08.141
Give me some ideas.

00:40:08.141 --> 00:40:09.610
What am I doing wrong?

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:10.210
Cool.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.710
And you're really
empowered by that.

00:40:11.710 --> 00:40:13.120
You're excited by that.

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.760
Versus added anxiety
to your plate, right?

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:19.390
So bakers need to be given very
specific instructions, even,

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:23.270
here's the secret, even if those
instructions aren't perfectly

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.400
right.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:26.550
It doesn't really matter.

00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:30.020
I don't know if you need to be
on 180 grams of carbohydrate

00:40:30.020 --> 00:40:32.140
or 280.

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.282
But if I told you that,
you wouldn't be happy.

00:40:34.282 --> 00:40:36.240
But if I walked out and
said, oh, yeah, no, you

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.500
need to be at 175 exactly.

00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:38.350
Don't go to 190.

00:40:38.350 --> 00:40:39.999
Be at 175.

00:40:39.999 --> 00:40:41.290
And you went, oh, sweet, great.

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.040
And then I turn and
went, I don't know.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.270
You would rather
hear that than not

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.297
hear that because
you have a plan.

00:40:48.297 --> 00:40:49.630
Some of you are planners, right?

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:51.010
Some of you like that detail.

00:40:51.010 --> 00:40:53.230
We can adjust the plan as we go.

00:40:53.230 --> 00:40:55.313
So are you going in a week
come back to me and go,

00:40:55.313 --> 00:40:57.055
look, I'm feeling,
bom, bom, bom, bom.

00:40:57.055 --> 00:40:59.495
Oh, OK, let's take those
carbs, and let's go up to 220

00:40:59.495 --> 00:41:00.370
and see what happens.

00:41:00.370 --> 00:41:01.300
OK, great.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:03.110
You just like having a plan.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.090
Like, some you don't want that.

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:05.800
That's too much.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.490
It's going to take
over your life.

00:41:06.490 --> 00:41:07.656
You're not going execute it.

00:41:07.656 --> 00:41:10.630
And the number one thing with
diet nutrition, the number one

00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:15.230
thing to actually changing
something is adherence.

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:17.840
If nobody does the plan,
then there is no plan.

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.596
So my cook, baker,
chef thing is trying

00:41:20.596 --> 00:41:22.970
to help people put them in a
position where they actually

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.750
might execute the plan.

00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.390
So give them something they're
going to be excited about

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.660
but doesn't give
too much anxiety.

00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:32.470
Now, what's a chef?

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.350
Is a chef following
recipes or not?

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.430
SPEAKER 1: No really.

00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:43.910
ANDY GALPIN: Why can a
chef not follow recipes?

00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:48.074
Because they followed the recipe
exactly for so many years,

00:41:48.074 --> 00:41:49.615
they have an advanced
degree in that.

00:41:49.615 --> 00:41:53.150
And now they understand
when to break those rules.

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:54.740
They understand
the consequences.

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:57.111
They understand how things
are working to a level.

00:41:57.111 --> 00:41:57.860
They can innovate.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:41:59.780
They can do things differently
because they know, OK, well,

00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:01.363
I'm going to do less
of that, but I've

00:42:01.363 --> 00:42:03.020
got to do this in the back end.

00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.080
A cook doesn't have that
experience or knowledge.

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:06.640
They didn't put in
the ground work,

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.360
the years of working,
to understand,

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.177
no, you can't just
throw the oil in yet.

00:42:11.177 --> 00:42:12.552
It's going to blow
up, and you're

00:42:12.552 --> 00:42:15.010
going to splatter hot oil
all over your face, right?

00:42:15.010 --> 00:42:17.509
But the chef probably did
that a bunch of times.

00:42:17.509 --> 00:42:19.300
That's how they learned
that those lessons.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.860
And now they can break rules
because they understand,

00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:21.830
well, you can do
this is, [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:21.830 --> 00:42:22.746
but you can't do that.

00:42:22.746 --> 00:42:25.430
But you can break that,
that, that and that, right?

00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:28.840
So a chef is somebody that
understands those rules to such

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:30.550
a level, I can go, boom.

00:42:30.550 --> 00:42:32.770
And I can weave back and
forth between communicating

00:42:32.770 --> 00:42:35.830
like a baker or
a cook with them,

00:42:35.830 --> 00:42:38.377
and I'm confident they won't
break those fundamental rules I

00:42:38.377 --> 00:42:39.460
didn't want them to break.

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:43.220
Or my ideal goal, of
course, is to work everyone

00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.350
up to being a chef
to where I can go,

00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:49.210
sweet, just call me
when you need me, right?

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:50.920
With any of these
things, I'm trying to--

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:52.670
and this is really a
big part of the book.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:56.083
I'm trying to push people away
from becoming self-dependent

00:42:56.083 --> 00:42:59.230
and becoming self-reliant.

00:42:59.230 --> 00:43:05.090
If you have to follow a textbook
or an app to eat every day,

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.254
you're becoming
dependent on that, right?

00:43:08.254 --> 00:43:09.670
That's not what
we want you to be.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:11.620
We want you to be self-reliant,
where you can go, OK,

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:12.911
this is a great starting place.

00:43:12.911 --> 00:43:14.770
This helped me
learn my body more.

00:43:14.770 --> 00:43:16.960
This diet that I followed,
and I followed it to a T,

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.760
I didn't make any
variations in it.

00:43:18.760 --> 00:43:20.760
I learned a lot more about
what I react well to,

00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:21.490
what I don't react well to.

00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:22.100
Great.

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.100
Now I'm going to ditch
the book, ditch the plan,

00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:28.402
ditch the magic thing and start
changing things on my own.

00:43:28.402 --> 00:43:30.610
No, I [? understand ?] that
triggered me really fast.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:32.318
Oh, my gosh, now I'm
feeling super tired.

00:43:32.318 --> 00:43:33.880
I'm nodding off after lunch.

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.740
OK, it's because I added this.

00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:36.465
I can't do that.

00:43:36.465 --> 00:43:38.590
I've got to make this
combination different, right?

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:42.580
And so it should be used to
help you advance not regress you

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:44.655
back to, oh, I
don't have my book.

00:43:44.655 --> 00:43:45.280
My app crashed.

00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.654
My phone died Oh,
my god, I don't

00:43:46.654 --> 00:43:48.686
know what to eat for lunch.

00:43:48.686 --> 00:43:49.810
That's what happens, right?

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:51.521
And we don't want
to be at that level.

00:43:51.521 --> 00:43:53.770
So you don't want to get
people-- when you give people

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.270
very specific answers,
they become reliant

00:43:57.270 --> 00:43:58.590
upon those answers.

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.610
And they don't become--

00:43:59.610 --> 00:44:00.940
or they become dependent
upon those answers.

00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:02.550
They don't become self-reliant.

00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:04.290
And that's really where we're
trying to get people to get to.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:06.373
Because anyone who's ever
had a significant change

00:44:06.373 --> 00:44:09.120
in their health
function or performance

00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.220
is a lifestyle change.

00:44:11.220 --> 00:44:12.720
And that's where
we're always trying

00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:15.090
to get people to get to, right?

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:19.860
If you make them dependent upon
external forces, information,

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.530
if you make them
be a perma baker,

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:25.480
they're never going
to become a chef.

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.212
But if you're always
a cook as well,

00:44:28.212 --> 00:44:30.420
you'll never know what to
do to become a chef either.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:32.240
So there's a little bit of
both we have to go back to.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:33.590
So that's generally what I do.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:37.140
So when I'm working with an
athlete, in my head I go,

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.195
OK, all right, Steve,
all right, he's a baker.

00:44:40.195 --> 00:44:41.570
I'm filtering
everything through.

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.330
Bakers do well with a
bunch of instructions,

00:44:44.330 --> 00:44:45.320
very specific detail.

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.030
Cooks?

00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:51.124
Short piece of information,
and they don't care why, right?

00:44:51.124 --> 00:44:53.040
So we'll go back there
again where I'm working

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.350
with you all as a nutritionist.

00:44:55.350 --> 00:44:57.960
If I gave you-- if I said, hey,
I want you to take 11 walnuts

00:44:57.960 --> 00:44:59.520
and eat those at 11:00 AM--

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.239
11:00, not 12:00.

00:45:01.239 --> 00:45:02.530
You'd probably go, cool, great.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:03.220
I'm in.

00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:03.720
Why?

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:07.770
You wouldn't give a shit.

00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:08.970
Be like, sweet, I'm on
it. [? Let me ?] go, 11.

00:45:08.970 --> 00:45:09.470
Here we are.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:11.170
We're done.

00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:13.600
Cooks don't care about the why.

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:15.190
Bakers tend to
care about the why.

00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:17.200
So the baker I spend more
time with the buy in.

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.130
I'm explaining to them
how it's going to work.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:21.255
Well, it's because we saw
this in your blood panel.

00:45:21.255 --> 00:45:22.840
We saw this in
your stool sample.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.548
We're doing this.

00:45:23.548 --> 00:45:24.640
OK, great.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:26.141
Cooks just want to
know the answers.

00:45:26.141 --> 00:45:26.640
Great.

00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:27.141
No question.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:27.640
I'm in.

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:28.170
I'm out.

00:45:28.170 --> 00:45:29.331
Come back in a month.

00:45:29.331 --> 00:45:30.580
Let me know if it didn't work.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.362
Great.

00:45:31.362 --> 00:45:33.820
And so it's just trying to help
them improve communication.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:38.150
And my decade as a teacher
has helped me build that.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:39.580
So although I'm
a hard scientist,

00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:43.510
I'm a quantitative scientist
by nature, I'm also--

00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:45.760
I spend a lot of time teaching.

00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:49.210
And so really I develop that
as a tool with both my students

00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:51.710
and my athletes as
a way of saying, OK,

00:45:51.710 --> 00:45:57.990
how can I change my system so
that I can improve for them?

00:45:57.990 --> 00:46:00.840
I'm not trying to make
all of my athletes

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:03.040
chefs or all my students.

00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:04.450
Some don't want to be.

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:08.140
Some of you might realize, like,
look, nutrition's not my jam.

00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:09.160
I want to be healthier.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.390
But I'm not going
to dive into it.

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:11.350
I'm not going to
start reading stuff.

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.350
Like, OK, great.

00:46:12.350 --> 00:46:14.350
I'm not going to try to
make that person a chef.

00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:19.640
I don't want you
to work how I work.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.220
I want you to work how you work.

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:22.600
You tell me how you work.

00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.190
And I will change to help you.

00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.690
That's my job.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:28.420
When you hire me and pay me
to help you do something,

00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.880
I'm not trying to push
you into my system.

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.210
I'm trying to change
to fit you and give

00:46:33.210 --> 00:46:34.650
a system to whatever you want.

00:46:34.650 --> 00:46:36.150
That's what I'm
really trying to do.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:36.900
SPEAKER 1: Got it.

00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.510
No, nice.

00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:38.920
That's a great
approach to everything.

00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.878
And the more that we can
adapt to our audience,

00:46:40.878 --> 00:46:43.400
whether it's in a workplace,
in a nutritional space, then

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.316
the more impactful the
message will be, right?

00:46:45.582 --> 00:46:46.790
ANDY GALPIN: That's the goal.

00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:47.570
SPEAKER 1: Nice.

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:50.930
So at this point, let's
open up to questions.

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:53.690
ANDY GALPIN: Oh, shocking,
she has a question.

00:46:53.690 --> 00:46:55.611
SPEAKER 1: So here we go.

00:46:55.611 --> 00:46:57.110
All right, we
practiced this before.

00:46:57.110 --> 00:46:58.210
So you got this.

00:46:58.210 --> 00:47:00.251
ANDY GALPIN: Oh, my gosh,
what are we doing here?

00:47:00.251 --> 00:47:03.260
[INAUDIBLE] That's
pretty athletic.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:04.640
AUDIENCE: Well, I do work out.

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.927
ANDY GALPIN: Ah, nice.

00:47:06.927 --> 00:47:08.510
AUDIENCE: Thanks
very much for coming.

00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:10.686
And I found the talk
very interesting.

00:47:10.686 --> 00:47:12.560
One of the things I
think is most interesting

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:14.630
is how much you've
talked about nutrition

00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:17.630
and how it's
extremely subjective.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.990
I mean, yes, you can call me
a baker, but for nine years,

00:47:20.990 --> 00:47:21.980
I was vegetarian.

00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.780
Seven years of
that, I was vegan.

00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.555
And that was kind
of by accident,

00:47:25.555 --> 00:47:26.930
but it was also
kind of because I

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:29.570
was told by a bunch of
friends that it was better

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:30.170
for my health.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:31.550
I read some books on it.

00:47:31.550 --> 00:47:33.860
They all said it
was better for me.

00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:36.440
And then I developed
hypoglycemia

00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.810
and really bad acid
reflux, which I didn't know

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.000
was caused by that.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.580
I went back to eating
gradually everything.

00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:47.480
And 10 years later, still
was hypoglycemic, still

00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:49.670
having problems with
the acid reflux.

00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:53.450
So I read the blood
type diet book

00:47:53.450 --> 00:47:55.430
I'm sure you're familiar with.

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:57.570
And it's like not
very scientific.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:47:59.700
But you know, I was
willing to give it a try.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:00.560
I'm a baker.

00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:05.030
So I followed the recipes
or the instructions.

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:07.335
And within two months,
my hypoglycemia was gone.

00:48:07.335 --> 00:48:08.210
ANDY GALPIN: Awesome.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.730
AUDIENCE: Within three
months, acid reflux all gone.

00:48:10.730 --> 00:48:12.770
And now I don't
follow it religiously

00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:15.830
because I've actually
graduated to being a chef.

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:18.210
I don't like to brag, but.

00:48:18.210 --> 00:48:19.615
ANDY GALPIN: It's totally fine.

00:48:19.615 --> 00:48:21.740
AUDIENCE: But I did experiment
with all this stuff.

00:48:21.740 --> 00:48:23.960
And what I've told
people, especially people

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:27.260
that we know that are
really hardcore vegetarians

00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.904
and vegans, is that
it's not for everyone.

00:48:29.904 --> 00:48:30.570
ANDY GALPIN: No.

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:32.700
AUDIENCE: And it really
is a personal choice.

00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:36.050
And it's not about the yes,
saving the planet is great.

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:37.910
And saving the animals is great.

00:48:37.910 --> 00:48:40.160
And saving the
environment is great.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.550
There's other ways I can
do that are not going

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:45.990
to affect how I feel every day.

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:48.860
And I was just wondering
what kind of advice

00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:50.900
do you offer to
people when they're

00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:57.305
so attached to a diet, which,
by the way, is from the Greek.

00:48:57.305 --> 00:48:58.710
It means way of life.

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:01.730
They're so attached to a diet
that actually is hurting them,

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:04.790
and they refuse for like
usually moral reasons,

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:07.570
like because of the animals,
they won't let go of it,

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:09.000
even though it's hurting them.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.458
ANDY GALPIN: So a
couple of things.

00:49:10.458 --> 00:49:13.670
Number one, the
vegetarian-vegan argument,

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:17.260
you have to tease out
ethics from health, right?

00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.790
Those are separate
conversations.

00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:21.604
You can't bleed back and forth.

00:49:21.604 --> 00:49:23.395
So I'll leave the moral
ethics stuff aside.

00:49:23.395 --> 00:49:24.311
It's not what I do.

00:49:24.311 --> 00:49:25.560
I can certainly comment on it.

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.820
It's not the best use of
our short time here today.

00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:31.300
The health thing is
the easier approach.

00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:34.570
As you mentioned, it
would be extremely

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:39.770
arrogant and short-sighted
for us to think all 7,

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:43.980
7 and 1/2 billion people
have to eat the same way

00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:49.320
and that our health would be
optimized eating the same way.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:53.480
It's undeniable some people do
fantastic on those diets health

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.410
wise.

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:56.520
It's also undeniable some don't.

00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:58.860
It's pretty silly
also to think you have

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:00.960
to eat like that to be healthy.

00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:06.060
Pick your evidence point,
evolutionary biology,

00:50:06.060 --> 00:50:08.085
randomized clinical trials.

00:50:08.085 --> 00:50:09.210
None of it lines up, right?

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:10.320
So any of that
[? is a ?] [? win. ?] And

00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:11.190
it's overwhelming.

00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:14.490
It's just-- you can't
ignore that, or even really

00:50:14.490 --> 00:50:16.620
ethically debate that, right?

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:18.160
You can't genuinely debate that.

00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.115
It's just silly.

00:50:19.115 --> 00:50:20.490
The bigger problem,
I think, that

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:25.000
puts into we as humans have
been around for a long time.

00:50:27.710 --> 00:50:33.040
How could you in a
objective logical mind

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:38.440
think we were the generation
that figured it out?

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:39.994
Are you kidding?

00:50:39.994 --> 00:50:41.410
What do you think
the generation--

00:50:41.410 --> 00:50:42.784
what do you think
someone's going

00:50:42.784 --> 00:50:43.990
to do in 10 years from now?

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:45.740
No, no, they're the
ones that figured out.

00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:46.462
[INAUDIBLE]

00:50:46.462 --> 00:50:48.670
And so I think if you run
this circle pattern enough,

00:50:48.670 --> 00:50:50.480
you realize, oh,
what's the answer here?

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:53.560
What's the common thread
between all of it?

00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.770
There is no single best diet.

00:50:57.770 --> 00:50:59.460
That's not going to exist.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.370
It never will.

00:51:02.370 --> 00:51:03.870
There is not a
single best approach.

00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:04.880
And again, why do
you think you even

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.960
have to do one approach
your whole life?

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.580
So why not go vegan,
vegetarian for a year

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.140
and then go back and
then something else?

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:13.640
Why not?

00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.250
Why does it have to be one
answer [? a ?] whole time?

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:18.110
Anyone that claims
that a diet like that

00:51:18.110 --> 00:51:21.710
is the single answer
for an entire generation

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:25.090
or an entire
population, maybe they

00:51:25.090 --> 00:51:26.840
have good intentions
in mind, but it's not

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:27.620
the right approach.

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:28.994
It generally
doesn't help people.

00:51:28.994 --> 00:51:30.390
So the second part
your question,

00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:32.431
how do you communicate
with these people that are

00:51:32.431 --> 00:51:35.260
entrenched, number
one, you can't.

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:38.180
If people aren't ready to
change, they don't change.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:40.589
Information always helps.

00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:42.130
But it has to be
genuine information.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:44.670
So for example, I
could very easily

00:51:44.670 --> 00:51:47.100
stand up here and
attack those diets

00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.450
from a science perspective.

00:51:48.450 --> 00:51:50.810
But I don't do that because
it doesn't help anything.

00:51:50.810 --> 00:51:52.320
People that like
vegan-vegetarian

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.830
are not going to
be excited by that.

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:55.121
It's not going to help anybody.

00:51:55.121 --> 00:51:56.740
People in the middle
don't like it.

00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.489
You can get a lot
more views on YouTube.

00:51:58.489 --> 00:52:00.030
Like, you could cut
a little clip out

00:52:00.030 --> 00:52:05.147
there like Dr. Galpin, blasts
vegetarian at a Google talk.

00:52:05.147 --> 00:52:06.480
I'm not interested in that crap.

00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:07.470
It doesn't help the movement.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:08.844
What helps is
information, right?

00:52:08.844 --> 00:52:10.920
And there's a ton of
information out there.

00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:12.540
And being genuinely
compassionate

00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:16.060
and empathetic for those people,
really trying to help them.

00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.670
And when they're ready,
again, my approach is--

00:52:19.670 --> 00:52:22.620
so I have worked with
vegetarian-vegan athletes.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.180
I have not once
uttered any of them

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:26.320
that we should
change their diet.

00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:27.750
Exception is the
one that has been

00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:30.570
like, hmm, I want
to do this because I

00:52:30.570 --> 00:52:32.490
thought it's healthier.

00:52:32.490 --> 00:52:34.412
That person, I said, well, why?

00:52:34.412 --> 00:52:35.370
Why did you think that?

00:52:35.370 --> 00:52:35.820
Why do you think that?

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:36.370
OK, great.

00:52:36.370 --> 00:52:38.100
And if they have a very good
reason, I'm not against it.

00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:39.300
I would go there.

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.890
I will use any tool
that they want.

00:52:40.890 --> 00:52:42.690
But I will never take a
person that comes to me

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:43.500
and says, look, I'm vegan.

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:44.700
I want to be vegetarian.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:45.750
But this and this is going on.

00:52:45.750 --> 00:52:47.730
I want to improve my health,
but I want to stay vegetarian.

00:52:47.730 --> 00:52:49.396
I would never start
the conversation off

00:52:49.396 --> 00:52:51.900
about how to get them
away from vegetarian.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.620
My goal is to help them succeed
with what they're doing.

00:52:55.620 --> 00:52:56.930
So that's my approach.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:58.490
Once they do that,
they're probably

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:01.314
more likely to understand
you care about them.

00:53:01.314 --> 00:53:03.480
And then they might start
opening up and being like,

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:04.880
well, really, what do
you think about-- you

00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.172
think it is healthier this way?

00:53:06.172 --> 00:53:07.713
And then I'll give
my honest opinion.

00:53:07.713 --> 00:53:09.830
But I'm not going to walk
in and start pushing.

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:12.380
When I have an athlete
that comes away with keto,

00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:15.150
my goal is not to push them
away from any of this stuff.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.400
I want to help them succeed
with what they want to do.

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:19.900
And if [INAUDIBLE] like, where
are you at a scale of 1 to 10

00:53:19.900 --> 00:53:23.720
on vegetarian-veganism in terms
of willing to give it up now?

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:24.821
I think I'm a nine.

00:53:24.821 --> 00:53:25.320
Great.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.278
I'm not even going to--

00:53:26.278 --> 00:53:28.670
subconsciously, I'm not going
to hit little jabs at them.

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:31.135
I'm not-- that's not
what they came to me for.

00:53:31.135 --> 00:53:32.510
They came to me
because they want

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:33.968
to get better with
what they're at.

00:53:33.968 --> 00:53:34.484
Fine.

00:53:34.484 --> 00:53:35.900
Just like somebody
that came to me

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.325
with a carnivore diet
or any other crazy diet.

00:53:38.325 --> 00:53:39.450
That's what you want to do?

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:39.770
Great.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:40.100
OK.

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:41.660
Well, I'll do my best to try
to help you through that.

00:53:41.660 --> 00:53:43.243
But I'm not going
to try to change you

00:53:43.243 --> 00:53:45.007
unless you want to change.

00:53:45.007 --> 00:53:46.340
Then I'll listen and maybe help.

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.570
But that's not my goal.

00:53:47.570 --> 00:53:48.861
I don't want everybody eating--

00:53:48.861 --> 00:53:51.210
I don't want everyone
believing my philosophies.

00:53:51.210 --> 00:53:52.460
I'll try to help you as I can.

00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:54.079
But that doesn't help anyone.

00:53:58.525 --> 00:53:59.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:02.960
So you said there's no
single solution for things.

00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:06.887
But also, want I have
like [? knee ?] condition

00:54:06.887 --> 00:54:07.970
or [? dental ?] condition.

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:10.340
I realize that there is no--

00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:13.780
even the experts
say different things

00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.770
about how to treat
my conditions.

00:54:15.770 --> 00:54:20.570
And so you've been working with
the best people in that area.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:25.490
So can you give us a tip on
how to find a good doctor

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:29.490
or nutritionist or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:29.490 --> 00:54:30.320
ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.

00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.850
That's such a good question.

00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:35.630
I get that probably more than
anything else when I do media

00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:38.270
or in a classroom.

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:42.220
It's something that I wish I
had perfectly solved myself,

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.210
but I don't.

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:45.470
You can look for
red flags, though.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:50.500
If anybody is selling a product
directly behind themselves,

00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.530
it's not biased.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:53.170
It's not guaranteed wrong.

00:54:53.170 --> 00:54:55.482
But if the answer to
every single person that

00:54:55.482 --> 00:54:56.940
walks in their
clinic is, oh, yeah,

00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.100
you've got to take
this thing, then

00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:00.890
you'll start to be
like, hm, weird.

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:02.681
The other ones you want
to pay attention to

00:55:02.681 --> 00:55:06.379
are the ones that are treating
symptom not problem, right?

00:55:06.379 --> 00:55:08.420
You want to find the ones
that address a problem.

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:10.640
And the last piece
I'll say to that is you

00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:16.080
want to find people that are
treating the entire system not

00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.610
the knee.

00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:19.140
Because the knee is a symptom.

00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.100
That's the signal.

00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:22.549
But that may not be the
cause of the problem.

00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:24.090
I don't know what
your knee issue is.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:26.700
But it might be something that--

00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:29.200
it might be because
of your neck.

00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:31.300
It might be because of
your right shoulder.

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.610
And so you want to find
a physician that asks

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:34.869
questions about everything.

00:55:34.869 --> 00:55:37.410
They'll sit you down and go,
OK, you're having knee problems.

00:55:37.410 --> 00:55:37.900
Tell me about the knee problem.

00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:38.920
OK, great.

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.300
Well, let me see you walk.

00:55:40.300 --> 00:55:41.660
OK, let's take this other thing.

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:42.910
Well, tell me about your diet.

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:44.847
Tell me when do you
feel most symptoms?

00:55:44.847 --> 00:55:46.180
When are you feeling a flare up?

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:47.320
What activities [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:47.770
OK, great.

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:48.770
Well, let's look
at your posture.

00:55:48.770 --> 00:55:49.610
Let's look at how you move.

00:55:49.610 --> 00:55:50.318
How do you sleep?

00:55:50.318 --> 00:55:51.520
What's your desk look like?

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.300
What's your car ride?

00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:54.090
Are you commuting a lot
[? or no commute? ?]

00:55:54.090 --> 00:55:55.048
OK, what's your stress?

00:55:55.048 --> 00:55:56.230
How much are you sleeping?

00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:58.462
That's somebody who
will fix your problem.

00:55:58.462 --> 00:55:59.920
So those are the
people I look for.

00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:02.880
If you're going to a physician
or a physical therapist

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:04.630
and they go, OK, what's
your knee problem?

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:06.921
Oh, the back of my knee hurts
when I stand up too much.

00:56:06.921 --> 00:56:07.510
OK, great.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:08.730
Do three sets of 10 of this.

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:10.000
Like, walk out.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.660
Gone.

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:12.640
Like, they're not
fixing anything.

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:14.590
Or if they're just
were like, OK, great,

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:16.630
start on these
anti-inflammatories,

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:19.242
and we'll see what happens.

00:56:19.242 --> 00:56:21.200
Not going to work, man,
like not going to work.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.900
So keep walking out
of those offices

00:56:23.900 --> 00:56:26.565
until you find somebody that
really treats the symptom.

00:56:26.565 --> 00:56:27.440
And it's really hard.

00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:30.470
Of course, I can give you
personal referrals to people.

00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:32.690
But I don't want to sound
like I'm plugging anybody

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:33.520
specifically.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:36.050
But there's tons of
people that do this.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:38.990
You can look up--

00:56:38.990 --> 00:56:41.600
I didn't want to say this,
but I'll just say it.

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:44.290
You can look up
functional medicine.

00:56:44.290 --> 00:56:46.150
Now, some functional
medicine practitioners

00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:47.980
are complete quacks.

00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.980
But a lot of them
tend to be decent.

00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:54.107
And that's a good start because
they tend to treat the body.

00:56:54.107 --> 00:56:55.690
It's a really bad
buzz term right now.

00:56:55.690 --> 00:56:56.710
Be very careful with it.

00:56:56.710 --> 00:57:00.550
There's a lot of hot and cold on
functional medicine right now.

00:57:00.550 --> 00:57:02.750
There's some bad stuff
going on with that as well.

00:57:02.750 --> 00:57:06.052
But some of that, they at least
are pushing the concept forward

00:57:06.052 --> 00:57:07.010
of treating the system.

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.301
I think one of the biggest
[? disservices ?] we've ever

00:57:09.301 --> 00:57:11.680
done in the field of
health and fitness

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.914
is teaching people
different body systems.

00:57:14.914 --> 00:57:16.080
You're in the muscle system.

00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.329
And you learn the bone system.

00:57:17.329 --> 00:57:18.540
You learn the nervous system.

00:57:18.540 --> 00:57:20.420
Because that's not
how that works.

00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:22.200
And it makes people
think siloed.

00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.950
Oh, I have a bone problem.

00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:25.290
Therefore, fix the bone.

00:57:25.290 --> 00:57:27.440
Well, it might be a nerve issue.

00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:30.030
It might be a gut issue.

00:57:30.030 --> 00:57:33.377
It might be the fact that
you don't sleep well.

00:57:33.377 --> 00:57:35.710
Turns out when you sleep well,
all these things go away.

00:57:35.710 --> 00:57:36.793
The body works in systems.

00:57:36.793 --> 00:57:38.470
We have multiple things, right?

00:57:38.470 --> 00:57:41.550
So when you fix those
big hanging fruit,

00:57:41.550 --> 00:57:44.130
everything tends to
start to line up.

00:57:44.130 --> 00:57:46.290
So I would go to a
physician or a therapist

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:48.270
or whoever you're
looking for that asks

00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:51.920
all the questions about
the lifestyle habits,

00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:53.200
and that fixes your problem.

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:56.126
So long answer, but
that's my real answer.

00:57:56.126 --> 00:57:56.834
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:58:00.442 --> 00:58:03.150
ANDY GALPIN: Oh,
so close, minus 10.

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.110
AUDIENCE: So you talk a lot
about like finding a balance

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.789
within the choices you
make and making sure

00:58:11.789 --> 00:58:13.830
that you understand the
consequence of the things

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:14.800
you do.

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.530
I'm curious to understand
how do you approach something

00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:20.910
like weight cutting, something
that like UFC fighters

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:25.500
have to do, like they just
have to make a certain weight?

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.350
ANDY GALPIN: I'll give
you a global answer.

00:58:27.350 --> 00:58:29.185
And then maybe you can follow
up with the specific thing

00:58:29.185 --> 00:58:30.805
because I'm not sure
exactly what you're asking.

00:58:30.805 --> 00:58:32.388
And so we you can
do a follow up here.

00:58:32.388 --> 00:58:35.110
But it's like anything else.

00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:37.160
During that extreme
weight cut, and we've

00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:40.270
been part of some
very extreme ones.

00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:44.570
You're talking people-- the
biggest one I've ever been,

00:58:44.570 --> 00:58:45.970
even just peripherally
a part of,

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:53.121
we're going to have go from
252 pounds down to 185 pounds.

00:58:53.121 --> 00:58:53.870
SPEAKER 1: Really?

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:57.660
ANDY GALPIN: Probably had 12
weeks for that or something.

00:58:57.660 --> 00:59:02.200
I've seen people go within,
let's say, on a Tuesday,

00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:09.120
weigh-ins are usually
Friday, go from 178 to 155.

00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:13.230
I've seen 20 pounds cut
in 24 hours or less.

00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:17.000
Of course, that's almost
exclusively water, right?

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.880
So the only way I manage that is
you go through those periods--

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.395
and I can tell a
story about this.

00:59:21.395 --> 00:59:23.270
I worked with an athlete
who won a gold medal

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:25.250
in Rio, the Olympics.

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:28.370
And about four months
out or three months out,

00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:29.990
the weight just
stopped coming off.

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:33.410
And that's because she had
been in a state of low calorie

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:36.420
for 9, 10, 12 months.

00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:40.710
And we had to match that
optimization with adaptation.

00:59:40.710 --> 00:59:42.360
So what we did
actually is we gave her

00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:45.990
a boatload of carbohydrate,
way up on calories, almost all

00:59:45.990 --> 00:59:47.500
from vegetable.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:49.000
And weight just
started flowing off.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.950
It started coming off, because
she had been so low calorie.

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:54.450
And with generally
with low calorie,

00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.305
you get low nutrient because
you just don't have quantity.

00:59:57.305 --> 00:59:58.430
We had to go the other way.

00:59:58.430 --> 01:00:01.045
So it was like, let's make the
body feel better for a minute.

01:00:01.045 --> 01:00:03.170
Let's give you a couple of
weeks of feeling better.

01:00:03.170 --> 01:00:05.799
And as soon as it did that, it
kind of relaxed, if you will.

01:00:05.799 --> 01:00:07.340
And then the fat
started falling off.

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:11.060
And she got down, made weight,
no problem, won a gold medal.

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:13.850
She became the first
American actually female ever

01:00:13.850 --> 01:00:15.960
to win gold medal in wrestling.

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.100
So this is a huge thing.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:21.191
She upset 16-times
straight world champion.

01:00:21.191 --> 01:00:21.690
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:23.539
So you have to match
it the same way.

01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:25.080
So when my athletes
come, I literally

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.697
had a conversation this
morning with one of mine,

01:00:27.697 --> 01:00:29.280
when you come off
that hard cut thing,

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.530
we have to match it
with let's restore.

01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:32.850
Let's recover.

01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:35.250
Let's not balloon
up to 250 again.

01:00:35.250 --> 01:00:36.610
But let's match it there.

01:00:36.610 --> 01:00:38.610
So that's-- but I'm not
sure what you're asking.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:40.542
Go ahead and follow up now.

01:00:40.542 --> 01:00:42.500
AUDIENCE: That was
basically what I was asking.

01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:46.650
But could you speak more
specific to like how do you--

01:00:46.650 --> 01:00:50.130
like after an event, after
they start to recover,

01:00:50.130 --> 01:00:51.931
how do you do it
in a way that's--

01:00:51.931 --> 01:00:52.680
ANDY GALPIN: Yeah.

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:58.080
So one key, I had someone one
time after a pretty big weight

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.460
cut, won a very big competition.

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:05.670
She was extremely
excited and had

01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:08.440
been on a very, very
clean diet for months.

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.780
And then she sent me a picture.

01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:13.060
She was on one of those
daytime talk shows

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:15.490
or something, one of the
big news things afterwards.

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:16.406
She sent me a picture.

01:01:16.406 --> 01:01:18.484
Like, they brought me in
and pizza and chocolate

01:01:18.484 --> 01:01:19.150
and other stuff.

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.640
And I'm like, do not eat that.

01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.320
I'm like, yes, it's reward time.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.550
But you're going to blow up.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:25.925
Like this is not--
and of course,

01:01:25.925 --> 01:01:28.000
she ate it and very
much regretted it.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.860
We'll put it that way, if
you get what I'm saying.

01:01:31.860 --> 01:01:35.410
Not what you want to be feeling
when you're on national TV.

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:38.171
Well, my point is it's just
going back to the same thing.

01:01:38.171 --> 01:01:39.670
We just started
increasing calories.

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:41.830
But you can't just
go off the rails.

01:01:41.830 --> 01:01:44.530
I made this mistake one
time after a personal weight

01:01:44.530 --> 01:01:45.610
cut of my own.

01:01:45.610 --> 01:01:49.590
And I went to a place that
serves wings and beer.

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.520
I was like, I have one beer
and a bunch of wings and fries.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.040
Oh, my gosh, the worst, right?

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:55.330
You feel awful.

01:01:55.330 --> 01:01:56.875
And so you bring in calories.

01:01:56.875 --> 01:01:58.030
And you can have a
little bit of a treat.

01:01:58.030 --> 01:02:00.520
But you have to work yourself
back into that stuff as well.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.100
And does [? the very detail? ?]
It's the same food.

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.420
You just eat a little more.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:09.460
It's more vegetable, more fresh
fruit, maybe a little bit more

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.360
fat, if you want.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:12.574
But you're eating
real whole foods.

01:02:12.574 --> 01:02:13.990
Once you do that
for a little bit,

01:02:13.990 --> 01:02:15.220
then you can actually
have the luxury

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.553
to eat ice cream or cake or
whatever little indulgence--

01:02:17.553 --> 01:02:18.160
wine.

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:19.150
Like, hers was wine.

01:02:19.150 --> 01:02:20.410
OK, fine.

01:02:20.410 --> 01:02:22.330
But you can't just
go off the rails

01:02:22.330 --> 01:02:25.330
and just go back from
really fresh, clean foods

01:02:25.330 --> 01:02:28.180
for nine months to garbage.

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:29.914
You're going to get destroyed.

01:02:29.914 --> 01:02:31.080
So that's really what we do.

01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:33.490
It's the same way
when we come back up.

01:02:33.490 --> 01:02:36.190
And you have to be careful,
though because about two

01:02:36.190 --> 01:02:38.530
months later, it was
like, yes, so remember

01:02:38.530 --> 01:02:41.640
how you said I can have a
little bit of chocolate now?

01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:44.540
Yeah, I'm pretty much eating
chocolate everyday all day.

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:46.172
All right, time to
tighten back down,

01:02:46.172 --> 01:02:47.380
like come back the other way.

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:49.046
So It's just balancing
those two things.

01:02:51.870 --> 01:02:53.710
SPEAKER 1: You guys
have any more questions?

01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:54.267
Perfect.

01:02:54.267 --> 01:02:56.350
Well, Dr. Galpin, it's a
pleasure and a privilege.

01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.740
Thanks so much for stopping by.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.860
And, yeah, you guys
check out his book.

01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:00.670
It's "Unplugged."

01:03:00.670 --> 01:03:02.530
A few more copies right up here.

01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:04.030
And, yeah, feel
free to hang around.

01:03:04.030 --> 01:03:05.988
Let's go get some steak
because it's steak day.

01:03:05.988 --> 01:03:07.060
So let's party.

01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:07.980
ANDY GALPIN: Perfect.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:08.855
Thanks for having me.

01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:10.620
