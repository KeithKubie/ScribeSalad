00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699
 
in this video and show you a slightly

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709
in this video and show you a slightly
 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.830
in this video and show you a slightly
more complex example where the slope of

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
more complex example where the slope of
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.269
more complex example where the slope of
the function can be different at

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279
the function can be different at
 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.980
the function can be different at
different points in the function the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990
different points in the function the
 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.930
different points in the function the
slots of an example here I plot to the

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940
slots of an example here I plot to the
 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.410
slots of an example here I plot to the
function f of a equals a squared let's

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
function f of a equals a squared let's
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.220
function f of a equals a squared let's
again look at the point a equals two so

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
again look at the point a equals two so
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.420
again look at the point a equals two so
a square is what f of a is equal to four

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:19.430
a square is what f of a is equal to four
 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.849
a square is what f of a is equal to four
let's nut a slightly to the right so now

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859
let's nut a slightly to the right so now
 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.070
let's nut a slightly to the right so now
a is equal to two point zero zero one f

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
a is equal to two point zero zero one f
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.800
a is equal to two point zero zero one f
of a which is a squared it's going to be

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
of a which is a squared it's going to be
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.279
of a which is a squared it's going to be
approximately four point zero zero four

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289
approximately four point zero zero four
 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.770
approximately four point zero zero four
it turns out that the exact value your

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780
it turns out that the exact value your
 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.630
it turns out that the exact value your
partner calculating figure this out it's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
partner calculating figure this out it's
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.190
partner calculating figure this out it's
actually four point zero zero four zero

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200
actually four point zero zero four zero
 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.180
actually four point zero zero four zero
zero one but I'm just to say 4.04 is

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190
zero one but I'm just to say 4.04 is
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.160
zero one but I'm just to say 4.04 is
close enough so what this means is that

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170
close enough so what this means is that
 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.069
close enough so what this means is that
when a is equal to two let's draw this

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079
when a is equal to two let's draw this
 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.139
when a is equal to two let's draw this
on the plot so what we're saying is that

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149
on the plot so what we're saying is that
 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.799
on the plot so what we're saying is that
if a is equal to 2 then F of a is equal

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809
if a is equal to 2 then F of a is equal
 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.860
if a is equal to 2 then F of a is equal
to four and here at the um x and y axes

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870
to four and here at the um x and y axes
 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.260
to four and here at the um x and y axes
are not drawn to scale technically this

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
are not drawn to scale technically this
 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.910
are not drawn to scale technically this
vertical height should be much higher

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920
vertical height should be much higher
 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.979
vertical height should be much higher
than this horizontal height so the x and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
than this horizontal height so the x and
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.770
than this horizontal height so the x and
y axes are not on the same scale um but

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780
y axes are not on the same scale um but
 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.800
y axes are not on the same scale um but
if I now nudge a to two point zero 1

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810
if I now nudge a to two point zero 1
 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.950
if I now nudge a to two point zero 1
then F of a becomes roughly four point

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
then F of a becomes roughly four point
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.200
then F of a becomes roughly four point
zero four so if you draw this little

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210
zero four so if you draw this little
 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.840
zero four so if you draw this little
triangle again what this means is that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850
triangle again what this means is that
 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.649
triangle again what this means is that
if I know eight to the right by 0.01 F

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
if I know eight to the right by 0.01 F
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.149
if I know eight to the right by 0.01 F
of a goes up four times as much by 0.04

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
of a goes up four times as much by 0.04
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550
of a goes up four times as much by 0.04
so in the language of calculus we say

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560
so in the language of calculus we say
 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.510
so in the language of calculus we say
that the slope that is the derivative of

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520
that the slope that is the derivative of
 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.760
that the slope that is the derivative of
f of a at a equals two is four or to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770
f of a at a equals two is four or to
 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.319
f of a at a equals two is four or to
write this out without calculus notation

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329
write this out without calculus notation
 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.390
write this out without calculus notation
we say that Dda

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400
we say that Dda
 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.749
we say that Dda
of f of a is equal to four when a is

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759
of f of a is equal to four when a is
 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389
of f of a is equal to four when a is
equal to two now one thing about this

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399
equal to two now one thing about this
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.850
equal to two now one thing about this
function f of a equals a squared is that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860
function f of a equals a squared is that
 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.440
function f of a equals a squared is that
the slope is different for different

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450
the slope is different for different
 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.870
the slope is different for different
values of a this is different than the

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
values of a this is different than the
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210
values of a this is different than the
example we saw on the previous slide so

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220
example we saw on the previous slide so
 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.270
example we saw on the previous slide so
let's look at a different point if a is

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
let's look at a different point if a is
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.410
let's look at a different point if a is
equal to five

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420
equal to five
 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810
equal to five
since F equals two in half equals five

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
since F equals two in half equals five
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.590
since F equals two in half equals five
then a squared is equal to 25 so that's

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600
then a squared is equal to 25 so that's
 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.469
then a squared is equal to 25 so that's
F of a if I know eight to the right

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479
F of a if I know eight to the right
 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.410
F of a if I know eight to the right
again just tiny little notch to 8 so now

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420
again just tiny little notch to 8 so now
 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.920
again just tiny little notch to 8 so now
a is five point zero 1 then F of a will

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
a is five point zero 1 then F of a will
 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.670
a is five point zero 1 then F of a will
be approximately

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
be approximately
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.800
be approximately
the twenty five point zero one zero so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
the twenty five point zero one zero so
 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.559
the twenty five point zero one zero so
what we see is that by nudging a up by

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569
what we see is that by nudging a up by
 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.949
what we see is that by nudging a up by
point over one f of a goes out ten times

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959
point over one f of a goes out ten times
 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.490
point over one f of a goes out ten times
as much so we have that D da f of a is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500
as much so we have that D da f of a is
 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.220
as much so we have that D da f of a is
equal to ten when a is equal to five

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230
equal to ten when a is equal to five
 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.649
equal to ten when a is equal to five
because F of a goes out ten times as

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659
because F of a goes out ten times as
 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.839
because F of a goes out ten times as
much as a does when I make a tiny little

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849
much as a does when I make a tiny little
 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.330
much as a does when I make a tiny little
nudge to a so one way to see why the

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340
nudge to a so one way to see why the
 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.770
nudge to a so one way to see why the
derivative is different at different

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780
derivative is different at different
 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.050
derivative is different at different
points is that if you draw that need a

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060
points is that if you draw that need a
 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.059
points is that if you draw that need a
little triangle right at different

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069
little triangle right at different
 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.640
little triangle right at different
locations on this you see that the ratio

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650
locations on this you see that the ratio
 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.190
locations on this you see that the ratio
of the height of the triangle over the

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200
of the height of the triangle over the
 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.500
of the height of the triangle over the
width of the triangle is very different

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510
width of the triangle is very different
 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.929
width of the triangle is very different
at different points on the curve so here

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939
at different points on the curve so here
 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.750
at different points on the curve so here
the slope is equal to more when a is

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760
the slope is equal to more when a is
 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.819
the slope is equal to more when a is
equal to two but is equal to ten when a

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829
equal to two but is equal to ten when a
 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.339
equal to two but is equal to ten when a
is equal to five now if you pull up a

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349
is equal to five now if you pull up a
 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.709
is equal to five now if you pull up a
calculus textbook in calculus textbook

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:03.719
calculus textbook in calculus textbook
 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:07.339

will tell you that DD a of F of a so f

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349
will tell you that DD a of F of a so f
 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:09.020
will tell you that DD a of F of a so f
of a is equal to a square so that's D da

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030
of a is equal to a square so that's D da
 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.000
of a is equal to a square so that's D da
of a squared one of the formulas you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010
of a squared one of the formulas you
 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.740
of a squared one of the formulas you
find that a calculus textbook is that

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750
find that a calculus textbook is that
 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.629
find that a calculus textbook is that
this thing the slope of the function a

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639
this thing the slope of the function a
 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:17.149
this thing the slope of the function a
squared is equal to 2a not going to

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159
squared is equal to 2a not going to
 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.589
squared is equal to 2a not going to
prove this but the way you find this out

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599
prove this but the way you find this out
 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.439
prove this but the way you find this out
is that you open up a calculus textbook

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:21.449
is that you open up a calculus textbook
 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:24.050
is that you open up a calculus textbook
to the table formulas and they'll tell

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060
to the table formulas and they'll tell
 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.420
to the table formulas and they'll tell
you the derivative of two of a squared

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430
you the derivative of two of a squared
 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.960
you the derivative of two of a squared
is equal to 2a and indeed this is

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970
is equal to 2a and indeed this is
 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.429
is equal to 2a and indeed this is
consistent with what we've worked out

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439
consistent with what we've worked out
 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:34.520
consistent with what we've worked out
namely when a is equal to 2 the slope

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530
namely when a is equal to 2 the slope
 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.000
namely when a is equal to 2 the slope
the function to a is 2 times 2 is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010
the function to a is 2 times 2 is
 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.819
the function to a is 2 times 2 is
therefore equal to 4 and when a is equal

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829
therefore equal to 4 and when a is equal
 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.280
therefore equal to 4 and when a is equal
to 5 then the slope of the function two

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290
to 5 then the slope of the function two
 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.159
to 5 then the slope of the function two
times a is 2 times 5 is equal to 10 so

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169
times a is 2 times 5 is equal to 10 so
 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.219
times a is 2 times 5 is equal to 10 so
if you ever proper calculus textbook and

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229
if you ever proper calculus textbook and
 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.619
if you ever proper calculus textbook and
you see this formula that the derivative

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629
you see this formula that the derivative

4.04 exactly is because derivatives are

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900
4.04 exactly is because derivatives are
 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.640
4.04 exactly is because derivatives are

small is not infinitely small so that's
 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.320
small is not infinitely small so that's
why the amounts that F of a went up

a calculus textbooks

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000
a calculus textbooks
 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.209
a calculus textbooks
formula table and will tell you that the

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219
formula table and will tell you that the
 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.209
formula table and will tell you that the
derivative is equal to 2a and so the

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:35.219
derivative is equal to 2a and so the
 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:37.070
derivative is equal to 2a and so the
example we went through was that if n is

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080
example we went through was that if n is
 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:40.640
example we went through was that if n is
equal to 2 F of a equals 4 and then we

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650
equal to 2 F of a equals 4 and then we
 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.730
equal to 2 F of a equals 4 and then we
nudge a so it's a little bit bigger then

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740
nudge a so it's a little bit bigger then
 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.170
nudge a so it's a little bit bigger then
F of a is about 4.04 and so f of a went

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180
F of a is about 4.04 and so f of a went
 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.959
F of a is about 4.04 and so f of a went
up four times as much and indeed when a

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:50.969
up four times as much and indeed when a
 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:52.930
up four times as much and indeed when a
is equal to two the derivative is equal

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940
is equal to two the derivative is equal
 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.909
is equal to two the derivative is equal
let's look at some other examples let's

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919
let's look at some other examples let's
 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.029
let's look at some other examples let's

you go to a calculus textbook and look

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169
you go to a calculus textbook and look
 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.279
you go to a calculus textbook and look
up the table of formulas you see that

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:04.289
up the table of formulas you see that
 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:06.379

3a squared so you can you know get this
 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.749
3a squared so you can you know get this
formula out of a calculus textbook so

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759
formula out of a calculus textbook so
 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.779

what this means so the way to interpret

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:17.789
what this means so the way to interpret
 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:20.540
what this means so the way to interpret
this is as follows let's take n equals 2

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550
this is as follows let's take n equals 2
 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.330
this is as follows let's take n equals 2
as an example again so f of a or 8 cubed

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340
as an example again so f of a or 8 cubed
 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.469
as an example again so f of a or 8 cubed
is equal to 8 does 2 to the power 3 so

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:27.479
is equal to 8 does 2 to the power 3 so
 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.200
is equal to 8 does 2 to the power 3 so
if we give a a tiny little lunch

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210
if we give a a tiny little lunch
 

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.189
if we give a a tiny little lunch
you find that f of a is about eight

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:34.199
you find that f of a is about eight

check this take two point zero zero one
to the power

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330
to the power
 

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.300
to the power
me you find that it's very close to

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:41.310
me you find that it's very close to
 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.059
me you find that it's very close to
eight point zero one two and indeed when

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:44.069
eight point zero one two and indeed when
 

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:47.119
eight point zero one two and indeed when
a is equal to 2 that's 3 times 2 squared

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:47.129
a is equal to 2 that's 3 times 2 squared
 

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:50.300
a is equal to 2 that's 3 times 2 squared
that's equal to 3 times 4 is equal to 12

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310
that's equal to 3 times 4 is equal to 12
 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.879
that's equal to 3 times 4 is equal to 12
so the derivative formula predicts that

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889
so the derivative formula predicts that
 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:54.589
so the derivative formula predicts that
if you nudge 8 to the right by time a

00:06:54.589 --> 00:06:54.599
if you nudge 8 to the right by time a
 

00:06:54.599 --> 00:06:57.290
if you nudge 8 to the right by time a
little bit F of a should go up 12 12

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300
little bit F of a should go up 12 12
 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.689
little bit F of a should go up 12 12
times as much and indeed this is true

00:06:59.689 --> 00:06:59.699
times as much and indeed this is true
 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:03.140
times as much and indeed this is true
when a went up by 0.001 F of a went up

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150
when a went up by 0.001 F of a went up
 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.950
when a went up by 0.001 F of a went up
12 times as much by 0.01 to just one

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960
12 times as much by 0.01 to just one
 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.379
12 times as much by 0.01 to just one
last example and it will wrap up let's

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:09.389
last example and it will wrap up let's
 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:11.240
last example and it will wrap up let's
say the F of a is equal to the log

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250
say the F of a is equal to the log
 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:14.209
say the F of a is equal to the log
function right so I'm gonna write log of

00:07:14.209 --> 00:07:14.219
function right so I'm gonna write log of
 

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:16.879
function right so I'm gonna write log of
a and I'm gonna use this as the base a

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:16.889
a and I'm gonna use this as the base a
 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:18.980
a and I'm gonna use this as the base a
logarithm so some people write that as

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:18.990
logarithm so some people write that as
 

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.890
logarithm so some people write that as
log log of a so if you go to a calculus

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:21.900
log log of a so if you go to a calculus
 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.570
log log of a so if you go to a calculus
textbook you'll find that when you take

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:23.580
textbook you'll find that when you take
 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.529
textbook you'll find that when you take
the derivative of log of a so this is a

00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539
the derivative of log of a so this is a
 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:29.629
the derivative of log of a so this is a
function that it just looks like that

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639
function that it just looks like that
 

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:33.529
function that it just looks like that
the slope of this function is given by 1

00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539
the slope of this function is given by 1
 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.559
the slope of this function is given by 1
over a so the way to interpret this is

00:07:36.559 --> 00:07:36.569
over a so the way to interpret this is
 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:40.219
over a so the way to interpret this is
that if a is any value again let's just

00:07:40.219 --> 00:07:40.229
that if a is any value again let's just
 

00:07:40.229 --> 00:07:42.679
that if a is any value again let's just
keep using equals 2 as an example and

00:07:42.679 --> 00:07:42.689
keep using equals 2 as an example and
 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:47.240
keep using equals 2 as an example and
you nudge a to the right by 0.001 you

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.250
you nudge a to the right by 0.001 you
 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.920
you nudge a to the right by 0.001 you
would expect F of a to go up by 1 over a

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:51.930
would expect F of a to go up by 1 over a
 

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.529
would expect F of a to go up by 1 over a
that despite the derivative times the

00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539
that despite the derivative times the
 

00:07:54.539 --> 00:07:57.309
that despite the derivative times the
amounts that you increase a so in fact

00:07:57.309 --> 00:07:57.319
amounts that you increase a so in fact
 

00:07:57.319 --> 00:08:01.100
amounts that you increase a so in fact
if you plop a calculator you find that

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.110
if you plop a calculator you find that
 

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:07.029
if you plop a calculator you find that
if a is equal to 2 F of a is about

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:07.039
 
 

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:12.619
 
0.6931 5 and if you increase F and if

00:08:12.619 --> 00:08:12.629
0.6931 5 and if you increase F and if
 

00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:16.999
0.6931 5 and if you increase F and if
you increase a to 2.0 1 then F of a is

00:08:16.999 --> 00:08:17.009
you increase a to 2.0 1 then F of a is
 

00:08:17.009 --> 00:08:26.540
you increase a to 2.0 1 then F of a is
about 0.693 6 5 so it's gone up by 0.005

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:26.550
about 0.693 6 5 so it's gone up by 0.005
 

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:28.850
about 0.693 6 5 so it's gone up by 0.005
and indeed if you look at the formula

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860
and indeed if you look at the formula
 

00:08:28.860 --> 00:08:32.420
and indeed if you look at the formula
for the derivative when a is equal to 2d

00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.430
for the derivative when a is equal to 2d
 

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:36.829
for the derivative when a is equal to 2d
da f of a is equal to 1/2 so this

00:08:36.829 --> 00:08:36.839
da f of a is equal to 1/2 so this
 

00:08:36.839 --> 00:08:39.290
da f of a is equal to 1/2 so this
derivative formula predicts that if you

00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:39.300
derivative formula predicts that if you
 

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.889
derivative formula predicts that if you
bump up a by 0.001 you would expect F of

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899
bump up a by 0.001 you would expect F of
 

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.199
bump up a by 0.001 you would expect F of
a to go up by only one half as much and

00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:45.209
a to go up by only one half as much and
 

00:08:45.209 --> 00:08:49.670
a to go up by only one half as much and
one half 0.001 is 0.005

00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680
one half 0.001 is 0.005
 

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.859
one half 0.001 is 0.005
which is exactly what we got right that

00:08:51.859 --> 00:08:51.869

00:08:51.869 --> 00:08:54.920
which is exactly what we got right that
when a goes up by 0.001 going from

case when a is equal to 2 that's just

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480
case when a is equal to 2 that's just
 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:26.480
