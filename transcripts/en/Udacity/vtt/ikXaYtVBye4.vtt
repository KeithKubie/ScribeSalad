00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.520
So far, we've been discussing the role
that the view controller plays as

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.939
the delegate and
data source for a table.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.110
We've also implemented the methods,
number of rows in section, and self row,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.570
and index path.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.270
Now let's do something different.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.740
In the favorite things app, the table
was already set up in storyboard and

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.660
you wrote the view controller code.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.070
In the next step, Bond villains,
we'll do the opposite.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.850
The view controller is ready to go.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.270
Your job is to set up the storyboard.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.120
This app displays villains
from James Bond movies

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.040
along with their evil schemes.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.110
In the version you're about
to check out, the model and

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.830
view controller are complete,
but the table doesn't exist yet.
