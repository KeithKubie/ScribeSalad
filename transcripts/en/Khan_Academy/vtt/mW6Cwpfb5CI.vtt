00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.210
- [Instructor] Let's say
that we run ABC Watch Factory

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.200
and we want to understand the
economics of our business.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.510
So, what we have in this table

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.320
is some data that we've already been able

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.840
to estimate or measure based
on how our business is running

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.270
and then we're gonna be able to figure out

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.279
some other things based on this data.

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.720
This first column is fixed costs,

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.600
our monthly fixed costs,

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.650
so these are the things
that we can't really change

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.980
in the short run regardless
of how many people we hire

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.920
or how many units we produce,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.970
so that might be the
rent on our facilities

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.460
or the cost of renting the equipment

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.470
and so, for us that's $5,000 a month.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.200
Then you have your labor units

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.890
and for the sake for this model,

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.650
we'll say that a labor unit
is a full-time employee

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.230
who's at the factory
working every working day

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.190
in a month and so, you can see,

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.330
we can go from one
person working full time

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.450
every working day in a month,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.460
all the way up to six.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.070
Now, this is the variable cost

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.991
and for simplicity, this is mainly driven

00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:04.030
by the labor units and
a real-world example

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.660
would be driven by the labor units,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.650
it would be driven by how
much material we're using

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.910
to produce the watches

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.710
but we have our variable
cost right over here.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.980
And then we have our total cost

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:17.610
which is just simply the fixed
costs plus the variable cost

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.080
for any given level of labor units

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.280
and then we know how many
watches we can produce in a month

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.860
based on our number of labor units

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.710
or you could view it as
based on our total costs

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.600
or based on our fixed and variable cost.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.920
Now, what we have here are other things

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.900
that we would wanna look at.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.860
If we really wanna understand
how our factory works.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.020
So, this is the marginal product of labor,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.140
MPL for short, then you
have your marginal cost,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.270
then you have your average variable cost,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.130
then you have your average fixed costs

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.210
and then you have your
average total costs,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.070
so like always, pause this video

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.470
and try to fill what these values would be

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.430
for even one row of this table

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.880
and then I'll do it with you.

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:58.623
Now let's do it together.

00:01:58.623 --> 00:02:00.310
Let's start with marginal
product of labor.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:02.110
Let's remind ourselves what that is.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.051
That says for every
incremental labor unit,

00:02:06.051 --> 00:02:09.550
how much more are we able to produce?

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.470
And so, we'd have to
start at the second one

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.460
'cause we have to think about
it incremental labor unit.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.660
So, as we go from one to labor units,

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.080
we were able to go from
10 to 25 total output,

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.300
so we were able to
produce 15 more watches.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.030
I could just type in 15

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.740
but it's even better
to do it with a formula

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.260
so I can just scroll it
down the rest of the rows.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.410
So, in this formula,

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.947
I wanna find the difference
in my total output,

00:02:34.947 --> 00:02:39.947
so 25, that cell minus this cell,

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.900
that that's saying hey look,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.440
I was able to grow 15 output

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.730
or increase my output by 15

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.730
when I increase labor by two minus one.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.440
And then I got my marginal
product of labor is 15

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.030
when I went from one employee to two

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.410
and then I can just figure that out

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.100
for the other rows, that's the
value of using a spreadsheet.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.220
My marginal product of labor

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.340
when I went from two
employees to three employees

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.060
is 20, so that means by
adding that third employee,

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.900
I'm able to produce 20
more watches per month

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.100
and so, you might be noticing
two interesting trends here.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.830
Initially my marginal
product of labor seems

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.300
to be increasing and then
it seems to be decreasing.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.070
And that's consistent with
the way a lot of businesses

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.941
or factories work

00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:30.430
which is initially you're
getting the benefits

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.300
of specialization where if you
only have one person working

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.350
in your factory, they
have to do everything,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.030
they have to polish the glass

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.351
and bring in the boxes
and talk to your suppliers

00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:43.990
and fit the gears on your watches

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:45.890
and whatever and do the wiring

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.420
while as you add more people,

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.720
they can start to specialize.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.730
One person can specialize on assembly.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.600
Another person can specialize
on bringing the boxes in

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.200
and so, initially you have
these benefits of specialization

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.940
and so, people can focus on
just one skill and do it well

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.040
but then you start getting
diminishing returns,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.870
the office starts getting crowded,

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.890
people are waiting for different supplies,

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.510
they have to get out of each other's way

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.140
and so, then you see this
diminishing return trend

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.770
where the marginal product
of labor starts going down

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.360
for those incremental labor units.

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.270
Next, we'll think about marginal cost

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.720
and as we'll see, the
marginal cost trend's going

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.270
the other direction as the
marginal product of labor.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.830
So, marginal cost is just for every,

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.800
for a certain increment and output,

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.530
how much is that costing us?

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.530
So, for example, if we are
going from 10 to 25 output,

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.460
for that 15 increment and output,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.900
how much is that costing us

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.520
and I would say costing us on average

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.600
but I don't want you to get confused,

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.310
we're not talking about
average variable cost

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.740
or average fixed cost
or average total cost

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.210
but that would be, let's see our costs

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.460
went from 7,000 to 11,000,

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.660
so we'll do 11,000 minus 7,000.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.590
That is our change in cost

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.940
divided by our change in total output.

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.910
So, that's going to be divided
by the 25 minus the 10.

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.170
And we could just scroll this down,

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.660
we'll extend that formula

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:13.990
and you can see this trend

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.290
that is as the marginal product of labor

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:19.710
is increasing, your
marginal cost is decreasing

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.290
and it makes sense, in
some ways we're getting

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.860
more efficient through the
specialization and what else

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.760
but then once you have
diminishing returns,

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.370
diminishing marginal returns,

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.690
your marginal cost is going up.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.890
And now we can do the,
I guess you could say

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.900
the average cost.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.410
So, first average of variable cost.

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.410
That's just taking your variable cost

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:42.590
and dividing it by your total output.

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.190
And so, for at least those first 25 units,

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:48.950
they cost on average or
just the variable component,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.380
you have to be careful is $240.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.280
If you talk about the fixed component,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.180
well, that's just gonna be our fixed cost

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:00.200
divided by our total units

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.025
and then our average total cost,

00:06:02.025 --> 00:06:04.380
that's gonna be our total cost

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.730
divided by those 25 units

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.930
and so, you can see,
our average total cost

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.780
for those first 25 units is $440

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.010
and then it can be broken up

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.870
between how much of that $440

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.820
is variable versus fixed

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.663
and then we can just
extend these formulas down,

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.260
the magic of spreadsheets

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.410
and what's interesting here

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.840
and it's not gonna be
going to be so obvious

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.690
just looking at this spreadsheet

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.180
is something interesting is happening

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.720
when marginal cost seems to intersect

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.630
either your average variable cost

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.800
or your average total cost

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.850
that at some point you're
average variable cost,

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:42.770
you see that same trend,

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:46.530
it's trending down and then
it starts to trend up again.

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.170
Average total cost is trending down

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.540
but then it trends up again

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.590
and as we'll see when we graph it,

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:55.330
the point at which
marginal cost intersects

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.300
with the average variable cost,

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.570
that's when you have
that change in direction

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.850
of average variable cost

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.817
and then same thing is true

00:07:02.817 --> 00:07:05.210
of when marginal cost intersects
with average total cost.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:08.100
That's when you have
that change in direction.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:10.500
Average fixed cost just continues

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.140
to go down because those fixed costs

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.200
aren't going up as you
have more and more output,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.930
so you have those same fixed costs,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.890
you could view it has spread
amongst more and more output,

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.070
so that's just going to
keep asymptoting downward.

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.030
In the next video, we'll
actually graph that

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.203
and see these trends visually.
