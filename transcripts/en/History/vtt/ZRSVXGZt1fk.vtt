00:00:00.934 --> 00:00:01.968
- What's upstairs?

00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:03.336
Some toys up there
when I was a kid.

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.804
FRANK FRITZ: Coming in!

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:05.905
Coming in hot.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.240
FRANK FRITZ: Coming in hot!
Coming in hot!

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:08.074
[interposing voices]

00:00:08.074 --> 00:00:09.109
All you had to do is say toys.

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:11.144
BRUCE: This is my
old room over here.

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.579
MIKE WOLFE: Yee-ha!
- Wow.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:13.680
Look at all these--

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:14.781
oh man!

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:15.849
MIKE WOLFE: Holy cow!
Man--

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:16.850
Super score!

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.084
MIKE WOLFE (VOICEOVER):
We get upstairs,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.086
and there is stuff everywhere.

00:00:20.086 --> 00:00:21.654
There's toys in boxes.

00:00:21.654 --> 00:00:22.956
I don't know which way to look.

00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:24.591
This was one of
my favorite games

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.892
when I was a kid, Spirograph.
- Spirograph.

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:26.826
Spirograph!

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:28.228
Oh my god, was
that my favorite.

00:00:28.228 --> 00:00:29.529
FRANK FRITZ (VOICEOVER):
I can remember

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.197
opening up my first
Spirograph for Christmas.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.065
I didn't know what it was.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:33.333
My grandma helped me.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:34.768
You put the pins in the gear.

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:36.636
You could put different
gears in, the big ones,

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:37.771
the small ones.

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:38.838
BRUCE: And that would
make a different design

00:00:38.838 --> 00:00:40.039
inside of the design.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.174
FRANK FRITZ: You could
make just about anything.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:42.842
Next thing you
know, I'm an artist.

00:00:42.842 --> 00:00:44.144
[interposing voices]
MIKE WOLFE: Oh, look at that!

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.211
FRANK FRITZ: It looks like
you never even played with.

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:46.112
BRUCE: Never played with.

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.113
Well, I played with that.

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:48.415
I evidently just
kept putting it back.

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:49.749
FRANK FRITZ: You kept
it in great shape.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.817
Man, that's very unusual--

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:51.384
FRANK FRITZ: I mean,
look at the designs.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.452
--for a boy.

00:00:52.452 --> 00:00:54.387
BRUCE: All the pieces
were still there.

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:57.090
I think that was something
that I learned from my dad

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.093
with tools, that once
you get a project done,

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.728
you put things away.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:05.465
So the next time you want to
use it, they're all still there.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:07.967
29 bucks.

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:08.768
Oh, what's this?

00:01:08.768 --> 00:01:09.803
FRANK FRITZ: Etch A Sketch.

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:10.804
You remember that toy?

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.872
Boy, man, did I
have the fun on this!

00:01:12.872 --> 00:01:14.474
MIKE WOLFE: I'm telling you.
- Some people were so good.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:15.341
MIKE WOLFE: Is it working?

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.643
Yeah, it's working.

00:01:16.643 --> 00:01:19.179
BRUCE: I remember playing
with that an awful lot, just

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.247
amazed at what
drawings and things

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.415
that you could come up with.

00:01:22.415 --> 00:01:24.784
Ohio Art made this.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.252
This was popular '70s.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.020
Yeah.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.154
It's in the original box.

00:01:28.154 --> 00:01:29.956
Some people were
so good at these.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:30.990
They used to have competitions.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.858
MIKE WOLFE: Look at that.

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:36.229
20 bucks.

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.363
I'll go with that.

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:38.097
Good deal.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.132
I love it.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.533
MIKE WOLFE: Look at that!
Spudsie!

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.202
- Yeah, you wind it up--
- I don't think I remember that.

00:01:42.202 --> 00:01:43.770
- --and you throw it around--
- It's like hot potato?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.938
It's like the hot potato.

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:46.272
BRUCE: There was
another one there.

00:01:46.272 --> 00:01:48.041
So you just toss it
until it friggin' blows up?

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.642
Yeah.
Till it blows up.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:54.714
There's still time.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:55.648
Yeah, it's still going.

00:01:55.648 --> 00:01:58.318
It usually needs
a little WD-40.

00:01:58.318 --> 00:01:59.686
[alarm rings]

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:00.920
Dude, you blew up!

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.622
MIKE WOLFE: Bruce played
with these things,

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.290
but then he learned
to put them away.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.825
$25.
- Good.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.126
- All right.
- All right.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:10.396
MIKE WOLFE: Look at that!
'63-'64 Corvette, SS Camaro.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:11.598
FRANK FRITZ: Yep!

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:12.966
MIKE WOLFE: Anything that
Chevrolet would have put

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.601
their name on-- oh
look at this, they even

00:02:14.601 --> 00:02:16.402
put Chevy on the racetrack.

00:02:16.402 --> 00:02:18.271
This actually had the
Chevy bow tie on it.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:21.441
You opened it up and it had the
Chevy dealership on the track.

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.510
"See the USA in your Chevrolet."

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.212
I can kind of
remember getting that,

00:02:26.212 --> 00:02:28.748
but I was getting a
little bit older in age.

00:02:28.748 --> 00:02:30.350
Who needed the toy cars?

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.552
I was actually driving
the real things.

00:02:32.552 --> 00:02:34.821
It was never even
played with, Bruce!

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:36.656
Man, your dad must have
had you really out there

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:37.991
friggin' working on
the farm, you never

00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.892
even played-- look at this!

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.093
FRANK FRITZ: Original batteries!

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:41.528
MIKE WOLFE: They're
not even screwed up!

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.062
$30.

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.665
You gotta go more on that.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:47.433
Give me a number.

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:50.270
$50 on that.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.638
$50.

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:53.106
I appreciate it.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.340
Holy cow, Bruce.

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.341
Wow!

00:02:55.341 --> 00:02:58.011
Man, you got the
cobwebs down here, whoa!

00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.647
[squealing] Look at this, whoa!

00:03:00.647 --> 00:03:02.415
FRANK FRITZ: There you go.
I'm set!

00:03:02.415 --> 00:03:03.683
Watch out-- ooh, yeah.

00:03:03.683 --> 00:03:05.518
Look, they got like little
circles in them, Frank.

00:03:05.518 --> 00:03:08.888
FRANK FRITZ: That is a
whole city right there, man.

00:03:08.888 --> 00:03:10.223
MIKE WOLFE: Yeah,
can you imagine

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:12.625
the spiders that are in here?

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.560
Made you a little space.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.594
MIKE WOLFE: What?

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.397
FRANK FRITZ: Made
you a little space.

00:03:17.397 --> 00:03:19.566
Aren't you thinking about
where are the spiders are?

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:20.500
Holy cow!

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.501
FRANK FRITZ: Yeah!
