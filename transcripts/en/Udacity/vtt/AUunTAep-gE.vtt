00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.184
What about your past? What about your ancestry information are you, are you most

00:00:06.184 --> 00:00:10.658
intrigued by, are you most interested in finding something out about? Hm, Ryan?

00:00:10.658 --> 00:00:14.290
&gt;&gt; I think for me, it's just to see know

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.430
what different cultures or what different ethnic groups I spring

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.570
from, because the Philippines have been conquered by Spain, and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890
Spain ruled there for Four hundred years, and then the Japanese

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.900
invaded for a while, and then we were also part of

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.620
the United States for a while, and so just finding out

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.200
what different ethnic groups, what kind of, what kind of genetics

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.114
I have, in terms of where does my gene pool come from.

00:00:38.114 --> 00:00:38.302
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:38.302 --> 00:00:43.952
&gt;&gt; It's really, that's kind of in terms of the past for me and

00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:48.106
so. The neanderthal thing is pretty cool too. Just kind of a interesting fact

00:00:48.106 --> 00:00:48.528
[LAUGH].

00:00:48.528 --> 00:00:49.718
&gt;&gt; It's not going to, it's not going to change

00:00:49.718 --> 00:00:50.033
[CROSSTALK]

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:50.920
your, your identity at all?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.300
&gt;&gt; No, it's just kind of of a thing, I just like, you know,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.574
any, if I knew anyone who has it, oh, what's your percentage of neanderthal?

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:57.574
&gt;&gt;

00:00:56.574 --> 00:00:57.162
[LAUGH].

00:00:57.162 --> 00:00:57.994
[CROSSTALK].

00:00:57.994 --> 00:00:58.400
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.450
&gt;&gt; Cock, cocktail party conversation.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.450
&gt;&gt;

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.141
[LAUGH].

00:01:02.141 --> 00:01:04.160
&gt;&gt; Does it change your identity at all? If

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.540
you find this information Oh, I am going to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.390
kagure and lets say you mentioned that you know

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.500
your mother is lighter skinned and may be is a

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.560
European and you know and my background is somewhere,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.500
does that change any thing for how do you think

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.030
about yourself your family and, and how does it

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.320
impact that you are most interested in finding out about.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.150
&gt;&gt; I think the change is what I

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.870
think about my family historically, in terms of what

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.780
happened at the time in the country, and where my ancestors were in order to

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.870
interact with people from another continent. I don't

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.690
think it changes how I think about my

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.450
grandmother, or each one of them as individuals. It just helps me build a story

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.860
as to where my people came from and that's what I would be most interested in.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.160
&gt;&gt; So it's a more like sort of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.670
completing a patchwork of, you know, your past and.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.991
&gt;&gt; I, yes but, I mean, I could make it up but it's

00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:57.504
[LAUGH].

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.504
&gt;&gt;

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.018
[LAUGH].

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.308
&gt;&gt; And I'd be very happy with that because clearly

00:02:00.308 --> 00:02:02.883
it's not something that will change how I live my life.

00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:03.226
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:08.710
&gt;&gt; It's more about The curiosity behind knowing where I came from with

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.750
almost, with more certainty than my made-up story in my head.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.980
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt;

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.720
[CROSSTALK]

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.230
[NOISE]

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.590
So.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.420
&gt;&gt; What about you, Sterling? Someone who, you know,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.520
it doesn't, isn't familiar with their specific biological background?

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.870
&gt;&gt; I think for the, the deep historical part, the ancestry its

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.020
more of a curiosity I mean I can hypothesize you know, that I'm probably from

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.360
some mass up of European countries but it'll be interesting to know like

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.570
if there's specific ones that. More of my Genetics the great percentage of my

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.990
Genetics comes from So, that's start more a curiosity

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.835
but obliviously the biological relatives will have the more of an

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:59.730
impact and probably change, could change a few things in my life.
