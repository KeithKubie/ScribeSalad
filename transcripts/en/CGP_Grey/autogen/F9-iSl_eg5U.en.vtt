00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.100
 8) Let's talk about Lemmings 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.450
 When you hear the word "lemmings" you probably think of two things: 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.280
 This game, and some small animal that commits suicide by jumping off a cliff 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.089
 if the population becomes too large. 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.070
 For if you didn't know it yet, lemmings are real, cute and not suicidal. 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.160
 The origin of this myth is a bit unclear but the video game probably has a lot of young people 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.059
 convinced that lemmings conscientiously commit suicide - and enormously 

00:00:23.059 --> 00:00:25.520
 frustrating to be micro-manageable and therefore deserving of mass eradication. 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.480
 7) Daddly Longlegs 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.259
 These wispy-looking things have the reputation of being the most poisonous of all spiders. 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.910
 But they are also very common, so you might wonder why no more people die 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.520
 Daddy-Longleg bites every year. 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.150
 Like a good conspiracy, this myth hides its own traces by saying that 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.530
 their canines are too small to pierce human skin. 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430
 You could count a point on team people except that this misconception has a triple blow 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.160
 of error is: 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.110
 1) Daddy Longlegs have no fangs 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.600
 2) They do not produce poison 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.329
 3) They are not even spiders 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:51.010
 6) Ostriches 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.180
 Let's take a look at the characteristics of these non-flying birds 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.130
 They are up to 2.74 meters long, up to 154 kilos, aggressive, and have sharp beaks 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.840
 long claws. 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.940
 In fact, the ostrich is the most similar to a living velociraptor that you 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.250
 ever see. 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.780
 (At least until our genetic manupilation technologies get better, come on Dinoapocalypse!). 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.110
 Anyway, with these facts in mind, if you decide to threaten an ostrich 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.460
 Do you really think he will stick his head in the sand and wait to die? 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.069
 No, of course not, if you're lucky he would run away at 64 k / m, and if not 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.499
 then it's deadly accident time for you. 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:20.420
 Ostriches have no reason to hide and certainly not in the stupidest way ever. 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.409
 If they did, they would have survived as long as a certain other species of non-flying bird. 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 Speaking of non-flying birds, 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.560
 5) Baby Birds 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.639
 A mother bird would leave her baby as soon as you touch it, as one 

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:32.090
 human mother would abandon her baby if a bird touched it. 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.340
 If you find a bird, and you can reach the nest, it is really good to see the beast 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.069
 to stop back. 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:37.630
 4) Goldfish memory 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.009
 Goldfish have a memory longer than 3 or 7 seconds or 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.060
 no matter how long people say. 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.679
 In fact, they can be trained and will remember for months. What's more 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.090
 then what can be said of some people. 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.979
 By the way, goldfish are also delicious. 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.240
 3) Dog view 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.450
 Poor dogs, living in their pathetic, monochrome world. 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.749
 Except that is not the case. Dogs see colors but not in our way. 

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.919
 Most people see 3 primary colors, red, blue and green, but dogs only see 2: 

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:05.240
 They can see blue, but they cannot distinguish the rest of the color spectrum. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.149
 What they don't care until you buy a red toy for them and throw it in the green grass, 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.140
 and then finds them stupid because they can't find it. 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.590
 It is easy for you because your ancestors have spent millions of years picking 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.790
 of red objects against a green background and are therefore quite good at it. Unless they don't 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.230
 they could and they would die - but dog eyes are not monkey eyes and for your dog 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.769
 holds, if it's not blue, it's all the same. 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.290
 So next time in the pet store, get a blue toy for Rover. 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.360
 And when we talk about watching, let's talk about: 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.709
 2) Bats 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.510
 Which, if you have looked at them, it should be immediately clear that they are not blind 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.459
 are because they look at you - with their eyes - that they use to. 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.049
 see. 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.060
 They do have something better with an extra sense called echolocation for it 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.469
 ensures that they can see in the dark, something that you cannot. 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:43.090
 So from the perspective of a bat you are blind. 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.849
 1) You can cook a frog to death if you do it very slowly. 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.769
 This is true ... sort of. 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.920
 Friedrich Goltz, demonstrated that a frog will happily sit in a boiling pot 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.409
 water as long as the temperature rises slowly enough. 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:57.780
 However, 1 of the striking facts is often forgotten in the Goltz story 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.530
 namely that he took their brains out before he put them in the pot. 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.159
 Which gives the frog a disadvantage. 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.530
 Goltz also showed that if you don't lobotomize the frog first (brain out) he will 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.530
 then just stand out. 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.140
 It seems logical - but do not try this at home - that removing the brain from which animal 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.260
 therefore, survival instances are properly prevented. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.599
 And it makes them more sensitive to common misconceptions
