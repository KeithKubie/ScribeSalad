00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:00.840
Hi there, everyone.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.510
I'm Brady, and I make the
Numberphile videos.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.830
And this is a bit of a
supplementary video for our

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:08.070
one about Benford's Law.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.700
Now hopefully you've already
watched that, and you know

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.220
what Benford's Law is.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.480
But just a reminder, everything
we're talking about

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.610
here pertains to the
first digit of

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.260
all these big numbers.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.720
So let's get into it.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.800
What we've done is an analysis
of the statistics of

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.740
Numberphile videos to find out
whether or not they're

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.660
following Benford's Law.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.600
Now I'd love to say I did
this myself, but it's a

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.110
bit beyond my skills.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.470
I was helped by a very clever
man named Daniel, so

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.270
thank you to him.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.850
So what I've done is I've given
Daniel the duration of

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.480
every Numberphile video in
seconds, the number of times

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.400
it's been viewed, and the number
of comments that have

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.580
been made on each video.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.250
So what he's done is he's looked
at the first digit of

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.710
all those numbers and plotted
them on a graph, finding out

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.180
what digit is most commonly at
the start of the number.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.500
And here's the graph.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.380
Now let's look at these
one by one.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.650
First of all, there's
the durations.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.360
And for those of you who
remember what a good Benford

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.030
curve looks like, well,
it looks like this.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.110
So we haven't got a
very good match.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.060
Let's look at the view counts.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.870
Now, number one is definitely
the most common digit at the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.780
start of the view counts,
followed by number two.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.410
That's as it should be.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.200
But it goes a bit wrong there
at the end, doesn't it?

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.790
Let's try the number
of comments on

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.480
each Numberphile video.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.550
Again, number four seems to come
up more than you would

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.430
have expected.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.350
Number one is still the
top, but I don't know.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.670
It's not quite Benford-esque,
is it?

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.870
So the Numberphile statistics
don't seem to quite be

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.850
following the way we hoped.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.270
Maybe that's because it's not
a big enough sample size.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.570
We've only done just over
100 Numberphile videos.

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.580
But for those of you who are
familiar with my other

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.280
channels, yes, I do have quite a
few other channels, so those

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.200
of you who are familiar with
those other channels might be

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.400
aware that I've made, well,
well over 1,000 videos on

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.430
YouTube now.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.270
That's a bigger sample size.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.690
So I sent the statistics for
all those videos to Daniel,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.290
and he did the same thing.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.780
Let's find out what
happened there.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.710
So these are the steps
for all my channels.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.420
And let's go through
them one by one.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.450
First of all, the durations.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.780
There we go.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.580
Not Benford-esque, is it?

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.480
In fact, number one's
not even top.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.390
Number three is the most
common first digit.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.230
Now, we've had a bit of a talk
about this, and we've got a

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.960
few theories as to why the
durations aren't working.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.000
But rather than putting them
here in the video, I thought

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.630
it might be more fun for you
to think about it, propose

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.780
what you think's going
on, and put them in

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.530
comments under the video.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.040
There's also a blog where we've
gone into it, and again,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.340
there will be links under the
video in the full description,

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.510
so have a look at that.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.210
But enough about durations.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.210
Let's look at the view counts,
and the number of comments.

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.850
Plotting the view counts on all
my videos, the most common

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.330
first digit is 1, followed
by 2, followed by 3,

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.700
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.980
And the curve?

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.240
Well, quite Benford-esque.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.120
Not bad, eh?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.010
And looking at the number of
comments, again, remember this

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.250
is the first digit
in these numbers.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.470
Have a look at that.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.110
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.200
Again, a lovely Benford
curve there.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.400
So it looks like even the
YouTube viewing statistics and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.510
the number of comments are
following a Benford curve.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.470
Now as I said, more
information,

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.780
links under the video.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.810
Thank you to Daniel for
helping me out.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.950
Thank you for all the other
people who volunteered to help

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.270
me out when I put out
the plea for help.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.160
And we'll have more
videos soon.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.460
And leave a comment
under this one.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.180
Let's see if we can get this
one outside the curve.
