up of your own accord you know so if
you're a student and you're taking

you're a student and you're taking
 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.149
you're a student and you're taking

yourself well I need to sit down and

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
yourself well I need to sit down and
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.050
yourself well I need to sit down and
study for three hours but then you sit

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
study for three hours but then you sit
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.789
study for three hours but then you sit
down and that is what happens your

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
down and that is what happens your
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.710
down and that is what happens your
attention goes everywhere and you might

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720
attention goes everywhere and you might
 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.230
attention goes everywhere and you might
say well whose attention is it then if

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
say well whose attention is it then if
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.179
say well whose attention is it then if
it goes everywhere because you say it's

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189
it goes everywhere because you say it's
 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.429
it goes everywhere because you say it's
your attention it's like well if it's

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
your attention it's like well if it's
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.840
your attention it's like well if it's
your attention maybe you'd be able to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850
your attention maybe you'd be able to
 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300
your attention maybe you'd be able to
control it but you can't and so then you

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
control it but you can't and so then you
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.620
control it but you can't and so then you
might think well Jen and just exactly

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630
might think well Jen and just exactly
 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.230
might think well Jen and just exactly
what the hell is controlling it and you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240
what the hell is controlling it and you
 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.760
what the hell is controlling it and you
might say well it's random it's the well

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770
might say well it's random it's the well
 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.800
might say well it's random it's the well
it better not be random I can tell you

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810
it better not be random I can tell you
 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870
it better not be random I can tell you
that that's that happens to some degree

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880
that that's that happens to some degree
 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429
that that's that happens to some degree
in schizophrenia there's an element of

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439
in schizophrenia there's an element of
 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.710
in schizophrenia there's an element of
randomness and that it's not random

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720
randomness and that it's not random
 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.490
randomness and that it's not random
it's driven by the action of phenomena

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
it's driven by the action of phenomena
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.469
it's driven by the action of phenomena
that I think are best considered as

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
that I think are best considered as
 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510
that I think are best considered as
something like subpersonalities although

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
something like subpersonalities although
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.770
something like subpersonalities although
even that's only a partial description

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
even that's only a partial description
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.359
even that's only a partial description
you can't make yourself interested in

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
you can't make yourself interested in
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.740
you can't make yourself interested in
something interest manifests itself and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750
something interest manifests itself and
 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.319
something interest manifests itself and
grips you that's a whole different thing

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329
grips you that's a whole different thing
 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.289
grips you that's a whole different thing
and so what is it that's gripping you

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
and so what is it that's gripping you
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.420
and so what is it that's gripping you
and how do you conceptualize that is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430
and how do you conceptualize that is
 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.590
and how do you conceptualize that is
that a divine power

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
that a divine power
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.059
that a divine power
well it's divine as far as you're

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069
well it's divine as far as you're
 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.070
well it's divine as far as you're
concerned because it grips you and you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080
concerned because it grips you and you
 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.979
concerned because it grips you and you
can't do anything about it and so

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989
can't do anything about it and so
 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.300
can't do anything about it and so
there's a

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310
there's a
 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.740
there's a
falling in you towards what you're

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750
falling in you towards what you're
 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.210
falling in you towards what you're
compelled by and what you're interested

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220
compelled by and what you're interested
 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.710
compelled by and what you're interested
in is sometimes that might be very dark

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720
in is sometimes that might be very dark
 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.800
in is sometimes that might be very dark
and sometimes not but you're compelled

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810
and sometimes not but you're compelled
 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.960
and sometimes not but you're compelled
forward by your interest and so and so

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
forward by your interest and so and so
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.360
forward by your interest and so and so
the idea that what moves you away from

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370
the idea that what moves you away from
 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.130
the idea that what moves you away from
your country in your father's house and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140
your country in your father's house and
 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.960
your country in your father's house and
the comforts of your child at home is is

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970
the comforts of your child at home is is
 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.059
the comforts of your child at home is is
something that's beyond you and that you

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069
something that's beyond you and that you
 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.640
something that's beyond you and that you
listen to and hearken to that's exactly

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650
listen to and hearken to that's exactly
 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.350
listen to and hearken to that's exactly
right and you can say well I don't want

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360
right and you can say well I don't want
 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.720
