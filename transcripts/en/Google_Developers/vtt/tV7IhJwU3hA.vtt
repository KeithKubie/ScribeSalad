JOANNA SMITH: Hi everybody,
happy Halloween!

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.450
I'm Joanna Smith and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:23.740
here at Google.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.830
And today I have Gus
Class with me.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.880
GUS CLASS: Hi, I'm Gus Class.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.460
I'm a developer advocate
on Google+.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.310
JOANNA SMITH: And we're both
really excited because today

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.190
we are actually going to
showcase some of our favorite

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.690
apps from the community.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.620
And so I guess let's go ahead
and do some introductions and

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.190
see who we've got here
with us today.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.380
ABRAHAM: I'm in tech start up,
and if you've been on the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.520
Google group you've probably
seen some posts from

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.370
me or run into me.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.030
So yeah, that's me.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.760
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: Hi there,
I'm Allen Firstenberg.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.950
I'm located in New York.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.800
I've contributed to the Hangout
Comment Tracker, I've

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.360
done some work with the caption
app and a couple of

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.880
other small utility apps.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.790
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Hi there, I'm
RobotGrrl and these are my

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.040
robots, RoboBrrd, and recently
I made a Google+ Hangout

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.758
extension for them
to [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.330
GERWIN STURM: Hi, I'm
Gerwin from Austria.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.390
You probably know me from
tools like [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.360
plus statistics or the Comment
Tracker and I'm always up to

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.380
do some fun stuff.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.340
So I only just started
a project last

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.590
night, so you'll see.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.210
JOANNA SMITH: Moritz,
we can't hear you.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.870
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Sorry.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:55.760
I'm Moritz.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.860
I'm Moritz Tolxdorff from
Germany, and I started playing

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.520
with the Hangouts API and my
first app was the Hangout

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.720
Lower Third, and some people
might know this app.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.889
And I recently combined all my
apps in the Hangout Toolbox

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:12.420
and also included Gerwin's
Comment Tracker, which is a

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.655
great addition to the Toolbox.

00:02:15.655 --> 00:02:16.940
GUS CLASS: It looks like
you're replacing your

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.890
background there too.

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.790
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah, but
that's not a Hangout app.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.240
Unfortunately.

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.220
JOANNA SMITH: Well,
we like it.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.800
GUS CLASS: We like it.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.600
JOANNA SMITH: So Gus and
I are really excited.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.790
It seems like we've got some
really awesome people here,

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.580
and I hope that everyone
watching really enjoys

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.660
learning from them as well.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.070
And I think we're just going
to jump into our demos,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.100
beginning with Erin RobotGrrl.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.790
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: So the demo of
this is basically, there's

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.760
this web app slash Google+
Hangout extension with buttons

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.180
on it that list out
various fruits.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.420
And then you touch the
button and then it

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.685
can feed the RoboBrrds.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:02.310
And then you can see
the reaction here.

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:15.066
[INAUDIBLE].

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.090
JOANNA SMITH: Now, Erin, you
posted a link where viewers

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.210
can actually play with the
RoboBrrds themselves, right?

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.240
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Yep.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.640
[INAUDIBLE]

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.390
tinyurl.com/robobrrdfeeder.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.910
And then you can feed
them as well.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:39.280
And it's pretty hungry,
so please feed it.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.820
JOANNA SMITH: That's
really cool.

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.850
So what inspired this
app in particular?

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.690
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: In particular,
well, I have a

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.880
robot party each week.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.370
And I created one before that
that worked with a robot with

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.260
tank treads on it.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.295
And it was cool to drive her
around everywhere, but I

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:04.720
didn't have it for my RoboBrrds
yet, so I wanted to

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.370
make that for RoboBrrding.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.140
Actually, the root of the
inspiration for the tank tread

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.560
robot was the Oscar robot, which
Gus created with the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.070
Google+ Hangout stuff as well.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:21.180
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.710
So you took a similar approach
where you had a web server

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.230
running, and then that's
connected to Arduino, and then

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.000
so you actually trigger the some
sort of routine on the

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.462
Arduino through a web page.

00:04:34.462 --> 00:04:36.180
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Yep, exactly.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.750
The way I have it set up is a
little bit different than

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.940
yours, but the same
general idea.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:48.790
I have it on an EC2 instance
running like a node.js app,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.100
which is this web app
thing that you see

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.400
on the screen there.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.360
And then that's sending out the
data through a TCP socket,

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.050
and then I have a processing
sketch that's listening to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.560
that socket, and then it
sends that data to

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.810
the Arduino via serial.

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.820
And then the robot listens,
and then it just does

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.620
something based off of that.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.450
GUS CLASS: That's awesome.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:16.700
JOANNA SMITH: That's so cool.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.940
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: One thing that
I was really surprised about

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:25.890
was that there isn't that much
lag, so it's really cool to

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:29.220
see its really instant
when you press

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.300
it and then it reacts.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.740
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that's
definitely a great advantage

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.760
of using the web
sockets, right?

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.080
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Yeah.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.280
GUS CLASS: Yeah, awesome.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.730
JOANNA SMITH: I like also that
you just were able to

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.590
basically steal from Gus, like
the Oscar the Hangout robot.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:46.230
That's really cool.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.270
We love to see people take
ideas and run with them.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.570
GUS CLASS: Yeah,
reuse is good.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:55.630
All right, so, do you
have any questions

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.490
for us or any feedback?

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.680
Any things you learned or any
big challenges that you had

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.070
when you were working with
us, or was it pretty

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.230
straightforward?

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.750
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Well, there was
one time when I was trying

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:13.310
to add in Google Analytics to,
I think, the Hangout XML and

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.270
then it didn't work and I
couldn't figure out why.

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:20.340
And then I just had to remove
everything and try everything

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.683
again, so that was
a little weird.

00:06:22.683 --> 00:06:24.570
I don't know why
that happened.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.740
JOANNA SMITH: Did you file a bug
in our issue tracker when

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:34.740
you encountered that?

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.145
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: No, because I
wasn't sure if it was an issue

00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:40.010
with bugs, I was thinking
it was probably mine.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.776
JOANNA SMITH: It might have been
yours, but I think it's

00:06:41.776 --> 00:06:44.310
always worth filing those bugs
because if nothing else I'll

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.380
at least promise to read it, and
then we'll see if we can

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.566
reproduce it on our end.

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:50.030
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: OK.

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:52.400
Cool.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.500
JOANNA SMITH: Anything else?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.140
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Actually, the
first web app that I've

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:59.120
created, so eventually
I want to add in

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.050
more Hangout API stuff.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.995
So that maybe I could get a
robot to say whoever's in the

00:07:06.995 --> 00:07:10.790
Hangout out loud using text
to speech or something.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.390
GUS CLASS: That could
be really awesome.

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.280
JOANNA SMITH: That
would be so fun.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.640
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Yeah.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:17.220
So I'm slowly learning all
this web app stuff.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:17.910
JOANNA SMITH: OK, great, yeah.

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.690
And as you're learning if you
think of questions, just send

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:23.830
them to be on Google+
and we'll definitely

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:24.720
try to help you out.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.140
And there's always our forum.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.220
And then any really good
questions we'll just mention

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:32.420
on our next Office Hours for
other people to learn too.

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.540
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Cool.

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.790
JOANNA SMITH: Cool.

00:07:38.341 --> 00:07:39.832
They really are hungry.

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:49.640
GUS CLASS: So up next
we'll have--

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.535
JOANNA SMITH: We'll
have Gerwin next.

00:07:50.535 --> 00:07:51.785
GUS CLASS: We'll have Gerwin.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.360
GERWIN STURM: Last night I got
this great idea that I want to

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:00.220
add a Rubik's cube to Hangout
so that people can play with

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.670
their Rubik's Cube together.

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:04.040
So, I only started a little bit
of hacking today, so I'm

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.370
just going to screen share
what I have so far.

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.370
It's not in the Hangout yet.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:10.430
It's a cube.

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:11.920
See?

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.720
It's a cube, and you can
actually spin it around.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.310
And so what I'm really proud of,
this is all just CSS and

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.290
JavaScript and HTML5, so no
Flash, no nothing, and

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.210
you can play it.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:29.760
GUS CLASS: Awesome.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.320
GERWIN STURM: So you can
actually solve it already if

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.570
you know how to.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:37.830
So this will run, so actually
this can already run in the

00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:40.030
Hangout, but it doesn't make a
difference because it's not

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.355
sharing this state yet.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:44.450
So what I'm planning to do is
adding a shared state so

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.840
everybody will see the same
cube, but they can still

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.340
orient the cube like
they want to.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.690
Everybody can look on from
their own direction.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.100
And then if somebody moves, this
will be shared with all

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:53.810
the others.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.000
So what I'm not quite sure yet
is how this will work if two

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.870
people click at the same time,
which might be a problem.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.180
So I'm not quite sure how I'm
going to solve it from a

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.520
technical side, but what I'm
thinking is that I will have

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.990
the shared state to always
represent the full cube.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:14.170
And then I'm going to send out
quick messages, with the sent

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:18.870
message, just to say, OK, this
person rotated the top layer,

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:20.400
for example.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.570
So that everybody can see the
movement, and then when the

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:25.420
shared state comes.

00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:28.580
So the shared state will always
have a well-lit cube in

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:30.340
it, at least.

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:30.610
JOANNA SMITH: That's cool.

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:33.910
Are you going to add maybe the
ability to have multiple cubes

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.213
so that people can race each
other or something?

00:09:36.213 --> 00:09:37.897
GERWIN STURM: Yeah,
that would work.

00:09:37.897 --> 00:09:39.580
Maybe.

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.460
JOANNA SMITH: That's something
that I would definitely do.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:43.530
I'm not competitive,
don't worry.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:45.040
GUS CLASS: Yeah, there's kind
of an interesting challenge

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.450
there, where it's kind of like,
what prevents two people

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.250
from making moves at
the same time?

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.190
And so you can do a turn taking
sort of approach.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.870
Have you thought of that?

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.070
GERWIN STURM: That's what it was
one of my thoughts to let

00:10:01.070 --> 00:10:02.600
people have.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.360
JOANNA SMITH: Hold on,
it just came to our

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.430
attention that we had--

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.006
[INAUDIBLE]

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.510
GUS CLASS: All right,
we're back.

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.760
Magically.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.510
All right, so we'll start
where we left off.

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:19.700
Gerwin, you were showing
us your Rubik's cube.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.480
OK, I can see it.

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:25.070
And so, you can move
the cube around.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.530
GERWIN STURM: And the easiest
way to solve it is just to

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:31.780
refresh the page.

00:10:34.084 --> 00:10:37.330
GUS CLASS: That's the fastest
Rubik's cube solve ever.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.630
ABRAHAM: If only life
was more like that.

00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:41.317
JOANNA SMITH: You can solve it
in a minute, well I can solve

00:10:41.317 --> 00:10:43.240
it in a click.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.500
GERWIN STURM: Actually because
this is all just HTML and CSS,

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:49.910
you can actually just go into
the Inspector and change the

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.020
colors like you would change
the stickers around.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.790
So you can do all the cheating
then as well in the Hangout.

00:10:58.790 --> 00:10:59.660
JOANNA SMITH: Good,
yeah, we want to

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.910
encourage proper cheating.

00:11:03.368 --> 00:11:06.510
It's not real world
without that.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.630
GERWIN STURM: And just
wait, I have--

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.880
I'm just going to show you.

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.950
So that's why.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.610
I'm just combining
things I love.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.930
So I love the Hangout API
and love Rubik's cubes.

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:22.500
GUS CLASS: There you go.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.630
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: So you were
just sitting there looking for

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:28.260
some inspiration and it just
sort of came to you?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.044
GERWIN STURM: Popped
into my face.

00:11:31.044 --> 00:11:32.800
GUS CLASS: That's awesome.

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.760
GERWIN STURM: And actually,
Allen, your work on your game,

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.000
when we started, we talked
a little bit about CSS

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.710
transforms.

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.450
That's how I got the idea, wait
maybe I'll do a Rubik's

00:11:43.450 --> 00:11:44.700
cube just in CSS.

00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.810
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: I was
wondering if that inspired it

00:11:49.810 --> 00:11:50.470
in any way.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:54.870
At one point I was working on
a 3D tic-tac-toe game, and

00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:59.150
Gerwin suggested that I look
into 3D transformations to see

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.790
if I could represent the boards
using that, and I did

00:12:02.790 --> 00:12:04.400
some work on it.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.750
GUS CLASS: That's awesome.

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.520
I think it looks great.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.820
I like how they're kind
of translucent, too.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:12.100
GERWIN STURM: I thought it was
fun to just make it a little

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.150
bit more special somehow.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.880
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that's
real fun.

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:15.900
I can't wait to play
with it once

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:16.990
you've got into a Hangout.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.350
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah you're going
to kill mine and Gus's

00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:20.102
productivity so hard.

00:12:22.988 --> 00:12:27.550
All right, so let's go ahead and
see what Moritz brought.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.350
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah, as I
said earlier, that I combined

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.380
all my tools in the
Hangout Toolbox.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.900
I want to show you this
app real quick.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.520
I hope it's readable
on the screen.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.650
It might be a bit pixelated.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.320
But this is my Hangout Toolbox,
and I basically took

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.620
all my apps I released so far
and combined them in one app,

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.240
because there was an issue that
you're not able to load

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.210
multiple apps as an extension
at the same time.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.630
They replace each other once
you load an extension.

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:04.990
So, for example, if I would load
up Google Effects right

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:09.240
now, my Hangout Toolbox
would be gone.

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.260
And I heard from a lot of people
that they use Hangout

00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.930
Lower Third and Volume Control
and Comment Tracker and

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:18.440
Hangouts On Air, and you weren't
able to run them

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:20.060
simultaneously at
the same time.

00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:23.420
So I had to resolve this problem
on my own until Google

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:26.300
maybe someday releases something
new that you can run

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.270
multiple apps at
the same time.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:33.120
So I had this idea to combine
all these apps in one big app.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:36.260
And this is what I basically
did, so you have the Hangout

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.510
Lower Third part where
you can select all

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:40.490
your Lower Third stuff.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:44.110
You can select your own color
in the recent version.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:49.520
So that's also the point that
I'm not updating my current or

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.050
my original Lower Third app
anymore, I'm only maintaining

00:13:53.050 --> 00:13:55.510
the Lower Third part in
the Hangout Toolbox.

00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:58.070
If users want to have the latest
Lower Third app, they

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:59.320
should use the Hangout
Toolbox.

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.030
You can also select your country
flag and display that

00:14:06.030 --> 00:14:08.010
as an icon within your
Lower Third.

00:14:08.010 --> 00:14:10.510
You have the Volume Control,
where you can adjust the

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:13.430
volume for each participant
in the Hangout.

00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:17.585
If there's some user who has a
very loud microphone or is a

00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:20.500
bit silent, you can just
tune it up or down.

00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.830
Or you can even mute them
completely, or the whole

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.740
Hangout if you get a phone
call or whatever.

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:27.460
It's some sort of emergency
button.

00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.495
You can just click it and the
whole Hangout gets muted, and

00:14:30.495 --> 00:14:33.140
your microphone gets muted as
well, so you can watch a video

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:35.710
and get on the phone
or whatever.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:38.430
And then jump back
into the Hangout.

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.450
And then you have the meme face
part, where you have some

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:46.890
funny meme faces you can put
on your face, like this.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.590
I'm not sure if it's
working right now.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.550
No, it's not detecting
my face.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:55.830
It's like face tracking
overlay.

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.130
Abraham is using the Google
Effects app right now with the

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:00.920
hats and stuff.

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:01.590
ABRAHAM: No.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.520
This is how I look every day.

00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:09.310
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: This is
basically the same API method

00:15:09.310 --> 00:15:10.580
I'm using here.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.910
And you can also put in a URL
for your own face you want to

00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:14.460
put in there.

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:17.960
And then the sound board is
also part of the Google

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.340
Effects, I just extended
it a little bit more

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:21.850
from some more sounds.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.160
Or some Pacman sounds
or whatever.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:32.340
And yeah, the most recent
addition is the Comment

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:34.940
Tracker, which Gerwin
developed.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.380
Which is very useful, especially
in Hangouts On Air,

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.250
where you have the YouTube
comments and the comments on

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.970
Google+ and maybe
also on Twitter.

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:46.210
And you can combine all those
sources into one stream within

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.060
the Hangout so you don't have to
click through tabs and try

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.590
to aggregate all the
different comments

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.600
from different sources.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.250
You have everything
in one stream.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:16:01.200
And it also scans the re-shares
of Google+ posts so

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.550
you don't have to find
those re-shares.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.570
The app does it for you.

00:16:05.570 --> 00:16:09.640
And once you have all the
sources set up, you can also

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.400
share the sources with other
participants running the app,

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.400
so they can follow the
stream as well.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:21.380
So if I put in, for example,
the URL from this Hangout

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.590
here, it shows me here the
Hangout, and there's also

00:16:25.590 --> 00:16:27.900
already one comment.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.430
And I can also click on View and
then it will display the

00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:34.990
comment on screen so people
in the Hangout On Air can

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.880
actually read the comment.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:37.360
GUS CLASS: Oh, that's cool.

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.700
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: So this is
a really cool app Gerwin

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.100
developed there.

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.670
And combining that with Lower
Third and all the other stuff

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:46.270
is really a valuable tool
for Hangouts On Air.

00:16:46.270 --> 00:16:47.050
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that's
really fun.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.780
So it looks like you're kind
of using the whole

00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.060
breadth of the APIs.

00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:54.780
Are there any specific
highlights you may want to

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.580
call out here?

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.920
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Well, most of
it is just the Hangout API.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:06.040
Plus a bit of the Google+ API
as well, and the Common

00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.930
Tracker, the YouTube API.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:11.530
And Gerwin, correct me if I'm
wrong, but are there any other

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.170
API's you're using in the
Comment Tracker so far?

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:14.819
GERWIN STURM: The Twitter API.

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.690
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Oh, yeah,
the Twitter API.

00:17:17.690 --> 00:17:19.369
GERWIN STURM: Not the Google.

00:17:19.369 --> 00:17:21.359
JOANNA SMITH: You were talking
about how your main motivation

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.489
was to be able to aggregate all
of the different apps that

00:17:23.489 --> 00:17:25.190
you wanted to use into one.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:27.839
Did you find that difficult to
do, or was it actually fairly

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.630
straightforward once you
had each app developed?

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:33.120
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: It was
surprisingly easy.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.530
I had all the single apps and
once I had the idea and

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:39.040
started on this [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:43.640
I just loaded in every single
JavaScript file from all my

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.850
apps, and it just worked.

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:47.340
I was really surprised.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:50.160
I didn't have to do many
customizations or

00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.730
modifications to my basic apps,
they were just included

00:17:53.730 --> 00:17:55.740
in the overall app and
it was just working.

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.080
So it was really
easy to build.

00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.430
JOANNA SMITH: That's really
encouraging hear.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:01.960
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that's great.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.030
JOANNA SMITH: So I'm going to
go ahead and mention this,

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:07.070
anybody who's watching who has
questions for our developers

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:10.470
or for Gus and I. Go ahead and
make a comment on either the

00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:13.195
Google+ event or on the YouTube
live stream, and that

00:18:13.195 --> 00:18:14.670
way we can address
your questions.

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:16.520
But I think from here on out
we're all just going to sit

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.950
around and chat about the APIs
and about developing for a

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:23.590
little while while we wait for
those questions to roll in.

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.245
So back to you, Moritz, and
whatever you were saying.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.410
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: One of the
things that I wanted to bring

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:34.670
up is that a lot of the stuff
that Moritz has done has been

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:38.980
really to help out people who
are doing Hangouts On Air or

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:41.620
people who are producing
Hangouts.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:45.210
And we see a lot of people who
will often come to us and say,

00:18:45.210 --> 00:18:49.510
hey can you do this, or I'm
encountering this problem with

00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:50.950
the Hangout, is there
something that

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:52.690
you guys can do?

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:56.820
I got a question a month or so
back with someone saying, I'm

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:02.720
using Hangouts On Air to
place a phone call.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.220
And while that feature works
really well, sometimes I'll

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.320
place a phone call and then I
need to enter an extension.

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.190
And they asked if there was a
way that they could then touch

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:12.030
tone in another extension.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:20.680
So I cooked up a quick app that
would let you do your own

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:22.550
touch tones as part of it.

00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.970
And that's something that I'm
looking to extend a little to

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:27.740
make it easier if you're
frequently calling extensions

00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:30.420
or frequently doing this
sorts of thing.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:32.270
But those are the sorts of
things that we can do, and I

00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:38.120
think that's the power behind
the Hangout API.

00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:38.900
JOANNA SMITH: That's a
really good point.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.355
That's awesome.

00:19:40.355 --> 00:19:43.395
GUS CLASS: If you can dream it,
you can build it, right?

00:19:43.395 --> 00:19:45.380
Or if somebody wants it you
can usually solve their

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.490
problem too.

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:49.250
ABRAHAM: And if you can build
it, you can charge for it.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:57.350
I was actually surprised by how
Gerwin could say, here is

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.860
the Rubik's Cube, and if you
can't solve it then you can

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:03.144
use in-app payments and pay
me a dollar and I'll

00:20:03.144 --> 00:20:04.394
solve it for you.

00:20:08.100 --> 00:20:09.530
And then he can retire
to the Bahamas.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:13.030
GUS CLASS: That's
the profit part.

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.330
The final step.

00:20:14.330 --> 00:20:17.690
JOANNA SMITH: Monetize
this, yeah.

00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:19.040
GUS CLASS: Yeah,
that's awesome.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.030
JOANNA SMITH: I want to
charge a dollar for

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.580
solving a Rubik's cube.

00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.600
I should charge Gus a dollar
every time I fix his Buckyball

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.370
structures.

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:29.160
GUS CLASS: Yeah, that's true,
I'm always breaking them.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:30.340
I think that they break
on their own.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.720
JOANNA SMITH: No, I think it's
because you smash them.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.990
ALLEN FIRSTENBERG: What,
the Buckyballs?

00:20:34.990 --> 00:20:36.530
GUS CLASS: Buckyballs, yeah.

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:38.630
JOANNA SMITH: I'll build
something for Gus and he just

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:39.920
smashes it.

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.525
Just smashes it, every time.

00:20:42.525 --> 00:20:44.920
GUS CLASS: Yeah you may not
know it, but Joanna is

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:49.060
actually an extremely talented
Buckyball crafter.

00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.860
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: You know,
also these bad boys here.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:52.680
JOANNA SMITH: Hexiflexigon?

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.020
No, what's that?

00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.710
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: That a ball of
wax in the Chrome edition.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:57.660
JOANNA SMITH: Nice!

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:58.590
GUS CLASS: Oh, wow.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.510
JOANNA SMITH: Oh,
you're green.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:03.430
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: The green part
just gets chroma keyed.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:04.680
JOANNA SMITH: He green
screened it.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.310
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: [INAUDIBLE]
you can also build, like,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.510
crazy forms out of it.

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:19.440
ABRAHAM: You could even charge
a dollar to feed the birds.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.310
GUS CLASS: There you
go, charge a

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:22.210
dollar to feed the birds.

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.300
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: That might be
a little crazy [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.280
JOANNA SMITH: It's just like
real life at that point.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.928
Those are some hungry birds.

00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.960
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I really hope
that Google will extend

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.080
the APIs a bit more.

00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:51.680
I mean, we can do a lot of
awesome stuff right now, but

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.840
there is room for more.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.650
I mean, we have a
lot of ideas.

00:21:54.650 --> 00:21:57.590
I mean, especially Gerwin, Allen
and I, and Erin as well,

00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:59.830
and a lot of other developers.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.560
We have ideas, and at some point
we reach a dead end with

00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:04.580
the current API.

00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.630
I mean, we are in kind of
close contact with the

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:11.960
developers working on the API
and give them feedback in what

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.490
our ideas look like and where
we could extend the API or

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:18.520
where we need some more
features from the API.

00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:21.530
And they usually listen to our
feedback, and they do it in

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.010
the next release.

00:22:23.010 --> 00:22:26.960
And I think especially with
Hangouts On Air, they can

00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.930
include some more features.

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:31.810
Giving you more control.

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.530
JOANNA SMITH: This was actually
one of the questions

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:36.350
that we got in advance
was from Roy.

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:39.660
And they asked why the updates
for Google+ are so slow, and

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:42.430
why it takes so long for new
features to come out.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.330
And I think what's important to
realize is that Google+ is

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.130
taking, as a product, as a
company, we're taking a very

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.620
careful approach, where we want
to make sure that when we

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:53.280
do things, we do them right.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.450
And it does mean that sometimes
we move a little

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:58.160
slower than people would like,
but it also means that

00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.110
hopefully we'll never have to do
a really big backtracking.

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:04.420
We'll never have to take a
step back and be like, oh

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.260
gosh, that was bad.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:08.370
We're trying really hard to make
sure we do what's right

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.090
for our users as well
as our developers.

00:23:11.090 --> 00:23:13.940
We do appreciate the patience
of our developers, but we do

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:17.700
admit that it is slower than
they would like as well.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:21.370
GUS CLASS: And I mean, actually,
we do also try as

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:24.210
best we can to listen to
developers, and so Moritz,

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.350
whenever you encounter that kind
of stuff you let us know.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.900
And I think that's pretty much
what we're saying, too, is we

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.790
do respond when developers say,
we could do so much more

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:40.620
if we had just another flag on
this API that would let me

00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.860
turn on and off this feature.

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:45.860
That kind of stuff is really
useful for us to know, and it

00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:47.920
helps us help you create
really good products.

00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.820
JOANNA SMITH: Right, so talk
about it in our forums, and

00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:53.180
post it on G+ and submit it to
the issue tracker, and we're

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.430
going to get those bugs filed
and try to get those

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:57.890
features out there.

00:23:57.890 --> 00:24:00.640
Especially if it's one that's
requested often or requested

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.860
by one of our top developers.

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:05.555
Because you guys, you know
you're the best, but other

00:24:05.555 --> 00:24:09.320
people out there are trying
become good and sometimes it

00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.033
definitely takes a little bit
more time and a little bit

00:24:12.033 --> 00:24:13.283
more attention.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.550
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: The birds
are going crazy.

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:19.060
GUS CLASS: The birds
are being fed.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:23.060
JOANNA SMITH: We need Moritz's
toolbar to quiet those birds.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.040
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah but
totally, I totally agree that

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.810
the developers, or the
engineers, from Google are

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.930
really great and into the
community and really helpful

00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:34.580
and engaging with people,
even if it's on

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.025
Google+ or in the forums.

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:41.210
The communication is really
great, and they really listen

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:44.880
and care about users'
feedback.

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.750
And I really like that.

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:51.360
I mean, I've never experienced
any other company doing that

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.090
in such a great way.

00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:54.100
GUS CLASS: Well, thank you
for telling us that.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.445
That makes us feel
really good.

00:24:56.445 --> 00:25:00.930
And we have the awesomest
developers too, you know that.

00:25:00.930 --> 00:25:03.850
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Talking about
the issue tracker, I

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:07.770
found an issue and I'm still
waiting for a response.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:09.010
JOANNA SMITH: I didn't say
I'd respond, I said

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.260
I'd read them all.

00:25:13.900 --> 00:25:15.200
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: It's actually
a part of the Hangout

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.590
API where I think there's
something wrong.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.320
I think it's not even in the
API, I think it's in the talk

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.010
plug-in or something, because
when I'm using the Hangout

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:32.020
Mute function from my Toolbox,
it's muting all participants,

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:34.250
but after a while I can
hear them again.

00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:40.070
Even if their audible status
is still set to false, so I

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:42.710
shouldn't be able to hear them
at all, but I can hear them.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:44.950
So there's something
weird going on and

00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:47.210
I don't know what.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.100
JOANNA SMITH: I did
read that one.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:50.790
I spent about 20 minutes trying
to reproduce it and had

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:53.040
some trouble waiting for
it to kick back in.

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.390
And then I gave up
for the day.

00:25:57.390 --> 00:26:01.080
Part of my work schedule, I
actually dedicate x number of

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.070
hours every week to just sitting
in the issue tracker

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:06.440
and working through that and
filing the bugs accordingly.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.160
So it's definitely something
that they're aware of.

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.970
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: I think you
can reproduce it faster when

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:12.850
you start clicking

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.300
participants in the film strip.

00:26:15.300 --> 00:26:16.830
JOANNA SMITH: To like
focus on them?

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:17.390
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Yeah.

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:18.370
JOANNA SMITH: OK, that's
good to know.

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:20.700
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: Then it
happens more often, the audio

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.790
switches on again for
specific people.

00:26:23.790 --> 00:26:24.750
JOANNA SMITH: That actually
makes it--

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:28.136
OK, yeah, I'll definitely try
that later, today probably.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:38.652
GUS CLASS: The birds
are being fed.

00:26:38.652 --> 00:26:41.420
So for other participants in the
Hangout, can you guys turn

00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:44.170
on the app and feed the birds?

00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:47.370
Have you guys been feeding
the birds all day?

00:26:47.370 --> 00:26:48.620
ABRAHAM: I fed them a
little bit earlier.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.240
JOANNA SMITH: There's
the tiny URL.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.490
GUS CLASS: Oh that's right.

00:26:59.855 --> 00:27:01.850
JOANNA SMITH: See if that
can feed these birds.

00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:04.290
GUS CLASS: So then everybody
can feed the birds.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:07.255
JOANNA SMITH: Ah, I just
got a strawberry.

00:27:07.255 --> 00:27:08.650
GUS CLASS: Oh, there it is.

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:24.280
JOANNA SMITH: I like the
different hats, Erin.

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:26.230
That's cool.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:28.670
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Yeah, well, this
one whenever you change

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:32.114
his hat, [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:32.114 --> 00:27:35.870
And it actually [INAUDIBLE],
so that's pretty cool.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:42.990
Would you like to see the
inside [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:44.475
part of it?

00:27:44.475 --> 00:27:45.725
JOANNA SMITH: Show the
inside, definitely.

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:53.050
GUS CLASS: And again, and as
always we'll be watching the

00:27:53.050 --> 00:27:56.330
event and YouTube
for comments.

00:27:56.330 --> 00:27:58.960
JOANNA SMITH: So far the
only comment seems to

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:00.420
be saying good job.

00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.330
So somebody likes one of you.

00:28:03.330 --> 00:28:05.321
GUS CLASS: Somebody likes us.

00:28:05.321 --> 00:28:06.910
JOANNA SMITH: I don't know which
one of you but we'll

00:28:06.910 --> 00:28:09.360
assume all of you.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.470
GUS CLASS: Looks like
an Arduino in there?

00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:14.944
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Yeah, this
one's actually one of my

00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:18.270
custom made Arduinos, so, I
made an Arduino derivative

00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:21.250
that looks like this.

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:24.430
GUS CLASS: OK cool, yeah.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:25.940
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: There we go.

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.920
So it has a pretty cool
silk screen on it just

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.060
like a basic Arduino.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:35.360
JOANNA SMITH: Did you
laser etch that?

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.660
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: No.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.480
It's just standard PCV material
with a [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:43.730
silk screen on it.

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.766
And then inside you can
sort of see the beak

00:28:50.766 --> 00:28:52.580
mechanism in there.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:56.690
And the beak mechanism is what
translates the rotational

00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:59.825
movement from the servo into
linear movements so that it

00:28:59.825 --> 00:29:03.360
can open and close its
beak over here.

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.450
So let's see.

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:07.804
If you feed it, something
happens.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.680
[INAUDIBLE].

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:16.375
JOANNA SMITH: Yeah, I
can see it, yeah.

00:29:16.375 --> 00:29:18.495
MORITZ TOLXDORFF: It is very
impressive that it works kind

00:29:18.495 --> 00:29:19.190
of instant.

00:29:19.190 --> 00:29:23.240
I mean, I'm sharing the app
window from the Hangout, and

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.030
now that I'm clicking, the bird
is actually moving, so

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:30.090
there's actually no delay.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.970
GUS CLASS: No delay.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.500
Yeah, you can hear it.

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.930
That's pretty cool.

00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:39.822
Yeah, great work with the
web sockets there.

00:29:39.822 --> 00:29:41.560
ERIN ROBOTGRRL: Thank you.

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.590
GUS CLASS: We'll have to
add it to Oscar now.

00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:45.000
JOANNA SMITH: Got
to step it up.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.410
GUS CLASS: Got to step
it up, yeah.

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:47.800
JOANNA SMITH: Got some
competition on.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.340
OK, well, it doesn't seem like
we have very many questions

00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:54.780
coming in today.

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:57.490
But, as always, if you think of
some later and you want to

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:00.480
go ahead and ask them, just
comment on the YouTube event

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:03.040
or the Google+ event and I'll
come back and look at it.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.580
Or Gus will, or another
member of our team.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.720
As far as announcements go,
this week we don't have

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.650
anything to announce.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.590
But we do hope that everybody
has a Happy Halloween.

00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:16.480
And we would like to thank our
awesome friends for being

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.960
willing to spend their Tuesday
afternoons, or evenings, or

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.340
maybe Wednesday morning, I can't
quite tell by the time

00:30:22.340 --> 00:30:24.020
difference, with us.

00:30:24.020 --> 00:30:25.280
And we really appreciate that.

00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.810
So thank you, you guys.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.110
GUS CLASS: Yeah, thank you
everyone for coming in, and

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.060
thanks everyone for watching.

00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.310
Have a good Halloween.
