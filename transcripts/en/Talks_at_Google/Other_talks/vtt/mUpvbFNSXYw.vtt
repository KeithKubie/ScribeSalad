00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
MORGAN FREEMAN: I'm going
to tell you right now,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.480
acting is not something
you can really teach.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.400
Technique you can.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.722
But the actual art, you can't.

00:00:24.722 --> 00:00:27.222
HALLIE MEYERS-SHYER: Want me
to teach Jon the bend-and-snap?

00:00:27.222 --> 00:00:28.054
OK.

00:00:28.054 --> 00:00:31.874
OK-- and then you snap.

00:00:31.874 --> 00:00:32.886
Yes!

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:34.260
PHOEBE ROBINSON:
If you think you

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.840
have a story to tell
that's worth hearing,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.830
you're probably right.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:39.038
So you should just go for it.

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:41.630
It doesn't matter if there's
not an example there--

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.080
a blueprint-- for you to follow.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.210
You can be the first one.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.525
And you can kind of figure
things out yourself.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:49.090
WYCLEF JEAN: (SINGING)
Every time I make a run,

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.280
girl, you turn around and cry.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.140
I ask myself, why, o, why.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.900
TONY PATRICK: You're mistaking
whatever the current trend

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.680
in thought is for knowing more.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.431
Sometimes, people are
wrong for millennia.

00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:05.846
JAMES MONROE: I'm actually
having a very long conversation

00:01:05.846 --> 00:01:06.720
with Daveed.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.830
And Daveed said, no, man.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.900
Look, bring your
swagger to the show.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.094
And I was like, are you sure?

00:01:14.094 --> 00:01:16.260

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:45.830
GAELYNN LEA: The problem
isn't the disability itself.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.070
It's society's inaccessibility.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.070
And when you reframe it that
way, it takes away the pity.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.140
And it also puts
responsibility on society

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.094
to make sure that they're doing
a good job of being accessible.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.430
IRENE ZISBLATT: The Holocaust
is not just a part of history.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.229
But it lingers in the present.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.760
Perhaps, when we were forgetting
how powerful hatred can be,

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.694
9/11 reminded us.

00:02:16.694 --> 00:02:19.110
DIANNA COWERN: I had some
really awesome physics teachers.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.515
So never--

00:02:19.515 --> 00:02:19.770
SPEAKER: I know.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.436
DIANNA COWERN:
--underestimate the value

00:02:21.436 --> 00:02:24.210
of what you can do to
instill the curiosity

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.380
and the excitement on the
young people in your life.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.910
WILLIAM MCDONOUGH: We want to
make imagination enhancers,

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.710
systems that help people
become better thinkers,

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.652
independently of the
system they're using.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.380
AL GORE: Successfully
resolving this

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.150
is the key to redeeming
our destiny as human beings

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.000
and saying to the
generations that follow,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.110
we did the right thing.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.010
MICHAEL J. FOX: No one
dies from Parkinson's.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.230
You die with Parkinson's.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.384
And so I'm living
with Parkinson's.

00:03:18.172 --> 00:03:19.880
ANTHONY BOURDAIN:
Well, I was quite sure,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.440
when I wrote "Kitchen
Confidential," that no one was

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.148
going to read it.

00:03:22.148 --> 00:03:25.790
And that was a very
liberating thing

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.750
because I didn't have
the burden of trying

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.520
to imagine what
people would expect,

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.860
or what they might
like or dislike,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.057
or what the market wanted.

00:03:36.057 --> 00:03:37.890
I wasn't thinking about
any of those things.

YIN PIN XIU:

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:48.500
THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN: Then, when
you press the Pause button

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.210
on a computer, it stops.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:52.700
But when you press the Pause
button on a human being,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.440
it starts.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.026
ANNA AKBARI: You don't
even know if you're

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:55.192
going to be around tomorrow.

00:03:55.192 --> 00:03:59.879
So you have to find a way to
be happy along the journey.

RIC FLAIR: And you guys will
be going 200 miles-an-hour

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.150

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.010
And I'll be going, whoo!

ATUL GAWANDE: Thank you for
taking time on your lunch

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.149

MARTIN ATKINS: Just be nice.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.410
The good thing is, there are
some people being nice to them.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:26.785
You don't have to
buy them a car.

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:28.576
And if someone's at
that point where you've

00:04:28.576 --> 00:04:31.100
got to buy a car for them
to go, thanks for the car,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.387
the car isn't going to
make a difference anyway.

00:04:33.387 --> 00:04:35.720
ORIT KOPE: When you're talking
about Trump and Hillary--

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.750
there are so many more stories
around the world happening--

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.790
terror attacks in Egypt and
so on-- that people do talk,

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.397
but maybe not enough.

00:04:43.397 --> 00:04:45.230
SIMON SINEK: I wish all
organizations-- they

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.650
don't have to be nation-states.

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.980
I wish all organizations
did the same thing,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.980
operated not just
in their interest,

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.150
but also have a sense
of code or values

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.723
and a sense of
purpose and vision.

00:04:57.723 --> 00:05:08.257
IRENE VILLA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

does not do a good job

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.390
looking at itself in the
mirror and being like, oh, OK.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:14.010
I see what's coming back at me.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.780
RUSSELL BRAND: If
you don't acknowledge

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.410
you've got a problem,
how can you intervene

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:17.340
in your own consciousness?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.130
You have to intervene.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.000
This is the problem.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.480
Second, you have to believe
that change is possible.

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.980
Right?

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.570
You have to be open to the
possibility of new data.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.111
OMAR SAIF GHOBASH:
I keep coming back

00:05:26.111 --> 00:05:28.590
to the idea of how
technology changes

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.140
our, perhaps, psychology,
how it changes

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:32.700
our relationship to each other.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.670
NOAM CHOMSKY: How did we
develop creative capacities

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.352
of a unique kind which have led
to extraordinary achievements?

00:05:41.352 --> 00:05:42.810
OK, these are things
we would ought

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.770
to try and understand,
all of them,

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.130
and then do something about
them, not just understand.
