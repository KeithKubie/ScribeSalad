00:00:06.097 --> 00:00:08.180
JORGE CUETO: Everyone,
welcome to talks at Google.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.110
Today, we have Amanda
Bradford, the founder and CEO

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.470
of dating app the League.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.840
The League is a dating
app that combines

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.930
data and social graphs from
both Facebook and LinkedIn

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.560
to offer privacy from
coworkers, more context

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.770
about a potential match,
and a curated community

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.730
of ambitious singles who desire
an equally driven partner.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.460
Amanda previously worked
in technical roles

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.220
at both Salesforce
and Google and holds

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.750
an MBA from Stanford University
and a BS in information systems

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.280
from Carnegie Mellon.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.005
It's a great pleasure for us to
have Amanda here with us today.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:47.255
AMANDA BRADFORD: Thanks, guys.

00:00:47.255 --> 00:00:49.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:50.544 --> 00:00:52.085
JORGE CUETO: So to
get started, maybe

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:54.756
you could tell us a little
bit about how you came up

00:00:54.756 --> 00:00:56.880
with the idea for the
League, because it definitely

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.190
has a unique spin
on the dating app.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.090
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah, I
drew from my own experiences,

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.750
I like to say.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.880
So I kind of followed
your classic design

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.150
a product that you want
to use, and don't really

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.030
listen other people, and
then kind of figure it out

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.620
once you launch it.

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.800
So I was at Stanford Business
School, which is obviously

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.530
a very selective community.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.810
It's a pretty intense
admissions process.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.430
I think I planned
for about two years

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.680
on, like, how I was going
to get into Stanford and all

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.763
the things I needed to do.

00:01:26.763 --> 00:01:30.930
And so you could argue, like,
the longer prep time you have,

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.510
the better your application
is for business school.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.880
And so I think part
of what inspired me

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.650
around this, kind
of taking that model

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.920
and overlay it onto the
dating community, is, A,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.621
how effective it was
in matching people.

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.120
I think Peter can
talk to this, too.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.369
Our class, I think we had,
like, 20 or 30 couples that

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.750
just formed in the first month.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.820
And you're kind of
like, what is it

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.600
about this community that kind
of creates a way that people

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.100
can kind of feel
connected faster?

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.290
And I think it is because
people did put their best

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.070
effort into their profile.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.760
They worked really hard.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.343
They made sure their
photos were good.

00:02:01.343 --> 00:02:03.607
They put their application
in, and they waited.

00:02:03.607 --> 00:02:05.190
And then when they
join the community,

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:06.690
they're there for
the right reasons.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:08.610
And they have kind of
the right-- you know,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.620
they're going to their class,
and they're taking notes.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:12.090
And it's sort of like
they're good students,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.640
because you put all
this time into it.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.820
And so I think that's
sort of the concept

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.361
I want to take into
dating, because I

00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:18.480
think dating suffers
from people having

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.370
a lack of a kind of
intent or motivation

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.990
to have a really core kind
of relationship-seeking

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.590
experience.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.110
There's a lot of
these casual apps.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.030
So I wanted to kind of take what
I learned at business school

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.920
and how Stanford did
such a good job of kind

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.330
of creating this diverse but
very interconnected community.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.900
And how could I create,
like, a digital version

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.500
of a business school?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.280
And so I think that was sort of
the kind of high-level vision.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.655
And then, of
course, it gets down

00:02:45.655 --> 00:02:48.330
into the nuts and bolts of
execution, which is not--

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.390
you can't always execute things
the right way, the perfect way,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.140
on V1.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.770
So I think we're kind
of working towards that.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.600
But, yeah, so that was, I
guess, the impetus of me.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.200
I was single.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.241
I was in business school.

00:02:59.241 --> 00:03:01.140
And I was like, I want
this app because I

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.720
want to save myself
time and bad dates

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.470
and terrible conversations.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.950
So I was optimizing kind of
for myself, I guess, selfishly.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.360
And then I found myself
writing feature requests

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.815
into, like, Hinge, and Coffee
Meets Bagel, and Tinder.

00:03:15.815 --> 00:03:17.190
And I was literally
writing them,

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.690
like, what I thought
they should do.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.880
And then I remember I
googled all the founders.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.020
And I was looking
at their background.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.680
I'm like, wait a minute.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.690
I'm more technical
than all of these guys.

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.189
And I, like, worked
at a tech company.

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.980
These guys had come
from finance and stuff.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.141
I was like, why am I writing
them feature requests?

00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:32.640
I was, like, writing
specs for them.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.100
And I was like, I'm just going
to go and build this myself.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.300
So I kind of talked myself
into going and starting

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.190
this project, instead
of kind of complaining

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.565
about how much dating apps
suck all the time, which I was.

00:03:44.565 --> 00:03:46.160
JORGE CUETO: Yeah,
that's awesome.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.930
So what would you say is the
one differentiating feature

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.730
from the League that sets it
apart from other dating apps

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.230
out there?

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.688
What would you say
to someone who's

00:03:53.688 --> 00:03:55.890
maybe using Tinder or Bumble?

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:59.539
AMANDA BRADFORD: I always think
our three core pillars or value

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.080
proposition is, one,
we just give you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.590
much more context about a user.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.690
So we have your LinkedIn.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.981
We're pulling your LinkedIn
data and your Facebook data

00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:08.165
and your kind of League
data that you give us.

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:10.290
So you just know more
information about the person,

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.915
like, step one.

00:04:10.915 --> 00:04:14.040
And then step two, because
we pull that social graph

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.670
from work and your social life,
so your Facebook friends, we

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:19.561
actually block you
from what I think

00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:21.810
are awkward and unnecessary
interactions, to be, like,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.602
matched with your
colleague on a dating app

00:04:23.602 --> 00:04:25.393
when you're working on
a project with them.

00:04:25.393 --> 00:04:27.280
That's just, I think,
an unnecessary thing.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.779
And we don't need
to do that anymore

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.330
because we have the social
graphs at our disposal.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:32.755
So I think setting
up that privacy

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:35.130
so people feel like it's a
very safe place, that they can

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.270
be single, and they don't have
to worry about kind of bleeding

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.770
into work, and then the last
piece is that community aspect.

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.610
I think having a community where
people, whether or not they

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.890
are that, they
are self-selecting

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.680
into a community that is for
an egalitarian relationship.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.389
They are kind of stating
somewhat that they are open to,

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.680
you know, a power couple
relationship or a relationship

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.890
where both parties are equal.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.806
And so I think creating
a community where that

00:04:58.806 --> 00:05:00.210
is the ethos and the values.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.430
And maybe not everyone
upholds them all the time.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.010
But if that's kind of
part of the table stakes

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.780
to even get in, I
think that's sort

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.882
of how you create a really
good value system and community

00:05:10.882 --> 00:05:11.465
like a Google.

00:05:11.465 --> 00:05:13.564
You know, Google has a
great internal community.

00:05:13.564 --> 00:05:15.480
So I always kind of think
is I want to create,

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.250
where all the people
that use the League,

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.666
it feels like a
bunch of Googlers.

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:23.239
And they're all debating around
how we should kind of dictate

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.780
the community or
what rules we should

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:25.930
put in place, what governance.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.970
And I want the community to be
involved in those decisions.

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.150
I don't want to be, like, a
big brother, where we're like,

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.870
here's what you need to do.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.453
And you get kicked
out if you do this.

00:05:32.453 --> 00:05:34.180
I want it to be
kind of democracy.

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:36.320
So we're kind of
focusing on how do we

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:38.040
build the social
aspect of the community

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.500
so that our users can help
us with some of these harder

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.333
decisions about when
do we kick someone out?

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:43.847
Or when do we let that profile--

00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:45.180
you know, is that League-worthy?

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.620
And what are we
calling League-worthy?

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.036
And as we kind of
talk about a lot

00:05:48.036 --> 00:05:50.550
of these existential
questions, we

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:52.170
want our users to
feel involved, as

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.000
if it's their
community that they're

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.412
getting to have a voice in.

00:05:56.412 --> 00:05:57.870
JORGE CUETO: The
definition of what

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:59.610
you consider to
be League-worthy,

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.154
has that changed over time?

00:06:01.154 --> 00:06:02.820
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah,
I like that word.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.611
We came up with that
word because, I think,

00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:06.820
it's purposefully ambiguous.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:10.920
But I think what we've seen
is, yeah, it definitely has

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.290
changed, definitely by region.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.560
So you go from New York,
where almost half your users

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.899
are in finance or tech
or media, basically.

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:22.440
And then you go to somewhere,
like, we just launched Houston.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.260
Oil and gas is the
number-one industry there.

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.190
So really understanding,
we had a whole table

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.420
of kind of classifications
on programs, schools,

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.910
and different jobs.

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.500
For instance, Comcast in
Philadelphia is like the Google

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.000
there.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Like So we had to kind of
re-rank and recalibrate

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.990
a lot of how we thought
about sort of selection

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:44.520
and what we were
using as our proxy

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.980
because if you think
about it, we're

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.230
copying the Google
playbook, which is use GPA

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:52.010
as a proxy for intelligence.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.760
I remember when I first
started at Google.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.220
Half my friends were like,
I don't have a 3.75 GPA,

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.720
so I can't apply.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:00.000
And Google's line
was always like,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.960
we know that GPA is a stupid
indicator, but it's a proxy.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.370
And it's not a bad one.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:06.660
And I remember when we did
the case study on that.

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.290
I was like, I think
that's what we do.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.670
That's what we do with kind
of education and profession.

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:12.804
We know it's not perfect.

00:07:12.804 --> 00:07:14.970
There's definitely a lot
of other things and factors

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.490
to evaluate, but it's a proxy.

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.069
And it does a pretty good,
like, 80% of the job.

00:07:19.069 --> 00:07:21.360
And I think that's where the
kind of fun, exciting part

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.943
is, where you get
the humans involved.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:26.029
And we can kind of build a
perfect solution next to it.

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:28.320
JORGE CUETO: What are some
of the factors that you take

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.900
into account for determining
whether someone should get

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:33.090
approved or not, besides GPA?

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.632
AMANDA BRADFORD:
We don't ask GPA.

00:07:34.632 --> 00:07:36.090
But we have their
LinkedIn profile.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.190
So you can see what
institutions they have attended,

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.630
and you can see
what jobs they've

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.546
held, what titles they've
had, the progression

00:07:41.546 --> 00:07:42.240
of their titles.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.370
You can kind of see.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:45.540
You get a decent
indication of if someone

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.910
is relatively ambitious
from their LinkedIn profile.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:50.370
So I think that's sort
of one thing we look for,

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:51.520
is just sort of that.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.770
I kind of think of the League.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:54.644
It is a little bit of
a workaholic community.

00:07:54.644 --> 00:07:57.060
Everyone in it, they're working.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:59.769
Work is one of their passions,
and that is a shared value that

00:07:59.769 --> 00:08:01.060
is shared across the community.

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.197
So I think one of your
questions was about, like,

00:08:04.197 --> 00:08:05.280
screening based on values.

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.130
But I actually would argue that
the people who join the League

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.150
value education.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.740
They also value
ambition, and they

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.210
value people going after
and accomplishing things.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:15.360
And so I think to
me, we've kind of

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.420
created one of the few
value-based dating communities,

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.050
rather than kind of the
Walmarts of the world, where

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:23.425
they're just sort of people.

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:25.050
So I think we've kind
of tried to embed

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:26.764
the values into our brand.

00:08:26.764 --> 00:08:29.430
JORGE CUETO: And then one of the
other things that you mentioned

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:32.820
is your experience in
large tech companies

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.470
is sort of what made
you realize, hey.

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.000
If all these other
people who didn't

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.580
have technical background could
do it, then I can also do it.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.121
So maybe could you
share a little bit

00:08:40.121 --> 00:08:42.929
about how you drew on your
experiences and the skills

00:08:42.929 --> 00:08:45.550
you developed while working
at Salesforce and Google

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.890
to help you when you
started your company?

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.348
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah, I mean,
I think the three key skills

00:08:50.348 --> 00:08:51.900
I learned were sales.

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.450
Starting a company, I
would say the first two

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.040
years is, like, 90% sales.

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.490
And then the second two years,
I feel like maybe 70% sales.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:02.609
But for the most part, you're
moving into a sales role

00:09:02.609 --> 00:09:04.150
essentially when
you start a company.

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:06.930
So I think having a quota,
having learned how to sell,

00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.450
having learned what it feels
like to miss your quota,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.240
what it feels like to do
really well and go to a club,

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:16.350
and kind of understand how
kind of the sales mentality

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.570
works I think is super
helpful, because when

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:19.860
you start your company,
you're pitching investors.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:20.943
You're pitching employees.

00:09:20.943 --> 00:09:22.260
You're pitching senior leaders.

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:23.460
You're pitching partners.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.690
So you're always pitching.

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:26.190
You're pitching people
to join your app and say,

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.680
this is where you're going to
meet your significant other.

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.430
So I'm pitching users.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:33.750
So I think having that sales
experience was super helpful,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.091
and I think it allows you
to kind of learn how to be

00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:38.340
confident, even if you're not.

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.694
So I think when I was
at DoubleClick, well,

00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:42.360
I was at Google.

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.425
But I was selling
DoubleClick for Publishers,

00:09:43.425 --> 00:09:46.410
which if any of you guys know,
is a very complex product

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:47.760
and has a lot of legacy.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.080
There were actually
two products happening

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.996
when I was selling it.

00:09:49.996 --> 00:09:52.920
So I was selling XFP and
DFP, depending on what

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.530
use case the publisher needed.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.092
And it was a lot of hand-waving.

00:09:59.092 --> 00:10:00.300
That's a very complex system.

00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:01.500
So you had to learn
it inside and out,

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:03.120
and then be able to answer
all the questions about it,

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.190
and then also be able
to pitch it in a way

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:09.090
that made the development team
or whoever your buyer was sign

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.910
the check to actually
implement the product.

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.450
So I think at Google,
especially at Google,

00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:17.620
I got very deep into kind
of the technical, like,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:20.380
understanding how the
algorithms work for forecasting.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:22.170
So I think getting
into the weeds

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.044
and getting experience really--

00:10:24.044 --> 00:10:26.210
I remember reading a spec
at Google that I was like,

00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.668
this is so over my
head, because it

00:10:27.668 --> 00:10:29.940
was about kind of all
the math equations that

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.450
go into the actual
forecasting of the ads,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.970
of if they were going to
run out of ad inventory.

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.380
So it's a very complex system.

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:39.270
But I think getting
experience, getting

00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:41.310
super deep and technical,
even if you're not

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:43.170
the technical person,
but being able to wrap

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.390
your head around it, because I
think that allowed me to have

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.520
the product management skills
that I could kind of go

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.010
and design these really complex
systems and manage people,

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.570
implementing them, and not kind
of get over my head, I guess.

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:55.710
So I think learning
how to kind of digest

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.100
large pieces of information
and understand it and be

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.070
able to explain
it back to people.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:02.528
JORGE CUETO: What
would you say was

00:11:02.528 --> 00:11:04.956
the hardest part of the process
of starting the company?

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:06.330
Was there anything
that maybe was

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.790
harder than you expected
before you went into it?

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:12.460
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah, oh,
everything, yeah, everything,

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:16.674
across the board, I think
for me, I waited a long time.

00:11:16.674 --> 00:11:19.090
I wanted to really make sure
that the-- because you asked,

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.390
like, when did you want
to start a company?

00:11:20.390 --> 00:11:22.070
I was like, I was
just building an app.

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:23.570
I built an app that
I wanted to use,

00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.170
and then I wanted to see
if there was a potential

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:26.837
to be a company.

00:11:26.837 --> 00:11:28.044
Did we have a business model?

00:11:28.044 --> 00:11:29.480
Were people going
to spend money?

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:30.580
I didn't know that.

00:11:30.580 --> 00:11:33.070
For a while, even
before we monetized,

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.100
we didn't know if we just had,
like, a nice, little lifestyle

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:36.700
dating app.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.500
Which who knows what's
going to happen?

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.791
But we didn't know if people
were going to spend money.

00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:42.859
So you kind of don't know
the value of your asset

00:11:42.859 --> 00:11:43.650
until you monetize.

00:11:43.650 --> 00:11:45.291
So I think that was
something I wish we

00:11:45.291 --> 00:11:46.540
had done a little bit earlier.

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:50.200
I think I would have taken less
dilutive funding and things

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.440
like that because we would have
realized that our users are OK

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.800
paying and have the
kind of income to pay.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.394
So we sort of kind of
delayed our experimentation

00:12:00.394 --> 00:12:01.810
on monetization a
little bit late.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:03.771
So I think that was
something that I

00:12:03.771 --> 00:12:05.770
think would have made it
easier because we would

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:08.061
have known that, OK, we can
expect this amount of money

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:08.810
coming in.

00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.955
So we don't need to be running
as fast or as stressed out.

00:12:11.955 --> 00:12:14.080
We kind of all thought we
were running out of money

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.424
for, like, the second year.

00:12:15.424 --> 00:12:16.840
So we were just
like, oh, my gosh.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.060
Let's work 100 hour weeks.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.520
So I think my other
takeaway was just

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.747
hiring a little bit earlier.

00:12:22.747 --> 00:12:24.580
I waited a very long
time because I wanted--

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.650
before I recruited
amazing people like you

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.224
guys from your amazing
jobs at places like Google,

00:12:30.224 --> 00:12:32.890
I wanted to make sure that I had
a real kind of compelling pitch

00:12:32.890 --> 00:12:34.909
to convince someone
to join my team,

00:12:34.909 --> 00:12:36.700
that we're not going
to go under in a year.

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.240
I'm going to be able
to pay you market rate.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.820
So I wanted to kind
of be in that position

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.284
to hire really amazing people.

00:12:44.284 --> 00:12:46.700
But because of that, we're
just now kind of getting there.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.158
So for three years,
I basically was

00:12:48.158 --> 00:12:51.700
running all the departments,
pretty poorly, I would say,

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.959
you know, at a B, B-minus level.

00:12:53.959 --> 00:12:55.000
So I was doing marketing.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:55.900
I'm doing design.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.600
I was doing, like,
the ad creative.

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.830
So I think that was
the hardest part,

00:12:59.830 --> 00:13:04.610
was just being kind of a
one-man show for too long.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:07.210
JORGE CUETO: So out of all those
functions that you took on,

00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:08.050
which was your favorite?

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.040
Is there anything that
you enjoyed in particular?

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.415
AMANDA BRADFORD:
I realized this.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:12.760
I love copywriting.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.270
So my future dream job is
that I get to just do, like,

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.100
the fun copywriting
for the League,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:20.740
and everybody else can
do all the other work.

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:23.570
So, yeah, I think you learn
a lot because you're--

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.664
you kind of think of it
as you're all over the--

00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:27.580
if you think of the
company as, like, a stack,

00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.600
you're moving across the stack.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.450
And you're doing
email marketing.

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:32.890
Then you're doing Facebook ads.

00:13:32.890 --> 00:13:35.410
Then you're figuring out
how to set up HR and Zendesk

00:13:35.410 --> 00:13:38.290
and get the support
team to integrate it

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.750
into Slack so that people
can open a JIRA ticket.

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:44.345
So it's like you're doing
every job in the company.

00:13:44.345 --> 00:13:45.970
In some ways, it's
awesome, because you

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:48.637
get to really know what your
strengths and weaknesses are,

00:13:48.637 --> 00:13:50.470
really obviously, because
you're like, whoa.

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:52.330
I'm actually really
not good at design.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.371
That was not a good logo,
so I'm really glad we

00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:55.370
didn't go with that one.

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.860
But I worked on the logo for
probably, like, 40 hours.

00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.735
And then finally my
friend was like, I'm just

00:13:59.735 --> 00:14:02.920
taking this off your plate
because yours are not good.

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.540
But learning that,
right, and so now I

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:07.270
know that I need to have a
creative director that I always

00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:08.046
run stuff by.

00:14:08.046 --> 00:14:09.670
And she has a really
good eye for this.

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.087
So I think you
start to recognize.

00:14:11.087 --> 00:14:12.586
Especially when
you're young and you

00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:14.530
think you're good at
everything, I kind of

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:17.560
learned what I wasn't good
at and who I needed to hire.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.422
So I think in some ways, it
was helpful to kind of do

00:14:20.422 --> 00:14:21.880
everything because
then I was like,

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.110
these things I'm really bad at.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.068
I'm not very organized.

00:14:24.068 --> 00:14:26.140
So I'm actually not a
great product manager.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:29.260
We just hired a PM, and
he's really organized.

00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:33.870
So he's going to complement my
more sporadic style of PMing,

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.370
I guess.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.850
So I think it's kind of
recognizing your holes

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:39.334
and trying to find people
to complement them.

00:14:39.334 --> 00:14:40.750
JORGE CUETO: What
advice would you

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.180
give to someone who is currently
at a big company, who's

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.890
maybe interested in
starting a company

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.290
or on the fence about it?

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:48.580
AMANDA BRADFORD: So I was you.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.060
And what I did is I did
this, like, weekend,

00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:54.666
weeknight incubator
when I was at Google.

00:14:54.666 --> 00:14:55.540
And my boss was cool.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.190
She let me leave
early on Thursdays.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:58.540
I think I had to get down there.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.860
It was, like, one night a week.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.110
And then I think the team
could meet on the weekend.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.649
But it was a good kind
of jumping off point,

00:15:04.649 --> 00:15:06.940
like, dipping your toe in
the water of entrepreneurship

00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.980
because it was, like,
a 12-week program.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.560
The idea was at the end, we
kind of do a pitch night.

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.290
And you decide if anyone's
ideas kind of have legs.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:15.357
And people vote on them.

00:15:15.357 --> 00:15:17.690
And then some of the teams
stay together and work on it.

00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:18.470
Some don't.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:22.615
But I think, given that you
guys are not at graduate school,

00:15:22.615 --> 00:15:24.490
like, there's a lot of
project courses there.

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.280
But there are some that will
be in San Francisco or Mountain

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:29.572
View that can kind of
serve that same purpose.

00:15:29.572 --> 00:15:31.030
And I think that
was helpful to me,

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:33.239
because that was my first
foray into realizing that--

00:15:33.239 --> 00:15:34.780
I was like, oh, I
actually don't have

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:36.400
that many skills to
bring to the table

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.900
because we were a group of four.

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.237
And I wasn't the one
building the website.

00:15:41.237 --> 00:15:42.820
I said I was going
to be the designer.

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:44.195
And that was when
I first started

00:15:44.195 --> 00:15:47.710
realizing that I wasn't as good
at design as I thought I was.

00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:50.609
But I think you
kind of learn how

00:15:50.609 --> 00:15:52.900
to go through the motions of
a startup and kind of what

00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:55.726
the really annoying and
hard parts are going to be

00:15:55.726 --> 00:15:57.350
and what the fun
parts are going to be.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:15:59.433
JORGE CUETO: And one of
the ways that you can grow

00:15:59.433 --> 00:16:02.220
is, as you mentioned, by moving
into new markets, new regions.

00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.570
So I read recently,
I think on Forbes,

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.820
that you guys are
moving into Houston

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.897
or have recently
moved into Houston.

00:16:08.897 --> 00:16:10.980
So how did you decide that
that was the right time

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:12.022
to move into that market?

00:16:12.022 --> 00:16:14.146
AMANDA BRADFORD: Well, you
brought up a good point.

00:16:14.146 --> 00:16:16.650
It was how do you grow without
reducing your selectivity?

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:19.620
One way to do that is to kind
of move to different cities.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:22.150
So you keep New York
as what New York is.

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:23.142
You keep them well.

00:16:23.142 --> 00:16:24.600
And then you go
and launch Houston,

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:25.980
and you're selective in Houston.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:30.250
So that's one way to grow
that we are working on now.

00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.400
So we've launched 20
cities this summer.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:35.592
So that's, like, one growth
channel, is just city launches,

00:16:35.592 --> 00:16:37.050
letting our users
know we're there.

00:16:37.050 --> 00:16:39.360
Once they use the app,
share at a higher rate.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:42.870
So honestly, opening cities
is one of our key growth

00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:43.422
strategies.

00:16:43.422 --> 00:16:44.880
And then I think
the other one will

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.510
be trying to understand
how to grow virally

00:16:48.510 --> 00:16:49.770
within a specific community.

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.830
So within Houston, we
have, like, a ton of people

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:53.697
from Deloitte.

00:16:53.697 --> 00:16:56.280
I think we got the whole Houston
Deloitte office or something.

00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.450
So it's like, how do we--

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.658
but we don't have a ton of
other sign ups in Houston.

00:16:59.658 --> 00:17:04.210
So how do we kind of smartly
and automatedly go and say, OK.

00:17:04.210 --> 00:17:05.640
You have a ton of
Deloitte people.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:08.849
How do we maybe create a
Deloitte promotion or some sort

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:11.060
of-- you know, leverage
that kind of core network

00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.601
you have to get the
eccentric people.

00:17:12.601 --> 00:17:15.310
So I think we're kind of trying
to now think a little bit more,

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:16.768
how do you take
grassroots strategy

00:17:16.768 --> 00:17:20.280
and automate it into your
sort of launch strategy

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:21.825
and your launch marketing?

00:17:21.825 --> 00:17:23.700
So that's what we're
kind of focusing on now.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.130
JORGE CUETO: Do you have
any specific changes

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:28.920
in terms of your overall
product vision or maybe

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.740
some key features
that you implemented

00:17:30.740 --> 00:17:33.540
that changed the way people
use the app now compared

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:35.100
to when you first started?

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:36.850
AMANDA BRADFORD: First
and foremost, we'll

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.180
always be kind of just
improving the core product value

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.554
proposition, which is we are
going to deliver you someone

00:17:41.554 --> 00:17:43.590
that we think you'll
be compatible with.

00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:46.110
But the stuff that I'm
really excited about that

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:49.350
isn't as revenue-generating
and kind of viral

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.170
but that we're excited
about is we're creating

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:54.750
a singles map, anonymous.

00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:56.549
But this has been
my dream since--

00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:58.590
we just didn't have the
development team to do it

00:17:58.590 --> 00:17:59.756
when we launched the League.

00:17:59.756 --> 00:18:01.530
And it was a little
bit of a side feature.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.205
But basically, the idea is let's
say your friend is recently

00:18:05.205 --> 00:18:07.080
out of a relationship,
and it's Friday night.

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.050
And you want to take
her out, rebound,

00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:13.417
go out and, like, drink and
meet some nice, single people.

00:18:13.417 --> 00:18:14.750
So you're like, where do you go?

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:16.860
And in San Francisco,
that's a very hard question.

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:18.510
You're like, there's
nowhere to go.

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:19.800
Where are the single people?

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.550
So basically, what we
want to do is allow people

00:18:23.550 --> 00:18:25.620
to kind of refresh
the map and then see

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.960
where-- you know, if all the
single people are at-- what

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.585
is the one in Mountain View, the
big bar you guys always go to,

00:18:30.585 --> 00:18:32.000
the Google bar?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.632
Sports, yeah, so if
everyone's at Sports Page,

00:18:35.632 --> 00:18:37.590
then you could see that
on the map and be like,

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.464
maybe Sports Page is a
good Friday-night spot.

00:18:40.464 --> 00:18:41.130
So I don't know.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.374
We'll see how it goes.

00:18:43.374 --> 00:18:44.790
We're kind of
MVPing it right now.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:47.310
But I think the idea
is I want to increase

00:18:47.310 --> 00:18:49.380
the efficiency of just
the whole problem, which

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.200
is, A, single people don't know
other people are single, right?

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.090
So that's sort of why I love the
slap bracelets that we always

00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:56.485
do, because it's like when you
wear a glow in the dark slap

00:18:56.485 --> 00:18:57.570
bracelet, you are single.

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.879
So you're not going to have
any of the kind of accidental

00:19:00.879 --> 00:19:03.420
you're hitting on someone who
has a boyfriend or a girlfriend

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.378
or something like that.

00:19:04.378 --> 00:19:08.490
So I personally want to add more
clarity and transparency and

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:09.630
efficiency to the process.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:11.729
And I think our users
are smart enough

00:19:11.729 --> 00:19:13.270
to kind of figure
a lot of stuff out.

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.000
It's just like we're
trying to remove

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.680
kind of the noise
and the clutter

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:19.800
and help them get
to the end goal

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:24.365
faster, which is meeting
someone offline that you fancy.

00:19:24.365 --> 00:19:25.740
JORGE CUETO: The
map feature sort

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.100
of reminds me of the
new Snapchat map, yeah.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.100
AMANDA BRADFORD: I know.

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:32.980
Well, I mean, I'm not a Snapchat
user because I'm too old,

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:33.670
I decided.

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:36.370
I was like, Instagram,
I'm stopping at Instagram.

00:19:36.370 --> 00:19:38.634
But I just looked at
the Snapchat feature,

00:19:38.634 --> 00:19:39.550
and it's very similar.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:41.299
We want to keep ours
anonymous, of course,

00:19:41.299 --> 00:19:43.700
so you're not like,
that's really creepy,

00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.540
to be like, that match
didn't like me back.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.840
But he's over here.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.720
You don't want people to
have too much information.

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.260
But I think just getting
a high-level understanding

00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.470
of where your kind of nightlife
is going on in your city.

00:19:55.470 --> 00:19:57.240
And then I think
then, to me, this

00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:01.590
helps us move into more of a
social-networking-like vibe

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.100
and aspect.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.110
And then if you can have people
who aren't single and single

00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:06.412
just using the app as kind
of a nightlife radar app,

00:20:06.412 --> 00:20:08.370
then I think it becomes
a lot more interesting.

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:10.740
And we can start to think
about can we actually become

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.760
a social network?

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.761
Or are we always going to be,
you know, a dating service?

00:20:14.761 --> 00:20:17.010
JORGE CUETO: Yeah, so I think
in San Francisco's case,

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:18.426
there are single
people out there.

00:20:18.426 --> 00:20:21.090
But a really hard part of the
process is that everyone's

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:21.930
so busy that--

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:22.900
AMANDA BRADFORD: They're
all at SoulCycle, man.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.480
JORGE CUETO: --it's really hard
for people to align schedules

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.062
to meet up.

00:20:25.062 --> 00:20:26.520
So I think that
anything you can do

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:30.434
to make the process of actually
meeting up more seamless,

00:20:30.434 --> 00:20:31.600
I think that would be great.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:33.474
AMANDA BRADFORD: We
invested a lot in events.

00:20:33.474 --> 00:20:36.120
We have actually another feature
that we're coming out with is,

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:38.184
like, a fully
aggregated event feeds.

00:20:38.184 --> 00:20:39.600
So right now, we
just kind of hand

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.970
pick cool events in
our cities that we

00:20:41.970 --> 00:20:43.500
think are on brand and cool.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:46.050
But instead, I think as we
think about moving into more

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:49.770
of a utility and trying to be
a social network that people

00:20:49.770 --> 00:20:52.860
actually depend on and
use on a weekly basis,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.910
then we want to start getting
into understanding kind

00:20:56.910 --> 00:20:59.220
of where the user is,
why they're opening

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.470
the app at that time, and
what kind of their use case

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:02.362
is at that moment.

00:21:02.362 --> 00:21:04.320
So we don't want to get
into, like, the Tinder,

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:05.880
like, I'm looking for tonight--

00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:06.850
where do I go tonight--

00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:07.350
thing.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.450
But I think of it as
more of, like, events.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:11.070
If I can meet
three of my matches

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.930
by going to the Tipsy
Pig on Friday night,

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:14.520
and I don't have to
have a 1 and 1/2,

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:16.260
like, awkward
Starbucks interview

00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:20.037
meeting with three people
during my workday, to me,

00:21:20.037 --> 00:21:21.120
that's way more efficient.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.010
I got to kind of meet them
in a more fun environment.

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:24.030
Maybe I hit it off
with some of them.

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:24.750
Maybe I didn't.

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.730
I got to talk to them
for 5 or 10 minutes.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.021
Maybe I like all three of them.

00:21:28.021 --> 00:21:30.192
But I think to me, like,
kind of moving group,

00:21:30.192 --> 00:21:31.650
like what Grouper
used to do, which

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:34.350
was a competitor that died,
but they set up three people,

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:36.790
three guys and three girls.

00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:38.690
And people actually
really liked that.

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:40.440
I remember when I was
doing user research.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.820
People liked the concept.

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:43.382
There wasn't a lot of retention.

00:21:43.382 --> 00:21:44.590
They had a retention problem.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.910
No one did, like,
a second Grouper.

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:47.580
But there is something
there, I think,

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:52.279
with not requiring everyone
to go to these one-on-one kind

00:21:52.279 --> 00:21:53.320
of interview-style dates.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.680
And if we can kind of
change the format of dating

00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.950
and make it more group and fun
and oriented around values,

00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:01.320
or hobbies, or yoga,
or people with dogs,

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.840
or whatever it might
be, I think that to me

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.730
that's a much more efficient way
to date and to meet new people.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:11.492
JORGE CUETO: What would you say
is one feature that the League

00:22:11.492 --> 00:22:13.950
offers that a lot of people
don't know about that maybe you

00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:15.600
wish they knew?

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.484
AMANDA BRADFORD: Well, I guess
I would say, a lot of people

00:22:18.484 --> 00:22:19.150
know about this.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:22.050
But Googlers hate this feature
because it basically blocks you

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.950
from all your Googlers.

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:24.630
We use LinkedIn.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.530
JORGE CUETO: And
there are so many.

00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:26.530
AMANDA BRADFORD: I know.

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.440
Well, basically, Google
and Facebook hate us.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.940
And everyone else
is like, thank you

00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.880
for not matching me with
my coworker in the cube

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:33.730
next to me.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:35.688
But, yeah, I would say
that feature is probably

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:36.960
pretty hidden.

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.240
Because we ask you to log
in with your LinkedIn, which

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.160
people think is kind
of weird, it actually

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.350
allows us to then block you
from anyone who works with you

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.400
or anyone you're connected to.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:45.160
So I was in sales.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.036
So I was always friending
people on LinkedIn,

00:22:47.036 --> 00:22:48.951
and I did a lot of, like,
business development

00:22:48.951 --> 00:22:49.500
on LinkedIn.

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.240
So the last thing
I wanted to do was

00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.180
see one of the people
I was kind of doing

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:56.190
business deals with on my feed.

00:22:56.190 --> 00:22:56.770
That's weird.

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:59.190
So I was like, let's just
prevent that situation.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.690
So I talked about
that a little bit.

00:23:00.690 --> 00:23:04.560
But that one not
everyone knows about.

00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:06.206
And then I would say
you can also sort.

00:23:06.206 --> 00:23:07.830
So I come from the
CRM industry, right?

00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.440
So when I look at the
match screen of the League,

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.630
everyone's like, there's
so much data there.

00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:15.750
And I'm like, well,
as a CRM person,

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:18.689
you want to see all of the
information kind of condensed

00:23:18.689 --> 00:23:19.980
in, like, an executive summary.

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:22.170
So if you look at
our match screen,

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:24.780
I'm, like, the only one on the
team that likes that screen.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:25.920
But I like it
because it shows you

00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.128
all the information you need.

00:23:27.128 --> 00:23:29.520
And you can actually sort
your matches by least flaky,

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:32.350
most popular, most recent,
and then your best match.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:33.850
And a lot of people
don't know that.

00:23:33.850 --> 00:23:37.050
But the best match algorithm
is actually pretty good,

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:38.910
and no one uses that, either.

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:40.980
So those are the
under-marketed--

00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.377
I would call them under-marketed
features in the app

00:23:43.377 --> 00:23:45.210
because we haven't done
much to kind of tell

00:23:45.210 --> 00:23:46.380
the users about them.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:51.410
JORGE CUETO: In terms of
the League sort of brand

00:23:51.410 --> 00:23:53.580
that the League
has, do you think

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.760
that that could
potentially also lead

00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:59.580
to maybe inadequate matches?

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:01.080
Because I think
that a lot of times,

00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:04.620
people might find that they're
really compatible with someone

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:09.180
who doesn't necessarily come
from the same, like, high-level

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.040
social class background
that they do,

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.580
that there's cross-social-class
relationships.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.195
AMANDA BRADFORD: Well,
statistically, that's not true.

00:24:18.195 --> 00:24:20.220
Like I always like to
say, everything's a proxy,

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:22.060
and your V1 is never
going to be perfect.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.840
So you have to just ignore
some of the outlying use cases.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.340
It's like product
management, right?

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:29.190
So that's sort of the
way I think about it,

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:30.990
is that I looked at
statistically who is

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:32.550
getting married to each other.

00:24:32.550 --> 00:24:35.520
Similar age, similar
education level, and actually

00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:38.020
similar industry is
highly significant.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.300
So I guess you can either
try to go with the data

00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:43.590
or go against the data.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.084
But I think for
us, if it's already

00:24:45.084 --> 00:24:46.500
happening in the
real world, we're

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:49.380
just trying to create a software
platform that facilitates that.

00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:50.595
We're not trying to sort of--

00:24:50.595 --> 00:24:51.970
I mean, eventually,
yeah, maybe I

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:53.700
do want to change what people
are doing in the real world.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:55.410
I think that's when you
start to have influence.

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:56.826
When you're a
company like Google,

00:24:56.826 --> 00:25:00.120
you can actually start to
really make change in society

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.360
and how people are
using software.

00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:04.950
But I think at
our stage, we just

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.680
want to be able to get to
that point and give our users

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.770
what they need, what they're
kind of coming to our door for.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:11.820
So I don't know.

00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:13.800
I guess I look at
it as we're kind

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.950
of using math and data to
give you kind of the best

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:19.600
probability of someone
you would match with,

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.511
and we're not kind
of trying to change

00:25:22.511 --> 00:25:23.760
the data set that we're using.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.590
We're trying to use the data
set that people have researched

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:28.410
for 20 or 30 years and apply
it in, like, a smarter way.

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:31.290
So eventually, I want to
have my own research team

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.277
and kind of maybe debunk some of
this stuff or find out how to--

00:25:35.277 --> 00:25:37.110
you know, I think we
always talk about that.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:41.394
You know, the creatives that
never meet the finance people,

00:25:41.394 --> 00:25:43.560
how do we make sure that
they're both kind of coming

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.170
into the community
on equal amounts?

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.137
And it's a challenge.

00:25:47.137 --> 00:25:48.720
We have way more
finance people coming

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.540
into the New York community
than creatives or people

00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:53.170
on Broadway.

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.770
I think that's just, A, a
fact of New York population

00:25:55.770 --> 00:25:58.510
but, B, a little bit
of a fact of life.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.510
And it is going to
be harder for that

00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:02.140
match to happen in
the real world, too.

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:03.514
So shouldn't it
be kind of harder

00:26:03.514 --> 00:26:05.030
for it to happen
on a dating app?

00:26:05.030 --> 00:26:05.430
So I don't know.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:06.750
I guess we try to
think that we're

00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:08.875
kind of mimicking the real
world and making it more

00:26:08.875 --> 00:26:14.430
efficient and useful and
not trying to kind of tell

00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:16.242
people what they
should or shouldn't

00:26:16.242 --> 00:26:17.200
be doing at this point.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.908
But we do kick people
out if they're bad.

00:26:18.908 --> 00:26:22.810
So we do make sure
people are respectful.

00:26:22.810 --> 00:26:25.120
So that's one thing we're
pretty hard and fast on.

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.534
But as far as whether they're
swiping or being super picky,

00:26:28.534 --> 00:26:29.700
I mean, we give them advice.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:31.560
But if people want
to be picky and say

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.170
no to every single person we
give them for a whole year

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:37.182
and then complain, you
can't please everybody,

00:26:37.182 --> 00:26:37.890
as you guys know.

00:26:37.890 --> 00:26:40.096
Product managers, you
always have that email

00:26:40.096 --> 00:26:41.220
that keeps you up at night.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:43.740
And we just had one.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.660
It was actually a
72-year-old lesbian woman

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:48.330
who was very mad at me
because we didn't have anyone

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:49.290
to give her.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:50.970
And we refunded her.

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:53.760
But I did research.

00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:56.130
And I was like, what if we
did an advertising campaign

00:26:56.130 --> 00:26:56.810
to get--

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.070
and then I was like,
this is not-- you

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:59.340
know, at the end of the
day, especially when

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.040
you're running a company,
you've got to cut that 20% off.

00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.620
I cannot be worrying about the
72-year-old lesbian right now

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:07.500
when we have 30-year-olds
maybe running out of matches.

00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.770
That's way more
critical of a problem.

00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.420
So it's all kind of triage.

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.150
And I think a lot of the
questions that go into

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.030
things we want to do when we
have more people on staff are,

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.556
yes, educating people on why
you should be open-minded

00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:22.680
and why you shouldn't reject
people when they're 5'

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.780
9" instead of 5' 10".

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.090
And I have a lot of, like,
blog posts saved up in me

00:27:27.090 --> 00:27:30.420
that I want to help
people kind of to optimize

00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:31.200
their dating life.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.867
But first, we've got to
kind of get the product out.

00:27:33.867 --> 00:27:35.700
JORGE CUETO: In terms
of growth, another one

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.860
of the opportunities
could be expanding more

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.990
into the LGBT community.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:42.864
So have you thought
about ways to do that?

00:27:42.864 --> 00:27:44.280
What's the
distribution right now?

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.238
AMANDA BRADFORD: We do.

00:27:45.238 --> 00:27:47.560
We have a great LGBT
community in New York

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.300
and actually a really
good one in London.

00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.870
It's weirdly disproportionate.

00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:54.720
But we haven't done
any targeted marketing.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:57.360
It's been all word
of mouth through that

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.370
because actually on
Facebook, you can only

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.330
target straight people.

00:28:00.330 --> 00:28:04.860
Or they make you have a
separate campaign for each one.

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:09.290
So that's been a pretty
viral community for us.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.000
So, yeah, I think as
we think about where

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.810
to spend in marketing, it's
definitely investing in LGBT,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.730
I think, because they
also spend a lot, too.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:25.320
So I would say our LGBT
and the New York finance,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.250
they both are kind of one
of our better customers.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.070
So we definitely want to learn
how to kind of market to them

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:34.119
and acquire them more scalably.

00:28:34.119 --> 00:28:35.910
JORGE CUETO: I want to
go back a little bit

00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:41.047
to the filtering by
education level and job,

00:28:41.047 --> 00:28:42.630
because something I
was thinking about

00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:44.280
was that you're
using this as a proxy

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:48.300
for determining whether someone
is driven, right, in some ways.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:49.882
But there's cases
where people could

00:28:49.882 --> 00:28:51.840
be driven or really
passionate about something,

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.450
but don't necessarily
have the education level.

00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:55.340
AMANDA BRADFORD: Right,
it doesn't come out, like,

00:28:55.340 --> 00:28:55.980
on paper as much.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:57.720
JORGE CUETO: So potentially,
you could be an artist,

00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.080
and you're really
passionate about that

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.090
and are a great artist.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:02.756
But in terms of
education and job,

00:29:02.756 --> 00:29:04.380
that might not be
shown in your resume,

00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.970
or you might not
have a LinkedIn page.

00:29:05.970 --> 00:29:07.680
So have you thought
about other things

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.019
that you can use as proxies
to get at that sentiment?

00:29:10.019 --> 00:29:12.060
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah, we
talked a lot about that

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.774
because LinkedIn is
going to become--

00:29:13.774 --> 00:29:14.940
right now, LinkedIn is fine.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.070
And it's sort of serving
as a natural curation

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:20.010
mechanism for us because if you
don't have a LinkedIn account,

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.300
you drop off at that point.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.716
So we almost didn't even have
to deal with the people that

00:29:23.716 --> 00:29:25.500
don't have LinkedIn accounts.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.940
But a lot of those
are creatives.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.519
And so when we launched
LA, we had a big problem

00:29:29.519 --> 00:29:31.560
because a lot of people
in LA don't use LinkedIn.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.240
It's kind of not cool.

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.339
If you're a cool
person in the industry,

00:29:35.339 --> 00:29:36.630
you're not on LinkedIn, really.

00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:39.420
So we ended up
building a new flow

00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.130
so you could pay to skip it.

00:29:41.130 --> 00:29:42.830
And then for LA,
when we launched,

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:44.880
we ended up kind of
comping a lot of people

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.372
to get through that kind of
original LinkedIn screen.

00:29:48.372 --> 00:29:50.330
I think as we think about
international, that's

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:51.871
going to be a huge
issue for us, too,

00:29:51.871 --> 00:29:53.580
because not everyone
internationally

00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.382
is kind of as LinkedIn focused.

00:29:55.382 --> 00:29:56.340
It's very white collar.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.906
So as you get into kind of
the creative, the producers,

00:29:59.906 --> 00:30:00.780
they're not on there.

00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:03.090
They might be on IMDB.

00:30:03.090 --> 00:30:06.120
So we talked about
Amex has an API login.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.820
So we're kind of brainstorming
with some different ways

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:13.740
to kind of start to get outside
of our core LinkedIn, like,

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.330
white collar demographic.

00:30:15.330 --> 00:30:17.040
But I would say
that LinkedIn does

00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:18.250
have a pretty big audience.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.160
So I think for
short term, we want

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.974
to just get at least the
LinkedIn users in those cities

00:30:22.974 --> 00:30:23.640
that we're live.

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:25.475
And then step two
is let's get people

00:30:25.475 --> 00:30:26.850
that don't have
LinkedIn accounts

00:30:26.850 --> 00:30:28.440
and figure out how
to get them in.

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.330
JORGE CUETO: I think there are
a lot of professional networks

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.010
that are sort of more targeted.

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.010
I think there is
also one for doctors.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:35.176
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah,
there's Doximity for doctors.

00:30:35.176 --> 00:30:36.120
So we talked to them.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.832
That's probably one we'll
do next year, is Doximity.

00:30:38.832 --> 00:30:40.290
AUDIENCE: If you
can talk about how

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:42.420
you think about user
retention, because it seems

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.640
like if people are
really successful, then

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.800
they may just turn off
the platform very quickly.

00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.300
And then on the other
hand, if they really

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:49.620
hate the experience,
they'll turn off quickly.

00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:52.140
But there's, like, this sweet
spot of people who are maybe

00:30:52.140 --> 00:30:54.390
a little bit frustrated
somehow but enjoy the platform

00:30:54.390 --> 00:30:56.556
and will stay on it for a
long time and spend money.

00:30:56.556 --> 00:30:58.050
So when people
churn, how do you--

00:30:58.050 --> 00:30:59.758
AMANDA BRADFORD: Like,
good churn and bad

00:30:59.758 --> 00:31:03.770
churn, yeah, so we call it
good churn and bad churn.

00:31:03.770 --> 00:31:06.020
We keep our names
pretty simple here.

00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:09.900
But, yeah, we are
excited about good churn.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.681
I think that worrying
about good churn

00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:14.930
is like worrying about someone
stealing your idea when

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.679
you're an entrepreneur.

00:31:16.679 --> 00:31:19.220
That means your product is doing
the job that it was designed

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.800
to do, and hopefully
you can kind of

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:24.080
be smart enough to build a
business model around that,

00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.150
to support that job
that it's doing.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:27.609
So we don't worry
about good churn.

00:31:27.609 --> 00:31:29.733
And I like to think that
every good churn is, like,

00:31:29.733 --> 00:31:30.590
five new users.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.561
In my head, I think of
that, because if they

00:31:32.561 --> 00:31:35.060
tell their friends, or they say
it at the marriage ceremony,

00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:38.750
or by just how viral
dating is in general,

00:31:38.750 --> 00:31:40.610
people say where they met.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:45.350
So if everybody did
good churn right away,

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:47.090
that would be an
amazing problem to have.

00:31:47.090 --> 00:31:48.840
Bad churn is not good.

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:51.440
And bad churn typically happens
when people don't get matches.

00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.456
And that is related
to either pickiness.

00:31:53.456 --> 00:31:54.830
So they're saying
no to everyone.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:57.740
They're really just not
happy with the selection.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:01.190
Or they're very low-performing,
and everyone says no to them.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:03.582
So that's sort of
the two use cases.

00:32:03.582 --> 00:32:05.540
Or there's a bunch of
people in the middle that

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:08.870
are kind of, sort of picky,
not really, but also not really

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:11.097
happy, not getting
a ton of matches.

00:32:11.097 --> 00:32:13.430
So, yeah, there's a lot of
different kind of experiences

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:14.704
people can have on the app.

00:32:14.704 --> 00:32:17.120
And I think that's one of the
hardest parts of the product

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:20.557
management for it, is
that you kind of have--

00:32:20.557 --> 00:32:22.640
we're just now doing kind
of cohorts and segments.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.130
But, like, the older
people do churn faster.

00:32:27.344 --> 00:32:29.510
It's almost like you have
so many different customer

00:32:29.510 --> 00:32:32.646
segments to model that it
gets a little bit confusing.

00:32:32.646 --> 00:32:34.520
So what we've started
to do is now just focus

00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.020
on our target, our sweet spot.

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:38.270
All our revenue, our user
growth, our referrals

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:41.140
are all, like, 25 to 36
is sort of our sweet spot.

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:44.330
So we're really focusing
on in that cohort,

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:45.620
are we getting bad churn?

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:47.411
And we don't want bad
churn in that cohort.

00:32:47.411 --> 00:32:49.269
But in the other cohorts,
we're kind of OK,

00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:51.560
because they're a little bit
outside of our sweet spot.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:55.110
So kind of just being
super focused on--

00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:57.560
and if the people churned
out, why they did.

00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:58.910
And you can kind of see.

00:32:58.910 --> 00:33:02.090
The cool thing about just
having all the data is you

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:04.190
can literally see someone's
exact experience, who

00:33:04.190 --> 00:33:06.080
they saw, if they liked them.

00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.514
Maybe they saw a
terrible profile

00:33:07.514 --> 00:33:08.930
and, like, disabled
their account.

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.305
You can actually
go and see that.

00:33:10.305 --> 00:33:13.590
So you can kind of track back
what caused users to churn.

00:33:13.590 --> 00:33:18.050
And it usually is, for
us, a lack of matches.

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.660
That's why we're so focused
on improving the algorithm,

00:33:20.660 --> 00:33:23.075
because that's going to
increase retention a ton.

00:33:23.075 --> 00:33:24.450
If you get one
good match a week,

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:25.940
you're going to stay on,
even if it's only one.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.980
But if we're not giving
you one for three weeks,

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:29.000
you're going to churn.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.900
So for us, that's optimizing
the algorithm better to make

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.290
sure you're not getting--

00:33:34.290 --> 00:33:36.020
you know, you're
getting good matches,

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:38.120
and you're not getting them
all at once, at the beginning,

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:39.161
and burning through them.

00:33:39.161 --> 00:33:41.060
So that's sort of the
other game theory part.

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:43.045
I think it gets into
ethics a little bit.

00:33:43.045 --> 00:33:45.670
Do you give everyone their best
matches right at the beginning?

00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.540
Or do you sprinkle in
different offerings

00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:51.470
so that you always
are liking the guy we

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:52.550
think you should like?

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.060
When you only have a
hundred or a couple

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:57.980
of thousand people signed up
in a city, who do you let in?

00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.570
Right now, we've
started moving into

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:03.230
an entirely, like, predictive,
model-based selection, where

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.456
rather than us being
like, oh, you'd

00:34:05.456 --> 00:34:07.580
be good for the brand--
you went to a great school,

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.500
you have a great profile, like,
let's put you in-- instead,

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.542
we actually look and see.

00:34:10.542 --> 00:34:12.499
Do their preferences
overlap with other people?

00:34:12.499 --> 00:34:14.449
And are they going to
have a good time inside?

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:16.886
Because if the girl only
likes 60-year-old men,

00:34:16.886 --> 00:34:18.469
and we don't have
any 60-year-old men,

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:20.574
she's not going to have
a good time at the party

00:34:20.574 --> 00:34:21.199
is what we say.

00:34:21.199 --> 00:34:23.449
So it's interesting
because you can

00:34:23.449 --> 00:34:25.880
start to kind of almost
launch with people

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.290
that you are predicting
are going to find a match.

00:34:28.290 --> 00:34:30.414
So now we're almost predicting
matches, like, weeks

00:34:30.414 --> 00:34:32.445
in advance of when
we launch the cities.

00:34:32.445 --> 00:34:34.070
And we're only
launching with people we

00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:35.729
think are going to get a match.

00:34:35.729 --> 00:34:37.520
So, yeah, it's a totally
different strategy

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:39.440
than kind of before when
it was very guesswork.

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:40.969
And like, oh, these
are people that we

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:42.350
think were going to match,
but it was very human.

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:44.120
And now it's
completely data-driven,

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:45.651
based on their pickiness.

00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:47.150
Well, if it's a
brand-new user, it's

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:49.190
based on just users
that resemble them

00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:50.852
and what they've
seen in the past.

00:34:50.852 --> 00:34:53.060
And we can kind of predict
what the behavior is going

00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:55.899
to be once we launch the city.

00:34:55.899 --> 00:34:57.440
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about how

00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:01.210
you choose what's a good
education selectivity,

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.820
if it's level or school,
because I know in 2013,

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.340
actually, Laszlo came out
and said that GPA was totally

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:10.310
agnostic to Googler success.

00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:12.185
So it actually wasn't
indicative of anything.

00:35:12.185 --> 00:35:14.476
The only thing he said that
was in "The New York Times"

00:35:14.476 --> 00:35:16.020
was conversation
and interviewing.

00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:19.430
And so given that
a lot of schools--

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:21.560
you know, you can make
arguments that some schools

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.380
are better than others.

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.290
But also there's a lot of
industry-specific knowledge

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:25.140
that comes from
particular schools.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:28.040
AMANDA BRADFORD: For sure, so
we value profession just as

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:28.880
high as education.

00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.130
AUDIENCE: So is the education,
like, what school you go to

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.150
or what level of education?

00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:33.691
AMANDA BRADFORD:
We're program-based.

00:35:33.691 --> 00:35:35.335
AUDIENCE: So, what
metric do you--

00:35:35.335 --> 00:35:36.960
AMANDA BRADFORD: Like
a medical school,

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.510
so if you went to any medical
school in the United States,

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:39.926
that's considered
highly selective

00:35:39.926 --> 00:35:41.850
in our tiering system.

00:35:41.850 --> 00:35:43.600
AUDIENCE: So for the
particular undergrad,

00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.370
you're like, oh, this is an Ivy
League school, versus this is--

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:48.380
AMANDA BRADFORD: So we
have three categories.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.690
We call a school highly
selective, selective,

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:51.800
or it's just not tagged.

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:52.530
AUDIENCE: I see.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:53.720
So you mark every school.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:57.560
AMANDA BRADFORD: And program,
so for instance, like you said,

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:00.460
a doctor, if you're
in a doctors program

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.080
at University of Alabama,
that is highly selective.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.780
You're studying to
be a doctor, right?

00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:06.407
So it's program-based.

00:36:06.407 --> 00:36:08.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK, so
that was my question,

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.095
was how do you approach
that algorithmically?

00:36:11.095 --> 00:36:12.470
AMANDA BRADFORD:
Well, we haven't

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.340
done anything super cool yet.

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:16.880
But right now, it's sort
of in, like, V2 stage,

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:22.511
where we sort of have
the data set tagged.

00:36:22.511 --> 00:36:24.260
But it's not very
international right now,

00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:26.720
so we're kind of adding in
more international programs.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.400
And now we're in
London and Toronto.

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.424
So we learned a lot
of, oh, we didn't have

00:36:30.424 --> 00:36:31.590
this school in our database.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:33.170
So now, we're kind
of crowdsourcing

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:34.580
a bunch of the schools
and the programs.

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.538
And everyone writes them
a little bit different

00:36:36.538 --> 00:36:37.920
on LinkedIn, so
it's not perfect.

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.780
But we can look for the
word MD or something

00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.480
to show that they are kind of
investing in higher education.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.580
And that's sort of the way we're
trying to kind of proxy it.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.110
And I like to think of the
education as it's less of a--

00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:52.640
I think people use
it is as a proxy

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.640
for, like, I wouldn't
say ambition.

00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:59.907
I guess the way people
I've seen use it--

00:36:59.907 --> 00:37:02.240
I've actually watched different
people use the filters--

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:05.564
and it is definitely for
people with graduate degrees.

00:37:05.564 --> 00:37:06.980
The only people
that care about it

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.438
are the ones with
graduate degrees.

00:37:08.438 --> 00:37:10.190
And I think it is
because they tend

00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:12.240
to want to find someone
that shares their values

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:14.210
and that is in their
kind of industry.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.780
So we did an analysis on who
actually uses the education

00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.590
filter.

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:20.390
And it's usually
people in their 30s

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:23.210
and with a graduate
degree, doctor, lawyer,

00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:25.226
something like that.

00:37:25.226 --> 00:37:27.320
But, yeah, it's
interesting to see, like,

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.990
who uses these and who doesn't.

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:32.587
It's pretty interesting.

00:37:32.587 --> 00:37:33.920
We should write a book sometime.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:35.720
But the good news is,
though, if anyone's

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.261
read "Dataclysm," which was kind
of the last big book written

00:37:38.261 --> 00:37:40.840
about online dating, we want to
kind of do an update to that.

00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:43.340
But the good news is a lot of
the kind of terrible trends he

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:47.030
talks about, which is still
true across the board in dating,

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:48.230
they are getting better.

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:49.730
People are getting
more open-minded.

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.729
People are getting less
racist on online dating.

00:37:51.729 --> 00:37:54.440
People are getting less
heightist, less elitist.

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.680
We've noticed it in our data,
even in the past three years.

00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:59.990
People are becoming more
open-minded on online dating.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:01.710
And it's a shift
that takes time.

00:38:01.710 --> 00:38:04.100
So I think as much as
we can be mad about it

00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.345
and hate the space, I think
it is improving these products

00:38:07.345 --> 00:38:09.470
using more authentication,
getting more information

00:38:09.470 --> 00:38:10.095
about the user.

00:38:10.095 --> 00:38:12.830
I think it is helping us as
a society kind of make better

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:14.030
matches for ourselves.

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:15.446
So I would disagree
with the point

00:38:15.446 --> 00:38:19.044
that it's causing people
to be more elitist.

00:38:19.044 --> 00:38:21.710
I actually think, because you're
able to see all of these people

00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:23.168
that you weren't
able to see before

00:38:23.168 --> 00:38:26.840
in your homogeneous
Google life or whatever--

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:30.180
my life, you know, I took
one bus back and forth.

00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:32.070
So I didn't get out
of my comfort zone.

00:38:33.482 --> 00:38:34.940
And a study just
came out actually,

00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:40.309
that online dating is actually
widening people's preferences.

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:42.350
And also there's a lot
more interracial marriages

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:44.808
happening just because of the
surge of online dating, which

00:38:44.808 --> 00:38:48.424
they are attributing it
100% to online dating.

00:38:48.424 --> 00:38:49.340
So that just came out.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.017
And I'll send you
guys to follow up.

00:38:51.017 --> 00:38:53.350
But that just came out in, I
think, "The New York Times"

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.360
or something, about how online
dating is resulting in kind

00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.345
of a more open-minded society.

00:39:01.050 --> 00:39:03.770
JORGE CUETO: I'll do a
question from the Dory,

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.050
from someone who's watching
in the live stream.

00:39:06.050 --> 00:39:07.970
"You keep using
the term singles,

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:10.040
but open relationships
and polyamory

00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.240
are becoming more and
more prevalent nowadays."

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.620
Does the League explicitly
try to avoid such users?

00:39:15.620 --> 00:39:17.840
It doesn't seem to
discriminate against singles

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:20.390
in open relationships
but does have a bias

00:39:20.390 --> 00:39:21.920
against openly married.

00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.830
What's your take?

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.862
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:39:24.862 --> 00:39:26.320
I think when we
launched, we wanted

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:28.344
to be really clear about
what the product was

00:39:28.344 --> 00:39:30.260
and what the brand was,
what the offering was.

00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:34.450
So it was for people looking for
long or serious relationships,

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:36.590
soulmates, life partners.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.820
It wasn't for casual sex.

00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:40.790
And it wasn't for a person in
an open relationship trying

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:44.540
to find another person
to add to their people.

00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.999
So it was a very kind of
core focused-use case.

00:39:47.999 --> 00:39:49.790
Like I said, I was
designing it for myself.

00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:52.220
To me, that wasn't going to
help me solve my problem.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:55.880
So I designed it to
speak very clearly

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:57.170
about why you should be there.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:00.320
I think we've kicked
out a couple of people

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:03.140
that were married and using
it for open relationships.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:07.909
And I think the way I
think about it is there are

00:40:07.909 --> 00:40:09.200
a ton of dating apps out there.

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.530
And it's getting more and
more nice and fragmented

00:40:12.530 --> 00:40:13.670
and use-case specific.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.580
So I think that I
can even name some

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:19.160
that are designed for three-ways
or designed for polyamory.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.010
So I think that
instead of trying

00:40:21.010 --> 00:40:22.760
to be everything to
everyone, why don't we

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:26.180
just get really good at
the demographic we have

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.700
and assume that someone
else will kind of take

00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.170
that opportunity, I guess?

00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:32.086
One thing I've learned
in the last three years

00:40:32.086 --> 00:40:33.770
is you can't go after
every opportunity.

00:40:33.770 --> 00:40:35.690
You're going to burn
out, and I have.

00:40:35.690 --> 00:40:38.181
So you have to make
hard decisions.

00:40:38.181 --> 00:40:40.430
And I think for us, it's
like, I can't worry about the

00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:41.180
over 40 year olds.

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.014
And I can't worry
about the polyamorous

00:40:45.014 --> 00:40:47.180
and the open relationship
people because they're not

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:50.865
contributing meaningfully
to actually our core

00:40:50.865 --> 00:40:53.240
business that we're building,
our core company that we're

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:53.780
building.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.510
So it's like you have to support
users that are funding you.

00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:58.160
And then let's build
them a product.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:00.470
And then if we can
kind of get that right,

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.140
then there's a lot more products
and people to build for.

00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:04.640
So I kind of think
of that as, like,

00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.980
when we have an R&amp;D
department, sure.

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:10.354
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:41:10.354 --> 00:41:11.270
AMANDA BRADFORD: Sure.

00:41:11.270 --> 00:41:14.810
AUDIENCE: How do
you get started?

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.835
I heard you say you
got four people.

00:41:16.835 --> 00:41:20.180
And how did you get those three
other people on board with you?

00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:25.180
And it looks like LinkedIn is
kind of critical to this app.

00:41:25.180 --> 00:41:27.860
And how did you get
partnership with them?

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.960
And were you worried?

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:32.740
Is it open API or
something like--

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.057
if they're going to
withdraw that at some point?

00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:36.890
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah,
it's a good question.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.620
The LinkedIn thing
is interesting, now

00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:40.494
that they're bought by
Microsoft, especially.

00:41:40.494 --> 00:41:43.799
But we were, like, the
first one to use them.

00:41:43.799 --> 00:41:44.840
And they were like, what?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:46.400
A dating site wants to use us?

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.930
I was like, you guys have the
best data set in the world.

00:41:48.930 --> 00:41:50.096
Of course, I want to use it.

00:41:50.096 --> 00:41:54.500
So we kind of got grandfathered
in because people were actually

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:56.000
creating LinkedIn
accounts to join

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.640
our app, which is really
high friction when

00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.940
you're paying for a user.

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:00.770
You're like, what?

00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:04.710
So we're giving them users in a
sense, because people are like,

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:05.210
oh.

00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.790
I need a LinkedIn account.

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:06.623
I don't want to pay.

00:42:06.623 --> 00:42:09.610
So I'll go create a LinkedIn
account and then authenticate.

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.860
So I think they saw that there's
clear benefit in new users.

00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:15.320
So we kind of
positioned it that way,

00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.732
as we'll be giving
you new leads.

00:42:17.732 --> 00:42:19.940
And we're not going to do
anything spammy or anything

00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:20.440
weird.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:23.210
We're just literally
displaying the data.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:26.180
But they actually have cut
off their API access now,

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.860
the public profile view.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.870
So we actually are
grandfathered into, like,

00:42:29.870 --> 00:42:31.910
a pretty nice little
moat, I guess.

00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:35.330
We have some extra
API permissions.

00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:36.995
Your other question was about--

00:42:36.995 --> 00:42:38.950
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah,
the three other people.

00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:39.460
AMANDA BRADFORD: Oh, starting?

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:40.400
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:41.680
AMANDA BRADFORD: So, yeah,
the starting was funny.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.950
This is why now we're
doing these small cities.

00:42:43.950 --> 00:42:46.649
I'm having, like, flashbacks
to when I was in San Francisco

00:42:46.649 --> 00:42:49.190
and literally going door to door
and knocking and being like,

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.970
do you know any single people?

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:53.290
Can you text them right now?

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.730
And I need, like, 200 more
people so we can launch.

00:42:55.730 --> 00:42:58.740
So what I did is I set myself a
goal of, like, 300 guys and 300

00:42:58.740 --> 00:42:59.240
girls.

00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:02.660
And we actually built it
into the wait list screen,

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:05.780
a little progress bar of how
many more women and men were

00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:10.610
needed to get to the 300,
which it was kind of overkill,

00:43:10.610 --> 00:43:13.820
I guess, of a feature because
it was only pertinent from 0

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:14.390
to 300.

00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:16.620
And then it was sort of
outdated at that point.

00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.790
But it took a long time to get
from 0 to 300 in each gender

00:43:19.790 --> 00:43:20.810
category.

00:43:20.810 --> 00:43:23.750
But, yeah, that was sort of the
goal, was once we got to 300,

00:43:23.750 --> 00:43:25.640
we were going to launch
and see if it worked.

00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.980
And that's obviously a
very small number of users.

00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.010
So that was also why there's
only three to five potentials

00:43:31.010 --> 00:43:32.910
given every day, because
I was like, well,

00:43:32.910 --> 00:43:35.480
how do we launch
this, because it was

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:37.430
in the era of unlimited swipes?

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:40.590
And Tinder was giving everybody
as many as you wanted.

00:43:40.590 --> 00:43:43.070
So we actually kind
of stole, not stole,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:45.660
I guess pulled a page out of
Coffee Meets Bagel and Hinge's

00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.582
book because they were doing
the kind of daily batch thing.

00:43:48.582 --> 00:43:50.540
And I was like, well,
let's do that and make it

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.100
more fun, like happy hour.

00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:55.130
And so that's why we
give only three to five

00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:58.370
a day, so that we don't have
to be concerned about supply

00:43:58.370 --> 00:44:01.320
issues, especially upon launch,
because some of the people

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.580
were launching.

00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.481
I think we only had, like,
100 people ready to show them.

00:44:05.481 --> 00:44:07.230
And then we are kind
of betting that we'll

00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:08.180
be acquiring more people.

00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:08.940
And they'll be coming in.

00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:10.590
And so you have
to kind of figure

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:13.860
out how much of an archive,
or I guess backlog,

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:17.020
you have to kind of create
first before you launch

00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.270
so you know how many you need.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.280
So we found that
it's about 300 guys

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.830
and 300 girls is sort
of the minimum you

00:44:22.830 --> 00:44:27.060
need, because you have to assume
that, like, 70% might log in.

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.700
And then of the ones that
log in, some might be picky.

00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.500
So you kind of want
to make sure that you

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.090
have enough people
that actually had

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.464
a good experience at the end
of that kind of first launch

00:44:35.464 --> 00:44:37.070
experience.

00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:40.620
AUDIENCE: OK, so the first
question kind of piggybacks off

00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.370
what you just mentioned,
and the other one

00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:44.210
is completely different.

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.090
So how did you guys originally
get to that number, 300,

00:44:47.090 --> 00:44:48.410
for each?

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:50.570
AMANDA BRADFORD: It's
kind of random, I guess.

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:52.476
Yeah, I think a couple
of different ways.

00:44:52.476 --> 00:44:53.600
We kind of triangulated it.

00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:56.154
So one was that was
just the number I picked

00:44:56.154 --> 00:44:57.320
for launching San Francisco.

00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.460
So that was me being very,
I guess, you know, cursory.

00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:04.824
And then the second piece
was we did this model that

00:45:04.824 --> 00:45:06.740
predicts how many happy
people are going to be

00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:08.750
in a cohort on a wait list.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:12.560
So we can see in Indianapolis,
there's 438 people of the,

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.230
like, 2,000 that we predict will
have a good time in the party.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:19.427
So it's a little bit
of how many people

00:45:19.427 --> 00:45:21.260
do you need to make
sure there's going to be

00:45:21.260 --> 00:45:23.310
a good amount of happy users.

00:45:23.310 --> 00:45:24.920
So that's sort of
where that 300 comes

00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.820
from because we found that
if there's at least 400

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:30.515
is about the right happy users.

00:45:30.515 --> 00:45:33.080
So then you assume not
all of them log in.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.850
And so that's where you get
to kind of about 300, 300.

00:45:35.850 --> 00:45:38.300
AUDIENCE: OK, cool,
and question two

00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:41.505
is you mentioned that you did
an incubator through the nights.

00:45:41.794 --> 00:45:42.710
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:44.330
AUDIENCE: After you
were working here?

00:45:44.330 --> 00:45:45.290
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah,
it was with Google.

00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:47.915
I was at the SF office there, so
it was easier to commit to it.

00:45:47.915 --> 00:45:50.060
But it was Women 2.0 put it on.

00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:51.940
But it was for men and women.

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.175
It was just called--

00:45:53.175 --> 00:45:54.050
now I can't remember.

00:45:54.050 --> 00:45:55.290
It was just called, like a--

00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:59.060
I don't know-- innovation
program or something.

00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.830
But, yeah, it was cool,
just because it got you

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:02.700
in the motion.

00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:04.202
But it wasn't your day job.

00:46:04.202 --> 00:46:05.160
Everyone had a day job.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.840
So it was a little
bit less intense.

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.080
And you got to kind of try
your hand at it without having

00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.100
a ton of pressure.

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.183
AUDIENCE: OK, because that
was the other question,

00:46:13.183 --> 00:46:15.309
was how did you manage
doing that and working here.

00:46:15.808 --> 00:46:17.910
AMANDA BRADFORD: Oh, yeah,
well, I didn't really--

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:20.050
no, I worked hard at Google.

00:46:20.050 --> 00:46:22.110
So I just worked a lot.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.130
That was one of the reasons
why I had relationship issues,

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:28.050
because I was working so hard.

00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:30.030
So it all comes back, right?

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:32.170
It all comes back full circle.

00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:34.320
But, yeah, I think I
just tried to balance it.

00:46:34.320 --> 00:46:35.370
I did a lot of that
on the weekends.

00:46:35.370 --> 00:46:37.703
That would be almost my whole
weekend, would be on that.

00:46:37.703 --> 00:46:39.570
And then at nights, I
would work till 7:00

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:41.310
and then work on it
from 7:00 to 9:00

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:44.520
in, like, a conference room
here and just hammer it out.

00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:47.646
So that's how I did the GMAT,
to study for the GMAT here, too,

00:46:47.646 --> 00:46:49.830
but, yeah.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.885
JORGE CUETO: We have time
for one more question.

00:46:51.885 --> 00:46:54.000
AMANDA BRADFORD: [INAUDIBLE]
purple back there.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.790
AUDIENCE: On business
school, two things

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:56.520
you learned in
business school that

00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.477
were useful for starting
a startup, after two

00:46:58.477 --> 00:47:00.060
years at Google, did
you feel like you

00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:02.601
needed to go to business school
to leave and start a startup?

00:47:02.601 --> 00:47:05.500
AMANDA BRADFORD: Yeah, it's
a really good question.

00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:08.760
I think if you know you
want to start a startup,

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:12.600
and you get into a top-three
business school, you should go,

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.820
because it's going to help
the process of starting up.

00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:17.885
It's worth the money, I guess.

00:47:17.885 --> 00:47:19.260
If you think about
it just, like,

00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:23.190
as a pure ROI-based argument,
the amount of amazing people

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:26.040
you can get mentored
by, the amount of access

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:30.549
to funding environment,
you're paying for opportunity.

00:47:30.549 --> 00:47:33.090
You're paying for opportunity
to kind of be presented to you.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:35.260
So I think if that's it.

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:38.220
But I think once you get out
of the, like, top one or two

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:40.020
or three programs,
then I think it

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.896
becomes a lot about
what are you going

00:47:41.896 --> 00:47:44.520
to learn that is going to change
the trajectory of your career.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.499
I guess a lot of our funding
came from connections

00:47:51.499 --> 00:47:52.290
I made at Stanford.

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:54.640
So that's why I can't
with a straight face

00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.220
say I didn't need to go.

00:47:56.220 --> 00:48:00.690
But did I use anything I
learned from business school?

00:48:00.690 --> 00:48:02.700
I feel like I knew
what I didn't know.

00:48:05.032 --> 00:48:06.490
Because we studied
entrepreneurship

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:07.364
for, like, two years.

00:48:07.364 --> 00:48:10.230
So you've heard enough horror
stories and terrible stories.

00:48:10.230 --> 00:48:12.189
You kind of know that
you need to hire someone,

00:48:12.189 --> 00:48:14.188
or you know you should
be doing this as a model.

00:48:14.188 --> 00:48:16.780
Or you know you should be
doing more data analysis there.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.930
So you kind of know your
blind spots a little bit.

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:22.170
So I think you can kind of run
your company better because you

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:23.280
have that knowledge.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:24.863
But I don't think
it's, like, a huge--

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:30.570
besides the access to funding,
and obviously the network

00:48:30.570 --> 00:48:35.002
that helped us launch
the League specifically,

00:48:35.002 --> 00:48:36.960
because there's a lot of
Stanford people on it.

00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:38.220
But, yeah, I don't know.

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:40.761
I guess I would say, if you know
you want to start a company,

00:48:40.761 --> 00:48:42.930
and you get into a
place like Stanford,

00:48:42.930 --> 00:48:46.050
they are born and bred
to put entrepreneurs out

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:46.840
into the world.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:49.294
So they're very good at that,
and I felt very confident

00:48:49.294 --> 00:48:50.710
coming out and
starting a company.

00:48:50.710 --> 00:48:53.190
And I think that's hard
to value, that confidence

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:54.120
and the ability to--

00:48:54.120 --> 00:48:56.400
especially as a single founder--

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:57.750
double entendre, I know.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:59.460
But especially as
a single founder,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.070
I think having that degree, even
though it's a little-- like,

00:49:02.070 --> 00:49:04.350
I don't like credentials.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.940
I don't care that
much about pedigree.

00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:09.420
But I do think it helps you
just kind of walk into a room

00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:10.170
and be like, yes.

00:49:10.170 --> 00:49:10.740
I'm fundraising.

00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:13.156
Yes, I'm doing this, and having
people take you seriously.

00:49:13.156 --> 00:49:14.850
So I do think there's
something there

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:17.840
that you have to
give credit for.

00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:23.250
But, I mean, it's an expensive
project, business school.

00:49:23.250 --> 00:49:26.677
So I had a lot of sleepless
nights about it before I went.

00:49:26.677 --> 00:49:28.260
JORGE CUETO: And
with that, time's up.

00:49:28.260 --> 00:49:29.718
So thank you,
everyone, for coming.

00:49:29.718 --> 00:49:31.917
And thank you, Amanda,
for being here with us.

00:49:31.917 --> 00:49:32.120
AMANDA BRADFORD:
Yeah, it was so fun.

00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.036
Great questions, guys.

00:49:33.036 --> 00:49:35.770
