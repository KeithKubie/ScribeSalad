1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,073
You're full

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:04,703
all day,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,160
ladies and gentlemen coming
at you live from paradise.

4
00:00:09,161 --> 00:00:13,660
I'm in Hawaii right now
and uh, I was gonna,

5
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:16,510
I was gonna watch the Bisping fight,

6
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:21,490
the Bisbing Kelvin guest
him fight live and uh,

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,390
do like sort of a breakdown
of it while it was happening.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,510
But the shit was going on at like two
o'clock in the morning out here and

9
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:36,130
it wasn't happening. I have been
eating like a pig and drinking.

10
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:40,720
I've been doing vacation type shit.
I'm a strong believer in that.

11
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:43,990
You need to do vacation time.

12
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:48,010
Like vacation time is important. You
can't just be working all the time.

13
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:53,170
Occasionally you have to just fuck off.
And so that's what I've been doing.

14
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:54,850
I just been fucking off. So I,

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,360
I was tired and I decided I
am not going to stay up late.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,200
And so I watched it in the morning.

17
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,950
I watched it this morning and I've got a
couple of thoughts on it. First of all,

18
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,830
um, Brennan Chub said this on his
Instagram and I could not agree more.

19
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,580
I don't think you should be allowed to
fight three weeks after you have a brutal

20
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,050
fight like Michael Bisping
did with GSP. He got rocked,

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,760
he got choked unconscious,

22
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:29,210
and then three weeks later he's fighting
a really dangerous young and up and

23
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:34,290
coming Kelvin gasoline
and Kelvin is a beast.

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:37,980
He's gotten nasty boxing and that
is what he showed in that fight.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
He hit him with a,

26
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,570
a beautiful straight right jab and a
right hand behind it and Oh my goodness,

27
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:50,040
it was just the kid is just on fire. He's,
he's just on another level right now.

28
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:53,170
I'm, I'm super, super impressed
with Calvin. Kelvin has got

29
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,410
lightning fast hands and he's,

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,440
he's an interesting guy because
he's what I would call a tweener.

31
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,770
And what that means is that I
don't, I mean I think Kelvin

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,773
[inaudible]

33
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,360
in the best, best of times, like if
Kelvin has the best camp and the,

34
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,340
the best performance,

35
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:18,580
it's entirely possible that he
could beat anybody at 185 pounds.

36
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,110
But should he be at 185
pounds? Boy, I don't know,

37
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,560
because Chris Weidman is that 185 pounds.

38
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,660
And when Chris Weidman
got Calvin to the ground,

39
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:31,480
it really did look like you're talking
about two completely different weight

40
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:34,540
classes. And Chris Weidman
was able to choke Kelvin out.

41
00:02:34,541 --> 00:02:39,541
And obviously Weidman is a former champion
and there's absolutely no shame in

42
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:44,320
losing to Chris Weidman,
but it's just the way, um,

43
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,810
it looked when you were
watching the fight,

44
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:51,160
to me it looked like two
different weight classes and, um,

45
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,780
there's a lot of people that think that
really Calvin should be fighting at 170

46
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,250
pounds if he got the proper diet.
And he doing that for a while.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,150
Uh, it w at one point in time he was, uh,

48
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,130
I know Dolce was working
with him for awhile and, uh,

49
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,660
he had his diet in line and
he looked fantastic and then,

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,610
you know, just things happen and he
didn't want to pay the Dolce money.

51
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,720
And, uh,

52
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,510
I dunno who he's working with right
now as a nutritionist, but I just, uh,

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,020
I think he's a phenomenal fighter.

54
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,240
I just don't know if 185 pounds is,
is the right way class for them.

55
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,920
It could be. I mean,

56
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:39,910
it could be that maybe what he really
needs to do is just lose some body fat,

57
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,620
put on some muscle and maybe 185
pounds will be his weight class.

58
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:49,621
It's just that constant debate of whether
or not you should weaken your body and

59
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:57,670
drop down to the minimum weight you can
or whether or not you should fight at a

60
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,780
natural way and have a healthy
body. It's a real good argument.

61
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:05,770
And I'm pausing right now because
I'm pulling something up. Uh,

62
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,790
there's a girl that just died
in Australia. Uh, she died,

63
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,050
um, very recently. Uh,

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,850
she was preparing for a
Moitai fight and it's just,

65
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,830
it's just part of what this
sport is about. Unfortunately.

66
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,000
It really bothers the fucking shit out
of me. I think it's the scariest thing.

67
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,010
Uh, I think, um, yeah. Here
it is. Teenager dies training.

68
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,290
Here it is. Um, the, the girl's name,

69
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,230
she was 18 years old and her name was
Jessica Lindsey and she died while she was

70
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:48,310
cutting weight. She was an amateur
kickboxer in Australia. Um,

71
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:52,630
I cut weight a bunch of times when I was
doing TaeKwonDo tournaments. And, uh,

72
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,950
it is brutal. It's, it's terrible.
I'm, I was bad at it too.

73
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:58,210
I didn't do it correctly.

74
00:04:58,211 --> 00:05:02,710
I just worked out real hard the night
before and wore rubber suits and the whole

75
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:07,450
deal and dehydrated myself. And I
did rehydrate myself well either.

76
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,120
So I felt like shit the next
day when I was fighting.

77
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:15,280
And a lot of wrestlers back in the
day used to do the same thing. Um,

78
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,460
my weight cut though was nowhere near as
extreme as some of the MMA fighters do.

79
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,570
Some MMA fighters. I mean, they're
getting on death's door and, um,

80
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:27,123
I just,

81
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,080
I just think it's one of
the most disturbing and, uh,

82
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,710
most unfortunate aspects of MMA. Uh,

83
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,570
Kevin Lee said before his last fight
with Tony Ferguson that, you know,

84
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:41,410
he felt like he was,

85
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,250
he was dying when he was cutting weight
and he made the weight Habib number go

86
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,130
mid off, who's the, if not the best,

87
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:51,820
one of the very best
lightweights in the world. Um,

88
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:56,230
undefeated had his body
shut down last time.

89
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,600
He tried to make the and couldn't
make the Tony Ferguson fight.

90
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,510
They pulled them out and took
him to the hospital. I mean I'm,

91
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,020
I'm beating a dead horse here cause
it's something that everybody knows.

92
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:11,000
Everybody's aware that it's a
terrible, terrible aspect of our sport.

93
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:15,020
And in my mind it's contrary to what
martial arts are supposed to be about.

94
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,370
So in that sense,

95
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,940
I encourage Calvin to stay at 185 pounds
because obviously the guy's knocked

96
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:26,780
out. Vito Belfort at one 85 it
just knocked out a former champion,

97
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,210
Michael Bisping at 185 pounds.

98
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,210
I mean he could knock out anybody at one
85 but a guy like Chris Weidman who is

99
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:39,410
very smart about cutting
weight, he cuts a lot of weight,

100
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:40,640
but he does it the right way.

101
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:43,490
Rehydrates the right way and
he's just a fucking beast.

102
00:06:43,491 --> 00:06:44,690
He's just so much bigger.

103
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:48,470
And when he got Kelvin to the ground and
submitted him with a head and arm choke

104
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,280
boy, it just really seems like that's
the wrong way class for Calvin.

105
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,800
And then you see Calvin next fight,

106
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,920
fight Bisbing and just fucking
lights him up in the first round.

107
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,760
Now would he have been able to
do that if he fought the Bisping?

108
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,860
That was training for
George Saint Pierre. I mean,

109
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:10,910
if Bisping did not have the George st
Pierre fight and just went right into the

110
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,330
Calvin gasoline fight with
the same result of happen,

111
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,530
it could very well have the way
Calvin hits, he's fast as fuck.

112
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,300
His hands are beautiful. He throws
really crisp straight punches.

113
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,750
And in this sport there's not a
whole lot of guys who have crisper,

114
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:33,140
sharper hands at 185 pounds than Calvin.

115
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:38,470
I mean he just has beautiful head movement
and boxing and when he moves in for

116
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:42,410
the kill with those hands, Whoa. I
mean you saw the Vito Belfort fight.

117
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,570
I mean he just fucked be tore up.

118
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:49,571
But those straight punches and he throws
them efficiently and they have snap to

119
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:53,660
them. And just, and on top of that,
he's a very good wrestler. I mean,

120
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,170
a lot of people forget how good his
wrestling skills are on top of all that.

121
00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:00,050
He's just a real threat at 185 pounds.

122
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Fascinating thing because it's
just such a wide open division.

123
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,600
He just called out, um, Robert Whittaker,

124
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,320
who's the interim champion
of course, and uh,

125
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:16,700
call that Whitaker and wants
Whitaker to, uh, to fight him next.

126
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,680
But of course Robert Whittaker is,
uh, waiting for the big pay day.

127
00:08:21,681 --> 00:08:26,480
I would too if I was him to fight
George Saint Pierre. So it's a,

128
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,060
it's a wide open division now
that st Pierre choked out.

129
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:32,570
Michael Bisbing and then
gelt Calvin just lights up.

130
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:37,571
Bisping and of course you've got to
think that Weidman is still in the mix.

131
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,850
I mean, even though Waiban lost to
Yoel Romero and then lost to gig,

132
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,580
Arden was saucy. He's
still in the mix. Uh,

133
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:49,580
he was winning that Yoel
Romero fight in my opinion,

134
00:08:49,581 --> 00:08:51,890
until he got caught with
that wicked flying knee.

135
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,350
But that's the danger
of fighting Gol Meryl,

136
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,600
you all Ramiro could do that
to anybody in the world.

137
00:08:57,601 --> 00:09:02,280
He's just such a fucking
freak athlete. Uh, so really,

138
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,030
really wide open division to
get back to that fight. Uh,

139
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,940
I agree entirely with a,

140
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:11,910
to get back to the Bisbing
and Calvin gasoline fight.

141
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,420
I agree 100% with what
Brendan Schaub said,

142
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,350
that you really have to protect
a fighter from themselves.

143
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,120
You really can't be letting a guy fight
three weeks after an absolutely brutal

144
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:28,950
fight like that. It just does not make
sense. It just does not make sense. Um,

145
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,060
I don't think it's smart.

146
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:34,770
I mean I understand that
UFC needed someone to fill
in and short notice because

147
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:39,690
Anderson Silva tested positive
for performance enhancing
drugs and they did not

148
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:43,170
want to lose the, uh, Shanghai main event.

149
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:48,710
So it turns into an even bigger fight
when you've got the former middleweight

150
00:09:48,751 --> 00:09:52,740
champion right off of his loss three
weeks later fighting again. But

151
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,300
it's just not smart. I know
Bisbing wanted to do it.

152
00:09:57,301 --> 00:09:59,540
I know Bisping would probably do
it again if you asked him to do it.

153
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,550
If you ask Bisping to fight in a couple
of weeks and probably probably do it

154
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,740
again. And, and um,

155
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:10,470
someone was talking about him fighting
in England, I believe in March, which

156
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,710
boy, I mean that's less crazy,
but still crazy, right? Cause uh,

157
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:21,330
we're basically in into December. So
you've got December, January, February,

158
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:24,270
three months off really, and then March.

159
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:29,010
But of course during that time he's going
to be sparring and you know, you know,

160
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,220
Bisbing he's a fucking animal.
He's not going to train easy.

161
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:35,160
He's not going to take
much time off. And, uh,

162
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:39,810
there's a lot of debate as to how much
time a fighter should be forced to take

163
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:44,460
off after they get knocked out.
And here's the thing about that.

164
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,190
You're, you're seeing guys
when they're fighting, fighting

165
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,830
and you're seeing them getting knocked
out and you're seeing them fighting,

166
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,280
you know, X amount of months
later. So you saw Bisping,

167
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:56,990
he didn't get knocked out
by George Saint Pierre,

168
00:10:56,991 --> 00:11:00,080
but he certainly got rocked with
that left hook. And then, uh,

169
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,970
he got choked out when he
was on the ground out. Now,

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,240
for people who don't know a lot about MMA,

171
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,550
getting choked out is not nearly as
bad as getting knocked out. It's,

172
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:11,720
there's almost nothing to it.

173
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,370
The way to look at it is if you look at
a garden hose and you know how you can

174
00:11:16,371 --> 00:11:20,720
bend the garden hose, crimp it down,
and it stops the water from coming out,

175
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:25,610
that's exactly what happens to your
fucking brain when you get choked out.

176
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,550
When you get choked out, it's basically
cutting off the blood. Your brain,

177
00:11:28,551 --> 00:11:32,450
you wake up and you're fine.
You don't have memory issues,

178
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,550
you don't have balance
issues for the most part,

179
00:11:34,551 --> 00:11:37,370
especially if you've only been
out for a couple of seconds. Um,

180
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,420
it happens all of the
time in training. Uh,

181
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:44,540
I've seen many, many guys
get choked unconscious.

182
00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:47,660
I've choked people unconscious.
They come back and they're fine.

183
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:53,030
It's not that big of a deal, but you've
got to realize before he got choked,

184
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,280
he got hit with a big fucking left-hand
and hurt. And it was a great fight.

185
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,450
Before that, uh, both guys were,

186
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,790
were giving and tanking fighters
need time off after fights.

187
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,590
So you're seeing that, right?

188
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,670
You're seeing the actual competition
between George Saint Pierre,

189
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:10,504
Michael Bisping. Well,

190
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,600
where are you not seeing is how many
times he got hit during training?

191
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,170
Did he get rock Devore did he
get clipped and dropped? Uh,

192
00:12:17,171 --> 00:12:20,860
did he get dropped in hurt and take a
couple of days off and then get back to

193
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:24,100
training again? Only he
knows only his camp knows.

194
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:27,700
And most of the times they're not talking.
But you hear about it all the time.

195
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,490
And matter of fact, I was
talking to Forrest Griffin wants,

196
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,920
and Forrest was telling me that
before he fought Anderson Silva,

197
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:41,140
he was knocked unconscious twice
in training. That's fucking crazy.

198
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,480
I mean, here he is

199
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:49,600
about to fight the greatest pound
for pound fighter of all time.

200
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,730
Next to, I mean there's, there's, there's
three guys in that debate, right? My,

201
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,480
my number one guy right now is
mighty mouse. I think just, he,

202
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,370
he represents the highest skill level.

203
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,780
But does he represent the
highest competition level
in terms of like the guys

204
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:07,120
he's faced? I don't think so.

205
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:10,270
I think number one competition
level is Jon Jones.

206
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,710
Jon Jones has choked out
Liotta Machida rampage Jackson.

207
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:19,510
He's beat Rashad Evans. He
beat Alexander Gustafson,

208
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,420
he beat Glover to Shera.
He beat Vitor Belfort.

209
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:26,740
He beat Daniel Cormier twice. I mean fuck,

210
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:30,610
he's beaten everybody. I think
you look at competition wise,

211
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,020
John Jones is a very strong argument
for the greatest of all time,

212
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,800
but Anderson Silva's fucking
right there. Two men,

213
00:13:38,801 --> 00:13:40,450
Anderson Silva in his prime.

214
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,840
I think when you look at the way he
knocked out Vito Belfort with that front

215
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:47,800
kick to the face, when you
look at the way he fought,

216
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:51,280
Forrest Griffin in that fight
we were just talking about,

217
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:56,080
andK owed him like a magician the way he
fought Stephan Bonner and literally put

218
00:13:56,081 --> 00:13:59,980
his back up against the cage. And again,
Stephan Bonner and Forrest Griffin,

219
00:13:59,981 --> 00:14:02,710
they're just, no disrespect.

220
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,040
They're not at the same level as the
Liotta Machida or glow over to Shera or

221
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:14,230
some of the guys that Jon
Jones has phased. But it's
the way Anderson beat them.

222
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,430
I mean, Anderson was just in his
prime. He was off fucking master,

223
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:21,490
like a real master. Uh,

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,950
so Forrest Griffin fighting Anderson
Silva after being Kao twice in training

225
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,200
camp is just insane.

226
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:34,030
But these are the things that fighters
do when they have to do them. You know,

227
00:14:34,031 --> 00:14:37,390
you're talking about a giant pay day,
you're talking about a big fight.

228
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,370
You give the guy a chance
like, do you want to fight?

229
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,710
Do you think you could fight?
Yeah, I, yeah, I could do it.

230
00:14:41,711 --> 00:14:44,890
I could do it and they'd go out there
and they're compromise and they get

231
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:48,880
clipped and you see it immediately.
Sometimes. Sometimes you see guys,

232
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,350
they get clipped and you don't know why.

233
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,380
I mean they get hit with something and
look at any deal anytime when a person is

234
00:14:57,051 --> 00:15:00,590
throwing a punch or kick at you and
it connects, it can put you out,

235
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:04,340
but there's no doubt at
all, no doubt about it,

236
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,760
that the resiliency of a fighter
after they'd been code is compromised.

237
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,500
There's just no doubt about it.

238
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,940
When you see a guy who has been code
and then you see them get hit weeks,

239
00:15:16,941 --> 00:15:19,850
months later, they cannot
take a shot at the same way.

240
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,830
Their brain is still recovering.

241
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,260
Their body is still recovering
from the concussion.

242
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,710
And you have to figure out a way to
balance being a risk taker and seizing an

243
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,041
opportunity,

244
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:39,041
which is a huge opportunity versus
concentrating on having a long and healthy

245
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:43,970
career. Now that said,
for Michael Bisping,

246
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,990
he's kind of at the end
of his career. I mean,

247
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:50,480
he said essentially that he wants
a fight one more time in England,

248
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,410
which would be beautiful for him.
And I hope they give him a, you know,

249
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,380
a good match up. So it'll be
a good fight for the fans.

250
00:15:57,620 --> 00:16:00,530
And I hope they give Michael
some time off. You know,

251
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:05,360
give the man some time to really relax
and then go through a real nice three,

252
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,560
four month training camp,

253
00:16:06,561 --> 00:16:10,070
getting excellent shape and give his
best effort for one more. Go at it.

254
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,120
I would like to see that,

255
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:16,630
but it might be the hardest shit in the
world to talk a fighter into retiring.
