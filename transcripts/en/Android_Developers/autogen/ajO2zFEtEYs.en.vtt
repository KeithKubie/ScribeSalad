born from the Android design
 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.190
born from the Android design
on the on the show and he walked us

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200
on the on the show and he walked us
 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.570
on the on the show and he walked us
through some of the just the general

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580
through some of the just the general
 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.860
through some of the just the general
structure that the Android design team

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
structure that the Android design team
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.930
structure that the Android design team
here at Google uses in their design

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940
here at Google uses in their design
 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.120
here at Google uses in their design
process and this can definitely be

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
process and this can definitely be
 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.850

design of the Google i/o app which is
 

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:54.360

actually a really great open source

00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:54.370
actually a really great open source
 

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:57.670
actually a really great open source
project that we update every year

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680
project that we update every year
 

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.809

in a head of Google i/o and it we like

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:01.819
in a head of Google i/o and it we like
 

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:04.359
in a head of Google i/o and it we like
throwing in latest developments and new

00:09:04.359 --> 00:09:04.369

features in the platform and it's
 

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:08.290
features in the platform and it's
definitely a great reference app to go

00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:08.300
definitely a great reference app to go
 

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:12.489
definitely a great reference app to go

have on Google Play Movies music books
 

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:52.509
have on Google Play Movies music books
etc so all those apps were redesigned

00:10:52.509 --> 00:10:52.519
etc so all those apps were redesigned
 

00:10:52.519 --> 00:10:57.579

overarching principles that they were
 

00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:04.109
overarching principles that they were
going for being to be responsive to have

00:11:04.109 --> 00:11:04.119
going for being to be responsive to have
 

00:11:04.119 --> 00:11:06.910
going for being to be responsive to have
modular elements and also to be familiar

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920
modular elements and also to be familiar
 

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.100
modular elements and also to be familiar
and emotionally evocative throughout so

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:12.110
and emotionally evocative throughout so
 

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.960
and emotionally evocative throughout so

I'm only showing the after and kind of a

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.050
I'm only showing the after and kind of a
 

00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:19.810
I'm only showing the after and kind of a
nice look and feel that you guys were

00:11:19.810 --> 00:11:19.820
nice look and feel that you guys were
 

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:22.390
nice look and feel that you guys were
used to now but if you go back and look

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:22.400
used to now but if you go back and look
 

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.560
used to now but if you go back and look
before they showed kind of the design

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:25.570
before they showed kind of the design
 

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:28.330
before they showed kind of the design
fragmentation between the web product

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:28.340

between the tablet and phone products

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320
between the tablet and phone products
 

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:35.350
between the tablet and phone products
and so it was definitely a great move to

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360
and so it was definitely a great move to
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.450
and so it was definitely a great move to
to bring everything together to brand

00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:37.460
to bring everything together to brand
 

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.870
to bring everything together to brand
everything in a way that it sets an

we'll talk about that more when when we

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:48.470
we'll talk about that more when when we
 

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.230
we'll talk about that more when when we
discuss the the branding and consistency

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240
discuss the the branding and consistency
 

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.000
discuss the the branding and consistency
but it's just a great example of

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:54.010
but it's just a great example of
 

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.120
but it's just a great example of
responsive apps where the the UI adapts

00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:58.130
responsive apps where the the UI adapts
 

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:02.590
responsive apps where the the UI adapts
to the screen sides and the UI is is

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600
to the screen sides and the UI is is
 

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:05.140
to the screen sides and the UI is is
very fluid and dynamic based on the

patterns it'll just make a huge

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:44.300
patterns it'll just make a huge
 

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.950
patterns it'll just make a huge
difference overall yeah should we move

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:47.960
difference overall yeah should we move
 

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:50.920

kind of use those expected metaphors and

00:20:25.349 --> 00:20:25.359
kind of use those expected metaphors and
 

00:20:25.359 --> 00:20:28.450
kind of use those expected metaphors and
visual indicators throughout so that

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:28.460
visual indicators throughout so that
 

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.580
visual indicators throughout so that
users know exactly how a component even

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:30.590
users know exactly how a component even
 

00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:33.940
users know exactly how a component even
if it isn't exactly as it looks they'll

00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:33.950
if it isn't exactly as it looks they'll
 

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.919
if it isn't exactly as it looks they'll
know how it can be used because you're

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:35.929
know how it can be used because you're
 

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:38.859
know how it can be used because you're
kind of starting at the right place yeah

you know if it's if you're gonna make
 

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.930
you know if it's if you're gonna make
something you should make you should

something you should make you should
 

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:45.879
something you should make you should
make your UI elements interesting you

00:20:45.879 --> 00:20:45.889

still very very familiar because you
 

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:56.440
still very very familiar because you
really want to lean on what users

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:56.450

already know and what users already know
 

00:20:58.639 --> 00:21:00.549
already know and what users already know
are the things that are in apps like

00:21:00.549 --> 00:21:00.559
are the things that are in apps like
 

00:21:00.559 --> 00:21:04.090
are the things that are in apps like
Gmail and and Google keep and in chrome

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:04.100

things like the overflow things like you
 

00:21:06.799 --> 00:21:08.830
things like the overflow things like you
know tabs and the navigations are those

things exist you know in terms of
 

00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:12.070
things exist you know in terms of
interaction design for visual design you

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080
interaction design for visual design you
 

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.479
interaction design for visual design you
really want to take that and kind of

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:13.489
really want to take that and kind of
 

00:21:13.489 --> 00:21:16.119
really want to take that and kind of
extend holo not replace it not you know

00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:16.129
extend holo not replace it not you know
 

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:18.849
extend holo not replace it not you know
use it wholesale but really extend it

00:21:18.849 --> 00:21:18.859
use it wholesale but really extend it
 

00:21:18.859 --> 00:21:20.710
use it wholesale but really extend it
and really kind of pump it with your own

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720
and really kind of pump it with your own
 

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.739
and really kind of pump it with your own
sense with your own branding I guess

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:22.749
sense with your own branding I guess
 

00:21:22.749 --> 00:21:25.180
sense with your own branding I guess
yeah definitely and then the design

00:21:25.180 --> 00:21:25.190
yeah definitely and then the design
 

00:21:25.190 --> 00:21:27.039
yeah definitely and then the design
principle from the Android design guide

00:21:27.039 --> 00:21:27.049

that really is Express here is users

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:30.289
that really is Express here is users
 

00:21:30.289 --> 00:21:31.779
that really is Express here is users
should have tricks that they can use

00:21:31.779 --> 00:21:31.789
should have tricks that they can use
 

00:21:31.789 --> 00:21:34.810
should have tricks that they can use
everywhere and so that's what we've been

00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:34.820
everywhere and so that's what we've been
 

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:36.220
everywhere and so that's what we've been
talking about you know these little

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:36.230
talking about you know these little
 

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:38.409
talking about you know these little
visual indicators that users expect to

00:21:38.409 --> 00:21:38.419
visual indicators that users expect to
 

00:21:38.419 --> 00:21:40.239
visual indicators that users expect to
behave a certain way you know don't go

00:21:40.239 --> 00:21:40.249
behave a certain way you know don't go
 

00:21:40.249 --> 00:21:41.979
behave a certain way you know don't go
replacing that just because you think it

00:21:41.979 --> 00:21:41.989
replacing that just because you think it
 

00:21:41.989 --> 00:21:46.210
replacing that just because you think it
looks cool okay so let's let's move on

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:46.220
looks cool okay so let's let's move on
 

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:50.349
looks cool okay so let's let's move on
to common UX issues yeah so this was

00:21:50.349 --> 00:21:50.359
to common UX issues yeah so this was
 

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:53.739
to common UX issues yeah so this was
definitely the one of our more ranty

00:21:53.739 --> 00:21:53.749
definitely the one of our more ranty
 

00:21:53.749 --> 00:21:59.259
definitely the one of our more ranty
episodes where one longer there was

00:21:59.259 --> 00:21:59.269
episodes where one longer there was
 

00:21:59.269 --> 00:22:01.419
episodes where one longer there was
there was a top 10 list we counted it

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:01.429
there was a top 10 list we counted it
 

00:22:01.429 --> 00:22:07.479
there was a top 10 list we counted it
back of really common UX issues or

00:22:07.479 --> 00:22:07.489
back of really common UX issues or
 

00:22:07.489 --> 00:22:09.970
back of really common UX issues or
problems that that we on the developer

a rant and spelling them out will

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:34.940
a rant and spelling them out will
 

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.610
a rant and spelling them out will
hopefully prevent them from spreading to

00:22:38.610 --> 00:22:38.620
hopefully prevent them from spreading to
 

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:42.370
hopefully prevent them from spreading to
to more apps out there in the wild so I

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:42.380
to more apps out there in the wild so I
 

00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:44.500
to more apps out there in the wild so I
pulled out just a couple of these for

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.510
pulled out just a couple of these for
 

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:47.500
pulled out just a couple of these for
for the full list and the full detailed

over the network is to do it before you

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:15.470
over the network is to do it before you
 

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.890
over the network is to do it before you
show it to the user so wherever possible

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:17.900
show it to the user so wherever possible
 

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.870
show it to the user so wherever possible
obviously that's not possible in every

00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.880
obviously that's not possible in every
 

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.210
obviously that's not possible in every
case especially for you know real-time

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:22.220

presenting a loading indicator it's best
 

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:32.620
presenting a loading indicator it's best

or you know somewhere prominent on the
 

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.890
or you know somewhere prominent on the
action bar for example to indicate that

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:38.900
action bar for example to indicate that
 

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.020
action bar for example to indicate that
that something is loading in from the

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:41.030
that something is loading in from the
 

00:23:41.030 --> 00:23:43.330
that something is loading in from the

pop-up dialog blocks off attraction the
 

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.900
pop-up dialog blocks off attraction the
worst thing about this is when when you

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:49.910
worst thing about this is when when you
 

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.610
worst thing about this is when when you
override the back button so that you

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:51.620
override the back button so that you
 

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:53.560
override the back button so that you
can't cancel the dialog until the

00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:53.570
can't cancel the dialog until the
 

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.560
can't cancel the dialog until the
loading process actually completes so

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:56.570
loading process actually completes so
 

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:59.830
loading process actually completes so
that's a big no-no and you definitely

00:23:59.830 --> 00:23:59.840
that's a big no-no and you definitely
 

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.680
that's a big no-no and you definitely
should go through your apps and it's

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:02.690
should go through your apps and it's
 

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.450
should go through your apps and it's
kind of streamline your use of loading

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:04.460
kind of streamline your use of loading
 

00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:07.060

splitting foul on them yep let's let's

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:14.360
splitting foul on them yep let's let's
 

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.370

go on in the interest of time so I'm

00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:18.380
go on in the interest of time so I'm
 

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.500
go on in the interest of time so I'm
gonna flip through a bunch of best

gonna flip through a bunch of best
 

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.510
gonna flip through a bunch of best
practices and actually so those episodes

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520
practices and actually so those episodes
 

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.070
practices and actually so those episodes
you know a very inspirational we had a

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080
you know a very inspirational we had a
 

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.010
you know a very inspirational we had a
bunch of rants you know a lot of that is

00:24:27.010 --> 00:24:27.020
bunch of rants you know a lot of that is
 

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.500
bunch of rants you know a lot of that is
kind of on the lesson the education side

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:29.510
kind of on the lesson the education side
 

00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:31.810
kind of on the lesson the education side
I guess lesson the learning about

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:31.820
I guess lesson the learning about
 

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.850
I guess lesson the learning about

the episodes that we where we actually
 

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:45.940
the episodes that we where we actually
shared some best practices some of our

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:45.950
shared some best practices some of our
 

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:48.370

you implement action bars or how you

00:24:49.810 --> 00:24:49.820
you implement action bars or how you
 

00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:51.160
you implement action bars or how you
implement navigation drawers and things

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:51.170

like that so the first one I want to

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:53.330
like that so the first one I want to
 

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.960
like that so the first one I want to
talk about is units of measure in this

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:55.970
talk about is units of measure in this
 

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.170

we talked specifically about density

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:02.630
we talked specifically about density
 

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:05.680
we talked specifically about density
independent pixels how you calculate

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:05.690

dips screen density grids basically
 

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.900
dips screen density grids basically
everything related to a lot of the

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:10.910
everything related to a lot of the
 

00:25:10.910 --> 00:25:12.970
everything related to a lot of the

we talk about units of measure we also

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:23.030
we talk about units of measure we also
 

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.680
we talk about units of measure we also
talked about looking at devices in terms

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:26.690
talked about looking at devices in terms
 

00:25:26.690 --> 00:25:28.990
talked about looking at devices in terms
of their density independent pixel

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000
of their density independent pixel
 

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.910
of their density independent pixel
resolution rather than pixel rather than

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:30.920
resolution rather than pixel rather than
 

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.010
resolution rather than pixel rather than
their pixel resolution so for example

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:33.020
their pixel resolution so for example
 

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:36.490
their pixel resolution so for example

so it's just a great example of that and

00:26:54.730 --> 00:26:54.740
so it's just a great example of that and
 

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:56.410
so it's just a great example of that and
then we also briefly talked about

00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:56.420
then we also briefly talked about
 

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.080
then we also briefly talked about
over-the-air install with the Google+

00:26:59.080 --> 00:26:59.090
over-the-air install with the Google+
 

00:26:59.090 --> 00:27:02.350
over-the-air install with the Google+
integration stuff so so it's one of my

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360
integration stuff so so it's one of my
 

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.260
integration stuff so so it's one of my
my bare kind of subjects I kind of like

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:05.270
my bare kind of subjects I kind of like
 

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:06.850
my bare kind of subjects I kind of like
to think that there's a you know a

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:06.860
to think that there's a you know a
 

00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:08.800
to think that there's a you know a
funnel of people trying to use your app

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:08.810
funnel of people trying to use your app
 

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:10.810
funnel of people trying to use your app
and every time we do one of these kind

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:10.820
and every time we do one of these kind
 

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:11.740
and every time we do one of these kind
of anti-patterns

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:11.750
of anti-patterns
 

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:13.390
of anti-patterns
the funnel gets smaller and you'd lose a

00:27:13.390 --> 00:27:13.400
the funnel gets smaller and you'd lose a
 

00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.390
the funnel gets smaller and you'd lose a
few users so it's really kind of like

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:15.400
few users so it's really kind of like
 

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.380
few users so it's really kind of like
you know interesting exercise to

00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:17.390
you know interesting exercise to
 

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:19.210
you know interesting exercise to
critically look at your your startup

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:19.220
critically look at your your startup
 

00:27:19.220 --> 00:27:20.740
critically look at your your startup
flow and see where you are potentially

00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:20.750
flow and see where you are potentially
 

00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:24.520
flow and see where you are potentially
gonna need some people no pressure the

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:24.530
gonna need some people no pressure the
 

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:26.680
gonna need some people no pressure the
next best practice thing we talked about

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:26.690
next best practice thing we talked about
 

00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:28.510
next best practice thing we talked about
again in the area of visual design was

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.520
again in the area of visual design was
 

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.030
again in the area of visual design was

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:50.580
smorgasbord almost of different ways in
 

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:52.580
smorgasbord almost of different ways in
which apps are doing things great in

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:52.590
which apps are doing things great in
 

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:57.500
which apps are doing things great in

next best practice episode type thing
 

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:03.230
next best practice episode type thing
that we had was one on images that we

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:03.240
that we had was one on images that we
 

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.550
that we had was one on images that we
did back in October and here we talked

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:07.560
did back in October and here we talked
 

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.430
did back in October and here we talked
about the different ways in which in

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440
about the different ways in which in
 

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.810
about the different ways in which in
which you can actually do interesting

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:11.820
which you can actually do interesting
 

00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.210
which you can actually do interesting
things with images so we talked about

00:32:14.210 --> 00:32:14.220
things with images so we talked about
 

00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:16.220
things with images so we talked about
some best practices like how to show

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:16.230
some best practices like how to show
 

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.010
some best practices like how to show
text overlays when showing banner images

00:32:19.010 --> 00:32:19.020
text overlays when showing banner images
 

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.560
text overlays when showing banner images
or or thumbnails we talked about

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:21.570
or or thumbnails we talked about
 

00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.930
or or thumbnails we talked about
placeholders in this example we talked

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:23.940
placeholders in this example we talked
 

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:25.490
placeholders in this example we talked
about how Pinterest does a great job of

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500
about how Pinterest does a great job of
 

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.880
about how Pinterest does a great job of
actually actually keying the placeholder

00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:28.890
actually actually keying the placeholder
 

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:31.670
actually actually keying the placeholder
a color based on the image so they

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:31.680
a color based on the image so they
 

00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:33.260
a color based on the image so they
actually it seems like they store

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:33.270
actually it seems like they store
 

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:35.720
actually it seems like they store
another bit almost in the database of

00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:35.730
another bit almost in the database of
 

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.740
another bit almost in the database of
the key color in the image and they show

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:39.750
the key color in the image and they show
 

00:32:39.750 --> 00:32:41.750
the key color in the image and they show
that color before the image itself loads

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760
that color before the image itself loads
 

00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.880
that color before the image itself loads
so it gives you a little touch of

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:43.890
so it gives you a little touch of
 

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.220
so it gives you a little touch of
context as to what's going to show up in

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:46.230
context as to what's going to show up in
 

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:49.100
context as to what's going to show up in
that space we also talked about the

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:49.110
that space we also talked about the
 

00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:51.140
that space we also talked about the
center cropping technique which is a

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:51.150
center cropping technique which is a
 

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:54.380
center cropping technique which is a
great way to basically you know allow

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:54.390
great way to basically you know allow
 

00:32:54.390 --> 00:32:56.600
great way to basically you know allow
your uisce to scale to different aspect

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:56.610
your uisce to scale to different aspect
 

00:32:56.610 --> 00:32:59.360
your uisce to scale to different aspect
ratios and in the center cropping

00:32:59.360 --> 00:32:59.370
ratios and in the center cropping
 

00:32:59.370 --> 00:33:01.670
ratios and in the center cropping
technique you basically it's actually

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:01.680
technique you basically it's actually
 

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.830
technique you basically it's actually
very simple to use you should actually

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840
very simple to use you should actually
 

00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.480
very simple to use you should actually
just set the scale type to sent their

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:05.490
just set the scale type to sent their
 

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:07.970
just set the scale type to sent their
crop on an image view but in this

00:33:07.970 --> 00:33:07.980
crop on an image view but in this
 

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:10.430
crop on an image view but in this
technique you basically chop off either

00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440
technique you basically chop off either
 

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.870
technique you basically chop off either
to the left and right or the top and

00:33:11.870 --> 00:33:11.880
to the left and right or the top and
 

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.260
to the left and right or the top and
bottom of an image if if the aspect

00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:15.270
bottom of an image if if the aspect
 

00:33:15.270 --> 00:33:17.480
bottom of an image if if the aspect
ratio of the image and its target

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:17.490
ratio of the image and its target
 

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:21.140
ratio of the image and its target
destination don't match and we also

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.150
destination don't match and we also
 

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.330
destination don't match and we also
talked about focus things like using

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:23.340
talked about focus things like using
 

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.480
talked about focus things like using
blurring and din

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:24.490
blurring and din
 

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:27.180
blurring and din
techniques to help the user really focus

00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:27.190
techniques to help the user really focus
 

00:33:27.190 --> 00:33:29.250
techniques to help the user really focus
on the most important things whether it

00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:29.260
on the most important things whether it
 

00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.460
on the most important things whether it
be the text in front or you know gray

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:32.470
be the text in front or you know gray
 

00:33:32.470 --> 00:33:34.200
be the text in front or you know gray
scaling and image if it's not important

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:34.210
scaling and image if it's not important
 

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:36.299
scaling and image if it's not important
things like that so overall we just

00:33:36.299 --> 00:33:36.309
things like that so overall we just
 

00:33:36.309 --> 00:33:37.590
things like that so overall we just
touched on a bunch of different best

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:37.600
touched on a bunch of different best
 

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.990
touched on a bunch of different best
practices and a couple of ideas on how

00:33:39.990 --> 00:33:40.000
practices and a couple of ideas on how
 

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.760
practices and a couple of ideas on how
to present images so moving on we we did

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:44.770
to present images so moving on we we did
 

00:33:44.770 --> 00:33:46.799
to present images so moving on we we did
another episode on best practices for

00:33:46.799 --> 00:33:46.809
another episode on best practices for
 

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:49.950
another episode on best practices for
presenting maps in your app so we talked

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960
presenting maps in your app so we talked
 

00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.530
presenting maps in your app so we talked
about things like you know the different

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:52.540
about things like you know the different
 

00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.299
about things like you know the different
ways in which users can interact or

00:33:54.299 --> 00:33:54.309
ways in which users can interact or
 

00:33:54.309 --> 00:33:56.010
ways in which users can interact or
should be able to interact with a map

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:56.020
should be able to interact with a map
 

00:33:56.020 --> 00:33:57.630
should be able to interact with a map
the different ways in which you can

00:33:57.630 --> 00:33:57.640
the different ways in which you can
 

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.510
the different ways in which you can
present and allow interaction with

00:33:59.510 --> 00:33:59.520
present and allow interaction with
 

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.220
present and allow interaction with
markers and info windows and we spent

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:02.230
markers and info windows and we spent
 

00:34:02.230 --> 00:34:04.020
markers and info windows and we spent
some time talking about the marker the

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:04.030
some time talking about the marker the
 

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.810
some time talking about the marker the
visual design of markers basically how

00:34:06.810 --> 00:34:06.820
visual design of markers basically how
 

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:08.310
visual design of markers basically how
you can introduce branding it's

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:08.320
you can introduce branding it's
 

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.680
you can introduce branding it's
something that is you know from a shape

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:10.690
something that is you know from a shape
 

00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.540
something that is you know from a shape
standpoint the shape of a marker is

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:12.550
standpoint the shape of a marker is
 

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:15.419
standpoint the shape of a marker is
generally pretty standard but how you

00:34:15.419 --> 00:34:15.429
generally pretty standard but how you
 

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:16.500
generally pretty standard but how you
can actually introduce some of your

00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:16.510
can actually introduce some of your
 

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:18.750
can actually introduce some of your
branding into that as well as how to

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:18.760
branding into that as well as how to
 

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:20.520
branding into that as well as how to
deal with density if you have tons and

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:20.530
deal with density if you have tons and
 

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:22.379
deal with density if you have tons and
tons of markers how can you actually

00:34:22.379 --> 00:34:22.389
tons of markers how can you actually
 

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:25.139
tons of markers how can you actually
still allow the user to see the map

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:25.149
still allow the user to see the map
 

00:34:25.149 --> 00:34:27.300
still allow the user to see the map
underneath all the markers so we talked

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.310
underneath all the markers so we talked
 

00:34:27.310 --> 00:34:29.790
underneath all the markers so we talked
about that for quite a bit we talked

00:34:29.790 --> 00:34:29.800
about that for quite a bit we talked
 

00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:31.230
about that for quite a bit we talked
about fullscreen and I'll get to that in

00:34:31.230 --> 00:34:31.240
about fullscreen and I'll get to that in
 

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.419
about fullscreen and I'll get to that in
a second we talked about an embedded map

00:34:33.419 --> 00:34:33.429
a second we talked about an embedded map
 

00:34:33.429 --> 00:34:35.369
a second we talked about an embedded map
mode which Foursquare does really well

00:34:35.369 --> 00:34:35.379
mode which Foursquare does really well
 

00:34:35.379 --> 00:34:37.230
mode which Foursquare does really well
with but we talked about about

00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240
with but we talked about about
 

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:40.080
with but we talked about about
fullscreen and actually in Android 4.4

00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.090
fullscreen and actually in Android 4.4
 

00:34:40.090 --> 00:34:43.280
fullscreen and actually in Android 4.4
we also talked about translucent

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:43.290
we also talked about translucent
 

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.590
we also talked about translucent
navigation and status bars and these

00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:46.600
navigation and status bars and these
 

00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.570
navigation and status bars and these
actually go hand in hand another thing

00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:48.580
actually go hand in hand another thing
 

00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:50.129
actually go hand in hand another thing
that we talked about in the Android 4.4

00:34:50.129 --> 00:34:50.139
that we talked about in the Android 4.4
 

00:34:50.139 --> 00:34:53.970
that we talked about in the Android 4.4
episode was map padding so actually in

00:34:53.970 --> 00:34:53.980
episode was map padding so actually in
 

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.129
episode was map padding so actually in
recent versions of the map library you

00:34:56.129 --> 00:34:56.139
recent versions of the map library you
 

00:34:56.139 --> 00:34:59.700
recent versions of the map library you
can offset these controls like the zoom

00:34:59.700 --> 00:34:59.710
can offset these controls like the zoom
 

00:34:59.710 --> 00:35:02.099
can offset these controls like the zoom
control as well as the compass and my

00:35:02.099 --> 00:35:02.109
control as well as the compass and my
 

00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:03.870
control as well as the compass and my
location control you can actually offset

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880
location control you can actually offset
 

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.500
location control you can actually offset
those and and still show the map above

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:07.510
those and and still show the map above
 

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:10.070
those and and still show the map above
and below those controls so really helps

00:35:10.070 --> 00:35:10.080
and below those controls so really helps
 

00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:12.450
and below those controls so really helps
when presenting a map and this kind of

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:12.460
when presenting a map and this kind of
 

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.609
when presenting a map and this kind of
more full screen or more immersive mode

00:35:16.609 --> 00:35:16.619
more full screen or more immersive mode
 

00:35:16.619 --> 00:35:18.930
more full screen or more immersive mode
before we move on I've been I've been

00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:18.940
before we move on I've been I've been
 

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:20.700
before we move on I've been I've been
talking a lot you guys have any comments

00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:20.710
talking a lot you guys have any comments
 

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:24.690
talking a lot you guys have any comments
on on maps or anything about yeah now

00:35:24.690 --> 00:35:24.700
on on maps or anything about yeah now
 

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.870
on on maps or anything about yeah now
all right let's plow ahead we did

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:27.880
all right let's plow ahead we did
 

00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.310
all right let's plow ahead we did
another episode on home screen widgets

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:29.320
another episode on home screen widgets
 

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.099
another episode on home screen widgets
this was back in March and in this

00:35:32.099 --> 00:35:32.109
this was back in March and in this
 

00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:34.260
this was back in March and in this
episode we talked about the different

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:34.270
episode we talked about the different
 

00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.910
episode we talked about the different
types of home screen widgets things like

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920
types of home screen widgets things like
 

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:36.770
types of home screen widgets things like
you know in

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780
you know in
 

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.690
you know in
only widgets like your current weather

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:38.700
only widgets like your current weather
 

00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.760
only widgets like your current weather
or control widgets like the power

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:40.770
or control widgets like the power
 

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:43.160
or control widgets like the power
control hybrid widgets and collection

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:43.170
control hybrid widgets and collection
 

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:44.630
control hybrid widgets and collection
widgets we talked about the different

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640
widgets we talked about the different
 

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:47.090
widgets we talked about the different
kind of patterns for content to show

00:35:47.090 --> 00:35:47.100
kind of patterns for content to show
 

00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:50.180
kind of patterns for content to show
inside of a widget we also not pictured

00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:50.190
inside of a widget we also not pictured
 

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.400
inside of a widget we also not pictured
in in these thumbnails here we talked

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:52.410
in in these thumbnails here we talked
 

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:53.570
in in these thumbnails here we talked
about some of the constraints like

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:53.580
about some of the constraints like
 

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.490
about some of the constraints like
things you just can't do with widgets

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500
things you just can't do with widgets
 

00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:57.200
things you just can't do with widgets
like you can't play videos and widgets

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:57.210
like you can't play videos and widgets
 

00:35:57.210 --> 00:35:59.720
like you can't play videos and widgets
unfortunately but we did talk about some

00:35:59.720 --> 00:35:59.730
unfortunately but we did talk about some
 

00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.490
unfortunately but we did talk about some
of the things you can do like you can

00:36:01.490 --> 00:36:01.500
of the things you can do like you can
 

00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.350
of the things you can do like you can
actually allow for configuration of a

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:03.360
actually allow for configuration of a
 

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.210
actually allow for configuration of a
widget so you know one of the great

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220
widget so you know one of the great
 

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.890
widget so you know one of the great
things about widgets is that they let a

00:36:06.890 --> 00:36:06.900
things about widgets is that they let a
 

00:36:06.900 --> 00:36:08.900
things about widgets is that they let a
user take a bit of your app and put it

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:08.910
user take a bit of your app and put it
 

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.250
user take a bit of your app and put it
on their home screen one of the most

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:10.260
on their home screen one of the most
 

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.990
on their home screen one of the most
valuable pieces of real estate on their

00:36:11.990 --> 00:36:12.000
valuable pieces of real estate on their
 

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.330
valuable pieces of real estate on their
device and one of the best ways to have

00:36:14.330 --> 00:36:14.340
device and one of the best ways to have
 

00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.680
device and one of the best ways to have
a successful widget is to allow

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:15.690
a successful widget is to allow
 

00:36:15.690 --> 00:36:18.050
a successful widget is to allow
customization really let the user make

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:18.060
customization really let the user make
 

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.510
customization really let the user make
it their own we also talked about some

00:36:20.510 --> 00:36:20.520
it their own we also talked about some
 

00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.270
it their own we also talked about some
best practices for sizing basically when

00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280
best practices for sizing basically when
 

00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.290
best practices for sizing basically when
you're when you're designing the layout

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300
you're when you're designing the layout
 

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.450
you're when you're designing the layout
for a widget we talked about some

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:26.460
for a widget we talked about some
 

00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.370
for a widget we talked about some
formulas you can use to roughly figure

00:36:28.370 --> 00:36:28.380
formulas you can use to roughly figure
 

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.040
formulas you can use to roughly figure
out how big it should be I think one of

00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:31.050
out how big it should be I think one of
 

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:32.240
out how big it should be I think one of
the most important things we touched on

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:32.250
the most important things we touched on
 

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:33.770
the most important things we touched on
there which perhaps isn't quite as

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:33.780
there which perhaps isn't quite as
 

00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:35.540
there which perhaps isn't quite as
well-documented as I'd like that in our

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:35.550
well-documented as I'd like that in our
 

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.910
well-documented as I'd like that in our
design guidelines it is the fact that

00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920
design guidelines it is the fact that
 

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.740
design guidelines it is the fact that
you're sharing at some real estate so

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:39.750
you're sharing at some real estate so
 

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.440
you're sharing at some real estate so
you know why your app has the full range

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:42.450
you know why your app has the full range
 

00:36:42.450 --> 00:36:44.420
you know why your app has the full range
of expression of its brand and so forth

00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:44.430
of expression of its brand and so forth
 

00:36:44.430 --> 00:36:46.280
of expression of its brand and so forth
you when it's taking over the whole

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:46.290
you when it's taking over the whole
 

00:36:46.290 --> 00:36:48.470
you when it's taking over the whole
screen when you creating a widget you

00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480
screen when you creating a widget you
 

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.720
screen when you creating a widget you
have to turn there in mind the context

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:50.730
have to turn there in mind the context
 

00:36:50.730 --> 00:36:51.800
have to turn there in mind the context
it will be presented next to other

00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:51.810
it will be presented next to other
 

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:53.600
it will be presented next to other
widget or app icon so I think that was a

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:53.610
widget or app icon so I think that was a
 

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:55.670
widget or app icon so I think that was a
really important section in that episode

00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680
really important section in that episode
 

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.710
really important section in that episode
it's how you could design your you all

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720
it's how you could design your you all
 

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.480
it's how you could design your you all
widgets so that it will go along with

00:36:59.480 --> 00:36:59.490
widgets so that it will go along with
 

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.240
widgets so that it will go along with
those other and homescreen items yeah

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:02.250
those other and homescreen items yeah
 

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:04.100
those other and homescreen items yeah
the specifically the visual design of

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:04.110
the specifically the visual design of
 

00:37:04.110 --> 00:37:06.020
the specifically the visual design of
the widget it's more important to be on

00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:06.030
the widget it's more important to be on
 

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:07.700
the widget it's more important to be on
that slider of branding and consistency

00:37:07.700 --> 00:37:07.710
that slider of branding and consistency
 

00:37:07.710 --> 00:37:10.610
that slider of branding and consistency
more important than in your app to be

00:37:10.610 --> 00:37:10.620
more important than in your app to be
 

00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:13.580
more important than in your app to be
closer to the Android and holo end of

00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:13.590
closer to the Android and holo end of
 

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:15.410
closer to the Android and holo end of
that spectrum when you're designing a

00:37:15.410 --> 00:37:15.420
that spectrum when you're designing a
 

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:16.970
that spectrum when you're designing a
widget because it's next to everything

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980
widget because it's next to everything
 

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:19.100
widget because it's next to everything
else yeah but we love widgets you can

00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:19.110
else yeah but we love widgets you can
 

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:21.380
else yeah but we love widgets you can
make an app stand out and like a really

00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:21.390
make an app stand out and like a really
 

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.530
make an app stand out and like a really
differentiate your app from Wow

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:23.540
differentiate your app from Wow
 

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.230
differentiate your app from Wow
alright moving on we did a little bit of

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240
alright moving on we did a little bit of
 

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:28.970
alright moving on we did a little bit of
in this section where we talked about

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980
in this section where we talked about
 

00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.980
in this section where we talked about
the i/o app in the episode where we

00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:30.990
the i/o app in the episode where we
 

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:32.330
the i/o app in the episode where we
talked about the i/o app we also talked

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:32.340
talked about the i/o app we also talked
 

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:35.480
talked about the i/o app we also talked
about sharing and fullscreen UI's so

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:35.490
about sharing and fullscreen UI's so
 

00:37:35.490 --> 00:37:37.190
about sharing and fullscreen UI's so
sharing I'm not gonna get into too much

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200
sharing I'm not gonna get into too much
 

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.810
sharing I'm not gonna get into too much
depth here but you know we talked about

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820
depth here but you know we talked about
 

00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:40.070
depth here but you know we talked about
the different ways in which you can

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:40.080
the different ways in which you can
 

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.740
the different ways in which you can
allow users to share content things like

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:42.750
allow users to share content things like
 

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.690
allow users to share content things like
the the shared dialogue that's very

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:44.700
the the shared dialogue that's very
 

00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.030
the the shared dialogue that's very
standard things like the share action

00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040
standard things like the share action
 

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.340
standard things like the share action
provider in the action

00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:48.350
provider in the action
 

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:50.980
provider in the action
the idea here is the big message here is

00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:50.990
the idea here is the big message here is
 

00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.290
the idea here is the big message here is
that you should really allow sharing to

00:37:53.290 --> 00:37:53.300
that you should really allow sharing to
 

00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:55.630
that you should really allow sharing to
anything that's on the user's device not

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:55.640
anything that's on the user's device not
 

00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:58.210
anything that's on the user's device not
just specifically to you know like a to

00:37:58.210 --> 00:37:58.220
just specifically to you know like a to
 

00:37:58.220 --> 00:37:59.500
just specifically to you know like a to
social networks or one social network

00:37:59.500 --> 00:37:59.510
social networks or one social network
 

00:37:59.510 --> 00:38:01.590
social networks or one social network
you should really kind of use whatever

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:01.600
you should really kind of use whatever
 

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:04.330
you should really kind of use whatever
the system has installed so keep that in

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:04.340
the system has installed so keep that in
 

00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.920
the system has installed so keep that in
mind when designing sharing you eyes in

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:05.930
mind when designing sharing you eyes in
 

00:38:05.930 --> 00:38:08.260
mind when designing sharing you eyes in
the fullscreen

00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:08.270
the fullscreen
 

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:11.950
the fullscreen
I guess area we talked about system bars

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:11.960
I guess area we talked about system bars
 

00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:13.510
I guess area we talked about system bars
things like the status bar in the

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:13.520
things like the status bar in the
 

00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.510
things like the status bar in the
navigation bar and then we talked a

00:38:16.510 --> 00:38:16.520
navigation bar and then we talked a
 

00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.300
navigation bar and then we talked a
whole bunch about different interesting

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:19.310
whole bunch about different interesting
 

00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:21.210
whole bunch about different interesting
ways in which you can use those bars

00:38:21.210 --> 00:38:21.220
ways in which you can use those bars
 

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.240
ways in which you can use those bars
having like an overlaid action bar or

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.250
having like an overlaid action bar or
 

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.170
having like an overlaid action bar or
dimming out the status bar in a

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:26.180
dimming out the status bar in a
 

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.660

00:41:51.799 --> 00:41:53.440
under design pie and take a look at
typography and literally build it up

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:53.450
typography and literally build it up
 

00:41:53.450 --> 00:41:56.079

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:16.590
and really in like breaks down how we go
 

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.460

about improving your application yeah

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:19.470
about improving your application yeah
 

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:20.960
about improving your application yeah
and the one thing we try to do

00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:20.970
and the one thing we try to do
 

00:42:20.970 --> 00:42:22.580
and the one thing we try to do
throughout is talk about some of the

00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:22.590
throughout is talk about some of the
 

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:24.740
throughout is talk about some of the
developer features that we use so in the

00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:24.750
developer features that we use so in the
 

00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:26.120
developer features that we use so in the
bottom-right of a lot of the slides

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.130
bottom-right of a lot of the slides
 

00:42:26.130 --> 00:42:28.100
bottom-right of a lot of the slides
there's a little kind of for developers

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:28.110
there's a little kind of for developers
 

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.210
there's a little kind of for developers
note so keep that in mind if your

00:42:29.210 --> 00:42:29.220
note so keep that in mind if your
 

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:32.780
note so keep that in mind if your
developer yeah absolutely

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:32.790
developer yeah absolutely

developer yeah absolutely
next episode we don't want to talk about

00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220
next episode we don't want to talk about
 

00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.250
next episode we don't want to talk about
is in February we took a look at

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:37.260
is in February we took a look at
 

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.280
is in February we took a look at
football not soccer football apps if

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:40.290
football not soccer football apps if
 

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:42.320
football not soccer football apps if
they're the application logical addict's

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:42.330
they're the application logical addict's
 

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:45.980
they're the application logical addict's
and we reimagined what it could look

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:45.990
and we reimagined what it could look
 

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:47.660
and we reimagined what it could look
like by applying some more of the

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:47.670
like by applying some more of the
 

00:42:47.670 --> 00:42:50.240
like by applying some more of the
Android design guidelines so we did a

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:50.250
Android design guidelines so we did a
 

00:42:50.250 --> 00:42:51.650
Android design guidelines so we did a
lot of things we know we do like kind of

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:51.660
lot of things we know we do like kind of
 

00:42:51.660 --> 00:42:53.870
lot of things we know we do like kind of
applying more Android II kind of flatter

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880
applying more Android II kind of flatter
 

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.270
applying more Android II kind of flatter
look and feel and using action bars and

00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280
look and feel and using action bars and
 

00:42:56.280 --> 00:43:00.440
look and feel and using action bars and
and so forth which I think instantly you

00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:00.450
and so forth which I think instantly you
 

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:01.700
and so forth which I think instantly you
know it made it look more like an

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:01.710
know it made it look more like an
 

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:03.140
know it made it look more like an
Android app to me and made it

00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.150
Android app to me and made it
 

00:43:03.150 --> 00:43:05.750
Android app to me and made it
communicate its purpose its interaction

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:05.760
communicate its purpose its interaction
 

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.120
communicate its purpose its interaction
patterns much clearer for me and after

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:08.130
patterns much clearer for me and after
 

00:43:08.130 --> 00:43:10.790
patterns much clearer for me and after
the redesign some of that and but the

00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800
the redesign some of that and but the
 

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.500
the redesign some of that and but the
two two things I wanted to mostly pull

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:12.510
two two things I wanted to mostly pull
 

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:14.030
two two things I wanted to mostly pull
out here and they're kind of slightly

00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040
out here and they're kind of slightly
 

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:17.000
out here and they're kind of slightly
larger pitches are and I really enjoyed

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:17.010
larger pitches are and I really enjoyed
 

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:18.980
larger pitches are and I really enjoyed
the little with this redesign taking a

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:18.990
the little with this redesign taking a
 

00:43:18.990 --> 00:43:21.050
the little with this redesign taking a
look at the navigation and the way the

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:21.060
look at the navigation and the way the
 

00:43:21.060 --> 00:43:22.730
look at the navigation and the way the
major navigation was organized because

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:22.740
major navigation was organized because
 

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.310
major navigation was organized because
they were pretty using a draw which kind

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:25.320
they were pretty using a draw which kind
 

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:27.320
they were pretty using a draw which kind
of seemed to you know there wasn't too

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:27.330
of seemed to you know there wasn't too
 

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:28.730
of seemed to you know there wasn't too
many major sections to this application

00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740
many major sections to this application
 

00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.660
many major sections to this application
and so by kind of flattening down there

00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:32.670
and so by kind of flattening down there
 

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.340
and so by kind of flattening down there
the current navigation hierarchy we were

00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:34.350
the current navigation hierarchy we were
 

00:43:34.350 --> 00:43:36.380
the current navigation hierarchy we were
able to move it over to you using a tab

00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:36.390
able to move it over to you using a tab
 

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:38.150
able to move it over to you using a tab
based interface with lesser use punch

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160
based interface with lesser use punch
 

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.270
based interface with lesser use punch
and tucks away under the overflow like

00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280
and tucks away under the overflow like
 

00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.790
and tucks away under the overflow like
settings and and that instantly was much

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800
settings and and that instantly was much
 

00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.620
settings and and that instantly was much
clearer I think you know if you can use

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:45.630
clearer I think you know if you can use
 

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.750
clearer I think you know if you can use
a tab based navigation which immediately

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:47.760
a tab based navigation which immediately
 

00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.900
a tab based navigation which immediately
communicates the gasps purpose to user

00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:49.910
communicates the gasps purpose to user
 

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.910
communicates the gasps purpose to user
or a using here or so using the action

00:43:52.910 --> 00:43:52.920
or a using here or so using the action
 

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:55.490
or a using here or so using the action
bar spinner so not tabs then I thought

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:55.500
bar spinner so not tabs then I thought
 

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.040
bar spinner so not tabs then I thought
this was a great you know a great

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:57.050
this was a great you know a great
 

00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:59.450
this was a great you know a great
stepping back exercise and not using a

00:43:59.450 --> 00:43:59.460
stepping back exercise and not using a
 

00:43:59.460 --> 00:44:01.250
stepping back exercise and not using a
drawer just because it's attractable in

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:01.260
drawer just because it's attractable in
 

00:44:01.260 --> 00:44:03.200
drawer just because it's attractable in
new hotness but actually thinking of the

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:03.210
new hotness but actually thinking of the
 

00:44:03.210 --> 00:44:04.670
new hotness but actually thinking of the
simplest way to communicate a section

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680
simplest way to communicate a section
 

00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:06.500
simplest way to communicate a section
yeah that was really fun

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:06.510
yeah that was really fun
 

00:44:06.510 --> 00:44:08.450
yeah that was really fun
yeah one of my favorite parts of this we

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:08.460
yeah one of my favorite parts of this we
 

00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:11.140
yeah one of my favorite parts of this we
also did a bit with the color scheme you

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:11.150
also did a bit with the color scheme you
 

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:14.540
also did a bit with the color scheme you
know we talk a lot about single accent

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:14.550
know we talk a lot about single accent
 

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:16.250
know we talk a lot about single accent
colors like a lot of the play properties

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:16.260
colors like a lot of the play properties
 

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:19.070
colors like a lot of the play properties
use a single accent color in this case

00:44:19.070 --> 00:44:19.080
use a single accent color in this case
 

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:20.720
use a single accent color in this case
we actually in the redesign we decided

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:20.730
we actually in the redesign we decided
 

00:44:20.730 --> 00:44:24.200
we actually in the redesign we decided
to use two accent colors this kind of is

00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:24.210
to use two accent colors this kind of is
 

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.140
to use two accent colors this kind of is
I guess D saturated dark brown and a

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:27.150
I guess D saturated dark brown and a
 

00:44:27.150 --> 00:44:29.510
I guess D saturated dark brown and a
almost like a forest green so you know

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520
almost like a forest green so you know
 

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.070
almost like a forest green so you know
don't feel like you should be limited to

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:31.080
don't feel like you should be limited to
 

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.920
don't feel like you should be limited to
a single accent color you know if it

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:33.930
a single accent color you know if it
 

00:44:33.930 --> 00:44:35.300
a single accent color you know if it
makes sense for your app to use to

00:44:35.300 --> 00:44:35.310
makes sense for your app to use to
 

00:44:35.310 --> 00:44:37.100
makes sense for your app to use to
accent colors absolutely feel free to do

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:37.110
accent colors absolutely feel free to do
 

00:44:37.110 --> 00:44:38.810
accent colors absolutely feel free to do
that here's just one example of how we

00:44:38.810 --> 00:44:38.820
that here's just one example of how we
 

00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:46.250
that here's just one example of how we
did that yeah moving on so in March we

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:46.260
did that yeah moving on so in March we
 

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.410
did that yeah moving on so in March we
took a look at and how you might create

00:44:48.410 --> 00:44:48.420
took a look at and how you might create
 

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:50.750
took a look at and how you might create
a hypothetical newsreader so we've built

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760
a hypothetical newsreader so we've built
 

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.480
a hypothetical newsreader so we've built
on top of this kind of XYZ this meaty

00:44:53.480 --> 00:44:53.490
on top of this kind of XYZ this meaty
 

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:56.270
on top of this kind of XYZ this meaty
reader and explore some interesting ways

00:44:56.270 --> 00:44:56.280
reader and explore some interesting ways
 

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.370
reader and explore some interesting ways
in which you can you know do news

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:58.380
in which you can you know do news
 

00:44:58.380 --> 00:45:01.490
in which you can you know do news
reading experiences so some fun stuff

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500
reading experiences so some fun stuff
 

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.260
reading experiences so some fun stuff
explorations in there things like using

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:03.270
explorations in there things like using
 

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:06.110
explorations in there things like using
multi multi-finger gestures in order to

00:45:06.110 --> 00:45:06.120
multi multi-finger gestures in order to
 

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.420
multi multi-finger gestures in order to
kind of keep more content leading to

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:08.430
kind of keep more content leading to
 

00:45:08.430 --> 00:45:09.680
kind of keep more content leading to
connect you know the lighter-weight

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:09.690
connect you know the lighter-weight
 

00:45:09.690 --> 00:45:12.200
connect you know the lighter-weight
process and so forth I was really

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.210
process and so forth I was really
 

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:15.680
process and so forth I was really
interested in the use of search to

00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:15.690
interested in the use of search to
 

00:45:15.690 --> 00:45:17.150
interested in the use of search to
flatten the hierarchy of what I was

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160
flatten the hierarchy of what I was
 

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:19.370

markup was done before we had the
 

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.870
markup was done before we had the
official navigation drawer pattern so

00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880
official navigation drawer pattern so
 

00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.690
official navigation drawer pattern so
some of the markups some of the designs

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700
some of the markups some of the designs
 

00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.180

you see here are actually not quite up

00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:44.190
you see here are actually not quite up
 

00:45:44.190 --> 00:45:46.040

the UI and I thought that was really fun

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:27.510
the UI and I thought that was really fun
 

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.240

to kind of like really really have a

00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:29.250
to kind of like really really have a
 

00:46:29.250 --> 00:46:31.070

laser focused application and that was

00:46:31.070 --> 00:46:31.080
laser focused application and that was
 

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:36.520
laser focused application and that was
good yep next up was

00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:36.530
good yep next up was
 

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.370
good yep next up was
sowed in March where we took a look at

00:46:39.370 --> 00:46:39.380
sowed in March where we took a look at
 

00:46:39.380 --> 00:46:41.920
sowed in March where we took a look at
what a hypothetical podcast creator app

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:41.930
what a hypothetical podcast creator app
 

00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:45.700
what a hypothetical podcast creator app
might look like so this was an app where

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:45.710
might look like so this was an app where
 

00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:48.700
might look like so this was an app where
we kind of mocked up and design but

00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:48.710
we kind of mocked up and design but
 

00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:50.260
we kind of mocked up and design but
stepping back from that I really enjoyed

00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:50.270
stepping back from that I really enjoyed
 

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:52.210
stepping back from that I really enjoyed
that we started from kind of a stage

00:46:52.210 --> 00:46:52.220
that we started from kind of a stage
 

00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:54.610
that we started from kind of a stage
before the mock-ups and redesigns if you

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:54.620
before the mock-ups and redesigns if you
 

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:56.110
before the mock-ups and redesigns if you
will we started from the information

00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:56.120
will we started from the information
 

00:46:56.120 --> 00:46:58.660
will we started from the information
hierarchy and really kinda like took

00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:58.670
hierarchy and really kinda like took
 

00:46:58.670 --> 00:47:00.190
hierarchy and really kinda like took
some time to think about what it was

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:00.200
some time to think about what it was
 

00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:02.740
some time to think about what it was
that was trying to achieve and how that

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:02.750
that was trying to achieve and how that
 

00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:05.290
that was trying to achieve and how that
would influence us to the screen design

00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:05.300
would influence us to the screen design
 

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.240
would influence us to the screen design
later on so I really enjoyed that we

00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:07.250
later on so I really enjoyed that we
 

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.460
later on so I really enjoyed that we
kept an information model and in fact we

00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:09.470
kept an information model and in fact we
 

00:47:09.470 --> 00:47:11.170
kept an information model and in fact we
use the labels throughout the design to

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:11.180
use the labels throughout the design to
 

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:12.520
use the labels throughout the design to
show which screens were ticking off

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:12.530
show which screens were ticking off
 

00:47:12.530 --> 00:47:14.740
show which screens were ticking off
certain use cases we were trying to try

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:14.750
certain use cases we were trying to try
 

00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:18.760
certain use cases we were trying to try
to cover off so that was a plan for so

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:18.770
to cover off so that was a plan for so
 

00:47:18.770 --> 00:47:20.110
to cover off so that was a plan for so
which I'm helping I was there for but I

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:20.120
which I'm helping I was there for but I
 

00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:23.970
which I'm helping I was there for but I
didn't enjoy your watching him moving on

00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:23.980
didn't enjoy your watching him moving on
 

00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:28.270
didn't enjoy your watching him moving on
yeah moving on in July we took a look at

00:47:28.270 --> 00:47:28.280
yeah moving on in July we took a look at
 

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:32.380
yeah moving on in July we took a look at
an application called cenotes and this

00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:32.390
an application called cenotes and this
 

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:35.350
an application called cenotes and this
is actually from GDG Oslo I believe we

00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:35.360
is actually from GDG Oslo I believe we
 

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.690
is actually from GDG Oslo I believe we
we did kind of a live app clinic I guess

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:37.700
we did kind of a live app clinic I guess
 

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:40.600
we did kind of a live app clinic I guess
with with the creators of the SAP and

00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:40.610
with with the creators of the SAP and
 

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:42.700
with with the creators of the SAP and
then they were like hey can you show us

00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:42.710
then they were like hey can you show us
 

00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:44.830
then they were like hey can you show us
some ideas and show some mock-ups of

00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:44.840
some ideas and show some mock-ups of
 

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.710
some ideas and show some mock-ups of
what you how you would design this so we

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:47.720
what you how you would design this so we
 

00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.200
what you how you would design this so we
went ahead and did that yeah that was a

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:50.210
went ahead and did that yeah that was a
 

00:47:50.210 --> 00:47:51.880
went ahead and did that yeah that was a
fun one so I think there was some really

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:51.890
fun one so I think there was some really
 

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.850
fun one so I think there was some really
nice work done to better express the

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:54.860
nice work done to better express the
 

00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.500
nice work done to better express the
kind of information hierarchy seemed in

00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:56.510
kind of information hierarchy seemed in
 

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.710
kind of information hierarchy seemed in
general reorganization there as well as

00:47:59.710 --> 00:47:59.720
general reorganization there as well as
 

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.140
general reorganization there as well as
I'm moving some of the kind of interface

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:02.150
I'm moving some of the kind of interface
 

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:03.490
I'm moving some of the kind of interface
patterns like the action bar the

00:48:03.490 --> 00:48:03.500
patterns like the action bar the
 

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:07.540
patterns like the action bar the
navigation draw a bit closer to the you

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:07.550
navigation draw a bit closer to the you
 

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:09.100
navigation draw a bit closer to the you
know the platform pattern in order to

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:09.110
know the platform pattern in order to
 

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:11.710
know the platform pattern in order to
kind of make them feel more intuitive so

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:11.720
kind of make them feel more intuitive so
 

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.090
kind of make them feel more intuitive so
that users kind of kind of pick up the

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:13.100
that users kind of kind of pick up the
 

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:14.260
that users kind of kind of pick up the
application and know how to navigate

00:48:14.260 --> 00:48:14.270
application and know how to navigate
 

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:15.610
application and know how to navigate
around which I thought was really nice

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:15.620
around which I thought was really nice
 

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:17.020
around which I thought was really nice
but the one thing I wanted to highlight

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:17.030
but the one thing I wanted to highlight
 

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:19.060
but the one thing I wanted to highlight
a misapplication and we touched on it

00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:19.070
a misapplication and we touched on it
 

00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:21.310
a misapplication and we touched on it
recent edge is a couple seconds minutes

00:48:21.310 --> 00:48:21.320
recent edge is a couple seconds minutes
 

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.210

collections with the use of the

00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:24.110
collections with the use of the
 

00:48:24.110 --> 00:48:26.080
collections with the use of the
right-side trough the sorting option so

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:26.090
right-side trough the sorting option so
 

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.480

I very much enjoyed this I think this is

00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:28.490
I very much enjoyed this I think this is
 

00:48:28.490 --> 00:48:32.140
I very much enjoyed this I think this is
a great way to kind of bundle up and

00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:32.150
a great way to kind of bundle up and
 

00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:34.000
a great way to kind of bundle up and
different your sorting options and it

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:34.010
different your sorting options and it
 

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:35.410
different your sorting options and it
can feel like a lighter weight action

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:35.420
can feel like a lighter weight action
 

00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.510
can feel like a lighter weight action
rather than taking users off to a second

screen or a dialog perhaps so letting
 

00:48:40.970 --> 00:48:43.750
screen or a dialog perhaps so letting
them kind of set their sorting options

00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760
them kind of set their sorting options
 

00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.700
them kind of set their sorting options
and and better yet if you can have them

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:45.710
and and better yet if you can have them
 

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:47.860
and and better yet if you can have them
say updating the background so you can

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:47.870
say updating the background so you can
 

00:48:47.870 --> 00:48:49.510

if I could see the number of results
 

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:52.660
if I could see the number of results
like changing the background I think

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:52.670
like changing the background I think
 

00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:54.340
like changing the background I think
it's a really really nice way to make it

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:54.350
it's a really really nice way to make it

his ideal sports app and how you would
build it and but we then picked up the

00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:30.440
build it and but we then picked up the
 

00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.109
build it and but we then picked up the
ball off the pin and then talk about how

00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119
ball off the pin and then talk about how
 

00:49:32.119 --> 00:49:34.000

process we took this step and this

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:39.830
process we took this step and this
 

00:49:39.830 --> 00:49:42.010
process we took this step and this
application step by step so we looked at

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:42.020
application step by step so we looked at
 

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.410
application step by step so we looked at
you know the information density and the

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:44.420
you know the information density and the
 

00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.570
you know the information density and the
typography and the visual theming and so

00:49:50.980 --> 00:49:50.990
through why we were making the changes
 

00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:52.359
through why we were making the changes
and how you change them and then we kind

00:49:52.359 --> 00:49:52.369
and how you change them and then we kind
 

00:49:52.369 --> 00:49:54.400
and how you change them and then we kind
of went one step further as well and

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:54.410
of went one step further as well and

principles and thinking about your
 

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:31.210
principles and thinking about your
information model and how you flesh it

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:31.220
information model and how you flesh it
 

00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:33.430
information model and how you flesh it
out and kind of take the process of

00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440
out and kind of take the process of
 

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.810
out and kind of take the process of
taking that and turning it into use

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:34.820
taking that and turning it into use
 

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.670
taking that and turning it into use
cases and then it's kind of like and

00:51:36.670 --> 00:51:36.680
