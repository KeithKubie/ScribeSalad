00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.579
&gt;&gt; Creating a texture atlas is actually a very tricky engineering task. Texture

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:09.162
packing is a type of bin packing problem that has been proved to be np hard. The

00:00:09.162 --> 00:00:13.782
problem is so challenging, that I frequently use a variant of this algorithm as

00:00:13.782 --> 00:00:18.402
an interview question to evaluate the skill of potential hires, GRITS, rather

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:23.240
writing our own version of texture packing. Grits uses texture packer, which is

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.893
a great off-the-shelf tool that fits into most content pipelines quickly. It

00:00:27.893 --> 00:00:32.372
will generate the atlas data given a list of loose textures, alongside a data

00:00:32.372 --> 00:00:36.853
file, that maps the individual source images to their final locations in the

00:00:36.853 --> 00:00:37.335
atlas.
