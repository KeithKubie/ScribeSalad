00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.190
One of the most useful questions to ask
when you're building a low fidelity

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:03.780
prototype.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.235
Is whether a user can easily make the
app do the thing it's supposed to do.

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:10.550
This may sound like a very
basic question, and it is.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.240
But it's actually the most vital
thing to ask at this point.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.830
For instance, one of the things
a user might want to do in

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.150
our example app is check off
a task they've completed.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.880
We need to think about how a user will
achieve this task from the starting

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.440
point of, I have opened this app.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.360
For a first time user, we may need
to have an instruction screen, but

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.130
in general there are three common
patterns for dealing with user flow.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.450
The first is to have an app
that does only one thing and

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.460
so only have that one screen.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.589
A good example of this is
your common calculator app.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.230
The second is to have a main screen
that functions as a menu of options for

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.720
various things the user
can do in the app.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.690
And then have each task
occur on its own screen.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.650
Finally, you can have the first
screen of the app be a place where

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.630
the users can complete the most
common task the app will be used for.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.960
And have a secondary screen for
the menu.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.140
So, in our case,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.820
we can't use the first pattern since
our app has multiple functions.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.980
That leaves us with a choice between a
user flow which starts on a menu screen.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.230
And having a user flow which starts on
a screen on which the user can check

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.970
off tasks.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.130
As time has gone on, the second
pattern has become much more common.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.000
It is generally better to be able to
isolate the most common use cases and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.880
have those achievable from
the main screen like this.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.020
For the same reason,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.990
mobile notifications are best when the
user can perform some action directly

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.630
from the notification,
without opening the app itself.
