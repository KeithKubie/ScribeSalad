00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:08.630
SPEAKER: Thanks everyone for
joining us this afternoon

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.220
for "Building on What's Good:
A New Way to Fight Poverty."

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.030
This afternoon we
welcome Jose Quinonez

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.380
as a speaker for
Talks at Google.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.310
I'm proud to say Jose is
a personal friend of mine

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.800
and has recently won what's
called the MacArthur Award.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.137
Welcome Jose.

00:00:29.137 --> 00:00:30.628
JOSE QUINONEZ: Great, thank you.

00:00:30.628 --> 00:00:32.119
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.430
Thanks for making time to come
and be a part of the talks.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.010
I mean, it really is
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.720
Very excited to
get the invitation

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.780
to kind of share with
you some of our learnings

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.870
and in our work in poverty.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.910
Before I start getting
into our actual work,

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.790
I did want to share
some of my story

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.766
and even kind of addressing
some of the political climate

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:02.640
of the day because it
actually it all impacts

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.395
a lot of the work that we do.

00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:05.910
You know, I'm an immigrant.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.780
I came to this country when I
was nine years old back in 1980

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.790
along with my five siblings.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.580
The oldest at that time was 15
and the youngest kid was seven.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.270
I'm the second to the youngest.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.140
And I do remember crossing
the US-Mexico border

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.110
in the dark of night.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.560
And it was actually
July 4th of 1980

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.470
when we actually
crossed at night.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.360
We were shepherded through
the border into Tijuana.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.980
And I remember actually feeling
very, very afraid as a kid,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:38.850
not knowing what the
future had in store for us.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.020
I mean I had no idea while we
we were making that happen.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.880
But that happened.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.370
That happened to me in my
life and in my family's life.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.620
And eventually, after
crossing, we actually

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.570
made our way all
the way to San Jose

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.120
that's when we had
extended family

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.950
that we were able to live with.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.880
And for the first couple of
years of living with them--

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.430
and I remember being
told repeatedly

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.760
to not talk about our
situation with anybody.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.581
I think I started
in fourth grade

00:02:07.581 --> 00:02:09.539
and they even told us to
not tell our teachers.

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.100
Don't tell anybody what is
happening with our family.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.860
And so we learned
to kind of be quiet,

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.930
to kind if live in the
shadows and not make--

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.360
not be visible in
society at all.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.370
But luckily in 1986 President
Reagan, at that time,

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.700
actually signed a bill that
actually gave immigrants like

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.510
my family-- myself
and my family--

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:35.750
amnesty.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.070
The bill in 1986
said that anybody

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.190
that came to this
country before 1982

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.310
were granted amnesty basically.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.820
So we had to apply and then
we were given temporary status

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.050
for a couple of years.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.930
And after that temporary
status, we got a green card.

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.980
And after the green card we were
eligible to become citizens.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.690
And so in '86 I remember
feeling the shadow

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.390
kind of lifting from our lives.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.720
And for us-- really
kind of un-shackling us

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.805
so that we can actually
live the full--

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:13.440
our full lives to the fullest.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.790
Right?

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.950
And so that was really
important because

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.710
without that I don't
think I would have been

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.261
able to do anything in
my professional life,

00:03:22.261 --> 00:03:24.510
and I don't think I would
have been able to stand here

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.550
before you and talking
to you about my story

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.770
and what we've done with
the Mission Asset Fund.

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.490
I think this is a type
of story that, I'm sure,

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.540
many of you as immigrants can
probably tell that yourselves.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.390
And I'm sure many of us have
heard stories like that where

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.420
a nine-year-old boy or
five-year-old kid can come

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.350
to this country and work hard
and have availed themselves

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.930
a lot of opportunities that we
have in our country and make

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.840
something of themselves to the
point that, professionally,

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.260
they can get to the point
of actually getting awarded

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.850
the MacArthur Fellowship--

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.910
which is one of
the highest honors

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:02.710
in our professional life.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.220
And that is pretty
typical, right?

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.060
And I don't really think
that's a very unique story,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.660
but it is my story.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.310
And it's a story that I think
now, more important than ever,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.010
that is to be said.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.600
Now is more important than ever
for us to actually share those

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.420
stories because in my mind it
is those stories that actually--

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.230
that really do signify why--

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.600
what really does
make America great.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.440
And it is about allowing
people to really truly develop

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:32.200
their full human and
economic potential

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.600
and then give back
into society likewise.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.234
So I was very fortunate for
having been able to do that.

00:04:40.234 --> 00:04:41.650
But again, I want
to sort of share

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.025
the story-- start
with that story

00:04:43.025 --> 00:04:47.170
because in nowadays-- as you
know-- in the past two weeks,

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.810
under the new current
administration, all that

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.070
will hold true and dear in
what we believe America to be

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.460
is actually being under attack.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.670
And I'm concerned,
not just for myself,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.360
but for my family and the
communities that we work with.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.750
And so this is the time
to actually, I think,

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.420
that we need to, again, speak
out more and more than ever.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.860
So having said that, I do
want to sort of tell you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.560
more or less about what it is
that we do at the Mission Asset

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.250
Fund and why it was that we were
awarded a MacArthur Fellowship.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.000
The MacArthur Fellowship,
just to clarify,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.370
is not something
that you apply for.

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.960
it's something that actually--
they just called and said

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.940
you get this thing.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.020
You don't apply.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.030
You don't-- you can't even
refer somebody else to apply.

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.240
It's sort of like they
sort of select you

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.580
for the creativity that--

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.320
and also the trajectory
of your work.

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.270
So it was a pretty big honor.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.210
But I want to sort of give
you a sense of why that is

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.910
and why that happened
by giving you

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.710
more insights into our work.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.370
And really I also want--
if you take away anything

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.440
from this conversation
I want you

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.610
to sort of to think
about this is that really

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.050
the underpinning of our work
is to work with low income

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.470
individuals to try to develop
their full financial potential

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:05.780
and really addressing
the issues of poverty.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.940
And so what we've learned
in that work is this,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.680
is that poverty is hard.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.710
It's hard to solve.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.500
It's really difficult actually.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.090
It's actually very complicated.

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.770
It's a very complicated issue.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.560
And I know that for a fact
that in the way that we've

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.700
been addressing the issue in the
past, we're not really doing--

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.800
we're not really
advancing the issue much.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.900
And so what we've learned
is that we need to innovate.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.650
We need to create new
programs, new ideas,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.130
test them out and really try
to find out what exactly is--

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:37.852
or what exactly works
in people's lives.

00:06:37.852 --> 00:06:40.310
And I think our work at the
Mission Asset Fund with lending

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.190
circles, primarily,
has become that example

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.690
in our national dialogue
on how to combat poverty.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.880
So I want to definitely
talk to you more about that.

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.120
But before that, I wanted
to show you a video

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.510
because we actually have a
deep relationship with Google.

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:00.390
Back in 2004 for
there was Bay Area--

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.460
2014.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.800
Sorry, I skipped
the decade there.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.500
2014, Google had a
make the better--

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.580
Bay Area better?

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.090
SPEAKER: Build a
better Bay Area.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.150
JOSE QUINONEZ: Build
a better Bay Area.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.470
And I think that
was the thing that

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:17.232
was like over 2000 people--

00:07:17.232 --> 00:07:18.560
SPEAKER: Oh, go ahead.

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:22.670
JOSE QUINONEZ: That was 2000,
I think, people applied--

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:26.060
organizations-- to get good
support for their work.

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:28.880
And we were fortunate to
actually be one of the top 10

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.690
organizations.

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:32.800
And because of that, Google
actually produced this video.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.720
And so I want to stop
there and kind of make

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.760
you watch it for just a minute.

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:42.002
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.000
JOSE QUINONEZ: My
name is Jose Quinonez.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.940
I'm the CEO of the
Mission Asset Fund.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.770
In the Bay Area
there are thousands

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:00.930
of families-- hardworking
families-- that

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.210
are in the financial
shadows, people that

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:06.990
are invisible to the credit
system, people that are stuck

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.190
with high costs-- predatory
products-- and people who

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:14.790
are really strapped and have
a hard time making ends meet.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:17.310
Our goal is to engage
thousands of families

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.580
and help them build their
financial capability by having

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:23.010
access to checking
accounts, by being

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.310
able to improve their credit
scores, create lending circles,

00:08:26.310 --> 00:08:30.490
and being able to even pay
down their high cost debt.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:32.220
And those are the
people that we actually

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:36.600
need to help empower with
access to the right tools

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:40.702
so that we can help them fulfill
their full economic potential.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:51.830
Great.

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:53.210
Thank you so much.

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.390
So that was, again a video
that was produced by--

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.410
in that competition.

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:59.350
And then we had our--

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:02.240
when that came out and we
did a whole campaign to get

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.870
people to actually vote for us.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:05.720
So it was a lot of
fun-- a lot of work--

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.660
but it was definitely a
lot of fun to engage in.

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.330
And we still use that
video to sort of, one,

00:09:11.330 --> 00:09:14.320
introduce the nature of our
work, why we do our work,

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.440
and again just to show some
fabulous shots of folks

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.760
living in the mission.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:23.240
So we started our
work back in 2007

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:26.562
in the Mission District working
with, and again, low income

00:09:26.562 --> 00:09:28.520
immigrants that are trying
to build and develop

00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.570
their financial capability.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.230
For us the question was--

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:35.330
while we knew-- soon enough
we found out that our target

00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:38.060
market, our target clients,
actually, by and large,

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.582
were actually-- where they
were considered unbanked--

00:09:40.582 --> 00:09:43.040
meaning that they didn't have
a checking account or savings

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.610
account.

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:47.010
I think like over 50% of
adults, immigrant adults,

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:50.360
in the neighborhood just
didn't have a checking account.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.270
And then we also learned
soon enough that about 44%

00:09:53.270 --> 00:09:55.430
of mission households--
this is, again,

00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:59.720
back in 2005 when
the study was made--

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:03.080
that 44% of mission households
did not have a credit score

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.490
or credit history.

00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:07.220
And so when we we're doing
our work I said, well,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.610
how do you actually
help people develop

00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.620
their financial capability
when, in fact, they didn't have

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.870
access to the most basic
tools to actually build

00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:17.240
their financial lives--

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.370
no checking account, no
savings account, and even

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.510
no credit score--

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:22.540
credit history.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.490
So we-- so that was the barriers
that we're trying to address.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.160
But soon enough,
too, we also realized

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.740
that that problem was
not just of people

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.790
living in the Mission District.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:36.380
Those problems of being
in the financial shadows

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:41.930
really resonants with people all
over the country to the point

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:45.980
where recently there was a
study by the Federal Reserve--

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.860
and its called "The Report on
the Economic Well-being of US

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.360
Households"-- in 2015 that
they found that a lot of people

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:53.900
inclu--

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:57.140
this is 22% of employed adults.

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:00.830
They found that 22% of employed
adults have multiple jobs

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:03.830
and they actually have
multiple informal jobs.

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:06.530
So these are people that
are working in the gig

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:08.005
economy, the Uber drivers.

00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:10.130
These are people that are
working the flea markets.

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.830
These are people that are
babysitting very informally

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:14.420
to try to make ends meet.

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:18.530
So imagine, one out of
every five working adults

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.200
have to contend with managing
their finances by working

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.370
in formal settings
where their incomes

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.350
can go up and down depending on
the day, depending on the week,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.211
depending on the
month, unlike us.

00:11:30.211 --> 00:11:30.710
Right?

00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.970
We know exactly how
much we're going

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.980
to be getting paid on
a month-to-month basis,

00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:35.120
on a year-to-year basis.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:37.610
We have this, sort of,
stability of income.

00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:40.670
But that's something that is
not the case for a lot of people

00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.770
in our world.

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:45.890
And so that actually
presents a challenge

00:11:45.890 --> 00:11:48.860
because the financial
instability that

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.010
comes with not being
able to predict

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:55.640
how you'll be making that day,
or that week, or that month--

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:01.250
people find the challenges of
actually managing their budgets

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:04.497
to the point where that same
report found that about a third

00:12:04.497 --> 00:12:06.080
of the people that
said that they work

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.800
in this type of informal
employment-- a third of them

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.680
actually say that they
struggle to actually pay

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.420
their bills because they
don't just experience what

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.040
is called income viability.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:21.590
But they also experience
a lot of volatility

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:22.900
in their expenses.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.864
And so it's actually gets
harder to manage their finances

00:12:25.864 --> 00:12:28.280
when they don't know exactly
how much they're going to get

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:31.210
or even how much they're
going to be paying out.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:32.510
So it's harder, right?

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:35.200
It's harder to manage
your life like that.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.280
And we also found,
even again, doing

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.010
more research about the
nature of poverty in our world

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:42.830
is that are a lot of
individuals actually

00:12:42.830 --> 00:12:46.250
find themselves stuck where
they're at, where they actually

00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:49.310
do not see themselves
living out what we call

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:51.320
the American dream anymore.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.750
The American dream,
defining that as,

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.590
your kid will do
better than you,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:13:00.100
or your offspring will do better
than the prior generation.

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.060
Where, in fact, back
in the 1940s the people

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:04.910
that were born in the 40s.

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:07.460
they earned more money
than their parents.

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:11.120
90 percent of people that
were born in the 40s--

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.290
does that make sense--

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.200
90% of people that
were born in the 1940s

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.690
made more money
than their parents.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:20.960
People that were born in
1980s, about 50% of them

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.040
can actually say that.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.380
So just in that measure
alone we actually

00:13:24.380 --> 00:13:27.200
can see how a lot of
people are just not

00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.070
even being able to realize this
idea of the American Dream.

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.860
And so they really are
stuck in where they're at.

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:42.110
And again, in this idea of not
being able to earn enough money

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:45.650
or even improve
economically in that sense,

00:13:45.650 --> 00:13:48.620
it really bears out when you
think about the discrepancies

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:52.030
of how we as an
economy have improved

00:13:52.030 --> 00:13:53.720
the level of productivity.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.890
And again, this is very highly
cited number where since 19--

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.050
I think in the past
three decades, I think--

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.240
starting in the
middle of 1970s--

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:06.170
that the level of productivity
has increased significantly

00:14:06.170 --> 00:14:09.680
from year to year to the point
that it increased by 73%.

00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.470
But at the same time
period, the level

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.760
of hourly pay for workers
that actually doing the work,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.790
their pay only increased by 11%.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:24.680
So there's this growing gap
of how we're, as an economy,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.220
increasing our productivity.

00:14:26.220 --> 00:14:28.810
But the people that are actually
working on an hourly basis,

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.380
they're not benefiting from
that level of productivity.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.790
So people are feeling strained.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:37.460
People are feeling, again,
like they can't make ends meet

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.600
and they know that
they're not living out

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.550
to their ideals of improving
their livelihoods based

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.230
on this idea of
the American Dream.

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.420
So people are struggling.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.740
And again, just another
statistic just to kind of bare

00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.280
that a little bit more is
that one in five Americans

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.180
have no credit or
checking accounts.

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.830
So this is not just
an issue, again,

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:58.280
folks in our community
in the Mission District,

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.630
but this is actually
happening across the country.

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:04.040
And so without access to those
basic products or services,

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.780
it just makes it
virtually impossible

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.980
for them to manage, or live
out, their financial potential.

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:13.970
And then that actually means
that people are paying more

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.460
for financial products, because
imagine if you don't have

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.700
a checking account and
you do get payed by check,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:25.590
you have to get that cashed
on a check cashing place.

00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:29.180
And they may charge you
3% or 4% on the dollar.

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:32.180
And so there was another study
that actually found that just

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.860
by looking at low
income families--

00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:37.250
these are people that are
making $24,000 or less, OK--

00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:39.980
across the country,
that when you

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:42.080
look at how they
spend that money,

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.990
they found that they were
actually paying about 10%

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:48.330
of that on fees for
financial products--

00:15:48.330 --> 00:15:50.610
like, again, cashing their
checks and so forth--

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:54.080
and interest, So they're
spending 10% of their money

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.330
to manage money.

00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:58.820
And it actually equals
about how much money

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:02.330
they're spending on groceries.

00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.580
I mean-- so just imagine that.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.740
I mean, if you're only making
$24,000 a year and 10% of that,

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.565
it actually kind of goes out
to pay the lender or the check

00:16:12.565 --> 00:16:13.940
casher store and
things like that

00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.460
just because you don't
have access to the products

00:16:16.460 --> 00:16:18.470
that you and I take for granted.

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.220
And of course, because of
that, budgets get strained.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.950
And they cannot save.

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.210
They can't invest.

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.470
It kind of gets even
more difficult to pay

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:34.080
for the day-to-day expenses.

00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.760
And rent alone, in large
extent, is actually

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.560
taking half of
people's annual income.

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.550
And there was a study that was
widely cited a couple of years

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:46.940
ago where they found that about
11 million Americans spend

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.460
half of their annual
income in rent alone.

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.047
I know that may not be
startling news for us

00:16:52.047 --> 00:16:53.630
here in the Bay Area
in San Francisco,

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.650
because you could
be middle income,

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:58.670
you could be a Googler,
right, and still you

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:00.530
have to pay a significant
amount on rent.

00:17:00.530 --> 00:17:02.660
I know that's the
case for us here.

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.180
But imagine, that's the
case for people and families

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:07.280
living in Kansas, or
living in Florida,

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.099
living in other places
that may not actually

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.700
have the benefit of having
a tech industry to rely on.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.200
And those people
really are hurting

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.010
when half of their money is
actually going to pay for rent.

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.781
So this is really-- and
I wanted to take the time

00:17:21.781 --> 00:17:23.780
to kind of let you paint
the picture about that.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:27.339
The nature of folks
stuck in poverty

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.820
is actually pretty dire.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:32.150
And they really are
grappling with things

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.010
that are really
beyond their control,

00:17:34.010 --> 00:17:38.480
really beyond their lives.

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.340
But the reality is that when
we build policies and programs,

00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:45.630
we sort of don't think
about that anymore.

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.400
We just sort of, like, look
at people that are poor

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.770
and sort of, kind of,
blame them for poverty.

00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:55.340
We sort of like say, hey, no,
something's wrong with you

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:58.250
because you're stuck
in poverty, or you're

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:00.972
doing something wrong, or
you it's really your fault.

00:18:00.972 --> 00:18:02.180
You didn't study hard enough.

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:05.050
You didn't go to
the right school,

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.490
or something is wrong
with you and that's why--

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:10.580
and we're going to leave
poverty at that level.

00:18:10.580 --> 00:18:12.810
And this is something
that most people

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:15.050
know-- folks call
the deficit model,

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:20.040
where we actually use a deficit
perspective to build policies

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.690
and services just so it
kind of addresses that.

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:27.230
But the fact is-- it's kind
of like blaming the victim,

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.490
blaming them for their issues
and not really recognizing

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:34.490
the sort of like the broader
economic forces at play

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:36.380
that people are contending with.

00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:39.140
And so this is something that we
wanted to sort of address head

00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:41.630
on and to basically say,
is there a different way

00:18:41.630 --> 00:18:44.840
of looking at this issue
rather than looking at it from

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:48.980
a deficit based-- again, that
holds people as deficient,

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:51.110
as ignorant, as
broken in some way--

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:53.510
and then looking at
people in a different way.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.840
So that way we can figure out
how we can best align ourselves

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.810
and best leverage what they
have and we work with people so

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:01.500
that we can actually
help them move

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:05.487
through their economic journey.

00:19:05.487 --> 00:19:07.820
And that's exactly what we
did at the Mission Asset Fund

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:11.270
where we came up with
a new frame, what

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:14.600
we call more like a
strength based approach,

00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.890
where we basically start with
the idea of respecting people.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.530
Imagine that.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:21.380
Isn't that a crazy idea?

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.740
Respecting people, sort of
acknowledging their dignity.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:25.452
Isn't that crazy?

00:19:25.452 --> 00:19:27.410
It's like starting a
conversation with somebody

00:19:27.410 --> 00:19:29.420
and saying, I
recognize your humanity

00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:31.300
because you're another person--

00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.680
that we start a
conversation based on that.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:35.240
But that's something
that we felt

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.610
we needed to
actually say verbally

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:40.950
so that we can make
that more of our thing

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.740
because it is
definitely not happening

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.440
within our current
political environment now.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.840
And also, by meeting people
where they're at, now where

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:50.330
we think they should be, or
where we want them to be.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.940
But reality is like
kind of appreciating

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.742
their barriers, their
pitfalls, the things

00:19:57.742 --> 00:19:58.950
that they're contending with.

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:01.550
But really it's about meeting
people where they're at.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.560
And it's also about
leveraging what they have.

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.260
It's about acknowledging that
we all have something of worth.

00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.080
We all have something good
to give and offer the people

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.530
and offer the world, and so
so by finding the thing that

00:20:12.530 --> 00:20:15.410
is good in people's lives is
then figuring out how can we

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:17.000
leverage that so
that that way we

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.800
can continue the
conversation with them

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:22.550
and really truly help them
move and improve their lives.

00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:25.790
So that is sort of the
frame that we sort of

00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:29.480
use to talk about the MAF
approach, if you will,

00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:36.320
and about how we think about
how we engage our clients.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.560
And so how we took
this idea and made

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.790
it immediately
applicable to our work

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:48.120
is by basically noting
that one of the things that

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.110
is very common within
the immigrant community

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:53.840
is this idea that people
actually do come together

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.320
to help each other.

00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:55.920
Imagine that?

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.590
This is not just
an immigrant thing.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.760
It truly is, like, is
a human thing, right?

00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:03.500
It's like, this what we've all
been doing for eons, right?

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:06.350
But people actually still do it.

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.510
And so in a sense--
from a financial sense,

00:21:08.510 --> 00:21:10.430
it's something that we
found that immigrants

00:21:10.430 --> 00:21:13.640
have this tradition of coming
together and to lending

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.230
and save money together.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:17.420
In Mexico this is
an activity that is

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:19.429
called the [SPEAKING SPANISH].

00:21:19.429 --> 00:21:21.220
All throughout the
Caribbean they call them

00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:22.110
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:21:22.110 --> 00:21:25.530
I mean they have this tradition
that happens all over the world

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.270
and comes in a lot
of different names.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.340
Now, but this is a
very informal practice.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.410
How many of you guys have
heard about this lending--

00:21:33.410 --> 00:21:35.590
well, I know you guys have.

00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:38.850
Well so this activity of
people lending each other is,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:40.260
again, is very common.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.870
But it is informal, right?

00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:44.850
So it's informal to the point
where only the people in that

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:47.820
circle are the ones that,
sort of, know who they are,

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.194
know who-- because it's
really based on this--

00:21:50.194 --> 00:21:52.610
the social trust that they
have with each other because it

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:56.610
mostly is each other's
neighbors, coworkers,

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.770
relatives, that they
sort of come together

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:00.070
to help each other out.

00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:03.830
But so, again, the activity
has been-- is widely known,

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:05.700
has been written on a lot.

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.150
But because it's informal,
the formal financial systems--

00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:10.590
the credit bureaus, the banks--

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.030
they had no idea about this.

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.360
We knew, right?

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.780
But the formal
system did not know.

00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.660
So what we did
was we figured out

00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:22.080
a way to actually make this
into a formal practice.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.280
And this is the genesis of
what we call lending circles.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.110
Well we found that
people in the circle--

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:30.310
let's say you can have
a group of 10 people,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.700
and each person puts in $100.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:35.190
So that group comes
up with $1,000, right?

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.522
And then everybody takes
$1,000 in on a monthly basis.

00:22:38.522 --> 00:22:40.230
And they do that in
rotation so everybody

00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:42.630
has a chance of getting $1,000.

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.400
So what we've
basically saw that is

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.800
like this was people
were making loans

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.840
and they were paying the
loans back every time

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.880
they put in $100.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:53.610
So we formalized the
activity by having

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:56.280
people sign a promissory
note basically saying,

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:59.730
I, Jose, promise to pay
$100 on a monthly basis

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.290
for that $1,000 loan.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:02.730
And then through that formal--

00:23:02.730 --> 00:23:05.940
that promissory note
it gave us then,

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:09.170
MAF, the ability to then
serve at that loan for them

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.210
while we collect the money and
we do the loan distributions.

00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:15.720
And then we also report that
activity to the credit bureaus.

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:18.810
And so right now we actually
report to the three main credit

00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:21.300
bureaus, Experian,
Equifax, and TransUnion.

00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.060
So that activity of
reporting to credit bureaus,

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:27.420
it actually is what helps
people start their credit score

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:29.760
or improve their credit
score just by virtue

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.510
of us reporting to them.

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:34.950
So we basically took this
activity that was informal--

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:35.910
but it was good, right?

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:37.950
Because it's people,
again, coming together

00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:40.590
to lend each other money,
to save money together

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.860
based on trust, based on each
other's relationship which

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:45.540
we thought was a good thing.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.990
And people are still doing
it in their communities.

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.780
So we took that practice
and formalized it in a way

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:55.950
that we can give this, sort of,
this financial benefit of being

00:23:55.950 --> 00:23:57.950
able to start to improve
their credit scores.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.830
And so we're going to give you
an example of the type of folks

00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:09.700
that we work with because,
again, this activity

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:14.570
alone is helping people
like Michael here.

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:19.212
Michael, he actually
is from Ethiopia.

00:24:19.212 --> 00:24:20.920
And he was actually
a doctor in Ethiopia,

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:23.740
but he came to this country
wanting to practice medicine.

00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.710
But he couldn't
because he didn't have

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.080
the right credentials here.

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:31.510
And like every other
immigrant, they

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.285
come here it's like trying to
what the credit system is here

00:24:35.285 --> 00:24:36.160
it's always baffling.

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.390
Right?

00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:38.540
It's like-- because people
know that they need credit

00:24:38.540 --> 00:24:39.140
to get credit.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.540
But if you don't have credit
you can't get credit, right?

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.870
So people get stuck in
this, sort of a catch-22.

00:24:44.870 --> 00:24:47.870
How many of you guys have
been stuck in a catch-22?

00:24:47.870 --> 00:24:48.660
I know, right?

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.750
It's real.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.190
It happens to people.

00:24:51.190 --> 00:24:53.020
And so then the
question is like, well,

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:54.280
how do you break in?

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.740
How do you break
into the system?

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.120
You need to have credit
in order to get credit.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:02.500
And so it's not only just
the issue for immigrants

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:03.640
of any type, right?

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:08.080
But also this is a critical
issue for young adults as well.

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:11.810
So Michael was it was
an example of that,

00:25:11.810 --> 00:25:14.320
that he struggled to break
into the credit system.

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:17.000
But he actually joined
a lending circle.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.600
And then so he basically
went from zero, not having--

00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.980
being credit invisible, to
getting a credit score of 672

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.040
by participating in
the lending circle.

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.510
And with that credit score,
with that credit history,

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.890
he was able to,
sort of, leverage

00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.020
that to continue
on in his studies

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:38.060
and to continue on with his
life here in the United States.

00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.990
And Michael is an example of--

00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:43.990
there's about 26-- this
is a report from the CFPV

00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.770
who found that there's about 26
million adults who are credit

00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:51.280
invisible just like Michael,
that again, they are maybe

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.990
immigrants, or
maybe young adults,

00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:57.130
but people that are completely
invisible to the credit system.

00:25:57.130 --> 00:26:02.400
But there's also other
people, like Alicia, who

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.090
is an entrepreneur by nature.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:08.500
She actually makes tamales.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.340
But she said she wanted
to start her business,

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.200
build her business,
but she knew that she

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.110
needed to have a good credit
score in order to leverage

00:26:17.110 --> 00:26:19.370
loans to make that happen.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.160
But when she came
to us she actually

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.050
had a pretty bad credit
score and even the level

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:28.750
of her business was
so small that even

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.740
the most good-hearted,
micro-lending,

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.750
nonprofit organization
would even give her a loan.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.320
Now I'm not talking about the
Bank of Americas or the Wells

00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:39.760
Fargos, these are the other
nonprofit organizations

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.010
that were already set up
to help people like her.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.750
So they wouldn't even
lend to her because

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:44.876
of her financial situation.

00:26:44.876 --> 00:26:47.166
I mean, just to kind of give
you an indication of where

00:26:47.166 --> 00:26:48.820
she was at at the
time, she would

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.210
buy supplies to make her
tamales on a weekly basis.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:53.310
And she was only--

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.740
I think she was only making
about 100 tamales per week

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.540
when she started with us.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.050
But she got her
first loan with MAF

00:27:01.050 --> 00:27:02.980
and then she started
building her credit.

00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:06.580
We have helped her manage
her budgets and to the point

00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.390
where in the past year she
actually grew her business

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:12.700
where she's now has
even seven employees

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:16.240
and making over $3,000
tamales on a weekly basis.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.910
And she actually has dreams
of increasing that number

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:22.650
in the years to come.

00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:25.206
But it's people
like her who had--

00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:26.740
could have had a
bad credit score

00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:29.700
for a lot of different reasons,
But through this program

00:27:29.700 --> 00:27:31.450
we were able to kind
of get her to a point

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:35.380
where she was able to get
loans from those micro-lending

00:27:35.380 --> 00:27:37.660
organizations and
leverage those resources

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:42.070
so that she can live out
her entrepreneurial dreams.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:46.390
And there's other people
like Leticia as well.

00:27:46.390 --> 00:27:49.030
Leticia is also an immigrant
who came to this country

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.630
as a young--

00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:52.990
actually she was 26 at the time.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.770
She was married.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:56.380
She lived-- a legal,
permanent resident.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:57.580
She had two children.

00:27:57.580 --> 00:27:58.810
She had a house.

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:01.840
She had a business
but then life happens.

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:03.980
It happens to any
one of us, right?

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:08.410
Where, in her case, her
marriage ended up in divorce.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.050
And her kids kind of
grew up and moved out

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:14.500
and then she had a couple
of foster kids to deal with.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.540
But she actually lost
some of those investments

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:19.120
because of just life
happened to her.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.460
And so she was in--
and it also was

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:24.880
compounded by that downturn
in the economy at that time.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.030
But she was in a
situation where--

00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.590
I remember when she came
to us she said, like, well,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:34.090
I'm already resigned to the idea
that I have to wait seven years

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:37.600
before I kind of re-make my
financial lives because--

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.790
we all hear that, you
have to wait seven years

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:42.992
before you can start improving
your credit score, right?

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:44.200
And so we say, you know what?

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.060
You actually don't have
to wait seven years.

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:50.140
You can actually start now to
actually improve your credit

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:53.500
history so that that way she can
kind of continue on and rebuild

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.730
our financial lives.

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.100
So her credit score,
when she started with us,

00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.812
it was at a very low at 324.

00:28:59.812 --> 00:29:02.270
That's because, again, she had
a lot of-- some foreclosures

00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.164
and it was really bad.

00:29:04.164 --> 00:29:05.080
But through the years.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:09.750
She was able to increase
that from 324 to 626

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.334
just by practising that.

00:29:11.334 --> 00:29:13.250
And she was able to kind
of get back and start

00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.332
in a new business as well.

00:29:15.332 --> 00:29:17.790
And so just to kind of give
you an indication of like how--

00:29:17.790 --> 00:29:21.060
by building on what is
good in people's lives

00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:23.160
and actually acknowledging
that and then building

00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.770
a program around it,
building an infrastructure

00:29:25.770 --> 00:29:27.570
to make that
actually work, we've

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:29.690
been able to sort of
help people like Michael,

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:32.310
like Alicia and
Leticia, and thousands

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:36.750
of others to actually build
and improve and realize

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:40.230
their financial potential.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:42.420
In terms of the
impact of our work,

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.950
we've managed over $6
million in lending circles.

00:29:45.950 --> 00:29:49.050
And I have to say that these
are all zero interest, zero fee

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.120
loans because it's,
against, this is money

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.680
that people are
lending themselves

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:56.610
and we essentially are just like
the servicers of those loans.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:30:00.300
And it's over-- now
it's about 6400 loans.

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:04.800
The repayment rate on
all these loans, 99.3%.

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.430
So our default rate is 0.7%.

00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:09.000
This is completely
unheard of, even

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.545
in the micro-lending
world, where

00:30:10.545 --> 00:30:16.020
in the average industry is
more like 12% to 14% default.

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:20.790
So this-- to get like a
0.7% is really remarkable.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.890
On average, you will see
people's credit scores

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:27.180
increased by 160 points and
then with an average final score

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:28.500
of 659.

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:31.150
And that's, again,
it's a credit square

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:36.280
where now they can actually
start engaging lenders

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.970
in the micro market price.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:41.160
And so we've seen significant
impacts in people's lives

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:44.930
over the past seven years.

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.200
And so how we did
this work, of course,

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:50.130
was by investing in technology.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:55.080
We built a whole apparatus,
the lending circles platform,

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.420
to help us manage
these very complicated

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:03.330
financial transactions because
when we started our work

00:31:03.330 --> 00:31:06.150
we couldn't go to Best
Buy and just take off--

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:12.330
pick up some software to
manage lending circle loans.

00:31:12.330 --> 00:31:14.500
I mean, there wasn't
such a thing created.

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.860
So we actually had to
create it ourselves.

00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:19.860
So we build our
platform on Salesforce.

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:21.630
And so that itself,
kind of gave us

00:31:21.630 --> 00:31:23.990
the ability to
expand and increase

00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.730
our work beyond San Francisco.

00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:28.050
And then we actually even have--

00:31:28.050 --> 00:31:29.670
we started with a
mobile friendly,

00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:31.710
but now we're actually
creating a lending circle

00:31:31.710 --> 00:31:33.870
app itself-- a native
app, so that way

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:37.990
we can help our clients manage
their money in that way.

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.810
And we've also--
and again, we do

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:41.550
a lot of financial education.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:44.070
We provide a lot of tutorials.

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.830
They deal is we partner
with a group called EverFi

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.220
and we use a lot of
their videos to provide

00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:54.600
financial insights on how to
navigate the financial system.

00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:58.320
What we saw is that financial
education alone by itself

00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.530
is really irrelevant.

00:31:59.530 --> 00:32:00.610
It doesn't really work.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:03.120
But when you actually tie it
to a financial product where

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:06.900
people actually learn something
from the activity itself,

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.290
we actually saw that people
were able to improve their score

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:13.530
by an additional 27 points
than if people were just

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:15.540
doing the financial
product by itself.

00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.190
So that that number
itself kind of

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.410
made me a believer that
financial education,

00:32:19.410 --> 00:32:22.320
when his properly presented
to people in a way that

00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.650
is easy to use and
manageable, it actually

00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.830
had a significant
impact on their lives.

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.720
And we're also
expanding our work

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.060
by way of franchising
the model with

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.810
other nonprofit organizations.

00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:37.980
We're actually engaging
other organizations,

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.230
other nonprofits,
so that way they

00:32:40.230 --> 00:32:42.720
can deliver lending circles
to their own communities

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.940
and then we manage all
of the technology--

00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:46.920
all of the operations--
on the back end.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.640
So that way we can
expand by having just one

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.477
office in San Francisco
but the technology

00:32:53.477 --> 00:32:54.810
we're definitely expanding that.

00:32:54.810 --> 00:32:57.030
So right now we have
about 52 providers

00:32:57.030 --> 00:33:02.390
in 17 different states plus
the District of Columbia.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.510
And so on the final
slide I want to,

00:33:04.510 --> 00:33:07.830
again, reiterate the key
takeaways from our work.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:09.750
And this is something
that I definitely

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:14.730
wanted to come back to it, which
is in addressing poverty alone,

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.760
it is a difficult
issue, but we have

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.990
to think about it
in a different way

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.940
so that where we can actually
provide significant impact

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:24.776
in people's lives.

00:33:24.776 --> 00:33:27.150
In the way that we've been
thinking about it in the past,

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:31.410
I feel that that is not
working and people are actually

00:33:31.410 --> 00:33:33.090
getting stuck there even more.

00:33:33.090 --> 00:33:35.400
And so we also need
to find solutions

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.180
that are grounded in people's
lives not in what do we--

00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:41.520
on the assumptions that
we have of their lives

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.620
or whatever alternative
facts we may

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.770
have of people in
their struggles,

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:49.800
but in the actual
lived experiences.

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:54.710
And in through that our hope
is that America's beacon

00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:57.060
will shine once
again when we truly

00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:59.550
can remove all those
barriers and pitfalls

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:02.620
and actually allow people
to realize their full human

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:04.189
and financial potential.

00:34:04.189 --> 00:34:06.480
And so that, if anything--
if you can remember anything

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.989
please remember those two
things, that poverty is hard.

00:34:09.989 --> 00:34:11.139
It's not an easy thing.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.040
It's not something
you can just wish away

00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.620
but we actually do have to
engage in people's lives

00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.460
and really bring about some
significant benefit to who they

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:21.239
are.

00:34:21.239 --> 00:34:26.150
So I'll stop there and take
any questions or just to-- oh,

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:30.464
yes-- to make sure that for all
of you Googlers out in YouTube

00:34:30.464 --> 00:34:31.139
land--

00:34:31.139 --> 00:34:33.660
yeah, I can say that--

00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:36.080
definitely love for you
guys to engage with us

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:39.210
through everyday heroes.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:43.380
This really is a time to be
generous with your resources,

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.610
with your talent.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:48.060
Based on what we've seen
in the past two weeks,

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.449
we're going to be in a fight
for the next four years.

00:34:52.449 --> 00:34:54.900
And this is really where
we need all hands on deck

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.230
to actually make an impact
and support and defend

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:01.860
what we hold true, not just
for immigrants, but really

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:04.080
for America as it is.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:07.020
So be generous with
your time and resources.

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:08.460
Engage with us.

00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:12.840
Join us and then we'll figure
out a way to make common cause.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.940
And I'll leave you with
my contact information.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.090
You can always email me,
or call, or visit, or us

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.510
or tweet us and so that
way we can find a way

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.126
to converse with you.

00:35:24.126 --> 00:35:25.500
So I'll end there,
but if there's

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.200
any questions or any comments--

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:30.847
AUDIENCE: So how can you
keep the default rate so low?

00:35:30.847 --> 00:35:32.430
SPEAKER: Yes, that's
a great question.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:36.097
I know-- people
always ask us that.

00:35:36.097 --> 00:35:37.680
And I think it's
because of this, it's

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.720
that we start our work
by showing them respect.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.420
We start the conversations
by saying, look,

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.790
we're here to help.

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:49.080
These are zero interest,
zero fee loans.

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.850
This is their money, right?

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:52.410
And then we also
require for people

00:35:52.410 --> 00:35:56.550
to come together in a group and
see each other face-to-face so

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:59.130
that they know who is
in that lending circle

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:01.059
and they have a common
relationship there.

00:36:01.059 --> 00:36:03.600
Now, they may not necessarily
be each others friends, or best

00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.490
friends, or neighbors, they
may be total strangers.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.760
But because they're-- we're sort
of managing it as a nonprofit

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.750
and we're giving them the
benefit of reporting it,

00:36:12.750 --> 00:36:14.695
people follow through
with their commitment.

00:36:14.695 --> 00:36:17.070
And so-- and we also tell
them, it's like, you know what?

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:19.110
If there's a default,
we take the hit.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.190
MAF takes a hit, right?

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:22.380
And so there's a commitment
that we show them.

00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:25.170
And I think that commitment
to that they show us in return

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.000
and they pay us back.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.680
I mean, that's one
level of answering.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.950
Another thing is, too, our
technology makes it really easy

00:36:31.950 --> 00:36:33.330
for them to participate.

00:36:33.330 --> 00:36:35.910
We don't require
them to send a check

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:38.161
or we don't say you have to
come here before 5 o'clock

00:36:38.161 --> 00:36:40.826
on Friday or else we're going to
close the door and that's that.

00:36:40.826 --> 00:36:41.800
So we make it easier.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.395
So we're, in a sense,
we're leveraging technology

00:36:44.395 --> 00:36:46.770
just like in the way that you
want to leverage technology

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:49.320
to make your financial
transactions easy.

00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.690
We're giving them the
same power of technology

00:36:51.690 --> 00:36:53.730
to make their their
financial lives easy

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:58.620
so they can actually, then,
pay us in an easy way.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.960
AUDIENCE: So if the
lender and the borrower

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.900
don't necessarily know each
other before they come to you,

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:07.620
what is the primary
incentive for the people

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:11.070
to front the money
to participate?

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.620
JOSE QUINONEZ: Yeah, so we've
asked that question to folks

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:18.510
because if you get the lending
circle distribution at the end,

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:21.600
you're essentially putting in
$100 every month and at the end

00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.669
you get the $1000.

00:37:22.669 --> 00:37:24.210
So essentially you're
kind of saving.

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:27.270
So some people do it because of
that because they want to save.

00:37:27.270 --> 00:37:30.730
They want that sort of
social commitment to save.

00:37:30.730 --> 00:37:33.180
They want to make that social--

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:38.150
or out-- they want
to make that--

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:42.150
be forced to do that like
a compulsory savings habit,

00:37:42.150 --> 00:37:42.810
if you will.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:46.020
So some people
have that benefit.

00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:49.410
But other people, they know that
by them putting in their money

00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:51.750
at play, that the others
will get their money

00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.940
and then be able to sort
of pay down high cost debt.

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:55.549
So they're helping other people.

00:37:55.549 --> 00:37:57.840
And that's something, again,
that is actually important

00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.520
because when we think
about poor people,

00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:03.060
we don't think about them as
having the potential for them

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.390
to helping each other.

00:38:04.390 --> 00:38:06.420
But in this case, we
actually see that where

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.520
there like some people
want the other person

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.110
to be the first
to take that $1000

00:38:10.110 --> 00:38:13.260
loan so that they can
deal with their issues.

00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:17.142
And so I feel good,
they feel good.

00:38:17.142 --> 00:38:19.350
They feel good because
they're helping their neighbor

00:38:19.350 --> 00:38:22.394
and helping other people
manage their lives.

00:38:22.394 --> 00:38:26.340
So their incentive is not
necessarily just monetary

00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:28.490
because they get no benefit.

00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:30.660
We're not giving
them a dividend.

00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:32.520
We're not giving them
an interest payment.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.850
They're going to get
$1,000 at the end, right?

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.240
But I think it's like they
like the social component of it

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:40.670
just as well.

00:38:40.670 --> 00:38:43.170
AUDIENCE: The lenders,
are they people

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:45.390
from the same social
circles as the borrowers?

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:46.181
JOSE QUINONEZ: Yes.

00:38:46.181 --> 00:38:48.480
So imagine that 10 people
in the lending circle

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.210
are both the lenders
and the borrowers.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:53.900
So imagine, if you're the
first person to get the $1,000,

00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:57.270
you're the borrower and the
nine people are lenders.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.070
And then if you're
the second person,

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:02.730
you then transform yourself
from a lender to a borrower.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.880
And then the other eight
people are lenders--

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.040
they're lenders, right?

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:09.900
And so when you get that
lump sum distribution you

00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:13.110
transform yourself
into the lender.

00:39:13.110 --> 00:39:17.550
So they're both the lenders
and borrowers at the same time.

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:20.610
And so it's kind of hard to
imagine because traditionally

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:24.150
we think about the
external resource that

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:27.330
comes in-- a bank is money
and then we pay them back.

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.190
And that's the only
relationship they have.

00:39:29.190 --> 00:39:32.580
But here, it's like we manage
to do it in the traditional way.

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:34.600
Like this actually--
this is how they do it.

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.800
And by us formalizing
it, we were

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:40.020
able to give people the
benefit of reporting it

00:39:40.020 --> 00:39:41.499
to the credit bureaus.

00:39:41.499 --> 00:39:43.290
AUDIENCE: Could you
speak a little bit more

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.870
about your expansion across
the country in collaboration

00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:47.326
with other nonprofits?

00:39:47.326 --> 00:39:49.200
I'm just curious how
you're working with them

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.607
and what their role is in the--

00:39:50.607 --> 00:39:51.440
JOSE QUINONEZ: Yeah.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.630
Thank you for that.

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:55.380
So one of the things
that in nonprofit sector

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.680
we do a lot is we talk
a lot about cooperation.

00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:00.720
We talk about doing
things together

00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:02.940
because it's just
our nonprofit speak.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:04.750
You guys have your
own Google speak,

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:06.900
we have our own nonprofit speak.

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.790
But in reality, it's
actually very hard

00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.490
to work with other
nonprofits in coalition.

00:40:11.490 --> 00:40:14.790
Particularly when we talk
about products and services

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.480
because as a
nonprofit that product

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.160
is our intellectual
property, right?

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.370
And so when you actually
kind of give it away

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:26.370
it sort of diminishes
people's ability to actually

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:28.082
fundraise or support that.

00:40:28.082 --> 00:40:29.790
So we talk a lot about
it but it actually

00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.320
never happens in a great deal.

00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:35.190
So how we found
a way to do that,

00:40:35.190 --> 00:40:37.620
however, we found a
way to essentially kind

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:39.060
of franchise the product.

00:40:39.060 --> 00:40:42.300
We franchise our
program when we engage

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:45.180
nonprofit organizations that
want to implement the program.

00:40:45.180 --> 00:40:47.260
And then we have a
contract with them

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.470
to say we're going to give you
the program as a franchise,

00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:54.150
and then we're going to give
you the TA, the training

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.030
and technical assistance
for them to implement it.

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.030
But it is still our product.

00:40:59.030 --> 00:41:02.820
So that way we can still keep
quality control over it, right?

00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.740
And so that we can
engage with them.

00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.810
And then they, in
turn, pay us a fee.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:08.764
They pay us a license
fee for managing that.

00:41:08.764 --> 00:41:11.430
But then what they get in return
is that they have-- now there's

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:14.340
a phenomenal innovative
product where they can actually

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:15.270
fundraise around it.

00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.580
So that they can
support their staff time

00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:21.340
and their operation-- which is
exactly what needs to happen.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:27.380
And so, in a sense, by us giving
it away as a franchise product,

00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.010
we were able to
sort of replicate it

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:32.430
without us going to those
cities and starting nonprofit--

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:35.940
I mean, [INAUDIBLE]
as an office, right?

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.541
Because for us, that's actually
it's a cost prohibitive path

00:41:39.541 --> 00:41:41.040
because there's no
resources that we

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:44.700
can tap to open 50 offices
across the country,

00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:46.450
much less even 10 or two.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.360
I mean, it's just
hard for nonprofits

00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:51.210
because we don't have
access to venture capital

00:41:51.210 --> 00:41:54.570
or the sort of resources
that could help us with that.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.540
So here, we basically took
a page from our clients

00:41:57.540 --> 00:41:59.790
actually-- which is partner.

00:41:59.790 --> 00:42:00.960
Work with each other.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:01.710
Trust each other.

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:06.480
Have a relationship with each
other that is that there is

00:42:06.480 --> 00:42:08.100
mutual in effect, right?

00:42:08.100 --> 00:42:10.360
So in that sense
it's working well.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.260
Now, the work,
however, is about you

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.000
have to continually trained.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.734
There's a lot of the
technology that we

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.900
have had to build to make
sure that they're actually

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.706
using that technology properly.

00:42:21.706 --> 00:42:23.580
And we have to retrain
and retrain constantly

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:28.210
so that the staff can implement
the program correctly.

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:31.410
But that really was the only
way for us to scale on the way

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:32.879
that we have scaled.

00:42:32.879 --> 00:42:34.920
I sort of say that and I
started at the beginning

00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.295
by saying that
like in nonprofits

00:42:36.295 --> 00:42:39.060
we talk a lot about cooperation
but it doesn't happen a lot,

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:41.550
it's because it's
just hard to do.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:45.210
And so there's not a lot of
examples of-- in the nonprofit

00:42:45.210 --> 00:42:46.100
field--

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.380
of others that have franchised
their programs in the way

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.910
that we have.

00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:53.640
And I think that's just one of
the sad realities of our field.

00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:54.431
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:42:54.431 --> 00:42:55.830
Good questions.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:59.010
I have a question now that
I don't know the answer to.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:02.939
Does the Mission Asset Fund
except direct donations?

00:43:02.939 --> 00:43:04.480
JOSE QUINONEZ: No
we did not accept--

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:08.100
[LAUGHS] yes, we do
accept direct donations.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.460
So if you, again,
can give generously--

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:14.070
I know you have
a lot of talents.

00:43:14.070 --> 00:43:18.570
A lot of your expertise can
also be a great benefit to us.

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:21.480
We have a lot of
ideas but we really

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.520
are poor in time and
resources and talent.

00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.680
So if you guys want to sort
of help with that regard,

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.440
we know we can, again,
tinker and innovate

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:34.150
to make something happen.

00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:36.220
So thank you so much
for the opportunity

00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:40.050
to come to the Google
campus and share our story.

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:42.420
I think there's something
that is real there

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.630
and we definitely are trying
to share with the world.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:49.750
And in times like this we have
to sort of tell our stories,

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.980
as an immigrant, about what
we're doing on the edges

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:56.080
because this is really
what makes America great.

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.657
And we want to sort
of protect that.

00:43:57.657 --> 00:43:58.990
And we will need to defend that.

00:43:58.990 --> 00:44:02.370
And not allow somebody
else to tell us otherwise

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.980
because I do not believe
that the current president is

00:44:04.980 --> 00:44:07.260
going to write the last
chapter in America.

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:10.170
He does not have that
authority no that right.

00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:10.890
We will.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:14.230
But we have to continue working
together to make that happen.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:16.489
So again, thank you
so much for your time.

00:44:16.489 --> 00:44:17.280
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:20.330
