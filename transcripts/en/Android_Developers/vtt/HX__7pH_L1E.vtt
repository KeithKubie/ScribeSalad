GAVIN BARRETT: The launch of the
family section on Google Play

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.370
was hugely positive
for StoryToys.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.555
I think what it did
was solve the discovery

00:00:11.555 --> 00:00:13.980
issue for parents.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.610
EMMET O'NEILL: It's really
provided a safe, trusted,

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.399
creative space for families
to find new content.

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:23.940
SHARON RECHTER: My partner Guy
Oranim and I started BabyFirst

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.410
with the idea and the passion to
create good educational content

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.250
for babies, toddlers,
and their parents.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.680
When we learned about
the family category

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.970
on the Google Play Store,
it was a 100% match

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.310
to the BabyFirst values.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.160
We have seen that
parents can easily

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.900
find the content
they are looking for.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.490
We now have 40% more
downloads on Google Play

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.580
than we do on other platforms.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.686
We like that.

00:00:48.686 --> 00:00:51.310
GAVIN BARRETT: Since the launch
of the family section on Google

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.010
Play, our experience
with Android

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.710
has been completely transformed.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.600
We saw a huge
uplift in revenues,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.782
and our downloads to
Google Play was now

00:00:58.782 --> 00:01:01.240
our number one [? chart. ?]
It's been nothing but positive,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.780
and we're delighted
to be involved.
