00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:16.310 align:start position:0%
in this movie I think the kids are
 

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
in this movie I think the kids are
pretty<00:08:16.460><c> miscast</c><00:08:16.940><c> I</c><00:08:17.360><c> think</c><00:08:17.930><c> that</c><00:08:18.400><c> maybe</c><00:08:19.400><c> that's</c>

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:19.610 align:start position:0%
pretty miscast I think that maybe that's
 

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:20.110 align:start position:0%
pretty miscast I think that maybe that's

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
not true
 

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.550 align:start position:0%
not true
because<00:08:20.360><c> I</c><00:08:20.450><c> think</c><00:08:20.510><c> that</c><00:08:20.840><c> the</c><00:08:20.960><c> adults</c><00:08:21.410><c> that</c><00:08:21.470><c> I</c>

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
because I think that the adults that I
 

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.530 align:start position:0%
because I think that the adults that I
really<00:08:21.800><c> enjoyed</c><00:08:22.340><c> I</c><00:08:22.370><c> wanted</c><00:08:23.000><c> more</c><00:08:23.210><c> from</c><00:08:23.330><c> them</c>

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:24.530 align:start position:0%
so why would I
 

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:26.470 align:start position:0%
so why would I
I<00:08:24.560><c> just</c><00:08:25.310><c> don't</c><00:08:25.430><c> know</c><00:08:25.580><c> who</c><00:08:25.760><c> the</c><00:08:25.880><c> kids</c><00:08:26.060><c> are</c><00:08:26.210><c> so</c>

I just don't know who the kids are so
 

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.180 align:start position:0%
I just don't know who the kids are so
maybe<00:08:26.690><c> that's</c><00:08:26.960><c> why</c><00:08:27.080><c> I'm</c><00:08:27.200><c> saying</c><00:08:27.380><c> that</c><00:08:27.530><c> I</c><00:08:27.770><c> think</c>

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:28.190 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why I'm saying that I think
 

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
maybe that's why I'm saying that I think
I<00:08:28.310><c> don't</c><00:08:28.430><c> know</c><00:08:28.640><c> the</c><00:08:28.850><c> actors</c><00:08:29.780><c> were</c><00:08:29.960><c> not</c><00:08:30.140><c> it</c><00:08:30.410><c> was</c>
