00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.110
That previous video, was really long.

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.610
Before we continue, I want to share with you this one question a lot of

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.130
students ask me, when I teach them programming, and that question is,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.180
how did I learn all of this stuff?

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.280
Well, the true answer is, I searched for and read documentation.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.870
I Googled for how to create an action, in Xcode.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.090
And here, I landed on a help page created by Apple.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.730
This page demonstrated how to make a connection between a button, and code.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.100
So it is in this spirit of figuring out new things while reading documentation,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.970
I want to present a couple of challenges to you,

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.540
that you can help find the answers for.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.040
Your first question.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.380
What does this tiny circle do?

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.910
You can find the circle.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.520
Right next to the action, in the gutter.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.000
And your second question, is what does this tiny icon do?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.320
This icon is called Connections Inspector.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.770
And you can find it in the Utility area.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.860
You can enter your responses, in these boxes.
