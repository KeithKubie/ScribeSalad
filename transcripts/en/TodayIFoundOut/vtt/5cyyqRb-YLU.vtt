00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:20.070
“Blonde bombshell” is often used to describe
an exciting, dynamic, sexy woman with blonde

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.099
hair, particularly blonde celebrity sex symbols.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:28.300
The expression seems to have come from, or
at least was popularized by, a movie and originally

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.029
referred to a specific blonde bombshell.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.480
In 1933, the platinum blonde Jean Harlow was
one of the most popular actresses in Hollywood.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.550
That year, Harlow starred in a movie called
Bombshell (at the time “bombshell” in

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.329
American slang was already being used to refer
to incredibly attractive, flamboyant women,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.269
with the first documented case of this in
1860).

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:56.280
One of the advertising lines for the film
was ==

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.990
When the film was released in England, they
even renamed it “Blonde Bombshell” as

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.350
it was thought in England that the original
title sounded like a war film, which the movie

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.830
is decidedly not.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.800
(It’s actually about an actress who gets
fed up with being a sex symbol and just wants

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.430
to lead a normal life).

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.860
While it seems probable that this wasn’t
the first time someone out there uttered the

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.300
words “blonde bombshell” (those two words
fitting together so nicely), this does appear

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.680
to be the first documented instance of it
with, of course, the first actress to be labeled

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.080
such being the lovely Jean Harlow.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.500
Within a decade, “blonde bombshell” was
being bandied about referring to several different

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.110
famous women and, of course, today has spread
to mean any particularly attractive blonde

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.600
woman (and in a few instances, such as Charles
Borck, men).

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.440
Bonus Jean Harlow Facts:
• Both beautiful blonde bombshells Jean

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.680
Harlow and Marilyn Monroe did their last movies
with Clark Gable as a co-star (Saratoga for

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.460
Harlow and The Misfits for Monroe).

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.750
• Harlow was not just partially responsible
for the “Blonde Bombshell” moniker, but

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.790
also propelled the platinum blonde craze that
swept the nation.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.480
Howard Hughes even set up Platinum Blonde
Clubs and at one point offered $10,000 (about

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:09.920
$123K today) to anyone who could come up with
a hair dye that exactly matched Harlow’s

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.180
supposedly natural “platinum blonde” hair
color.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.610
• Jean Harlow’s real name was Harlean
Carpenter.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.650
“Jean Harlow” was actually her mother’s
name (Jean Poe Harlow), which she decided

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.040
to use as her stage name.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.829
• Harlow’s mother and father did not get
along, the marriage having been arranged despite

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.609
the objections of the bride.

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.030
The couple finally divorced in 1922 and Harlow’s
mother attempted to become an actress, but

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.659
was considered too old at 34 and was forced
to move back to Kansas in order for Harlow’s

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:41.640
wealthy grandfather to continue to support
them.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.599
This was a major event in Jean Harlow’s
life as when she returned to Kansas with her

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.209
mother, her grandfather sent her to Camp Cha-Ton-Ka
where she contracted scarlet fever.

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.910
Obviously she didn’t die of this, so why
is this such a momentous occasion in her life?

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.450
Because many speculate that it was her bout
with scarlet fever that ultimately caused

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.159
the problem that would result in her death
at 26 on June 7, 1937.

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.639
Specifically, her death was probably due to
kidney failure, resulting in “uremic poisoning”

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.370
(the buildup of various toxins in the blood
causing a variety of complications).

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.170
She also gained significant water weight during
this time as you might expect from kidney

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.170
failure.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.749
The official cause of death recorded at the
time was “cerebral edema” (basically,

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:22.359
excess water in the brain).

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.240
For about a month Harlow’s illness was misdiagnosed
as the flu then a gall bladder infection,

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.370
even though she’d been showing signs of
the real problem for over a year.

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.481
It wasn’t until on June 6, the day before
her death, that she checked back into the

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.730
hospital after having vision problems that
the doctor realized that her illness was something

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.419
more severe.

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:45.529
• Harlow’s mother was a Christian Scientist
(who most members of don’t believe in receiving

00:03:45.529 --> 00:03:50.310
medical care, but rather relying on healing
via highly structured prayer from “practitioners”

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.239
and an individual believing what is wrong
with them is simply an illusion of “mortal

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.239
mind”).

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.389
Because of this, after Harlow’s death a
myth rose up that Harlow only died because

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.159
her mother refused to allow her to be treated
by doctors.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.400
This isn’t the case at all.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.980
Her mother only refused one doctor access
to Harlow, MGM’s doctor who later claimed

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.060
that Harlow’s mother refused to allow doctors
to see her due to her religious beliefs.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.709
Other doctors were allowed to treat the ailing
Harlow.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.010
• Unfortunately for Harlow, medical science
had not yet advanced enough to be able to

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.590
do anything about her condition at the time,
even had she been correctly diagnosed.

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.580
The first successful kidney transplant didn’t
occur until 1954, and, even then, the lack

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.210
of a good method to suppress a patient’s
immune system so that their body wouldn’t

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.690
reject the transplanted organ was extremely
problematic.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.510
Initial efforts towards this end included
bombarding patients with large amounts of

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:45.960
X-ray radiation, which was partially successful,
but also tended to have the side effect of

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.960
killing the patient.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.390
It wasn’t until around another decade that
tissue typing and immunosuppressent drugs

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.880
started to be developed and used so that successful
transplants started to become somewhat common.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.060
Even then, it wasn’t until around the 1980s
when the kidney transplant success rate started

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.160
to be extremely high (about an 85% success
rate in the 1980s).

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.530
• Harlow got married at the age of 16 to
20 year old Charles McGrew, who received a

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.790
large inheritance when he turned 21.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.480
This allowed the couple to move to Beverly
Hills, where seemingly boredom (neither of

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.190
the couple worked) and Harlow’s friend,
aspiring actress Rosalie Roy, helped inspire

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.680
her to get into acting, first taking roles
as an extra, and progressively landing larger

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.880
roles until her big break when she stared
in Howard Hughe’s Hell’s Angels, which

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.790
debuted about a year after Harlow divorced
her husband in 1929.

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.560
• Harlow’s second husband, Paul Bern,
killed himself by shooting himself in the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.100
head just two months after marrying Harlow.

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.830
At the time, there was significant speculation
that Harlow had actually murdered him, but

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.240
an apparent suicide note in Bern’s handwriting
was found stating: “Dearest Dear, Unfortunately

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.180
this is the only way to make good the frightful
wrong I have done you and to wipe out my abject

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.140
humiliation, I Love you.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:00.140
Paul…

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.290
You understand that last night was only a
comedy.”

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.160
It was also speculated that Bern may have
been murdered by his estranged and supposedly

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.910
mentally ill common law wife, Dorothy Millette
(who he had supported through her mental illness

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:16.550
before she was released a couple years before
Bern’s death and pronounced mentally fit).

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.850
He continued to support her after her release
and visited her on occasion apparently remaining

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.010
on friendly terms.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.620
Millette was also found dead just a couple
days after Bern, apparently from suicide (found

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:30.700
drowned after taking a trip on the Delta King
steam boat and supposedly jumping off, but

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.650
there were no witnesses.)

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.470
Depending on which conspiracy theorist is
talking, this either proves that she killed

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:41.520
Bern (killing herself out of guilt) or proves
that Harlow did it or had it done (perhaps

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.670
using her connections with her former lover
and notorious mobster Abner Zwillman).

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.710
Or, you know, Bern might have really just
killed himself as all the evidence points

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:55.460
to and the somewhat already mentally unstable
Millette may have fallen into a deep depression

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.050
upon hearing about Bern’s death and killed
herself over it.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.740
• Jean Harlow was the godmother of mobster
Benjamin Bugsy Siegel’s daughter, Millicent

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:06.740
Siegel.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.790
• Harlow’s third marriage was arranged
by MGM in order to avoid a scandal.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.130
Shortly after Bern’s death, Harlow began
having an affair with famed boxer Max Baer,

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.930
who was married at the time, though already
separated from his wife.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.830
When Baer’s wife finally officially filed
for divorce, she listed Harlow as one of the

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.860
reasons (because of the affair).

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.270
MGM hoped that by having Harlow marry Harold
Rosson, this would help quell the scandal

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.850
occurring so soon after the previous scandal
of Bern’s suicide.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:37.430
It worked and once the media storm died down
about a half a year later, Rosson and Harlow

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:51.910
ended their arranged marriage.
