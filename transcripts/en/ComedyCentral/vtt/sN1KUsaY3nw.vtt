00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:04.739
(typing)

00:00:04.739 --> 00:00:05.572
- Hey!

00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:08.983
Okay, so I got two different types of tile

00:00:08.983 --> 00:00:13.251
that we can choose from,
and I think this one's nice.

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:14.905
It's a little bit more simple.

00:00:14.905 --> 00:00:16.653
And then this--

00:00:16.653 --> 00:00:18.362
- No, I told you, you do the tiles.

00:00:18.362 --> 00:00:19.582
I don't care.

00:00:19.582 --> 00:00:22.131
I don't have an opinion and
I have to get this pitch done

00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:23.620
for Adventure Baby.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.150
I don't even know what I'm doing.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.433
- Okay.
- Okay?

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.317
- Please, please, please, please.

00:00:27.317 --> 00:00:28.276
Take this.

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:29.537
Take this away.

00:00:29.537 --> 00:00:30.688
- Alright, I'll figure it out.

00:00:30.688 --> 00:00:31.688
- Thank you.

00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.312
- I'm sorry.

00:00:34.312 --> 00:00:35.454
(keyboard clacking)

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:36.287
Jason?

00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:37.912
- What?

00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.785
- Have you been using my iPad?

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:41.364
- Your iPad?

00:00:41.364 --> 00:00:42.462
- Oh, no.

00:00:42.462 --> 00:00:44.479
You've been going to porn sites.

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.015
- No, no I haven't.

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:49.835
- Do not masturbate with my iPad, Jason.

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:51.026
And you're busy.

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:52.614
Oh, yeah, you're so busy.

00:00:52.614 --> 00:00:54.450
You're busy masturbating with my iPad.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:55.812
That's how busy you are.

00:00:55.812 --> 00:00:57.201
- The internet is so fast on there.

00:00:57.201 --> 00:00:58.215
I'm sorry.

00:00:58.215 --> 00:01:01.823
- Jason, why are you
masturbating anyway, huh?

00:01:01.823 --> 00:01:04.895
Hello, I'm open for business.

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:05.852
- Yeah.

00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:07.075
- And you look great. I just...

00:01:07.075 --> 00:01:09.709
You know, we've been getting
along so well lately.

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:11.502
I don't want to ruin the friendship.

00:01:11.502 --> 00:01:13.156
(cymbal tapping)

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:14.236
- Hey.

00:01:14.236 --> 00:01:15.411
- (Woman) Hey there.

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:18.604
- Oooo! Whoa! Whoa, look at that.

00:01:18.604 --> 00:01:22.771
Lookin' good. That's the
old...that's the old nighty.

00:01:23.845 --> 00:01:25.719
That's the little action nighty.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.552
- (Woman) Yes.

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:27.385
- Yep.

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:28.817
- We can do it tonight.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:30.813
- You know what? I really, I really...

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:33.230
I would love to, it's just...

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.704
Can I be honest?

00:01:35.704 --> 00:01:37.204
- Of course. What?

00:01:38.694 --> 00:01:40.453
- You won't tell anyone?

00:01:40.453 --> 00:01:41.853
- Who am I gonna tell?

00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:43.561
- Okay. I've just been like...

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:46.705
I'm really bumming out
about my penis lately.

00:01:46.705 --> 00:01:47.579
- What?

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.644
- It's really small.

00:01:48.644 --> 00:01:50.568
- No it's not. It really isn't.

00:01:50.568 --> 00:01:53.102
- No it's...it's...
- It's fine.

00:01:53.102 --> 00:01:54.902
- I stand in the mirror and
I'm like, what's going on?

00:01:54.902 --> 00:01:56.515
It's so small.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:01:58.469
It's just not...and it's not fun.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.163
It's not fun for me having a small penis.

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.942
It's like, it's like
having someone in your band

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:04.244
that isn't good.

00:02:04.244 --> 00:02:06.207
You know? It's like...

00:02:06.207 --> 00:02:08.643
It just ruins all of it.

00:02:08.643 --> 00:02:10.705
- Have you been watching too much porn?

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:13.049
- I have been watching a lot of porn.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.510
- How much would you say
you've been masterbating?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.750
- Like three or four everyday.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.053
Is that a lot?

00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:21.657
- Yeah.

00:02:21.657 --> 00:02:23.082
- Yeah. That is a lot.

00:02:23.082 --> 00:02:24.490
- That's a lot.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.561
- Well hey, got no problem in that area.

00:02:27.561 --> 00:02:30.033
Lot of guys have problems.

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:31.501
Not me.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:32.986
- Dad! It's me.

00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.112
Hello!

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.216
Jason can you come in here please?

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:37.904
I don't under...
- (Jason) What?!

00:02:37.904 --> 00:02:39.124
- Can you come in here
and help with the...?

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:40.763
I don't under...
- (Jason) The what?

00:02:40.763 --> 00:02:41.976
- With the Facetime on the I...

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:43.212
I don't understand if it's work...

00:02:43.212 --> 00:02:44.573
Dad, hi!

00:02:44.573 --> 00:02:46.207
- I can hear you but I can't see you.

00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.380
Where are you?

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.062
- (Jason) Hold on.

00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:49.895
- Okay look for the camera guys.

00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:50.994
- Hold on.

00:02:50.994 --> 00:02:52.420
- I see...hi.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.253
- Hi.

00:02:53.253 --> 00:02:54.108
- I see you. That...

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:55.394
- Is that you live?

00:02:55.394 --> 00:02:57.224
I mean it's not a video?

00:02:57.224 --> 00:02:58.745
This is really you now, live?

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:00.934
- Yes! You're talking to me right now.

00:03:00.934 --> 00:03:01.829
What kind of ques...

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:02.697
What are you...

00:03:02.697 --> 00:03:03.668
Can you hear me?

00:03:03.668 --> 00:03:05.583
- You know, we went to a party today

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:06.623
and we really had a great time.

00:03:06.623 --> 00:03:08.814
- Jason we thought about you.

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.734
There was a clown. He was fabulous

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.123
but you would have been better.

00:03:13.123 --> 00:03:14.621
- Yeah, you know, maybe Jason

00:03:14.621 --> 00:03:16.104
you should think about doing some clowning

00:03:16.104 --> 00:03:17.335
at some parties for kids.

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:19.666
You know, you've given
this comedy thing a shot

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.303
but let's get real, it's not...

00:03:21.303 --> 00:03:22.970
I don't think it's really
working out for you.

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.826
Maybe you should try clowning.
- I, I don't want

00:03:24.826 --> 00:03:26.361
to be a party clown Joe.
- No he's...

00:03:26.361 --> 00:03:27.845
I don't want to be.
- Stop, stop, stop.

00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:29.399
That's not what I want
to do with my life. So...

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:30.863
- Just stop. Just stop.

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:33.194
Dad he's not gonna be a clown alright?

00:03:33.194 --> 00:03:35.464
Just enough with the clown?

00:03:35.464 --> 00:03:36.426
- I'm not a clown.

00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.820
- He doesn't...he doesn't even know how

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.813
to make the balloon animals.

00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:39.788
There's like...

00:03:39.788 --> 00:03:40.641
No, he's not a clown.

00:03:40.641 --> 00:03:41.776
- It's not the same thing.

00:03:41.776 --> 00:03:43.200
A stand up is not the
same thing as a clown.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.688
I know that you think that it is.

00:03:44.688 --> 00:03:46.288
- Wait, just stop. J,
J. Just stop, just stop.

00:03:46.288 --> 00:03:47.942
- Are you sure this is you live?

00:03:47.942 --> 00:03:49.863
We're talking live?

00:03:49.863 --> 00:03:50.696
Real time?

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:54.214
(jazz music)

00:03:56.958 --> 00:03:58.237
- (Jason) Oh my god.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:03:59.726
Okay. Okay here we go.

00:03:59.726 --> 00:04:00.842
You ready?

00:04:00.842 --> 00:04:01.694
- Yeah, yeah.

00:04:01.694 --> 00:04:02.673
- Are you ready?

00:04:02.673 --> 00:04:03.506
- Yeah!

00:04:03.506 --> 00:04:04.353
- Okay.
- Okay, Jason...

00:04:04.353 --> 00:04:05.663
- (Jason) Oh god that's it.
- You're like...

00:04:05.663 --> 00:04:07.926
- (Jason) Oh god that's good. Oh wow.

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:08.822
- What?

00:04:08.822 --> 00:04:09.885
- (Jason) Ugh!

00:04:09.885 --> 00:04:10.718
- What?!

00:04:10.718 --> 00:04:12.635
- Ugh! Oooo god! Whooo!

00:04:17.718 --> 00:04:21.385
Oh my god baby! Oh my
god that's good! Whoo!

00:04:25.425 --> 00:04:26.419
Oh my god.

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:27.586
- That was it?

00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:32.417
- You're so good. Is that not good?

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:33.821
- No that wasn't good.

00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:34.654
That was weird and aweful.

00:04:34.654 --> 00:04:36.867
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:37.748
You know what it is?

00:04:37.748 --> 00:04:39.119
You are so hot.

00:04:39.119 --> 00:04:40.146
It's, it's...

00:04:40.146 --> 00:04:41.198
You know what it is?

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:42.224
It's a compliment.

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:44.309
You're so, you're so hot.

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:45.270
You know what?

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.844
You're the real thing
and no more porn for me.

00:04:47.844 --> 00:04:49.261
- Alright well...

00:04:52.041 --> 00:04:53.812
I guess thanks for the compliment.

00:04:53.812 --> 00:04:55.428
- You're welcome.

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:56.703
I love you.

00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:57.854
- Yeah...

00:04:57.854 --> 00:04:59.644
I'm gonna just...I'm
gonna go to the bathroom.

00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:00.722
- Okay.

00:05:00.722 --> 00:05:03.124
Oh you know what I would love right now?

00:05:03.124 --> 00:05:04.107
Doritos.

00:05:04.107 --> 00:05:06.137
- (Gasp) I think I hear her.

00:05:06.137 --> 00:05:08.083
Listen Mom, I'm gonna go get her.

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:09.403
- Go, go ahead!

00:05:09.403 --> 00:05:11.275
Go get the baby, we want to see her!

00:05:11.275 --> 00:05:12.503
- So just don't disconnect

00:05:12.503 --> 00:05:16.586
cause I don't want to go
through that again okay?

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:33.367
(moans)

00:05:33.367 --> 00:05:34.806
- What's going on?

00:05:34.806 --> 00:05:35.707
- I don't know.

00:05:35.707 --> 00:05:37.247
What...what is that?

00:05:37.247 --> 00:05:38.367
What are we seeing?

00:05:38.367 --> 00:05:39.336
(screams)

00:05:39.336 --> 00:05:41.069
- (Woman) Yes! Yes!

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.069
- (Gasp) Oh my god!

00:05:45.308 --> 00:05:47.705
- (Woman) Yes! Yes!

00:05:47.705 --> 00:05:49.504
- No wonder he doesn't want to get a job!

00:05:49.504 --> 00:05:52.617
He sits around the house
jerking off all day!

00:05:52.617 --> 00:05:54.404
- Oh my god!

00:05:54.404 --> 00:05:56.119
Oh no!
- (Woman) Yes!

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:57.369
Oh god, oh god!

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:59.272
- J?

00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:01.966
(knocks)

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:03.253
- Are you in there?

00:06:03.253 --> 00:06:04.390
(knocks)

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.140
Do you have my I-pad?

00:06:12.137 --> 00:06:13.137
- Oh my god.

00:06:17.917 --> 00:06:18.788
- Mom?

00:06:18.788 --> 00:06:19.871
Are you here?

00:06:21.554 --> 00:06:23.203
Got disconnected.

00:06:23.203 --> 00:06:24.389
Come here Char.

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:26.806
(band music)
