1
00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.180
Hi.
Uh,
we're ready?

2
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.420
<v 1>All right.
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burn?</v>

3
00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.300
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.

4
00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:10.700
And I don't know,
I've just been getting a bunch of guests lately.

5
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.580
It's time for another special one.
And I got another legend,

6
00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.310
the legend here.
I got the one and only Stephen Perkins from Jane's Addiction.

7
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.690
Hi Bill Porno for Pyros infectious grooves and your latest project,
uh,

8
00:00:24.691 --> 00:00:29.000
the think experience,
which we will be getting into.
Uh,
first off,

9
00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.200
thank you so much for doing this.
I've been a a huge fam.

10
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.160
You've already been talking.

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
And what happens when you break before you do a podcast?
It's like,
dude,

12
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:41.270
just save that and try and save that.
Yeah.
Say Nothing.
Say Nothing.

13
00:00:41.271 --> 00:00:45.800
Just let it flow.
Let the levy break.
Yes.
When the mic is on.
Yes.
So,
um,

14
00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.750
we were talking about,
uh,

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.210
basically the influence of the Internet and how good these,

16
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.380
these kids are at playing now,
but how it's like,

17
00:00:54.381 --> 00:00:57.860
almost like they all grew up in the same town.
Absolutely.
Yeah.

18
00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.780
Because everyone can just kind of go on youtube.

19
00:00:59.781 --> 00:01:02.030
And if there's some sick kid in Minnesota,

20
00:01:02.031 --> 00:01:04.910
you didn't have to live there to see him.
You just

21
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.910
<v 0>put it on and you watch it and then his influence goes into where you are.</v>

22
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:14.911
And then it's so widespread so quickly and there was such a fine romantic

23
00:01:15.041 --> 00:01:19.180
feeling to find a drummer or a record and fall in love with it and learn how to

24
00:01:19.181 --> 00:01:22.780
play it on.
No one else knew what you were working on your home alone.

25
00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.780
It could have been a cold train,
it could have been van Halen,

26
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.850
it could have been both at the same time,
you know,

27
00:01:27.851 --> 00:01:32.851
and try to kind of fuse this hybrid of yourself alone and the romance of a

28
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.470
drumstick and,
uh,
and,
and the rhythm.

29
00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.680
<v 1>How did you,
how did you come like about your style?
Like,</v>

30
00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.260
like blew my mind when I first heard you,

31
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:45.700
I missed the first few chains albums because I was,
I was,
you know,

32
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.340
[inaudible] hair metal and all that.
And,
um,
when ritual came out,

33
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.300
it's just like,
that was the first time I really heard somebody with a,

34
00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.390
uh,
that kind of music.

35
00:01:58.391 --> 00:02:01.810
Just the sound of that and just all the snare displacement and all that.
It just,

36
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:04.480
it just wasn't that approach.
Yeah.
Of like,
all right,

37
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.810
two and forced the snare and then I'm going to do some syncopated shit and

38
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.960
absolutely.
You know,
the base does this and I'm going to follow up with my foot.

39
00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:14.980
And you just had you,
it was completely,
it was like almost upside down.
Like how,

40
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.240
how did you arrive at that?

41
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.230
<v 0>Well,
I was,</v>

42
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
I think the great drummers have great musicians around them and that brings the

43
00:02:23.321 --> 00:02:27.250
competition in the jam room,
brings better performances out of each other.

44
00:02:27.251 --> 00:02:30.370
So I was ultra aware of technique and chops,

45
00:02:30.371 --> 00:02:33.460
but I knew that really wasn't my forte.

46
00:02:33.461 --> 00:02:36.670
I didn't want to be a fast lightening drummer and they really find a place for

47
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:41.560
that.
And the music I loved,
my early love was jazz buddy rich gene Krupa,

48
00:02:41.561 --> 00:02:45.820
Elvin Jones.
But no one in Los Angeles played trumpet,
Saxophone,
even piano.

49
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.350
No one even played bass.
Everyone played guitar.
So then what are you going to do?

50
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:52.090
You're going to bite into rock and roll.

51
00:02:52.091 --> 00:02:56.560
But that swung the board from the Sabbath bottom.

52
00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.770
And then I started to check out what the of Motown men and how that influence

53
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.940
Ringo and Charlie and Ginger Baker and they were playing these Motown beets are

54
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.380
surrounded by great songwriters,
right?
And so this,
this fusion,

55
00:03:11.381 --> 00:03:16.030
this hybrid of jazz swinging and the flash of rock and roll.

56
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.940
And then I kind of hit a ceiling.
I was bored.

57
00:03:18.941 --> 00:03:23.560
I didn't know what other record to by genesis rush,
everybody,
everything.

58
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.810
Then I sat,
you know,

59
00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.810
I found through the Beatles probably Indian tabla rhythms and that opened the

60
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:32.830
door to African rhythms,

61
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:37.690
which was fella cootie in Baba tuned de Alla tune g Jesus.
These guys deep.

62
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.860
I have no idea what that these records were just as important as the the Abbey

63
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:45.130
road record.
I try to make that impression on myself.

64
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.400
Let those records be become part of how important the,

65
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.540
the rhythm can be.
Not just these great songs that you grew up with.

66
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.980
Listen to new rhythms.

67
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.690
And so those rhythms started infuse my creative side.

68
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.210
And then I joined the marching band in high school.

69
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.650
So they have one shot and every one of us competitive,

70
00:04:05.651 --> 00:04:10.460
one in first chair and everyone was showing what they had the flash so that

71
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.850
there could be bad for your playing creatively,

72
00:04:12.851 --> 00:04:17.080
but it's good for your endurance and your confidence.
And how did,
so how did you,

73
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:22.081
when were you mature enough when you went in there to see that this isn't what

74
00:04:22.571 --> 00:04:25.630
it's about,
where it's like I would compare that in.
Uh,

75
00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.860
I've done a little bit of acting work and,
and I've,
I've a few,
uh,
very rarely,

76
00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:33.520
but a few times I've gotten into a scene with somebody and the silly as this

77
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:37.330
sounds,
they get in like I'm going to out act you.
Yeah,
exactly.
Rather than,
hey,

78
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:41.560
we're doing this together,
let's,
you know,
let's,
let's work together.
They get in,

79
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.880
they're like,
I'm going to out create you.
It's a,
there's a tennis match.

80
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:49.360
It's going on,
but you can't always aced the guy cause there's no match.

81
00:04:49.361 --> 00:04:50.720
You want to rally.
Right.

82
00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.210
So you do want to once in awhile just slam it in pink,

83
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.170
but you can't slam it every time.
Let's play,
let's rally,
let's laugh,

84
00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.120
let's communicate.
And I think growing up in the Vario at 15 on,

85
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.020
it was my love affair with you know,
guitar and drums.

86
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.490
I didn't know much about base and the rhythm section yet cause no one played

87
00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:14.560
bass.
So I always wanted to match the,

88
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.260
I always heard that if you played bass you could get into like 20 bands

89
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:18.094
immediately.

90
00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:21.760
[inaudible] nobody wanted it gives me the drums or guitar and sang if I'm one,

91
00:05:21.761 --> 00:05:23.110
you know.
So,

92
00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.290
but I think when the band Jane's Actually Kinda to become aware of our,

93
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.980
what was important was the lyrics and the freezing and he's not going to sing

94
00:05:35.261 --> 00:05:38.800
like this hair metal thing where you sing it four times and then you sing the

95
00:05:38.801 --> 00:05:41.860
next thing four times.
It's not going to rhyme.
It doesn't rhyme.

96
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:46.420
He says something once and then we react and then he says something three times

97
00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:50.200
and then he says motherfucker.
And then you punch it behind them and then,

98
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:54.250
you know,
and then so it's a poem with song and then,
you know,

99
00:05:54.251 --> 00:05:58.940
so I think we started to become ultra aware of how it's an emotional

100
00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.790
performance.
It's real estate.

101
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:05.720
Where are you going to place yourself and who are you going to get out of the

102
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.680
way of,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do,
do

103
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.790
you know,
where are you going to,
where are you going to put your plant?

104
00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.760
And almost like a monopoly game.
You go over and over,

105
00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.850
then you buy boardwalk and then you put a house on it.

106
00:06:19.851 --> 00:06:20.930
Then you put a hotel on it.

107
00:06:20.931 --> 00:06:25.430
You make your event more worthy when you guys know when you guys were going in

108
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:30.110
that direction because he means so much of it is you want to make it,
I mean,

109
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:31.830
you don't want to be homeless,
you know what I'm saying?

110
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.100
And what you guys were doing was so different despite when I listened to,

111
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:38.180
you know,
uh,
you know,

112
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.930
a lot of your influences were the stuff that those guys that I was listening to,

113
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:44.150
who the them the metal years were listening to.

114
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.660
When you start to make that departure of like,
I like,

115
00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.880
this does not sound like what they're,
what,
you know,
that big thing,

116
00:06:52.881 --> 00:06:55.040
what they're looking for.
Like what are you looking for a man?

117
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:57.630
What's the look this what was going on [inaudible] 85 the,

118
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.700
the Strip was coming to an end,
motley rat poison.
It was already ending.

119
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:04.910
Then they all been signed and it was repetitive,

120
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:07.310
redundant derivative of each other.

121
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.660
What Jane's addiction would go downtown and there was x and the minutemen,

122
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.610
the chili peppers and fish bone and they weren't successful as far as getting

123
00:07:16.611 --> 00:07:19.610
signed to a major.
They kind of hit a ceiling.

124
00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:23.180
The punk rock ceiling flag was there,
you know,
fear.

125
00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.630
It was circle jerks.
It was fucking fantastic,

126
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:28.190
but they weren't going to get any bigger.

127
00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.520
I remember x got a song in the Charlie Sheen movie,
the baseball movie,

128
00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:35.680
and I was like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
The W X got a song in the movie,

129
00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.300
doesn't make any sense because punk rock kid a ceiling.

130
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.080
So there was that moment where metal was done,
punk rock post punk.

131
00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.950
So when you're a world metal was done in [inaudible] 85,
yeah,

132
00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:49.640
there's already done,
it was gone in [inaudible] 93.

133
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:55.160
Zack was still poor.
But as it buys a player to create it as a,

134
00:07:55.170 --> 00:07:57.800
it's trying to turn the key a little and change,

135
00:07:57.801 --> 00:08:00.380
I didn't want to be Tommy Lee anymore.
You know,

136
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:04.700
there was a moment when you watch like,
uh,
like say,
you know,
he was still a kid.

137
00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.480
So MTV was so huge to our generation and,
and you know,

138
00:08:08.481 --> 00:08:12.860
this scene is over.
Yeah.
And and right as you're saying,
it's over.

139
00:08:12.861 --> 00:08:17.180
MTV is just as blowing get up to the next level.
And to the point,

140
00:08:17.620 --> 00:08:19.700
remember when they,
they,
they would do like the top 10.

141
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.420
And it was like other than like a Paula Abdul and a Janet Jackson,

142
00:08:23.421 --> 00:08:27.740
Michael Jackson,
like they could break in,
um,
George Michael,
those people go.

143
00:08:27.741 --> 00:08:32.741
But the rest of it was all pretty much hair metal if video's not civil or

144
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:38.480
pedestrian,
but safe in our opinion and completely produced and just the machine.

145
00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.780
So what would you watch?
Was there somewhat,

146
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:44.750
was there a cool MTV out there that you will watch it or we would go dig out,

147
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:47.420
which was,
you know,
Eric and Perry,

148
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:50.150
which are almost 10 years older than me and Dave,

149
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.040
they would help us realize the importance of joy division and bow house,

150
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:58.290
new order,
an echo and Susie,
do you know,

151
00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:02.880
I'm just discovering joy division now almost 40 years later.

152
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.840
That kind of simple storytelling.
Yeah,
cause me and Navarro,

153
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:08.700
we're about van Halen.
We wanted to show off.

154
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.880
They wanted to tell a story like those guys and cinematic set a scene and just

155
00:09:14.221 --> 00:09:17.850
tell the led the lyrics speak and of course mean they were still 18 weeks now we

156
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.930
can play,
watch this.
And that's what the world needed,
the metal,

157
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.090
that's what la needed.
And global,
but it was the end of metal and a punk.

158
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.320
You know,

159
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:32.520
even the chilies and fishbone had records out and our very first tunes before

160
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:34.650
ritual,
dare I say,

161
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:39.140
influenced La funk idiots rule the pigs and zen doodoo.

162
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:43.230
It was chilly pet could have been with the chili peppers show or a fish bone

163
00:09:43.231 --> 00:09:47.970
show.
And then we started to find our storytelling and our,

164
00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.140
and I think our best moment back then was then she did on ritual when the lyric,

165
00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:53.183
like I was saying,

166
00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.000
the lyric doesn't go four times and the music doesn't go three times behind.

167
00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.630
It's just that second side of that album.
I learned how to meditate.

168
00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:05.380
I swear to God,
I used to put it off to lift off.
Yeah.
And I would put it,

169
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.170
I would put it,
uh,
and I was really,

170
00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:11.280
it was like the first time in my life I was realizing that I was fucked up

171
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.840
because I look like Ron Howard,
my family looked like the Brady bunch.

172
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:19.590
We went to church every week and I thought,
hey,
you know,
I got this off fun.

173
00:10:19.591 --> 00:10:23.010
I was a fucking,
you know,
I went to work,
I was a good worker and all that.

174
00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.940
And it wasn't until uh,
that way and it's that weird thing.
I was right around 21,

175
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:30.000
22 and that's right when you're supposed to be done with college.

176
00:10:30.001 --> 00:10:32.760
You're supposed to know what you want and you're on your way to your dream or

177
00:10:32.761 --> 00:10:35.150
whatever.
I put everything else behind you and move on.
Yeah.

178
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.030
And I felt I was just sorta like floating like what the fuck?

179
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.680
Like that whole part of my life is done.
College just went by.

180
00:10:43.681 --> 00:10:48.570
I'm still a freshman basically.
Now what,
what the fuck am I doing?
And um,

181
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:51.900
I don't know.
That's my issue started coming up so well,
the,
the ritual record,

182
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:55.650
even though it was the end of the band was the,
this,

183
00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.000
what you're hearing is us on tour and shaving all the parts and playing them

184
00:11:00.001 --> 00:11:04.380
live and becoming an emotional organism.
And yeah,

185
00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.380
that's the documentation of what we sounded like.
And it was,

186
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.490
if we had a great manager,
he would have said,
take a year off.
I see a future.

187
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.980
I had a good manager,
just like you guys are gonna break up,
break up.

188
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.650
He wanted what was,
now we didn't give it to them so we didn't have any guidance.

189
00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:23.430
But infectious came immediately.
I was in Hawaii,
those guys showed up.

190
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:26.190
Robert and Trey,
you know,
arbitrary Hugh and Mike Mirror,

191
00:11:26.610 --> 00:11:29.280
they're going on to where the Ozzy in two weeks I'm in a new band.

192
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:32.730
So I didn't even think it was the wrong choice to break up.

193
00:11:32.731 --> 00:11:37.050
But why with something so beautiful and colorful,

194
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:40.860
just call quits.
No,
take a break.
And maybe,
you know,

195
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:44.570
like any hot relationship,
maybe take a break and then maybe see if it's,

196
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.580
it's still worthy,
but we didn't have any yeah.
Little space.

197
00:11:47.581 --> 00:11:51.150
And then they have a date night and hey,
see if you still like each other.
I mean,

198
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:51.311
I,

199
00:11:51.311 --> 00:11:56.311
I am so happy how the porno for pyros sound became something that was different

200
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:01.570
and we were able to grow and we didn't.
I love that Jane and I love the,
uh,

201
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.660
the second album.
Yeah,
that's uh,
that's still one.
Uh,
was it Tahitian moment?

202
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.510
God's earth station.
God,

203
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:13.660
I love that out that that making that record was using all the money Warner's

204
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:14.920
gave us to travel,

205
00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:18.160
write songs and then you just a little bit of money to record it.

206
00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:23.950
And I remember being all excited to watch Larry Sanders cause you guys were on

207
00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.620
the,
where you go in.
Uh,
yeah,

208
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.740
we had it all set up to do pets and then we got up there like that's going to be

209
00:12:29.741 --> 00:12:33.000
a board.
Let's do me high.
And that was a little more,
you know,
they'll charge.

210
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:36.680
Yeah.
But the band itself was,

211
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:41.770
was based on when I was saying earlier that that rhythm and phrasing of Perry

212
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:44.990
and I wanted to bring,
we didn't want to try to get uh,

213
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.060
a guitar soloist like we had in Jane's the greatest.
Right.

214
00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:53.390
So Peter was more of a songwriter on acoustic guitar 12 string and we were at

215
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.230
songs and with bongos around a campfire,
I want to say you hit you,

216
00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.480
you had like Bango sits where you would normally have like rack toms because we

217
00:13:01.481 --> 00:13:02.111
wrote the tunes,

218
00:13:02.111 --> 00:13:06.700
Campfire style with Bongos and acoustic guitars when we went into the studio.

219
00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:09.490
Those sounds and frequencies needed to be there.

220
00:13:09.491 --> 00:13:12.670
So I started to incorporate this hand drumming,

221
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:17.890
writing style into the drum kit and make a hybrid drum set so I'm not going to

222
00:13:17.891 --> 00:13:20.260
rely on beats.
So when you recorded that,

223
00:13:20.261 --> 00:13:23.830
did you play with sticks or were you playing with your hands on hot rods and

224
00:13:23.831 --> 00:13:26.390
sticks?
Good question.
You know,
the hot rods or the,

225
00:13:26.391 --> 00:13:28.840
the kind of splintered drumstick that,
oh,
is that,

226
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:32.590
what does that affect the quieter,
right?
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
And it kind of,
you know,

227
00:13:32.591 --> 00:13:33.790
you can get into,
it's still,

228
00:13:33.791 --> 00:13:36.550
but you don't have quite the attack and the articulation.

229
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.660
A little bit of Moroccan spread.
But I,
the approach,

230
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:44.770
because the bass player Martin was from Holland and he grew up with music.

231
00:13:44.771 --> 00:13:48.380
I couldn't reference any sabbath tune or ends up like,
you know,

232
00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.650
there's upland tuning,
you know,
he grew up in,
Holly couldn't,

233
00:13:50.651 --> 00:13:54.160
so that made it quite interesting,
you know,
as far as the rhythm section,

234
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:58.930
we had nothing to kind of fall back on.
So it was all very fresh.

235
00:13:59.050 --> 00:14:02.140
That's also interesting that someone could live in a part of the world that they

236
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.750
hadn't heard of Sam.
Exactly.

237
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:06.810
And that's Kinda sorta didn't everybody's like hard drive.

238
00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.710
It wasn't important like in America or Britain or the World Bank.
Yeah.

239
00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:16.290
That's interesting.
So right now you,
the thing you're doing right now is,
uh,

240
00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:21.760
uh,
think experience and this is like,
this is,
this really sounds cool.

241
00:14:21.761 --> 00:14:25.190
So this is in La.
Of course.
The cool shit seems to happen to your,

242
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:28.640
especially when I'm on the road.
Yeah.
When is it?
Yes.

243
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:33.190
When you're in West Virginia,
uh,
it's wisdom art park.
Yeah.
This,

244
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.000
this is a great experience with what we're doing is the saxophone is from pink

245
00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:39.790
Floyd and supertramp and Toto Scott Page.

246
00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:43.930
Me and him hooked up many years ago and we've always thought,

247
00:14:43.931 --> 00:14:47.170
wouldn't it be great to do pink Floyd music in our own way?

248
00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.670
Norwood from fishbone,
the Bass player,
Kenny Olson,
Guitar player from Kid Rock,

249
00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.510
we all were kind of hanging out in this pink Floyd state of mind.

250
00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:02.050
The Art Dome Wisdom opened up downtown and there were looking to fill the days.

251
00:15:02.571 --> 00:15:06.920
Sometimes they've got a spin class,
sometimes they've got a,

252
00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.020
you know,
a sound bath,
but it's always with these cool visuals.

253
00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.860
So we brought the band in there and then you basically,

254
00:15:15.861 --> 00:15:17.870
you can have either a folding seat,

255
00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:21.530
a beanbag or a futon bed and the visuals above you.

256
00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:25.010
It feels like you're a VR situation without the mask.

257
00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.160
So even the band members experiencing with the audiences,

258
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:31.040
I'll see you laying down and you look up at the dome.
So it's like wrap around.

259
00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:35.780
Exactly.
I'm a massive,
okay.
There's a couple of shows coming up.
You got to go.

260
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:40.280
There's other domes there that you can trip out on before the show and then the

261
00:15:40.281 --> 00:15:44.870
big dome homes about 500 people and we play about an hour and a half of all

262
00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:48.680
Floyd music with about 11 musicians to come and go at different singers.

263
00:15:49.220 --> 00:15:50.180
You can look at the band,

264
00:15:50.181 --> 00:15:53.960
but why everyone's tripping and oohing and Ahhing at the events visual.

265
00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.850
Are you looking?
I'm freaking out,

266
00:15:55.851 --> 00:16:00.851
looking up and I've always wanted back in the day what it was like not to be the

267
00:16:00.921 --> 00:16:03.920
cast member,
but the audience member.
During my gigs,

268
00:16:03.921 --> 00:16:08.510
especially Jane's and Porno and Shit was going on.
What's it like in there?

269
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:12.650
I want to,
I really am.
I'm just this,
we're seeing all the same thing.

270
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:17.030
Don't you find that once you've been like,
uh,
it took me a while,

271
00:16:17.031 --> 00:16:20.870
but I'm about 27 years in now.
Okay.
Seasoned at this point.

272
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:26.030
And one of my favorite things to do is to actually walk into someplace big or

273
00:16:26.031 --> 00:16:29.600
small where there's going to be the show and there's nothing on like I don't

274
00:16:29.601 --> 00:16:30.434
have to go to work,

275
00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160
stay off leaving school and I get to sit there and watch comedy or watch a band.

276
00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:42.140
Watch a game experience.
Yeah.
I love it.
I love that is my fuel,

277
00:16:42.141 --> 00:16:45.920
my father to play more.
I love a big show.

278
00:16:45.921 --> 00:16:49.640
Even though sometimes musically you're disconnected and the Faros way over there

279
00:16:49.641 --> 00:16:53.420
and Perry's hanging on a rope,
there's no visual moment,

280
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:55.700
but there's also some guide bungee jumping in a,

281
00:16:55.701 --> 00:16:59.060
in a Ferris wheel and you're playing mountain song at this is,

282
00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:03.230
what are they thinking?
I love that.
So I kinda get that experience.

283
00:17:03.231 --> 00:17:05.390
I get to be an audience member.

284
00:17:05.391 --> 00:17:08.840
What is that like when you're on your way up and it's like the first place is

285
00:17:08.841 --> 00:17:09.674
you're playing,

286
00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:13.130
it's almost the guys in your band are almost hitting your symbols and stuff at

287
00:17:13.250 --> 00:17:16.130
the tire and then all of a sudden it's just like,
Oh hey,

288
00:17:16.131 --> 00:17:18.130
we finally in a place where there's a little bit of wrong,
yeah,

289
00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.410
I don't have to play like this.
I can actually have my kid,
you know it's true.

290
00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:24.970
Well,
what we try to think that and when that gets big,
we tell the the text,

291
00:17:24.971 --> 00:17:27.320
please set us up close as much as possible,

292
00:17:27.321 --> 00:17:29.690
even though we need to be spread for the people way out there.

293
00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:34.430
Because once you start losing that,
that intimate connection with the band,

294
00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:37.150
the music does change.
It's kind of like being in a,

295
00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.610
on a phone call and the room is quiet.
You're gonna know everybody,
every,

296
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.150
every word you're thinking.
But if the room is loud and noisy,
you're like,
Oh hey,

297
00:17:44.151 --> 00:17:47.120
do you know what?
Yeah.
Oh Hey man,
come on in.
You know?

298
00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.490
That's kind of how the big shows are your like,
right,
I went to guitar player.

299
00:17:50.491 --> 00:17:53.500
Then you would have noticed something else is going on.
Right.

300
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:56.100
Did that ever cause you concern like you know,

301
00:17:56.340 --> 00:17:59.070
cause you always see your hair all like the Amy got four people,

302
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.660
four different personalities.
Absolutely.

303
00:18:00.661 --> 00:18:04.950
At one point you're just playing and you like this is my best friend way the

304
00:18:04.951 --> 00:18:07.590
fuck over this standing in front of a fucking fan.

305
00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:11.720
He hasn't looked at me the whole show.
What are we doing?
Who are we?
What is this?

306
00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.530
What is,
where's the band?
And somebody like crowd surfing and in which she is,

307
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:19.800
that's the weirdest thing about music.
Who was then becomes the height and,

308
00:18:19.801 --> 00:18:24.300
but then there's that disconnect.
Yeah.
I mean I got to think about you too.

309
00:18:24.301 --> 00:18:28.470
And the chilies and Metallica,
there's this connection they have with each other.

310
00:18:28.471 --> 00:18:33.180
That is it.
It seems to be very well threaded in tight,

311
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:33.661
you know,

312
00:18:33.661 --> 00:18:38.661
and even even stand close to each other on stage or they go satellite stage,

313
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:43.941
small little stage off the big one to show that unit and to feel that unit

314
00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.430
because I almost would feel like you guys would have to uh,

315
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:51.690
you know when you get as big as like that with a band that you would almost have

316
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:55.170
to schedule together time so you don't lose what got you there.

317
00:18:55.460 --> 00:18:57.390
One thing is great about always would change,

318
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.400
we have a backstage jam room and that is smaller instruments is a small amp,

319
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.693
small kit,

320
00:19:03.910 --> 00:19:08.640
little pa and we go back there and play our favorites plus the tunes maybe to

321
00:19:08.641 --> 00:19:11.700
warm up,
maybe tunes that'll be on stage and I possibly not,

322
00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:15.750
maybe a friend will come and sing with us those moments,
right.

323
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:18.420
Or the moments member of 1986,

324
00:19:18.421 --> 00:19:21.090
we wrote the tunes on Santa Monica and vine.

325
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:25.590
Now those early days we shared a rehearsal place BulletBoys,

326
00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.270
fishbone,
GNR and Jains.
And after you rehearse,

327
00:19:30.271 --> 00:19:33.960
you put your gear in the corner and then you bring it back the next day.

328
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:34.831
And I remember,

329
00:19:34.831 --> 00:19:37.860
you know the BulletBoys got a record deal and all of a sudden they had nuclear.

330
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:42.770
Oh Shit.
Yeah.
And then and then,
then Jean,
I got big,
their ship moved out.

331
00:19:42.930 --> 00:19:46.200
They've got their own room,
you know,
but you could see progress,
you know,

332
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:47.970
and again it's possible.
No,

333
00:19:47.971 --> 00:19:50.970
but then that set that panic thing like as a comic you start looking,

334
00:19:51.210 --> 00:19:55.360
well that guys,
he started two weeks after I did.
He's moving and he's up there.

335
00:19:55.361 --> 00:19:58.400
I like,
I must be doing something wrong now.
What was you,

336
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.640
so you actually sharing this space with people who are playing the music that

337
00:20:02.641 --> 00:20:06.750
people were saying,
this is it,
and you still had that,
that thing.
What did the,

338
00:20:06.930 --> 00:20:09.340
did the other guys like a g and R or a BulletBoys?

339
00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.650
Were they listening to what you were doing?
I'm tight with Jimmy Deanna,

340
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.620
the drummer from the boys,

341
00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.250
the BulletBoys and he said he was recognizing what was happening.

342
00:20:17.251 --> 00:20:22.251
He was not only feeling the sound was becoming redundant,

343
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:24.780
that was happening.
What's next?

344
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:28.440
But also the precision and the,

345
00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.040
the technic technical plane,
right.

346
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:33.870
Was being lost in that type of metal music.

347
00:20:33.871 --> 00:20:38.850
And so we were trying to bring back our love of rush,
you know,
genesis.
Yes.

348
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:41.790
You know,
there was like,
Whoa,
listen to what these cats are playing.

349
00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.250
Even though there's a story we need to tell where from Hollywood and something's

350
00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.970
going to the mirror,
the lyrics of the mirror.

351
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.060
You know what I was thinking that was saint to a buddy of mine the other night.

352
00:20:52.061 --> 00:20:54.790
Like you know everybody like ragging on disco,
like a big thing.

353
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.130
Everybody's saying.
I think that's like the worst fucking music ever.

354
00:20:57.490 --> 00:21:02.230
I will say the heavy metal ballad are some of the worst songs.

355
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:05.530
There's a few good ones scored me and it's just a fucked everybody.

356
00:21:05.531 --> 00:21:10.420
I mean the Scorps did one big one lady lady,
something about the,
you know,

357
00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:13.630
the Berlin Wall,
I can't recall,
but I couldn't remember.
It was home sweet home,

358
00:21:13.631 --> 00:21:16.720
which that's not one of the worst ones.
But there were some out there,

359
00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.790
the bands that became derivative,

360
00:21:18.791 --> 00:21:23.490
derivative derivative of a motley crew and yeah.
Yeah.
And then they,
that was,

361
00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:26.980
they had to do that.
Now I remember Keith Moon,
they said,
Keith,

362
00:21:26.981 --> 00:21:29.970
when did you stop destroying the drums?
Yeah,
we,

363
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:34.170
it's somehow stopped though.
You didn't notice,
but they stopped versus,
you know,

364
00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.420
and he said when it was in the set list of song number seven,
you know,

365
00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:41.460
destroy the drums.
You had to do it like we're done.
Oh Shit.

366
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:45.390
You Act like you're upset at your,
at your,
uh,

367
00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.020
your drum kit here.

368
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:51.450
Oh my God.

369
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.280
24 inch bass drum head with nothing.

370
00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.350
Shocking artwork.
All right,

371
00:21:57.370 --> 00:22:01.300
we got to take a picture then together afterwards everybody can see.
You know,

372
00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:04.570
you would love it.
Especially because you love art music and you play drums.

373
00:22:04.571 --> 00:22:08.800
There it is.
That thing's been on the drum head and on the drums on tour.

374
00:22:09.010 --> 00:22:10.330
But we never poke a hole in it.

375
00:22:10.331 --> 00:22:13.900
We caught the Mike Mountain on the inside cause I can't take this.
You actually,

376
00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:17.290
no,
are you kidding?
It's a gift.
It's a gift to you cause you low enough.

377
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:20.920
This is going up in my drum room dude.
Like what did you do this?
You got it man.

378
00:22:20.921 --> 00:22:23.620
What you do for music and art.
And I was uh,

379
00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.160
I don't know if you've seen my act lately.

380
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.680
I don't know if I'm doing all of that good point.

381
00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.790
While he'd say it was a good thing,

382
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.940
I inspire you to go into different directions.

383
00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:35.430
Like my act is basically like a heavy metal ballot and I'm sending it on

384
00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.240
inspiring other comics that go in and do a different,
uh,
direction.
Well,

385
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:44.380
my advice to anybody trying to be a drummer or a musician,

386
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.760
of course it's technique,

387
00:22:45.761 --> 00:22:50.761
but don't look for that pat on the back because that's a bore you want to piss

388
00:22:50.861 --> 00:22:51.694
people off.

389
00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:56.820
My actual goal is a drummer is to think of my three favorite artists.

390
00:22:58.910 --> 00:23:03.280
They're the big ones.
Salvador Dali,
because he can paint like Rembrandt,

391
00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:06.750
but he doesn't,
he puts a fucking rooster coming out of the head.
You know,
it's,

392
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.580
it looks wheel.
You look closely,
it's broken.

393
00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:13.630
And then there's MC Escher with the black duck and the white duck and the

394
00:23:13.631 --> 00:23:18.610
rhythms and just continue the patterns.
I,
that's a drumming pattern in,
in art.

395
00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:21.130
So this is way beyond me.
And then there's Pollock.

396
00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:25.750
He spent his whole life like all of us trying to become,
he's used as a brush,

397
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.830
right?
And I want it to be bottom.
And then he said he threw the paint.

398
00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:33.460
And that's what I thought.
That's what do I do when they give me a rock riff?

399
00:23:33.461 --> 00:23:38.050
I'm going to do Baba tune geology,
tune g to me.
You know what I mean?
No,

400
00:23:38.051 --> 00:23:42.630
I don't be on me,
dude.
I hate when I go to museums.
They make me feel dumb heard.

401
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:45.980
So I go there and I'm just like,
I don't get what everybody's doing,
but

402
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:50.210
<v 1>my wife is gradually trying to get me to be a little more,
uh,</v>

403
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:53.330
<v 0>well,
the rhythm is so visual and of course even our bodies,</v>

404
00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:56.450
whatever your digestive rhythm is or your sleep rhythm,

405
00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.480
you're saying whatever it is,
we all have a rhythm and makes us feel

406
00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.730
<v 1>well,
what are you,
what are you,
what are you thinking when you're playing?</v>

407
00:24:02.731 --> 00:24:06.430
Because you always have like the biggest smile and it's like,

408
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.370
like even if I didn't play drums,

409
00:24:08.371 --> 00:24:11.550
I'd be watching you get guys having the time of his life.

410
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.170
<v 0>I am.
That is the,
I can't do wrong.</v>

411
00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.540
Of course I can drop the stick or pull off something.

412
00:24:17.541 --> 00:24:20.870
The Ego can strike you if you think too much,
like you got it right,

413
00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.730
but I can't do wrong as far as I remember seeing gene Krupa play drums in a,

414
00:24:25.731 --> 00:24:29.360
in a movie and they showed a guy,
a conservative couple.

415
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:32.540
He was tapping his hand and the wife's like [inaudible] but they went to her

416
00:24:32.541 --> 00:24:34.320
foot.
She was tapping her foot.
Right.

417
00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.520
That's what drums make me feel like I cannot lose.

418
00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:41.480
I'm going to make people feel good and life fucking sucks.
Everything sucks.

419
00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.020
Or the world,
the news,
the shit,
what is good and he's like my kid,

420
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:49.610
my wife and the drums and I,
there's something fun.

421
00:24:49.611 --> 00:24:52.670
I remember my friends came by and I bought a cow bell and I learned how to play

422
00:24:53.150 --> 00:24:56.600
beautiful girl or a dancing either way,
van Halen

423
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.600
and my friends like,
holy Jesus.
I was like,
you know,
this is exciting.

424
00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:05.960
It's hitting a home run for my friends or strangers.

425
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.330
<v 1>But it's,
it is,
I got,
you know,</v>

426
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.650
I've got to compliment you hear as far as like the fact that your whole career,

427
00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:17.720
you've always been going towards the art thing and then somehow it pays off,

428
00:25:17.721 --> 00:25:22.260
which is very rare because usually when you go that route it's painful.
Yeah.
Yes.

429
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:27.680
You're on the,
uh,
you were on the Futon.
Train is usually way where you're at,

430
00:25:27.681 --> 00:25:28.790
but you've,
you've always,

431
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:33.860
and then when you arrived with Jane's and then you still were able to go back to

432
00:25:33.861 --> 00:25:36.980
be like,
no,
this,
this feels good.
Let's,
let's put the bond goes in here.

433
00:25:36.981 --> 00:25:41.420
Let's do that,
which was the one,
nobody was doing that.
And what,
um,

434
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:42.830
I've experienced this in,

435
00:25:42.831 --> 00:25:47.831
in my career where I've gotten something and then I think of my next move and my

436
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:49.820
next moves thinking,
well,
I'm here.

437
00:25:50.030 --> 00:25:54.650
I got to try to stay here or go to that next thing.
And it's like a,
you know,

438
00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.190
a two week or a two month hangover.
Absolutely.
The rush of that thing.

439
00:25:58.191 --> 00:26:01.130
And you gotta be like,
well,
now wait a minute.
Why did I want,

440
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:04.100
what was the reason I got into this business?
What did I want to do?

441
00:26:04.101 --> 00:26:08.210
So then it always goes back to going down to the clubs,

442
00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:13.160
trying out a new bid,
having making another comic laugh.
Absolutely.

443
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:14.360
Have them come up,
come to you,

444
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.780
going to do this something there and then fee and then driving home,
you know,

445
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:22.010
did a guest spot,
made no fucking money,
driving home,
excited going.

446
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.650
And then you're thinking and you're talking to yourself and people looking at

447
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:29.490
your at red lights and you don't give a fuck on,
I come in and go down.
Um,
that's

448
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.290
<v 0>the organic fuel that I still get.
I love those drum events and competitions.</v>

449
00:26:34.291 --> 00:26:37.800
Even though the gospel chops of invaded.
But you see,

450
00:26:37.801 --> 00:26:39.990
everybody must've rehearsed for the last two months.

451
00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:44.960
You can see the pros that have a 40 minute performance.
They,
you can tell,

452
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.310
you can tell if you,
I mean,
I would think cause those kids,

453
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:49.660
that's such a huge shot,
that guitar center thing.
Yeah.

454
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.850
That's going to put it to sleep now.
But you're right,
it was big.
Yeah.
It helped.

455
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:56.300
No,
I mean I still follow those at like a couple,

456
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:59.760
two or three drummers that I became huge fans of it and watching their bands and

457
00:26:59.761 --> 00:27:04.560
stuff.
Um,
but it's good for this.
It's good for the scene.

458
00:27:04.561 --> 00:27:08.940
It's good for dramas.
Yeah.
I those competitions like,
you know,

459
00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.530
it makes a pros and amateurs tune up,

460
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:17.400
practice more,
practice more.
That's it.
Let me,
I,
I try to ask,

461
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:21.360
uh,
if I remember when I get with somebody of your talent level.

462
00:27:21.361 --> 00:27:22.980
So the big thing you're always chasing,

463
00:27:22.981 --> 00:27:26.230
no matter what you're doing is kind of getting into a zone where it's like you

464
00:27:26.231 --> 00:27:28.500
not even thinking.
And it's just flowing through you and have any,

465
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:33.060
do you have a way of like,

466
00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:34.590
um,

467
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.220
if you're feeling like I'm in my head and I'm thinking about and now I'm hitting

468
00:27:38.221 --> 00:27:43.170
the bass drum and I,
but do you have any mental exercise that you do to a Steve,

469
00:27:43.171 --> 00:27:46.260
get out of your fucking head.
You're,
you're in New Jersey right now.

470
00:27:46.290 --> 00:27:48.290
Look at that person over there.
Take them in.

471
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.860
Like do you have any tricks to get you out of the worst artistics space,

472
00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:56.130
which is sitting between your fucking ears.
Absolute thinking.
What do you do?

473
00:27:56.140 --> 00:28:01.140
I mean there is so many ways as a drummer I can sit and practice and I'm alone a

474
00:28:02.071 --> 00:28:05.700
lot and there's a lot of alone time and a lot of my musician friends have a

475
00:28:05.701 --> 00:28:09.000
different schedule and not a lot of my non musician friends have a job.

476
00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.450
What am I going to do with my day?
I don't want to be faster.

477
00:28:12.451 --> 00:28:15.600
I just want to be more alert and be able to pull things off.

478
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.550
Then I'm thinking with the technique,

479
00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:22.680
but there is the time I'm sitting at the drum kit and I'm like,
this is 100% me.

480
00:28:22.690 --> 00:28:24.330
This is so boring,
right?

481
00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:28.230
Do a one 80 what exactly don't exactly what you wouldn't play.

482
00:28:28.231 --> 00:28:33.090
Go against your instinct and force it over and over and see what happens.

483
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:37.530
Yeah,
and so I have to force myself to it's,
you know,

484
00:28:37.531 --> 00:28:41.820
get away from the endurance and the technique and the speed and the flow.

485
00:28:42.330 --> 00:28:44.520
What's,
what's going to Zap me creatively?

486
00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:48.420
How the heck am I going to wake up creatively and come up with something new?

487
00:28:48.570 --> 00:28:51.210
Is it putting a Bango in front of me that will help,

488
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.090
but that's not going to do it.
I've got to hit the thing.

489
00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:57.720
How do you do this on tour?
You're on tour,
you're 40 fucking dates in.

490
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.590
You want to go home,
you miss your wife and kid and you're,
you know,
come up,

491
00:29:01.620 --> 00:29:04.320
lights go down and crowds going crazy and you're thinking like,
oh Jesus,

492
00:29:04.321 --> 00:29:06.750
I would love to go back and take a fucking nap.
What do you do then?

493
00:29:06.870 --> 00:29:11.520
I'm a complete believer in waking up and exploring cities,

494
00:29:11.521 --> 00:29:15.810
towns,
people,
the best sandwich shop,
the best record shop,

495
00:29:15.811 --> 00:29:19.650
the fountain where the punks hang out and then bring that to the Gig.

496
00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:23.430
Even feed it to the singer.
Hey,
they've got a fountain down on third.

497
00:29:23.700 --> 00:29:26.850
I was at the fountain on third.
The place goes nuts.

498
00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.720
That's a turnoff for everybody.
I love that.
And I,

499
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:35.370
and I put that into my plane and I,
I tried to,
okay,

500
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:37.650
why am I here?
Only play for 75 minutes.

501
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:41.560
This is a whole day away from home or whatever,
you know,
I'm missing.

502
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:46.960
<v 1>And so I do try to fuel it with that.
I'm fucking lucky.
I'm out of town.</v>

503
00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:51.970
I'm,
I'm,
I got a gig tonight,
let's go enjoy.
Right.
I,
as a drummer,
the recognition,

504
00:29:51.971 --> 00:29:55.240
you don't get much of it.
You walk around town.
I don't have anybody bothering me.

505
00:29:55.241 --> 00:29:56.850
I don't know if that would be an issue.
Right.

506
00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:01.780
I can imagine if you don't want to be recognized and you want that world to get

507
00:30:01.781 --> 00:30:04.990
out there,
it could be a bomber.
Right.
Fucking really famous.
You know,
like,

508
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:05.891
you know what,
I always wish,

509
00:30:05.891 --> 00:30:09.670
I always wish they had that thing from star trek and be at home with your wife

510
00:30:09.671 --> 00:30:11.710
and kid and kiss them.
All right,
I'm going to work.
And then they just,

511
00:30:11.711 --> 00:30:15.010
you just big beam beam you'd have Toronto was something,
I mean,

512
00:30:15.011 --> 00:30:18.520
how many times I want to clone to send them off to do the Gig.
Yeah.

513
00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.740
And that's why I like Ag.

514
00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:23.860
That's always a scary thought because then I sit there going,

515
00:30:23.861 --> 00:30:28.480
who the fuck am I to be?
Not,
you know,
enjoying this right now.
But then it's like,

516
00:30:28.510 --> 00:30:32.680
oh that,
well that's what makes human beings move forward is you get bored.
Yeah,

517
00:30:32.681 --> 00:30:35.740
exactly.
We cannot just be there and just go,
this is perfect.

518
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:40.550
I'm going to try over and over.
You know what I do is I just,
I go out and uh,

519
00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.440
I try and just walk out and not say anything for my act.

520
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.920
This is how I get myself out of my head.
And then if that's not happening,

521
00:30:47.950 --> 00:30:49.900
even when I go into my joke,

522
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:54.160
what I start to do is I just try to tag it with different lines and blah blah

523
00:30:54.161 --> 00:30:54.760
blah blah.

524
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:58.570
You don't be like the muse musical equivalent be improving on whatever like

525
00:30:58.571 --> 00:31:01.120
musical phrase it is and let's blow that out.

526
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.960
It's usually takes 92nd now it's going to take two minutes and 10 seconds.

527
00:31:05.170 --> 00:31:05.551
But just,

528
00:31:05.551 --> 00:31:09.430
just the fact that those last 40 seconds that it's something that I hadn't said

529
00:31:09.431 --> 00:31:13.240
before,
even if it sucks,
even if I'm eating shit,
it's just like,

530
00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.170
oh I'm bombing in Columbus,
Ohio is where I am right now.

531
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.870
These people don't feel like they're getting their money's worth and then that

532
00:31:19.871 --> 00:31:21.160
gets the adrenaline going.

533
00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.760
So I learned over the years because I used to not know how to get out of that

534
00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.480
and I would spend weeks or possibly like months and then you get into like

535
00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:33.020
writer's block and I had to like figure out like how my brain works.

536
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.300
Like it works in a very straight line where like if I introduce yourself,

537
00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:39.640
well if I,
like if I thought about a show,

538
00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.570
I said three things that I liked and if I said one that I said early in the show

539
00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:47.380
and then one in the middle of money and if the first one I thought about was in

540
00:31:47.381 --> 00:31:51.010
the middle,
that's where the tape starts and everything before it gets a race.

541
00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:55.240
Gotcha.
So I'm just like,
alright,
I don't know what the fuck that is,

542
00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:58.030
but that's how my brain works.
So I have to,
um,

543
00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:02.860
I've kind of learned like I don't tape shows and when I say something and I'm

544
00:32:02.861 --> 00:32:05.290
trying to remember,
I can't,
I just,
I let it go.
And Michael,
that's,

545
00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:08.740
that's how it was said.
I learned that from watching you guys.
It was just like,

546
00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:11.410
hey,
that's how the song came out that night.
That's the fill I played.

547
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:13.810
That's the thing,
the guy saying you don't have,

548
00:32:13.870 --> 00:32:16.360
everything isn't so fucking precious,
precious.

549
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:18.430
And there's also a sense of humor to it.

550
00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:22.780
And that's what me and Navarro in Perry playing the chain song so many times

551
00:32:22.781 --> 00:32:24.220
with different bass players.

552
00:32:24.430 --> 00:32:29.430
We all have duff mckagan and we had everything yet Chris and flea and,

553
00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.110
and we kind of play with the arrangement.
Perry,

554
00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:36.400
you might just not sing the verse and dance around and play.

555
00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:40.110
It's playful and you have to know.
It's just,
you know,
there's,
that's a

556
00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.480
<v 0>serious man.
It's a song.</v>

557
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:45.650
But if you're in the moment that makes it fun and I'll do something like make my

558
00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:49.870
tech laugh or from Navarro or we'll do something backstage prior to the show of

559
00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.150
Van Halen Ref.
And then Dave will pull it out during the Gig and look at me.

560
00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.530
That's fucking so cool.
It's kind of,
that's so cool.

561
00:32:57.650 --> 00:33:00.950
He's a powerful force that they'll,
people are enjoying it at the same time.

562
00:33:00.951 --> 00:33:05.951
There's an inner inside show within the show that is so fucking cool.

563
00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:07.930
It's one of the dates of this,
this uh,

564
00:33:07.940 --> 00:33:12.020
the first weekend of April in the last weekend of April,
that wisdom art park.

565
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:14.990
All right,
so the first two weekends in April,
I'm going to,

566
00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.170
I'm actually going to buy tickets before first weekend and last weekend.
Oh,

567
00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.223
first Friday and Saturday.

568
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:22.550
So I have to go the first weekend because I'm out of town the last weekend and

569
00:33:22.551 --> 00:33:25.910
I'm going to fucking get these tickets before this thing hits because I want to

570
00:33:25.911 --> 00:33:29.550
go see that.
I want to be fucking blade and my back.
Listen in or watch.
Yeah,

571
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.370
it's a next level experience in going with the beanbag too.

572
00:33:32.390 --> 00:33:34.730
Can I request that the,
I'll make sure you had the bag.

573
00:33:35.030 --> 00:33:38.240
I had my nine year old come and he had brought like three or four friends and

574
00:33:38.241 --> 00:33:38.600
they were,

575
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:42.860
the other room's got a VR mask and one room is made of mirrors and light and

576
00:33:42.861 --> 00:33:44.760
they were just exploring everything.
Right.

577
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:48.290
And that's so cool because now with my music means more than just,

578
00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:53.210
oh he's a drummer they can realize.
And his friends,
it's an experience.

579
00:33:53.211 --> 00:33:54.170
I'm just a slice of it,

580
00:33:54.171 --> 00:33:59.171
but I want them to share this new technology because it's there and you know,

581
00:33:59.811 --> 00:34:02.540
we can't ignore it and it's,
the Ai is here,

582
00:34:02.541 --> 00:34:04.670
but I want to use it as entertainment.

583
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.680
But of course there's other ways to show your kids think.

584
00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:10.670
It's cool that you play drums.
He loves it,
man.
That's awesome.
You know,
sit,

585
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.700
you know,
to get to that teenage years it's like,
Oh my God,
Dad,

586
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:18.530
oh he's dying being a rock star and he's nine.
He's got time.
Oh,
that's so cool.

587
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:22.540
Well,
um,
I don't know.
What else did I want to talk about here?
Oh,
you got,
uh,
your,

588
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:27.080
uh,
what do I got down here?
Oh,
I wanted to talk to you about the,
uh,

589
00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:30.870
when did you start playing barefoot?
This is what I'm going deep,
but,
oh,

590
00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.760
let's go to people who aren't like drummers that listen,

591
00:34:32.761 --> 00:34:34.130
like what they've got home from school,

592
00:34:34.131 --> 00:34:39.131
1213 shoes and socks off that and then play drums until about five or six.

593
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.550
So I think that's just the natural,
taking the shoes and socks off at home.

594
00:34:43.830 --> 00:34:48.710
And I play heels up and I played with the balls of my foot and I toes and I move

595
00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:53.050
up and down the pedal.
So there's no comfort zone with a,
with a shoe on,
right.

596
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:56.240
I get cramped and my toe was going like a snail in there.

597
00:34:56.241 --> 00:34:58.970
It's like it's not working right.
But uh,

598
00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:03.980
there is something to say about the feeling of an extra weight of a shoe and I

599
00:35:04.611 --> 00:35:05.840
definitely get a different sound.

600
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.660
Want to have a shoe on and maybe there's a little more beef behind it.

601
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.570
I wasn't going to ask you if like you're at a club.
Oh,
Steven's,
hey,

602
00:35:11.571 --> 00:35:16.190
come in and sit in on a second.
Tom Rogers and take off your shoes and socks.

603
00:35:16.570 --> 00:35:19.460
That's awful.
No,
I don't,
I use what they guy,

604
00:35:19.490 --> 00:35:22.430
but when I get comfortable behind my kid,

605
00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:27.200
I'd prefer to be in a pair of shorts and nothing else and play.

606
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.980
Do you still have the kit that you played on ritual?
Do you still have this,

607
00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:35.960
what kind of drum kit was it?
That was at my,
uh,
1980 or 79 Ludwig.

608
00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.560
That was a,
and then on ritual while that with doing ritual,

609
00:35:40.561 --> 00:35:45.090
we used some of my brand new DW kid as well,
which was just weeks old,

610
00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:49.740
but there was a,
a tour that we just finished using the same drums over and over.

611
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:51.690
So you have that feeling.
This is funny.

612
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:55.980
When Jane's Addiction got Our first 10 k we go,
let's go buy a new gear.

613
00:35:56.360 --> 00:36:00.560
Navarro played Marshall's,
he went,
got Mesa Boogie Bass player played an page.

614
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:04.760
You got trace Elliot.
I had cracked Zildjian's.
I went and got pasty.

615
00:36:04.770 --> 00:36:08.340
We went to rehearsal.
Sounded horrible.
Where was our sound?
It just,

616
00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.070
we just bought a bunch of new gear,
just put it in the corner.

617
00:36:11.071 --> 00:36:14.250
It was a waste of money.
We got our old shit back.
Oh no,

618
00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:18.390
because that was how we sounded.
We needed,
we didn't need to go buy,

619
00:36:18.900 --> 00:36:19.700
gather.

620
00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.820
<v 1>Isn't that funny?
Yeah.</v>

621
00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:25.760
You were sitting there like longing for this other stuff and you already had it.

622
00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.530
We had what we needed,
man.

623
00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.530
And I remember just putting all this shit in the corner was like,
oh wow.

624
00:36:30.690 --> 00:36:35.120
There was 10 k.
You know
what else?
Uh,

625
00:36:35.121 --> 00:36:38.150
you also did a project with one of the,
uh,
the players from all the strokes,

626
00:36:38.151 --> 00:36:38.984
right?
That's right.

627
00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.350
<v 0>Nikolai,
the Bass player and I have a base,</v>

628
00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.080
we have a band called the summer moon and we just did a bum,

629
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:49.060
maybe about 1530 shows opening for Danny Harrison.

630
00:36:49.420 --> 00:36:53.320
And it's such a cool community of young,
thoughtful musicians,

631
00:36:53.321 --> 00:36:58.321
creative people that are hungry to change and try new ideas onstage.

632
00:36:58.690 --> 00:37:02.970
Backstage in this,
in the studio is,
is that a,
uh,

633
00:37:03.570 --> 00:37:05.460
<v 1>is that a new project that you're working with?
Like,</v>

634
00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.140
like the album's coming summer moon,

635
00:37:07.141 --> 00:37:10.830
we did an p about about a year ago and there's another AP common right now.

636
00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.040
Cause that band the strokes was a band that I was like,

637
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:19.041
I was like officially like old cause I was freaking out and I always just like,

638
00:37:19.801 --> 00:37:23.130
I don't know who anybody is or kids.
So what is that name?
They kids.

639
00:37:23.131 --> 00:37:26.880
And I was looking at him going like,
Oh my God,
I'm like almost like 15,
12,

640
00:37:26.881 --> 00:37:31.380
15 years older than them.
And uh,
but that's another thing.
Like,
I,

641
00:37:31.381 --> 00:37:35.130
I have to go back.
All the music that I missed when I was growing up.

642
00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:37.230
I had to go back and start listening to that.

643
00:37:37.231 --> 00:37:39.930
And then there was the shit that I missed in the 90 especially hip hop and all

644
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:41.070
that stuff of stuff that I missed.

645
00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:45.840
And then now I'm kind of getting into the two thousands and just like

646
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:51.240
20 years too late for those guys.
So I,
uh,
I dunno,

647
00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:54.450
this is a touch shit.
There's so much shit that to try and listen.

648
00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.300
<v 0>So,
but you know what I loved at the end of the eighties,</v>

649
00:37:56.301 --> 00:37:58.760
early nineties was the sound of the drummer.

650
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:04.180
He had something to say a primus and Soundgarden and tool and Earl pearl jam and

651
00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:07.340
every drummer had something different than the other.

652
00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:11.330
And I think the metal days you're talking about every drummer wanted to be t Lee

653
00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:13.440
and the,
you know,
it just wasn't happening,

654
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.660
but it was a chance now to be yourself.
And the things change again,

655
00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:20.750
it comes in waves.
You know,
that creative flow from the rhythm section.

656
00:38:21.380 --> 00:38:25.850
<v 1>Have you seen the,
a Motley Crue movie yet?
The man,
I can't wait.
Oh,
it's so good.</v>

657
00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.980
It's so like,
it's just,
it's perfect motley crew.

658
00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.550
It's just awesome.
It ridiculous.

659
00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.170
Just total and true.
True.
Yeah.

660
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.020
Cause somebody from the La Times gave one of them shit going like,
you know,

661
00:38:41.021 --> 00:38:44.090
cause they showed like all the groupies that they were bagging and everything we

662
00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:49.240
think and they were just like,
just total at the time.
Yeah,
me too.

663
00:38:49.241 --> 00:38:52.390
Blah blah,
blah blah.
I think it was Tommy.
He was just like,
well,

664
00:38:52.391 --> 00:38:55.300
I mean it happened.
I mean,
do you want us to like rewrite history?

665
00:38:55.301 --> 00:38:59.920
What are we doing here?
And a story we're telling the story.

666
00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.100
Yeah.
It was a really,
uh,
yeah,

667
00:39:03.101 --> 00:39:05.680
it was I plastic motley crew and it was dark,

668
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.060
but in the end overall it was like fun.
Yeah.
It was just,
and you walked out like,

669
00:39:10.061 --> 00:39:13.750
dude,
what the fuck was that?
Like classic Motley show.
I just,

670
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:16.290
I can't say enough good things about,
uh,

671
00:39:16.330 --> 00:39:20.620
I always fuck up that expression.
It's just fucking awesome.
I loved it.

672
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:22.740
<v 0>I loved it.
Well,
I got to play with Tommy.</v>

673
00:39:22.741 --> 00:39:26.790
We had methods may have double drummer and we sat right next to each other and I

674
00:39:26.791 --> 00:39:30.360
took the floor Tom out.
And that's where his high hat was.
That's how close.

675
00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:31.770
Oh Wow.

676
00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.980
And then he's saying he play guitar while I drummed and then he joined me.

677
00:39:35.310 --> 00:39:35.941
And let me tell you,

678
00:39:35.941 --> 00:39:38.970
I mean that did the rehearsals were the highlights because you had two hours of

679
00:39:38.971 --> 00:39:39.750
me in him,

680
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:43.110
the band for hours and then they would split and he's like Perkins menu going

681
00:39:43.111 --> 00:39:45.710
all night.
It's t lead drummer.

682
00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.150
<v 1>Yeah.
It was just,
I was just as bad ass.</v>

683
00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.670
And I was just listening to that album bet.

684
00:39:51.730 --> 00:39:55.240
The one who was just called Motley crew where they had that,
that other sets,

685
00:39:55.241 --> 00:39:58.750
right?
Yeah.
Dude,
that album is so fucking underrated.
There's like,
if,

686
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:01.150
first of all they put out an hour and you can see what they were doing.

687
00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.580
It's like,
oh,
we got a new singer,
we got to go hard.
It's,

688
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:08.590
I think it's Tommie's best drumming and mixed fire.
Mick's best fucking riffs.

689
00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:12.160
And that singer was just,
it was,
it wasn't,
was,
uh,
was incredible.

690
00:40:12.161 --> 00:40:14.530
And I was listening.
I put it on and was at the gym.

691
00:40:14.531 --> 00:40:17.320

778
00:45:27.121 --> 00:45:30.180
teeth.
Goddamn right,

Quip is the best electric toothbrush created by dentists and designers.

784
00:45:47.730 --> 00:45:51.630
People brush too hard in some electric toothbrushes are too abrasive.

790
00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:13.440
Why declutters your sink or cabinets and makes traveling with an electric

791
00:46:13.441 --> 00:46:14.490

792
00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:19.710
Quip doesn't require a clunky charger and runs for three months on one charge.

recommended schedule every three months for just five bucks.

795
00:46:27.540 --> 00:46:32.430
Why three out of four of us use bristles that are old,
worn out and ineffective.

796
00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:34.260
Quip is the one of,

Well,
I don't have one,

800
00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:47.370
but the fact that I only have to charge it once every three months,

801
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:49.680
I'm in love with it.
I'm going to have an affair.

802
00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.790
I have to talk to my wife about this toothbrush and that's why I love quip and

858
00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:39.790
<v 4>hey,
what's going on?
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for fun day.</v>

859
00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:46.500
The fuck is it?
March 28th,
2011 oh God.

860
00:50:46.501 --> 00:50:48.870
How it's march already over

861
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:53.040
and like a lamb out like a lion.

862
00:50:53.041 --> 00:50:56.010
Did the fucking goat see its shadow?

863
00:50:57.260 --> 00:50:59.010
That's one of the great things about living in a desert.

864
00:50:59.011 --> 00:51:02.220
You don't have to listen to that dumb shit when it comes to February and March.

865
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:05.880
You know when you live in the desert,
the desert area,

866
00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:10.470
I don't have to deal with that shit.
What do you think's going to happen?

867
00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:13.800
It's been so mild in the beginning of March.

868
00:51:13.801 --> 00:51:17.460
Does that mean it's going to get temp to with towards the end?

869
00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:22.740
I don't know.
There Sharon.
I don't know what's going to fucking happen.

870
00:51:22.741 --> 00:51:26.850
All I know is that it's going to be 70 degrees out every day for the rest of my

871
00:51:26.851 --> 00:51:29.370
life.
Provided I stay out here.

872
00:51:30.850 --> 00:51:34.260
I'm speaking of the desert.
I a actually visited a friend of mine,

873
00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:38.930
visited it at it.
A friend of mine.
I'm out in the desert buddy.

874
00:51:39.330 --> 00:51:43.500
Mind it said,
uh,
at a baby girl.
Well,
he didn't have it.
His wife had it.

875
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:47.610
Who else do,
I'm sorry.
It's an old joke.

876
00:51:47.730 --> 00:51:51.870
I'm sorry.
I'm get settled in here and getting settled in.

877
00:51:51.871 --> 00:51:55.500
Let me get settled into the podcast before you start rolling your fucking eyes

878
00:51:55.501 --> 00:52:00.270
at me and you God cubicle.
All right.
Little Miss.
Ooh,

879
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.890
I'm going to get an office someday.
Is that what you think that,
that,

880
00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:06.210
that cubicle represents?
Look at.

881
00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:10.800
They already gave me half the walls and no ceiling.
I mean,

882
00:52:10.801 --> 00:52:15.060
where else can you go from here someday?
I'll have a door.

883
00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:21.180
Um,
I got news for Ya.
All right?
If you're in a cubicle right now,

884
00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:25.220
why don't you fucking grow a Dick?
That includes though,

885
00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:29.520
ladies,
get some fucking balls.
All right?

886
00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:31.770
Take out a quarter.

887
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:37.410
And why don't you stick it in those plastic bolts that are holding the walls of

888
00:52:37.411 --> 00:52:40.620
your cubicle up.
All right,
I'm not saying take your fucking cubicle down.

889
00:52:40.621 --> 00:52:43.860
Why don't you just loosen them up,
add a little chaos to the day.

890
00:52:43.861 --> 00:52:48.420
So next time your boss comes over like that Douche in that movie office going,

891
00:52:48.421 --> 00:52:53.040
yeah,
I'm going to need you to.
Yeah,
when he leans on that fucker,

892
00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:58.830
maybe he'll fall backwards and smack his head off that all weather carpet,

893
00:52:59.310 --> 00:53:04.310
you know that has a very thin layer of padding and then it's concrete and then

894
00:53:05.041 --> 00:53:08.040
you can act like you're concerned.
I don't know what happened.

895
00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.450
And as people sit there,

896
00:53:09.451 --> 00:53:12.840
you know freaking out because the guy's eating his tongue at that point in the

897
00:53:12.841 --> 00:53:15.450
middle of a fucking seizure.
You just,
you know,

898
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:20.550
subtly re tighten the bolts.
So then it looks like a,

899
00:53:20.580 --> 00:53:24.720
maybe there's,
you know,
there is no evidence of why this guy just fell over.

900
00:53:24.721 --> 00:53:29.280
Maybe has health problems,
at which point his health insurance,

901
00:53:29.281 --> 00:53:30.450
they're going to fucking drop him.

902
00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:34.740
He'll then be seen as unstable by the company and guess what?

903
00:53:34.860 --> 00:53:38.340
His fucking office is going to open up.
All right?

904
00:53:38.341 --> 00:53:41.610
That's how you get a fucking office nowadays in corporate America.
Okay?

905
00:53:41.611 --> 00:53:45.060
You think you're going to sit there with your nose to the fucking spreadsheets,

906
00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:49.690
you know,
doing all that actuary horseshit,

907
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:54.270
trying to figure out how long the average person's prostate.

908
00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:58.230
I don't fucking,
whatever the fuck you guys do out there,

909
00:53:58.500 --> 00:54:02.010
if you live in Nebraska and your forehead and fleet from a fucking court field,

910
00:54:02.011 --> 00:54:06.810
you have an average lifespan of 67.8 years.
Nobody cares.

911
00:54:08.690 --> 00:54:10.950
You're actually amazed me about that shit.
That's somebody's passion,

912
00:54:11.910 --> 00:54:14.040
like just sitting like the way I love comedy.

913
00:54:14.850 --> 00:54:17.730
You know the way a serial killer loves murder.

914
00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.000
There's somebody out there sitting in a cubicle just looking at figures and just

915
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.670
seriously has a song in their heart.
You know,

916
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:31.730
a little bit of Christmas in their eyes as they try to figure out how long the

917
00:54:32.011 --> 00:54:34.320
average person in Japan is going to live.

918
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:37.950
Now that there's radioactivity in the ocean.
You know,

919
00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:43.200
they want to get there first to predict the the death day of somebody over
there.

920
00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.200
I've got to met do that shit that's going on over there in Japan.

921
00:54:46.201 --> 00:54:49.050
I told you about that last week,
but that's just fucking freak me out.

922
00:54:49.051 --> 00:54:53.160
Those poor people over there.
Uh,
you know,
and I'm telling you,

923
00:54:53.161 --> 00:54:57.180
I considering I don't go to the Catholic church anymore.

924
00:54:57.181 --> 00:55:00.360
I am going to start going to the church.
You'll fucking Ted Nugent.

925
00:55:00.930 --> 00:55:04.230
I'm not going to start referring to myself as uncle bill and feel like as though

926
00:55:04.231 --> 00:55:06.510
I'm rebelling against something.
But I definitely,

927
00:55:07.230 --> 00:55:09.630
I definitely think I need to secure my perimeter.

928
00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.640
Do you know my girl won't let me get a fucking water bubbler water bubbler,

929
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:20.400
not one of a water cooler.
She just won't let me do it.
She's,

930
00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:25.170
she's such a fucking broad.
I'm sitting there,

931
00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:29.040
we're watching the disaster unfolding over there in Japan.

932
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:33.000
Go and look at these poor people.
They live on a fault line.
Just like us.

933
00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:35.730
Look at the panic and fucking confusion.

934
00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:40.260
When you take the average person who doesn't know how to live outside and you

935
00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:44.370
force them to live outside,
they're walking around,
you know,

936
00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:48.960
without a laptop and a cell phone.
Probably for the first time,

937
00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:52.410
I'd say in 15 years.
But that's more American.

938
00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:56.190
We're talking Japan here probably for the first time in 30 years over there,

939
00:55:56.730 --> 00:56:00.300
you know,
with their fucking advancements.
And it's just like,

940
00:56:00.301 --> 00:56:02.880
I'm looking at them like,
okay,
now first thing you fucking want,

941
00:56:04.530 --> 00:56:08.880
you want some water?
We can go 30 30 days without food,
right?

942
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:12.690
But water,
you can only go three days.
So here I am going,
you know,

943
00:56:12.691 --> 00:56:14.340
we got a couple of fucking,
you know,

944
00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:18.780
gallon jugs of Arrowhead in a,

945
00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:22.020
that's not an advertisement.
There's nowhere advertisement on this podcast yet.

946
00:56:22.200 --> 00:56:25.420
Okay.
But am suddenly throwing it out there to arrowhead.

947
00:56:25.710 --> 00:56:28.780
Let me just start mentioning products on my podcast.
You know,

948
00:56:28.810 --> 00:56:31.720
I'm sitting here in my craftmatic adjustable bed.

949
00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:39.520
Jodi's totally whoring himself out to fucking podcast sucks now.
Wow.

950
00:56:39.550 --> 00:56:40.383
Fucking put your,

951
00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.410
you put your fucking head down in your plastic desk right now.
All right.

952
00:56:46.890 --> 00:56:51.340
Right there.
Fucking staples shut your face.
Anyways,
so we got,
uh,

953
00:56:51.400 --> 00:56:56.110
we are like two gallons a fucking water in our refrigerator and that's it.
Okay.

954
00:56:56.111 --> 00:57:01.030
Those coolers,
man,
he got,
he got five gallon jugs.
So you get two of those.

955
00:57:01.031 --> 00:57:06.010
You always have about,
you know,
roughly at least five gallons of water anywhere,

956
00:57:06.011 --> 00:57:09.550
all the way up to like seven to nine.
Who the fuck knows,
right?

957
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:13.240
Or maybe you get lucky,
the earthquake hits when you got two full ones,

958
00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.340
and then when everybody around you is dying a fucking thirsty and you're sitting

959
00:57:18.341 --> 00:57:21.940
in there,
it's just sipping your water.
You know,

960
00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:23.890
sipping your water,

961
00:57:23.891 --> 00:57:27.910
running your hands through your gold coins with your fucking nine millimeter

962
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:31.960
between your fucking legs,
you're gonna,
you're gonna feel,
okay.

963
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:36.730
See,
that's how Americans look at a disaster.
It's not,

964
00:57:36.731 --> 00:57:40.570
let's all get together and try to fight through this.
I told you last week,

965
00:57:40.571 --> 00:57:43.660
it's gangs in New York over here.
All right?

966
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.930
English people before you get on your fucking high horse.

967
00:57:46.931 --> 00:57:50.140
If there was a fucking giant earthquake that affected all of Europe,

968
00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.270
you you're going to get,
you're going to help the French people out.

969
00:57:52.930 --> 00:57:55.330
You're going to help out the Krauts,
Huh?

970
00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.840
All those guys there with their wooden shoes over there in Holland.

971
00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:04.750
Fucking tap dancing along with a fucking cow or some shit.

972
00:58:04.751 --> 00:58:09.700
Whatever they do over there smoking weed,
you're not going to help out.

973
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:14.170
You're not all right.
It's a shut your faces.
Anyways,

974
00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.210
so this is what I'm talking about.

975
00:58:16.930 --> 00:58:21.010
I'm talking about preparing yourself for a fucking disaster.
All right,

976
00:58:21.011 --> 00:58:22.630
and what is my girl concerned about?

977
00:58:22.631 --> 00:58:26.560
I just don't know where we're going to put it.
It just,

978
00:58:26.561 --> 00:58:31.120
you need to measure it first.
We can't put it over there.

979
00:58:31.121 --> 00:58:33.010
That doggie dishes there.

980
00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:38.260
The doggie dish is going to float out the fucking windows,
you know?

981
00:58:38.890 --> 00:58:41.440
No wait,
we're up on the second floor in and the hill.

982
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:45.490
We're on in the hill on a hill.
Right?
We're going to be fine.

983
00:58:45.580 --> 00:58:49.660
I'm further enough away from the fucking ocean.
I'll tell you,

984
00:58:49.661 --> 00:58:52.480
if a tsunami hits me,
where the fuck I'm at,
I don't want to live.

985
00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:57.250
You know what I mean?
Kevin Costner,
the real Kevin Costner,

986
00:58:57.400 --> 00:59:01.220
not even him playing his character in waterworld though real Kevin Costner will

987
00:59:01.221 --> 00:59:04.060
probably float out of the Hollywood hills right past me.

988
00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:07.810
That's when I take out my nine millimeter and I fucking aim it right at his

989
00:59:07.811 --> 00:59:11.050
receding hairline.
You know,
I should fucking talk right.

990
00:59:11.051 --> 00:59:15.700
And I just fucking blow his brains out and I take as little raft,
you know,

991
00:59:15.701 --> 00:59:18.790
there's gonna be some half dress hot,
hot little horror on,
on,
on the,

992
00:59:18.791 --> 00:59:19.960
on the RAF too.
Right.

993
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:26.430
Can't have a fucking disaster movie unless there's a scantily clad whore in the

994
00:59:26.931 --> 00:59:30.380
middle of it.
Um,
so anyways,
yeah,
that's what the fuck she's all about.

995
00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.780
That's what the fuck she's all about.

996
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:35.630
She doesn't know where we're going to put it.
And I'm sitting there going,
well,

997
00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:35.991
you know,

998
00:59:35.991 --> 00:59:40.160
I could break down some of the shit in my office and she's just like water

999
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:45.290
bubbler,
water cooler and an office that just,
you know,

1000
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:49.640
I was watching that fat con to went to jail for the stock shit the other day.

1001
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:54.200
I can,
I never remember her name.
And uh,
what does it Mandy?

1002
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.790
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

1003
00:59:55.790 --> 01:00:00.040
<v 4>she got that Goddamn bowl cut.
I know.
I know.
This one.
I'm going to scream it.</v>

1004
01:00:00.070 --> 01:00:03.030
I'm gonna tell you right now,
later on the podcast,
when I'm not thinking about,

1005
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:06.720
I'm going to remember it.
I can't fucking her.

1006
01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:10.700
I keep thinking Rhonda Shear.
I know it's not that.
What is your,

1007
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:13.820
what is the name of the chick who fucking shows you how to make a pie,

1008
01:00:13.821 --> 01:00:15.950
but for some reason doesn't do it.
She goes,

1009
01:00:15.951 --> 01:00:17.780
this is how you make the perfect Pumpkin Pie.

1010
01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:21.080
And then she calls in some immigrant to do it for on a cooking show.

1011
01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.160
How I keep having it.

1012
01:00:25.550 --> 01:00:29.180
Why don't we keep thinking Madeline?
She said,
fucking chick from Connecticut,

1013
01:00:29.181 --> 01:00:33.650
self made woman.
I respect her,
you know,
I feel bad for her.
She was

1014
01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.600
the Oswald of Wall Street.
She was the patsy.
She's the one who went down.

1015
01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:41.480
They didn't get any of the bankers.
They just got her right knee.

1016
01:00:41.481 --> 01:00:44.090
She gets her pubes highlighted.
Do you think she has that kind of money?

1017
01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:50.260
Martha Stewart.
Bam.
I got it.
Um,
you know,

1018
01:00:50.261 --> 01:00:54.610
you'd be having some money when you get your pubes died baby.
Y'All ready?

1019
01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:56.860
Next for this next motherfucker.
Come onto the stage.

1020
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:58.850
This mother fucker represent and day say,

1021
01:01:00.250 --> 01:01:04.420
I'm sorry I had a flash back to some old shows.
Uh,
anyways.
Hey,

1022
01:01:04.421 --> 01:01:08.420
speaking of survival.
Okay.
I drive a Prius.

1023
01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:11.530
Hi.
You don't?
So you know what I love?
Yeah,

1024
01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:15.300
about the Prius is it's not the gay his car on the road anymore because Nissan

1025
01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:19.410
has come out with an all electric car called the leaf.
Okay.

1026
01:01:19.411 --> 01:01:23.190
I challenge you to come up with a gay or name for a car.
All right?

1027
01:01:23.191 --> 01:01:27.230
And I'm not attacking the fucking homosexual solve are there.
All right.

1028
01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:29.250
As far as I can tell,

1029
01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:32.190
there's a lot of gay guys that could kick the living shit out of me and have

1030
01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:32.940
their way with me.

1031
01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:37.940
So the last thing I want to do is make someone mad at me who oddly may want to

1032
01:01:38.770 --> 01:01:39.603
fuck.

1033
01:01:42.750 --> 01:01:45.990
I'm just saying it's gay as in it's fucking lane.
Okay.

1034
01:01:46.470 --> 01:01:50.280
And all you fucking gay people can go fuck yourselves.
All right.

1035
01:01:50.310 --> 01:01:53.220
That's what words do.
They morph into other shit.

1036
01:01:53.370 --> 01:01:58.190
Gay used to make me really happy.
The gay nineties,
the 1890s,

1037
01:01:58.310 --> 01:01:59.430
were known as the gay nineties.

1038
01:01:59.431 --> 01:02:03.960
That didn't mean there was a bunch of guys out there blowing each other.
Right.

1039
01:02:04.290 --> 01:02:07.500
Just met.
Everybody was happy.
They were happy and gay.

1040
01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:11.040
This isn't the gay and that old anxiety song.
The New Year Song,

1041
01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.140
they all acquaintance be forgot it.
[inaudible] okay,

1042
01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:20.460
Eh,
let y'all be gay.
Right.
Something like one of those fucking songs.

1043
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:26.580
Uh,
in the birthday song,
the word gay is in something.
I don't know what it is.

1044
01:02:26.581 --> 01:02:29.490
It's a song that I hear like once a year and I'm like,
yeah,
that's funny.

1045
01:02:29.491 --> 01:02:31.740
That gay used to mean happy.
Now it means,
uh,

1046
01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:36.300
you want to dive on your girlfriend's muff
whilst you,

1047
01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:40.800
you have a muff yourself.
You know?
Isn't that kind of just greedy?

1048
01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:46.710
You know,
it's sort of the biggest loser of sexuality to be gay.

1049
01:02:47.100 --> 01:02:49.740
You know,
I have a dick.
Oh I kicked you.
One's not enough.

1050
01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:54.600
You're selfish conti guy to go have another one.
Jesus Christ.

1051
01:02:54.601 --> 01:02:59.250
He's fucking gluttonous gay people.
Um,
this is why I do the park.

1052
01:02:59.251 --> 01:03:02.190
I try to do a fucking podcast last night and it sucked.

1053
01:03:02.490 --> 01:03:05.820
I need a good night's sleep before I do a podcast cause I was driving out from

1054
01:03:05.821 --> 01:03:10.800
the desert.
Uh,
cause my buddy had a,
a,
you know,
his wife had a baby,

1055
01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:13.550
a beautiful,
beautiful fucking baby girls.

1056
01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:15.960
And as it's such a relief when you show up in the baby's gorgeous.

1057
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:19.440
Isn't it such a fucking relief,
you know,
cause some of them when they come out,

1058
01:03:19.441 --> 01:03:24.120
obviously they're like a little bit early or they're a little weird look in

1059
01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:28.680
their fucking head hasn't fused together yet.
Right.
And they look like,
uh,

1060
01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:34.200
they look like an octopus.
Some of them,
if you chopped off four of its arms,

1061
01:03:36.750 --> 01:03:40.920
actually six of its arms and then you put two legs in place of the two arms.

1062
01:03:41.490 --> 01:03:45.600
Right bill,
we get it.
We can do basic math.
Yeah.
You don't have,

1063
01:03:45.601 --> 01:03:49.950
it's got those little octopus heads and you've got to sit there.
Hey,
wow,

1064
01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:52.590
look at that,
eh?
Yeah.
Why don't you,

1065
01:03:52.591 --> 01:03:55.080
is there any way you can stick it back in front of the a couple of weeks,

1066
01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.950
you know,
von things you've attacked in your podcast.

1067
01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:03.450
I draw the line at babies still.
Yeah.
Why do you draw the line of babies?
Huh?

1068
01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.390
Cause you can feel it kicking in your womb.

1069
01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:12.090
I am really just being crass on this one.
Um,
who gives a shit?

1070
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:16.950
How far into this podcast are we are 13 minutes halfway through the first period

1071
01:04:17.910 --> 01:04:18.590
over halfway.

1072
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:21.690
Speaking of how that you guys see the Bruins Bruins made the earth just clinch a

1073
01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:23.760
playoff berth by finally beaten.

1074
01:04:23.761 --> 01:04:28.470
The fly is the time I watch a Bruins flyers game.

1075
01:04:28.471 --> 01:04:30.300
They lose unless it's a playoff series.

1076
01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.080
Then they just when the first three and then lose the next fucking four.

1077
01:04:34.590 --> 01:04:38.520
But as the first time I watched a Bruins flyers game in a long time and uh,

1078
01:04:38.521 --> 01:04:43.521
they actually want to Goddamn damn good team flyers have and the fucking rangers

1079
01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:48.960
scare the shit out of me with Henrik lundqvist mother fucker stop and
everything.

1080
01:04:48.961 --> 01:04:53.520
But I think Tim Thomas is a better goalie.
Um,
and I think we know something.

1081
01:04:53.521 --> 01:04:57.870
We've oddly adjusted very well.
Uh,

1082
01:04:57.871 --> 01:05:02.130
once we traded all Douche face there and he does ever Douche face.

1083
01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.293
Phil Kessel,

1084
01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:07.800
you guys watching the NHL network where for some reason when they say NHL
hockey,

1085
01:05:07.801 --> 01:05:11.250
they have to tap.
The guys do these stupid dramatic,
like they'll,

1086
01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:16.200
they're not facing the camera and then they turn around and they're all sweaty

1087
01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:19.360
and they this look on their face,
not happy,
not sad,

1088
01:05:19.361 --> 01:05:22.990
just sort of staring intensely at the,
it's like I get it.
It's hockey.

1089
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.950
It's an intense sport.
You know,
the guy couldn't towel off before this.

1090
01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.530
Is he sweating from being under the lights?

1091
01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.670
Am I really supposed to believe that he just skated over to the bench and you

1092
01:05:33.671 --> 01:05:37.810
were able to black out the entire arena?
Now he's staring at you.
Well,

1093
01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:41.830
some of them look cool,
some of them look intimidated and some of them look okay.

1094
01:05:41.831 --> 01:05:44.110
But Phil Kessel,
he just looks like a Douche bag.

1095
01:05:44.111 --> 01:05:46.300
I don't understand it cause he's a fucking great player.

1096
01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:51.480
But you see his puffy baby fat cheeks when he turns around and he just looks

1097
01:05:51.851 --> 01:05:55.810
like the kid that you would cross check even if his fucking parents were

1098
01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.490
standing on the side.
You know,

1099
01:05:57.491 --> 01:06:01.090
if you play like street hockey then you try to play it off.
Oh I'm sorry.

1100
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:02.650
And is he cried?

1101
01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:07.810
It would make you have a nice feeling right in your heart.
You know,
my,

1102
01:06:07.811 --> 01:06:12.490
the only psycho like that
wasn't there always one kid in your neighborhood.

1103
01:06:12.491 --> 01:06:15.190
You just love to see cry,
you know?

1104
01:06:15.191 --> 01:06:19.630
And was there anything better that when somebody else did it and you didn't do

1105
01:06:19.631 --> 01:06:19.811
it,

1106
01:06:19.811 --> 01:06:24.760
so you could actually sit there and laugh and enjoy the kid crying and he didn't

1107
01:06:24.761 --> 01:06:27.550
have to run away when his parents came running out of the house.

1108
01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:31.240
Does that scenario even exist anymore with you fucking

1109
01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:35.890
this new generation of fucking cons out there.

1110
01:06:36.190 --> 01:06:40.300
Who spent their entire childhood inside on the Internet and playing fucking

1111
01:06:40.301 --> 01:06:42.100
video games.
You missed out,

1112
01:06:43.330 --> 01:06:46.480
you missed out back in the day when you used to play outside.

1113
01:06:46.690 --> 01:06:50.920
There was always one kid and he was fat or he was fucking weird looking.

1114
01:06:51.190 --> 01:06:55.030
So what you did was you picked on him unless he was funny,

1115
01:06:55.750 --> 01:07:00.160
he realized,
okay,
I gotta be funny.
You know,
Kinda like make when I was a kid,

1116
01:07:00.161 --> 01:07:04.630
I look like opie with a little bit of Ralph mouth and I realized,

1117
01:07:04.631 --> 01:07:06.400
I realized it.
I'm like,
wow,

1118
01:07:06.730 --> 01:07:10.450
I'm the only one who has this fucking hair color in my neighborhood.

1119
01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.550
I look like a fucking freak.
I bet.
I bet it.

1120
01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.760
Start fucking comment with the jokes here.
I did.
That's what I did.
I used to go,

1121
01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:20.920
got sign a little Tuxedo and I would just start,
hey,

1122
01:07:20.921 --> 01:07:22.320
interesting happen thing happened to me,

1123
01:07:22.321 --> 01:07:24.340
a the middle of getting potty trained or whatever.

1124
01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:27.490
I wish I would have jokes because uh,
yeah,

1125
01:07:27.491 --> 01:07:30.480
I used to get the shit kicked out of me.
What do you think that Kik had?

1126
01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:34.540
Ginger days.
It's something new.
I think we always haven't been picked on.
Um,

1127
01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:39.220
anyways,
what the fuck am I talking about here?
Oh,
that's something that I get,

1128
01:07:39.221 --> 01:07:42.100
I've gotten a lot lately from people.

1129
01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.410
People think I don't understand the Internet,

1130
01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:49.430
which I think is absolutely hilarious.
Like there's something to get it Kinda,

1131
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:53.860
it is what it is,
you know what I mean?
It's like how don't I get it?

1132
01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:58.970
Huh?
Cause I call you out when you do dumb shit.
You know,
I,

1133
01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.660
I was on the Joe Rogan podcast,
uh,

1134
01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.690
this past week and a fucking amazing podcast.

1135
01:08:06.691 --> 01:08:09.880
I go there and Joe's like,
do you know whatever time you want to come over,

1136
01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:12.790
blah blah blah,
blah blah blah.
And I said all right,
why don't we say 12 noon?

1137
01:08:13.870 --> 01:08:17.390
Cause I don't want to get stuck in rush with basically how it works out here in

1138
01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:17.740
La.

1139
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:21.530
As you got to schedule everything between between 10 and two in the afternoon.

1140
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:25.220
That anytime I haven't been,
when do you want to meet between 10 and two.

1141
01:08:25.690 --> 01:08:26.523
All right,

1142
01:08:27.530 --> 01:08:31.760
buddy of mind Al Madrigal hilarious comedian.
Definitely check them out.

1143
01:08:31.790 --> 01:08:34.280
Al Madrigal,
he's the one who he told me to do that.

1144
01:08:35.060 --> 01:08:36.950
So I go 10 between 10 and two.
Now.

1145
01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:39.770
I'm not going to go there at 10 in the fucking morning.
I said,
all right,

1146
01:08:39.771 --> 01:08:43.700
I'll go there at 12 noon.
So I'll do 12 noon.
I'll get out of there two,

1147
01:08:43.701 --> 01:08:46.340
two 30 I'll avoid rush hour traffic.
Right.

1148
01:08:46.970 --> 01:08:50.330
And His fucking podcast is so much fun.
I think we did like a three and a half,

1149
01:08:50.331 --> 01:08:54.440
four hour fucking podcast,
you know,
took us like a half an hour to settle in.

1150
01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:58.250
So we started at 1230,
you know,

1151
01:08:58.580 --> 01:09:01.730
he gave me this coconut water that was so fucking delicious.

1152
01:09:01.731 --> 01:09:05.930
I actually came home and immediately went on to Amazon in order to fucking case

1153
01:09:05.931 --> 01:09:09.590
of it.
12 pack is what I got.
You know,
alligator armed it.

1154
01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.940
Um,
now cause I didn't want to get a case,

1155
01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:16.370
I just wouldn't want to deal with my girlfriend going first,

1156
01:09:16.371 --> 01:09:20.120
a water cooler and now a case of coconut water.

1157
01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.680
Where are we going to put this?
Theorial I didn't want to deal with that.

1158
01:09:24.681 --> 01:09:28.490
So I only got the fucking 12 pack.
All right.
So anyways,

1159
01:09:29.150 --> 01:09:31.310
we start the podcast and we just have a great time.

1160
01:09:31.311 --> 01:09:32.450
Fucking went through the whole thing.

1161
01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:36.020
I definitely suggest you listen to what I of course don't have the link because

1162
01:09:36.021 --> 01:09:38.820
I'm an asshole,
but just look up Joe Rogan podcasts.

1163
01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.980
If he gets like 250,000 hits a week,
um,
so you'll definitely be able to hear it.

1164
01:09:43.010 --> 01:09:47.750
But in the end of the podcast,
I got into this huge fucking argument with his,
uh,

1165
01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:51.560
with his male assistant,
a tech guy,

1166
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:55.380
whatever the fuck you call them.
The Guy who sits there and uh,
you know,

1167
01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:59.600
was constantly adjusting knobs on the mixer.
Um,

1168
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:06.110
we got a stupid fucking argument about whether or not someone had the right to

1169
01:10:06.111 --> 01:10:10.220
take my podcast,
put it on a website that had advertising on it.

1170
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:16.070
And I basically said they didn't,
you could,
you know,
I put my podcast out there,

1171
01:10:16.071 --> 01:10:20.300
it is free,
but it's still my intellectual property.
I give it away for free.

1172
01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:24.410
So you take it for free,
you can't take it and then start making money off it.

1173
01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:29.330
And there was a website that was,
had all these podcasts and they will,

1174
01:10:29.390 --> 01:10:31.490
they,
you know,
they got them all on one website,

1175
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:35.390
hence a ton of people went to the website.
Why?

1176
01:10:35.570 --> 01:10:38.540
Because of the creation of the artists.

1177
01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:41.270
Their intellectual property was getting hits.

1178
01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:44.810
No one was going to the website to look at the fucking website with nothing on

1179
01:10:44.811 --> 01:10:48.880
it.
They were going there to listen to the podcast and on their homepage they had

1180
01:10:48.900 --> 01:10:51.410
advertising.
So all these podcasts,

1181
01:10:51.530 --> 01:10:56.510
we're getting eyeballs to go to the fucking website,
all right?

1182
01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.960
And they go there and they read advertising.

1183
01:10:59.961 --> 01:11:02.990
And that's how you sell advertising by the amount of fucking people you get to

1184
01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:06.650
your website.
So how you're supposed to do that,

1185
01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:11.420
you're supposed to contact the artists or the owner of the work and say,

1186
01:11:11.421 --> 01:11:16.140
listen,
we want to use this shit.
We're going to be selling advertising.
All right,

1187
01:11:16.710 --> 01:11:19.050
we'll take our cut.
You take your cut,
that's fine.

1188
01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:20.280
That's what the fuck you supposed to do.

1189
01:11:20.281 --> 01:11:23.940
You can't just take it and put it on your site and start making money off of it.

1190
01:11:23.941 --> 01:11:28.260
And for some reason he was saying it was my fault because technology existed for

1191
01:11:28.261 --> 01:11:30.630
them to do that.
It's hilarious.

1192
01:11:30.631 --> 01:11:35.220
He completely ignored all the laws of intellectual property,
copyright laws,

1193
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:40.200
fuck all that.
You know,
it's like,
you know,
if you steal somebody's car,

1194
01:11:40.201 --> 01:11:43.450
that's grand theft auto.
But if you go out and you go buy one of,

1195
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:45.810
what do they call those?
Those little Jimmy things,
those slim Jims,

1196
01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:48.210
we can unlock the door to your car.
You know,

1197
01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.240
if you have one of those that you know,
it's not stealing,

1198
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.400
it's the dumbest.

1199
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:56.430
It was the stupidest fucking argument I've ever gotten into in my life.

1200
01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:01.620
I'm arguing what the actual law is,
and this guy is talking about technology,

1201
01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.120
but technology exists for me to do something illegal.

1202
01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:10.590
Therefore it's not illegal,
was fucking retarded.

1203
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:14.460
And the only thing more retarded was the fact that I couldn't fucking tap out of

1204
01:12:14.461 --> 01:12:16.980
the argument.
I can't believe I never brought up.
Well Dude,

1205
01:12:16.981 --> 01:12:21.981
I actually called my lawyer who went to law school in majors in it with a focus

1206
01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:26.370
in entertainment law.
And not only did he tell me I was 100% right.

1207
01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:29.460
He actually said I could sue that website if I want it to,

1208
01:12:29.461 --> 01:12:32.010
which I'm not going to,
but that's how right I was.

1209
01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:35.280
Jesus fucking Christ.

1210
01:12:35.281 --> 01:12:40.281
I mean a laptop exists that's legal to buy in a laptop and with the technology

1211
01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:42.180
of a laptop and a little bit of smarts,

1212
01:12:42.181 --> 01:12:45.510
I can break into your online bank account and take all your fucking money.

1213
01:12:45.870 --> 01:12:50.310
Does it mean it's,
it's not illegal because laptops are illegal and I don't.

1214
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:52.080
It was the dumbest fucking argument ever.

1215
01:12:52.170 --> 01:12:57.170
And it lasted for 45 minutes and of course it got a zillion hits.

1216
01:12:57.541 --> 01:13:01.770
Joe was telling me it got the most fucking responses.
All right,

1217
01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:06.030
and you're can sit there and tell me,
I don't get the Internet.
I get it.
I get it.

1218
01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:08.220
People like arguments,

1219
01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:13.170
they like arguments and they like stealing shit and not get in,
you know,

1220
01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:17.970
and not fucking paying for stuff and then acting like they don't understand what

1221
01:13:17.971 --> 01:13:19.440
you're talking about.
Goes right back to that.

1222
01:13:19.890 --> 01:13:22.020
All that stealing music that everybody did.

1223
01:13:22.021 --> 01:13:25.140
Remember that shit and all the artists got mad going,

1224
01:13:25.260 --> 01:13:26.810
you're stealing our music in every cycle.

1225
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:30.360
We not steel in hit man was sharing files.

1226
01:13:32.490 --> 01:13:35.970
Now we were stealing it.
Look what we did.

1227
01:13:37.260 --> 01:13:41.070
We destroyed and I say we because I was on why

1228
01:13:42.990 --> 01:13:47.400
I was on limewire for a good eight months before someone finally was just like,

1229
01:13:47.401 --> 01:13:48.360
dude,
we're stealing music.

1230
01:13:48.361 --> 01:13:50.940
How could we do that then that someone can steal your fucking comedy.

1231
01:13:50.941 --> 01:13:53.460
This is bullshit.
I know a lot of you right now sitting there go,

1232
01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:54.181
well there you go.

1233
01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:57.960
You stole music gear for someone ought to be able to steal your fucking podcast.

1234
01:13:57.961 --> 01:14:01.890
Who fucking advert now two wrongs don't make a right.
Okay.

1235
01:14:01.891 --> 01:14:04.920
Just cause I go out and murder somebody doesn't mean someone can come over and

1236
01:14:04.921 --> 01:14:09.630
murder somebody.
I know we're both going to get charged with murder.
All right.

1237
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:13.960
I didn't say it was a perfect person to this people and I think it shows what a

1238
01:14:13.961 --> 01:14:16.840
big person I am that I can admit to some my wrong doings in the past.

1239
01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:20.770
But anyways,
after fucking 10 years is still a music look,

1240
01:14:20.771 --> 01:14:24.100
look at the music business.
Okay.
It's over.

1241
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:28.590
It's fucking over.
Steven Tyler is on,
on,
uh,

1242
01:14:28.610 --> 01:14:33.100
American idol talking to people who work at a fucking Cinnabon telling them that

1243
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.720
they have good voices and that they have,

1244
01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:38.260
they're going to have some sort of career in,
in,
in a,
in a fucking

1245
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:44.170
art that where the whole business model has been completely fucking destroyed.

1246
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:47.140
You guys haven't noticed that shit.

1247
01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:51.010
Musicians are like in movies now.

1248
01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:52.870
They're doing everything but segging I saw there's a,

1249
01:14:52.871 --> 01:14:56.140
there's a new show out where Christina Aguilar is a judge.

1250
01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:59.740
The lead singer of Maroon five is a judge.
Some country singers,
a judge,

1251
01:14:59.890 --> 01:15:04.360
all these guys who Kook,
who used to be able to sell out the staple center.

1252
01:15:04.361 --> 01:15:08.920
It's the whole fucking thing.
It's over.
So,
uh,
I dunno.

1253
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.790
Did that even make sense?
I don't even know what the fuck my point was.

1254
01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:16.390
I can't sell at the staples center.
All right.
Go fuck yourselves.

1255
01:15:16.391 --> 01:15:20.080
But I was right in that argument.
And,
uh,
I actually,
I had a great

1256
01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:25.720
time this week because I didn't read one of the emails that were sent to me

1257
01:15:25.721 --> 01:15:29.110
about that stupid argument.
I would just see it,
Joe Rogan's podcast,

1258
01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:32.980
a RSS feed,
any of that shit.

1259
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:35.680
I just deleted all of them and it was fucking was fantastic.

1260
01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.660
Absolutely fantastic.

1261
01:15:37.661 --> 01:15:42.250
So I didn't have to read the in argue with strangers who don't understand the

1262
01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:45.130
laws.
So there you go.
I hope as some of that may,
you know,

1263
01:15:45.131 --> 01:15:46.630
I realized halfway through that is none of you,

1264
01:15:46.690 --> 01:15:48.520
most of you probably didn't even hear the fucking argument,

1265
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:52.120
but you'll probably go to Joe Rogan's podcast to listen to it.

1266
01:15:52.121 --> 01:15:56.380
Won't Ya see that look at me spreading the podcast love.

1267
01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.360
Um,
all right.
With that,
with that running of the fucking mouth,

1268
01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:06.150
what do I have coming up here?
People this week I'm actually going to be,
um,

1269
01:16:07.810 --> 01:16:11.350
where am I going to be?
I'm in town this week.
I'm actually working on April 2nd.

1270
01:16:12.460 --> 01:16:15.610
I let me get the exact date here in case I screw this up to the name of the
show.

1271
01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:18.700
It was Kevin and beans,
April foolishness show.

1272
01:16:19.150 --> 01:16:22.540
They do it at the Gibson Hampi theater.
I did it last year and had,
yeah,

1273
01:16:22.570 --> 01:16:27.570
April 2nd I had an unbelievably great time and I'm absolutely love doing doing

1274
01:16:30.551 --> 01:16:34.660
this gig because not only do I get to work with a bunch of comedians that I

1275
01:16:34.661 --> 01:16:38.350
never get to see anymore,
it's all a bunch of headliners.

1276
01:16:39.230 --> 01:16:41.680
But as far as the fucking I can see,

1277
01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.890
of course I don't have any of the fucking names.
Who the hell's on at Patton?

1278
01:16:44.891 --> 01:16:49.660
Oswalt's on it.
Jimmy Kimmel's on it.
I'm on it.

1279
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:52.990
Kevin and beads.
I forget.
I can't remember what the lineup is.
Fucking real.

1280
01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.310
I think Dana Gould might be on it.

1281
01:16:54.311 --> 01:16:56.980
I shouldn't name names here cause I don't know.
It's going to be awesome.

1282
01:16:56.981 --> 01:17:00.850
All these guys that I love watching them work are going to be on it.
And a,

1283
01:17:00.851 --> 01:17:01.630
and on top of that,

1284
01:17:01.630 --> 01:17:05.770
the Gipsy Gibson Hampi theater is used to be called the universal Hampi theater.

1285
01:17:06.340 --> 01:17:09.410
And that's the one where the blues brothers,
they,

1286
01:17:09.411 --> 01:17:12.470
when they recorded a briefcase full of blues with my favorite,

1287
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:16.250
one of my favorite drummers of all time,
Steve Jordan.
Uh,

1288
01:17:16.251 --> 01:17:18.260
that's where they did it right there on that stage.

1289
01:17:18.410 --> 01:17:21.920
And they were opening for Steve Martin back when he wore the white suit with the

1290
01:17:21.921 --> 01:17:25.190
fucking Arrow through his head.
I'm a geek for that type of shit.

1291
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.050
Theater history.

1292
01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:32.320
I always try to find out and I sit there really Charlie Chaplin play played

1293
01:17:32.391 --> 01:17:37.370
here,
Buster Keaton like that dumb shit,
you know.
Um,
so anyways,

1294
01:17:37.371 --> 01:17:42.050
I'll be doing that on April 2nd and then,
uh,
what else do I got?

1295
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:46.640
Oh,
I'm going to be in Maryland at the record theater for two shows on April 8th.

1296
01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:51.620
And then I'm going to be at the tower theater in Philadelphia,

1297
01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.320
Pennsylvania on April 9th.

1298
01:17:55.430 --> 01:17:57.680
And then later on that month I'm hitting two cities.

1299
01:17:57.681 --> 01:18:01.960
I haven't done stand up ever or in a long time.
Milwaukee never been there.

1300
01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:06.230
You're going to be at the,
uh,
the,
the PAPP's theater in Milwaukee,
Wisconsin.

1301
01:18:06.231 --> 01:18:11.060
April 22nd.
On April 23rd,
I'll be at the Royal Oak Music Theater in Detroit,

1302
01:18:11.061 --> 01:18:13.700
Michigan.
I have not been there since I did,
uh,

1303
01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:18.050
the Chappelle show tour with Charlie Murphy and Donnell Rawlings.

1304
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:21.410
And I think we did that.
We did that one back in 2004.

1305
01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:24.980
So it's been seven years since I've been there.
So,
um,

1306
01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.740
so please come out to that.
And with that,

1307
01:18:27.741 --> 01:18:31.880
let's get on with the podcast questions for the week.
Where is it?
Oh,

1308
01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:36.140
did I doubt again?
Open the fucking thing.
Jesus Christ.
Bill,

1309
01:18:36.141 --> 01:18:40.880
you call yourself a radio host or a podcast host.
Is that,

1310
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:45.290
is that what you call me?
Uh,
is that what you call yourself,
Bill?
All right.

1311
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:49.790
Open.
Fuck.
What can I talk about here?

1312
01:18:49.820 --> 01:18:50.660
What can I talk about?

1313
01:18:50.661 --> 01:18:54.710
Can I talk about how the Bruins raped the Montreal Canadiens seven did nothing.

1314
01:18:54.711 --> 01:18:59.210
Did you guys see that fucking game?
Absolutely raped them.
And,
uh,

1315
01:18:59.211 --> 01:19:02.450
I got to tell you they deserved every fucking second of that cause there's still

1316
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:06.560
bitching about that.
So Dana Chara hit,
you know,

1317
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.520
he finished his fucking check.
The problem was,

1318
01:19:10.521 --> 01:19:14.480
is that they still have that fucking bored,
that,
that piece of glass right there.

1319
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.650
That's the problem.
The problem is the NHL has seen for years,

1320
01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.000
guys almost get their fucking heads taken off on that part of the ice.

1321
01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:25.940
What you should do is just somehow make that thing collapsible,

1322
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:28.240
move it away from the ice.
I don't know what the fuck to do,

1323
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:32.480
but there's got to be okay if I can have a car that has a collapsible front end

1324
01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:37.481
of the engine is designed to go underneath me rather than into my fucking torso.

1325
01:19:37.970 --> 01:19:40.970
There's no way the Nhl can't have that.

1326
01:19:41.780 --> 01:19:43.190
I'll put the clip on there by the way,

1327
01:19:43.191 --> 01:19:48.140
on the [inaudible] podcast.com so you guys can see,
um,
see that hit,

1328
01:19:49.100 --> 01:19:53.450
I mean it was brutal because the guy fractured one of his vertebraes and uh,

1329
01:19:53.451 --> 01:19:54.590
so I felt bad about that.

1330
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:57.290
But then they were talking about the severity of the guys concussion.

1331
01:19:57.770 --> 01:20:01.250
And it turns out the fucking Douche went to the movies like three days later

1332
01:20:01.251 --> 01:20:05.960
with this allegedly severe concussion.
Gotta love Mark Recky for calling him out.

1333
01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:09.850
He was actually taken heat off shower just saying.
Yeah.
You know,
I don't,

1334
01:20:09.851 --> 01:20:11.520
I think he exaggerated it.

1335
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:17.430
Oh awesome.
Is that he did that,
you know,

1336
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:20.610
already know and how fucking sensitive they are up there.

1337
01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:24.580
This so fucking sensitive up there in Montreal.
It's not like Toronto.

1338
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.660
Toronto's a fun Goddamn city.
Montreal,

1339
01:20:27.661 --> 01:20:30.420
some of the most beautiful women you ever going to see in your life,

1340
01:20:30.421 --> 01:20:33.270
but the men are just so fucking sensitive.

1341
01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:39.420
They actually have the police looking into that,
hit
somebody,

1342
01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:43.440
think about somebody got checked into the fucking boards.
Okay.

1343
01:20:43.530 --> 01:20:46.860
And unfortunately right where the glass starts,
you know,

1344
01:20:46.980 --> 01:20:48.900
or the glass in between the benches,
you know,

1345
01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:54.960
and that they want to like put one of the Bruins in jail for playing hockey.

1346
01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.620
You know,
I'll tell you,
it's funny,

1347
01:20:58.770 --> 01:21:03.240
is 10 years ago there weren't even been a penalty on that play.
Um,

1348
01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:07.950
anyways,
so this is the deal.
Um,
the new email.
If you want to send me an email,

1349
01:21:07.951 --> 01:21:12.480
if you want to send me more fucking emails about a agreeing or disagreeing with

1350
01:21:12.481 --> 01:21:16.500
my argument on Joe Rogan,
he sent it to
bill@themmpodcast.com.

1351
01:21:17.430 --> 01:21:20.580
Please send me your underrated overrated lists.
Your advice,

1352
01:21:20.581 --> 01:21:23.550
if you have any questions,
your stories of revenge.
You know,

1353
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:26.780
all the shit that we've been doing throughout the years here and asked.

1354
01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:30.360
Speaking of overrated,
underrated,
uh,

1355
01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:33.660
I got one here for you as far as something being overrated.
You know,

1356
01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:38.670
what's overrated is outlets.
You know,
you don't want the broads.

1357
01:21:38.671 --> 01:21:43.020
Get all excited.
We're going to the outlets they get in.
They got a fucking,

1358
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:44.790
what the hell do they shop at?

1359
01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:49.200
They got a Jordan Mash at JC penny in a file,

1360
01:21:49.201 --> 01:21:52.380
liens outlet to any of those stores still exist?

1361
01:21:52.381 --> 01:21:56.520
Or did Macy's just fucking buy up?
All of them.
Do you know,

1362
01:21:57.570 --> 01:22:00.630
whatever.
Whatever the fuck they buy,
you know,

1363
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:05.220
they got all those stores.
Oh my God,
it's going to be blah,
blah,
blah.

1364
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:07.080
See going there is a guy going,
all right,

1365
01:22:07.081 --> 01:22:09.030
well maybe this won't cost me as much fucking money.

1366
01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:12.900
What do you want a pair of shoes,
sweetie?
Hey,
let's go to the outlet.

1367
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:16.410
Sounds like a fucking,
you know,

1368
01:22:17.310 --> 01:22:20.220
sounds like a dream because when you really think about it,

1369
01:22:20.221 --> 01:22:24.450
it doesn't make any fucking sense.
Why is it so God damn cheap?

1370
01:22:25.710 --> 01:22:30.210
Why did they suddenly decide that they just didn't want to make as much money on

1371
01:22:30.211 --> 01:22:34.860
that shirt that that seven year olds so together in the Philippines as they

1372
01:22:34.861 --> 01:22:38.910
would in a mall?
What is it about the outlet?
You know,

1373
01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.130
if you use common sense,
you actually think,

1374
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:45.030
well they're probably not marking them down as much as they think that as they

1375
01:22:45.031 --> 01:22:49.380
say they are and it's probably a bunch of shit that nobody wanted a bunch of

1376
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:53.490
shit that didn't sell well at the malls and now they got to get fucking rid of

1377
01:22:53.491 --> 01:22:57.030
it.
Isn't that what it is?
That's where my experience,
you go to the,

1378
01:22:57.240 --> 01:22:59.160
they're overrated.
You go to an outlet.

1379
01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:02.340
And another thing that they like doing is they like to say that the,

1380
01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:06.520
the actual retail price is about 30 more than it usually is.

1381
01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:11.080
And then they give you a 2% discount and you feel like you're getting like 32%

1382
01:23:11.081 --> 01:23:15.580
off.
You know,
cause people suck at math.
They'll do Adidas shell toes,

1383
01:23:15.730 --> 01:23:19.480
usually
$126 now,

1384
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:24.010
only 68
you know,
what the fuck are they,

1385
01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:28.360
you know,
hundred and 68 or whatever to whatever the fucking number.

1386
01:23:28.361 --> 01:23:33.040
I just said the shell toes,
there's no arch support whatsoever.

1387
01:23:33.490 --> 01:23:37.660
It's the same fucking design that you've had for the last 40 fucking years.

1388
01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.000
So there's no,
there's no extra cost.

1389
01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.450
You don't have to hire somebody to design a new fucking sneaker.
Right.

1390
01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:47.140
It's like a goddamned Porsche.
It's the same fucking design forever.

1391
01:23:49.090 --> 01:23:51.430
So whatever.
So we go there and she goes in,

1392
01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:55.290
she goes into Prada and I walk in and it,
it,

1393
01:23:55.291 --> 01:23:57.700
it's still a fucking ridiculously expensive shoe.

1394
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:02.850
I got so fucking mad in my girl at that thing I was telling to saying,

1395
01:24:02.981 --> 01:24:07.150
listen,
listen,
we're going out to the desert.
My buddy had a kid.

1396
01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:09.790
It's his first kid.
I want to go out there and that that's,

1397
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:12.820
that's what it's supposed to be about.
But you know,
fucking women,

1398
01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.380
they can't just go out and go do stay.
Always got to get something.
Yeah.

1399
01:24:17.381 --> 01:24:21.280
If you notice that all you young studs out there banging away,
having one,

1400
01:24:21.281 --> 01:24:23.080
even if you have a one night stand with them,

1401
01:24:23.230 --> 01:24:25.000
they still try to get a tee shirt out of it.

1402
01:24:25.001 --> 01:24:26.830
Even notice that I can feel your teeth yet.

1403
01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:30.370
Then they just walk out with it and fucking weird.
They like,

1404
01:24:30.371 --> 01:24:33.250
they like serial killers.
I like,
they've taken some sort of a trophy,

1405
01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:36.910
make it a goddamn food doll.
Keep,
give me,
you know,
I was one of the,

1406
01:24:36.911 --> 01:24:40.960
that was one of the,
uh,
one of the turning points is me as a single guy,

1407
01:24:40.990 --> 01:24:44.770
when I asked for the tee shirt back,
I started doing it.
Can I am a t shirt back?

1408
01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:48.100
And I,
I loved it because they didn't know what,

1409
01:24:48.310 --> 01:24:52.180
because they were pissed that they asked for it,
that I asked for it.

1410
01:24:52.390 --> 01:24:56.290
But then they also didn't want to come off as some selfish cunt,

1411
01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.800
so then they had to take it up.
But Ah,

1412
01:24:57.940 --> 01:25:01.870
they're just [inaudible] the conflicting emotions on their face,

1413
01:25:01.871 --> 01:25:04.990
mad that you asked and then trying to play it off.
Like they're not mad.

1414
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:08.650
So you can see that they're actually a good girl who will jump on your Dick

1415
01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:13.120
after knowing you for about four and a half hours.
Right.
So anyways,

1416
01:25:13.150 --> 01:25:17.460
overrated outlets.
All right,
if fucking overrated.

1417
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:21.070
Unless there's a bunch of stores that you like,
then it's just convenient.

1418
01:25:21.340 --> 01:25:24.100
That's the best you're going to get.
You know,

1419
01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:28.420
it's convenient while at least I don't have to walk through a food court and two

1420
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:32.710
levels.
I like that.
It's just one level.
I do like that aspect of it.

1421
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:37.320
But in general,
I don't see the fucking deals.
It's like how you know,

1422
01:25:37.510 --> 01:25:37.931
do you know how to,

1423
01:25:37.931 --> 01:25:42.790
like Vegas used to be mob run and now it's corporate corporate owned and

1424
01:25:42.791 --> 01:25:46.960
gradually the,
the $8 steak disappeared that you could get it,

1425
01:25:46.961 --> 01:25:49.660
you can get a steak for like six bucks,
you can anymore.

1426
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:52.600
They turned them all into buffer.
The buffets,

1427
01:25:52.601 --> 01:25:56.080
it's like the $20 buffet and then you got to go there and feel like,
you know,

1428
01:25:56.470 --> 01:25:57.790
you ate your money's worth.

1429
01:25:59.050 --> 01:26:01.780
So you go there and eat 10 times more than you normally would have and then you

1430
01:26:01.781 --> 01:26:05.300
fuck your key killing yourself.
You have ever eat so much,
you start sweating.

1431
01:26:06.050 --> 01:26:07.880
You just have such a bizarre combination.

1432
01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.400
You can like rice and then a slice of cake,

1433
01:26:11.110 --> 01:26:14.510
some fucking pancakes and then a piece of fish,
you know your body's just like,

1434
01:26:14.511 --> 01:26:15.740
dude,
what the fuck?

1435
01:26:15.890 --> 01:26:19.280
And you finish it off with like a pickle Lindy just sitting there,
right.

1436
01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.650
Look at me like that guy on man versus food.
You know,

1437
01:26:22.740 --> 01:26:24.850
when he gets down to the final two bites,
any,

1438
01:26:24.851 --> 01:26:27.020
he goes into what I call the thinker pose,

1439
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:30.560
you know where he sketched got his fist up against his skull.

1440
01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.540
Yeah.
It's the same thing.
Outlets.
That's just,
it's,

1441
01:26:38.550 --> 01:26:41.640
it's the same hype that people used to say about Vegas.

1442
01:26:41.641 --> 01:26:46.560
People finally have stopped saying the,
the $6 steak bullshit.
Um,

1443
01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:49.500
all right,
so there you go.
That's overrated.
Underrated for the week.

1444
01:26:49.501 --> 01:26:52.150
Please keep sending those in people I love,
I love reading those things.

1445
01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:56.450
All right.
Advice for this week.
[inaudible] these are unbecoming.

1446
01:26:56.550 --> 01:26:58.890
Just sort of the relationship advice person.

1447
01:26:58.891 --> 01:27:02.730
I don't know how this has happened considering I've,
uh,

1448
01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.890
I've never been married.
I don't have any kids,
you know,
so I don't know.
You know,

1449
01:27:08.980 --> 01:27:12.750
I'm basically the Steve de Burgh of relationships.
You know,

1450
01:27:12.751 --> 01:27:16.320
I'm somehow still in the league,
still in the game,
pulled the clipboard,

1451
01:27:16.321 --> 01:27:20.330
but I haven't taken a fucking snap in like nine years.
Uh,

1452
01:27:20.340 --> 01:27:23.190
that's what I am standing on the sidelines as all you guys are getting married

1453
01:27:23.191 --> 01:27:27.060
and having kids just sitting here fucking wearing a headset.
All right?

1454
01:27:27.061 --> 01:27:31.710
But you guys want advice?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Uh,

1455
01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:34.950
okay.
So I've been together with my girl for almost four years.

1456
01:27:34.951 --> 01:27:38.790
Got Married last September in 2010.
Uh,

1457
01:27:38.791 --> 01:27:41.610
these past weeks have been health.
I'm a very honest person,

1458
01:27:41.611 --> 01:27:45.800
so I felt lately that me and my wife have not been close.

1459
01:27:45.870 --> 01:27:48.540
So I talked to my wife and told her how I felt and it,

1460
01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:53.100
and if we continue like this,
things can end up in divorce now.
Things will,

1461
01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:57.130
he stress can all capital can end up in divorce.
Uh,

1462
01:27:57.150 --> 01:28:01.710
so we talked it over and all seemed okay.
A Sunday,
the 20th,

1463
01:28:01.711 --> 01:28:05.490
I asked her when she was coming home,
uh,
this was at 10:20 PM.

1464
01:28:05.700 --> 01:28:10.440
She told me in the next 20 minutes,
I said,
okay,
cool.
I'll see you at home.
Uh,

1465
01:28:10.441 --> 01:28:13.650
I was driving home from a farther city,
so it took me longer to get home.

1466
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:18.300
I get home at 12:00 AM and she is still not home.
So I call her and say,

1467
01:28:18.570 --> 01:28:21.180
please tell me if you're not going to come home on time.
So I,

1468
01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:25.590
so I know you're okay.
All right.
Sounds like a decent guy.
What does she do?

1469
01:28:25.890 --> 01:28:28.380
She starts yelling at him.
Say

1470
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:30.660
<v 6>uh,
uh,</v>

1471
01:28:31.670 --> 01:28:32.750
<v 4>all right,
last me place.
Uh,</v>

1472
01:28:32.751 --> 01:28:37.220
she starts yelling at me saying I was helping my damn friend stop being an

1473
01:28:37.221 --> 01:28:42.200
asshole.
Then she hung up.
Wow.
Uh,

1474
01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:44.990
she got home and yelled at me and everything and we argued,

1475
01:28:44.991 --> 01:28:48.140
she went to bed mad at me and I slept on the couch.

1476
01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.160
First Time I've ever done that in our relationship,
that's par for the course.

1477
01:28:52.270 --> 01:28:53.210
You've got married in September,

1478
01:28:53.211 --> 01:28:56.120
you go through the honeymoon phase right through the holidays and all of a

1479
01:28:56.121 --> 01:28:59.720
sudden Valentine's Day comes up.
That's more excitement.

1480
01:29:00.020 --> 01:29:04.620
Now you were into March.
March is the real deal.
Okay.

1481
01:29:04.621 --> 01:29:08.520
If you can get along in March that that's that,
that's,
that's a good benchmark.

1482
01:29:08.521 --> 01:29:12.270
You know,
there's nothing going on in March.
There's no Valentine's Day.

1483
01:29:12.271 --> 01:29:16.530
There's no holidays.
Unless she has a birthday,
then it doesn't count.
They bill.

1484
01:29:16.531 --> 01:29:19.260
Why don't you shut the fuck up and read the rest of the email?
Alright.
Alright,

1485
01:29:19.330 --> 01:29:22.260
I will.
Alright,
next morning she leaves to work and I tell her,

1486
01:29:22.261 --> 01:29:26.220
I hope you hope you know me.
Sleeping on the couch is not a good thing.

1487
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:30.150
And she goes,
well,
me not kissing you before I leave isn't a good thing either.

1488
01:29:30.240 --> 01:29:34.020
Jesus,
later on Monday,
she says,

1489
01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.010
I am not sleeping at home tonight.
I don't know if I want to be with you anymore.

1490
01:29:39.990 --> 01:29:43.080
Jesus Christ,
dude,
this is like fucking going vertical here.

1491
01:29:44.010 --> 01:29:47.700
She's in the space shuttle.
Um,
it's Friday now.

1492
01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:49.560
In all week she has to come home to me.

1493
01:29:49.890 --> 01:29:52.020
She won't even tell me where she is sleeping.

1494
01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:56.790
Barely answers my texts and or calls.
She told me she isn't happy.

1495
01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:00.240
I don't treat her good.
She doesn't love me the way she used to,

1496
01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:04.950
but not once did she sit me down like a civil person and tell me to change.

1497
01:30:05.130 --> 01:30:09.450
She just up she up and just left.
Bill,

1498
01:30:09.451 --> 01:30:12.240
please tell me if you love someone and you're married,

1499
01:30:12.630 --> 01:30:16.830
would it be easy to just up and leave like that?
Uh,

1500
01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:21.330
leave that person with no warning and not giving the person a chance and less

1501
01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:25.640
she has another secret.
Oh geesh.

1502
01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:30.450
I think he suggesting that she might have another guy.
Uh,

1503
01:30:30.451 --> 01:30:33.720
she's filing for divorce soon,
Toby,
to keep everything.

1504
01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:38.190
She just wants her vehicle.
I'm dying inside and had been going crazy.

1505
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:40.530
I cannot believe she would put me through this.

1506
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:45.830
She said she's been thinking of this for two months but never sat me down so I

1507
01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:49.470
can work on being a better man while do two months is a long time.

1508
01:30:49.471 --> 01:30:51.300
When you only been married since September,

1509
01:30:51.450 --> 01:30:55.980
that's basically 20% of your marriage?
I would think so.
Anyways.

1510
01:30:55.981 --> 01:30:58.290
He goes on to say she had nothing when we met.

1511
01:30:58.530 --> 01:31:02.460
I drove her to school every day and her parents did not care for her.

1512
01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:06.210
I did everything for her.
Why would she screw me like this?

1513
01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:11.520
A boy.
All right.
Um,

1514
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:15.330
so what advice do you want here?
You want me to know why she would do this?

1515
01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:20.100
All right,
let's,
let's,
all right.
I'd have everything she said there.

1516
01:31:20.101 --> 01:31:23.610
I know all my listeners right now are pretty much convinced that she's out

1517
01:31:23.611 --> 01:31:27.630
fucking around on you.
And uh,
you know,
who's can hope.
They definitely,

1518
01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:29.580
I don't think would be wrong to think that,

1519
01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:35.120
but I think the fly in the ointment here is your description of her relationship

1520
01:31:35.401 --> 01:31:39.540
with their parents when you said that you drove her to school and did everything

1521
01:31:39.541 --> 01:31:43.670
for her yet her parents did not care for her.
Uh,

1522
01:31:43.680 --> 01:31:47.100
this is something that I noticed in my horrific dating past.

1523
01:31:48.690 --> 01:31:50.820
Um,
if you want to get somebody stable,

1524
01:31:50.821 --> 01:31:55.170
you have to come up with some sort of list of qualifications that they have to

1525
01:31:55.171 --> 01:31:59.040
pass or at least they have to pass most of them.
And one of the things,

1526
01:31:59.050 --> 01:32:01.150
if you want to get a well adjusted female,

1527
01:32:03.130 --> 01:32:03.963
<v 6>mmm.</v>

1528
01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.860
<v 4>I'm not saying that they can't come from divorced,</v>

1529
01:32:07.861 --> 01:32:12.430
but they have to have a good relationship with their parents.
Okay.

1530
01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:16.720
I found that to be a major red flag if I was on a date and I found out that the

1531
01:32:16.721 --> 01:32:20.380
person I was on a date with was not speaking to either their mother or their

1532
01:32:20.381 --> 01:32:22.090
father or would say,

1533
01:32:22.091 --> 01:32:27.020
my dad's a piece of shit or I fucking hate my mother or a,

1534
01:32:27.070 --> 01:32:28.600
we don't talk right there.

1535
01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:32.830
I'm telling you just run and the other direction because I don't know,

1536
01:32:32.831 --> 01:32:36.940
it just seeps into your fucking relationship.
And they do shit like this.

1537
01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:39.270
Cause I'm thinking if you were doing everything,

1538
01:32:39.280 --> 01:32:41.470
if she came from a household where her parents,

1539
01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:46.780
people who are supposed to love her unconditionally and they weren't doing shit

1540
01:32:46.781 --> 01:32:51.520
for her,
and then you come in there and you start doing everything for her,

1541
01:32:52.450 --> 01:32:57.450
just just out of never having that in our life on some level,

1542
01:32:57.491 --> 01:33:00.610
she's going to fall in love with you.
Even if she doesn't love you.

1543
01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:04.840
She loves you because you're giving her what her parents never gave,
gave her,

1544
01:33:05.410 --> 01:33:10.150
gave her,
you know what I mean?
But that doesn't mean that she loves you.

1545
01:33:10.151 --> 01:33:10.990
And I think that that's,

1546
01:33:10.991 --> 01:33:13.750
and then you combine the fact that she had a fucked up relationship with their

1547
01:33:13.751 --> 01:33:16.300
parents where there was no love and that type of stuff.

1548
01:33:16.510 --> 01:33:21.130
She doesn't know what love is and can't communicate.

1549
01:33:21.610 --> 01:33:23.230
And when she's not failing it,

1550
01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:25.540
she doesn't know how to get out of it like a fucking adult.

1551
01:33:25.570 --> 01:33:29.950
Hence she just leaves you.
And then because she's been searching for life,

1552
01:33:30.190 --> 01:33:34.840
love her entire fucking life,
rather than just going out on a fucking own

1553
01:33:36.550 --> 01:33:38.770
and just being alone and figuring out what she wants.

1554
01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:42.430
It kind of seems like she already has another guy and she's just swinging to

1555
01:33:42.431 --> 01:33:46.960
that dude.
I'm going right into another relationship.
So I'll tell you this.

1556
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:47.800
This is what I would do.

1557
01:33:47.801 --> 01:33:52.300
I would consider myself fucking lucky that she did it this quick,

1558
01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:55.900
that you found out that you were married to a psycho and that she only wants her

1559
01:33:55.901 --> 01:33:58.330
fucking car.
All right?

1560
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:03.010
So what I would do is give her her space.
Don't call her,

1561
01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.900
be civil.
Work the fucking thing out.
Sign the divorce papers.

1562
01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:12.400
Let her get in her fucking VW thing.
Whatever the fuck she drives,

1563
01:34:12.580 --> 01:34:17.300
and let her and her baggage drive down to the goddamn streets.
All right?

1564
01:34:17.301 --> 01:34:21.920
Then you fucking,
I dunno.
Do Usual Shit.
Go to the gym.

1565
01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:26.390
Cry It out.
Go to the fucking gym.
All right.

1566
01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:30.920
Don't beat yourself up.
Don't start drinking.
Don't start becoming a fat.
Fuck.

1567
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:34.520
All right.
Turn this shit around.
I'm telling you,

1568
01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.380
I don't come up with some healthy fucking way to deal with this shit.
Uh,

1569
01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.280
and don't do the Guy Shit where you're fucking white knuckle your way through it

1570
01:34:43.281 --> 01:34:46.970
and bows and go bang a fat chick.
Don't do that shit.
All right?
Fucking,

1571
01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:51.830
you know,
curl up in the fetal position and cry it out and just tell you,

1572
01:34:51.831 --> 01:34:54.230
keep telling yourself you're gonna meet the right girl.
Do that.

1573
01:34:54.231 --> 01:34:57.890
But that one right there,
dude,
flush that one down the fucking and kids.

1574
01:34:57.891 --> 01:34:59.840
It's a blessing.
It's a blessing.

1575
01:34:59.841 --> 01:35:04.100
Do can you imagine if you had a kid but that fucking nightmare and for the rest

1576
01:35:04.101 --> 01:35:07.760
of your fucking life,
or at least for the next 18 goddamn years,

1577
01:35:07.761 --> 01:35:11.300
she's going to be in your fucking life and you've got to listen to her opinions,

1578
01:35:11.510 --> 01:35:15.560
which would totally affect on some level your relationship with the next great

1579
01:35:15.561 --> 01:35:16.490
girl that you're going to meet.

1580
01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:18.890
Your next girl is going to be a great girl cause you've been through this shit

1581
01:35:18.891 --> 01:35:22.610
with this current.
Trust me.
All right,
it's going to hurt.

1582
01:35:23.660 --> 01:35:28.160
Just fucking deal with it.
All right,
platoon,
take the pain.
All right.
Okay.

1583
01:35:28.161 --> 01:35:30.910
That's it.
Next one.
All right,
Bill,
be in this girl.
Another,

1584
01:35:30.970 --> 01:35:32.570
another relationship won't be bill.

1585
01:35:32.571 --> 01:35:37.340
Me and this girl is stationed overseas in the military.
Uh,
England.

1586
01:35:37.341 --> 01:35:38.810
Lucky enough,
due to our jobs,

1587
01:35:38.811 --> 01:35:43.730
we see each other a couple times a week for meetings and at the gym here on my

1588
01:35:43.731 --> 01:35:44.900
47 dilemmas.

1589
01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.160
This is a chance of being deployed and all of that business due to the war with

1590
01:35:49.161 --> 01:35:53.990
yogurt face in Libya.
The least of my worries.
Oh,

1591
01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:57.680
by the way,
did you see that fucking,
there was a couple of,
uh,

1592
01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:59.733
<v 5>yeah.</v>

1593
01:35:59.810 --> 01:36:01.370
<v 4>What is it,
Osher?</v>

1594
01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:05.650
Beyonce and Mariah Carey actually did private new year's gigs for,

1595
01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:10.310
for 1 million bucks.
Did New Year's gigs for Gaddafi's kids.

1596
01:36:11.060 --> 01:36:14.210
Can you fucking believe that?
How much fucking money do you meet?
Need to make?

1597
01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.370
You know,
you're going to take a Gig?

1598
01:36:17.371 --> 01:36:22.371
Where are you going to go dance like a God damn fucking clown for a mass

1599
01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:28.720
murderers,
kids.
Then you take that fucking blood money,

1600
01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.650
stick it in your bank account.

1601
01:36:32.250 --> 01:36:35.610
Go Buy yourself some fucking glitter or whatever the hell you do when you're a

1602
01:36:36.180 --> 01:36:37.013
goddamn singer.

1603
01:36:37.650 --> 01:36:40.800
By some more streamers to hang on your fucking mic stand and then when you get

1604
01:36:40.801 --> 01:36:45.360
busted,
you try to play it off like you had no idea who Kadafi is

1605
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:48.530
and what he's done.
Yeah.

1606
01:36:48.531 --> 01:36:52.640
You couldn't remember that he claimed he was behind the Pan Am bombing that

1607
01:36:52.641 --> 01:36:55.070
killed fellow Americans to fuck is wrong with you.

1608
01:36:56.370 --> 01:36:56.700
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

1609
01:36:56.700 --> 01:37:00.390
<v 4>I love that shit.
Where they tried to play it off like they had no idea.
Okay.</v>

1610
01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.620
At the low level of entertainment that I'm at,
anytime I do a private Gig,

1611
01:37:05.010 --> 01:37:06.930
they always tell you what the deal is.

1612
01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:11.850
I don't do private gigs anymore because as Dane Cook,
classically put,

1613
01:37:11.851 --> 01:37:13.560
you feel like you're being rented.

1614
01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:18.450
That's the greatest way to describe how you feel when you do that kick.

1615
01:37:18.451 --> 01:37:19.284
See if you're doing it.

1616
01:37:19.410 --> 01:37:22.170
If you come out to a comedy club or a theater to see my act,

1617
01:37:23.010 --> 01:37:25.110
you get my act and I get to say whatever I want,

1618
01:37:25.111 --> 01:37:30.111
but if you hire me to perform for your your company or a private fucking

1619
01:37:30.991 --> 01:37:35.360
Christmas party or some shit like that,
like I used to do those gigs,
uh,

1620
01:37:35.370 --> 01:37:37.650
there's always a list.
This is what they do.

1621
01:37:37.651 --> 01:37:42.651
Stay away from this and you either comply to the list or you just don't take the

1622
01:37:43.981 --> 01:37:48.000
Gig.
The last thing you do is say,
yeah,
yeah,
no,
no,
no problem.
Then you show up,

1623
01:37:48.001 --> 01:37:52.590
you do your Lenny Bruce fucking set and then walk away thinking you're a Badass.

1624
01:37:52.620 --> 01:37:54.330
You're not a bad ass.
You just an asshole.

1625
01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:57.360
If you're to go in there and curse and they wanted to clean comic,

1626
01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:02.160
he should've taken the Gig.
They're hiring you private Gig,
right?
So buddy,
any.

1627
01:38:02.190 --> 01:38:04.680
Anyways,
anytime I do a Gig,

1628
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:07.920
if there's somebody in a fucking wheelchair,

1629
01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:11.850
if there's somebody mentally handicapped,
just that shit alone,

1630
01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:13.800
they'll poke their head in the back.
Hey,
just to let you know,

1631
01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:16.980
I don't know what jokes should do,
but this is the situation out there.

1632
01:38:16.981 --> 01:38:20.760
Just giving you the heads up so there's no problem.
There's no fucking way.

1633
01:38:21.210 --> 01:38:23.370
They're agents didn't say,
hey,
listen,

1634
01:38:23.490 --> 01:38:27.570
just to let you know you're performing for the children of a mass murderer.

1635
01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:31.740
This is how they feel about females over there.
Stay away from this.

1636
01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:36.720
You're able to gyrate this much during songs.
There was a whole fucking,

1637
01:38:36.721 --> 01:38:38.250
it's $1 million gig.

1638
01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:43.050
There's no way the agent lets the artists go in there not knowing who the fuck

1639
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:48.170
they're performing for with performing to risking losing their commission on $1

1640
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:52.410
million fucking Gig.
They're completely full of shit.

1641
01:38:52.411 --> 01:38:56.310
They're just giving the money back cause they got fucking caught.
I,
Eh,
it's,

1642
01:38:56.370 --> 01:39:00.360
I think it's horrific.
Absolutely horrific.
So anyways,
back to the email.

1643
01:39:01.740 --> 01:39:06.300
Um,
so we've both been here being this broad for about six months,
six months.

1644
01:39:06.390 --> 01:39:08.190
Okay.
Let me recap here.
Up until this point,

1645
01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:12.870
he sees his girl a couple times a week.
All right?
Okay.
So the two dilemmas,

1646
01:39:12.900 --> 01:39:13.950
he works with the girl.

1647
01:39:13.951 --> 01:39:17.220
And also if he starts developing feelings at any plump point,

1648
01:39:17.221 --> 01:39:20.280
he could get deployed to Libya and she couldn't,
she might not,

1649
01:39:20.310 --> 01:39:24.960
or they might both.
And uh,
there'll be in separate parts of the country now.

1650
01:39:24.961 --> 01:39:28.590
Fuck it.
See each other.
You know what I mean?
I don't fucking know.

1651
01:39:28.650 --> 01:39:30.780
I don't even wanna say,
how the fuck can we start a third war?

1652
01:39:30.810 --> 01:39:35.670
We couldn't even afford one.
I really don't understand it.
All right,

1653
01:39:35.671 --> 01:39:38.880
let's continue here.
Uh,
we've both been here about six months.
In that time,

1654
01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:41.670
everyone on the basis tried to get into this chick's pants.

1655
01:39:42.090 --> 01:39:46.290
She's a bomb shell for certain,
no one seems to get close.
How,
how,
uh,

1656
01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:50.040
however I come to find out she's basically got dumped,
uh,

1657
01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:54.480
when she left her last base state side and has been cooped up in her house off

1658
01:39:54.481 --> 01:39:56.670
base trying to keep in touch with this dude.

1659
01:39:56.671 --> 01:39:59.250
She's rarely gone out and hasn't given date dating or whatever.

1660
01:39:59.251 --> 01:40:01.710
Much of a thought as far as I can wager.
Meanwhile,

1661
01:40:01.711 --> 01:40:06.711
I've been busy being miserable on my own as well as this as I had this stint

1662
01:40:07.051 --> 01:40:11.130
with some cock Copchick over the winter and that basically died about two to

1663
01:40:11.131 --> 01:40:12.090
three weeks ago.

1664
01:40:12.270 --> 01:40:17.270
I start talking to this broad and spending time together regularly after work.

1665
01:40:17.490 --> 01:40:20.850
Nothing too seriously,
but apparently I can make her left.
Uh,

1666
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.700
getting the notion that she's moving on from her old relationship,

1667
01:40:23.701 --> 01:40:25.890
things seem to be going swimmingly.

1668
01:40:26.550 --> 01:40:29.850
I'm just not certain I can take the multiple risks and try to make a situation

1669
01:40:29.851 --> 01:40:34.200
out of this that that wouldn't somehow end up in some sort of complete disaster.

1670
01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:38.010
I'm technically shitting where I eat and it's not like I could just quit this

1671
01:40:38.011 --> 01:40:39.960
job tomorrow.
I'm in the fucking military.

1672
01:40:40.230 --> 01:40:42.720
I'm trying to avoid certain disaster yet.
However,

1673
01:40:42.721 --> 01:40:45.300
I'm prime to be in the zone for a good,

1674
01:40:45.510 --> 01:40:49.080
real good looking piece and perhaps a healthy relationship thereafter.

1675
01:40:49.260 --> 01:40:52.620
I'm not sure how far,
how far to take this thing.
I'm conflicted.

1676
01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:57.670
I could use a laugh.
Thanks for the podcast.
All right.
All right,
dude.

1677
01:40:57.671 --> 01:40:59.890
These are very fucking mature concerns.

1678
01:41:01.670 --> 01:41:02.503
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1679
01:41:03.390 --> 01:41:07.380
<v 4>This is all up to you.
You've got to figure out how you feel about this girl.</v>

1680
01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:10.680
All right.
And then act accordingly.
All right.

1681
01:41:10.710 --> 01:41:14.370
If you want to fucking just bang this girl,
if you figure that out,

1682
01:41:14.371 --> 01:41:15.870
if you just want to bang this girl,

1683
01:41:16.050 --> 01:41:20.730
just be upfront and tell her that it's just a sex thing and she either goes for

1684
01:41:20.731 --> 01:41:23.430
it or she does it.
All right?

1685
01:41:23.431 --> 01:41:27.240
And if she goes for it and you're banger and then you don't call her afterwards

1686
01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:31.160
or you,
you know,
you're just still not having feelings for,

1687
01:41:31.410 --> 01:41:36.210
she can't get mad legitimately because you talked to her about it up front.

1688
01:41:36.420 --> 01:41:38.070
Of course there's always that,
you know,

1689
01:41:38.130 --> 01:41:41.190
18% psycho rule where she could be thinking,

1690
01:41:41.191 --> 01:41:45.780
well after he fucks me going to realize what a great person I am and that we'll

1691
01:41:45.781 --> 01:41:47.400
have a relationship.
You know,

1692
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:52.740
I would be a little bit nervous about this girl because she's still hanging onto

1693
01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:53.570
this other person.

1694
01:41:53.570 --> 01:41:57.320
So I don't know if she's just wounded or if she is an actual psycho.

1695
01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:01.160
So I will tell you this,
if you just have a fuck buddy relationship with her,

1696
01:42:01.660 --> 01:42:03.830
this is the key.
All right?

1697
01:42:03.831 --> 01:42:07.670
You have to space out the times when you bang her.

1698
01:42:08.670 --> 01:42:11.600
All right?
And when you bang her,
she can never spend the night.

1699
01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.790
You also can't watch a movie with her.

1700
01:42:13.791 --> 01:42:18.230
You can't do any sort of things that indicate you have some sort of relationship

1701
01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:21.050
beyond fucking all right?

1702
01:42:22.330 --> 01:42:25.870
And you have to bang her like the filthy fucking whore that she is.

1703
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:30.940
That's basically how you sustain a fuck buddy relationship.

1704
01:42:31.690 --> 01:42:33.970
You fucking,
you leave and that's all you do.

1705
01:42:33.971 --> 01:42:36.550
We are fuck buddies were not movie slash fuck buddies.

1706
01:42:36.551 --> 01:42:39.250
We have fuck buddies and that is it.
All right.

1707
01:42:39.251 --> 01:42:42.670
If she calls you up and asked you to come over there and help hang a fucking

1708
01:42:42.671 --> 01:42:47.020
picture,
you don't have time.
You can't fucking do it.
All right.
That's it.

1709
01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.730
You are,
you are a deck and that's it.
Now,

1710
01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:52.320
if you want to have a fucking relationship with her,

1711
01:42:52.640 --> 01:42:55.470
you've got to figure out if you really liked this girl,
at which point,

1712
01:42:55.471 --> 01:42:56.310
if you're mature enough,

1713
01:42:56.311 --> 01:43:00.210
you probably shouldn't try and fucker cause that will cloud everything.
Uh,

1714
01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.640
personally,
I've never been able to do that.
So good luck to you.

1715
01:43:02.670 --> 01:43:06.030
Those are your two options.
Fuck buddy relationship.

1716
01:43:06.870 --> 01:43:10.530
Figure out what the fuck you wanna do and then act accordingly.
All right sir.

1717
01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:11.813
Good luck.

1718
01:43:13.630 --> 01:43:14.463
<v 6>MMM.</v>

1719
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:18.720
<v 4>Hey Bill.
Uh,
I'm going on my 11th hour of work today,
but up it up.
Oh,</v>

1720
01:43:18.721 --> 01:43:22.270
I can read that part there.
Too many names here.
Okay.
Anyway,
spill.

1721
01:43:22.271 --> 01:43:25.180
I was fat and in a destructive relationship for most of college.

1722
01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.300
My confidence was just about ruined before I dumped the cut.
Uh,

1723
01:43:29.710 --> 01:43:33.580
and I lost about 70 pounds.
Good for you.
See,
this guy did the right thing.

1724
01:43:33.670 --> 01:43:37.150
He got it for that guy with the first question.
This guy here,

1725
01:43:37.151 --> 01:43:41.920
he got out of a relationship.
All right,
now look what happens.
It goes to the gym.

1726
01:43:41.921 --> 01:43:44.860
He dropped 70 pounds.
Good for you.
So that said,

1727
01:43:44.861 --> 01:43:47.830
I've been with a lot of women and haven't had trouble meeting women.

1728
01:43:48.490 --> 01:43:51.620
I just know how to act confident.
I have trouble,
fine.

1729
01:43:51.650 --> 01:43:56.650
But I do have car trouble finding the line between asshole aggressiveness and

1730
01:43:56.991 --> 01:44:00.560
simply being confident.
Um,
all right,

1731
01:44:00.590 --> 01:44:04.070
well you're already banging a bunch of women.
You've lost 70 pounds.

1732
01:44:04.071 --> 01:44:06.680
It sounds like you're killing it.
So what,
what happened?

1733
01:44:06.681 --> 01:44:08.150
Did you piss off a couple of women?

1734
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.090
What is your definition of asshole aggressiveness?

1735
01:44:11.210 --> 01:44:14.720
Or you talking to them be like,
hey baby,
you just reach up and grab a titty.

1736
01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:18.920
You know,
this is the thing about being confident,

1737
01:44:19.340 --> 01:44:23.000
which you got to do is be confident about yourself.
But don't insult the woman.

1738
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:25.780
Don't like,
I've never liked that.

1739
01:44:25.810 --> 01:44:29.540
Like some guys do that what they do is they go up there and how they,

1740
01:44:29.570 --> 01:44:34.160
how they get the girl to be in a weak position is they sort of,
uh,

1741
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:38.270
say things to her that,
that kind of makes her like insecure.

1742
01:44:39.650 --> 01:44:43.280
Um,
I dunno,
wait,
what is a good example of that type of stuff?

1743
01:44:44.780 --> 01:44:48.380
Like I know you can just make some sort of comment about the clothes they're

1744
01:44:48.381 --> 01:44:52.880
wearing or just something or just be like,
oh,

1745
01:44:52.881 --> 01:44:54.620
what is an example?
I see.
I never did that.

1746
01:44:54.621 --> 01:44:58.850
Not because I'm a fucking great guy just because I have a need to be liked so I

1747
01:44:58.851 --> 01:45:01.400
could never go that way.
Um,

1748
01:45:01.401 --> 01:45:06.140
although I have found that like reacting to other hot girls walking around the

1749
01:45:06.141 --> 01:45:09.860
club with a lot of girls will somehow,

1750
01:45:11.240 --> 01:45:12.920
I don't know,
it's just weird thing with it.

1751
01:45:12.921 --> 01:45:16.160
Like that's sort of their competitiveness,
you know,

1752
01:45:16.161 --> 01:45:19.820
if he could just get into conversation about them,
about,
you know,

1753
01:45:19.910 --> 01:45:22.820
how hot you think some other girl is.
I know that sounds fucked,

1754
01:45:22.821 --> 01:45:24.170
but this has actually worked for me.

1755
01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:29.930
And then you just start talking about what you like in women,
what turns you on,

1756
01:45:29.931 --> 01:45:32.600
and then you steer the conversation into sex and then you're in there.

1757
01:45:32.601 --> 01:45:37.601
So I would say for me the difference between being an asshole aggressive is if I

1758
01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.620
actually say something mean,

1759
01:45:41.740 --> 01:45:42.573
<v 6>uh,</v>

1760
01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:43.530
<v 4>I dunno,</v>

1761
01:45:43.530 --> 01:45:46.980
I don't think she'd ever be mean to a girl to try and get her to fuck you.

1762
01:45:46.981 --> 01:45:49.500
I just think that's like a cowardly way into it.
But you know,

1763
01:45:49.501 --> 01:45:53.880
for you to be a cocky asshole
and if they just,

1764
01:45:53.881 --> 01:45:57.740
if they say that they compliment you about how you look,
just be like,
yeah,
no,

1765
01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:00.330
I'm a,
you know,
I'm a good looking guy.
I don't know what it is.

1766
01:46:00.810 --> 01:46:03.870
Women like me just just along those fucking lines.

1767
01:46:04.470 --> 01:46:08.180
You just do that as,
as you're sort of making fun,
funny yourself.

1768
01:46:08.310 --> 01:46:09.810
Then you show you have a sense of humor.
I would,

1769
01:46:09.890 --> 01:46:11.970
I would try to go that fucking route.
I don't know.
But once again,

1770
01:46:11.971 --> 01:46:15.150
you're talking to a guy looks like Ralph mouth self.
It probably works here.

1771
01:46:15.151 --> 01:46:15.481
You guys,

1772
01:46:15.481 --> 01:46:18.480
maybe you guys can be assholes if you actually have some sort of pigment in your

1773
01:46:18.481 --> 01:46:21.480
hair.
Um,
all right,
let's plow ahead here.
A bill,

1774
01:46:21.481 --> 01:46:24.270
a friend of mine who I played in the bandwidth for over a year in high school,

1775
01:46:24.271 --> 01:46:29.271
lost his mother to a sudden Sart sudden heart attack at the memorial service.

1776
01:46:29.730 --> 01:46:34.410
I get out of my Dorky hippie Ford fusion hybrid at the Church and see a smoking

1777
01:46:34.411 --> 01:46:39.411
hot chick climbing out of a white 2010 Ford Mustang gt with racing stripes and

1778
01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:45.420
walks inside.
Do that.
Sounds like the beginning of a great fucking movie.

1779
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:51.300
You know,
the nerd is a little douchey car.
And then some Hottie,
you know,

1780
01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:55.800
was it Christie Brinkley from those fucking a European vacation movies?

1781
01:46:56.970 --> 01:47:01.350
Um,
anyways,
it was mysterious and intriguing at the same time.
Exactly.

1782
01:47:02.370 --> 01:47:07.080
Uh,
I didn't know too many people at the funeral and uh,
I was the only guy.

1783
01:47:07.980 --> 01:47:12.060
What?
I didn't know too many people here as I only met the guy through my younger

1784
01:47:12.061 --> 01:47:14.730
brother.
It was not super close with him.

1785
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:19.380
Then what the fuck are you doing with the funeral?
At the funeral?

1786
01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:25.830
Jesus Christ.
I'm his mother was an artist who after after the receiving line,

1787
01:47:25.831 --> 01:47:29.730
there was a reception with her art displayed around the room and I was sipping

1788
01:47:29.731 --> 01:47:32.400
coffee and looking at some of her art.

1789
01:47:32.401 --> 01:47:36.600
This is a fucking cool last funeral looking at some of her art on the wall.

1790
01:47:36.601 --> 01:47:39.540
I clants to my right and there she is standing right next to me.

1791
01:47:39.870 --> 01:47:42.990
I lean in and I say,
I like your car.

1792
01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:46.050
45 minutes later after learning,

1793
01:47:47.100 --> 01:47:51.080
she is a nurse at a local hospital and graduated from my,

1794
01:47:51.081 --> 01:47:54.240
I learned that she was a nurse from a local hospital and graduated from my high

1795
01:47:54.241 --> 01:47:57.540
school.
Dude is this girl like a call girl.

1796
01:47:57.541 --> 01:47:59.100
If this sounds like a fucking call girl,

1797
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:05.760
she just shows up in a hot car dressed like a fucking hottie and she's a Fushi

1798
01:48:05.761 --> 01:48:09.780
wearing the nurse's outfit.
Anyways,
he goes on to say,

1799
01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:14.760
I knew her family a little bit.
She loves sports.
I love sports care.

1800
01:48:14.761 --> 01:48:17.970
I decided to say goodbye to her or not asked for her number.
I mean,

1801
01:48:17.971 --> 01:48:22.440
it's a fucking funeral dude.
There's no rules when it comes to getting late.

1802
01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:26.670
Okay.
I don't give a shit if you fucking tread water after a tsunami.

1803
01:48:27.390 --> 01:48:31.710
All right.
She didn't have time to put a brown.

1804
01:48:31.711 --> 01:48:34.350
She's got a t shirt on.
What?
You're not going to fucking,
you know,

1805
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:38.400
can't ask for a number at that point or fucking cell phones under water.
I guess.

1806
01:48:38.401 --> 01:48:42.720
You know.
Hey,
you want to form a two person circle over here?

1807
01:48:42.810 --> 01:48:47.690
I heard it keeps the sharks away.
Sorry.
I'm anyway

1808
01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:52.590
Blah Blah Blah.
But thanks to Facebook I get,
I find a route.

1809
01:48:52.650 --> 01:48:57.500
I find where the fuck she is her name as she has all these pictures.
Uh,
uh,

1810
01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:00.390
but she has all these pictures of her in some Chunky kid worse than the college

1811
01:49:00.391 --> 01:49:04.200
version of me.
She also has some status about a great Valentine's Day about,

1812
01:49:04.201 --> 01:49:05.820
but nothing about being in a relationship.

1813
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:08.640
I know this sounds like teeny bop ship at this girl was amazing.

1814
01:49:08.641 --> 01:49:12.030
We hit it off and I sure don't want to fuck it up with some awkward shit.

1815
01:49:12.030 --> 01:49:13.710
We've exchanged a few emails and stuff,

1816
01:49:13.711 --> 01:49:16.950
but I don't know how to find out her deal without just asking.

1817
01:49:16.951 --> 01:49:20.130
I also don't want to come on too strong and ruin the friendship fetus by

1818
01:49:20.131 --> 01:49:22.650
creeping her out.
I want to ask her to her.

1819
01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.250
I want to ask her to the anti social network show that you guys are doing with

1820
01:49:26.251 --> 01:49:29.540
Jim Norton.
Jim Breuer and David Tell,
uh,
but I have a real,

1821
01:49:29.541 --> 01:49:33.930
a fear of ruining the great vibe we have with something she might not be

1822
01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:36.780
accepting.
All right?
To what you're basically doing by sitting here,

1823
01:49:36.781 --> 01:49:40.440
being timid is you're getting yourself into that Chris rock friend zone.

1824
01:49:40.890 --> 01:49:43.080
You have to meet,
you have to make a move right now.

1825
01:49:43.770 --> 01:49:47.040
You talked to her at the fucking funeral,

1826
01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:49.840
talked to you for 45 minutes at a,
at a funeral.

1827
01:49:50.350 --> 01:49:53.800
You didn't ask for the number right there.
You should have lost the game,

1828
01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:56.770
but because everybody gets a ribbon with this generation,

1829
01:49:57.670 --> 01:49:59.470
there's Facebook so you get to fucking make it up.

1830
01:49:59.470 --> 01:50:03.040
Now she's exchanging emails with you.
How many more fucking clues do you need?

1831
01:50:03.730 --> 01:50:07.780
She has a vague sort of relationship status on her.
Facebook

1832
01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:13.630
asks her to the fucking show.
It's perfect.
All right,

1833
01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:16.300
you go into comedy show will make her laugh.

1834
01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:20.020
You sit there laughing it up with our accidentally put her hand on your hand on

1835
01:50:20.021 --> 01:50:23.470
a fucking thigh and your Ed.
I know it's not that easy,
but dude,

1836
01:50:23.471 --> 01:50:25.840
you need to ask her out sooner rather than fucking later.

1837
01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:30.790
And I have a go to a comedy show.
That'd be great.
I think that'd be a great idea.

1838
01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:34.300
And a,
that's it.
All right,
so ask her out.

1839
01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:37.630
That's my advice for this fucking week and I apologize for my horrific reading.

1840
01:50:37.930 --> 01:50:40.900
Let me give you some youtube videos here that we'll all be up on the MM

1841
01:50:40.901 --> 01:50:43.630
podcast.com the official fan,

1842
01:50:44.110 --> 01:50:48.760
a website of the Monday morning podcast.
We had 7,500 hits last week.

1843
01:50:48.761 --> 01:50:49.870
That's the most we've ever gotten.

1844
01:50:49.871 --> 01:50:53.680
So I want to thank everybody who has been going there.
Um,
so here we go.

1845
01:50:53.681 --> 01:50:55.040
Here's a youtube videos for the week.

1846
01:50:55.050 --> 01:50:58.540
If you don't want to go up and look at them individually on Youtube,

1847
01:50:58.541 --> 01:50:59.590
you can look at them.
All right.

1848
01:50:59.710 --> 01:51:03.070
No neat little row on the [inaudible] podcast.com.
All right.

1849
01:51:04.030 --> 01:51:08.800
For those of you who are into drugs,
man,
um,
we got a great one,

1850
01:51:08.801 --> 01:51:13.690
about a 1961.
It's a video on mushrooms and I believe,

1851
01:51:13.691 --> 01:51:15.820
I can't really tell what's going on here.
Uh,

1852
01:51:15.821 --> 01:51:18.970
I think it's the beginning of ecstasy.
I have no idea what,

1853
01:51:18.971 --> 01:51:22.450
but it's just great listening to the weird music that they're playing when they

1854
01:51:22.451 --> 01:51:26.800
describe what these mushrooms do to you.
Um,
Elvis is date rape,
blue,

1855
01:51:26.801 --> 01:51:30.520
Hawaii Blue Hawaii trailer.
Um,

1856
01:51:30.550 --> 01:51:33.070
it's just a bunch of clips of Elvis right before he bangs.

1857
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:36.820
A lot of checks and some of the shit that he gets away with just being mean and

1858
01:51:36.821 --> 01:51:41.821
being really misogynistic and not to mention what's fucking hilarious is he

1859
01:51:42.641 --> 01:51:45.610
doesn't have a shirt on in most of it cause he's on the beach.

1860
01:51:45.611 --> 01:51:49.660
And just to see what being in shape look like back in the day.

1861
01:51:49.661 --> 01:51:54.661
He has no abs and he has these little seventh grade arms in a,

1862
01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:59.320
in a little fucking chest,
little chicken chess,
but basically in chip,

1863
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:03.850
in shape back in the fifties and sixties.
Just meant you weren't fat.
Uh,

1864
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:06.010
I mean you just suck in your gut a little bit,
but,
uh,

1865
01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:10.780
he is the most horrific bathing suit I've ever seen in my life.
And uh,
I dunno,

1866
01:52:11.260 --> 01:52:15.880
you could basically do a nine hour seminar at a feminist convention if they just

1867
01:52:15.881 --> 01:52:19.500
show this entire just the movie trailer alone.
Um,

1868
01:52:19.770 --> 01:52:22.180
this is a bizarre video is a hidden camera.

1869
01:52:22.870 --> 01:52:25.030
British cunt threatens to ruin ex's life.

1870
01:52:25.330 --> 01:52:28.270
This guy is marriage is falling apart and he's filming it.

1871
01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:31.090
It's just really bizarre.
Uh,

1872
01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.790
if you like watching something really fucking awkward,

1873
01:52:34.090 --> 01:52:37.900
just definitely check it out.
And um,
oh,
here's a new one.

1874
01:52:38.470 --> 01:52:42.130
This is what I call a pre nine 11.

1875
01:52:42.610 --> 01:52:43.750
These youtube videos.

1876
01:52:43.751 --> 01:52:48.751
We just see people doing shit and public that nowadays would end with a felony

1877
01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:54.020
and the person on TV scolding them.
Um,
I know I've showed this video before,

1878
01:52:54.021 --> 01:52:57.380
but man jumps out of stands and catches football just in case for the new

1879
01:52:57.381 --> 01:53:01.280
podcast listeners on one Monday night football game,
uh,
the bears first,

1880
01:53:01.281 --> 01:53:05.570
the packers,
somebody kicked a field goal and as it's going through the uprights,

1881
01:53:05.571 --> 01:53:09.800
this guy jumps out of the stands and catches it.
I mean,

1882
01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:13.550
you'd get tasered and you'd be put in jail immediately.
Now,

1883
01:53:13.551 --> 01:53:18.440
and not only does this guy not get tasered,
he goes back to the fucking stance.

1884
01:53:18.610 --> 01:53:22.880
He's allowed to continue watching the game and Dan Deardorff and Al Al Michaels

1885
01:53:22.940 --> 01:53:26.270
or just laughing their fucking asses off tickets.
The greatest thing ever.

1886
01:53:26.510 --> 01:53:29.600
And it just makes me think about,
oh,
it wasn't a great before nine 11,

1887
01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.120
we could have a great time and do shit like that.

1888
01:53:32.121 --> 01:53:35.930
And it was just considered all innocent fun and it didn't have to be treated

1889
01:53:35.931 --> 01:53:39.320
like it was that it was out of a Sama bin Laden who just jumped out of the

1890
01:53:39.321 --> 01:53:42.590
fucking stance and a,
all right,
the next youtube video,

1891
01:53:43.490 --> 01:53:48.200
this is a,
this is one for John Bonam fans.
This is a very rare video,

1892
01:53:48.201 --> 01:53:49.700
or just one I've never seen.

1893
01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:55.030
It's a Paul Mccartney video where it's Paul Mccartney and wings and friends at

1894
01:53:55.031 --> 01:53:59.090
some horrifically awful,
awful song called the rocket star theme.

1895
01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:00.231
But they,
you know,

1896
01:54:00.231 --> 01:54:03.290
one of those things where they put together like an all star cast of people to

1897
01:54:03.291 --> 01:54:06.560
raise money.
Um,
kind of like a precursor to the,

1898
01:54:06.561 --> 01:54:10.040
we are the world thing and they have three drummers to three drummers.

1899
01:54:10.160 --> 01:54:13.550
And one of them is John Bonam is not only is he not playing Ludwig's,

1900
01:54:14.420 --> 01:54:15.620
he's playing this drum kit.

1901
01:54:15.650 --> 01:54:20.210
I don't know if it's a north drum kit or there was another drum kit out there

1902
01:54:20.211 --> 01:54:24.710
called a sting ray in the late seventies and early eighties.
They had these,
uh,

1903
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:29.950
this radical design on the drums where they sort of had the bottom of the drum.

1904
01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:34.370
It looks like it's made.
If you were on acid and you were looking at a drum kit,

1905
01:54:34.371 --> 01:54:38.180
looks like it's melted and it's pointed out at the crowd,

1906
01:54:38.181 --> 01:54:40.130
allegedly at major Tom sound better.
But see,

1907
01:54:40.131 --> 01:54:44.400
the only time I've ever seen John Bonam not playing,
uh,

1908
01:54:44.420 --> 01:54:48.080
one of his famous Ludwick kits in any of the drummers out there.

1909
01:54:48.081 --> 01:54:51.710
Can you please tell me what the kit is?
Cause I looked it up on the internet.

1910
01:54:51.711 --> 01:54:56.240
I tried to find images of sting,
ray drum kits,
and,

1911
01:54:57.020 --> 01:55:01.900
um,
I saw a couple of the modern ones where they had the warp,
uh,

1912
01:55:02.510 --> 01:55:06.920
Tom's,
but I couldn't find any of the classic ones.
Uh,

1913
01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.760
like looked through my old modern drummer one magazines and I couldn't find it.

1914
01:55:10.761 --> 01:55:14.450
But if anybody knows the name of the drum kit,
I'd love to know.
Uh,
all right.

1915
01:55:14.451 --> 01:55:17.450
And that's it.
I think that's it for this,
uh,
for this week.

1916
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:23.240
Um,
yeah,
that's it.
A couple of movies.
Somebody says to move.

1917
01:55:23.241 --> 01:55:27.800
We do avoid battle Los Angeles.
Uh,
it is,

1918
01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.490
it was like Independence Day took a shit all over the expendables.

1919
01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.050
Just didn't buy into it.

1920
01:55:33.051 --> 01:55:36.710
Maybe it's because I've been sober for a while and I saw it with a few potheads

1921
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:38.210
who love the two death,

1922
01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:42.800
wouldn't shut the fuck up during the movie and kept making stupid comments like,

1923
01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:47.490
dude,
we're fucked.
Um,
yeah.
I mean,
come on.

1924
01:55:47.491 --> 01:55:50.310
Who goes to bat a Los Angeles and actually thinks it's going to be chariots of

1925
01:55:50.311 --> 01:55:53.970
fire?
Which I actually thought that movie sucked.
Uh,
yeah,

1926
01:55:54.180 --> 01:55:57.750
I think you need to smoke the meat.
That's the movie that that movie is for.

1927
01:55:57.751 --> 01:56:01.440
Potheads that's one,
you know,
eat a fucking,
you know,

1928
01:56:01.441 --> 01:56:05.760
a little weed cookie and go see it and have a good time.
Um,

1929
01:56:06.050 --> 01:56:09.780
see that's right there.
There you go.
There's something positive about weed.

1930
01:56:09.781 --> 01:56:14.781
It makes mu awful movies like battle Los Angeles enjoyable and like relevant.

1931
01:56:17.190 --> 01:56:20.550
And somebody said Lincoln Lincoln lawyer was awesome.
All right,
that's it.

1932
01:56:21.270 --> 01:56:24.240
That is the podcast for this week.
You guys all have a great week.

1933
01:56:24.241 --> 01:56:27.540
Thanks for everybody who listens to the Monday morning podcast.

1934
01:56:27.541 --> 01:56:32.100
If you want to hear that epic argument,
uh,
that I had with a red band,

1935
01:56:32.130 --> 01:56:35.190
you know,
and yes,
we are friends.
We got along great.

1936
01:56:35.191 --> 01:56:38.400
Actually did a set itself comedy hole and we laughed about the arguments.

1937
01:56:38.401 --> 01:56:40.170
So you know,

1938
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.770
there's no reason to gossip anything beyond if you just really want to listen to

1939
01:56:43.771 --> 01:56:48.390
a great argument of two people who just don't know how to say,
agree to disagree,

1940
01:56:49.170 --> 01:56:50.860
uh,
I definitely suggest to listen to her.
Elsa,

1941
01:56:50.940 --> 01:56:55.530
definitely recommend subscribing to Joe Rogan's podcast.
It's fucking awesome.

1942
01:56:55.531 --> 01:56:58.260
I had a great time on it and that's it.
That's a podcast for this week.

1943
01:56:58.770 --> 01:57:03.770
I will see some of you at the Gibson MP theater on April 2nd for the,

1944
01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:08.010
uh,
Kevin and being comedy show that raises money for,
I forget what,

1945
01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:12.990
cause I know it's a great cause because no one ever raises money for terrorists,

1946
01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:16.680
right?
I guess unless you do a comedy show on like Saudi Arabia,

1947
01:57:16.740 --> 01:57:18.900
isn't that what they do?
You know,

1948
01:57:18.960 --> 01:57:21.540
that's how they raised money with their filthy fucking oil money.

1949
01:57:22.830 --> 01:57:25.380
Then they funnel it through the mask.
Isn't that how it goes down?

1950
01:57:25.710 --> 01:57:28.160
Is that other paper trail goes down?
Do you guys leave?

1951
01:57:28.161 --> 01:57:29.550
Read Rolling Stone magazine?

1952
01:57:30.480 --> 01:57:33.540
You've got to check it out on these two pot heads who became international arms

1953
01:57:33.541 --> 01:57:35.640
dealers.
It's really interesting to watch too.

1954
01:57:35.641 --> 01:57:40.641
Kids get involved in that type of shit and also to see how that game is run and

1955
01:57:41.230 --> 01:57:45.930
also kind of makes you understand while why certain countries really do not like

1956
01:57:46.290 --> 01:57:50.070
other countries and kind of what's going on.
It's just completely fucked.

1957
01:57:52.290 --> 01:57:55.800
<v 7>Um,
so I definitely recommend checking that out and I,
that's it.
All right.</v>

1958
01:57:56.070 --> 01:57:59.190
Can I just shut the fuck up now?
I'm going to shut the fuck up now.
All right,

1959
01:57:59.191 --> 01:58:02.070
you guys have a great week.
Go Fuck yourself and I'll talk to you later.

1960
01:58:41.950 --> 01:58:41.950
<v 3>[inaudible].</v>
