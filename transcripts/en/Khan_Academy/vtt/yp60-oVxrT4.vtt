00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.640
We now know what an oxidation
state or an oxidation number

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.350
is and what it means
when things

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.610
are oxidized or reduced.

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:10.510
So let's see how that actually
happens in reactions.

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.050
So what we're going to study
in this video is oxidation

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.060
slash reduction reactions.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.270
All that is is a reaction
where somebody's being

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.640
oxidized, which means that
electrons are being taken away

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.700
from them, and someone's being
reduced, which means that

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.860
they're being handed electrons,
or they're taking

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.110
electrons away from
someone else.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.260
Sometimes this has been termed--
because you have the

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.630
R-E-D in reduction and you have
the ox in oxidation, and

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.130
they switch them around and
they call this a redox

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.440
reaction, which sounds like a
very fancy chemistry term, but

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.880
it just means a reaction where
something is getting oxidized.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.820
And if something is getting
oxidized, something else is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.090
getting reduced.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:53.920
So let's study a
couple of them.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.770
So right here, I actually
have combustion.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.510
This is actually methane.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.220
So methane is a fuel.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.120
You can make a motor powered
on methane right there.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.050
It's a hydrocarbon.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.200
Most fuels that we use are
hydrocarbons, which just mean

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.020
carbons bonded in a bunch of
different ways to a bunch of

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.080
different hydrogens.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.980
If you add enough heat for the
reaction to happen-- so its

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.660
activation energy you have to
put it in there with some

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.510
oxygen around-- it's going to
combust and it's going to

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.570
produce carbon dioxide and
water-- and I didn't put it

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.810
here-- and even more heat
than you put into it.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.560
So it's actually an exothermic
reaction.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.980
It produces more heat than
you put into it.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.650
I'll do a lot more of that in
future videos on endothermic

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.230
and exothermic reactions.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.790
But anyway, we care about the
oxidation and the reduction.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.340
So let's see if anyone's getting
oxidized, or anyone is

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.270
getting reduced here.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.110
So let's look at
their oxidation

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.100
numbers, or their states.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.470
Here, carbon is bonded
to 4 hydrogens.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.810
Who's giving, who's taking?

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.120
So let's go to our
Periodic Table.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.660
Carbon is here.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.400
Hydrogen is here.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.520
Carbon is more electronegative.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.840
It's adjacent to the
Three Musketeers of

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.840
electronegativity.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.970
These guys are the most
electronegative.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.730
We always ignore the noble gases
because they pretty much

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.990
don't react at all.

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.310
They're always happy with their
8 valence electrons.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.100
These guys love to
get electrons.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.970
They're small molecules.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.620
Their outermost shell is
close to the nucleus.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.580
They're so close to becoming
noble that they just love

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.900
hogging electrons.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.980
Carbon's almost there.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.200
Carbon's much further to the
right on the periodic table

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.220
than the hydrogen.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.580
So if you have carbon bonding
with hydrogen, carbon is going

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.280
to be the electron hog.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.610
So in the situation,
let's go down here.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.450
So if carbon's the electron hog
and hydrogen is having its

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.170
electrons taken away from it--
remember, this is all kind of

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.950
hypothetical.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.540
It's more partial,
is the reality.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.480
But if you had to pick or
choose, hydrogen's going to

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.280
lose an electron each.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.610
So it's going to have an
oxidation state of plus 1 for

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.830
each hydrogen.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:07.040
You have 4 hydrogens each
giving up an electron.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.010
So the carbon must be
taking 4 electrons.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.710
So its oxidation number
is minus 4.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.320
It's taken 4 electrons so its
charge will go down by 4.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.790
So that's why it's negative.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.670
Fair enough.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.170
What's the oxidation state of
this oxygen right there?

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.700
Well, it's just bonded
to itself.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.530
There's no reason to believe
that 1 oxygen should be able

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.400
to take any electrons
from another oxygen.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.860
So it has a 0 oxidation state.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.140
It's not hogging more than its
fair share of electrons that

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.380
it was essentially born with.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.760
Now.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.040
After the combustion
occurs, what are

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.660
the oxidation numbers?

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.920
Well, I have 2 oxygens
bonded with carbon.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.470
Now we know oxidation
was, to some

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:57.930
degree, named after oxygen.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.210
It is one of the most
electronegative.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.010
Almost anything bonded with
oxygen is going to be giving

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.310
up its electrons.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.480
We also know that oxygen likes
to take 2 electrons.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.780
If it takes 1, it gets here.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.530
If 2, it gets here.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.070
It has a configuration like it
has 8 valence electrons.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.440
So its typical oxidation
number is minus 2.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.350
So carbon, in this in the
situation, each oxygen is

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.180
going to have a minus
2 oxidation number.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.930
The carbon dioxide molecule
is neutral.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.080
So everything has
to add up to 0.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.340
The oxygens, you have 2 of
them, each of them with a

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.880
minus 2 oxidation number.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.390
So that's minus 4.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:46.860
So carbon must be plus 4, which
means that it has given

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.140
up 4 electrons, right?

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.650
Really it only has 4 electrons
to give up.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.480
It has 1, 2, 3, 4 valence
electrons in its second shell,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.100
which is its reactive shell.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.600
So its oxidation number
is plus 4.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.200
Now let's look at the water.

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.480
We've done about a bunch.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.410
When the hydrogens each give up
an electron, they have an

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:10.770
oxidation number of 1.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.310
Each oxygen takes 2 electrons.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:14.110
There's only 1 of them.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.170
So it's minus 2.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.200
So what's going on here?

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.070
What's getting oxidized,
what's getting reduced?

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.250
You have the carbon.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.320
It went from an oxidation number
of minus 4 an oxidation

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.970
number of plus 4.

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:30.250
So let me just draw what's
happening to the carbon.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.070
Carbon goes from minus 4, which
means it's hogging 4

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:41.700
electrons, to a situation where
it's having 4 electrons

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.020
being hogged from it.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.260
It's kind of giving
away 4 electrons.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.450
So someplace in this process,
this guy must have given away

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:50.300
8 electrons.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:51.930
This is a difference
of 8 electrons.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.480
So plus 8 electrons.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.500
So what's happened to carbon?

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.970
Carbon, has it been oxidized
or reduced?

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:04.540
Its charge has gone up.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.690
So it hasn't been reduced.

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.550
Or the other way is that you
can say electrons have been

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.680
taken away from it.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.930
So it has been oxidized.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.590
Now, let's look at the
oxygen itself.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:26.090
Oxygen, over here you have
4 oxygen molecules.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.830
So I'll just write 4 oxygen
molecules here.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.750
And they all have an oxidation
state of 0.

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.130
From an oxidation-number point
of view, they're neutral.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.750
On the side, we have
2, and then we

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.910
have 4 oxygen molecules.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.880
What's their oxidation state?

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.130
They're all minus 2.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.200
So each of these oxygens must
have gained an electron.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.550
So actually, let me let me
re-write this reaction.

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.940
Let me erase a little
bit of it.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.640
Even better, let me just
move this over.

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:12.290
There you go.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.570
Let me fill in that, so
aesthetically it's pleasing.

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:16.720
There you go.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.190
All right.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.560
So we have 4 oxygens with a 0
oxidation state turning into 4

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.110
oxygens with a minus
2 oxidation state.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.650
So each of these 4 oxygens
took 2 electrons.

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:35.110
There's 4 of them, so we must
have gained 8 electrons.

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.640
So what happened to oxygen?

00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.000
It's oxidation state went down,
or its hypothetical

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.300
charge went down, or its
charge was reduced.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:47.255
So this is reduced oxygen.

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.820
What was it reduced by?

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:57.820
It was reduced by the carbon.

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.100
What was the carbon
oxidized by?

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:05.570
It was oxidized by the oxygen,
which oxygen tends to do.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:06.970
It tends to oxidize things.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:10.340
What is the oxidizing agent?

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.410
Well it's the thing that
did the oxidizing.

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:19.150
So the oxygen is the
oxidizing agent.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.150
What is the reducing agent?

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.790
Well it's the thing that
did the reducing?

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.950
It's the reducing agent,
is the carbon.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.320
So you see in this redox
reaction, carbon was oxidized.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.559
It gave away 8 electrons from
this state to that state,

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:36.350
hypothetically, and oxygen
was reduced.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:40.900
Its charge was reduced by a
total of 8 electrons, 2 for

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:42.280
each oxygen.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.380
So its oxidation number
went down.

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.910
Let's do a couple more.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.940
Each of the things that I
wrote-- just to kind of do a

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.790
side-note-- this is called a
half reaction, because I'm

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:53.090
writing just what happened
to the carbon.

00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:56.260
Here I'm writing just what
happened to the oxygen.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.440
I did ignore something.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.880
I did ignore the hydrogen.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.150
I encourage you to
do something like

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:00.830
this with the hydrogen.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.590
But you'll see that
hydrogen was

00:09:02.590 --> 00:09:04.250
neither oxidized or reduced.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:08.220
On both sides of the equation,
all the hydrogens had a plus 1

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:10.050
oxidation state.

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:11.980
Let's do another one.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.440
Here I have another combustion
situation.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.280
This is what happened
to the Hindenburg.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:18.600
They filled a balloon full of
hydrogen because they wanted

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.650
it to float, because hydrogen
is a very light gas.

00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:26.220
Unfortunately, there must have
been a spark in the presence

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.600
of oxygen, and it combusted.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.490
And actually, this is
what is used for a

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.800
rocket fuel as well.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.350
If you have liquid hydrogen--
actually, I don't think they

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:34.680
have liquid hydrogen.

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.330
Well, I don't know enough
about rocket science.

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.130
I'll have to do another video
that in the future.

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.770
But let's look at the
oxidation states.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.750
What's the oxidation state
of hydrogen here, in its

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.050
elemental form?

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:43.750
It's 0.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:45.840
2 hydrogens bonded to each
other, no reason why they

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.340
should hog or be hogged
by another hydrogen.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.210
2 oxygen molecules or atoms
bonded to each other?

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.620
Once again, 0 oxidation state.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.270
Once they combust and
form water, what's

00:09:58.270 --> 00:09:59.200
their oxidation states?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.800
We've done this multiple
times.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.370
The oxygen has a minus
2 oxidation state.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.490
Each hydrogen has a plus 1.

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:08.420
So let's write the
half reactions.

00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.670
We have 2 hydrogens that are
just happy as they are in

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:14.950
neutral state.

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:20.900
They end up being 2 H2's, or
we could have written 4

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.390
hydrogens, either way.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.890
They turn into 2 hydrogen
molecules, because there's

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.150
actually 4 hydrogen atoms, with
a plus 1 oxidation state.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.110
So they must have each given
away 1 electron.

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:36.080
Now, how many total hydrogens
are there?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:37.070
There are 4.

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.890
So we must have given
away 4 electrons.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.410
So this is a half reaction
for hydrogen.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:45.140
Now.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:48.720
Let's do the same thing
for our oxygen.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:51.450
We have some oxygen here.

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:56.060
On the left-hand side, it has
a neutral oxidation state.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:02.580
Then we end up with 2 oxygens
on the right-hand side.

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:06.570
I'll write it like this, 2O,
each with the minus 2

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:07.290
oxidation states.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.500
So each of these oxygens must
have gotten 2 electrons.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:16.890
So it got 2 electrons each,
or it gained 4 electrons.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.900
So what was oxidized?

00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:23.600
Oxidized means that electrons
were taken away from you.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:30.700
The hydrogen was oxidized,
oxidized by oxygen.

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.010
What was reduced?

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:40.820
The oxygen was reduced
by the hydrogen.

00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:43.540
If you actually add these two
reactions up, if you make this

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.450
the left-hand side of your
equation and you make this the

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:50.080
right-hand side of your
equation, you can say, OK,

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.960
let's remove the electrons
from both sides.

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:54.950
Then you'll end up with your
original reaction.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.650
Just to make sure our
terminology is right, what's

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.740
our oxidizing agent?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.960
It's the thing doing
the oxidizing.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.980
It's the oxygen.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.270
What's our reducing agent?

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.860
It's the hydrogen.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.990
Let's do one more.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.530
So here I have iron plus
some hydrochloric acid.

00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:11.660
Let's say this is in an
aqueous solution.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.510
You end up with iron (II)
chloride plus some hydrogen.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.070
So let's do some oxidation
numbers.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:17.870
I'll do it fast this time.

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:19.250
Iron is just by itself.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.370
It's got a 0 oxidation state.

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.860
Hydrogen with chloride,
chloride's a halogen.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:27.130
These guys love to
take electrons.

00:12:27.130 --> 00:12:28.590
They love to take 1 electron.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:32.020
They typically have a minus
1 oxidation state.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.400
So the chlorine is going
to have minus 1.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:38.890
The hydrogen is going
to be plus 1.

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:40.720
You add them together, you get
to a neutral compound.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.890
Fair enough.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.890
Now you go on this side.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:46.480
What is chlorine's
oxidation state?

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.780
Well, once again, it always
likes to take 1 electron.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:50.520
So this is minus 1.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:52.480
But I have 2 chlorines here.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.990
This is a neutral compound.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:57.720
So the iron oxidation state
must be plus 2.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:01.520
What about the hydrogen?

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.790
Now it's just in its
elemental form so

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:04.860
it's going to be neutral.

00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:07.480
So it has a 0 oxidation state.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.580
So what was oxidized?

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:16.450
Our iron went from neutral to
having 2 electrons taken away

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.960
from it, which may give
it a positive charge.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.360
So plus 2 electrons
got taken away.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.610
So this was oxidized.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.890
What about the hydrogen?

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:38.410
The hydrogen went from 2
hydrogens with a plus 1 state,

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:41.770
and essentially, they
went to 2 hydrogen

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:42.720
with a neutral state.

00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.700
So 2 electrons must have been
added to the hydrogens.

00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:50.200
Their charge was reduced.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:52.790
So they were reduced.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.780
What were they reduced by?

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.580
They were reduced by the iron.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:57.890
What was the iron oxidized by?

00:13:57.890 --> 00:14:00.690
It was oxidized by
the hydrogen.

00:14:00.690 --> 00:14:02.190
What about the chlorine?

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.300
The chlorine has a minus 1
oxidation number here.

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:08.130
It has a minus 1 oxidation
number here.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:11.230
It was a neutral relative
to the redox reaction.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:12.860
Anyway, I think you
get the point now.

00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.290
You can do this with a
bunch of reactions.

00:14:14.290 --> 00:14:16.100
But this will give you a little
bit more insight of

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.640
actually what's going
on, and who's

00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:19.120
gaining or losing electrons.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.500
In the future, it will also help
us think about a lot of

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.220
the structures of molecules.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.310
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
