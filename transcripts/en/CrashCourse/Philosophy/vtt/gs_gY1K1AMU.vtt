00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.380
We’ve spent quite a bit of time looking
at arguments for God’s existence.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.180
But we haven’t said much yet about this
God.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.900
Like, what’s he like? Is he a he?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.929
Is he like strictly Marvel superheroes, or
is he more of a DC guy?

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:24.589
Does he prefer his salsa with or without cilantro?
I like corn!

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:26.720
Who’s his favorite Crystal Gem from Steven
Universe?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.300
I guess those kinds of questions would only apply to a heavily personalized and anthropomorphic God.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.200
But the traditional picture of God – the
one accepted, and even assumed, throughout

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.010
Judeo-Christian tradition, up into modern
times – is what we might call an “omni-God,”

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.090
possessing particular divine attributes – the
characteristics believed to be held by God.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.440
Now let’s pause a moment to acknowledge
that this discussion is of one particular God,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.400
the one who stars in Jewish, Christian,
and Muslim scriptures.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.960
Of course, lots of people believe in lots of other gods, and they all have attributes of their own.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.860
We’re focusing on this god because he’s the one
all these philosophers we’ve been studying

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.579
were talking about – he’s the one they
believed – or didn’t believe – in.

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.530
Philosophers like Augustine and Thomas Aquinas
– who were themselves influenced by the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.580
writings of Plato and Aristotle – came up
with a general set of divine attributes that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.810
are still widely held today among theists.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.470
And in this view, God is omniscient, which
means he knows everything that can be known.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.000
And he’s also omnipotent, or all-powerful.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.880
He’s been said to be omnibenevolent, or
possessing perfect goodness.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.340
And he’s omnitemporal and omnipresent – meaning
he exists at all places and all times at once.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.360
Now, it’s worth noting that none of these
attributes is actually mentioned in the Bible.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.820
But philosophers like Aquinas reasoned that
they must be the case, if God is perfect.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.490
And these philosophers took it as a given
that he is.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.640
The problem is, a close investigation of these attributes reveals some rather tricky little puzzles.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.200
No, I take that back.
They’re really, really, big puzzles.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:02.580
[Theme Music]

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.820
Can God create a rock so heavy he can’t
lift it?

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.860
– is just one of an infinite number of unanswerable
questions that can be asked about God.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.200
Like, if God is omnipotent, he has to be able
to create something so heavy he can’t lift it.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.980
Otherwise, his inability to create it would
mean there’s at least one thing he couldn’t do.

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:24.760
But then, he wouldn’t be omnipotent, because if he were truly all-powerful, he’d be able to lift anything.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.520
Quandaries like this come up all the time
when you consider the divine attributes.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.840
And some of the questions that arise are
not only about God, but also about us.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.969
For instance, if God knows everything, then
he also knows the future, right?

00:02:36.969 --> 00:02:41.649
Which makes sense, if he’s also omnitemporal, because that would mean that he’s already in the future.

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.099
And also in the past.
And don’t forget the present.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.020
But many theists also believe that God
gave us free will.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.640
So, how can we be free, if God already knows what
we’re gonna do? In that case, are we really free?

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.020
Or is freedom just an illusion that he created for us, to make us feel like we’re in control?

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.790
What we’re seeing here is that, at least
on the surface, God’s traditional divine

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.120
attributes are internally inconsistent – meaning,
they can’t all be true at the same time.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.690
And what do you do when you hold inconsistent
beliefs?

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.489
Well, if you’re being philosophically rational,
you either give some of them up, or you figure

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:14.810
out a way to understand them that makes them
consistent.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.989
This is what a theist who believes in the
omni-God has to do.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:22.080
Let’s think about the contradiction that
arises from believing the following propositions:

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.430
1) God is omniscient
2) Humans have free will

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.710
Is there any way to resolve this contradiction,
or do we have to surrender one of those beliefs?

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.950
One possible response is to say that knowledge
and causation aren’t the same thing.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.170
So God might know that we’re going to do
something, without actually causing us to do it.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.180
This actually makes sense,
if you think about it.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.920
Imagine a person standing on a cliff looking
down on a train track that curves around a bend.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.900
From her vantage point, the onlooker can
see that, just on the other side of the bend,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.800
a person is stuck on the track as the
train approaches.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.420
Too far away to do anything, the onlooker
knows the accident will happen before it does,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.000
but the fact that she knows it will happen
doesn’t mean that she caused it to happen.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.250
To use a less gruesome example, if God knew
you were going to eat an entire pecan pie

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.570
by yourself over the course of a lonely weekend,
that doesn’t mean that he caused you to do it.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.840
That was all on you.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.780
But wait. If God is omniscient, then he can’t
be wrong, can he?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.959
Because if he was ever wrong, then there would
have been something he didn’t know.

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.759
So if God knew you were going to eat the whole
pie, then you couldn’t not eat the pie,

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.320
because if you decided not to at the last minute,
then you would have just proven God wrong,

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.919
thereby single-handedly stripping him
of his divine omniscience! Good job!

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:33.699
So the knowledge and power of God are, to
say the least, philosophically perplexing.

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:38.159
Now let’s consider another question about
God’s personal skill set: Can God sin?

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.940
If he’s omnipotent, it would seem that he
can, because he can do anything.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.200
But if he’s omnibenevolent, or inherently
good, then it would seem that he can’t.

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.620
This doctrine, which says that God can’t
sin, is known as divine impeccability.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.340
But if God is impeccable and incapable of sin,
then doesn’t that mean that he is not omnipotent?

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.480
After all, I can sin...easily.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.780
I mean, gimme five minutes and I can
probably break two or three commandments.

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.520
Like, the ones about coveting stuff --
not the murdery ones.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.870
But still, it seems kinda weird to think that
I can do something that God can’t.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.509
Some people try to solve this particular puzzle
by saying that sin is necessarily a failure,

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:14.220
so therefore, a perfect being can’t do it.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.420
Others say that, even though God might do
something that would be a sin if a human did it,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.280
the idea of ‘sin’ simply doesn’t apply to God.
Perhaps because, given his omnibenevolence,

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:26.020
everything God does is inherently good.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.840
Now, many philosophers find this solution troubling,
because it kinda makes God’s goodness vacuous.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.169
After all, it basically means that saying
“God did a thing” would be the same thing

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:38.630
as saying “God did a good thing,” because
ipso facto, anything God does is good.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.570
And if that’s the case, then his goodness
doesn’t have any real meaning.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.600
Yet another possible contradiction presents itself in the belief that the omni-God is also a personal God.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.740
Many people find it difficult to suppose that
God could be omnitemporal and omniscient,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.360
yet still have a personal relationship with
his creatures.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.800
It’s hard to understand how God could relate to us – or feel the way we feel –

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.180
if he doesn’t experience time as we do: If he
already knows what’s going to happen,

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.520
how could he ever be surprised,
or change his mind?

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.320
And if god is omnitemporal, is it even possible
that he could be moved to respond to our prayers?

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:12.810
Let’s look at this idea up close in this week’s
Flash Philosophy. To the Thought Bubble!

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.759
When people talk about praying for something
to happen, or to not happen, or are otherwise

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:20.910
making a request of God, they’re making
what are known as petitionary prayers.

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:24.710
When you pray in this way, you’re asking
God for something – to help you pass a test,

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.060
or to save a loved one who’s in danger,
or to make sure the Patriots win the game.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.009
Contemporary American philosopher Eleanor
Stump argues that we have no reason to think

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.039
that asking God for something would actually
make a difference.

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:38.750
She thinks about it like this:
If God knows everything, including the future

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.620
– which he does, if he’s omniscient –

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.820
– and if God has the power to bring about any state of affairs – which he does, if he’s omnipotent –

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.030
– and if he always wants to bring about the best state of affairs – which he does, if he’s omnibenevolent –

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:55.410
– then God has already decided what’s going to happen in every single case. To everyone. Always.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.420
So either your prayer is asking God to do
something he was already going to do, in which

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.680
case your prayer was kind of a waste of time.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.449
Or your prayer is asking God to do something
he has already decided not to do, because

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:08.229
it wasn’t actually the best thing.
Sorry Patriots.

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:11.699
And in that case, even if God would change
his mind, based on your prayer, you wouldn’t

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:15.009
want him to, because it would actually make
things worse than they would’ve been if

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:16.509
you’d just let God do his thing.

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.789
In other words, if God knows what’s best,
why would you want to change his mind?!

00:07:19.789 --> 00:07:23.460
Now, Stump suggests that there might be some
value in the asking, even if the prayer doesn’t

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.900
actually change what’s going to happen.
Maybe you agree with her.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.569
But at this point, it should be clear just
how many problems there are in the divine

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:31.110
attributes, when you think about them. Thanks,
Thought Bubble!

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.660
Thomas Aquinas – the thinker who’s largely
responsible for the traditional divine attributes

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:39.199
we think of today – responded to these sorts
of puzzles by saying that all of this speculation

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:42.650
of What God Is Like is just analogical predication.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.930
Basically, Aquinas said that we can’t
predicate, or assert, anything about God,

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:49.290
because he’s so far beyond our understanding.

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.400
When we speak of God, Aquinas said,
we never say anything that’s true.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.520
Instead, we have to speak entirely in
analogies, because that’s all we can do.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:03.540
So, God isn’t literally our father, for example, but we can understand his role for us as being father-like.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.139
Because that’s as close as we can get to really understanding what what he is.

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:10.860
Or think of it this way: People in south Florida
might say it’s cold when the temperature

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.479
dips into the fifties, but in Alaska, it’s
not cold until it’s well below zero.

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:17.680
But both of those frames of reference are
more similar to each other than they are to

00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:22.760
the cold that is absolute zero, which is about
negative 273 degrees celsius.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.560
You might even say that absolute-zero cold and
negative 10-degree cold are not even the same thing.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.740
But we use the one word – “cold” – to
describe them both, as a kind of analogical

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:36.740
way of talking about something that defies
our complete and personal understanding.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.780
So, Aquinas basically said not to worry about
all of these puzzles, because none of these

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:45.800
things we say about God is more than an approximation
– a little analogue that our tiny little

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.269
minds can come up with, so that we can talk
about an infinite being.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:52.939
Now, there are other thinkers, particularly
in modern times, who point out that none of

00:08:52.939 --> 00:08:58.009
the traditional divine attributes is in the
Bible anyway. So, maybe God isn’t an omni-God.

00:08:58.009 --> 00:09:01.860
Maybe he’s more like a superhero. He can
be way smarter than us, way more powerful

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.730
than us, way more good than us. But still
not perfect.

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:08.279
This seems like sacrilege to a lot of people,
but some philosophers argue that it’s more

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.290
compatible with the God of the Bible.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:14.730
After all, in the Bible, we see God doing
very human things, like walking in the garden,

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.119
getting angry, being surprised, and changing
his mind.

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:22.359
So, it could be possible that God actually
does hate cilantro or is a big fan of Amethyst.

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.280
That’s the kind of stuff that we, as philosophers, get to ponder – kindly and thoughtfully in the comments.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.759
Today we learned about the traditional divine
attributes - omnipotence, omniscience, omnitemporality,

00:09:33.759 --> 00:09:38.399
and omnibenevolence - and the puzzles that
they create for our understanding of God.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:43.760
We also explored some possible solutions to
those puzzles, from Aquinas’ ideas of analogical

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.860
predication, to the work of Eleanor Stump.
