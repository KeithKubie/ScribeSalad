00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
Hey, it's me Destin. Welcome back to SmarterEveryDay.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.179
You might not know this but

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.599
every single hydraulic pump in every car you've probably ever been in

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.600
has a little bitty magnet in it to catch shavings so that the mechanism doesn't foul up.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.599
Now, I know this because when I was growing up both of my parents worked at this plant

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.219
and made steering pumps.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.160
The cool thing about that is that they would bring home the magnets that were out of spec

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.130
and bring them to me and I got to play for hours

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.210
and understand things about how magnets attract and how they repel each other.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.470
So, today I wanna talk about magnets.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.609
Specifically, I want to do a slow motion

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.610
experiment with a little boy named
Garrett who reminds me of my child-like

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.050
fascination with magnets

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.200
and then after that I wanna talk to you about the next great

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.400
manufacturing leap in magnets.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.840
Printable magnets! It's amazing.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.150
Let's go get Smarter Every Day.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.650
Two "Rs" two "Ts"?
[Garrett] Mhm

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.650
[Destin] This is Garrett, two "Rs" two "Ts"

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.150
Hello, Garrett 
[Garrett] Hello, how are you?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.360
[Destin] I am in Connecticut and
Garrett brought something for me to do in slowmo.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.220
What did you bring me, Garrett?

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.560
[Garrett] I brought magnets that,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.000
I don't want to flip them right now 'cause that'll take a long time to redo

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.960
but when you flip one they all turn together

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.860
and almost instantly go back into one
[Destin] And you observed this yourself, right?

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.120
[Garret] Yeah
[Destin] This is something you came up with and you want to do. So, we're going to try in slow motion right?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.880
[Garret] Once I flip this first part over and these are all going to fold over onto it

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.080
Five, four, three, two, one, zero

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.760
[Destin] That was really cool actually, Garrett. That was actually very very cool. (laughter)

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.080
Alright so... (laughter)

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.520
[Destin and Garrett] Whoa...
[Unknown voice] The force is strong with this one.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.160
(laughter)

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.400
[Destin] And you came up with this idea, huh?
[Garrett] Yup

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.480
I was looking at them one day and I was making them into that and I accidentally flipped one and it did that.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.580
[Destin] Really? Alright!
(applause)

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.460
Playing with magnets as a kid was pretty simple:

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.460
You had a north face and a south face and they would align and slap together.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.080
But, now something else is happening.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.360
We're at a company called Polymagnet here in Alabama

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.660
and if you look at their design you kinda get an idea of what they're doing.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.580
They can print specific magnetic designs on the surface of a magnet.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.920
Now, you've never seen anything like this because it's bizarre.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.840
You can get new, unique, crazy,
behaviours just by manipulating that magnetic field.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.840
Let's go check it out.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960
This is Jason Morgan, head of engineering.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.600
He's agreed to teach me about Polymagnets and show me some stuff that most people don't get to see.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.580
[Morgan] So, this is a conventional magnet. 
[Destin] Ok 
[Morgan] So, if you look at the conventional magnet

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.660
[Destin] Wait, hold on, what is this?
[Morgan] This is magnetic viewing film.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.720
[Destin] Magnetic viewing film.
[Morgan] Yes.
[Destin] Ok

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.140
[Morgan] What that does is shows you transition in the magnetic field.
[Destin] Uh-huh

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.700
[Morgan[ So it allows us to see where the magnetic field transitions from north to south.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:01.620
[Destin] Got it, ok.
[Morgan] So, this is a conventional
magnet it's a neodymium magnet.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.119
So, got a north face and a south face and the magnetic field goes from one face around to the other face.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.040
[Destin] Can we draw on the whiteboard?
[Morgan] Absolutely.
[Destin] We'll say this is our magnet here.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.680
[Morgan] Right.
[Destin] So, the field lines are going to go out and in, right?

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:24.520
[David] Yeah, you'll have, you know, closed loop, don't wanna break Maxwell's equations, all the way around from your north pole to your south pole by convention.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.440
[Destin] Gotcha, ok

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.680
[Morgan] So, what we do different is we take a magnet and create pole regions on the surface.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.650
So, we create north and south on the same surface of the magnet

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.410
and what that allows us to do is close that circuit that David was talking about

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.640
in a much more compact space

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.300
and that gives us a stronger field close to the magnet, a stronger force, close..

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:58.820
[Destin] Ok, so, I think I got it. So, what you're saying is if we've got the big loop here north and south

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.830
you're doing the same thing only they're looping much closer together 
[Morgan] Correct
[Destin] Like that?

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:07.590
Even in on itself.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.769
[Morgan] Almost. Right, so, what
actually happens is you have the north and

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:21.521
the south on one face the magnet and so what happens is we have the field go like this and so instead

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.870
of this long field that can create interference and waste energy you have a

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.120
tight field so that it's tightly controlled
and you have the force really focus near the magnet.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.860
[Destin] These people are like modern-day wizards. They can create whatever magnetic field they

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.810
want on any of these magnets.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.310
I sat and talked with him for about an hour

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.340
and came to understand that the way the magnet interacts with the target material

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.500
determines how strong it's attached.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.280
And so what you're saying is the magnetic

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.020
field in this one is going to come up
and around and go all the way back to

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.690
the back of the magnet, correct?
[Morgan] Correct
[Destin] Ok, in this one we have a tighter grouping of the

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.820
magnetic field so the circuits are going
through the steel and they're completing

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.950
just outside of the steel on the other
side, correct?

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.700
[Morgan] On the same face of the magnet
[Destin] Same face of the magnet. So, they're not going all the

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.450
way back around to the back side. Gotcha. Here, I have a very dense spacing of

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.870
magnetic fields and so they're all
completing inside the steel

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.010
[Morgan] Inside the steel, correct

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.890
[Destin] Do I understand magnets?
[Someone off camera] You do. You understand polymagnets.
[Destin] Polymagnets

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.330
Let's say you have a piece of steel that's a certain thickness and you wanna attach this one-inch magnet to it.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.200
Engineers first design and print the magnetic field and input both the magnet and

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.720
the steel into this pull test machine to quantify the exact force versus distance curve.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.160
If they want to they can then change
the magnetic field and tailor it until

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.360
they get the exact force curve they're looking for.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.919
This ability to manipulate the strength of the magnetic field coupled with a really clever geometry allows you

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.319
to create fascinating magnetic behaviors.

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.859
For example, these magnets, they're attracted to each other

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.420
but they don't touch.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.060
They stop just a few millimeters away and seem to hover.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.220
This behavior is what they call a spring.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.000
These are Springs.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.919
Alright this is a spring that's a little bit different it's a little more complex and can be used as a latch.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.780
So, you see that it acts as a spring so if you think about it, let's say, like a

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.680
cabinet door closure. You could have a cabinet door that came together in a soft close with some,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.140
some shock absorption but then you could twist it to lash (Destin gasps) and it holds strong.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.240
[Destin] No way.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:26.240
So, I can pull against you, like that. I
close it and then when I turn it..
[Morgan] Locks into place.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.090
[Destin] That's ridiculous.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.930
Time out! This is way different in your
hands than it is on a video.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.100
Attraction and repulsion in the same axis in then you rotate and you can't pull it apart.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.669
Now we know that any sufficiently mature technology looks like magic until you

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:43.800
understand exactly how it works.

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:48.400
Watch the faces of my highly-educated engineering co-workers as I put this in

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.270
their hands.

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.290
What's going on there?
[Friend] I'm not really sure.
(laughter)

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:55.130
[Friend] That is weird.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.120
How does that work?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.600
[Friend] Ooo it catches.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:02.260
I have no clue.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.560
[Destin] So, if it's not magic how does it work?

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.940
[Morgan] You have that locking point, where it holds tightly, but then you turn past.. (metal clinking)

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.940
and it will hold in that spring location.

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:19.610
[Destin] That's genius.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.690
That's gonna change doorknobs. I really think it is.

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:24.960
Are you excited about that? 
[Morgan] We like this. We like this one a lot.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.320
Jason agreed to let David show me some
of the special machines in the back that

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.500
they invented program magnets. They look just like 3d printers only you load a

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.700
blank magnet and it can create whatever magnetic field you can imagine.

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.940
While we waited the five or so minutes it takes for these things to run, I went back out

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.660
and met more magnet geeks and tried to learn more lingo.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.860
You said a maxel? 
[Magnet Geek] A Maxel.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.240
[Destin] A Maxel is a what?
[Magnet Geek] It's a magnetic pixel

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:51.540
[Destin] Really?
[Magnet Geek] Yep.
[Destin] And so a magnetic pixel would be a node

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:57.330
inside the magnet that's printed. So, the image that you just printed is created

00:07:57.330 --> 00:07:59.490
by magnetic pixels or maxels.
[David] More or less.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:00.530
[Destin] Can we go look at it? 
[David] Oh yeah.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:04.160
Think about these maxels. Somehow this machine creates north and

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.900
south polarized maxels inside the
magnet.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.140
You can add these pixels up to basically make images that can create forces.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.680
If you couple one image with a complimentary image

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.740
you can then create incredible three-dimensional behaviours.

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:21.440
This technology is so new there hasn't even been enough time to think through all the different applications.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.180
I think it's a game-changer. I'd love to hear what you think in the

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:28.360
comments and please consider passing this video along to all your smart friends to see what they think.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:31.620
So this is the Smarter Every Day magnet.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.980
[Morgan] Yeah so we'll..

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:38.900
[Destin] Oh man!

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.060
So, you could make a marble track. Could you do that? 
[Morgan] Give me a big enough magnet. (laughter)

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:49.940
[Destin] This is bizzare. Alright so here we go, Smarter Every Day.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:54.660
We have a marble,

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.660
And it follows the field lines.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.920
So, there you go.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.950
The entire foundation of magnetic
circuit design technology just changed.

00:09:01.950 --> 00:09:06.590
I'm not gonna lie it makes me look at
magnets just like I did when I was a little kid.

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:12.880
Okay, my parents worked at that
plant growing up to support the family.

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.750
I choose to be an engineer and make
YouTube videos at night so let's don't

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:20.120
make this part weird because you're
smart people you know how this works.

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.710
Smarter Every Day is supported by
audible.com and I would love it if you

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.150
decided to support audible so they wanted to continue supporting Smarter Every Day.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.490
You know what's going on.

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:33.120
Oh wait! Look at this! A printed magnet telling you the promo code. If you want to get a free

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.780
audio book of your choice

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:39.650
go to audible.com/smarter I actually
use this I'm not just telling you to do

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:43.230
something because you know they support Smarter Every Day. This is something that

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.040
will actually make you smarter every day so if you wanna support Smarter Every Day go to

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:52.520
audible.com/Smarter to get a book of your choice. I would like that. Also I wanna thank Polymagnets,

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.920
the group that actually makes
these things, for printing all the crazy stuff this is

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:01.080
an untapped potential. The medical field? What could they use this technology for?

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.550
It's pretty impressive. Anyway go to check out their website they have some really cool

00:10:04.550 --> 00:10:06.210
features on there. That's it.

00:10:06.210 --> 00:10:10.610
If this earned your subscription feel free to do that but if not I just want you to get smarter every day.

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.860
I'm Destin. Have a good one.
