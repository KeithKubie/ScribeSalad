00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:04.760
In order to look at planning in detail, let us consider this problem that we

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.940
have encountered earlier. This is a blocks world, in which there is

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.900
a robot which has to move the blocks from the current state, to the goal state.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.380
The robot has only one arm, so it can move only one block at a time.

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.800
It can move only a block which does not have some other block on top of it.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.005
Earlier, when we considered this method, we had looked at weak AI methods like

00:00:26.005 --> 00:00:29.925
means-ends analysis. Now we're going to look at more systematic,

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:35.970
knowledge-based methods. One question unanswered in our previous discussion was,

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.090
how can we find which goal to select, among the various goals that are here?

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.310
They simply said, the agent might select a goal.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.310
Now we will look at how the agent can in fact do the goal composition and

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:50.720
select the right goal to pursue?
