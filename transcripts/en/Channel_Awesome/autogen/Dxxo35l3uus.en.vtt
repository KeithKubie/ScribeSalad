confusing and complicated again I guess

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090
confusing and complicated again I guess
 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.550
confusing and complicated again I guess
the reason that all this happened is

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560
the reason that all this happened is
 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.110
the reason that all this happened is
because Flynn while staying in the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:14.120
because Flynn while staying in the
 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.270

religion all that stuff this is what
 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.450
religion all that stuff this is what
caused the big split between Flynn and

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
caused the big split between Flynn and
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.969
caused the big split between Flynn and
the CLU and the race is on to who can

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979
the CLU and the race is on to who can
 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.149
the CLU and the race is on to who can
have total control of everything to take

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159
have total control of everything to take
 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.940
have total control of everything to take
over the world or something like that

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950
over the world or something like that
 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.980
over the world or something like that
like I said it gets weird and

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
like I said it gets weird and
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.590
like I said it gets weird and
complicated and let's face it that's not

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600
complicated and let's face it that's not
 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.690
complicated and let's face it that's not
the kind of movie this is this movie is

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700
the kind of movie this is this movie is
 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.940
the kind of movie this is this movie is
here to be a straightforward

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950
here to be a straightforward
 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.170
here to be a straightforward
action-adventure with cool effects and a

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180
action-adventure with cool effects and a
 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.080
action-adventure with cool effects and a
unique design and yeah that's pretty

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090
unique design and yeah that's pretty
 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.120
unique design and yeah that's pretty
much what we got I give it credit for

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130
much what we got I give it credit for
 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.760
much what we got I give it credit for
tapping on some of these ideas but they

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
tapping on some of these ideas but they
 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.410
tapping on some of these ideas but they
don't really follow all the way through

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420
don't really follow all the way through
 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.600
don't really follow all the way through
with it or if they do it's in a story

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610
with it or if they do it's in a story
 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.490
with it or if they do it's in a story
that's way too complicated to understand

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500
that's way too complicated to understand
 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.800
that's way too complicated to understand
I guess in a way it is very much like

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810
I guess in a way it is very much like
 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.660
I guess in a way it is very much like
the first one as it is hard to follow

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670
the first one as it is hard to follow
 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.420
the first one as it is hard to follow
but with the first one it was tied in

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430
but with the first one it was tied in
 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.039
but with the first one it was tied in
much more to the story on what was going

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049
much more to the story on what was going
 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.830
much more to the story on what was going
on here it's just sort of more of a side

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840
on here it's just sort of more of a side
 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.690
on here it's just sort of more of a side
event while the rest of the movie is

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700
event while the rest of the movie is
 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.039
event while the rest of the movie is
busy making excuses to have fights

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049
busy making excuses to have fights
 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.289
busy making excuses to have fights
but they're fun fight sequences and

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299
but they're fun fight sequences and
 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:16.819
but they're fun fight sequences and
there's a lot of great visuals is a

great action no but I will give a credit
 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.500
great action no but I will give a credit
for having a very unique design that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510
for having a very unique design that
 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.780
for having a very unique design that

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
adds on top of the original tron film
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.059

you do look at this universe a yes this
is still Tron but at the same time

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:27.749
is still Tron but at the same time
 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.119
is still Tron but at the same time
they've really updated it

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129
they've really updated it
 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:31.429
they've really updated it
it isn't just cleaning up the effects it

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439
it isn't just cleaning up the effects it
 

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:33.229
it isn't just cleaning up the effects it
is still giving it its very unique look

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239
is still giving it its very unique look
 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.119
is still giving it its very unique look
like if you were to put on Tron and then

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129
like if you were to put on Tron and then
 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.920
like if you were to put on Tron and then
Tron Legacy you could clearly tell which

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930
Tron Legacy you could clearly tell which
 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.559
Tron Legacy you could clearly tell which
one was which so for me I think the film

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569
one was which so for me I think the film
 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.789
one was which so for me I think the film
is OK

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799
is OK
 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.009
is OK

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019
I wasn't expecting much and I got
 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:44.300
I wasn't expecting much and I got
actually a little bit more than I

expected at least with the visuals in
 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.409
expected at least with the visuals in
the action but anyone hoping for some

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419
the action but anyone hoping for some
 

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.089
