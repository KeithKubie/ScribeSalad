00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:01.602
Okay.

00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:03.971
Let us know in the comments
if you know where my keys are.

00:00:03.971 --> 00:00:05.873
I am locked out of my apartment
and my landlord said

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:07.374
I cannot sleep
in the hallway again.

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:08.642
And cut.

00:00:08.642 --> 00:00:10.744
Great job, guys.
I missed most of the show,

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.779
because there's free pizza
in the conference room.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.215
Oh yeah, Ryan, I can only assume
that your knees were too pointy.

00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:19.386
Again, so smooth them out
somehow. That's it.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:21.722
Is there still pizza?

00:00:21.722 --> 00:00:23.557
I mean, yeah,
but you better hurry.

00:00:23.557 --> 00:00:26.560
You know how people get around
here when there's free pizza.

00:00:51.051 --> 00:00:51.752
Oh yeah.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.866
Oh my god.
I'm telling HR.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.036
This is why I pack
a lunch, bitch.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:15.676
Hit him!

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.526
Nate? I'm the boss now.

00:01:32.526 --> 00:01:34.962
Also, dude, culturally
insensitive costume.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.303
My eyes. I can't see.
Sticky note! I can't see!

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:55.415
Oh, ow.

00:01:59.453 --> 00:02:01.154
There it is.
The conference room.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.080
Ew, all that's left is veggie.

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:29.483
Gross, never mind.

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.054
Anybody seen Name tag Tay?
He loves veggie.
