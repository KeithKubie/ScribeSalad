00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.280
History has a long and rich tradition of apocalyptic
predictions – all of which were wrong – yet

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.120
some people still think that this time ’round
in 2012 is the real deal.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.310
Why 2012?

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.190
Because of ancient Mayan calendars.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.219
Obviously.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.770
Mayan calendars not only recorded the days
and years, but also longer cycles of about

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.770
5 Millennia.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.550
So they could easily make calendars that went
1,000s of years into the future.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.820
But, of course, 1,000s of years in the future
from 1,000s of years ago brings us to current

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.490
times when the Mayan calendars stop in 2012.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.100
Modern new-agey people decided that the wise
Mayans stopped making calendars because they

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.830
knew when the world would end.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.800
And because new agers are happy – though
scientifically illiterate – people their

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.410
vision of 2012 was a great spiritual awakening
or world reboot or other hippy-consciousness-expanding

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.440
nonsense that the Mayans, who spent time puling
strings of thorns through peoples’ tongue,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.040
probably didn’t have in mind.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.870
To a normal person the thought that: calendar
finishes therefore end of the world is an

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.620
odd conclusion to draw.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.469
After all, the amount of time in the Universe
is infinite and the amount of stone is limited.

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.880
So, at some point the Mayans had to stop carving
calendars.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:02.880
But never mind.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.170
What should have stayed a fringe belief turned
into mass hysteria with the 2012 disaster

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.610
movie that swept the academy awards and the
numerous emmy-nominated apocalypse documentaries

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.050
on
::sigh::

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.770
The History Channel.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.440
What happened to you guys?

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.440
Anyway.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.770
After this NASA became so inundated with questions
that they had to take time away from their

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
busy robot building, frontier pushing, knowledge
expanding, civilization inspiring schedule,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.720
to write a webpage explaining that no, a human-sacrificing,
stone-age society with neither wheels to pull

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.470
carts nor glass to make telescopes, didn’t
know more about science at the dawn of history

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.550
than real scientists do today.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:38.750
But the parade of crazy marched on anyway
making wilder and wilder predictions for Earth

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.270
including:
• Geomagnetic Reversal (a process that unfolds

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.479
on a geologic timescale, not a single day)
• A collision with mysterious Planet X (That

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.580
no astronomers have found)
• A local star going supernova (Despite

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.399
there being no such candidates)
• An Alien Invasion (Which is ludicrous

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:53.450
on the face of it… or is it?)

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.090
• And a galactic synchronization beam, whatever
the hell that is.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.690
A sane person, at this point, would wonder
how the Mayans were able to predict astro-physical

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.080
anomalies thousands of years in advance and
millions of miles away yet didn’t foresee

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.110
the Spanish coming across the Atlantic.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.970
And that’s because the Mayans never predicted
apocalypse.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.780
The only people to claim the Mayans knew about
the end of the world were distinctly not Mayans.�
