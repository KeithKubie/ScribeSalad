00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.070
Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Today I'm at the Tambopada Research Center,

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.100
it's run by Rainforest Expeditions, and we're gonna calculate the force that a

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.120
grasshopper uses to jump with. First thing we're gonna do is we're going to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.150
weigh the grasshopper. So this envelope, we're gonna zero

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.170
our scale, so.. and then put the grasshopper

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.180
in the envelope, so you know force = mass x acceleration

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.190
so we are going to figure out the mass of the grasshopper

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.190
and we're gonna use this high speed camera to calculate the acceleration

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.220
of the grasshopper. So how much does our... wait we weren't, yeah we were...

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.240
0.1 gram? That sound right,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.270
Mr entomologist?
- Sounds about right.
- Alright. Now we gotta measure a length of his leg

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.280
so if you can measure any feature that we can get. We'll do

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.310
this in millimeters. That's the long skinny one on the back?
- Yep, so

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:08.340
that is called the tibia just like with us.
- It's a tibia just like us?

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.380
- Yep
- So what do you have, looks like 15mm?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.420
- Yeah.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.450
(Destin) Got it. [laugh] That was fast, I got it.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.980
[music]

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.490
Camera ready.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:32.520
- 3.. 2.. 1..

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.590
(Destin) Got it.
- Oh yeah!
 - Alright so now we're gonna calculate

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.630
what its acceleration rate was. We're going to basically plot

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.680
how fast he went based on that measurement from his femur and his tibia right?

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.730
- Yeah.
- Alright and we'll figure out how much force a grasshopper leg has.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.730
I recorded two high speed videos of grasshoppers hopping in the Amazon.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.760
I'm gonna calculate the acceleration of one, and if you so choose you can calculate the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.790
acceleration for the second one. Only take a couple of minutes and I know you're smart enough. The first thing you're gonna do

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.810
is download some software called tracker. Links below. All you do is

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.820
get tracker and you import a video file from the grasshopper hopping

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.860
Once you have it in there now we have to set our scale factor. All you do

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.920
is wait till the grasshopper's hopping so that his leg is stretched out

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.940
in the plane that the camera's looking at. Once you get to that point you simply

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.960
create the ratio by clicking the gauge length of his leg

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.970
and setting it to 15mm. After that you go back to the initial frame.

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.990
And at this point we're going to select a track point about his eye.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.020
The reason we use the eye is because it has good contrast with the background. At this point

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.070
we can set the track point and begin to play the file and create a velocity vs

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.080
time curve of the grasshopper hopping out of the screen. Once we

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.110
have this velocity vs time curve all we have to do is create the slope of this

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.130
line and that's acceleration. Derivative simply means

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.160
slope of the tangent line. That's what we've done here. The derivative of velocity is acceleration.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.170
So once we have this slope of the line you can see right there

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.200
the acceleration of this grasshopper is just over 400 metres per second squared.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.220
Now all we have to do is use force = mass x acceleration and you can

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.260
calculate the force that a grasshopper pushes against stuff when it hops.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.270
But wait a second. Think about this. We calculated the force that his legs are putting out based on jumping

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.300
off of a rigid surface. What if he's on grass? I mean he's a grasshopper

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.340
after all. That grass or a leaf or something would have to push away because it has to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.370
give, it's not rigid. That means the velocity at which he accelerates

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.420
away when he hops is directly affected by the rigidity of whatever

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.440
he's hopping off of. I have never thought about that. You probably haven't either

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.460
Anyway, so grasshoppers literally live and die based on

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.490
what they're hopping away from. That's amazing. OK if you're not to lazy go grab that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.520
tracker software, and get that second hop video file from the video description,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.540
calculate the instantaneous velocity of that grasshopper as he hops out of the screen, back out the

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.570
acceleration and then from there calculate the force on the grasshopper legs.

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.590
Should be pretty fun. Leave me a comment, tell me what value you get, see if it compares to

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.640
the first number we got. Ready for grasshopper launch?
(Son) Yes sir.
(Destin) OK Here you go..

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.670
5..4..3..2..1.. Go. [bang]

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.680
[laugh] Try it on the floor this time. Set it up.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.690
OK this week on Smarter Every Day I'm gonna recommend an audible.com

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.720
book which is Wicked Bugs by Amy Stuart.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.770
You know audible is a sponsor for Smarter Every Day so you help Smarter Every Day out if you go download a free audio book

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.790
at audible.com/smarter. Anyway this one's about all kinds of crazy bugs

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.850
and how they've interacted with humans throughout the years. You may recognise some of the names

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.880
of the bugs from Smarter Every Day. Brown Recluse, Brazillian Wandering Spider, things like that.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.900
Anyway, audible.com/smarter and you'll help Smarter Every Day, and you'll get a free audio book.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.930
It's really a win-win. You ready for launch?
- Yessir.
 - OK Ready?

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.940
Think you can hit the ceiling this time?
- Yes sir.
- 5..4..3..

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.970
2..1.. Go!

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.980
That was good. Anyway,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.010
shouldn't you be calculating the acceleration of a grasshopper jump right now? Anyway,

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.040
audible.com/smarter. Thank you very much for your support. Getting Smarter Every Day.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.068
Have a good one.
