the sources pain you can use fault up
 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.089
the sources pain you can use fault up
for all down increment or decrement x

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099
for all down increment or decrement x
 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.600
for all down increment or decrement x
value 1 you can also use all page up or

probably used to inspecting an element
and then going to these Styles pains

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230
and then going to these Styles pains
 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.380
and then going to these Styles pains
actually go and play around with values

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390
actually go and play around with values
 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.509
actually go and play around with values
well you can go and find a property to

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519
well you can go and find a property to
 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640
well you can go and find a property to
work with and similar to what you're

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
work with and similar to what you're
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.560
work with and similar to what you're
used to you can still use the up and

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570
used to you can still use the up and
 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.350
used to you can still use the up and
down keys to increment or decrement x

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
down keys to increment or decrement x
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.290
down keys to increment or decrement x
value 1 you can also now increment x

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
value 1 you can also now increment x
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.479
value 1 you can also now increment x
value 10 or decrement using shift up or

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489
value 10 or decrement using shift up or
 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.340
value 10 or decrement using shift up or
shift down and using shift page up or

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350
shift down and using shift page up or
 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.380
shift down and using shift page up or
ship page down you can increment or

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390
ship page down you can increment or
 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.470
ship page down you can increment or
decrement x value of a hundred and

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480
decrement x value of a hundred and
 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.150
decrement x value of a hundred and
finally those ultra specific properties

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160
finally those ultra specific properties
 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790
finally those ultra specific properties
you can use alt up and on down to

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800
you can use alt up and on down to
 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.619
you can use alt up and on down to
increment or decrement x value of

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
increment or decrement x value of
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.350
increment or decrement x value of
certain point one
