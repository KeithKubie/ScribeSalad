00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:02.250
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So Andy, how'd you do on that one?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.382
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I did okay, but I could have sworn the truck in the back was the biggest.

00:00:05.382 --> 00:00:08.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; I know those were really tough. So how does this depth stuff work?

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.436
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; well, I think I understand binocular cues that Susan was talking about, these

00:00:12.436 --> 00:00:14.762
cues that require two eyes.

00:00:14.762 --> 00:00:17.161
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; basically it's the same way that 3D movies work.

00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.834
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; What do you mean by that?

00:00:18.834 --> 00:00:22.196
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; So, basically our brain's getting two different pictures. It takes the two

00:00:22.196 --> 00:00:25.094
different images, one from each eye, processes them and interprets them as

00:00:25.094 --> 00:00:26.189
depth.
