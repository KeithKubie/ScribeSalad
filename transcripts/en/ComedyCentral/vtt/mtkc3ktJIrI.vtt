00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt;  Like not having
to work on Labor Day?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.630
Or not having to go
to school on Labor Day?

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.950
Why you reading, bitch?

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.610
Of course!
Unless you're a freak.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.410
But while you're watching
this...
Change the channel.
...and avoiding small talk

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.940
at your neighbor's barbecue...
Now that's a hot dog!

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.900
...or at your co-worker's
awful party...

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.710
It's really great to be here.
There’s nothing like a party.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.080
...raise your light beer...
Mmm-mmm, bitch!

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.850
...to the group
who made this day possible.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.740
Hooray!
Unions!

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.780
FYI: Labor
Day started as a day of protest

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.700
&gt;&gt; and now it celebrates
the labor unions

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.770
that fight for workers’ rights.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.070
Without these rights, all of
our jobs would suck way more.

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.760
Abbi, could you clean up
all the sweat?

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.120
It's actually my lunch break.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.980
Good call. It'll totally be here
when you get back.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.960
Imagine your life
without the eight-hour workday.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.320
How long have we been here?
Could be years. Paid time off.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.820
You guys could stand
a little vacation yourselves.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.880
Look how tired Tim looks.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.840
That's just the shape
of my face, sir.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.050
Workplace safety regulations.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.380
I just realized I'm supposed
to meet a friend for lunch.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.490
Child labor laws.
And my knees are intact,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.620
so I make
a perfect ottoman.

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.330
Sick leave.
Ohhh...

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.430
And the freakin’ weekend!
Yay!

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.080
Basically I'm trying to cram
my entire life into 48 hours

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.340
and I won’t enjoy
a second of it.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.290
The fight was never easy.
You're going to jail.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.640
And it certainly isn't over.
Viva la revolucion!

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.910
But it’s everyone's fight.
So don't be a dick. He did it!

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.330
Did he? Yes, he did!
And use today to say:

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.370
“Thank you, unions!”
Really. Definitely. Totally.
