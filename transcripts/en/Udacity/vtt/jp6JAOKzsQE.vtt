00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.480
So there are a number of other
monetization methods out there and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.120
I brought a list of them,
just because there's a huge number and

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.189
I want to make sure that I'm
not leaving important ones out.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.050
I left this to the end because

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.020
the performance is really going to vary
app to app, where some of the other

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.530
monetization methods that we went
over are a little bit more common.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.510
Firstly, there are surveys.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.530
This is where you're offering
players in game rewards.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.420
Generally for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.100
branded surveys, what's your favorite
soft drink, things like that.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.480
There are also real world rewards.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.878
So this is the most popular case for

00:00:35.878 --> 00:00:41.007
this would be if somebody maybe gets
level four in whatever your game is and

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:45.970
they get a reward for free Kleenexes or
something like that that they can

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.650
them redeem at a real world location or
order to their house.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.590
There's also Affiliate or Ecommerce.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.620
So I've seen with a lot of cases,
particularly games and apps that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.720
are extremely well designed or arted,
that sometimes they'll sell prints

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.150
of popular characters or
other elements directly to players.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.540
In some cases they'll direct them to
other App Stores and thinks like that,

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.110
that they can purchase this.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.760
And in a lot of cases you can

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.790
get affiliate revenue which is
a percentage of the users purchase.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.660
Even if they're not purchasing whatever
you're directing them to, which is key.

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.960
So if you send them to the App Store and
within 24 hours they make a purchase

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.670
of another game, you'll get
a very small percentage of that.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.736
If you have a wide enough audience base,
this adds up which is really cool.

00:01:40.736 --> 00:01:44.054
There are also things
like notification ads,

00:01:44.054 --> 00:01:47.610
little pop-up notifications, text ads.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.767
There are things such as
offer walls that were for

00:01:50.767 --> 00:01:55.160
I guess, like the beginning of
the App Store, extremely popular.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.117
And that's where you're offering
players the ability again,

00:01:59.117 --> 00:02:03.658
to get in game rewards, if they either
download and install other games or

00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:07.908
if they complete offers for
subscriptions to magazines or Netflix or

00:02:07.908 --> 00:02:11.210
something like that which
is extremely popular.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.670
Finally, there are app walls which
is like a hybrid of offer wall and

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.070
banner ad unit, where you display
a list of different games or apps.

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.250
Perhaps some of them you own,
some of them you don't own, and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.240
players can pick and
choose what they want to download.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.590
There's a whole range here and

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.390
it really depends on what
converts best within your game.
