00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.010
Here's the water cycle model. Which you were

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:05.360
likely taught years ago while in school. As

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.310
you can see, it explains that water in

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.330
the oceans evaporates. Forms clouds. And then goes

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.170
back to earth as rain, ice or snow.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.270
And eventually, through rivers and streams, the water

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.480
goes back into the ocean. This conceptual model

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.580
is a highly simplified explanation. But for most

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.610
purposes, it's efficient. People form conceptual models all

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.770
the time. And it's the responsibility of the designer,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.070
to help the person form a useful conceptual model.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.190
It doesn't have to be complete. It can be

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.220
an approximation. But, it has to be usable.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.440
In the absence of clues from the designer. The

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.390
person is very likely to develop an inaccurate model.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.650
Which means they will eventually be confused. For your

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.850
next exercise, find a reasonably complex activity that

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.070
you frequently do. And explain your conceptual model

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.770
for it. You may use a combination of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.260
text or drawings. Organization of your kitchen, how you

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.800
sort things in your room. Or the operation

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.280
of the equipment in your entertainment center. Are all

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.150
good examples of everyday situations, that can be

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.720
amazingly difficult to explain to others. You can use

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.030
one of these examples, or choose one of your own.
