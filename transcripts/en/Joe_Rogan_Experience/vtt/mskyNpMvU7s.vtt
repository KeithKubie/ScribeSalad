8
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.120
I'll go up,
bitches.
Here we go.

9
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.630
The Joe Rogan Experience

10
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.640
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

11
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.570
<v 1>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

12
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:55.571
in this amazing moment in human history where not only was a prince wed,

13
00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.280
but a couple days later and evil warlord was killed.

14
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.930
We are in the middle of an awesome movie.

15
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.130
That's what's going on.
We have a black president.

16
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.850
Princes are getting married in front of billions of people.

17
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.910
Everyone is happy for them and we killed the bad guy who was living in squalor

18
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.760
in Pakistan.
I'll tell you what,

19
00:01:22.761 --> 00:01:25.850
I thought 1 million bucks would buy you a little bit more in Pakistan.

20
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.370
I thought for 1 million bucks you could own Pakistan.

21
00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.040
I didn't know you would get that shit a whole house.
You're like,

22
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:34.070
this is a sound been lots of million dollar compound in Afghanistan.

23
00:01:34.071 --> 00:01:38.660
Like what the fuck is it just like the most fertile heroin ground in the world?

24
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.060
I mean,
what the fuck is that?
Why is that house worth 1 million bucks?

25
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.110
<v 0>It's probably,
I think it was built exactly to hide him.</v>

26
00:01:44.111 --> 00:01:48.220
So I think it was probably a large underground bunker type situation or it was,

27
00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:52.810
had a lot of security and a lot of firewalls and stuff like that.
And maybe,

28
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.710
I don't know,

29
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.440
I was thinking that they're going to find him and fucking like woodland hills or

30
00:01:56.441 --> 00:01:57.070
something like that.

31
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.690
[inaudible] you surprised that that they found him in Pakistan?
Yeah,
I was too.

32
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:02.524
It seems like you would have,

33
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.850
<v 1>well,
the thing about that,
dude,
I think he's,
he's gotta be around his kind,</v>

34
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.200
you know he's gotta be around militants only,
right?
You can't no,

35
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.950
no moderate people are going to be like,
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.020
That's Osama bin.
Ladin okay.
You know,
we're,
we're not,

37
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.120
we're not talking about Muhammad here.
We're not talking about another,

38
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.510
the guy that wrote the Quran,

39
00:02:21.511 --> 00:02:25.500
we were talking about this guy who's probably the head of a gigantic terrorist

40
00:02:25.501 --> 00:02:30.350
organization and he used to work for the CIA bin.
Ladin did,
Huh?

41
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.690
Putting one was working for the CIA.
You didn't know that?
No,
I didn't know that.

42
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.960
<v 0>Who says that?
Everybody?
Yeah.
Oh wait,
no,
I think he did.</v>

43
00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.100
He had some kind of you in the mail room.

44
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:45.050
He had an agreement with a wet president was at the original Bush or something

45
00:02:45.051 --> 00:02:46.520
like that.
I do remember that.

46
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.260
Barely remember some kind of like training you set up for some kind of training.

47
00:02:51.261 --> 00:02:51.410
Well,

48
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.000
there's all sorts of allegations that the bottom line is that the United States,

49
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.860
the CIA,
the whatever the fuck you want to call them,
whatever under

50
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
<v 1>what they did was they got all these people in Afghanistan to fight against the</v>

51
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.320
Soviet Union and they help them.
They help the Mujahideen,
they help train them,

52
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:14.770
they help arm them.
And Osama bin Laden was a part of that.

53
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.400
And when the Soviet Union got out of Afghanistan and you know,

54
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:23.650
whatever happened overseas that shifted,
you know,

55
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:26.590
the Taliban and al Qaeda has interest in,
you know,

56
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:29.650
taking out the United States instead of taking out Russia instead of defending

57
00:03:29.651 --> 00:03:31.990
themselves.
When,
when,
when shit got weird with Afghanistan,

58
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:36.760
that's when homeboy came into the picture and then he basically took over over

59
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.330
there supposedly who the fuck knows,
you know,

60
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.220
when you start talking about what the CIA did and you know,

61
00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:46.510
and do what they're doing,
the conscious and the Sandinistas are you sure?

62
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.170
Because you know they've been lying about everything for so long.

63
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:55.060
Who the fuck knows if Osama bin Ladin Really Alex Jones thinks he's been dead

64
00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:55.894
for nine years.

65
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.300
<v 4>The nine years ago froze him and they're pulling him out right strategically in</v>

66
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:04.800
line for when the new elections are setting up.

67
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.000
See what they did was they threw out this bogus birth certificate.

68
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.230
<v 1>Have you seen the bogus birth certificate?
Oh,
you mean the pdf?
It's fake.</v>

69
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.170
Yeah,
totally.
What people need to know.

70
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:21.700
I asked a thread about this last night and the general consensus among people

71
00:04:21.701 --> 00:04:23.050
who understand Photoshop,

72
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.400
I put up a thread on the message board asking Photoshop Wizards,

73
00:04:27.401 --> 00:04:31.900
please check this thing out and tell me what's up.
And there's a bunch of v.

74
00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.240
What people don't know is a lot of people are claiming Osama bin or Natto sambal

75
00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.970
up.
Isn't it weird that the president's name is right next to this evil evil

76
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.160
terrorists?
You think you would change his name?

77
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.820
I mean Kevin James Chen changed his name.
His name was Nick [inaudible].

78
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.370
Nick thing nip thing like with a k nothing wrong with that.

79
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.610
Just a complicated name to spell it.

80
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:54.280
He didn't want to go the Arnold Schwarzenegger take a chance route.

81
00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.080
So like Jeff Ross wasn't Jeff Ross like Jeff Lip Schulz or something like that,

82
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.530
right and red band.
That red band.
Yeah.
There you go.
That red band guy,

83
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.980
he was like some Nazi name or something like that.
Well,
maybe,

84
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.370
maybe it would draw more attention to the fact like if Obama had changed his

85
00:05:09.371 --> 00:05:14.320
name before running for president to Luther or,
well,
for poor white people,

86
00:05:14.321 --> 00:05:18.010
he is such a nightmare because his nickname,
his middle name is Hussein.
Yeah.

87
00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.380
It's like he couldn't be more fucked up.
His name,

88
00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.300
his name couldn't be more threatening.

89
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:26.350
It is weird for dumb white people that must be so terrorizing,
you know,

90
00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.260
just fuck,
fuck,
fuck.
Anyway,
for people don't know,

91
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.320
supposedly he faked his birth certificate and what they did was people took the

92
00:05:34.901 --> 00:05:38.680
image that the White House released online and they took the image and they ran

93
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:42.700
it through Photoshop or Adobe photo elements and they saw that there were many

94
00:05:42.701 --> 00:05:47.620
layers to the photograph and the photograph wasn't just one flat photograph that

95
00:05:47.621 --> 00:05:51.820
things had been added supposedly or that it looked like things had been cut and

96
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.480
paste,

97
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.480
but the general consensus among people who understand photoshops seems to be

98
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.040
that

99
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.210
<v 5>when you scan something and you put it on in Adobe Photoshop,</v>

100
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.650
it shows layers automatically.
OCR character recognition thing.

101
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:10.640
What it does is it tries to grab the,
the words then you know,

102
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.160
and puts them in layers for whatever reason.
I don't know why it does it.

103
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.430
Why was it annoying?
Yeah.
It might have a standardize it all the time.

104
00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.061
It's annoying.

105
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.420
But you would think that people would ask about this before they would make all

106
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:23.240
these crazy claims that it's definitely fake because look,

107
00:06:23.241 --> 00:06:26.750
it's probably fake anyway.
You know,
who's the sec with the fucking knows.

108
00:06:26.751 --> 00:06:30.920
Who Cares?
It's,
it's anti American to care.
Okay.

109
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.771
What do you saying you're,

110
00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:36.110
you should be able to be American because you somehow or another snuck in first.

111
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:40.340
You both got in.
Yeah.
Way in through the channels that we all agreed upon.

112
00:06:40.341 --> 00:06:43.000
Did you really agree on those channels?
Because I didn't agree on them.
Right.
I,

113
00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:46.700
I think we can do a lot better when deciding who gets to stay here and who

114
00:06:46.701 --> 00:06:49.910
doesn't.
I know a lot of cool people that want to come here and can't write,

115
00:06:49.911 --> 00:06:54.350
you know,
and there's cons here.
Plenty of them.
Um,
so who gives a fuck?

116
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:57.710
We're all immigrants.
The United States is based on the idea of immigration.

117
00:06:57.711 --> 00:07:00.980
Come to someplace from someone that sucks and let's make this place better.

118
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.600
That's the whole thing.
That's the whole thing.

119
00:07:02.601 --> 00:07:05.960
That is when the United States is so when people start fucking tripping about,

120
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:08.510
he wasn't really born here like you,

121
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:13.160
you have to be shit out on the right patch of dirt to make you eligible to run

122
00:07:13.161 --> 00:07:16.010
it.
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

123
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.240
Both regardless whether or not you think it's stupid.
It is the law.

124
00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.380
It is the constitution.
It is by our founding fathers.

125
00:07:24.381 --> 00:07:27.350
They had the great wisdom when setting up this nation.

126
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.740
Great Wisdom.
They were dumb as fuck.
And they had wooden teeth.
Okay.

127
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.980
And slaves and they were fucking their slaves.
Were they really?

128
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:41.620
<v 6>Oh yeah.
Tell Thomas Jefferson was fucking a slave.</v>

129
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:46.540
That's,
yeah,
like it wasn't just like they were just,
you know,

130
00:07:46.541 --> 00:07:49.690
happen to have slaves because that's what some people say that,
you know,

131
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:50.700
back then it was a,

132
00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.100
that was normal and they were just doing what was normal and they didn't like
it.

133
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:56.710
But,
um,
what about fucking your slave?

134
00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.750
<v 5>Well do you think that people own like Mcdonald's,</v>

135
00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:05.610
a lot of them will fuck their employees?
Sure.
Isn't that Kinda the same thing?

136
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.040
Yeah.
Have you got someone working for you at Mcdonald's?

137
00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:11.430
They're doing a full time shift at Mcdonald's.
They can't go anywhere.
I mean,

138
00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:13.920
there are fucking slaves.
I might as well before slaves.

139
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
<v 6>Mcdonald's is a chain and slaves are in chains.</v>

140
00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:23.390
That's fucking difference.
I mean,
no it's not.

141
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:24.670
It's certainly not as painful.

142
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:29.300
Donald's and being like having a manacle on and the door opens in some fucking

143
00:08:29.301 --> 00:08:31.210
horny guy in a wig comes in.
I

144
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.730
<v 5>think what they,
yeah,
absolutely.
But I think what they realized about slavery,</v>

145
00:08:34.731 --> 00:08:38.400
the reason why people were willing to let slavery go since it was,
you know,

146
00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:40.370
it's so,
it's such a fucking horrendous idea.

147
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:43.430
And people were willing to impose themselves so much on other people that they

148
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:46.130
literally owned that person.
Yeah.

149
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.770
But I think eventually they realize you don't have to own them.

150
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.580
Just get them addicted to things.
Right.
Get them addicted to working.

151
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.770
Get them addicted to things.
Don't you need a new car?
Look at the shiny car,

152
00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.960
new car,
but that kind of $40,000 and I only make $40,000 in a year.
Listen,

153
00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.850
we've got financing,
we've got 0% down.

154
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:05.640
You don't have to pay a single payment for three months by then.

155
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:07.160
You'll be up on your feet.
Yeah,

156
00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.590
finance that she know this fucking moron lives in an apartment.

157
00:09:10.591 --> 00:09:13.410
You can't afford the car you can't afford,
and he's a slave.

158
00:09:13.650 --> 00:09:17.280
He doesn't know he was a slave,
but he's a slave.
If you go anywhere and fuck off,

159
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:21.420
they will literally take away your ability to buy things and or throw you in

160
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:24.230
jail,
which is way worse than being a slave.

161
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:27.090
They're going to throw you in a cell with a bunch of guys want to beat you and

162
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:31.050
rape you.
Pay Your bills,
bitch.
You're a fucking slave.

163
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.670
Yeah,
it's true.
There is a version of that.
I mean,

164
00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.430
there's no doubt that the thing is playing on a loop in the background.

165
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.080
You hear it?
No.
Do you guys hear it when we're talking?
No,

166
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.900
I don't ever hear it at all anymore.
I heard dramas where I was talking.

167
00:09:48.901 --> 00:09:52.230
I was like,
what the fuck?
One of them microphone stands probably are is really,

168
00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.200
yeah.
One of the things,
oh sorry,
sorry ladies.
Gentlemen,

169
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:57.540
my ultra tuned in hearing.

170
00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.390
But here's the difference cause I've thought about this before,

171
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:03.330
which is the idea of uh,
that,
you know,

172
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:07.860
if you're working 40 hours a week,
uh,
that's its own form of slavery.

173
00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:11.100
Um,
well the whole idea of something to trick you into doing that,
it's okay.

174
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.990
It's voluntary is instead of capture you,
you know,
it's,

175
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:19.260
it's voluntary slavery instead of in both types of,
it's mental,

176
00:10:19.261 --> 00:10:21.690
it's a mental slavery.
I mean it isn't,
it isn't.

177
00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:25.350
I mean it is freewill and it is a society that's open and you can work there and

178
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:28.680
save up your money and move on to a better gig.
You know,
and it's just a Gig.

179
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:28.921
You know,

180
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:32.250
you can take it until they figure out how to make robots that can do your job.

181
00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.160
That's really what it's there for.
But you know,

182
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.370
people will argue that it's slavery.
When you see bunch of people that are super,

183
00:10:38.371 --> 00:10:41.170
super rich and then they have super poor people that work for me.

184
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:43.240
Fucking don't do.
Yeah.

185
00:10:43.241 --> 00:10:46.200
The difference that totally differences the freewill though.

186
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:49.400
You know what I mean?
That's like a huge part.
I mean,

187
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:54.300
I'm not saying that Mcdonald's or slavery,
they kind of are a little,
you know,

188
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.510
if you,
if you've got someone working all week for you and you pay him 500 bucks,

189
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:02.910
wow.
Could you imagine?
And that's like you got to get taxed to write the tax you.

190
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.680
So how much do you get?
Like three 53 50 for the week?
For the week.

191
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.480
So you got to live with a bunch of other people.

192
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.750
There's no way you can afford and you don't have time afterwards to go to
school.

193
00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.540
When you get off work,
you're fucking exhausted,
man.
What are you going to do?

194
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.560
You've been working behind a fry later hating life for eight hours.
You know,

195
00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.780
the odds are you're not gonna put up,

196
00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:24.780
put forth your best effort going to college anyway.

197
00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.210
You're going to kind of half ass it.
I,
you know,

198
00:11:27.211 --> 00:11:30.150
like whenever I've been doing more than one thing at the same time,

199
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.920
I never do as well.
Right.
You know,

200
00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:35.080
it's like why fighters can't have full time jobs and comics.

201
00:11:35.081 --> 00:11:38.370
She cannot fulltime jobs either.
If you have a full time job,
it's fucking,

202
00:11:38.371 --> 00:11:39.780
it's hard for you to write,
man.

203
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.690
It's hard to really get it and get in the sets that you need to get in.

204
00:11:42.691 --> 00:11:46.560
You need writing,
you know,
three,
four,
five a week if you can,
you know,
at least,

205
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:49.470
right.
When you're writing new material,
it's hard to do that if you have kids.

206
00:11:49.471 --> 00:11:50.790
It's hard to do that if you're married.

207
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:54.130
It's hard to do that if you work as hard as it.
That's once you're a part

208
00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:57.220
<v 1>of a system,
very difficult to change your life.
Yeah.</v>

209
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.300
It's like we have so much momentum getting honest behind us,

210
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:05.830
rather that when we get on a path,
whatever it is,
be a doctor,
you know,
be,

211
00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.290
be a fucking whatever the fuck you want to be at.
Be a mechanic.

212
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.780
Once you're on that path and you're moving and you're like,
shit,

213
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:14.380
I don't like this path.
This path sucks.
Fuck.
That's hard to change,
man.

214
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:18.100
It is so hard to switch gears and change careers.
We'll have,

215
00:12:18.101 --> 00:12:19.660
it might be one of the hardest things a person could do.

216
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:25.030
<v 6>The reason that hallucinogens became illegal is because one of the biggest pro</v>

217
00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:27.760
part proponents of hallucinogens,

218
00:12:27.761 --> 00:12:32.761
Timothy leary was taking LSD and was saying,

219
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:35.140
tune in,
turn on,
drop out.

220
00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:40.300
His advice to these people that you're talking about was completely drop out of

221
00:12:40.301 --> 00:12:41.134
society.

222
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:44.410
This game that you're playing or you think you've got to go to work and have a

223
00:12:44.411 --> 00:12:48.250
family,
it's just a game.
It doesn't exist.
It's not a real thing.

224
00:12:48.251 --> 00:12:52.810
It's time for everyone to stop playing that game and let back game die.

225
00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.790
That was the whole point.

226
00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:58.800
Dropping out of society or ejecting completely every aspect of the society

227
00:12:59.111 --> 00:13:00.520
you're in and just dropping out,

228
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:05.230
going into a commune or going into San Francisco and starting the summer of love

229
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:06.520
and wearing beads and dancing.

230
00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:10.390
<v 1>The problem is all those communes stories all end up with kids getting raped.</v>

231
00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.690
You know,
I mean,
I'm sure some of them don't,

232
00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:15.640
but I have friends that grew up on communes.

233
00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.180
I have a few of them and every one of them there was child abuse.
Okay,

234
00:13:19.390 --> 00:13:23.590
<v 6>well the the,
yeah.
Comments.
Failure.
Notorious.
Yeah.
Fail.
And they usually don't,</v>

235
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:27.430
they,
they go up in flames literally quite often.
Like shit goes weird,

236
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.900
but it's like the,

237
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:34.030
the idea that we are living the best way that we can as a society.

238
00:13:34.031 --> 00:13:37.720
Like this is the best we could do.
This is it.
This is the ultimate example.

239
00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:40.940
<v 1>I don't know.
These are the people who are afraid of love,
the idea of communes.</v>

240
00:13:40.941 --> 00:13:43.750
And you know,
I said that,
you know,
a,
a new,
uh,

241
00:13:43.751 --> 00:13:46.370
a bunch of kids that had grown up in communes from the fucked up shit had

242
00:13:46.371 --> 00:13:49.550
happened to him.
It doesn't mean that all of them do.
You know,

243
00:13:50.270 --> 00:13:53.420
if you grew up in a commune and it was awesome for you,
I'm not,
you know,

244
00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.390
I'm not negating your experience or learn or saying I know any better.

245
00:13:56.391 --> 00:14:00.170
But what is it about communes that are so scary to people when you hear about

246
00:14:00.171 --> 00:14:03.140
people branching off and going out and doing their own thing?
Like the,

247
00:14:03.141 --> 00:14:06.860
the Waco Davidian thing?
Yeah.
When you heard about that,
the cult,

248
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.550
like when you hear about a commune or cult or anything that's like really

249
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:14.780
alternative to the standard model,
things get really weird.

250
00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.170
What is that?
Why is that weird you out so much?
Well,
I mean,

251
00:14:18.171 --> 00:14:22.690
you're talking about a lifetime of living in a certain way like that,
right?

252
00:14:22.691 --> 00:14:25.040
But why do we care?
What other,
if other people want to do it,

253
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:27.080
is it because we're nervous or they're gonna attack us?

254
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:30.680
They're not going to be on our team.
What is it?
You're always scared of groups.

255
00:14:30.681 --> 00:14:34.700
You know when you see a person across the street,
you don't think anything of it,

256
00:14:34.730 --> 00:14:37.940
but you see a five of those people all in a circle.
You're like,

257
00:14:37.941 --> 00:14:40.640
what the fuck's going on over there?
It's just,
it's just human interest.

258
00:14:40.641 --> 00:14:44.570
Like something's going on there.
What are they up to?
What are they doing then?

259
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:49.070
It's mostly men.
Do you worry about groups of women?
A fuckup five women,
Bro.

260
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.010
I'll tell you what,
once hit one of those pitches,

261
00:14:52.011 --> 00:14:54.990
the rest of them are just going to start running.
Yeah,
I guess.

262
00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:00.170
But five dudes can kill you.
Yeah.
Five days can beat you to death,
you know.

263
00:15:00.250 --> 00:15:03.170
[inaudible] you gotta be real careful with dudes much more than with women.

264
00:15:03.171 --> 00:15:05.550
I mean with some woman you got to worry about him.
Yeah.
You know,

265
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.590
but obviously what is it about the big groups though that we worry,
we worry,

266
00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:10.100
you know,

267
00:15:10.100 --> 00:15:13.850
the government and I mean if you want to really kind of trip out how they handle

268
00:15:13.851 --> 00:15:17.870
that Waco thing,
watch a,
there's a documentary called rules.
Yeah.

269
00:15:17.871 --> 00:15:18.860
Rules of engagement.

270
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:22.580
And it's really interesting where it's just shows really clearly that they

271
00:15:22.581 --> 00:15:23.450
murdered all those people.

272
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.510
<v 6>Yeah.
And they drove over them.
Remember the ATF,</v>

273
00:15:26.511 --> 00:15:29.320
like drove their shit over the burnt down

274
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:30.130
<v 1>breakage.
Yeah.</v>

275
00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:33.580
They left the house is on fire and drove over the houses with tanks.
Yeah.

276
00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:37.540
It's really barbaric.
I mean,
it was just savage and it was,
you know,

277
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:41.290
this is how they had been operating for the longest time.

278
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:45.310
But the age of VCRs is fairly recent,

279
00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.890
as is the age of the Internet is today.
You know,

280
00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:51.280
we don't realize that there's a mentality of a bunch of people that were in

281
00:15:51.281 --> 00:15:56.281
charge many decades before VCRs and the ability to show video to almost anybody

282
00:15:57.551 --> 00:15:59.950
at any time.
You know,
that when VCRs came along,

283
00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.370
all of a sudden you can watch something again,
you know,
and you can,

284
00:16:03.430 --> 00:16:05.590
you could go what's going on here and what's happening there.

285
00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:09.580
Whereas before they basically picked and choosed what they broadcasted on

286
00:16:09.581 --> 00:16:13.450
television.
Once you had the ability to record things and then tape started,

287
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:18.160
you know,
passing around and,
and then,
um,
you know,
in the,
the,
uh,

288
00:16:18.161 --> 00:16:21.550
the case of Waco,
I think that was the early nineties,
right?
Wasn't it?
Yeah.

289
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.810
Was early nineties.
I think so.
Yeah.
So they had,
um,

290
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.700
they had all these fucking people living on this one compound with weapons and

291
00:16:30.701 --> 00:16:33.550
the guy was banging all the wives.
That's how it always ends,
right?

292
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:35.620
The guys is always,
the guys always banged somebody.

293
00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:37.020
<v 6>Well,
yeah,
I turned,
yeah,</v>

294
00:16:37.021 --> 00:16:40.280
it's sex gets in there that like sex worms his way in there.

295
00:16:40.281 --> 00:16:42.170
If it's not already there and shit gets weird.

296
00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:44.430
<v 1>Wow.
What a,
what a fucking weird thing.
I mean,</v>

297
00:16:44.431 --> 00:16:47.670
he made him mean he was like a martyr or he like had this self fulfilling

298
00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:49.140
prophecy.
Yeah.

299
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:51.660
He made himself out to be this Jesus character and that they would,

300
00:16:51.661 --> 00:16:55.410
all the government would come to attack him and how glorious must have been for

301
00:16:55.411 --> 00:17:00.411
him when the ATF was storming the compound in a gun fight was going on of

302
00:17:00.461 --> 00:17:04.740
bullets.
We're going,
it's like they're coming from me.
Yeah.
I'm too powerful.

303
00:17:04.741 --> 00:17:08.730
They're coming from me.
He must've been like that.
Right.
A crazy asshole.
I mean,

304
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.550
sure.
He didn't want to die,
but he must been.

305
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.370
<v 6>But yeah.
But that,
to go back to the question,</v>

306
00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:19.110
it is a very strange thing that when these alternate society spring up in our

307
00:17:19.111 --> 00:17:22.260
society,
they're usually,
um,

308
00:17:22.290 --> 00:17:26.340
they usually go bad or they end up getting attacked.
There's a standoff.

309
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.870
It's very strange thing.

310
00:17:27.871 --> 00:17:32.070
Our society does not tolerate alternative ways of living,

311
00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.000
sprouting up inside of it.
We want everyone to be living the same way.

312
00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.670
And anytime that stuff starts happening,
the,
uh,
the officials getting here,

313
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:44.850
<v 1>oh yeah.
This tune in,
drop out.
No,
it's not.
No.</v>

314
00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:48.300
<v 6>Oh yeah.
That's like,
that's scary.
That was scary.
You know what's this?</v>

315
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:53.240
I'm reading this book called the Harvard Psychedelic Clo.
Oh,
that's the Timothy.

316
00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:56.790
That's,
um,
uh,
what's his face?
The Unabomber was involved in that,
right?

317
00:17:56.850 --> 00:18:00.000
I didn't know that.
I haven't gotten to that part.
Maybe it's a different thing,

318
00:18:00.001 --> 00:18:03.900
but getting book gone.
So it's like,
um,

319
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:08.030
Timothy leary and Richard Alpert who turned into Raam.
Dot.

320
00:18:08.031 --> 00:18:12.150
So I always talk about,
and,
um,
Andrew Weil,

321
00:18:12.151 --> 00:18:13.650
the Vitamin Guy,
you know that guy,

322
00:18:13.651 --> 00:18:17.570
that guy with the giant beer and he sells vitamin products?
Yeah.
Well,

323
00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.400
like the fucking story there is that,
uh,

324
00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.810
Timothy leary goes to Mexico.
Someone gives him mushrooms.

325
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:29.460
He's never eaten mushrooms.
He takes them,
has this insane experience.

326
00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:32.910
He's a Harvard professor,
so he thinks,
oh,
we need to study this.
This is,

327
00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:37.260
this could have huge implications as far as,
uh,
psychotherapy go,
there's a,

328
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:38.190
we could use this.

329
00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:43.110
So he goes back to Harvard and starts Harvard silicide been project,

330
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:48.350
which is where they're giving siliciden to students and,
well,

331
00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:49.320
they weren't supposed to be,

332
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:53.220
but they're experimenting with silicide been to induce mystical states of being

333
00:18:53.550 --> 00:18:53.701
there,

334
00:18:53.701 --> 00:18:57.900
going into prisons with mushrooms and giving the syllable actually synthetic

335
00:18:57.901 --> 00:19:00.000
psilocybin.
They're giving that to the prisoners.

336
00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.870
The prisoners are eating it with them.
Like they would take,

337
00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:07.680
they would trip out on mushrooms,
are the prisoners to try to do therapy.

338
00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:09.990
And so,
um,

339
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:15.090
Andrew Weil fucking goes into one of their meetings where the staff is meeting

340
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:20.091
about this and like right to kind of negative news story and Harvard about how

341
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:25.190
these professors have started a semi called and her giving psychedelics to their

342
00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:25.981
students.

343
00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:30.981
And this ended up in Timothy leary and Richard Alpert getting kicked out of

344
00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:34.110
Harvard because like the Harvard newspaper,
and I,

345
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:37.380
I don't remember the name of it was,
is read by like the president and stuff.

346
00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:42.210
And so they got kicked out of Harvard and they went down to Mexico or taking

347
00:19:42.211 --> 00:19:44.210
mushrooms.
And,
um,

348
00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.250
this woman who used to,

349
00:19:47.490 --> 00:19:51.750
whose husband used to be in the CIA was hanging out with them and she told

350
00:19:51.751 --> 00:19:52.530
Timothy leary,

351
00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:57.360
everybody's totally cool with you guys doing this as long as you keep it quiet,

352
00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:00.870
like don't be loud about this.
And then according to Timothy Leary,

353
00:20:00.871 --> 00:20:05.871
she called him like a few days before Kennedy died and told him he's,

354
00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:07.980
he's like,
he,
he's,
uh,

355
00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:11.130
he's going to start talking about everything and I'm really worried about the

356
00:20:11.131 --> 00:20:14.580
precedent.
And then like a few days later,
he got shot.

357
00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:16.800
That's according to Timothy leary.
But,

358
00:20:16.801 --> 00:20:19.440
so you're saying that President Kennedy was doing acid?
Well,

359
00:20:19.441 --> 00:20:23.890
President Kennedy came from Harvard and yes,
according to this book,
uh,

360
00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:29.130
uh,
this woman who dated Timothy leary supposedly went to this,

361
00:20:29.370 --> 00:20:34.320
uh,
Mexican p to this retreat or the hotel in Mexico.
And,
and as I recall,

362
00:20:34.321 --> 00:20:37.020
like,
um,
you know,

363
00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:41.100
said that she wanted to get some LSD for someone who's too famous to talk about.

364
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.760
And,
uh,
uh,
that,
so that,

365
00:20:43.761 --> 00:20:47.320
that's an underground legend is that sounds like a bitch already said too much

366
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:50.070
<v 1>about a kidnap her and thrown in the basement.</v>

367
00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.910
So she told me who the fuck that was.
That's a useless bitch right there.

368
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.070
And that seems ridiculous.
The whole talk way too much.
Yeah.

369
00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.930
That story sounds like something that someone makes up when they work at like a

370
00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.280
resort,
you know,
it's not ridiculous.
Counters got a great story.

371
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:05.860
That's like some guy that does a lot of drugs and talks at dolphins are at that,

372
00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.010
but the CIA was experimenting with Lsd.
Yeah.

373
00:21:09.011 --> 00:21:11.890
Well that was what I was going to bring up when you said that.

374
00:21:11.891 --> 00:21:13.920
I thought you were talking about Ted Kaczynski.
You know,

375
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:19.100
the CIA did a bunch of studies in 1962 out of Harvard and Ted Kaczynski

376
00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:24.160
volunteered for these studies and they cooked his fucking brain.
Man.

377
00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:28.180
They created the uni bomber.
It's very,
very likely they created him.

378
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.530
When he got out of there,

379
00:21:29.531 --> 00:21:33.130
he was absolutely convinced that there was some sort of a war going on between

380
00:21:33.131 --> 00:21:38.131
technology and US and that he had to stop all these people from making

381
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:39.064
technology.

382
00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:43.420
So what he did was he got a cabin in the woods and Montane worked for like five

383
00:21:43.421 --> 00:21:47.230
years as a professor just to save up the money,
maybe three years as a professor,

384
00:21:47.231 --> 00:21:50.170
just to stay,
save up enough money to fund his trip.

385
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.890
And then he moved and just started this attack on all of these professors and

386
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:57.040
innovators and all these people that were involved in,
in technology.

387
00:21:57.041 --> 00:22:01.450
But they come bombs,
they cooked him,
do crazy.
They cooked him at Harvard,
man.

388
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.830
And that's something that is very,
that's not very really well known man,

389
00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.390
because people have heard of that story.

390
00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:13.810
People have no idea about the history of Lsd at all.
It's,

391
00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:18.730
well,
if you want to look online,
look up.
I'll,
um,
the CIA doses,

392
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:19.840
French town,

393
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:24.960
because there was a town in France where it's been by the freedom of Information

394
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:25.001
Act.

395
00:22:25.001 --> 00:22:29.020
These papers had been released and they found out that they did LSD studies on

396
00:22:29.021 --> 00:22:31.420
whole towns in France.

397
00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.030
They would dose the whole fucking village and watch people commit suicide watch.

398
00:22:37.031 --> 00:22:41.500
All kinds of crazy shit happened.
Excuse me.
Um,

399
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:46.430
so you know,
they'd been doing shit on soldiers had states and Britain.
There's,

400
00:22:46.431 --> 00:22:51.270
there's videos of a British troops all dosed up on LSD.
Wandering around.

401
00:22:51.271 --> 00:22:53.230
Yeah,
it's fucking weird.
Amazing.

402
00:22:53.231 --> 00:22:55.950
And now it's 10 years they were doing at Harvard,
uh,

403
00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.520
10 years before leary started doing the experiments themselves to do,
you know,

404
00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:04.000
when I saw that,
it was hilarious.
Speaking of old Shit,

405
00:23:04.330 --> 00:23:08.890
I watch flash Gordon on the plane,
on the plane home from Toronto,

406
00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:11.770
the original dude,
they have these little,
you know,

407
00:23:11.771 --> 00:23:16.330
you can pick a TV show or movie Flash Gordon episode one,
two.

408
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:20.590
And I don't know if there's more,
it is amazing how bad it is.

409
00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.110
I don't know what year that was.
Do you know,
in the years that was,

410
00:23:23.111 --> 00:23:26.980
now let me look it up real quick because it was incredible.
The,
the,

411
00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.200
the special effects were awesome.

412
00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:34.330
They were so bad that it looks like a show that's trying to fuck around.

413
00:23:34.331 --> 00:23:37.600
It looks like a show that like maybe Tim and Eric would do or the guys from

414
00:23:37.601 --> 00:23:39.280
south park if they really like,
yeah.

415
00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:44.110
Did you see yourself in 1936 that's when it is.

416
00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.500
Do you know how crazy is?

417
00:23:45.501 --> 00:23:50.501
We're talking about 1936 and this is like pre world war two man.

418
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:56.290
So they've got this fucking ridiculous spaceship that is got sparklers like,

419
00:23:57.381 --> 00:24:02.000
like 4th of July sparklers behind it and it's on a string and it's like swinging

420
00:24:02.001 --> 00:24:05.960
on a string with the sparkler shooting behind it and the way it's operated,

421
00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:10.100
the enzyme with what they thought a spaceship would be like is,
it's insane.

422
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:11.750
There's a guy in a seat,

423
00:24:12.050 --> 00:24:15.620
he's just sitting in a seat and he's got like a periscope just like you would

424
00:24:15.621 --> 00:24:19.040
have in a submarine because they had submarines,
Baghdad.
Dude,

425
00:24:19.090 --> 00:24:20.780
there's no monitors.
There's no not there.

426
00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:23.360
Did going through space and they don't even have monitors.

427
00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:24.870
They never envisioned monitors.

428
00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:28.260
So back then you were like buying every single second.
I'm like,
yeah,

429
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.390
that was so realists.
Dude.
It is awesome,
and I just looked up on IMD MDB.

430
00:24:32.391 --> 00:24:35.150
Apparently there's a DVD set you can get.

431
00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.630
I fully recommend a stone session.

432
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:43.100
Get stoned as fuck and watch flash Gordon.
It's going to be awesome,
but that's,

433
00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:47.150
it's amazing.
It's amazing to think that that's even real,

434
00:24:47.430 --> 00:24:51.770
that this was like this was a show or the movie rather,
where you know they were,

435
00:24:51.771 --> 00:24:54.950
they were,
this was fucking legit.
People get fired up.

436
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.330
We're going to go see Flash Gordon.

437
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:58.360
He's going to beat that and beating the Lawrenceville Sga.
You

438
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:04.070
go in there and that's hilarious.
By their homemade coca cola.

439
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:08.060
I was watching old twilight zone.
Same thing.
Not as bad as that,

440
00:25:08.061 --> 00:25:10.550
but twilight zone,
like the old school series,

441
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:14.780
they're mostly had to do with astronauts and you have photos like it was the

442
00:25:14.781 --> 00:25:16.880
same always about space stuff.

443
00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:20.750
It's so weird that people bought that back in the day.
I love the twilight.

444
00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:23.780
I love watching old twilight towns.
Yeah,
there's,

445
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:25.940
you know what my favorite one is Burgess Meredith.

446
00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:29.660
When is the last man on earth and as he is,
he's like in a bookstore.

447
00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:32.450
So he gets all these books and he's still excited cause that's all he wanted to

448
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:35.210
do.
People just bother him.
He really just wanted to read books.
Yeah.

449
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:38.900
And so a nuclear bomb hits everybody's dead and he's got all the books in the

450
00:25:38.901 --> 00:25:41.840
world to read,
but he breaks his glasses.
Uh,

451
00:25:41.841 --> 00:25:45.830
I remember that one did so good.
That was awesome.

452
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.150
That was awesome.
That was really the perfect show was the perfect show.

453
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:54.440
When is when that episode was Donald's like wow,
perfect show.

454
00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.870
They did a twilight zone where a pool,

455
00:25:57.140 --> 00:25:59.660
a pool hustler wanting to play the the dead guy.

456
00:26:00.170 --> 00:26:05.090
And when he wins he goes to hell and he wins and he's guarding over the pool

457
00:26:05.091 --> 00:26:08.000
table waiting for the next guy because he wasted his whole life playing pool.

458
00:26:08.030 --> 00:26:12.170
That's his,
that's his suffering.
Those twilight tones are all so good.

459
00:26:12.171 --> 00:26:14.720
How come there isn't a show like that now?
I try to do man,

460
00:26:14.721 --> 00:26:17.750
every subjects we covered a billion times over to be completely and totally

461
00:26:17.751 --> 00:26:20.690
original like that.
Like wow.
You're talking about,
you know,

462
00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:22.310
millions and millions of shows.

463
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:27.350
It's fucking how much stuff has been made since 1936 and they buck Rogers or

464
00:26:27.351 --> 00:26:29.510
Flash Gordon,
you remember amazing stories.

465
00:26:29.511 --> 00:26:32.480
They tried to Redo kind of like that same format.
That was awesome.

466
00:26:32.481 --> 00:26:34.430
I never saw that.
Amazing stories.
That's pretty good time.

467
00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:37.220
It's like in the eighties I love those toilets on movies too.

468
00:26:37.221 --> 00:26:40.070
But then the course that one with John Landis had that horrible accident with a

469
00:26:40.071 --> 00:26:44.030
helicopter crash.
His crazy wife to kind of head off.
Yeah,
you're

470
00:26:44.050 --> 00:26:46.590
<v 0>capitated dude,
that it's fucked up.</v>

471
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:50.050
<v 1>Fuck movies with explosions and helicopters.</v>

472
00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:51.700
Keep that shit away from me.

473
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.180
The good news is they don't really have to do that anymore because now they have

474
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.260
CGI.
They just,
you know,
fake the whole thing.
They don't,
you know,

475
00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:02.590
in 2012 nobody really jumped a car over a fucking canyon,
you know what I mean?

476
00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.200
They just had,
the whole thing was fake.
So it's nice.

477
00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.410
You don't really have to risk your life for some shitty moving men are fucking

478
00:27:08.411 --> 00:27:10.510
crazy man,
dude.
Like the craziest,

479
00:27:10.511 --> 00:27:13.540
I worked with those guys for years on fear factor on fear factor.

480
00:27:13.541 --> 00:27:16.700
I work was stunt guys.
I knew a few guys from Jujitsu.
Um,

481
00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:21.150
my friend will we train to John jogs a new couple other guys when there um,

482
00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:25.840
but uh,
there are fucking animals.
All of them have like,
oh this is metal.

483
00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:28.150
I got a fucking fake collar bone and you know,

484
00:27:28.151 --> 00:27:31.240
I got 18 stitches in our 18 plates in this hand.

485
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:32.710
<v 0>Have you seen the video of the,</v>

486
00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:37.510
of the window washer and lethal weapon that is washing the window and the car

487
00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.040
basically it's a stunt that went wrong and a car went through the wrong windows.

488
00:27:42.041 --> 00:27:44.980
So there's the two stunt guys and they're like washing this window because they

489
00:27:44.981 --> 00:27:49.390
have the outtakes and you see them like all of a sudden brace themselves and one

490
00:27:49.391 --> 00:27:53.980
guy like jumps trying to get out of the way and a card is,
goes through a window,

491
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:59.270
smacks one of them knocks and backwards into the a building he was finally,

492
00:27:59.290 --> 00:28:01.480
he wasn't fine.
He had to go to the hospital for a couple of weeks.

493
00:28:01.481 --> 00:28:04.450
I just met that guy.
Fucking crazy.
Is it in the video?

494
00:28:04.451 --> 00:28:06.430
Can you see it in the video?
It's on the Internet.

495
00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:11.240
Look up lethal weapon like stuntmen man accident,
but match it.

496
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.050
He was such a cool guy.
It's like stuntmen or,

497
00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.540
or like a very specific type of person and it's like a job that sometimes passed

498
00:28:18.541 --> 00:28:22.690
down through families and stuff.
It's like a,
you have to be really,

499
00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:27.770
really crazy to do that.
You gotta be tough as fuck tough entails.

500
00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:31.360
Tait Fletcher has been doing,
he's been doing like all the avenger movies.
Oh,

501
00:28:31.361 --> 00:28:34.420
totally makes sense.
But they're super,
they're super careful.

502
00:28:34.421 --> 00:28:37.360
They're super careful and they're like,
I'm there.

503
00:28:37.630 --> 00:28:40.810
It's really interesting to see how it fits,
how fastidious they are.

504
00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.510
But this guy was talking to him about the stunt and uh,

505
00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:47.560
he just kept saying fire stunts are as safe as they could be.

506
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:51.460
There's nothing safer than a Firestone.
I'd set,
my kid's on fire.
He can say,

507
00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:56.020
what the fuck?
Jesus Christ.
Yeah.
That's a guy.

508
00:28:56.021 --> 00:28:58.560
Might be a little too confident with himself.
I know.
I mean you,

509
00:28:58.561 --> 00:29:00.310
I guess you have to be.
Cause if you're scared,

510
00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:05.560
if you're scared during one of these stunts and you spend any energy on fear,

511
00:29:05.561 --> 00:29:10.180
you're fucked.
You'll,
you'll get killed.
I couldn't hurt it.
That shit.
Fuck that.

512
00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:15.310
Even the girl stunt,
I can med being a girl doing that.
The stunt women,

513
00:29:15.311 --> 00:29:19.150
because it was a tough broads.
They're getting thrown out of the back of trucks.

514
00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:22.290
The fall guy.
Come on.
Remember the fall guy,

515
00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.950
Mr you remember Alf Alf's,
Joey Diaz gigs.

516
00:29:26.951 --> 00:29:31.730
A stunt man now Joe,
you remember out with was alpha.

517
00:29:31.740 --> 00:29:36.730
I was an alien.
We cats.
Really?
Yeah.
How did that get through?

518
00:29:37.210 --> 00:29:41.350
<v 1>Watched an episode of Alpha.
I kind of pride really from that or sure.</v>

519
00:29:41.410 --> 00:29:42.280
All current.

520
00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:44.980
<v 5>Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

521
00:29:44.981 --> 00:29:49.510
I remember it was a reference that hack comedians would do in the eighties or

522
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:53.680
the nineties rather max headroom.
How bad ass it before the time was that guy,

523
00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.670
what was that all about?
He was like as a Hologram.
Hologram.

524
00:29:56.760 --> 00:29:57.940
Who was he supposed to be?

525
00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.230
She's supposed to be a computer or something and this is huge.

526
00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.460
This big computer programmer.
He lived in the computer.
Yeah.
I don't remember.

527
00:30:03.461 --> 00:30:05.560
Was He?
Oh,
see artificial intelligence.

528
00:30:05.561 --> 00:30:08.620
That's what it was like how I used to watch that show.
The TV show.

529
00:30:08.621 --> 00:30:11.890
I remember I was at fucking loved it back in the day.
It started off as at what?

530
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:15.010
A Pepsi commercial or something or,
and then it became a show.

531
00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.240
Then became a TV show.

532
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:20.620
I saw that guy in some weird B movie one day or the guy that played that guy.

533
00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:25.570
Huh?
It was weird.
I was like,
no,
no,
no.
Your Max head room for,

534
00:30:25.571 --> 00:30:28.720
I can't be some guy in some movie who's like a cop,
you know?

535
00:30:28.721 --> 00:30:32.040
I think we've got a clue here.
I was like a bad cop movie.
It's a,

536
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:35.200
they really haven't brought him back for like to sell iPads or something.

537
00:30:35.290 --> 00:30:39.310
You know?
Why don't you fucking make the pitch son do it.
Get that guy together.

538
00:30:39.311 --> 00:30:41.410
You know,
today with the technology that we have today,

539
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.940
you actually could do that if you wanted to.

540
00:30:42.970 --> 00:30:45.760
You could just film it on a green screen,
green screen of your own,

541
00:30:45.761 --> 00:30:50.050
throw it through your laptop.
Super easy,
using super easy.
So,

542
00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:54.230
so come going back to this flash Gordon thing,
man,
if you ever want to fucking,

543
00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.330
you ever need proof of evolution for knuckleheads?
Just look at Flash Gordon.

544
00:30:58.510 --> 00:31:03.370
Look at that from 1936 and look at us today in 2011 if you can't see that things

545
00:31:03.371 --> 00:31:07.990
are changing and moving in a certain direction,
the complexity of the dialogue,

546
00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:12.370
the simplicity of it in the Flash Gordon movie as compared to like what you were

547
00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:15.910
having in this conversation right here.
We're two totally different human beings.

548
00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.350
I mean these people were,

549
00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:20.890
I don't know if they were incredibly naive or if just the,

550
00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.300
if it was that the cinema was so new and naive that it could be stupid and fake

551
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.300
because Noah,
everyone sort of accepted it.
You know what I mean?

552
00:31:28.301 --> 00:31:31.630
Like when they saw those old King Kong movies,
like I love the first guy.

553
00:31:31.631 --> 00:31:34.270
I love all the King Kong movies,
but the first one was pretty bad ass,

554
00:31:34.271 --> 00:31:39.070
but it's so fake looking.
It's so bad if you go and watch it now,

555
00:31:39.071 --> 00:31:43.660
you're like,
Whoa,
what?
But back then they knew,
you know,

556
00:31:43.661 --> 00:31:46.450
the knew it was gonna.
It was good for them.
I was like,
wow,

557
00:31:46.451 --> 00:31:48.430
I can't believe that that's the monster.
You know?

558
00:31:48.431 --> 00:31:51.610
They didn't have anything to compare it to.
They knew it didn't look real,

559
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.580
but they were still impressed that pertain Kong's a hell of a monster.

560
00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:58.920
What a great movie.
Right.
You know what I mean?
Yeah,
totally.
It's like,
you know,

561
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:02.830
it's like three d look how much three ds evolve.
But when you first went to,

562
00:32:02.831 --> 00:32:06.730
when I went to see jaws three d when it came out and where those red and blue

563
00:32:06.731 --> 00:32:11.350
glasses,
I was like,
oh my God,
Holy Shit,
this is incredible.
Like they,

564
00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:14.650
there was one scene where a needle came out of the screen and it was just like,

565
00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:18.370
whoa,
that's crazy.
But,
so I was just happy.
I didn't care about,

566
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.130
I didn't know that there could be better three,
three d than that.

567
00:32:21.131 --> 00:32:23.290
I was just blown away.
So it must've been the same thing.

568
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:26.270
It's kind of weird how it took a long time for three d made a comeback.

569
00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.590
I don't really think I really made a come back either.

570
00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:30.490
Well Dude Avatar in my opinion,

571
00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:35.520
the Admin of combat and when I saw it in imax three d that's like an experienced

572
00:32:35.921 --> 00:32:38.640
man.
Yeah.
I had a smile on my face,
that whole movie.

573
00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.130
And when I heard all these people

574
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.490
<v 0>that were like,
Oh that movie's so the plot was very transparent and like,</v>

575
00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:47.210
oh my God,
shut up.
Shut up.
Stupid.
How could you not enjoy that?

576
00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:52.130
Oh you're telling me the big blue aliens aren't real.
Whoa,
get outta here.

577
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:52.820
No.

578
00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:57.680
Are People like after Avatar people reporting depression like,

579
00:32:57.681 --> 00:33:02.420
but yeah,
cause they are,
depression was a real thing.
Yeah.
It's a fucking,

580
00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.170
there was no color and after Avatar,
I wonder how it's recognized.

581
00:33:06.171 --> 00:33:08.580
I wonder if like psychologists are behind it.
You,

582
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:10.250
well you have avatar depression.

583
00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:15.200
It sounds like you've got a bad case of Avatar to press that's not outside the

584
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:18.080
realm of possibility.
Oh sure.
Yeah.

585
00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.350
Well I know the depression that comes from um,

586
00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:24.740
playing a really awesome video game.
And then going out into the world,

587
00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:28.450
you know what I mean?
Like there is,
we're driving here and we'd go,

588
00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.810
we go by this mountain of rocks and he looks out the window and he goes,
oh,

589
00:33:32.811 --> 00:33:36.820
that's like what?
What is that Chris Mar?
Oh,
good word for word work,
right?

590
00:33:38.380 --> 00:33:42.500
I'm like,
I don't even know what that means.
You have a fantasy environment.

591
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.150
What the fuck are you talking about?
Well,
I just got this Imac.

592
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:51.620
I just got this like giant Imac,
like the biggest monitor I've ever had.

593
00:33:51.770 --> 00:33:55.310
So I was like,
well,
aren't those awesome?
I've got to see what words suck.

594
00:33:55.311 --> 00:33:59.510
Mine died today.
Yeah,
but it's probably just a hard drive and no hope not.
Oh God.

595
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:03.660
I've got to back your shit up,
dude.
You got knocked up there.

596
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:06.080
Don't have things back.
Not that,
not that computer,

597
00:34:06.081 --> 00:34:07.670
because I use that computer just for audio,

598
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:12.110
like you know for podcast and audio and you can slap a fucking one terabyte

599
00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:15.260
drive on it.
14 Times.
Share Bite,
full drives.

600
00:34:15.261 --> 00:34:18.440
I just keep on running out of hard drive space.
Wow,
that's incredible.
Yeah.

601
00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:21.080
Fucking sucks.
That shit needs to go away.
What happened to,

602
00:34:21.230 --> 00:34:22.790
I remember when I worked at gateway computers,

603
00:34:22.791 --> 00:34:24.760
I don't know if we talked about it as anyway he's telling him,

604
00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:26.420
put him on his back.
It is awesome.

605
00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:29.180
I know you were saying that your shit died but it is awesome.

606
00:34:29.181 --> 00:34:30.140
And what were you gonna say about that?

607
00:34:30.141 --> 00:34:35.141
I was going to say it's like a fucking window and do an alternate universe.

608
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:38.630
When you've got a really good video game and you're looking at it,

609
00:34:38.990 --> 00:34:41.240
it's like these,
I think the word video games,

610
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:44.270
you got to go down the tube is man because you,
you,
someone hears,
you say,

611
00:34:44.271 --> 00:34:46.760
I love to play video games.
They're like you fucking nerd.

612
00:34:46.970 --> 00:34:48.920
But it's like it cause you know it's like,

613
00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:51.620
but what it's turning into it's not really,

614
00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:55.340
it's going to get to the point where it's not video games anymore where it's

615
00:34:55.341 --> 00:34:58.760
something else.
Like I feel like it's like world of Warcraft,

616
00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.730
starcraft,
all these like a portal.
What we're,

617
00:35:02.750 --> 00:35:07.750
this is the very first surge of water and this virtual tsunami that's about to

618
00:35:08.331 --> 00:35:11.420
come subjectively sweeping over everyone.

619
00:35:11.421 --> 00:35:15.800
Because that thing you say about like maybe our neurology can't resist movies

620
00:35:15.801 --> 00:35:18.080
cause it's so overpowering.
Yeah.
It's like,

621
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.440
I think that there's going to be some truth to that because these games are

622
00:35:21.441 --> 00:35:24.800
missing a few components.
And this is,
this is what I think of when I'm stoned,

623
00:35:24.801 --> 00:35:28.100
playing world of Warcraft.
If I could smell like,

624
00:35:28.101 --> 00:35:32.180
if there was a sense of smell involved in this and also they've made that,

625
00:35:32.181 --> 00:35:35.930
there was a sense of like,
yeah,
I mean it's,
they've made machines that do that.

626
00:35:36.310 --> 00:35:38.460
I don't think I ever have to be a mind

627
00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.430
<v 5>thing.
It's a mind machine thing.
I think it's going to have to be,</v>

628
00:35:41.431 --> 00:35:45.390
so it's gonna be a little,
stimulate some part of your mind.
It's the mouse.
Yeah.

629
00:35:45.391 --> 00:35:48.330
Like maybe you can wear some,
maybe everyone's going to have to shave their head.

630
00:35:48.450 --> 00:35:50.490
Like real players.
If you,
you know,

631
00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:54.090
you're going to have to do like a horizontal Mohawk thing.
Real plates.
I,

632
00:35:54.091 --> 00:35:56.820
you know,
like this dude's legit,
he doesn't give a fuck,
goes out to the club,

633
00:35:56.821 --> 00:36:00.600
but this big stripe shaved down his head and then you put this thing on skin to

634
00:36:00.601 --> 00:36:05.280
skin on your head and it has precise,
like you line it up on the video game,

635
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.490
he'll show you how to line it up with the exact cortex,

636
00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:09.840
exact portion of your brain.

637
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:14.920
And then it sends signals that show you like burning,
meet,
smell and show.
Yeah.

638
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:17.810
And then,
but then you know what else it does while you're,

639
00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:19.830
and this is really weird,
while you're playing the game,

640
00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:23.580
it erases your memory of your previous life.

641
00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:25.560
So the moment that thing goes on,

642
00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.450
you have no more past you or just the memories of the character in the game,

643
00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:33.180
rushing through the game,
playing the game,

644
00:36:33.181 --> 00:36:37.350
completely unaware of the fact that you used to exist as a person too.

645
00:36:37.410 --> 00:36:41.250
And then you know what happens?
You're doing a podcast,
you're like,

646
00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:43.650
oh fuck man,
my heart feels weird.

647
00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:48.720
And you suddenly wake up and your futuristic apart and you're like,
aw man,

648
00:36:48.721 --> 00:36:53.130
that game was awesome.
So right now we're playing a game.
Yeah.
Yeah.

649
00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:53.821
Like yeah,

650
00:36:53.821 --> 00:36:57.240
like that with a lot of people say this could be like some alien simulation,

651
00:36:57.241 --> 00:37:01.050
you know that we're just an alien and involved in a really high powered,

652
00:37:01.051 --> 00:37:05.670
super advanced bad as video game called planet experience.

653
00:37:05.671 --> 00:37:08.550
The lives of billions of people all individually.

654
00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.670
I wrote something once about maybe the life that we're living.

655
00:37:11.671 --> 00:37:15.780
Maybe the reason why it seems so fake is cause it is fake and what we are in and

656
00:37:15.781 --> 00:37:20.220
some sort of a reality simulation of the roaring twenties of the technological

657
00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:20.780
age.

658
00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:25.780
Like maybe we live in some time where everything is all scented candles and

659
00:37:25.861 --> 00:37:30.060
perfectly lit white rooms and no one has a muscle car and no one's getting their

660
00:37:30.061 --> 00:37:31.680
dick sucked.
And you know,

661
00:37:31.681 --> 00:37:35.760
and maybe there's like a simulator that you can run where you run where it's

662
00:37:35.761 --> 00:37:39.570
just chaos but chaos that's entertaining as fuck.

663
00:37:39.850 --> 00:37:42.510
It's like every time you turn around there's some new thing.

664
00:37:42.511 --> 00:37:45.330
Christina Aguilar fucking up the national anthem,

665
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.390
2 billion people tuning into the wedding.

666
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:53.510
There's constant shit going on to keep you entertained and you are,

667
00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:58.410
you are in this biological ride canister.
Yeah.

668
00:37:58.411 --> 00:38:01.530
And you're going through this thing,
you know,
you're in this year,

669
00:38:01.630 --> 00:38:05.910
your portal to this ride is your skin and your flesh pops,

670
00:38:05.911 --> 00:38:08.610
it pops through into this dimension and you know,

671
00:38:08.611 --> 00:38:12.540
and it sounds like you're advocating fantasy.
It sounds like you're advocating,

672
00:38:12.750 --> 00:38:13.501
well,
you know,

673
00:38:13.501 --> 00:38:17.280
so you want to look at your life as if says if it's some sort of a simulation

674
00:38:17.281 --> 00:38:20.280
and just live it as a simulation.
Well,
no,
I'm just saying,
yeah.
I'm saying yes,

675
00:38:20.281 --> 00:38:22.980
I am sad.
Why not?
Right.
It's very empowering.
Yeah.

676
00:38:22.981 --> 00:38:25.290
I think the first person ever heard suggests that was Mckenna.

677
00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.850
I think Mckenna was talking about,
uh,
you,
how did he say he was?

678
00:38:29.851 --> 00:38:32.550
And he was quoting someone else.
So I'm doing a third hand quote,

679
00:38:32.850 --> 00:38:35.470
but he said you should view your life as

680
00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:37.673
<v 7>you say it,</v>

681
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:44.160
as a conspiracy or as a view your life as it's as it's as if the world is run by

682
00:38:45.101 --> 00:38:49.990
a select group of people and that group of people is you and your friends.

683
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.850
Yeah.
The,
your,
your,

684
00:38:51.851 --> 00:38:56.260
you're somehow or another secretly in charge with running the world and running

685
00:38:56.261 --> 00:38:56.910
the university,

686
00:38:56.910 --> 00:38:59.050
the most important things in the university shoe and your friends.

687
00:38:59.170 --> 00:39:01.330
Cause it's the most empowering way to view the world.

688
00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:04.450
<v 6>Well,
yeah,
because what's that?
Yeah.
Cause what's the other side?</v>

689
00:39:04.451 --> 00:39:08.410
The other side of it is this kind of like pseudo empathy for like strangers that

690
00:39:08.411 --> 00:39:08.921
you don't know.

691
00:39:08.921 --> 00:39:13.360
Like so many people wander through their day just frothing with terror or

692
00:39:13.361 --> 00:39:16.690
whatever they've seen on the news.
And so for them the world's awful,

693
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:22.270
but then they're real situation is usually pretty good.
Yeah.
You know,

694
00:39:22.271 --> 00:39:24.680
like it's like a fucking,
uh,

695
00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:27.760
Bill Hicks has that awesome joke about CNN,
CNN,

696
00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:31.030
watch the news and then outside it's like beautiful and the grass is growing,

697
00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:31.360
right?

698
00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:36.130
So there's this mental pollution that comes pouring out of every information

699
00:39:36.131 --> 00:39:40.990
device that we have and that like corrupts your mind and you begin to think

700
00:39:40.991 --> 00:39:45.190
you're in a horror story when your real reality is one that's usually quite

701
00:39:45.191 --> 00:39:46.024
pleasant.

702
00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:50.400
<v 7>This theme has been going back and forth with me over the last couple of weeks I</v>

703
00:39:50.401 --> 00:39:53.670
was talking about.
And even on stage in Canada that I don't think,

704
00:39:53.671 --> 00:39:57.120
and I think it goes along with the same thing that we were talking about as far

705
00:39:57.121 --> 00:40:00.710
as us not being able to process films and w w you know,

706
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.160
movies and that what I was saying with that was that movies for,

707
00:40:04.161 --> 00:40:05.790
for those people who've never heard it before,

708
00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.780
I think that human beings are set up to imitate their atmosphere and we're set

709
00:40:09.781 --> 00:40:13.380
up to find the Alpha and follow him because he's the old leader and you know,

710
00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.410
he's the guy with the broad sword that is the most nicks in it and,

711
00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:19.280
and he's experienced things and you can learn from him.
And so we,

712
00:40:19.290 --> 00:40:21.900
so we follow him that we don't,

713
00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.780
we were set up to imitate our atmosphere,

714
00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:29.100
but we don't know when our atmosphere is bullshit.
Those same signals.

715
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.900
All of a sudden we're getting them from a hundred foot screen and right.

716
00:40:32.930 --> 00:40:36.810
And we're sitting there and Imac surround sound and the hero,

717
00:40:36.811 --> 00:40:39.240
every time he comes on screen,
he says the exact right thing.

718
00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:42.330
But he's got a fucking team of writers and they've been working on it for weeks

719
00:40:42.331 --> 00:40:47.040
and there's music plays every time he's in the room and you get drawn into this

720
00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:49.800
thing where it's,
it's incredibly influential,

721
00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:54.930
like almost more so than real life.
Yeah,
and I don't think we're set up to,

722
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:59.370
to process that.
I think we're set up to process the natural world.
Well,

723
00:40:59.371 --> 00:41:01.530
I mean that this is along the same lines.
Is that right?

724
00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:05.170
I think when you look at the news and there's terrible things going on all of

725
00:41:05.171 --> 00:41:08.310
the world,
I don't think we're set up to process the world.

726
00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.090
We're set up to process or fucking neighborhood,
right?
The universe.

727
00:41:12.091 --> 00:41:13.830
The world is a chaotic fucking place.

728
00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:16.680
And the key is when some are socks gotta get the fuck out of there.

729
00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:18.600
That's how people got to America in the first place.

730
00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:21.810
That's why people crossed the Bering strait when they came over from Asia.

731
00:41:21.930 --> 00:41:24.660
Every PR people,
we are nomadic for a reason.

732
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:28.380
It's because the world is spinning around a fucking nuclear explosion and

733
00:41:28.381 --> 00:41:30.900
sometimes it gets a little too far away.
And when it does,

734
00:41:30.901 --> 00:41:34.040
everything freezes to death.
Okay.
So you've got to move around.
You got

735
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:37.130
<v 5>to keep moving.
And I think we are,</v>

736
00:41:37.170 --> 00:41:41.030
we supposed to be in a good spot and surround ourselves with a bunch of good

737
00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:45.530
people,
but we can't be looking at the whole goddamn thing all at once.

738
00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:50.420
The whole six to 7 billion people all over the world.
Yeah.
Everywhere you go,

739
00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:54.950
you're going to see bombs going off and people getting shot and planes drop and

740
00:41:54.951 --> 00:41:58.320
fucking missiles out of the sky into the wrong building.
And you know,

741
00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:02.720
you're gonna see that everywhere because they're so fucking many of us.

742
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.670
You're not supposed to be monitoring the whole,

743
00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:08.550
<v 6>well,
I mean it's,
it messes up the paradigm people are enjoying.</v>

744
00:42:08.551 --> 00:42:13.220
And that paradigm is its own little virtual reality game.
It's like they,

745
00:42:13.221 --> 00:42:15.270
you know,
people live in denial of death.

746
00:42:15.271 --> 00:42:17.460
They live in denial of the impermanence of everything.

747
00:42:17.461 --> 00:42:20.130
They live in denial of their,

748
00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.820
of the fact that you will not be able to hold on to anything.

749
00:42:23.821 --> 00:42:26.940
Ownership as a complete illusion.
You can't really own anything.

750
00:42:26.941 --> 00:42:28.930
There's no such thing as it's countries,

751
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:32.250
but you can hold onto it for a little bit our countries because if you go over

752
00:42:32.251 --> 00:42:35.000
there,
you've got to have a passport.
Yeah.
But those countries can lock you out.

753
00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.390
Those aren't,
those countries are in.

754
00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:41.490
These are what's happening is people are in forcing invisible thing.

755
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:43.890
Right.
But they are enforcing them.
Well,
yeah,

756
00:42:43.891 --> 00:42:47.670
but that there's hearing me for example,
there's law take the law of gravity.

757
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:51.720
The law of gravity does not need police officers to make sure that the law of

758
00:42:51.721 --> 00:42:55.640
gravity works.
If you jump off a cliff,
it's not like you land at the bottom here.

759
00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.650
Okay.
And cops come and arrest you and say,
you just broke the law of gravity.

760
00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.530
We're going to have to kill you.
The law of gravity kills you.

761
00:43:01.830 --> 00:43:03.420
The human laws on the other hand,

762
00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:08.610
these are laws that they aren't real except from the enforcement of human beings

763
00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:11.810
and from things written down on paper.
But there they are.

764
00:43:11.850 --> 00:43:16.850
It's not real in the sense of the law of gravity and is a society shifted

765
00:43:16.921 --> 00:43:19.380
throughout time.
These laws have changed too.

766
00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:22.400
So they're impermanent and they're always,
I mean,
God,
there used to be,
uh,

767
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.340
bathrooms for black people.
You know what I mean?
That was a real law.

768
00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:29.340
That was a real thing.
And that,
that law is not real.

769
00:43:29.370 --> 00:43:31.140
That law doesn't exist on the planet.

770
00:43:31.380 --> 00:43:34.960
There's no underlying mechanism.
Uh,

771
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.600
<v 5>we've seen it.
But it seems to me,
this is like a argument of semantics.</v>

772
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:42.170
It's like what is the definition of the word law?
I see what you're saying.

773
00:43:42.171 --> 00:43:44.690
But the reality is laws exist.

774
00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:47.930
If you go to Turkey and you have heroin strapped to your back and they catch
you,

775
00:43:47.931 --> 00:43:51.890
that put you in a cage.
You know what I'm saying?
Like,
no,
I don't think it's,

776
00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.400
there's social engineering.
The,
the,
the real question is,

777
00:43:55.401 --> 00:43:58.790
is that social engineering,
is it valid?
You know what I'm saying?
Right.

778
00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:02.140
<v 6>Well,
no,
I think many,
many times the social engineering is not,</v>

779
00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:03.930
<v 5>well,
that's what all the laws are.
Right.</v>

780
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:06.840
And when you agree they're all social engineering yet don't do heroin because we

781
00:44:06.841 --> 00:44:07.680
don't want heroin.
Users

782
00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:08.460
<v 6>don't,</v>

783
00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:13.080
well the idea would be I think that laws like good laws would be laws that were

784
00:44:13.081 --> 00:44:18.081
a natural expression of a kind of a metaphysical function of the universe.

785
00:44:18.151 --> 00:44:18.580
So

786
00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:22.360
<v 5>you say that man,
but then you've got to realize the nature of man,</v>

787
00:44:22.361 --> 00:44:24.700
man is a violent fucking crazy animal.

788
00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:28.900
And if you want to allow the nature of man to express itself in,
in a,
in a,

789
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:32.280
in a truly unfettered way,
you're gonna have a lot of violence,

790
00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:32.680
<v 7>man.</v>

791
00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.160
<v 6>Yeah,
it's called the United States.
I mean,
look at what's happening.</v>

792
00:44:36.190 --> 00:44:39.700
This is the nature of man being allowed to express itself in an unfettered way.

793
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:44.770
It's just being done from,
it's being done from a a on a massive global level.

794
00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:49.180
<v 7>I agree.
And I disagree because as individuals know,
as individuals,</v>

795
00:44:49.181 --> 00:44:52.840
most of the day is filled with very little violence in comparison to what life

796
00:44:52.841 --> 00:44:55.840
would've been like 10,000 years ago,
life 10,000 years ago.
The,

797
00:44:55.841 --> 00:44:58.810
by the time you got to be orange,
you are missing a hand or something.

798
00:44:58.850 --> 00:45:02.450
So fucking aero holes in you if you made it through,
you know,

799
00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:07.000
giant fucking machete mark in your head that you are experiencing violence

800
00:45:07.210 --> 00:45:10.910
around every corner just to stay alive.
I think,
you know,

801
00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.190
laws and all the things that are in place that a lot of people wouldn't agree

802
00:45:15.191 --> 00:45:17.740
with.
You know,
even some drug smuggling laws.

803
00:45:17.741 --> 00:45:20.980
I think you need some sort of regulation on these assholes that want to come in

804
00:45:20.981 --> 00:45:23.980
here and sell poisonous shit that makes you addicted

805
00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.330
<v 6>to know the are a another way to look at it might be with your child.</v>

806
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:32.100
You've got certain rules that you have with your kids where you have to tell

807
00:45:32.101 --> 00:45:35.490
them not to go into the med medicine cabinet and eat these things because they

808
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:38.100
can't regulate themselves and they'll,
they'll die from it.

809
00:45:38.101 --> 00:45:42.010
And those laws are obviously necessary in there.
They're good.
Right.

810
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:47.030
But what I'm saying is there's so many laws that aren't necessary.

811
00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.540
Yeah.
There we're in agreement on that core profit to,
you know,

812
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:53.700
that its laws that are designed to yeah.

813
00:45:53.701 --> 00:45:57.190
We are in agreement that it took to rake money in to,
you know,

814
00:45:57.210 --> 00:46:02.010
the prison industrial complex.
It's,
it's,
these are the,
a lot of these laws,

815
00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.790
oh,
help make a lot of people a lot of money.

816
00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.550
<v 7>And when you say prison industrial complex with a lot of people are not gonna</v>

817
00:46:07.551 --> 00:46:10.820
understand that statement.
So just tell people what the fuck that is.

818
00:46:10.930 --> 00:46:14.260
<v 6>Well the eye,
well basically you know,
running a prison as a business,</v>

819
00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.230
<v 7>well don't know is that a huge percentage of the prisons in this country are</v>

820
00:46:18.231 --> 00:46:21.140
private.
Their own,
their companies and they profit.

821
00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.540
They make money off of how many people are in prison.

822
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:28.250
I mean it's to even hear that and think that somehow somehow that got passed and

823
00:46:28.251 --> 00:46:30.620
they allowed that.
And when we're talking about slavery earlier,

824
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.900
I mean how is that any different than owning people?
Yeah,

825
00:46:32.901 --> 00:46:36.350
they fucked up before they became slaves,
but then once they fucked up,

826
00:46:36.351 --> 00:46:38.750
they became slaves and you're making money off of them.

827
00:46:38.751 --> 00:46:42.230
You make money off them being in there.
You try,
you charge more,
you know,

828
00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:43.730
debate based on how many are in there.

829
00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.870
<v 6>I heard this statistic,</v>

830
00:46:44.871 --> 00:46:49.430
there are now more black people in prison than there were slaves.

831
00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.790
Now I don't know if that's true or it's true.
Yeah.
Yeah,
I read that.
Yeah.

832
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:54.480
So I mean and,

833
00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:58.910
and like how many of those people in prison are there for doing something really

834
00:46:58.911 --> 00:47:02.750
awful?
Like what's the percentage of violent crimes versus nonviolent offenders?

835
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:08.050
And then cause like the people who are in there for like rape and beating people

836
00:47:08.061 --> 00:47:10.700
and doing crazy shit,
of course they should be behind bars.

837
00:47:10.701 --> 00:47:12.740
There needs to be some justice invoked.

838
00:47:12.741 --> 00:47:14.930
Cause some people can't defend themselves obviously.

839
00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:20.230
But people are in jail because they smoke some weed and their car is this,

840
00:47:20.690 --> 00:47:22.880
this is not all prisons though,
right?
Cause I mean,

841
00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.690
aren't they always saying that?
Prison's a care turning away people because as

842
00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:31.720
<v 7>you know,
they just don't have no,
but there's like county prisons and there's,</v>

843
00:47:31.721 --> 00:47:34.270
there's different prisons,
you know,
I don't know what percentage,

844
00:47:34.271 --> 00:47:38.410
just not all prisons,
all of them are,
couldn't be.
But it's a huge number.

845
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.430
It's a huge number.
And they're making new ones all the time.
That's the key.

846
00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:45.010
The fucking,
when the economy goes south,
man,
people start going to crime.

847
00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:47.230
It's just how it goes.
I mean,
it's,
it's normal.

848
00:47:47.231 --> 00:47:51.040
I don't know what the increase in prime has been since the economy went to shit,

849
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.270
but it's kind of be a couple of percent or something.
I mean,

850
00:47:53.271 --> 00:47:56.500
it's just what happens and that to them,
that's,
that's numbers,
dollar,

851
00:47:56.501 --> 00:48:00.280
dollar bills.
Y'all stuffed them in those cages and start raking in the cash.

852
00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:03.310
It's just so weird to know that that's a real thing.

853
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.500
<v 6>Well,
I mean it's,
yeah,
it's,
it's a form of vampirism.
You know,</v>

854
00:48:07.501 --> 00:48:11.310
you're basically like sucking people's life energies out of them,

855
00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:16.050
converting it into money and then using that money to like buy nice things for

856
00:48:16.051 --> 00:48:16.980
your beautiful wife.

857
00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:21.060
<v 7>I can't tell you how much I'm disappointed in Obama as a spokesman,
as a,</v>

858
00:48:21.070 --> 00:48:24.500
as a representative of us.
And you know,
not,

859
00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.960
I don't know what's going on in the world.

860
00:48:26.961 --> 00:48:29.180
I don't know exactly what happened with those.

861
00:48:29.181 --> 00:48:32.690
Was Osama bin Ladin or any of this,
why we're bombing Pakistan?

862
00:48:32.691 --> 00:48:36.710
Why we're involved in,
I don't know.
Who knows Michael for our own benefit.

863
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:40.310
How come this motherfucker,
a guy who came from a single mom,

864
00:48:40.311 --> 00:48:45.311
how come he can't step up and figure out some way to get people to put funding

865
00:48:46.881 --> 00:48:50.630
into horrible neighborhoods to try to make the system better,

866
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:55.760
to try to get more cops into those neighborhoods to try to get more teachers

867
00:48:55.761 --> 00:48:58.580
into the schools that are more qualified to pay them more,

868
00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:03.320
to set up community outreach programs for kids who don't have fathers and set up

869
00:49:03.321 --> 00:49:03.951
like,
you know,

870
00:49:03.951 --> 00:49:08.270
mentoring things and you know like local clubs where they can play sports and

871
00:49:08.410 --> 00:49:08.630
you know,

872
00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:11.630
they can have friends and where they have something to fucking look forward to

873
00:49:11.631 --> 00:49:15.770
and you will create an infinitely better country.
Infinitely better.

874
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:19.550
Because our number one problem is people who suck.
And a lot of people who suck,

875
00:49:19.551 --> 00:49:23.510
just need,
needed love.
They needed something,
they needed guidance,
they needed,

876
00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.420
and I'm not saying we're supposed to be nanny state in the world,

877
00:49:26.421 --> 00:49:30.890
but I am saying there's a certain amount of people that are born in this country

878
00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:34.790
for sure are going to be fucked.
Why can't we help them?
Well,

879
00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.710
if you really wanted to make this world better,

880
00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:38.150
wouldn't that be one of the first things you do?

881
00:49:38.270 --> 00:49:43.270
And in comparison to how much fucking money we spend just blowing shit up in a

882
00:49:43.701 --> 00:49:47.780
bunch of places where we're never going to go.
Yeah.
Compared to that,

883
00:49:47.810 --> 00:49:49.310
the fucking money would be nothing.

884
00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:52.830
<v 6>There's an article in salon.com which addresses the point you're saying it's</v>

885
00:49:52.831 --> 00:49:55.500
there today.
I believe that says that,
uh,

886
00:49:55.501 --> 00:49:59.820
if instead of the money it costs us to kill bin Laden would have paid for

887
00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.760
college and free healthcare for everyone in the country.

888
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:06.680
<v 7>God Damn.
It just doesn't seem right.
It's still never seen,</v>

889
00:50:07.310 --> 00:50:08.690
but it's true.
It's just because the,

890
00:50:08.691 --> 00:50:12.530
the military industrial complex has a huge influence on what happens in this

891
00:50:12.531 --> 00:50:12.831
country.

892
00:50:12.831 --> 00:50:16.940
It's what Eisenhower warned about when he left office and that famous speech and

893
00:50:16.941 --> 00:50:20.120
that's just the way it goes,
man.
It is the reality and that reality,

894
00:50:20.121 --> 00:50:21.240
despite wikileaks,

895
00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:25.070
despite anything that gets released about any fucked up thing that happens in

896
00:50:25.071 --> 00:50:28.070
the world,
it's still seems to keep moving in the same.
It doesn't

897
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.930
<v 1>seem to be any,
any,
any changing.</v>

898
00:50:30.140 --> 00:50:33.830
<v 6>Yeah,
it definitely doesn't.
I mean,
well you can't change,
I mean their,</v>

899
00:50:33.831 --> 00:50:36.350
their way to change it.
It almost changed.

900
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:40.820
It almost changed that the summer of love when people were fucking blasted on

901
00:50:40.821 --> 00:50:45.500
psychedelics links,
things were changing.
There was a shift,
man.

902
00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:48.940
There was a real shift happening and everybody got on speed and the ship became

903
00:50:48.941 --> 00:50:53.870
illegal and now we're all like self absorbed lunatics.

904
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:58.100
You know,
we're all individually only taking care of ourselves.

905
00:50:58.101 --> 00:51:03.101
Our minds are focused 100% on getting to work on time and that's one of the fun

906
00:51:03.490 --> 00:51:07.670
was interesting things to do during rush hour is look around at all the people

907
00:51:07.671 --> 00:51:10.820
in the cars and you'll just see people in a dream sleepwalking.

908
00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.550
They're all asleep and that the dream they're living in is that they're the only

909
00:51:13.551 --> 00:51:17.240
person on the planet that's all there is.
Just them,
nothing else.

910
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:19.760
And we've all trained ourselves to not even look at each other,

911
00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:22.970
to not even say hello,
you want to freak somebody out these days.

912
00:51:22.970 --> 00:51:27.620
All you have to do is go say good morning in Los Angeles.
I don't know man.

913
00:51:27.621 --> 00:51:31.100
Completely different man.
When I went back to Columbus,
Ohio,
it was just like,
hi,

914
00:51:31.101 --> 00:51:35.030
hi,
everywhere.
But go to go to go to an airport.
Columbus was super friendly.

915
00:51:35.150 --> 00:51:39.740
I haven't seen there's a,
there's a,
a program thing inside of us that is not,

916
00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:43.190
we're not acknowledging each other at the level that we need to.

917
00:51:43.191 --> 00:51:44.960
And the Internet's changed that to some degree.

918
00:51:44.961 --> 00:51:49.850
It's opened up more lines of dialogue between people,
but one of the ones.

919
00:51:49.851 --> 00:51:53.420
So what I'm saying is the reason this isn't changing is because we're not

920
00:51:53.421 --> 00:51:54.254
changing.
We're,

921
00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:58.130
we're moving more and more into ourselves instead of connecting with people

922
00:51:58.131 --> 00:52:01.670
around us.
And um,
during the 60 psychedelics,
they,

923
00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:06.260
we all know they have an effect that causes a kind of weird connect empathy to

924
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:10.760
come.
It come into your mind and a weird connection can happen.
Uh,

925
00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:14.240
when you're around people and you feel connected to the whole universe,

926
00:52:14.241 --> 00:52:15.770
you feel like I'm not just me,

927
00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:20.720
I'm a representative of an infinite field of energy.
You know,
and,

928
00:52:20.721 --> 00:52:24.660
and people have forgotten this.
And so because of that,
we're all living life.

929
00:52:24.730 --> 00:52:25.870
<v 1>Hello learning.
And again,</v>

930
00:52:26.170 --> 00:52:29.500
I think right now more so than any time in my life I hear so I could bug

931
00:52:29.501 --> 00:52:34.120
discussion more than at anytime in my life.
This is a big,
big,
big,
big,
big,
big,

932
00:52:34.121 --> 00:52:37.090
big difference between now and say when I started comedy,

933
00:52:37.091 --> 00:52:41.160
like 1994 people would occasionally joke about doing mushrooms.
Ha,

934
00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:43.490
what is he doing?
Mushrooms,
Huh?
Yeah.
You know,

935
00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:47.410
but no one was like calm and calm with trip reports.
You Know Chris Markus,

936
00:52:47.411 --> 00:52:48.580
our buddy Chris from the flashlight,

937
00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.600
he went on a little vacation the other day and was telling me how beautiful it

938
00:52:52.601 --> 00:52:54.370
was.
And you know,
you come back as a,

939
00:52:54.371 --> 00:52:58.600
a better person when you come back as literally like I said this on stage about

940
00:52:58.601 --> 00:53:00.730
the guy who's got those,
those um,
billboards.

941
00:53:01.350 --> 00:53:05.080
It's his May 21st Jesus is coming and I'm like on May 22nd we're going to find

942
00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:08.260
that fuck and we're going to force feed him mushrooms.
I'm like,

943
00:53:08.261 --> 00:53:09.400
because Jesus is coming.

944
00:53:09.480 --> 00:53:14.320
How do you can see Jesus see Jesus and Buddha and Santa Clause.

945
00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:19.060
You can see anything that anyone ever thought of ever plus stuff.

946
00:53:19.061 --> 00:53:20.340
You could have never imagined.

947
00:53:20.341 --> 00:53:24.910
You could see Jesus literally can see Jesus take seven grams,

948
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:26.220
take seven grams of mushrooms.

949
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:28.170
<v 7>You'll see Jesus taught this in the Bible,</v>

950
00:53:28.171 --> 00:53:31.140
that there's going to be many false prophets and that the day will,

951
00:53:31.141 --> 00:53:34.560
no one will ever know the day it's just going to come.
Yeah.
The,
as they said,

952
00:53:34.561 --> 00:53:38.040
women are second class citizens and they can don't slavery.
That's a silly book.

953
00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:40.710
Okay.
You know,
everybody would go crazy about the Bible man,
the,

954
00:53:40.800 --> 00:53:43.920
but it's in the Bible.
I've lived my life by the Bible.
But um,
listen,

955
00:53:43.921 --> 00:53:46.920
here's the bottom line about the Bible.
You're not even reading the Bible stupid.

956
00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:47.231
Well,

957
00:53:47.231 --> 00:53:51.480
you're reading is a version of the Bible that was translated first into Latin

958
00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:54.780
than in the Greek,
the ancient Hebrew version of the Bible.

959
00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:56.640
They don't even know all the words.

960
00:53:56.790 --> 00:54:00.120
They only know a certain percentage of the words in ancient Hebrew.

961
00:54:00.121 --> 00:54:02.250
Like they literally don't know what the words mean.

962
00:54:02.251 --> 00:54:05.850
And part of it's because letters were also numbers in ancient Hebrew,

963
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.490
like the letter a is also the number one.

964
00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:13.610
So like there was a certain numerical value to words that we don't understand

965
00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.280
right there.
You're getting the interpretations,

966
00:54:17.281 --> 00:54:21.150
the worst version of the grapevine ever.
And I'm on top of that.

967
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.860
The oldest version of the Bible,

968
00:54:22.861 --> 00:54:27.861
which is the Dead Sea scrolls is so fucking crazy that they don't even use it.

969
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:33.370
It's just so filled with these vague stories of of trips and you are foes and

970
00:54:34.081 --> 00:54:37.260
visitations and all sorts of nutty shit that doesn't work.

971
00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:41.010
According to John Marco Allegro,
the with the Dead Sea Scrolls is all about,

972
00:54:41.130 --> 00:54:45.180
was them hiding their history of psychedelic mushroom use and they were trying

973
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:47.190
to hide it from the Romans in stories.

974
00:54:47.340 --> 00:54:49.350
And the older you go back in these stories,

975
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:52.740
the more you get to the original version of the story and that that's what it

976
00:54:52.741 --> 00:54:53.281
was all about.

977
00:54:53.281 --> 00:54:55.890
These guys were tripping their balls off and it totally makes sense.

978
00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.050
Have you were a bunch of idiots.
It was living,
you know,

979
00:54:58.051 --> 00:55:01.000
7,000 years ago or whatever the fuck they were and you know,
you're,

980
00:55:01.001 --> 00:55:02.820
you're living with your stupid leather shoes.

981
00:55:02.821 --> 00:55:07.170
He got all sewn on you and you know you've got some goofy ass hemp clothing on,

982
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.480
you know you're a dope,
you don't know what's going on.

983
00:55:09.481 --> 00:55:12.390
You look at the stars every night and you wonder when the gods are kind of rain

984
00:55:12.391 --> 00:55:17.190
fire from the sky and then you've stumbled across some mushrooms in the end.
You,

985
00:55:17.191 --> 00:55:18.290
you ate them and,
and,

986
00:55:18.291 --> 00:55:23.291
and eight and way too many and had some insane super psychedelic when tunnel

987
00:55:24.751 --> 00:55:29.751
vortex tornado experience where the whole universe is like a giant ball of yarn

988
00:55:31.471 --> 00:55:36.471
and each strand of the ball is like a hyper segmented with billions of planets

989
00:55:37.441 --> 00:55:39.780
and lives and trees and water.

990
00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:43.470
And you can see that for five or six hours and then come back.
You're going to,

991
00:55:43.471 --> 00:55:45.870
you're not going to want the Romans to know about that shit man.

992
00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:50.070
You're going to want to hide all that stuff.
That's what the Bible really is.

993
00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:53.790
What the Bible is,
is a trip report.
Yeah.
That's what the Bible is.

994
00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:56.410
<v 6>And that's really important man.
And,
and,
and that's the,</v>

995
00:55:56.411 --> 00:56:01.310
that's an important thing for people to know.
And that's the,
I think the,
the,
the,

996
00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.120
where things have gone wrong.

997
00:56:03.121 --> 00:56:06.840
Because one cool thing about the people who wrote the Dead Sea Scrolls,

998
00:56:06.841 --> 00:56:09.330
whoever the fuck they were is that they were,

999
00:56:09.570 --> 00:56:13.660
were courageous enough to try to express that experiences that were worried or

1000
00:56:13.710 --> 00:56:16.830
reality.
And now when people take a psychedelic,

1001
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:22.280
they mark it off is some kind of dream or an imaginary thing that happened to

1002
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:23.891
that's not real.

1003
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:28.891
So they pretend that this alternate dimension that seems to exist and exactly on

1004
00:56:30.311 --> 00:56:34.480
top of ours and is filled with hyper dimensional,

1005
00:56:34.481 --> 00:56:38.980
super intelligent beings that throughout time have been called aliens are

1006
00:56:38.981 --> 00:56:42.250
angels,
are elves or dwarves or whatever.
The fact that it,

1007
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:47.050
the fact that these people tried to articulate that they tried to bring

1008
00:56:47.051 --> 00:56:49.300
something back from that place here.

1009
00:56:49.510 --> 00:56:53.020
And just the effect of bringing the,
the,
the,
uh,

1010
00:56:53.021 --> 00:56:56.770
close linguistic description of that place onto this planet,

1011
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:59.830
look at the fucking change it caused.
It created a religion.

1012
00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.260
We date time based on that.

1013
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:06.850
Our current with the way we look at time is after Jesus's birth,
all that stuff.

1014
00:57:06.851 --> 00:57:11.680
It's like the,
the power that comes from being able to swim out into the,

1015
00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:16.090
uh,
hypersonic waters of the psychedelic experience.

1016
00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:19.720
Keep your fucking head about you.
Look at what you're seeing.

1017
00:57:19.721 --> 00:57:22.900
Try to understand it in a logical way.
Instead of being like,

1018
00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.170
I'm Bardian try to understand it.
What is this?

1019
00:57:26.171 --> 00:57:28.300
Is this a projection of what's inside of you?

1020
00:57:28.510 --> 00:57:30.760
Or are you seeing something that's really there?

1021
00:57:30.761 --> 00:57:32.320
And if you're seeing something that's really there,

1022
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:36.160
what are those symbols you're looking at?
What are those?
Is that myon?

1023
00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:38.140
Is that Sanskrit?
What is that?

1024
00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.070
And the more you try to understand that and really get the message,

1025
00:57:42.071 --> 00:57:44.920
because there was a message over there,
we've all heard it.
You've heard it,

1026
00:57:44.921 --> 00:57:45.730
I've heard it.

1027
00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:50.730
The message is the universe loves you and your fine and everything's gonna be

1028
00:57:51.521 --> 00:57:56.500
fine.
Don't be scared.
Try to spread love.
Be Positive.

1029
00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:58.150
Embrace the world.

1030
00:57:58.151 --> 00:58:03.010
Embrace your fucking neighbors and let go of the fear that's ruining your life.

1031
00:58:03.130 --> 00:58:06.580
That's the message.
That message gets interpreted in a bunch of different ways.

1032
00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:08.410
Buddhism,
Christianity,
whatever.

1033
00:58:08.680 --> 00:58:12.340
But it's not like people are supposed to stop bringing that message back.

1034
00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:13.383
That's a thing.

1035
00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:16.370
<v 7>People don't want to accept that.
That's where that message comes from.</v>

1036
00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:17.391
There's a lot of people,

1037
00:58:17.391 --> 00:58:20.660
when you connect something to the idea of it coming from a mushroom or any type

1038
00:58:20.661 --> 00:58:25.400
of drug IOWASCA whatever,
it inherently devalues the experience.
Like I,

1039
00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.020
I didn't listen to it,

1040
00:58:27.021 --> 00:58:31.520
but apparently Robin quivers from those Howard Stern show went to Peru and I

1041
00:58:31.521 --> 00:58:33.860
heard a lot of talk about it.
But you know,
when I'm in my car,

1042
00:58:33.861 --> 00:58:37.220
I never know what episode I'm listening to it.
I didn't catch that one,
you know.

1043
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.880
Um,

1044
00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:42.080
but apparently she went to Peru to engage in an Iowasca ceremony and they were

1045
00:58:42.081 --> 00:58:44.150
giving her a hard time because she's like a Vegan.
They're like,
what?

1046
00:58:44.151 --> 00:58:47.180
You won't even drink milk and we'll take this fucking shit.
Which is very funny.

1047
00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.250
But um,
but you know,

1048
00:58:49.251 --> 00:58:52.890
a lot of people will do or poo poo and her experience and um,

1049
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:56.990
that experience,
the Iowasca experienced the mushroom experience.
You know,

1050
00:58:56.991 --> 00:59:00.620
everybody,
everybody that is religious wants to believe in God.

1051
00:59:00.830 --> 00:59:05.830
What I'm telling you is I can show you something that represents God for sure.

1052
00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:09.380
You can meet what God is and I'm not saying it's God your meeting,

1053
00:59:09.381 --> 00:59:11.090
but you can meet what God is,

1054
00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:16.240
what God is is perfect and all knowing and all embracing and loving and wise and

1055
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:20.330
and constantly around you all the time.
Well when you take mushrooms,

1056
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:22.280
that's what you,
that's what you feel.

1057
00:59:22.281 --> 00:59:25.670
You really feel God and are not saying that is God that you're communicating

1058
00:59:25.671 --> 00:59:26.970
with or what God is or what,

1059
00:59:26.971 --> 00:59:29.930
what are the what even the concept of God when you say God,

1060
00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:34.350
all the sudden it says male hierarchy point of you know,

1061
00:59:34.370 --> 00:59:38.510
point of reference where you think of like one alpha that controls all but it's

1062
00:59:38.511 --> 00:59:42.230
not that God is more like everything

1063
00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:42.820
<v 6>it says.</v>

1064
00:59:42.820 --> 00:59:47.820
It's like a super dimensional glob of it's every brilliance and intelligence.

1065
00:59:50.351 --> 00:59:54.370
It's this,
it's always,
and also it's,
it's constantly changing.

1066
00:59:54.371 --> 00:59:56.980
That's the other thing like it's,
it's like trying to even talk about it.

1067
00:59:56.981 --> 01:00:00.130
It's like trying to talk about like a spinning slot machine.

1068
01:00:00.131 --> 01:00:04.840
It's like it's constantly like morphing and shifting and it's so fucking potent.

1069
01:00:04.841 --> 01:00:07.270
Whatever it is that we're run offs of it.

1070
01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:10.330
Like when you see water running down your windshield and like,

1071
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:15.160
streams of water will break into little globs of water.
That's what we are.

1072
01:00:15.161 --> 01:00:19.330
We're just a little broken off globs of super intelligence that have taken on

1073
01:00:19.331 --> 01:00:22.900
these personalities and think that we're individuals and you know what else

1074
01:00:22.901 --> 01:00:24.430
breaks off in that fucking thing?

1075
01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:28.720
Elfs hyper dimensional things that aren't necessarily out to love you.

1076
01:00:28.721 --> 01:00:33.721
And like there really is like there are beings out there that are um,

1077
01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.330
I don't know man,
like super intelligent toddlers,

1078
01:00:37.331 --> 01:00:39.160
I think mechanic talked about it.
They're like,

1079
01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:41.530
they're like baby God or something.
Okay,

1080
01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:44.590
<v 7>here's a,
the devil's advocate point of view,
please.</v>

1081
01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.650
How do you not know that those thoughts,

1082
01:00:47.651 --> 01:00:51.130
those demons just represent thoughts in your mind.

1083
01:00:51.310 --> 01:00:56.310
And perhaps what that experience is entirely is you contacting your own thoughts

1084
01:00:57.341 --> 01:01:02.020
and ideas and dreams and hopes and expression without the context of reality

1085
01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.590
attached to them.
So without the idea of,
you know,

1086
01:01:05.591 --> 01:01:07.930
what you did that you're embarrassed about,

1087
01:01:07.931 --> 01:01:12.310
that made you weird about your underwear when you were 13,
you know,

1088
01:01:12.311 --> 01:01:17.230
instead of that maybe it manifests itself in almost a living thing.
It almost,

1089
01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:17.741
you know,

1090
01:01:17.741 --> 01:01:21.670
that project you're seeing these when you saying you are beings out there that

1091
01:01:21.671 --> 01:01:24.430
are fucking with you,
maybe those are things that you've let grow when you're

1092
01:01:24.450 --> 01:01:25.290
<v 6>mind.
Well,
yeah,</v>

1093
01:01:25.291 --> 01:01:28.650
I mean I think that that's the modern take on it and I think that that's one

1094
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:33.690
useful handle to like get her get,
get to,
to like grab a hold of an ideal.

1095
01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:34.524
I'd be considered

1096
01:01:34.570 --> 01:01:35.860
<v 7>when you were in there,
when you,
when you,</v>

1097
01:01:35.861 --> 01:01:38.830
you said you had experienced experience.
Like these are projection mechanisms,

1098
01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:43.960
the yeah,
that what you're seeing literally is like that thoughts are live there.

1099
01:01:43.961 --> 01:01:47.650
They're real things that they look,
you've ever heard the possibility,

1100
01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:52.680
I mean the discussion rather of the idea that aliens will come through the mind

1101
01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:55.900
and that they're not going to manifest themselves in a real form in that when

1102
01:01:55.901 --> 01:01:59.500
you think of the imagination and when you think of dreams and what we have is

1103
01:01:59.501 --> 01:02:03.670
some weird,
slippery sort of experience that we can't completely control.

1104
01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:06.520
But what if that dimension of dreams,

1105
01:02:06.521 --> 01:02:10.090
that sleep dimension that you tap into and all your neurochemistry starts

1106
01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:13.240
flowing between the blood brain barrier.
While you're in heavy rem sleep,

1107
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:15.370
what does that is in fact another dimension.

1108
01:02:15.550 --> 01:02:19.470
What of that is in fact a world and that is where aliens will contact through.

1109
01:02:19.620 --> 01:02:23.760
They will contact you through this spiritual dimension instead of a physical

1110
01:02:23.761 --> 01:02:25.500
dimension.
Yeah.
Well,
if that's the case,

1111
01:02:25.501 --> 01:02:28.890
and if you think about taking mushrooms and these these l show up,

1112
01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:34.310
it is possible that negative things that you've created in your own life,

1113
01:02:34.890 --> 01:02:39.120
shitty choices or bad energy that you've set forth and then nurtured and and

1114
01:02:39.121 --> 01:02:42.540
repressed and put it down and tried to deny it and all of these different things

1115
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:45.780
that people do to sort of rationalize creepy things that they're doing in their

1116
01:02:45.781 --> 01:02:46.440
lives.

1117
01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:51.440
What if those things manifest themselves as living organisms in the free pool of

1118
01:02:51.451 --> 01:02:52.284
your mind?

1119
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:53.660
<v 0>Yeah.
You know,
that's actually,</v>

1120
01:02:53.661 --> 01:02:57.600
I think fucking Carl Young said that exact same,

1121
01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:00.410
<v 7>I met Carl Young this weekend.
Maybe he's a man,</v>

1122
01:03:00.411 --> 01:03:04.300
a crazy guy who took ship 6.8 grams of mushrooms and told me he was crying.

1123
01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:05.213
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1124
01:03:06.050 --> 01:03:09.300
<v 7>This guy comes up to me and he goes,
he goes,
I need to talk to you.</v>

1125
01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.330
I have information that I'm sure you don't know about.
I go,
how can you be sure?

1126
01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:14.100
And he goes,
I just know.
I just know.

1127
01:03:14.101 --> 01:03:16.200
I just know I tried to talk to Brian Red band about it,

1128
01:03:16.201 --> 01:03:20.830
but he replied to my email with some stupid joke.
I go,
that sounds like Brian.

1129
01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.320
I want to give you knuckles for that.
So then,
then hold boy goes,
I really,

1130
01:03:25.321 --> 01:03:28.260
I've been doing psychedelic research.
I need to get this information for you.

1131
01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.650
Listen,
it's going to sound crazy.
I used to be in another life.
I was Carl Young.

1132
01:03:32.430 --> 01:03:35.970
I go,
how can you be sure?
And he goes,
I've seen things that you've never seen.

1133
01:03:35.971 --> 01:03:36.420
I go,

1134
01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:39.700
how can you know that this is ridiculous so you get to confidence on get out of

1135
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:41.050
here.
And I kicked him out of there.

1136
01:03:41.110 --> 01:03:45.690
<v 0>Right?
That guy I was,
do you remember?
Yeah.
I got to find that email.
That's crazy.</v>

1137
01:03:45.740 --> 01:03:48.170
<v 7>I talked about him on the podcast,
on the plane with Sam.
Triple a did,</v>

1138
01:03:48.171 --> 01:03:50.330
but that podcast might suck.
I'm not even going to release it.

1139
01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.050
I might not release it because we were both hung over and tired and we're

1140
01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.670
talking about stupid shit.
So I'm not sure if he's still a little

1141
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:59.780
<v 0>hung over from fucking Joey Dhea is giving me a banana cake.
Yeah.</v>

1142
01:03:59.781 --> 01:04:03.230
I got a text from Brian in capital letters do not eat.

1143
01:04:03.231 --> 01:04:07.820
Joey Diaz is banana bread.
You can never eat edible marijuana.

1144
01:04:07.821 --> 01:04:11.960
That Joey Diaz,
given that as you have thorazine on hand,
don't take that.

1145
01:04:11.961 --> 01:04:12.301
So let's see.

1146
01:04:12.301 --> 01:04:15.680
You have a fucking big hydro German filled with adrenaline that you could stuff

1147
01:04:15.681 --> 01:04:19.850
into your chest up.
Oh Dude.

1148
01:04:19.910 --> 01:04:22.000
Joey Diaz gave me,
uh,
you,
um,

1149
01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:26.120
once gave me like some breath strips I guess is the first time I take in breath

1150
01:04:26.121 --> 01:04:31.100
strips and he was like,
eat two of these.
And I'm like,

1151
01:04:32.070 --> 01:04:36.620
no.
He really tell you,
hey,
I don't tell anybody ever detect more than a quarter.

1152
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:39.830
I hold their hand,
I go,
dude,
listen to me Bro.
Listen to me.
I love you.

1153
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:43.790
Don't take more than a quarter.
Joey likes the,
towards knowing Joey Diaz.

1154
01:04:44.030 --> 01:04:45.020
That's what I did.

1155
01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:49.430
I only took half of one of these knowing him and I was driving home on the

1156
01:04:49.431 --> 01:04:52.780
interstate and I was like,
well,
it's,

1157
01:04:52.810 --> 01:04:56.090
it's definitely the apocalypse world is ending.

1158
01:04:56.090 --> 01:05:00.710
I see that clearly now I'm in the last days and uh,
and um,

1159
01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:04.850
there was a McDonald's and I was going to stop my car and run to the Mcdonald's

1160
01:05:04.851 --> 01:05:07.730
ticket,
a burger because traffic wasn't moving.

1161
01:05:07.731 --> 01:05:11.630
That's how bad the logic was working in my mind.
Uh,
just get them fucking,

1162
01:05:11.631 --> 01:05:15.860
I know I can make it there to get a diet coke and back.
But anyway,
I get home,

1163
01:05:15.861 --> 01:05:20.020
I'm having the most terrible marijuana trip.
I'm laying in bed.
I'm like,

1164
01:05:20.021 --> 01:05:24.730
oh my God,
the world's in my heart's pounding phone rings,
phone rings,
Joey Diaz,

1165
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:27.860
I answered.
He's like,
welcome to my house,
motherfucker.

1166
01:05:28.570 --> 01:05:33.530
[inaudible]

1167
01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:38.200
he thought you took all two of them so he knew the no go into recording.
Yeah.

1168
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:41.950
I suppose you just surmise that it's so crazy.
You have his buddies.

1169
01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.730
I got the Listerine's the asset thing and there was like a few of them in there

1170
01:05:45.731 --> 01:05:48.300
and I guess they all melted together.
Do you remember that?
I did that.

1171
01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.290
I did that one guy took like a bunch of them ever did.
He never smoked weed.

1172
01:05:53.291 --> 01:05:56.970
He never ate wheat and he was like his first time trying it.
So Joey,
you know,

1173
01:05:57.010 --> 01:05:58.110
gave him some entity.

1174
01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.000
There was like a lot in there and they had melted together into one and got a

1175
01:06:01.001 --> 01:06:02.020
massive panic attack.

1176
01:06:02.021 --> 01:06:04.420
I think the guy called him the ambulance get called by one one.

1177
01:06:04.421 --> 01:06:06.940
He had a panic attack.
Yeah,
we'd see.
That's the thing man,

1178
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:10.690
there needs to be a special now I want one like when you press a button on your

1179
01:06:10.691 --> 01:06:12.340
phone when you get directed,

1180
01:06:12.341 --> 01:06:17.341
like have you eaten edible marijuana press was Cherry Garcia someone he can calm

1181
01:06:17.871 --> 01:06:19.400
me down.
Yeah,
it's just music.

1182
01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.260
<v 7>Well what people don't realize is that there's cannabinoid receptors in your</v>

1183
01:06:23.261 --> 01:06:27.490
mind that are established for two things that come out during like runner's high

1184
01:06:27.491 --> 01:06:29.050
and you're,
you know,
and some other things.

1185
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:32.410
But also they're there to like to receive marijuana.

1186
01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.440
They're the receive to receive all the shit that's in marijuana.

1187
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:40.150
Marijuana easily could be responsible for human behavioral development.

1188
01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:42.700
Could easily,
we could have a long time ago,

1189
01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:45.250
I've had some sort of a symbiotic relationship with marijuana.

1190
01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.300
I mean you look at the characteristics that it's all about like being loving.

1191
01:06:49.301 --> 01:06:54.280
It makes people kinder and friendlier and Sillier and less threatening and more

1192
01:06:54.281 --> 01:06:57.380
insecure.
So it makes you like less cocky,
you know?

1193
01:06:57.390 --> 01:07:00.910
It's all like good things for society,
you know,
and they,

1194
01:07:00.911 --> 01:07:04.420
human use of it has gone.
I was at this,
Oh God,
I've got to tell you about this.

1195
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:07.920
I know the history of cannabis because I was at a place in Toronto.
They had,

1196
01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:13.150
I went to this nutty fucking place.
It is Valhalla for pothead comedians.

1197
01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:18.250
It's a head shop and in the back room they have a comedy club.
Cool Dude.

1198
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.470
It's called Clint.
I probably shouldn't say what it's called.

1199
01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:24.250
I think it's on the DL.
But anyway,
you go there and they had this big thing,

1200
01:07:24.260 --> 01:07:28.480
the history of cannabis for 4,000 years old evidence of cannabis use in China.

1201
01:07:28.481 --> 01:07:29.920
And it goes like throughout human history,

1202
01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.340
how long people have been using marijuana and they're selling bongs or sell them

1203
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:34.270
like pipes and shit.

1204
01:07:34.510 --> 01:07:38.050
And then you'd go into the back room and they have a comedy club.
That's cool.

1205
01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.310
They have a comedy club dude,
and you go on stage and everyone,

1206
01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.540
I went onstage and sparked up a joint and immediately when I got it,

1207
01:07:43.570 --> 01:07:48.220
it's a full hot box.
You can't see the back of it.
It's filled with weed smoke.

1208
01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:50.350
And the whole time I was on stage I did like an hour.

1209
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.680
The whole time I'm up there,
dudes are hitting a bong and they're,

1210
01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:58.610
they're passing joints and it's fucking crazy.
Too much.
Like,
too much,

1211
01:07:58.611 --> 01:08:00.250
too much,
too much my voice.

1212
01:08:00.251 --> 01:08:01.900
Well that's one of the reasons why I'm coughing today.

1213
01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:05.490
I think I'm just breathing in that.
Yeah,
that's Sam.

1214
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:08.770
Sam totally lost his voice almost.
He's like,
yeah,
yeah,

1215
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:10.990
that motherfucker needs ventilation for sure.

1216
01:08:11.650 --> 01:08:14.170
But my voice was like really hot and red,

1217
01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.340
but it didn't affect me the next night when I did the UFC,

1218
01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.620
it didn't bother me at all,
but it was hot and,

1219
01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:20.660
and like I remember getting out of there going,
God,

1220
01:08:20.661 --> 01:08:22.940
I got to go outside and breathe.
And then the cool air of,

1221
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:26.150
I mean literally there was no oxygen in the room,
it was just pot smoke.

1222
01:08:26.390 --> 01:08:29.480
It was fucking crazy.
And the way Toronto is right now,

1223
01:08:29.481 --> 01:08:33.350
apparently there's some sort of a situation where they had a law to make it

1224
01:08:33.351 --> 01:08:35.840
illegal,
but the law was ruled unconstitutional.

1225
01:08:35.841 --> 01:08:39.890
So that in the 90 days between the,
the next revision of the law,

1226
01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:44.810
it's basically in limbo.
So it's like flea on pot,
sort of legal,
sort of,

1227
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.800
you know what I mean?

1228
01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.650
Like they could probably bust your balls if they wanted to and lock you up and

1229
01:08:48.651 --> 01:08:50.860
they would,
you'd,
you know,
who knows dude?
Yeah.

1230
01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.700
<v 6>Did they,
at the history of marijuana a thing,</v>

1231
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:57.750
did they talk about the white mommies and China?
What does that,
no,

1232
01:08:58.290 --> 01:09:00.570
in fucking China,

1233
01:09:00.810 --> 01:09:05.460
they found these white mommies that are Caucasian mommies.
Oh,

1234
01:09:05.530 --> 01:09:08.940
you know about that?
They had like blonde hair and they had fucking weed on it.

1235
01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.620
Yes.
Yes.
And they were like tall.
Yeah.
Tall Caucasian mommy's,
yeah.

1236
01:09:13.621 --> 01:09:18.480
With marijuana.
And we,
yeah,
we use that data to,
um,
I was like,

1237
01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:21.510
I don't,
I don't know.
I'll fuck it up.
I said [inaudible] thousand years.

1238
01:09:21.511 --> 01:09:25.080
It was long,
long time ago.
But the funny thing is on the Internet,

1239
01:09:25.081 --> 01:09:25.741
you can look it up.

1240
01:09:25.741 --> 01:09:29.430
There's a national geographic thing about these mummies and there's a scientist,

1241
01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:33.480
uh,
being like,
um,
I don't like saying this,

1242
01:09:33.481 --> 01:09:36.540
but there was marijuana on those

1243
01:09:36.630 --> 01:09:40.590
<v 7>mommies.
Like it's a four years.</v>

1244
01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.500
I don't like saying that.
Yeah.
I don't know.
How could people,

1245
01:09:43.501 --> 01:09:48.501
why are people so reluctant to admit the positive affects that all these debt or

1246
01:09:49.651 --> 01:09:50.850
the effects,
the,
the,

1247
01:09:50.851 --> 01:09:55.560
the need that people have for all these different intoxicants?
Why is it mean,

1248
01:09:55.830 --> 01:09:59.930
why is it so mainstream to dismiss it?
Is that some Nancy Reagan Shit,

1249
01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:00.773
the stove left?
Yeah.

1250
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.420
<v 6>Well I think it's older than that.
I mean,
God,
we kept like,</v>

1251
01:10:03.630 --> 01:10:07.350
isn't it like the people who came over here for in the beginning were super

1252
01:10:07.351 --> 01:10:12.330
religious and they had all these like ideas about sex and uh,
Eh,
uh,

1253
01:10:12.331 --> 01:10:17.331
intoxication that were really super strict and we're their distant ancestors.

1254
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:21.600
And somehow that line of guilt still remains.
Where if people,

1255
01:10:21.601 --> 01:10:26.601
like I only drink after 5:00 PM I'll only smoke marijuana after four 20 you

1256
01:10:27.751 --> 01:10:30.360
know,
they said all these things because like you can't,

1257
01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:35.070
you're not supposed to be in an intoxicated state more than a little bit.

1258
01:10:35.071 --> 01:10:37.440
And if you are,
and then you've got a drug problem,

1259
01:10:37.441 --> 01:10:40.590
I must have a drug problem when it's,
isn't it?

1260
01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.750
Isn't it possible that not all drugs are exactly the same?
You know,

1261
01:10:45.751 --> 01:10:49.260
isn't it possible that you don't put everything under the umbrella of drugs?

1262
01:10:49.261 --> 01:10:49.390
Yeah.
So

1263
01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:52.480
<v 7>what's holding you back?
Do you think it,
the people that are holding it back,</v>

1264
01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:56.050
I've always said no one needs pot more than the guy who wants pot to be illegal

1265
01:10:56.770 --> 01:11:00.040
right now.
No one needs acid more than the guy who wants to make acid delete.

1266
01:11:00.070 --> 01:11:03.610
Sure.
No one needs mush,
you know,
down the line.
It's so simple.

1267
01:11:03.850 --> 01:11:06.700
So how is it still in a situation the way it is in today,

1268
01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:11.680
in 2011 with all the information that we have,
it's still never get stopped.

1269
01:11:11.681 --> 01:11:13.980
And there's a feeling of helplessness.
Well,
you

1270
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.910
<v 6>know,
they have reopened tests into a Mtma and Psilocybin,
uh,</v>

1271
01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:22.200
the Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies.

1272
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:26.130
You can go to their website.
Um,
they're,
they,
they've got federal,

1273
01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.160
they're doing federally approved testing with Mtma for people with posttraumatic

1274
01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.380
stress disorder,
which I think is a great thing.
You know what I mean?

1275
01:11:34.381 --> 01:11:37.560
And I think it's going to be extremely beneficial,
especially Mtma,
you know,

1276
01:11:37.561 --> 01:11:40.030
there's a lot of really positive results with that.
You know,

1277
01:11:40.050 --> 01:11:42.870
I think a silicide me gets a little squirrely,
you know,

1278
01:11:42.930 --> 01:11:46.290
if you've had some horrific experiences abroad,

1279
01:11:46.410 --> 01:11:49.350
I wouldn't recommend silicide been,
if someone asked me was the drug of choice,

1280
01:11:49.351 --> 01:11:49.860
I wouldn't answer.

1281
01:11:49.860 --> 01:11:53.060
So they're not using that to treat post traumatic stress disorder there,

1282
01:11:53.061 --> 01:11:54.900
especially if you might've done something,
you know,

1283
01:11:54.990 --> 01:11:58.410
not really entirely happy about,
you know,
what they're using it for,

1284
01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.520
what terminal illness.
Those are the experiments that they've been doing,
uh,

1285
01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.170
where they,
um,

1286
01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:08.850
give silicide and to people who have late stage cancer and it helps them

1287
01:12:08.851 --> 01:12:12.240
overcome death related anxiety because you take it,

1288
01:12:12.810 --> 01:12:16.470
you take synthetic silicide in which I would love to try,
which is a,

1289
01:12:16.471 --> 01:12:19.530
I'm so much better than apparently regular.
Actually.

1290
01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:23.660
I think that you're supposed to say psilocybin,
but uh,
because it,
um,

1291
01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:26.610
it's easier to dose out.
You know,
when you're eating mushrooms,

1292
01:12:26.611 --> 01:12:28.560
it's not like each mushroom has an exact,

1293
01:12:29.010 --> 01:12:33.120
a certain amount of psilocybin at one of the trip is his name.

1294
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:34.280
I don't know.

1295
01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:39.240
I bet the speculation about a psychedelic trips is that the more people take the

1296
01:12:39.241 --> 01:12:43.780
psychedelic trip,
the more potent the psychedelic is.
So like those,

1297
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:47.620
the thing with ketamine that Mckenna always talked about how ketamine some

1298
01:12:47.630 --> 01:12:49.890
seemed like nobody had been there yet.

1299
01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:52.920
Like you did this psychedelic experience and you got there,
he said,

1300
01:12:52.921 --> 01:12:57.300
describe it as like a giant office building,
but all the cubicles are empty.

1301
01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:01.890
You know what I mean?
Whereas like mushrooms,
right,
my space,
2011.

1302
01:13:02.220 --> 01:13:03.270
Whereas mushrooms,

1303
01:13:03.390 --> 01:13:08.390
it's like you are diving into a giant rich river of human history and it's all

1304
01:13:09.391 --> 01:13:10.224
together,

1305
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:15.410
all in one gigantic fucking soup and you're going to add your trip to this huge

1306
01:13:16.171 --> 01:13:19.980
pool of trips.
So,
you know,
the way they're doing these tests,
you know,
is uh,

1307
01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:24.850
so fucking cool.
And now it's so loved it,
uh,
have this,
uh,

1308
01:13:25.170 --> 01:13:29.430
they have people lay down on a bed and they have sitting on either side of them,

1309
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:30.690
psychotherapists.

1310
01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:35.190
So while you're going into the ecstasy experience or while you're going into the

1311
01:13:35.191 --> 01:13:36.270
mushroom experience,

1312
01:13:36.271 --> 01:13:40.680
you have these people who are there to talk to you so that when you say,
man,

1313
01:13:40.710 --> 01:13:44.730
there's fucking super intelligent toddlers swimming through my body and mocking

1314
01:13:44.731 --> 01:13:49.280
my thoughts,
they could say,
oh,
let's talk about that.
What,
um,
you know,

1315
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:52.140
what do you think those things are when you see them?
Describe them to me.

1316
01:13:52.410 --> 01:13:54.180
Or if you don't want to talk,
they don't.
If you don't,

1317
01:13:54.181 --> 01:13:56.190
if you just want to be by yourself,
they leave you alone.

1318
01:13:56.460 --> 01:13:58.620
But they guide you through the experience.
Like,

1319
01:13:58.621 --> 01:14:01.260
it's kind of like Western shamanism,
but,

1320
01:14:01.261 --> 01:14:05.490
but have they have the experience themselves or are they just sort of a neutered

1321
01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:09.630
bystander?
Um,
you know,
I think if they've had,
have had the experience,

1322
01:14:09.631 --> 01:14:11.970
I don't think that they're going to announce that right.

1323
01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:16.600
Because it's such a strict fucking thing and just the fact that they're letting

1324
01:14:16.601 --> 01:14:20.440
them reopen tests since,
uh,
I believe October six,

1325
01:14:20.441 --> 01:14:25.441
1966 was when Lsd was made completely federally illegal and all testing on

1326
01:14:26.711 --> 01:14:28.450
psychedelics was brought to a halt,

1327
01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:33.340
bringing us into a kind of pharmacological dark age where nobody could fucking,

1328
01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:37.780
uh,
even experiment with the substances that are,
I know what it is.
Meanwhile,

1329
01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:38.210
you know,

1330
01:14:38.210 --> 01:14:41.110
you could get stricken on and pull it out of a plant and no one's ever going to

1331
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:42.400
bat an eye.
Yeah.
Meanwhile,

1332
01:14:42.401 --> 01:14:45.760
you have people getting cat scans and their fucking brain looks like the surface

1333
01:14:45.761 --> 01:14:50.140
of the moon because there've been slurping back shitty club ecstasy and God

1334
01:14:50.141 --> 01:14:51.580
knows what the fuck that is.
You know,

1335
01:14:51.581 --> 01:14:55.240
they haven't been taking like pure pharmaceutical grade chemicals,

1336
01:14:55.241 --> 01:14:56.260
which is what you should own.

1337
01:14:56.290 --> 01:14:58.870
You should only take that when you're taking a hallucinogen.

1338
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.500
<v 7>Do you think that this,
this,
uh,
idea of a trip,</v>

1339
01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:06.010
like when you take mushrooms that you are entering into accumulation of trips

1340
01:15:06.011 --> 01:15:07.780
throughout human history,
does that make sense to you?

1341
01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:12.160
And if that does make sense then is this the silicide than that's chemically

1342
01:15:12.161 --> 01:15:15.700
produced or that's artificially produced?
Does that bring it to the same place?

1343
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:17.020
<v 6>Yeah,
I bet it does.
And I,</v>

1344
01:15:17.021 --> 01:15:21.790
it's just a radio frequency wand tunes you in two different ways may be slightly

1345
01:15:21.791 --> 01:15:25.420
different,
but it's like you're still tuning into the same fucking station.

1346
01:15:25.810 --> 01:15:30.490
And I been also,
you know,
the,
the different tests that they did.

1347
01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.350
Um,
for example,

1348
01:15:32.351 --> 01:15:35.980
the Good Friday experiment at Harvard where they gave Psilocybin to people in

1349
01:15:35.981 --> 01:15:39.400
the basement of a church and pipe down the church music to see if it induced

1350
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:44.790
mystical states and the modern stuff Johns Hopkins is doing with the same exact

1351
01:15:45.670 --> 01:15:49.600
purpose to see if you can create mystical experience.
The effects they're having,

1352
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:53.830
they had from that is like people from the Johns Hopkins experience are

1353
01:15:53.831 --> 01:15:56.260
reporting a year later that their lives are better,

1354
01:15:56.261 --> 01:15:58.000
they're more connected with their family,

1355
01:15:58.560 --> 01:16:03.010
they feel like life is more worth living,
their anxieties decreased.

1356
01:16:03.550 --> 01:16:07.630
There's really positive results from it.
Wow.
A lot of it's probably like,

1357
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:09.880
you know,
when you,
you're in your DNA like yeah,

1358
01:16:09.881 --> 01:16:11.920
I have my grandfather's nose and stuff like that.

1359
01:16:11.921 --> 01:16:14.050
Like the history of your own DNA.

1360
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:18.830
So like maybe mushrooms lets you kind of tap the history of your DNA some way.

1361
01:16:18.831 --> 01:16:19.664
Like a Maybelline.

1362
01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:23.410
<v 7>It's probably,
yeah,
it's probably information,
you know,
I mean,
what,</v>

1363
01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:24.820
when you look at instincts,

1364
01:16:24.821 --> 01:16:28.450
like a lot of instincts are set up just to protect you,
you know,
from,

1365
01:16:28.480 --> 01:16:31.600
from shit that's happened to people in the past and it's become,
you know,

1366
01:16:31.601 --> 01:16:35.080
a part of the human instinct,
like a category,

1367
01:16:35.100 --> 01:16:38.440
the or catalog rather than you have in your mind.
Oh yeah.

1368
01:16:38.460 --> 01:16:41.320
She'll like the reason why people are afraid of monsters.
You know,

1369
01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:44.260
little kids that grow up in cities are scared of monsters.
Well,

1370
01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:48.010
the reason why is because you know you were a monkey's jaguars used to eat

1371
01:16:48.011 --> 01:16:49.870
people.
That's why you're scared to go out at night.

1372
01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:50.950
Why are you scared to go out at night?

1373
01:16:50.951 --> 01:16:54.160
Because the predators were fucking hunting you at night,
man,
you got eaten.

1374
01:16:54.490 --> 01:16:57.280
When they look at like a lot of the early hominid skulls,

1375
01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:02.170
a lot of them show signs of predation by big cats.
That's what we're scared of.

1376
01:17:02.171 --> 01:17:05.050
So that,
that monster,
that flash in a child's mind,

1377
01:17:05.051 --> 01:17:09.470
a big teeth and it's scary beast.
That shit's ingrained in the memory.
There's,

1378
01:17:09.471 --> 01:17:13.970
there's something in there from one monkey a billion years ago or whatever that

1379
01:17:13.971 --> 01:17:15.920
saw another monkey get jacked by a cat,

1380
01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:16.600
<v 6>you know?</v>

1381
01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.800
Well and also that's why dogs are so excited when you come home because like

1382
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:23.590
back when people first started domesticating dogs,

1383
01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:26.190
if you went out on a hunting trip,
I,

1384
01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.270
there's like a good chance you were just going to get killed.

1385
01:17:28.271 --> 01:17:32.900
Like coming home used to be a much bigger deal.
That's why you're,

1386
01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.073
<v 8>you survived.</v>

1387
01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:40.190
<v 6>Cause the dog's still tuned while,
I mean Shit,
if my dog goes outside,</v>

1388
01:17:40.191 --> 01:17:42.380
it's still Mike.
At Eaton.
I'm a little Chihuahua.

1389
01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:42.941
<v 7>You know,</v>

1390
01:17:42.941 --> 01:17:46.810
I think one of the hardest things for us to really wrap our heads around is that

1391
01:17:46.811 --> 01:17:51.811
we are just one frame and this infinite chapter and we're all trying to figure

1392
01:17:52.481 --> 01:17:54.010
it out as it's going along.

1393
01:17:54.011 --> 01:17:57.400
We're all like trying to lowball stop this ride slow down.

1394
01:17:57.550 --> 01:18:00.340
Let me get a map of this.
Let me hold on,
hold on,
hold on.

1395
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:03.150
Who is running the train?
Do we know who's running the trends?

1396
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.440
Can we slow the train down?
Shit.
Shit.

1397
01:18:05.530 --> 01:18:07.690
I hop off the train and watch it from the outside.

1398
01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:10.720
They'll let me stay on a little longer.
Where are we going?
What time is it?

1399
01:18:10.721 --> 01:18:11.800
Does anyone have the time?

1400
01:18:12.170 --> 01:18:17.170
We are all on this wild train ride and it's going to become someone else's train

1401
01:18:17.981 --> 01:18:20.940
ride next life and it's going to keep going.
You don't.

1402
01:18:20.941 --> 01:18:24.190
We were living and dying on this ride for as long as it takes.

1403
01:18:24.650 --> 01:18:26.660
<v 6>Actually the person on the train ride isn't you.</v>

1404
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.190
It's your DNA and that's why it's always trying to get you to fuck is it knows

1405
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:34.400
you're the train.
It's on.
It's going off the tracks because you're going to die.

1406
01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:37.130
It's like you gotta fuck.
You got to make more.
You got to make more.

1407
01:18:37.131 --> 01:18:39.680
I got to get off this thing.
Eventually.
You're not going to last.

1408
01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:43.880
You're not going.
No Way.
Eventually,
yeah,
you're were all warm food,
man.

1409
01:18:43.881 --> 01:18:46.460
There's no question about that.
Don't entertain the idea.

1410
01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:49.640
If you think you're not fucking dirt,

1411
01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:53.120
then you're out of your mind like we're all doomed.
There's no way out of it.

1412
01:18:53.121 --> 01:18:57.320
We're all getting sucked into the future where we used to it.
Your bodies,

1413
01:18:57.321 --> 01:19:00.410
this body that you're rocking right now is not going to last our body.
Yeah,

1414
01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.270
I mean what we really are.
Yeah,
that's right.

1415
01:19:02.410 --> 01:19:06.340
<v 7>Who knows if does that true though?
Everybody says,
yeah,
I know,</v>

1416
01:19:06.341 --> 01:19:09.910
but you don't know.
You don't know any more than you know that it does.
It does.

1417
01:19:10.170 --> 01:19:13.260
It's a fucking giant guessing game.
Well,
you know,

1418
01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:16.240
it's one of the most offensive things about religion is that they pretend that

1419
01:19:16.241 --> 01:19:19.640
they know something that is impossible to fucking know.
Well,

1420
01:19:19.710 --> 01:19:24.610
that's just as just as ridiculous.
When hippies pretend that when they die,

1421
01:19:24.611 --> 01:19:28.660
you will go into this interdimensional love.
You don't know.

1422
01:19:28.770 --> 01:19:32.130
<v 6>Can I,
can I,
can I be,
can I please be the obnoxious hippie?
Sure.</v>

1423
01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.600
Thinking take that,
uh,
uh,
be at the hippies advocate there and say that,

1424
01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:41.910
let me be at peace advocate.
The,
um,
the,
uh,
I,
I think that,

1425
01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:42.840
you know,

1426
01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:47.840
the idea that people maybe have that you retain your personality when your body

1427
01:19:48.661 --> 01:19:53.070
stops existing and you go into some kind of like new age,
um,

1428
01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:53.910
uh,

1429
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:58.090
paradise where you're flying around sipping honey out of the craters of heaven.

1430
01:19:58.091 --> 01:20:01.260
And after you're there for a certain amount of time,
you're like,
you know what?

1431
01:20:01.650 --> 01:20:05.850
I think I want to go back to earth and reincarnate as a kid with down syndrome.

1432
01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.040
I don't think that,
you know what I mean?

1433
01:20:08.041 --> 01:20:12.510
I don't think that that really happens because I don't believe that,
um,
um,

1434
01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.300
so many people on the earth who may be your,

1435
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:19.650
are born like with disabilities are an incredibly difficult situations.

1436
01:20:19.650 --> 01:20:24.360
It's hard for me to imagine someone at a super dimensional spa,
um,

1437
01:20:24.580 --> 01:20:26.160
being like,
yeah,
you know,
I want to,

1438
01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:32.170
I think it's time for me to reincarnate as a blind person who,
um,

1439
01:20:32.460 --> 01:20:36.510
can't walk and to,
um,
yeah,
I know,
you know what I'm saying?

1440
01:20:36.660 --> 01:20:41.090
So that's silly,
but I'm,
and sorry for the two long explanation for that,
but,
um,

1441
01:20:41.490 --> 01:20:46.170
but I think that there is a nother thing that we are,

1442
01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:47.820
no matter what,
which is our consciousness.

1443
01:20:47.821 --> 01:20:50.550
And I think once the body ceases to exist,

1444
01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:55.410
that consciousness continues to radiate inside of everything,

1445
01:20:55.411 --> 01:20:58.280
in through everything.
And that's what we really are.
So

1446
01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.000
<v 7>I'm not necessarily convinced,</v>

1447
01:21:00.390 --> 01:21:04.140
I'm not necessarily convinced that consciousness is not attached completely to

1448
01:21:04.141 --> 01:21:07.880
being a biological entity.
Then you know,

1449
01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:11.370
that one of the things about being a biological entity,

1450
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.730
being some something with some sort of,
uh,
you know,

1451
01:21:14.731 --> 01:21:15.900
you have personal sovereignty,

1452
01:21:15.901 --> 01:21:18.260
you have the ability to control your own movement and destiny.

1453
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:23.220
That's why consciousness like the actual thought of consciousness as an entity,

1454
01:21:23.221 --> 01:21:24.480
that we're,
that's where it comes from.

1455
01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:27.720
It comes from the need to keep this one thing alive.

1456
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:32.190
When you die and you become the next thing.
If there is an x thing,

1457
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:34.410
it's very possible.
There will be no consciousness.

1458
01:21:34.620 --> 01:21:37.890
It's very possible that the idea of consciousness system,
egocentric,

1459
01:21:37.891 --> 01:21:42.891
ridiculous notion that you have to keep the idea of you when you aren't you,

1460
01:21:43.021 --> 01:21:48.000
when you,
you are a drop in a river of information and that's what,

1461
01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:51.610
that's what leaves this life and that there is no consciousness.
That's

1462
01:21:51.650 --> 01:21:55.760
<v 6>that,
that idea that you just said,
this is an idea that uh,</v>

1463
01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:58.820
is the,
uh,
and you know,
I forgive me,

1464
01:21:58.821 --> 01:22:02.120
I mean this an atheist get really mad when you talk about atheism.
Uh,

1465
01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.720
with some atheist can get very sensitive but atheists are just as silly as

1466
01:22:05.721 --> 01:22:08.600
religious.
But atheist have a ghost story.
They really are.
Okay.
Yeah.

1467
01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:12.350
Any organization.
But the atheist goes story so,
so Christians have a ghost story.

1468
01:22:12.380 --> 01:22:15.290
Yeah.
The Christian goes story is how the atheist goes.

1469
01:22:15.291 --> 01:22:18.140
Story is a different Gos story cause an atheist,

1470
01:22:18.290 --> 01:22:21.440
well inevitably tell you no,

1471
01:22:21.441 --> 01:22:24.170
you don't understand that when you die,

1472
01:22:24.620 --> 01:22:26.450
everything stops.

1473
01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:29.840
There's nothing complete nothingness.

1474
01:22:29.930 --> 01:22:33.200
You can't comprehend it because there's no way to comprehend it because it's

1475
01:22:33.201 --> 01:22:36.800
nothing.
And then they stop and they expect you to be like,
oh my God,

1476
01:22:36.801 --> 01:22:40.360
that's terrible.
But if you look at what Socrates said,

1477
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:43.550
which you guys should read because it's fucking hilarious and awesome when uh,

1478
01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:46.910
he made it what's called his apology because they wanted to execute him and make

1479
01:22:46.911 --> 01:22:51.680
him drink hemlock and his response to their attempt to egg or they were going to

1480
01:22:51.681 --> 01:22:54.320
execute him,
he said,
okay,
I tell you what,
here's the deal.

1481
01:22:54.710 --> 01:22:59.710
If you kill me and I die and there's nothing like when I'm in my deepest sleep

1482
01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.450
and the deepest,
deepest sleep and there's just nothing at all,

1483
01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:06.240
then you've given me paradox.
That's paradise because this isn't exactly the,

1484
01:23:06.340 --> 01:23:10.390
a fucking fun park here in early Athens.
And guess what,

1485
01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:14.980
being in complete nonexistence for infinity might be better than not having to

1486
01:23:14.981 --> 01:23:18.080
like sneak around and fuck 14 year olds cause I'm getting too old.

1487
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:19.560
<v 2>The catch him.</v>

1488
01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:30.040
<v 6>I think I gave you catch these 14 year old a Olympian athletes,
but,</v>

1489
01:23:30.041 --> 01:23:34.990
and then the other thing he said to them is,
if there is something after this,

1490
01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:37.020
if I die,
if you give me this stuff in there,

1491
01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:38.890
some other thing and I continue to exist,

1492
01:23:39.130 --> 01:23:42.250
then I'm going to keep doing what I was doing here,

1493
01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:46.840
which was going around and embarrassing everybody with is a motive inquisition

1494
01:23:46.841 --> 01:23:49.660
that essentially makes you realize that you don't know anything.

1495
01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:53.870
<v 7>Well,
have you ever heard the theory that every timeline,
every life is,</v>

1496
01:23:53.871 --> 01:23:56.420
is repeated until you get it right?

1497
01:23:56.660 --> 01:23:59.750
And that what we're dealing with this one timeline of,

1498
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:03.590
of this earth that you are listening to this podcast right now,

1499
01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:08.830
you are a part of an infinite number of timelines that are all interwoven and

1500
01:24:09.681 --> 01:24:14.681
that you go through this one and then you come back until you get it right and

1501
01:24:14.931 --> 01:24:19.931
you keep doing it until you have no shitty thoughts until you have nothing

1502
01:24:20.421 --> 01:24:23.570
wrong.
No personality defect until you literally,
literally,

1503
01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:27.070
ultimately achieve enlightenment.
Oh,
can I add,
can I add something?

1504
01:24:27.080 --> 01:24:30.950
Biggest hippie theory.
Let me,
I mean,
you say it is,
but not evidence.

1505
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:34.670
The evidence states that the universe itself is fractal.
Okay.

1506
01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:38.960
And the latest findings about big bang or about a black holes rather,

1507
01:24:38.961 --> 01:24:43.370
is that inside every black hole that exist,
the possibility of another universe.

1508
01:24:43.610 --> 01:24:48.200
That's the ultimate fractal because we know that inside every is a black hole.

1509
01:24:48.350 --> 01:24:51.530
And if inside every galaxy there's a supermassive black hole,

1510
01:24:51.531 --> 01:24:55.990
that's exactly one half of 1% of the mass,
the galaxy.
And what the theory is,

1511
01:24:55.991 --> 01:25:00.991
is that inside that black hole exists a whole nother universe with hundreds of

1512
01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.800
billions of galaxies,
each with a black hole in the center of them.

1513
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:08.060
Each has hundreds of billions of galaxies inside of it,
and it never ends.

1514
01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:11.210
And it literally is the ultimate fractal.
If that's the case,

1515
01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:15.410
I don't think it's that preposterous that your silly little fucking life can be

1516
01:25:15.411 --> 01:25:17.540
repeated over and over again.
You know?
Oh,

1517
01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:19.910
I'm going to be Bob the post man til I die.
No,
no,
no,
no.

1518
01:25:19.911 --> 01:25:22.310
You're going to be a Bob the post man for infinity.

1519
01:25:22.311 --> 01:25:24.260
You motherfucker until you get it right.

1520
01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:28.370
I don't think that's any more ridiculous than the idea that inside every black

1521
01:25:28.371 --> 01:25:29.690
holes into their fucking universe.

1522
01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.930
I think that's positive part that that's kind of ridiculous and until you're

1523
01:25:32.931 --> 01:25:34.760
positive and you have no negative energy,

1524
01:25:34.761 --> 01:25:37.910
that just sounds like [inaudible] you can live your life without,

1525
01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.690
without fucking it up.
But there's a negative that's positive.

1526
01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:43.970
<v 6>There's a negative version of that idea that you just had and it's from</v>

1527
01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.140
Nietzsche and that his idea is exactly the same thing.

1528
01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.360
It's called infinite return or something.

1529
01:25:50.361 --> 01:25:51.890
The law of infinite or I can't read the name of it,

1530
01:25:51.891 --> 01:25:56.891
but his idea isn't that when you get things right then you get to move on his

1531
01:25:57.561 --> 01:26:02.480
ideas.
No,
you don't get to get things right.
Everything just happens infinitely.

1532
01:26:02.481 --> 01:26:06.290
Exactly way it happened this time.
So the amount of time in your life,

1533
01:26:06.291 --> 01:26:09.770
if you are happy or more than you are sat in your life,
then you are in heaven.

1534
01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:13.880
And if you are in misery more than you're happy,
your life in your own hell,

1535
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.740
and that goes on forever and a day job.

1536
01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:19.870
<v 7>That seems like a giant leap though.
If you,
you can live this life over again.</v>

1537
01:26:19.871 --> 01:26:21.310
You're telling me that somehow or another,

1538
01:26:21.311 --> 01:26:26.080
what kind of super order can have every car stop in the exact same spot.

1539
01:26:26.230 --> 01:26:28.140
Every red light be there when you get there.

1540
01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:32.590
<v 6>Every wind your DVD.
Yeah.
Okay,
so life is just a movie.
Sure.</v>

1541
01:26:32.650 --> 01:26:35.890
Everything that's ever been done in your life is predetermined.

1542
01:26:35.891 --> 01:26:39.340
Maybe there's this,
these are all thought experiments.
By the way.

1543
01:26:39.341 --> 01:26:42.000
I Nietzsche was using it more as a true experiment then I,

1544
01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:45.930
<v 7>all I'm saying is that it just requires this giant leap to think that</v>

1545
01:26:45.931 --> 01:26:47.650
everything's going to fall into place.
Exactly.

1546
01:26:47.910 --> 01:26:50.520
<v 6>Well,
it all goes back to the idea that you are,</v>

1547
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:54.660
you are the only person that you can prove has self awareness.
Right?

1548
01:26:54.661 --> 01:26:56.280
You don't know that eyes have self awareness.

1549
01:26:56.281 --> 01:26:59.830
You don't know that Brian has self awareness.
You can't you.
Yeah.

1550
01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:03.010
So that's the idea.
So you can't prove any anybody.

1551
01:27:03.090 --> 01:27:04.830
There's anyone else except you.
Right?

1552
01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:07.650
You like to think that we all have self awareness.

1553
01:27:07.651 --> 01:27:10.320
You like to think that we're not projections of you,
but it's,

1554
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:14.670
it's possible that you're the universe in the very first phase of it's waking up

1555
01:27:14.671 --> 01:27:15.151
and as it's,

1556
01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:19.620
and it's having this nervous breakdown where it projects this bizarre reality

1557
01:27:19.621 --> 01:27:23.940
where you're like hosting a podcast and you host the UFC and you,
um,

1558
01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:27.790
you are,
uh,
you used to host fear factor.
I mean,

1559
01:27:27.791 --> 01:27:30.840
it doesn't at all seem kind of absurd,
like a ridiculous,
weird dream.

1560
01:27:30.841 --> 01:27:33.690
Do you really think it's happening?
Well,
that's the idea.
If you,

1561
01:27:33.691 --> 01:27:37.350
if everyone can individually do that same thing to them and look at your life

1562
01:27:37.351 --> 01:27:40.950
and really think of all the coincidences and synchronicities that have happened

1563
01:27:40.951 --> 01:27:42.270
in your life and all the,

1564
01:27:42.450 --> 01:27:46.170
all the bizarre events that maybe have even just happened today,

1565
01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:49.230
you really think that that's all an accident.

1566
01:27:49.231 --> 01:27:53.220
You really think that this whole thing hasn't been planned out just for you

1567
01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.530
anyway.
It's a narcissistic idea.
Yeah.

1568
01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:57.590
<v 7>But it is a narcissistic idea and really,</v>

1569
01:27:57.591 --> 01:28:00.950
ultimately it's just one of a million different possibilities.
Sure,
sure.

1570
01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:03.050
And so to commit to any one of them.

1571
01:28:03.140 --> 01:28:06.290
It's just like the idea of you saying the atheist.
I feel like this is it,
man.

1572
01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.750
When it's over,
it's just darkness and emptiness.

1573
01:28:08.970 --> 01:28:11.010
<v 9>Woo.
Whoa.</v>

1574
01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:11.551
<v 6>The other,</v>

1575
01:28:11.551 --> 01:28:14.550
the other atheist Boogie man is the guy who shoots people at the abortion
clinic.

1576
01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.630
That's the other one.
Oh yeah.
That guy,
no shit.

1577
01:28:18.750 --> 01:28:19.930
<v 7>Terrified of that guy.
But meanwhile,</v>

1578
01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.940
they're not terrified of a vacuum cleaner sucking babies out of pussy all day to

1579
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:28.970
shooting babies into the great beyond out of a vacuum cleaner.

1580
01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:33.810
<v 6>Yeah.
That specific spot every day.
Yeah.
That's your job.
What?</v>

1581
01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:37.820
That's a sad job.
Who the fuck is a sad,
you know,
when I was growing up,

1582
01:28:37.821 --> 01:28:41.390
I heard bill Cosby for the first time and I was like,
man,

1583
01:28:41.391 --> 01:28:42.920
comedy is fucking incredible.

1584
01:28:42.921 --> 01:28:46.430
This guy just made it where I can't breathe for like the entire album.

1585
01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:49.750
Is there somebody who's like,
mom comes out when she's lying.

1586
01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:52.140
<v 9>Good.
Are you portion when Ri Larry?
Yeah,</v>

1587
01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:53.043
<v 6>and he's like,
oh,</v>

1588
01:28:53.500 --> 01:28:57.990
one day I'll give a borsch sons who dreams of being an abortionist.
Okay.

1589
01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:00.740
<v 7>Yeah.
That's something you sort of stumble on,
you know,</v>

1590
01:29:00.990 --> 01:29:02.340
fuck this check Craig's list.

1591
01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.910
<v 1>No,
if you get her pregnant,
you go,
how did we do this?</v>

1592
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.510
You get a medical textbook and I go screen for it.

1593
01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.990
So this is never happening again.
Learn how to kill baby.

1594
01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:17.050
<v 6>The top shitty jobs,
man.
I mean that's not a satisfying job.</v>

1595
01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.480
Like if you're someone who delivers babies,
you come home,
you're like,

1596
01:29:19.481 --> 01:29:22.150
I delivered three babies today.
Life is beautiful.

1597
01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.370
What do you do when you come home with an abortion doctor?

1598
01:29:24.371 --> 01:29:29.290
So I got no fucking sucked out 30 fetuses today.
I said,
hey babies,

1599
01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:31.690
unless you,
you're already some kind of psycho like that,

1600
01:29:31.691 --> 01:29:35.470
you know you're one step away from killing people.
So your abortion doctor,

1601
01:29:35.610 --> 01:29:39.030
<v 1>oof God.
Well you know what man,
that takes every kind of people.</v>

1602
01:29:39.031 --> 01:29:41.590
I'm sure there's been one of those out there and you know,
if you,

1603
01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.050
if you can speculate it,

1604
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:46.860
the millions and millions of humans on this and this and this in this country

1605
01:29:46.861 --> 01:29:47.480
alone.

1606
01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.660
<v 6>Like what if you went to your abortion doctor and he had a dart board or the</v>

1607
01:29:50.661 --> 01:29:51.500
fetus on it?

1608
01:29:53.270 --> 01:29:56.780
Or if it's favorite TV show is Dexter's estates fetuses,

1609
01:29:57.650 --> 01:30:00.260
they're terrible.
I just hate those fucking takes.
They freak me out.

1610
01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.330
It wore with fetuses.

1611
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:07.790
He's like a fetus that grew out of control.

1612
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:10.820
He turned into a human and just started killing fetuses.

1613
01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.360
<v 1>Do you ever toy with the idea that you know mean you said that everything,</v>

1614
01:30:15.540 --> 01:30:15.820
you know,

1615
01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:20.820
there's this possibility that everything exists by plan and that the same life

1616
01:30:20.911 --> 01:30:22.800
will repeat itself over and over and over again.

1617
01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.850
Do you ever toy with the idea of the human being as as the,

1618
01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.410
as the Caterpillar that will become the butterfly and that you know,

1619
01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.650
our whole society,

1620
01:30:31.651 --> 01:30:36.590
that the massive accelerating pace is moving us towards this event?
Yeah,

1621
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:41.180
<v 6>man,
that's the,
to me,
yes.
That's the idea that I adhere to the most.</v>

1622
01:30:41.181 --> 01:30:45.080
It's like I don't know what it is,
and of course we can't know what it is,

1623
01:30:45.081 --> 01:30:47.750
but just from looking at the weather,

1624
01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:51.710
you know it's gonna rain and you can look at what's happening now and every time

1625
01:30:51.711 --> 01:30:56.711
I sit down in front of my fucking Imac and and basking in the glow of world of

1626
01:30:58.191 --> 01:31:01.670
Warcraft is I eat edible marijuana.

1627
01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:07.070
I considered myself it's only going to be about 20 more years that you're

1628
01:31:07.071 --> 01:31:08.180
outside the machine.

1629
01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:13.190
They're neurologically gonna figure out how to put you into this place where you

1630
01:31:13.191 --> 01:31:15.350
can experience weightlessness,

1631
01:31:15.351 --> 01:31:19.880
where the weight of the body's lifted and you can live in a virtual paradise for

1632
01:31:19.881 --> 01:31:21.080
the last part of your life.

1633
01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:24.680
That's something we all have to look forward to is making the decision.
I mean,

1634
01:31:24.681 --> 01:31:27.500
depending on how old you are right now or how healthy you are,

1635
01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:31.310
you will eventually have to make the decision between spending.

1636
01:31:31.311 --> 01:31:35.720
Most of your time in this world are spending most of your time in a virtual

1637
01:31:35.721 --> 01:31:36.760
universe.
A,

1638
01:31:36.761 --> 01:31:41.450
a virtual paradise that is indistinguishable are probably only the

1639
01:31:41.451 --> 01:31:43.970
distinguishment is that it's a million times better than here.

1640
01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:48.710
And then somebody will hack it because it's made by Sony inside your head.
Yeah,

1641
01:31:48.711 --> 01:31:51.530
sure.
Fucked.
Oh No.
All that.
Yeah.
Yeah,
sure.
There's gonna be,

1642
01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:53.210
there's gonna be some problems initially,

1643
01:31:53.211 --> 01:31:55.620
but isn't that crazy about that Sony Shit?
I mean,
yeah.

1644
01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.340
What exactly did happen first?
Like their,

1645
01:31:58.341 --> 01:32:00.190
their network just went down for a couple of days

1646
01:32:00.190 --> 01:32:00.580
<v 1>and,
right.</v>

1647
01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:05.560
But they didn't say anything and supposedly a hacker got in and they don't know

1648
01:32:05.561 --> 01:32:09.550
what they got.
Like they don't know if they got their names and credit cards,

1649
01:32:09.551 --> 01:32:13.150
but they,
there people are thinking,
I got like credit card numbers.

1650
01:32:14.230 --> 01:32:17.810
That's like millions of people's cards.
Are they?

1651
01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:22.140
I told you I got jacked.
Yeah,
they stole my credit card.
I started that.

1652
01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:24.040
I get phone calls from American Express.

1653
01:32:24.220 --> 01:32:27.530
Are you buying $500 worth of Godiva chocolate?

1654
01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:33.280
I guess they probably bought a bunch of gift cards.
Gift cards.
Yeah.
And you can,

1655
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:37.270
you know,
did you go to Norman in Nordstrom's and you know,

1656
01:32:37.271 --> 01:32:41.560
spend $2,000 in Neiman Marcus?
Did they just went off these fucking people?
Yeah.

1657
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:43.450
That sucks man.
Yeah,

1658
01:32:43.510 --> 01:32:47.020
it's creepy and it's weird to know that this is weird little electronic

1659
01:32:47.021 --> 01:32:49.840
parasites that click,
click,
click,
they get the number and then,
you know,

1660
01:32:49.841 --> 01:32:51.980
they make a new card and they just sucking number

1661
01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:56.660
<v 6>present website just got infiltrated by [inaudible] and they went into the html.</v>

1662
01:32:56.661 --> 01:32:59.090
I still have to fix it.
If you go to my website now,
there's nothing there.

1663
01:32:59.091 --> 01:33:02.460
I didn't take it down,
but um,
they went into the,

1664
01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:05.510
they injected into the html of my,
uh,

1665
01:33:05.690 --> 01:33:08.360
index page and say any place there was html,

1666
01:33:08.570 --> 01:33:13.490
some kind of fucking I frame that took people to a website in Russia or

1667
01:33:13.491 --> 01:33:17.180
something.
So when you went to my website,
a Google alert would pop up and say,

1668
01:33:17.181 --> 01:33:20.450
this side is known for hosting malware.
Wow.

1669
01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:23.780
And I did go in and like erase everything,
but they got my password,

1670
01:33:24.170 --> 01:33:25.670
which is totally weird,
man.
It's like,

1671
01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:28.710
I don't know how they figured out my fucking password.
It's like,

1672
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:29.880
I love documentaries

1673
01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:31.420
<v 1>on hackers.</v>

1674
01:33:31.421 --> 01:33:35.920
There's this documentary they did about this one area of Soviet bloc,

1675
01:33:36.310 --> 01:33:40.300
Eastern Europe.
I forget what exact country it is,
but one,

1676
01:33:40.301 --> 01:33:44.560
one Soviet country,
one former Soviet country,
and they're all hackers,

1677
01:33:44.561 --> 01:33:47.530
like the whole country fill the backers like they went through this city,

1678
01:33:47.531 --> 01:33:50.370
like everyone's got a Mercedes.
They just fucking everybody,

1679
01:33:50.371 --> 01:33:54.610
they just figured these young guys of like figured out a way to fuck the system

1680
01:33:54.611 --> 01:33:55.840
and steal all this money.

1681
01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:59.700
<v 6>Yeah,
that's what,
that's what,
that's what that happened.
It sucks.</v>

1682
01:34:00.300 --> 01:34:04.110
What is that?
How do they do that?
I have no idea.
That'd be fixed.
It's a Bot.

1683
01:34:04.290 --> 01:34:09.120
It's a Bot makes down with it.
Obviously a shitty password or maybe they,
um,

1684
01:34:09.150 --> 01:34:13.430
I got my fucking a world of Warcraft account act a while ago.
Really?

1685
01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:16.830
I'll often do you play that fucking matter?
I love it.

1686
01:34:17.250 --> 01:34:21.360
My gas rack is a warlock and he's almost level 71

1687
01:34:21.710 --> 01:34:25.690
<v 1>feel about the guys who buy and and sell their,
their characters.</v>

1688
01:34:25.720 --> 01:34:29.320
When you think about that,
is that cheating?
Buying a character?
Yeah.

1689
01:34:29.321 --> 01:34:33.250
Like if you can't,
you like build up some sort of characters.
Mine gold.
Yeah.

1690
01:34:33.310 --> 01:34:35.180
Can't you do something like that where you get your characters?

1691
01:34:36.140 --> 01:34:37.100
<v 6>Yeah,
you can do that,</v>

1692
01:34:37.101 --> 01:34:40.190
but you're going to miss the friendship and companionship of your guilt.

1693
01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.280
Don't you want to,
there's lifelong friendships we formed.

1694
01:34:44.310 --> 01:34:46.240
You have buddies and your guilt breaks.

1695
01:34:46.350 --> 01:34:49.880
Wrote a Warcraft is like every couple of months he'll break it just so you won't

1696
01:34:49.881 --> 01:34:51.950
play it.
No,
I don't break it.
That doesn't work anymore.

1697
01:34:51.951 --> 01:34:55.760
Blizzard fix that now you can like it's there no matter what.
Like yeah,

1698
01:34:55.761 --> 01:34:57.290
he's an online is.
Yeah,

1699
01:34:57.291 --> 01:35:01.430
cause I get obsessive with video games so when I get addicted what I do is I

1700
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:03.530
just delete,
destroyed the property,

1701
01:35:03.531 --> 01:35:06.620
make it so that I can't play it anymore so that it hurts.

1702
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:11.060
There's a roadblock in between me having to download it and then inevitably like

1703
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:15.640
I'll download it again and play.
It's a cycle of addiction.
Him that in starcraft,

1704
01:35:15.650 --> 01:35:18.500
you're on both of them now.
Do you have to have it inside your computer?

1705
01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:21.760
Do you have to have a CD in there to play it or does it an online store you

1706
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:24.200
download the beautiful,
beautiful thing you don't need to,

1707
01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:27.080
but you have to have it on your computer.
Cause like quake live,

1708
01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.980
you download like a client app.
Yeah.
But it's all online now.

1709
01:35:31.190 --> 01:35:36.050
Well I don't know how much of it's online is just like,
it's like eight gigs.

1710
01:35:36.051 --> 01:35:37.820
Yeah.
But that whatever's,
there's a,

1711
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:40.040
obviously there's obvious other servers that are,

1712
01:35:40.120 --> 01:35:42.560
but what do you get to do that so cool that you're on it every day.

1713
01:35:42.561 --> 01:35:45.710
Do you get to shoot people or what do you do?
Kids make believe?

1714
01:35:45.770 --> 01:35:48.470
I wish that town wasn't in your voice when you're asked that question.

1715
01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:53.380
Are All different?
I have no,
it's a,
it's a up my video game.
Murders,
tendencies.

1716
01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:57.770
Listen,
it's embarrassing and uh,
it's,
it's childish.

1717
01:35:58.070 --> 01:36:02.030
I'll totally admit that and,
but it's fucking awesome.

1718
01:36:02.090 --> 01:36:04.100
Like they figured out a way,
cause you know,

1719
01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:07.880
we've got the human beings are based on a reward system.

1720
01:36:07.970 --> 01:36:10.970
You do something good and you get our award and that makes you feel good.

1721
01:36:10.971 --> 01:36:14.840
You go jogging the endorphins kick in.
Whenever you accomplish a task,

1722
01:36:14.841 --> 01:36:15.674
you feel good.

1723
01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:20.800
So the people at Blizzard and the CIA join forces and they figured out how to

1724
01:36:21.681 --> 01:36:23.600
neurologically,
uh,

1725
01:36:23.780 --> 01:36:28.780
replicate that sort of endorphin rush and it kind of ever accelerating pace.

1726
01:36:29.691 --> 01:36:32.810
So the game,
the higher level you get,

1727
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:38.070
the more the game begins to complexify and the terrain that you are used to that

1728
01:36:38.181 --> 01:36:39.290
you already thought was cool,

1729
01:36:39.291 --> 01:36:43.340
all of a sudden becomes a million times cooler and then a million times cooler

1730
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:47.290
and then a million times cooler so that you get hooked.
Like,
uh,
like pat,

1731
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:51.410
it's like a Pavlovian fucking response.
You just have an online girlfriend,

1732
01:36:51.411 --> 01:36:55.910
don't you?
Do you really?
I love her.
I wouldn't call her girlfriend.

1733
01:36:58.130 --> 01:37:01.940
What's the odds are that might be a dude.
Um,
it's,

1734
01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:06.560
we are who we decide we are.
Joe Doesn't matter.
Right?
Yeah.
Well,
I mean,
that's,

1735
01:37:06.810 --> 01:37:10.700
here's,
I mean,
that's a funny idea.
Would you be willing to exchange,
uh,

1736
01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:14.180
pretend love messages to a guy playing a woman?

1737
01:37:16.070 --> 01:37:19.040
No,
but let me ask you this.
If,
if let's say,

1738
01:37:19.050 --> 01:37:23.870
let's say you thought about that for a while.
Let's say,
let's say they call,

1739
01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:27.080
let's say in the five,
let's say,
no,
of course not.

1740
01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:30.260
But let's say in the future I was rubbing his dick,
but in the future,

1741
01:37:30.350 --> 01:37:32.450
let's imagine that this thing I,

1742
01:37:32.451 --> 01:37:36.020
we were talking about a neurologically projected universe exists.

1743
01:37:36.560 --> 01:37:41.210
People are going to have to deal with super hot girls coming up to them that

1744
01:37:41.211 --> 01:37:45.640
are,
you know,
really quite beautiful and you're going to know this prize.

1745
01:37:45.890 --> 01:37:49.550
There's chances that guy on earth and the real world.

1746
01:37:49.900 --> 01:37:54.620
So at that point,
what do you do?
Well,
it's just a personality.

1747
01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:56.130
It's a mind.
The machine.
I've,
I've

1748
01:37:56.160 --> 01:37:59.550
<v 7>dated a lot of girls that had a dude's mind,
you know,</v>

1749
01:37:59.730 --> 01:38:02.790
might as well have been a dude.
I mean it wasn't,
but it might as well.
Do you ever

1750
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:05.870
<v 5>did,
the girl wants to yell at you all the time and argue with you.
Hello?</v>

1751
01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:09.620
You are dude,
it's going on here.
Why are you acting all dude like and aggressive?

1752
01:38:09.770 --> 01:38:14.570
Why do you have a dip in your mouth but you and grow dips scared that it

1753
01:38:16.490 --> 01:38:19.640
now I know that's a big fucking deal breaker right there.

1754
01:38:19.641 --> 01:38:22.760
I've got buddies a dip and it never bothers me.
You know spitting in a cup.

1755
01:38:22.761 --> 01:38:25.790
It's kind of gross or whatever but when I was dating a chick and she started

1756
01:38:25.791 --> 01:38:30.110
doing like the fuck off me,
you crazy bitch.
What's next?

1757
01:38:30.111 --> 01:38:33.560
You want to peg a motherfucker?
Oh you want to get your paying on

1758
01:38:35.150 --> 01:38:38.270
<v 7>for those that don't know him Peng is when a girl puts on a dildo and strapped</v>

1759
01:38:38.271 --> 01:38:42.470
it on sticks in your but apparently it happens so often.
If there's a name for it

1760
01:38:43.340 --> 01:38:47.040
<v 5>want to fucking weird world.
We live in man.
Weird world.</v>

1761
01:38:47.510 --> 01:38:50.460
He at least show some have been Londons did we shot him?

1762
01:38:50.461 --> 01:38:54.180
God expre this cycle fucking cheering at the white or the one on the White House

1763
01:38:54.181 --> 01:38:59.181
lawn and they're fucking dancing and singing non non non a

1764
01:39:01.620 --> 01:39:06.410
lot and they were cheering.
You think we should all be like no.
All right.

1765
01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.350
He's dead right.
You just calm down.
He was dead in 1992.

1766
01:39:10.351 --> 01:39:11.880
I've got the documents right here,

1767
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:16.780
1992 that it's a black ops dude.
I really love that.

1768
01:39:16.810 --> 01:39:21.360
That that is a hilarious narrative that Alex Jones is talking about because the

1769
01:39:21.361 --> 01:39:26.361
implication is that there's somewhere in the CIA where there's like a frozen Ben

1770
01:39:26.370 --> 01:39:28.370
Ladin Ice Cube and they're just awaiting the Melton.

1771
01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.490
<v 7>Wasn't that the premise of a movie?</v>

1772
01:39:30.850 --> 01:39:34.450
Wasn't there a guy who did that who killed people and frozen and then dropped

1773
01:39:34.451 --> 01:39:38.290
the bodies off and,
oh,
I think it was the iceman.
That's who it was.

1774
01:39:38.291 --> 01:39:41.190
It wasn't a premise of a movie.
It was that guy that,
uh,

1775
01:39:41.191 --> 01:39:45.670
that crazy a hit man for the mom called the iceman,
the iceman chronicles on Hbo.

1776
01:39:45.850 --> 01:39:47.140
Which of you haven't seen as,

1777
01:39:47.141 --> 01:39:50.470
they are fucking terrifying to know that this guy existed.

1778
01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:53.380
He was a crazy fuck.
You know,

1779
01:39:53.381 --> 01:39:57.670
that guy used to play pool and he used to gamble.
Not with people that I know,

1780
01:39:57.671 --> 01:40:00.970
but that with people that I know who know that people and he,

1781
01:40:00.971 --> 01:40:03.670
as long as you didn't make a fool out of him,
he would lose some money.

1782
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:04.750
He liked to gamble,

1783
01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.810
so you'd go in and play some pool as long as you didn't rob him and make a fool

1784
01:40:07.811 --> 01:40:10.600
out of him,
you know,
as long as it was a competitive game.

1785
01:40:10.990 --> 01:40:13.780
But I guess he got in some sort of an argument with one guy.

1786
01:40:13.781 --> 01:40:18.730
One of the first guys you ever killed was over a pool game.
Uh,
he used to,

1787
01:40:18.731 --> 01:40:22.170
um,
and he apparently had one situation with one guy.

1788
01:40:22.290 --> 01:40:24.490
It felt like the guy was robbing him.
The Guy fucking disappeared.

1789
01:40:24.730 --> 01:40:28.510
Nobody ever saw him again.
He killed so many people,
man,
he killed people over.

1790
01:40:28.511 --> 01:40:30.700
Just a guy would step on his toe.
He would kill him.

1791
01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.520
He would shoot arsenic in his drink and the guy would never know what hit them.

1792
01:40:33.700 --> 01:40:38.440
<v 5>Yeah.
This any in his eye.
He's got that weird accent.
Yeah.
He said,
I had,</v>

1793
01:40:38.441 --> 01:40:41.500
what can you do?
Can you do his voice?
It's really,
oh,
I'd have to listen to it.

1794
01:40:42.040 --> 01:40:45.640
I can only do accents when I hear them.
Yeah.
He's a strange guy,
but it's,

1795
01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:49.870
he stepped on my foot at the theater,
so I just followed him out to his car.

1796
01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.710
I hope they release this on that def photos though cause they're there.

1797
01:40:53.711 --> 01:40:56.280
They haven't decided yet.
Yeah.
Why would they want it ready?

1798
01:40:57.090 --> 01:41:00.520
We still got frost on them.
Well I guess a lot of this senators,

1799
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:09.400
he looks like frosty the snowman either 2002 was reported.

1800
01:41:09.401 --> 01:41:11.920
He was going through dialysis.

1801
01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:16.270
We've got the papers right here.
Yeah,
I don't know man.

1802
01:41:16.271 --> 01:41:19.540
I used to have that bit about Osama bin Laden being a character in the Batman

1803
01:41:19.541 --> 01:41:23.590
moving.
Yeah.
Just think about this.
He used to work for the good guys,

1804
01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:27.370
but Denny switched forces and join the dark side.

1805
01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.780
He's a billionaire who hates us.
Right?

1806
01:41:31.810 --> 01:41:36.810
He lives underground and we almost capture him and every time they get them he

1807
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:40.990
slips away and leaves behind a threatening tape.
I'm like,

1808
01:41:40.991 --> 01:41:44.560
this is an episode of fuck it.
Scooby Doo.
I mean this is ridiculous.

1809
01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:45.341
And the video,

1810
01:41:45.341 --> 01:41:49.820
despite how good video cameras were all over the world was always shit.
Yeah.

1811
01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.320
It was always like one of those first generation cell phone videos when you can

1812
01:41:53.321 --> 01:41:56.110
only take like 30 seconds of video.
You remember those?

1813
01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:58.750
Remember that's what the videos have been bin to always look like.

1814
01:41:58.751 --> 01:42:02.320
It's always like blurry fucking weird.
He's probably been dead forever,
man.

1815
01:42:02.470 --> 01:42:07.180
There was that one fake video that was 100% fake where they,
uh,
they had,

1816
01:42:07.181 --> 01:42:09.490
uh,
a couple of photos of them in a video of him,

1817
01:42:09.491 --> 01:42:11.530
but his face was fat or you're living in a different guy,

1818
01:42:11.531 --> 01:42:12.400
like a totally different guy.

1819
01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.970
Like they put like they put transparencies of the two of them over each other,

1820
01:42:16.270 --> 01:42:19.120
but you know,
as they get more sophisticated,
they just stopped releasing videos.

1821
01:42:19.121 --> 01:42:21.650
That way she doesn't have to make videos and just have him stop making video.

1822
01:42:21.651 --> 01:42:24.310
Sure.
Yeah.
That's the fucking fake bin.
Ladin sucks.

1823
01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:29.230
The guy didn't lose enough weight.
Yeah.
So I don't know.
I don't buy it.

1824
01:42:29.350 --> 01:42:32.680
It's just they lie about so much shit.
If you don't think they'd killed Bin Lot,

1825
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:35.530
she's dead as fuck.
But I think he's probably dead a long time ago.

1826
01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:38.810
I just don't think it just happened.
I mean,
it made,
it might've,
you know,
I mean,

1827
01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:42.700
look,
they said seal team six killed them.
And if that is the case,
you know,

1828
01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.410
those guys aren't going to keep their mouth shut.

1829
01:42:44.411 --> 01:42:46.990
They're not going to pretend that they killed somebody.
And I not,

1830
01:42:46.991 --> 01:42:49.060
I mean it sounds like,
I don't think they would take us.
I mean,

1831
01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:52.240
even when you're dealing with like seals,
there's like a certain,
there's a,

1832
01:42:52.241 --> 01:42:55.720
there's a code that those guys live by and I don't necessarily think they would

1833
01:42:55.721 --> 01:42:57.010
pretend that they killed somebody.

1834
01:42:57.030 --> 01:43:00.970
Like they're supposedly like the baddest motherfuckers in the seals,

1835
01:43:01.390 --> 01:43:05.290
the scariest ones that they send into terrible hostile areas to kill bad guys.

1836
01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:06.010
You know,

1837
01:43:06.010 --> 01:43:09.640
those are the ones that like your reads like some of those books to Dick

1838
01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.360
Marchenko.
I think that's his name,
the rogue warrior crate fucking books,

1839
01:43:13.570 --> 01:43:17.380
all the nutty shit that he did.
Like all throughout the years as a,

1840
01:43:17.381 --> 01:43:21.100
as a head of a,
one of those seal team,
six units were there.

1841
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:25.240
They all would like have long hair and tattoos and they would look,
look weird.

1842
01:43:25.241 --> 01:43:27.550
It was like a fucking Goddamn Sylvester Stallone movie.

1843
01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:31.690
It's like the expendables,
but it was real,
you know?
And,
uh,
yeah,

1844
01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:33.910
there's a lot of guys like that man,
fuck,
that's what they do.

1845
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:35.920
That's what they do.
I mean,
if you watch those,

1846
01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:39.520
you ever watch any of those discovery channels specials on how they,
uh,

1847
01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:43.340
like recruit people and you know what,
you have to go through hell week,
you know,

1848
01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.440
and you have to go through.
We were not to be a navy seal.
Like,
dude,

1849
01:43:47.890 --> 01:43:52.730
the people that get through that or some extraordinary fuckers,
those are,

1850
01:43:52.731 --> 01:43:55.130
those are people who would do some crazy shit.
Yeah.

1851
01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:59.960
This is a lot of people out there that love and live for the idea of getting a

1852
01:43:59.961 --> 01:44:04.490
fucking flat out straight licensed to be a bad mother fucker killing machine.

1853
01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:06.140
And if you want to,

1854
01:44:06.290 --> 01:44:09.710
if you're good enough at killing people and you're willing to pledge your

1855
01:44:09.711 --> 01:44:12.680
loyalty to the United States government,
they'll take in,

1856
01:44:12.860 --> 01:44:14.240
they'll take you in and they'll train you.

1857
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:17.470
They'll fucking give you a great attitude.
A lot of psychological,
you know,

1858
01:44:17.610 --> 01:44:22.220
counseling that they'd been working on for decades and got it down to a science.

1859
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.870
They know exactly how to tune your mind.

1860
01:44:23.871 --> 01:44:27.860
So they could send you places to go fuck people up.
2011 baby.

1861
01:44:31.510 --> 01:44:35.270
So there's a guy right now from c seal team six.
Yeah,

1862
01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:38.090
well there's a whole bunch of them,
but there's one specific,

1863
01:44:38.091 --> 01:44:42.620
I was like Kilbane lawn yesterday.
I'd like a cup of,
uh,

1864
01:44:42.650 --> 01:44:46.730
I'll take a diet coke and shakes.
I don't think he drinks diet coke.

1865
01:44:46.731 --> 01:44:49.730
He's probably drinking whiskey out of a bottle and they're singing.
Yeah,

1866
01:44:49.731 --> 01:44:53.360
they've probably been singing since the moment app on the APP and Bandannas over

1867
01:44:53.361 --> 01:44:55.760
bullet wounds.
I'll get his perch.
So blurred or boss

1868
01:44:57.440 --> 01:45:01.190
fucking animal.
It's fun to think about.
It's fun to think about it being real,

1869
01:45:01.191 --> 01:45:01.940
but I'm,
I,

1870
01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:06.940
it does seem to me I'm a little suspicious that 2:00 AM they dumped his body off

1871
01:45:07.731 --> 01:45:12.200
the side of an aircraft carrier.
The seal team six is the seals of the seals.

1872
01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:15.320
That's what it is.
Seal seal team six.
Uh,

1873
01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.890
it was labeled team six at the time to confuse Soviet intelligence about the

1874
01:45:18.891 --> 01:45:22.640
number of seal teams in operation.
At the time,
there were only two others,

1875
01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:27.440
but the top team six poached the top operatives from all the other seal units

1876
01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:32.360
and train them even more intensely.
So even among proven seals,

1877
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:35.930
the attrition rate for s for team six is half.

1878
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:40.430
So half of the bad motherfuckers that become seals,

1879
01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:44.540
the only half of them can survive to be team six.
Oh yeah.

1880
01:45:44.541 --> 01:45:47.000
And they sent these psychos over there to kill him.
Wow.
Maybe.

1881
01:45:47.090 --> 01:45:49.880
Maybe they did or maybe he's been dead forever.
Who knows?
You know,

1882
01:45:49.881 --> 01:45:53.750
who the fuck knows?
It's,
once you hear that Jessica Lynch story,
you go,
okay,

1883
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:54.920
it's all bets are off.

1884
01:45:54.921 --> 01:45:56.990
They're not doing anything different now than they were back then.

1885
01:45:56.991 --> 01:45:58.550
They were just making shit up back then.

1886
01:45:58.551 --> 01:46:01.010
When you said there was a firefight to rescue,
you know,

1887
01:46:01.011 --> 01:46:02.630
a private Chesca Lynch and you know,

1888
01:46:02.631 --> 01:46:05.840
she was this poor little girl from wherever the fuck she was in Nebraska or

1889
01:46:05.841 --> 01:46:09.050
Kansas or some shit,
you know?
And then she came out and she was like,
listen,

1890
01:46:09.051 --> 01:46:12.540
nobody rescued me.
I was in a hospital.
There was no gun fight.
You know,

1891
01:46:12.570 --> 01:46:14.960
I want to just step away from all this.
Thank you very much.

1892
01:46:14.961 --> 01:46:18.410
And then she got death threats and you fucking trade.
Or you know,

1893
01:46:18.411 --> 01:46:21.530
she had a Hyde and fucking scary shit,
man.

1894
01:46:21.531 --> 01:46:24.020
The government doesn't tell the truth if they're telling us that this happened.

1895
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:27.480
This is not what happened.
Something else happened.
It's a wait,
wait,
wait.

1896
01:46:27.650 --> 01:46:32.650
Maybe you don't believe our great President Obama was sitting in a situation

1897
01:46:32.721 --> 01:46:37.220
room and being shown the plans to descend on this base.
Osama bin Laden.

1898
01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:41.000
You don't believe that that was happening.
Looks good.
Seal team six.
Cool.

1899
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:45.020
I'm going to declare code red.
Some had been like,
yeah,
this is a movie,
Bro.

1900
01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:47.540
This is going to be in a movie,
right?
Yeah.
Listen,

1901
01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:50.430
Nicholas cage will be any must wait to do this before,

1902
01:46:50.630 --> 01:46:52.470
at until after the royal wedding.

1903
01:46:52.500 --> 01:46:56.790
I say the cast Nicolas Cage as the hardened veteran who doesn't give a fuck.

1904
01:46:56.791 --> 01:46:59.990
And he goes over there because if you're going to do a job right,
got it.

1905
01:46:59.991 --> 01:47:02.520
Do it yourself.
It was Hitler's death day.

1906
01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:06.750
Remember that movie that he was in with the plane was that movie?
Oh yeah,

1907
01:47:06.751 --> 01:47:09.870
it's always on reruns for some reason.
I know exactly.
Get con air is

1908
01:47:11.550 --> 01:47:15.120
where all the cons got on.
The plane escaped.
That's the movie,
Bro.

1909
01:47:15.121 --> 01:47:20.121
It's kind of the whole cast of Connie or comes back for get Ben Lawn Hitler's

1910
01:47:20.401 --> 01:47:24.180
death day.
Who's a top CEO?
Who's a top CEO?
Who's his number one killer.
Ready?

1911
01:47:25.710 --> 01:47:27.660
Charlie Sheen.
Yeah.
That's great.

1912
01:47:27.661 --> 01:47:31.080
One killer Charlie Sheen was in the movie navy seals,
Bro.
Oh,
that's right.

1913
01:47:31.081 --> 01:47:34.710
He was in navy seals.
We can make them the top navy seal in hot shots.
Ooh,

1914
01:47:34.711 --> 01:47:39.000
there you go dude.
And Major League.
Come on son.
He's all American.

1915
01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.140
Yeah,
he could be the top of the cop car and Dolph Lundgren makes it come back as

1916
01:47:43.141 --> 01:47:47.790
well,
but dies before they complete their mission.
Boy,
here we go.
Let's make it.

1917
01:47:47.820 --> 01:47:50.740
You know what your,
your idea is not accessible enough.

1918
01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.450
Why don't we make it really?
Yeah,
let's make it was pretty mainstream.

1919
01:47:53.451 --> 01:47:57.190
Let's make it dads.
Let's make it recently divorced dads,

1920
01:47:57.300 --> 01:48:00.960
team dads and they're talking to their daughter on the phone and you know,

1921
01:48:00.990 --> 01:48:03.980
daddy loves you.
You want to just like Chloe and bullets into of channel.

1922
01:48:05.670 --> 01:48:09.090
Yeah.
And the ex wife,
they wind up getting back together again.

1923
01:48:09.091 --> 01:48:11.490
Right at the end of the movie,
Steve Gutenberg,

1924
01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:16.650
kids in a navy seal.
You Remember Steve Gutenberg?

1925
01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:19.770
I said Alicia Silverstone or playing.
I was like,
who the hell is that?

1926
01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:22.680
I don't even remember what happened to them.
Do you have a kid?

1927
01:48:23.250 --> 01:48:27.610
What happened to Gutenberg went crazy now.
Yeah,
Gutenberg.
Uh,

1928
01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:32.460
there's a famous,
a scene of him outside of Phil Hartman's house after the,

1929
01:48:32.461 --> 01:48:36.270
uh,
after the shooting,
after his wife killed him and then killed herself,

1930
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:37.021
Steve Girton,

1931
01:48:37.021 --> 01:48:41.970
Gutenberg showed up for the photo op with a suit and tie on and started doing

1932
01:48:41.971 --> 01:48:46.020
interviews with the press,
pleading with the,
uh,

1933
01:48:46.050 --> 01:48:51.030
the media to have some class and taste and handle this with dignity and to leave

1934
01:48:51.031 --> 01:48:53.310
the family alone.
But the way he was doing it,

1935
01:48:53.311 --> 01:48:57.930
it was like so clearly him just trying to get attention.

1936
01:48:58.290 --> 01:49:02.370
It was the craziest thing I've ever seen with cars.
We,

1937
01:49:02.371 --> 01:49:04.110
us as a cast,

1938
01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:09.060
never remembered Steve Gutenberg coming up from Phil wasn't like my best bud.

1939
01:49:09.061 --> 01:49:11.190
Steve Gutenberg,
we're going fishing this weekend.
You,

1940
01:49:11.191 --> 01:49:14.760
I was like Steve Gutenberg's just sort of like,
I'm just gonna neighbor all,

1941
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:17.000
I don't know.
Maybe it's just like a next door neighbor and no,

1942
01:49:17.010 --> 01:49:19.860
I don't believe he was man.
And if he was,
why would you come out and say hi,

1943
01:49:19.861 --> 01:49:24.420
this is where I would ever come visit.
Yeah,
well it's,
you know,

1944
01:49:24.450 --> 01:49:28.470
it's that,
that,
that want to be famous thing,
man.
You know,
I want it goes away.

1945
01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:31.860
There's nothing weirder than someone who used to be famous and isn't anymore and

1946
01:49:31.861 --> 01:49:36.180
really desperately wants to be again.
Very strange man.
You know,

1947
01:49:36.181 --> 01:49:39.540
you ever met a guy that's in a band and the band was big and now they're not big

1948
01:49:39.541 --> 01:49:42.210
anymore and they're all weirded out.
Yeah,
I've seen it.

1949
01:49:42.330 --> 01:49:47.070
It's a weird fucking symptom and I've seen it on before,
Joe.

1950
01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:48.200
It's disgusting.

1951
01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:52.300
Navy seal team sealed six team of light used to be famous.

1952
01:49:52.540 --> 01:49:55.840
Now he's not.
There's only one way to win back his fame.

1953
01:49:56.610 --> 01:49:59.200
Kill the man who tried to destroy America.
Yeah.

1954
01:49:59.201 --> 01:50:02.590
That's why I want my movies to have aliens in them.
That's why I liked avatar.

1955
01:50:02.591 --> 01:50:05.920
Yeah.
It was simple.
Yeah,
I saw the whole thing common.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1956
01:50:05.921 --> 01:50:09.520
I knew that the guy was going to be good in the end.
I knew it.
However,

1957
01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:12.940
it was good cause there was aliens and it was fake.

1958
01:50:12.941 --> 01:50:17.140
It wasn't like some stupid real life situation that you're trying to recreate or

1959
01:50:17.141 --> 01:50:17.700
you know,

1960
01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:21.460
like that's the one thing that drives me the most nuts is people that want you

1961
01:50:21.461 --> 01:50:24.760
to go see it.
Really depressing movies,
you know,

1962
01:50:24.761 --> 01:50:27.700
really depressing dark movies and you're like,

1963
01:50:27.701 --> 01:50:32.260
well I can live that man.
I can see that until I can.
I don't know.
I,

1964
01:50:32.350 --> 01:50:34.660
when I go to the movies,
I just want to be entertained.

1965
01:50:35.620 --> 01:50:38.140
Now have you seen the fucking speaking depressing movies?

1966
01:50:38.410 --> 01:50:43.270
Have you seen the antichrist?
What?
Have you seen the movie,
the antichrist?
No.

1967
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:47.860
What does that Jesus fucking Christ,
I'm just one of the most,

1968
01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:52.420
does it pressing dark now?
It's not new,
but it is.
It has some of the most,
well,

1969
01:50:52.421 --> 01:50:57.280
I mean it's moderately new.
It's um,
it is so fucked up.

1970
01:50:57.281 --> 01:51:00.600
Man is an American movie.
What is it?
It's,
Oh,
here.
I'm looking at it here.

1971
01:51:00.650 --> 01:51:02.870
While I've got a lot of stars,
it's really good.

1972
01:51:02.890 --> 01:51:05.260
Grieving couple retreats to their cabin in the woods,

1973
01:51:05.261 --> 01:51:08.050
hoping to repair their broken hearts and troubled marriage.

1974
01:51:08.080 --> 01:51:12.280
But nature takes its course and things go from bad to worse.
Yeah.

1975
01:51:12.281 --> 01:51:17.281
That doesn't even 1% describe how fucked up it is.

1976
01:51:18.250 --> 01:51:20.080
Oh yeah.
It's really good.
But I mean,
I can't,

1977
01:51:20.081 --> 01:51:21.700
I don't want to do any spoiler alerts here,

1978
01:51:21.701 --> 01:51:26.701
but there is some fucking does thousand shit that happens and it's 2009 Willem

1979
01:51:27.701 --> 01:51:32.700
defoe stars.
Lars van tree or is that his name?
The director.
Yeah.
You,

1980
01:51:32.710 --> 01:51:36.350
you,
you're on the ball son.
It just popped into my head.
I don't know.

1981
01:51:36.380 --> 01:51:40.420
I usually can't remember my own name.
So,
uh,
this is depressing.

1982
01:51:40.421 --> 01:51:44.410
Is it going to be sad?
Yeah.
I mean you're gonna.
It's gonna.
Yeah,

1983
01:51:44.411 --> 01:51:48.940
it's depressing and sad and fucked up.
I want,
I'm a monster movie.
Do it.

1984
01:51:48.941 --> 01:51:51.280
I don't want that nonsense.
What about the walking dead?

1985
01:51:51.281 --> 01:51:55.600
If you seen the walking and watching it?
Yeah.
So good.
It's great.
Fucking love it,

1986
01:51:55.601 --> 01:51:59.590
man.
Just got done with the episode one.
I'm gearing up number two tonight.

1987
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:03.760
I'm so pissed that they're not making another until next year.
Why I,

1988
01:52:03.761 --> 01:52:05.320
I'm not sure exactly what happened.

1989
01:52:05.321 --> 01:52:09.310
I know the guy fired all as writers supposedly at the end of this season.

1990
01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:12.880
That's something I heard and yeah,
it's,
but apparently it's based,

1991
01:52:12.910 --> 01:52:16.540
it's based on a comic book,
which now I want to read from watching it.

1992
01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:20.800
But it's like what's so cool about it man is an other Zombie movies.

1993
01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:25.540
They never explore the emotional impact that being in a Zombie apocalypse would

1994
01:52:25.541 --> 01:52:29.980
take on you and that what the directing of the acting and that he's really good

1995
01:52:29.981 --> 01:52:33.040
at directing people like how to act when they're in shock,

1996
01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.380
which is what you'd pretty much be in if you are dealing with that kind of like

1997
01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:42.430
event happening.
Why is that such a prevalent theme?
The Zombie theme?

1998
01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:46.040
Why is that so reoccurring?
I mean at all,
the

1999
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.240
<v 0>potential monsters is like the two big ones are vampires and zombies.</v>

2000
01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.200
What is that?
It's gotta be some kind of guys,
subconscious,

2001
01:52:54.201 --> 01:52:58.790
cultural projection of our realization that we're all kind of wandering through

2002
01:52:58.791 --> 01:53:01.790
life like zombies.
You know?
Not really that way.

2003
01:53:01.791 --> 01:53:03.680
People are acting as kind of this bizarre,

2004
01:53:03.710 --> 01:53:06.980
like they're just thinking about eating.
I mean,
not brains,

2005
01:53:06.981 --> 01:53:08.990
but all they're thinking about is like,
I want to have a nice,

2006
01:53:08.991 --> 01:53:10.470
you really think that's what it is.
Cause the,
the,

2007
01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:15.080
the fear is not just to be a Zombie.
The fear is to get the Zombie to eat.
You.

2008
01:53:15.260 --> 01:53:17.300
I think the real fear is people fear,

2009
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:21.920
afraid of cannibalism and people breaking down in d becoming,
you know,

2010
01:53:22.160 --> 01:53:26.720
monsters.
Well I mean,
yeah,
I think,
I guess I'm going a little like two,
uh,
two.

2011
01:53:26.721 --> 01:53:31.580
I just smoked Joe Rogan's we'd d I think that um,
uh,
yeah,

2012
01:53:31.581 --> 01:53:35.150
I mean fuck that is a scary idea is like seeing like,
yeah,

2013
01:53:35.151 --> 01:53:39.650
what's worse than being chomped on by humans that moment when they rip you apart

2014
01:53:39.651 --> 01:53:43.100
and put their intestines around their neck.
Why does Aamis always do that?

2015
01:53:43.190 --> 01:53:46.310
It's cool.
Looks it looks cool on TV.
Oh Dustin's,

2016
01:53:46.311 --> 01:53:49.190
they always have to wear what they wear and they rub their faces in.

2017
01:53:49.191 --> 01:53:53.780
It's so gross.
But why did I do that?
Just eat,
just eat.

2018
01:53:53.781 --> 01:53:55.010
Stop playing with your food.

2019
01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:00.890
What's your all time favorite Zombie movie?
Um,
there's only one answer.

2020
01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:06.050
Great answer by the way.
It used to be done at the dead until 28 days later.

2021
01:54:06.530 --> 01:54:10.820
Oh yeah.
Just the best one.
20 days later,
Shauna to 28 days.

2022
01:54:10.830 --> 01:54:14.360
10 days later.
You know when I loved that they ran at you,
they ran,

2023
01:54:14.361 --> 01:54:18.010
I'm not into these slow ass zombies.
He could just pick off with guns.

2024
01:54:18.110 --> 01:54:20.030
The evolution of the Zombie there,

2025
01:54:20.120 --> 01:54:24.040
the evolution of the Zombie is it's a disease and they run it.
Well that's it.

2026
01:54:24.110 --> 01:54:29.110
That's my big problem with zombies is that you're like people in Egypt who had

2027
01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:34.790
like regular minds and didn't want to eat brains.

2028
01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:39.200
It took them a long time to overthrow the regime there.
You know what I mean?

2029
01:54:39.201 --> 01:54:42.890
But somehow zombies are able to overthrow the military and every one of these

2030
01:54:42.891 --> 01:54:46.680
movies,
like the military can't stop these shuffling more on,

2031
01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.080
there's like,
there's like tanks turned over somehow.

2032
01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:53.140
Like what exactly do they do?

2033
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:58.300
They turned over the day like,
what do you,

2034
01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:01.640
what we need to do is send zombies to Libya to overthrow the government.

2035
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:05.930
Drone attacks aren't working well we,
that's what zombies would do.

2036
01:55:05.931 --> 01:55:07.700
They would become a new military weapon.

2037
01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:11.210
They would just send a bunch of zombies in an airplane carrier and just let them

2038
01:55:11.211 --> 01:55:16.040
lose their shuffle out.
Think you're talking about seal team seven

2039
01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:21.800
team like it.
I like it.

2040
01:55:22.190 --> 01:55:26.150
Find Osama zombies.
I don't,
what the fuck is that about man?

2041
01:55:26.960 --> 01:55:31.100
The Zombie thing.
Zillow.
It's you don't love them too.
People love Zombie movies,

2042
01:55:31.101 --> 01:55:33.500
man.
There's a guaranteed core group of humans.

2043
01:55:33.501 --> 01:55:36.830
You're going to get every Zombie movie you make.
There's a core audience.

2044
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:38.900
You've got new Zombie movie coming out.
Boom.

2045
01:55:38.990 --> 01:55:41.870
You're going to get a certain percentage of people and I'm one of them.
Yeah,

2046
01:55:41.871 --> 01:55:44.100
me too.
Fucking love that shit.
I can get me

2047
01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:47.400
<v 5>for every monster movie.
Everything you got bro.
What do you got?
Dragons.
Yeah,</v>

2048
01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.050
we go there.
You got rules?
Yeah.
Werewolf's there's no way I could avoid it.

2049
01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.830
It's impossible.
Just check my Wikipedia page.

2050
01:55:57.090 --> 01:55:58.380
Somebody says right now.
Yeah,

2051
01:55:58.410 --> 01:56:01.920
so when he said that during the twilight series are all [inaudible] to the

2052
01:56:01.921 --> 01:56:05.370
wearable.
We've been like saying to people like,
you know,

2053
01:56:05.371 --> 01:56:08.430
I'm not saying you know that you should put this on Wikipedia,
but if you do,

2054
01:56:08.431 --> 01:56:09.264
I'm not going to change it.

2055
01:56:12.860 --> 01:56:17.760
So it says,
it says I'm on some man,
Shit.
It says,
oh,
by the way,

2056
01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:21.060
I did Massey Hall in Toronto on Friday night,

2057
01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:25.680
2,600 podcast fans.
It was like all podcasts,

2058
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:29.220
except there's one dude who brought his teenage son who apparently didn't read

2059
01:56:29.221 --> 01:56:31.590
the signs.
I guess he didn't know what he's getting into.

2060
01:56:31.591 --> 01:56:34.560
Like his son probably likes MMA and I'm like,
go see the fear factor guy.

2061
01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.300
There's signs that say warning,

2062
01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:40.260
the Joe Rogan show will contain the strongest language and material content

2063
01:56:40.290 --> 01:56:43.560
imaginable.
That's what I came up with.
So that you can't,

2064
01:56:43.590 --> 01:56:45.000
you can't say that I didn't warn you.

2065
01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:49.200
It says the strongest imaginable and I might be right.
And apparently during the,

2066
01:56:49.201 --> 01:56:53.400
um,
there's just one port and my joke where I talk about a fake baby getting his

2067
01:56:53.401 --> 01:56:57.800
dick sucked and he didn't like it.
They think he got up in a huff and left.

2068
01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:00.540
I heard about some for some people that were in their section I couldn't have

2069
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:04.350
possibly known cause the joke was killing and there was thousands and thousands

2070
01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:08.430
of people that Massey Hall is fucking huge.
It's huge.

2071
01:57:08.610 --> 01:57:11.640
It's so crazy doing like a show like that where there's that many people.

2072
01:57:11.641 --> 01:57:14.630
That's the most I've ever performed for.
And uh,

2073
01:57:15.210 --> 01:57:19.140
I'm glad I'm doing that thing lately where I do like an hour and 10 something

2074
01:57:19.141 --> 01:57:23.010
like that.
Just the best way to do it,
man.
I did an hour and 10 just,

2075
01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:26.460
just stomped it and it was,
I was so amped up for that show.

2076
01:57:26.461 --> 01:57:29.610
It was the first show in a long time that I was actually kind of nervous for

2077
01:57:29.940 --> 01:57:34.050
like as I was walking,
not nervous like oh I'm scared,
but like,

2078
01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:37.680
like all day I was like,
oh I got a big fucking show tonight.
Right.
You know,

2079
01:57:37.681 --> 01:57:41.070
and when you go on stage and there's 2,600 people in there screaming and it's

2080
01:57:41.071 --> 01:57:43.080
super intimate to the way it's set up.
Like,

2081
01:57:43.081 --> 01:57:46.020
cause there's three tiers and they're like pretty much in your face.

2082
01:57:46.021 --> 01:57:49.530
They're all in your face.
2,600 of them.
Wow.
Fucking awesome.

2083
01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:53.890
And Doug Benson was there and Doug Benson was hanging out with his buddy who's

2084
01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:58.290
his opening act and um,
you know,
he was just,
he,
he goes,
I go,

2085
01:57:58.291 --> 01:58:00.720
what are you doing tonight?
And he goes,
nothing.
I go,
come down to the show.

2086
01:58:00.870 --> 01:58:03.520
So he came down and go,
you want to go on stage?
She goes,
yeah.
So I just,

2087
01:58:03.530 --> 01:58:05.870
and I introduced him at the beginning.
We also got Doug Benson,

2088
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:06.990
he and they went fucking crazy.

2089
01:58:07.610 --> 01:58:10.660
He goes out and does 10 minutes and just crush it.
Crush,
triple.

2090
01:58:10.661 --> 01:58:13.440
He goes up and crushes.
It was insane.

2091
01:58:13.441 --> 01:58:16.140
The crowd was so fucking cool.
I mean,

2092
01:58:16.141 --> 01:58:17.610
you're always going to get a certain amount of Douche bags.

2093
01:58:17.611 --> 01:58:20.790
Like I read a couple things on Twitter about people getting kicked out for

2094
01:58:20.791 --> 01:58:23.580
yelling things.
Maybe somebody got kicked out during Sam's,
Zack.

2095
01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:27.200
But that's just the virtue of the fact there's 2,600 people.
There's,

2096
01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:30.810
you're getting a certain percentage of shitheads UFC weekend and Canadian GSB.

2097
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:35.070
But other than that,
man,
the fucking crowd was amazing.
I mean,
it was incredible.

2098
01:58:35.190 --> 01:58:37.740
When I went,
when I was performing with you,
where are we?

2099
01:58:37.770 --> 01:58:41.100
Where did we perform at Montreal?
Montreal.
There was a guy,

2100
01:58:41.230 --> 01:58:45.400
he wasn't Achler any really.
I mean,
he's an idiot for yelling during your show,

2101
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:47.560
but I really know he didn't mean any harm by it,

2102
01:58:47.800 --> 01:58:52.800
but there's a guy in the VacuCap yelling parameds oh yeah,

2103
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:54.760
their meds.

2104
01:58:55.150 --> 01:58:58.480
He was just like naming things like he wanted me to do the joke about the

2105
01:58:58.481 --> 01:59:00.190
pyramid aliens.
Yeah,

2106
01:59:00.191 --> 01:59:04.720
but it went on for the whole show and he was so drunk and it was so important to

2107
01:59:04.721 --> 01:59:06.960
him.
They,
he's talked about the pyramids.

2108
01:59:07.360 --> 01:59:10.450
He kept looking at his friend with this like really serious,

2109
01:59:10.451 --> 01:59:12.850
dramatic look in his face.
Like,
I'm going to get him to do it,
bro.

2110
01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.350
I know I can get them to do it.

2111
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:19.870
That is the problem with talking about like really heady trippy shit as you get

2112
01:59:19.871 --> 01:59:22.780
a certain percentage of people,
like my friend who thought he was Carl Young,

2113
01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:26.710
who have to come up to you now to talk to you about things and take what you do

2114
01:59:26.711 --> 01:59:29.620
very,
very seriously.
It's like,
you know,

2115
01:59:29.740 --> 01:59:34.740
the vast majority of the hardcore Bill Hicks fans are amongst that.

2116
01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:39.130
You know what I mean?
That's sure.
The important,
like we were saying is important.

2117
01:59:39.131 --> 01:59:41.110
What's going on is important.
How about this?

2118
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:43.570
How about this message you get from time to time?

2119
01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:47.470
I thought you should know that I was a fan of your podcast,

2120
01:59:47.471 --> 01:59:52.090
but I could not believe that some of the things you said in your last episode we

2121
01:59:52.091 --> 01:59:56.230
got,
we get that with my podcast all the time.
That you just lost a listener.
Like,

2122
01:59:56.440 --> 01:59:57.071
you know what I mean?

2123
01:59:57.071 --> 02:00:00.910
This thing where you're trying to hurt me by saying you're taking your patronage

2124
02:00:00.911 --> 02:00:04.420
away from the free content I'm putting up.
It's like,
what are you,

2125
02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:08.330
what is the attitude of it's a child's attitude is what it is.
Instead of,
uh,

2126
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:10.660
you know,
having some sort of a discussion or a debate,

2127
02:00:10.661 --> 02:00:14.710
I am more than willing to look at someone,
you know,
they say,
you know,

2128
02:00:14.890 --> 02:00:16.720
send me something and says,
Hey,
you know,

2129
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:19.510
I think you guys are like a little insensitive.
I love the podcast,

2130
02:00:19.511 --> 02:00:22.000
but here's where I think you're wrong.
Or I can Twitter,

2131
02:00:22.001 --> 02:00:25.740
like someone said that about,
about top gear.
Like I was making fun of a,

2132
02:00:25.741 --> 02:00:29.590
all these people for criticizing top gear about their comments about Mexico

2133
02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:33.670
until I heard the separate group of comments that everyone was upset about.

2134
02:00:33.671 --> 02:00:37.360
I had read some shit that wasn't very offensive at all and to me was a joke.

2135
02:00:37.450 --> 02:00:42.220
But then I read and watch the video of the real stuff and I was like,
oh,
okay.

2136
02:00:42.250 --> 02:00:44.500
You know,
I'm more than willing to be set hit.

2137
02:00:44.501 --> 02:00:47.980
But the guy who did it was very polite and very cool about it.
He didn't,

2138
02:00:48.090 --> 02:00:52.360
you know,
oh I guess you're just a jackass and a fucking loser on follow.

2139
02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:56.810
You know what is in caps?
It's a child that's a little temper Tantrum,

2140
02:00:57.090 --> 02:00:59.620
very stressed out child,
which is fine for me,
man.

2141
02:00:59.620 --> 02:01:01.870
When you do something like that,
you don't get a chance to follow me again.

2142
02:01:01.871 --> 02:01:03.700
I block you cause I don't want to deal with children.

2143
02:01:03.701 --> 02:01:04.960
I don't want to deal with your nonsense.

2144
02:01:05.110 --> 02:01:07.720
You want to send me something to try to make my feelings her for no reason like

2145
02:01:07.721 --> 02:01:11.170
that.
It's not going to work and I'm going to block you.
It's that simple.

2146
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.000
Thank how stressed out you have to be.

2147
02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:17.650
Well does he lies into our podcast and be like,
this is the last straw.
And you,

2148
02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:21.360
you compose a patch.
Most of them are not even that stressed out there.

2149
02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:25.810
You are the target of the day to distract themselves.
Fucked up horde,

2150
02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:30.490
horrifying shit.
Hole of a life they're living right.
It's not you.

2151
02:01:30.491 --> 02:01:32.200
It's not what you did.
That's so terrible.

2152
02:01:32.201 --> 02:01:34.690
And you might look if someone agrees with you or disagrees with you,

2153
02:01:34.691 --> 02:01:38.920
it's just a thought and an idea of posing thought and idea to be considered and

2154
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:40.760
accepted or rejected.
It's that simple.

2155
02:01:40.761 --> 02:01:45.350
It's like when you get all angry about it and you know that's what you've said

2156
02:01:45.351 --> 02:01:48.470
is really fucked up.
Yeah.
And sometimes by the way,
it's great like,

2157
02:01:48.471 --> 02:01:51.890
cause I say so many blatantly wrong things like bad,

2158
02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:56.690
like bad facts,
like really bad.
It's hard to,
I mean,

2159
02:01:56.691 --> 02:01:59.000
and ministers sit right in front of a laptop,

2160
02:01:59.030 --> 02:02:01.850
which can do if you want next time I'm thinking of getting you a laptop.

2161
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:05.640
Oh that'd be cool.
So you,
while you're talking,
you have to panic and go with me.

2162
02:02:05.650 --> 02:02:07.580
This,
look this up real quick.
Make sure I got this right.

2163
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:10.550
It would save a lot of humiliation man.
Cause like I get,

2164
02:02:10.551 --> 02:02:14.090
like I'm saying shit wrong there.
Happens all the time it happened.

2165
02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:16.050
<v 7>It's with,
uh,
with um,
uh,</v>

2166
02:02:16.080 --> 02:02:18.990
Kaolin Kaolin all the time like fucks up and then has come back.

2167
02:02:18.991 --> 02:02:23.670
But look it w w and in that figuring it out and in that,
you know,

2168
02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:27.240
and looking up those facts is,
you know,
in message boards and discussions,

2169
02:02:27.241 --> 02:02:29.550
we all grow.
We all find out.
Like,
like I said,

2170
02:02:29.551 --> 02:02:32.100
when I put up the thing about the Photoshop thing about Obama's birth

2171
02:02:32.101 --> 02:02:33.600
certificate,
I'm like,
I don't know what's going on.

2172
02:02:33.601 --> 02:02:36.390
Somebody tell me what's going on.
You know,
and a lot of people would like,

2173
02:02:36.510 --> 02:02:38.880
why would the government do this?
That speculation.
Shut up.

2174
02:02:39.090 --> 02:02:42.690
Let's get to the heart of this.
What is going on here?
Photoshop wise?
You know,

2175
02:02:42.770 --> 02:02:43.530
it's,
it's,

2176
02:02:43.530 --> 02:02:47.670
it's so important to have this sort of a back and forth exchange with people

2177
02:02:47.671 --> 02:02:51.180
online.
You know,
it's not just throwing something out at,
um,
you know,

2178
02:02:51.210 --> 02:02:54.340
the reason why this podcast really works honestly is,

2179
02:02:54.341 --> 02:02:59.341
is that it's like people who are tuning into a cool conversation amongst friends

2180
02:02:59.581 --> 02:03:04.410
and sometimes they contribute sometimes,
like it's sometimes tweets contribute.

2181
02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.720
You know,
there's many,
many of discussions.

2182
02:03:07.170 --> 02:03:09.780
Many of the discussions that we've had on this podcast are based on things that

2183
02:03:09.781 --> 02:03:11.070
someone will send me.
You know,

2184
02:03:11.071 --> 02:03:13.800
someone will send me something on Twitter and I go,
dude,
you got to look at this,

2185
02:03:13.801 --> 02:03:17.010
check this out.
I'm gonna,
I'm gonna read you the story and you know,

2186
02:03:17.011 --> 02:03:21.930
and it's this into,
you know,
inner woven network of,
of ideas and people

2187
02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:24.980
<v 5>shit.
That's what it's really all about.
Someone sent me,
um,</v>

2188
02:03:25.010 --> 02:03:27.260
something from doing this podcast,

2189
02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:32.180
which is the type of music that I'd never listened to called dubstep and a band

2190
02:03:32.181 --> 02:03:34.790
called excision.
Have you ever heard of them before?
No.

2191
02:03:35.330 --> 02:03:39.080
I keep hearing about dubstep.
Fucking tripping,
man.
It's so weird.

2192
02:03:39.081 --> 02:03:43.100
It's really cool.
I don't know if like that makes me an idiot for liking it,

2193
02:03:43.101 --> 02:03:46.970
but I really do like it is pull it up,
pull it up.
What does it cause we'll,
we'll,

2194
02:03:46.980 --> 02:03:51.030
we'll end and then we'll play this as we're leaving.
Yeah.
Play.
I,

2195
02:03:51.130 --> 02:03:53.580
the one I've heard is called swag at it.

2196
02:03:53.590 --> 02:03:56.060
You've got to come on this podcast once a month.
This is ridiculous.

2197
02:03:56.120 --> 02:04:00.170
I was judging,
I loved schedule you every,
every third week.
Great.

2198
02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:02.510
I'll have it done.
I'll put it in my council every third week.

2199
02:04:02.540 --> 02:04:04.220
The conversations we have are my most fun.

2200
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:08.480
You're my number one favorite podcast guest on number one.
No one's even close.

2201
02:04:09.300 --> 02:04:11.450
There's a few people that are close.
There's a bunch of them.

2202
02:04:11.451 --> 02:04:13.250
I love all of them in their own little way.
But you're my favorite.

2203
02:04:13.800 --> 02:04:16.580
They can all go fuck themselves.
They want to argue about it.
Ah,

2204
02:04:16.581 --> 02:04:21.450
I love all you guys.
Dunkin's number one.
Okay.
Stop it even more than Joey does.

2205
02:04:22.210 --> 02:04:24.770
Joey Diaz will get mad at you.
Sometimes stuck in,
never gets mad at you.

2206
02:04:24.970 --> 02:04:26.090
Let's say you fucking Momo.

2207
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:31.100
You over there with your fucking don't stop in locked.
Meanwhile,

2208
02:04:31.101 --> 02:04:35.200

What do you got swag is that song?

I have a show coming up in San Francisco.

2211
02:04:41.941 --> 02:04:46.410
I will be at Cobb's comedy club and it looks like I'm doing that with Tripoli

2212
02:04:46.411 --> 02:04:48.660
and Thompson girl.
When are we going to do some more dates,

2213
02:04:48.661 --> 02:04:50.640
I know you've been busy.
I haven't been going up,
man.

2214
02:04:50.641 --> 02:04:53.580
I gotta I need at least two months of going up every night because I've been

2215
02:04:53.581 --> 02:04:58.140
working on your,
your pilot,
right?
Yeah.
Can you tell anybody anything about that?

2216
02:04:58.500 --> 02:05:01.320
It's a science show called,

uh,

2218
02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:07.560
well I don't want to go and say that it's just a science show for comedy central

2219
02:05:07.561 --> 02:05:11.470
on the pilot was a about the research that they've started doing it and still

2220
02:05:11.620 --> 02:05:14.250
it's still assignment and you've been super happy about everything.

2221
02:05:14.310 --> 02:05:15.780
We're going to keep everybody up to date about it.

2222
02:05:15.781 --> 02:05:18.690
We can't let too much information out.
Very,
it's fucking awesome.

2223
02:05:18.691 --> 02:05:23.090
It looks really cool.
I got,
you know,
I got set on fire for it.
Uh,

2224
02:05:23.160 --> 02:05:27.330
when will you know whether or not you,
you can actually,
people can watch it.
Um,

2225
02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:31.020
I don't know.
Probably June or something like that.
They'll make it as safe.

2226
02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:32.880
We'll keep you,
keep you posted.

2227
02:05:32.910 --> 02:05:37.320
Everybody who's interested and fall Dunkin on Twitter.
It's Duncan Trussell,

2228
02:05:37.350 --> 02:05:41.700
t r,
U S,
s e l.
L.
And you could also get him,

2229
02:05:41.730 --> 02:05:44.250
do you have artistic terrorism.com anymore or you've got rid of that?

2230
02:05:44.280 --> 02:05:48.130
That's gone.
I haven't,
Duncan Trussell doc got hacked.
Yeah.

2231
02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:52.860
Go to Duncan trussell.com and stare into the void.
It's just a black screen.
Yeah.

2232
02:05:52.920 --> 02:05:54.040
Catch 'em on Twitter.
Um,

2233
02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:59.190
we have shows coming up in San Francisco that is May 12th,
13th and 14th.

2234
02:05:59.220 --> 02:06:03.900
Um,
tickets are almost sold out for all the shows.
So a jump on that shit.
And uh,

2235
02:06:04.260 --> 02:06:06.870
we should have a good time.
They're my friends.

2236
02:06:06.900 --> 02:06:10.650
And then the next Gig I got coming up,
well maybe,

2237
02:06:10.651 --> 02:06:13.070
probably sounds comedy hall.
I don't know what's going on there.

2238
02:06:13.071 --> 02:06:16.110
They're doing construction.
What's happening?
There's two weeks,
you know,

2239
02:06:16.111 --> 02:06:18.760
I looked in the kitchen and there was not one thing different,
you know,

2240
02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:23.030
in the kitchen.
So 100% the same.
And then June I got um,

2241
02:06:23.160 --> 02:06:28.060
June 10th coming up at the vogue theater and that's in,
uh,
oh,

2242
02:06:28.061 --> 02:06:31.440
excuse me,
June 9th at the vogue theater and that's in Vancouver.

2243
02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:34.680
That's on a Thursday night at the vogue theater in the Vlog is supposed to be

2244
02:06:34.681 --> 02:06:39.210
shit.
I can't wait.
And half the tickets were sold out last week.

2245
02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:42.780
So by now it's probably like three quarters souls.
If you want to get in,

2246
02:06:42.781 --> 02:06:46.800
get in bitches.
I can't bring Joey Diaz to Canada.
I know you all asking,

2247
02:06:46.801 --> 02:06:50.910
but it is illegal for Joey to exit and enter into your foreign country.

2248
02:06:51.340 --> 02:06:55.560
He's a fucking criminal and you've,
you fuckers in Canada are awesome,

2249
02:06:55.561 --> 02:06:57.210
but you won't even allow a Dui.

2250
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:00.690
They have a very strict no douche bag rule in Canada.

2251
02:07:00.691 --> 02:07:03.810
You can't have assaults and batteries and all kinds of stupid shit,

2252
02:07:05.190 --> 02:07:08.370
not particularly player.
Right.
You know,
I love you bunches and uh,

2253
02:07:08.371 --> 02:07:10.380
we will see you.
Uh,
I got stuff to do all week.

2254
02:07:10.381 --> 02:07:13.380
So we probably won't see you again until a Friday or Saturday.

2255
02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:16.020
That'll be the next one.
Thank you.
Bye Bye.
Bye.

2256
02:07:41.210 --> 02:07:45.320
<v 11>Drove off.
Go on.</v>

2257
02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:05.120
<v 1>Yes.
I got my swagger back.
Just got my swagger back,</v>

2258
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:09.180
<v 11>not my cup of tea.</v>

2259
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:13.550
<v 1>How high were you when you die?
This was good and it gets better.</v>

2260
02:08:13.551 --> 02:08:17.240
I don't even know if this is the right one.
I'm fine.
Excuse me going,

2261
02:08:17.330 --> 02:08:20.720
I have to give it a chance.
There's still 1600 people listening,

2262
02:08:22.790 --> 02:08:24.860
dropping rapidly as they realize I've it

2263
02:08:26.430 --> 02:08:31.430
<v 0>down to 1644 41 1636 people are getting violent right now.</v>

2264
02:08:33.791 --> 02:08:38.610
Smashing their keyboard.
Bloody knuckles.
I like that sound.

2265
02:08:38.890 --> 02:08:42.410
That's what I like making plans right now to kill him.

2266
02:08:44.100 --> 02:08:48.790
The lead upset that this weird.
Basically.
I like it.
I like that sound,

2267
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:49.750
but yeah,

2268
02:08:50.770 --> 02:08:54.270
it sounds like what would happen if you let a 10 year olds and fuck around with

2269
02:08:54.271 --> 02:08:55.104
a computer.

2270
02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:59.580
Get into garageband if choice parts

2271
02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:06.910
thousands messy are hoping and listen to this.

2272
02:09:09.250 --> 02:09:12.340
This is terrible.
Dunkin.
This makes me sad for you as a person.

2273
02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:18.640
I knew the moment.
It was just like coming over your house and finding a juice.

2274
02:09:18.641 --> 02:09:20.080
Newton poster on your wall

2275
02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:27.340
is coming out of my mouth.
He got a fucking

2276
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:34.540
teacher hazard DVD sitting on your coffee table.
This is embarrassing.

2277
02:09:34.541 --> 02:09:37.750
You have terrible taste.
Okay.
Goodnight everybody.
Thank you so much.

2278
02:09:37.751 --> 02:09:40.830
This is the good part.
What's the good part?
When is the good part coming?

2279
02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:41.673
Here's the good person.

2280
02:09:45.000 --> 02:09:48.570
The song sucks.
Sucks.
Sucks.
Couldn't suck.

2281
02:09:48.930 --> 02:09:51.760
Starting a roast for myself.
I see Jesse.

2282
02:09:52.090 --> 02:09:55.420
What's all this piano shit that this isn't it.
This is the part of the song.

2283
02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:57.650
That's the part I like

2284
02:10:02.530 --> 02:10:03.720
1572

2285
02:10:08.190 --> 02:10:11.260

It's going to just get to,

2287
02:10:12.181 --> 02:10:14.410
this is going to be the thing that tosses him over the line.

2288
02:10:14.770 --> 02:10:18.760
This crosses line and sends them curling in the gate.
I'm was right there.

2289
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:20.470
He was on the fence.
