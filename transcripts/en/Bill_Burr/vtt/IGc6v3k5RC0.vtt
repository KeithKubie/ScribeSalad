00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.150
Hey,
what's going on is bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon,

2
00:00:05.151 --> 00:00:08.880
just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast.
And Ah,

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.270
just check it it on you.

4
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.130
You cubicle dwelling cunts.
Um,
you know something,

5
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:18.470
I'd feel bad for you if you're sitting in a cubicle right now,

6
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:22.940
but I'm just so full of myself that I just don't have time to have empathy.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.050
I'm just going to sit here and a big hot tub with my own white privilege.

8
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:29.780
And speaking of other white males.
Yes.

9
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.040
Why would you have another white male on your podcast?
You know why?

10
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:38.570
Because I'm not woke.
Um,
200% wrong today,
Bill.

11
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.980
200% wrong.
It's right.

12
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.200
Just when you thought the percentage couldn't go any higher.

13
00:00:42.201 --> 00:00:46.490
I have the wonderful,
they always classy.
One of the few gentlemen.

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.300
My wife loves you like she get like that one night we all hung up.
Sorry.

15
00:00:50.301 --> 00:00:53.750
Let me just nay Craig and natives here.
Not because he loves me,

16
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.190
not because he actually tried to pass the puck to me in the slot and I still

17
00:00:58.191 --> 00:01:00.080
shot her right into the goalies fucking glove.

18
00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.060
Remember that fucking went around the defense man,

19
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.680
he's here because he has a new album comedy album that's available on iTunes and

20
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:10.680
Amazon and all over the Internet called preferred customers.
Uh,

21
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.270
one of my favorite people,
one of my favorite comics,
Nate Craig,
welcome bill.

22
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:14.760
Thanks for it.

23
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.020
<v 2>First of all,
I want to say I love,
we all love Nia as well and man,</v>

24
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:23.400
the gentleman introduction.
I,
I'll take it run and buddy.
Thank you.

25
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.560
<v 1>We talking about,
yeah,
the amount of times that you've sent flowers.</v>

26
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.930
You've sent cards because you know,
we had a kid and all of that shit.
You're,

27
00:01:30.931 --> 00:01:33.760
you're,
you're,
you're,
you're a class act.
You're a Midwest guy.

28
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.390
What does it feel to be living out here in Hollywood and just referred to as a,

29
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.380
did they treat you like a fly over comic?
Ah,
yet some of the responses

30
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.883
their responses

31
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.770
<v 2>get from,
uh,
from being from the Midwest.
There are pretty hilarious.</v>

32
00:01:48.771 --> 00:01:49.604
People just don't,

33
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.570
they think you're a Trump supporter who just say Wisconsin and people laugh in

34
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:54.980
your face.
Now.

35
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.160
You think that's because the badgers last three fucking rose bowls on a row.

36
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.620
Well that's got something to do with it.
Yeah.
How could it not?

37
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.500
You gotta you gotta they gotta do something,
man.
Whiskey like bat way.
We,

38
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.390
if you had to bet money who's taken the next title?

39
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.390
And it's hard with a college cause everybody fucking leaves.

40
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.800
But basketball you got a better chance in basketball or football.
Wisconsin,

41
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.250
Wisconsin.
Man.
We're not leaving that state.
You fucking cheesy.

42
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.270
Eaton motherfucker football for sure.
Football.
Yeah.
I don't know if I'm,

43
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.280
I thought your basketball team was all right.

44
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.820
They were until they lost their hall of fame had coach because uh,

45
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.900
<v 1>because what happened?
What happened?
Oh,
side fees is sidepiece went public.</v>

46
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.280
Oh yeah.
Why does that get you fired?
Uh,
you know,
I don't know.

47
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:44.060
I think it was really shouldn't show wife just fire you and take your fucking

48
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.840
house.
You can't be a basketball coach.
And then where does he go from there?

49
00:02:47.841 --> 00:02:51.500
Like some,
like some fucking know community college,

50
00:02:51.501 --> 00:02:54.380
like adulterous behaviors.
Okay.
No,
no

51
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.750
<v 2>man.
I think he was ready to retire.
Obviously.</v>

52
00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.890
He wanted him to get his guy the job.
So he got his,
the job.

53
00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.470
<v 1>He was like a serial killer that wanted to get caught,</v>

54
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.500
fucking banged her right down there to Hooters.

55
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.810
I want to bring it back to one of the America that I remembered where your side

56
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.050
piece didn't make you lose your job.
It was,
it was handled in house.

57
00:03:14.051 --> 00:03:15.430
You white fucking slapped you,

58
00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.570
she took you for everything that you had and then you just slowly drank herself

59
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:21.280
to death.
But it was none of my business.

60
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.700
Like why should I know that that guy was banging his what?
Oh Bang.

61
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.290
A fucking around on his wife.
He,

62
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.860
I didn't need to know any of that and definitely not a few was going to keep

63
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:33.880
going to final fours.
Yeah.
Just out of curiosity,

64
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.260
do you think if you have a side piece,

65
00:03:35.261 --> 00:03:40.261
you no longer can explain the triangle offense to incoming freshmen?

66
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.580
Like what is that like?
So many successful people,
they are college kids.

67
00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:49.570
You gotta be real focused,
but some listen,
so many successful fucking people.

68
00:03:49.571 --> 00:03:54.571
The reason why this is successful is because they have laser focus on their

69
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:59.380
career,
but everything else in their life is a mess.
Their personal life.

70
00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.030
A mess.
You sit down to talk to them.

71
00:04:01.031 --> 00:04:03.100
They got a million things on their fucking mind.
So,

72
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.620
because this guy basically doesn't have a perfect life,

73
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.390
Nate Kraig can no longer get excited about the fucking final four.
Thank you.

74
00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.250
Over a sidepiece.
I can't say it out loud,
but I'm glad you did bill.

75
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.500
I mean,
I don't know.
I uh,
I just don't like knowing that shit.

76
00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.840
I don't know.
I honestly feel that's none of my fucking business.
And I,

77
00:04:24.841 --> 00:04:29.350
I think I actually thinks it brings more pain to his wife now.
Um,
no,
I just,

78
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.450
it's just,
it's none of my fucking business.
Yeah.

79
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.750
And I don't expect anybody that they're going to be perfect,

80
00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.770
but if you get in the fucking team to the final four.

81
00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.181
Okay.

82
00:04:40.181 --> 00:04:43.840
And you're not banging kids in the shower like they were doing at Penn state.

83
00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.040
I mean,
that,
I get,
you're not,
he didn't beat up his wife.

84
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.320
This isn't what you wanted to talk about.
I mean,
I'm just saying,
hey,

85
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.960
he fucked around.
I loved them.
Bo Ryan,
Bo Ryan Hall of fame.

86
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.050
Bobo had a little Ho Ho on the side.
Huh.

87
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:07.010
And that was the best thing that ever happened in Wisconsin basketball.
And uh,

88
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.860
you know what,
um,
if you had to build a defense football,
how would I know?
I,

89
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.280
we're doing,
let's say like,
listen,
you're on,
I,

90
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.340
I'd make sure I had a male judge and I'd be like,
you know,

91
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.160
you don't get to choose the Cha.
This is Wisconsin.
This is a fly over state.

92
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.670
You know,
you guys can't even read out there.

93
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.460
You guys gave fucking read out there.
I'll use you make fucking cheese.

94
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.390
I'm sure you in Wisconsin to go to pick your judge.
I'm going to my judge,

95
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.550
just let me live this.
Meet your judges
and Hazard County.

96
00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.520
So I pick a fucking,
that's a dukes of hazard,
uh,

97
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.660
reference for all younger people.
So I'd pick a male judge,
right?

98
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.850
And I would just be like,
look,
your honor,

99
00:05:45.851 --> 00:05:49.210
can I approach the bench is too many broads in here and I don't want them to

100
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:54.190
hear this,
right?
This is my fantasy court.
So he come walking up and say,

101
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:59.160
listen,
you're a successful guy.
Right?
Okay.
Now H
hasn't you?

102
00:05:59.161 --> 00:06:01.600
Wife always made sure that you fucking,
you know,
she always knock,

103
00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:02.750
shut down a little bit.
Just see,

104
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.680
you feel like you don't get too big for your Britches,

105
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.090
no matter what you achieve.

106
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.240
She's always kind of just knocking you down a little bit just to make sure you

107
00:06:09.241 --> 00:06:13.830
know,
judge,
nobody knows better than you.
The effort,
these Yak,

108
00:06:13.831 --> 00:06:16.650
that successes.
I wasn't going that route.

109
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.380
I was going the route that she's just fucking,
you know,

110
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.990
she's still running the shit.
Like the more successful you get,

111
00:06:21.991 --> 00:06:23.250
the more they're going to knock you down.

112
00:06:23.251 --> 00:06:24.930
So there's still run and shit around the house.

113
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.550
So then what happens is is you don't fit.
He does.

114
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.680
<v 3>It's over there.
Okay.
This guys go to the final four,</v>

115
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.080
like three fucking years in a row.
Okay?

116
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.840
I don't need to tell you that you're living in this state that you got to,

117
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.810
you got to fucking badge your pin right and your rope.
Okay.

118
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.990
Probably shouldn't wear that during the trial,
like get a mistrial.
But this guy,

119
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:42.163
he's,

120
00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.120
<v 1>I am a big badger fan.
Bill,
you made a good point.</v>

121
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.120
<v 3>The Guy,
he needs a blow job every once in a while.
Sure.
And,</v>

122
00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:52.600
and it makes them relax.
It makes him here,
his team.
Okay.

123
00:06:52.601 --> 00:06:56.680
We're so close right now.
We are so close to getting a fucking title.

124
00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.530
You're saying this is for the kids.
It's for the kids.
It's a fucking sidepiece.

125
00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.650
Okay.
This is,
this is between him and his wife.
That's all I'm saying.

126
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.840
All right.
Let them settle it.
Okay.

127
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.800
I'm not saying she shouldn't take the house and everything he's got and go fuck

128
00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:16.510
one of his friends.
I'm not saying that,

129
00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:21.250
I'm just saying we are so close to a fucking championship.

130
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.820
And I,
I think I speak for the state of Wisconsin.

131
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.040
When I say you let this Man Keep coaching at your university.

132
00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.610
<v 1>They have been playing good defense lately.
They have been playing,</v>

133
00:07:34.611 --> 00:07:36.950
locked down the fence.
Lockdown,
defense.

134
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.553
<v 3>Come on.</v>

135
00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.630
<v 1>It'd be nice.
In a perfect world,
you could,
you could,
uh,</v>

136
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.510
pick your judges and your sidepiece litigation.
Yeah,
no,
that's just,
yeah,
it's a,

137
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.510
it's a,
it's a,
uh,
is,
it's Joe Rogan says this strange times.

138
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.830
It is strange and the strange time,
strange times.
What does being a,

139
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.423
<v 3>okay,</v>

140
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.940
<v 1>I saw two people on the Internet talking about how they're sick of being asked</v>

141
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:03.850
about this thing that they are both talking to each other about on Twitter.

142
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:07.840
I just wanted to tweet.
Did you two ever consider exchanging cell phone numbers?

143
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.840
What are you doing anyways?
You're a big baseball fan.

144
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.500
I'm a moderate,
moderate baseball fan.
Yeah.

145
00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:20.770
I remember when the brewers won the first game and you texted me,
he said,

146
00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:24.790
you said build ladies and gentlemen,
your Milwaukee brewers.
They,
they brought,

147
00:08:24.791 --> 00:08:27.160
they brought the fucking lumber out that they thought it was going to happen.

148
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:29.600
I thought they were gonna make it to the series.
I thought I was gonna.

149
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:32.860
I thought we were going to have a little Boston,
Milwaukee,

150
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.190
if you could see the way nature down rubbing his fucking face.
Right.

151
00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:39.790
And I just think that his eyes are soft.
They're just soft.
I'm not,
there's no,

152
00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.830
but there's only a couple of guys on that team I'm scared of.

153
00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.470
I'm pissed that we couldn't beat.
I'm like,
it's gotta be,
I said,
well son,

154
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:48.400
the guy with a red face,
it's Justin Turner,
Ms Maternity,

155
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.750
Manny Machado's get the best fucking name that should be,

156
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.820
it should have been Ballenger and then the ace to start her.
And I also like,

157
00:08:54.821 --> 00:08:57.960
by way I don't,
as I was saying to you,
I don't think Manny Machado was dirty.

158
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.060
Okay.
Ty Cobb did all of that shit and he's all over the fucking hall of fame.

159
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:03.901
Right.

160
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:08.360
Because there wasn't slow mo high def replay to show you when he kicked first

161
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.580
base fishing ankles.

162
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:13.290
I thought because it was white on white crime back then because it was an all

163
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:17.250
white league that it was okay if Tim,
if ty Cobb,

164
00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.290
uh,
you know,
spike to Ulysses,
whoever the fuck was playing second base back then,

165
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:25.620
right.
Aberdeen,
whatever the hell his fucking name was.
Right.

166
00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:30.210
I don't think ty Cobb discriminated.
Oh,
that's what I've heard.

167
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:35.790
Yeah.
You know what it was is probably a white guy who had the audacity to have a

168
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.300
little bit of a Tan that is really fucking weird about like,
you know,

169
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.510
this is like straight up racist in the hall of fame.
Do you know there was,

170
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.820
there was a fucking guy,
and I don't know if this is true or not,

171
00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:46.740
if this is just some scuttlebutt,

172
00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:50.430
but there's literally like a guy in the hall of fame,
uh,

173
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.230
who used to carry a piece from a rope from a lynching is good luck.

174
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.460
Can that be true?
Ooh,
that's a tough one.
That is worse than a side piece.

175
00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.350
And Pete rose can't get into the hall of fame because he bet on the fucking
dogs.

176
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:08.620
It comes the chief,
I like this,

177
00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.090
the scuttle butt potential scuttle butt disclaimer,

178
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.790
all because everything,
cause all I do,

179
00:10:14.791 --> 00:10:19.740
the only research I do is I talked to somebody in a bar or I search it on the

180
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:23.940
Internet and I click on the first thing and whatever it says like I was making,

181
00:10:23.941 --> 00:10:26.970
you know,
sort of in a way like a,
was it Kate Upton?

182
00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:30.690
She was chime in and on the Houston red sox series.
So I'm sitting there going,

183
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:34.980
oh,
according to Kate Upton,
which was funny to me.
And then I was like,
wow,

184
00:10:34.981 --> 00:10:35.431
isn't that cool?

185
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:38.110
She's that beautiful and she's down into baseball and somebody find brothers,

186
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:41.790
hey,
fuck head,
she's married to Justin Verlander.

187
00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:44.800
She's carrying his kid right now.
It's like,
now it makes sense now.

188
00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:48.540
It makes sense.
Okay,
I get it,
but why does it need to make sense to me?
Yeah.
Why?

189
00:10:48.541 --> 00:10:50.750
Why am I mansplaining?
Yeah.

190
00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:55.710
The only thing on my own part or anything wrong with that was the research.
Yeah.

191
00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.810
The discovery.
Well,

192
00:10:57.811 --> 00:11:01.590
I feel like I'm a victim of like the intellect that I was blessed with.

193
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.480
So I'm the victim.

194
00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:07.890
I can't help it if people are going to lie and then I'm going to read or maybe

195
00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.520
they tell the truth and I don't read it.
I think somewhere in there,

196
00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.660
in this current climate,
I could somehow become a victim there.

197
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:21.170
It's the only true victim hood is not taking responsibility for your own fucking

198
00:11:21.361 --> 00:11:25.020
actions.
Correct?
Yes.
Yeah.
Or just,
uh,

199
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:29.700
just being expected to research what it is you're having an opinion on.

200
00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.810
I have a Wisconsin question for you.
Go ahead.
You grew up there,
right?
Madison,

201
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:35.880
Wisconsin,
Madison,
smack Dab,

202
00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.880
and you could not escape Wisconsin if you want it to.

203
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.050
Like if you were walking on foot,

204
00:11:40.051 --> 00:11:42.320
how long would it take you to get to a great lake or Minnesota?

205
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:47.760
[inaudible] couple of days.
It would take me a full,
it would take me,

206
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.560
yeah,
I'd say one,
one 24 hour period on 24 period.

207
00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:57.880
All right.
In the summer of course.
Um,
okay,
so I want to know during the winter,

208
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:59.680
I want to know how you got out of there,

209
00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:04.090
out of the great state of Wisconsin with that becoming a serial killer,

210
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.790
because that is kind of on the low that if you guys weren't so good at making

211
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.700
cheese,
right?
Yeah.
Then you didn't have the packers.
Yeah,
that'd be a lie.

212
00:12:14.810 --> 00:12:18.010
If you remove those two,
no,
no knives in,
that'd be more,

213
00:12:18.011 --> 00:12:20.590
I'm just saying like that really would be,

214
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:23.530
you'd have to steer into that and that would have to be your calling card to

215
00:12:23.531 --> 00:12:27.700
basically visit all of these people's houses.
He had Jeffrey Dahmer.

216
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:29.680
You had the fucking,

217
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:33.790
the guy who basically they've made like nine different serial killer movies just

218
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.620
based off of everything that he did.

219
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:39.310
They couldn't fit it all into one script and talking about Ed Gen Ed gain,

220
00:12:40.510 --> 00:12:44.800
ed gain.
He was Hannibal Lecter.
He was the Texas chainsaw massacre guys too.

221
00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:48.100
Maybe.
I don't know.
Texas might get mad at that.
Hey,

222
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:52.600
don't be taking our fucking Sarah Killers.
They're liberal.
Fucking snowflake.

223
00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:58.320
<v 2>Fucking scared of driving.
Freckled Kahn.
I'm the only guy I know.</v>

224
00:12:58.321 --> 00:13:00.960
Defense serial killers.
I'm the only guy I know

225
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:05.360
<v 1>ever been asked or that we were on the road and we just thought that was the</v>

226
00:13:05.361 --> 00:13:08.870
funniest thing ever.
So redneck shit shit-talking all started up yet.

227
00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:13.050
<v 2>I'm the only,
I think I heard some guy on the,
on the plane or something.
Say it.</v>

228
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.140
It's just such a ridiculous way to brag about yourself.

229
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:19.140
You're the only guy I ever know.
I'm only guy I know I have.
No,

230
00:13:19.141 --> 00:13:21.720
I'm the only guy I've ever met.
I'm only guy I ever met with a pan.

231
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:25.920
Terra bathrobe.
Yeah,
Dude.

232
00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:27.150
We did that for hours.

233
00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.920
<v 1>Where will we drive was at that time we did that Gig in Winnipeg.</v>

234
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:31.780
We drove all the way up to fucking sad.

235
00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.190
<v 2>Good too.
That was a different time,
I think,</v>

236
00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:36.860
but we still had a southern accent on that for some reason.

237
00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.270
I don't know why we didn't go Canadian.

238
00:13:38.271 --> 00:13:41.660
It's just so fun to do the southern accent.
Oh,
you do with a good Canadian.

239
00:13:41.661 --> 00:13:44.900
This little,
sorry.
Oh,
sorry.
Oh,
sorry.
Oh,

240
00:13:44.901 --> 00:13:48.560
we're going up to Saskatoon w that was a fun drive.
That was so flat.

241
00:13:48.561 --> 00:13:50.500
That's the flat earth I've ever seen in my life.
Yeah,

242
00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:54.280
well that's where they farm out that way and I mean,
dude,

243
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:58.450
it was so flat that you could see the earth rounding down.
Yeah.

244
00:13:59.180 --> 00:13:59.770
Now,

245
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:04.040
and you could actually see the northern lights disappear over the flat horizon

246
00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:05.240
up there.
Man.

247
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:09.480
<v 1>I know that they farmed there as I read Bonnie Mcfarlane's book and her dad for</v>

248
00:14:09.481 --> 00:14:11.370
some reason went to like Alberta,

249
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.640
which is all rocky and you want to either have like cattle or drill for oil and

250
00:14:17.341 --> 00:14:19.530
for whatever reason he was like,
fuck this,

251
00:14:19.531 --> 00:14:21.870
I'm going to try to farm here and just made their life,

252
00:14:21.871 --> 00:14:25.230
I guess a much more difficult than it needed to be,

253
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.240
which is why she's now a comedian.

254
00:14:27.241 --> 00:14:32.241
I imagined that was your line in Winnipeg was just cause flying into that city.

255
00:14:33.421 --> 00:14:35.730
I mean it's just nothing with Oh yeah.

256
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.760
<v 2>Nothing around it.
And you're like,</v>

257
00:14:37.761 --> 00:14:42.100
I've never felt so safe landing could've landed anyway anywhere.

258
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.183
A lot of stuff.

259
00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:45.820
<v 1>Oh yeah.
Shut your eyes and just auto rotate to you.
Felt you.</v>

260
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.290
Skids touched the ground.
It's going to be level still running.
Landing.
Um,

261
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:53.090
so anyways,
let's talk about your album.
Where uh,

262
00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:56.990
where did you tape this soon to be deemed masterpiece.
Oh,

263
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:01.280
the masterpiece happened at a dynasty typewriter.
It's a new spot.

264
00:15:01.281 --> 00:15:04.010
It's at the Hayward.
I'm the only guy I ever met,

265
00:15:04.011 --> 00:15:06.800
recorded an album of the dynasty typewriter.
Couldn't tap.

266
00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:11.300
We'll sit Sandler did it.
Uh,
has part of his special there.
Who's new?
A special,

267
00:15:11.330 --> 00:15:13.910
oh I got to see that.
That just came out on the 23rd.
It's great.

268
00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:17.690
There's some of some of that is shot there.
Um,
but I am,

269
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:20.420
I am the only guy I ever met did album at the dynasty type writer.

270
00:15:20.510 --> 00:15:24.390
And you made a say day?
Uh,
yeah.
It's awesome.
Yeah.
No I didn't.

271
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:29.030
I mean it's a,
it's a great place and I'm putting my next one out on laser disk,

272
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:31.820
laser disk.
I just want the true fans to fucking get it.

273
00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:36.830
Why is my phone on making all that noise?
Um,
uh,
what did I do now?

274
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:38.660
Oh my headphones are working perfect.

275
00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:41.630
And then I had the audacity to touch something.
Can you still hear me Nate?

276
00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:45.650
Cause I can hear myself.
I can hear yourself loud and clear.

277
00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.600
Oh wait a second.
Is this going to come through?
Oh,

278
00:15:51.601 --> 00:15:56.490
guess who just got tickets?
Where are you going to go see bill ads?
Pr.

279
00:15:56.491 --> 00:16:00.270
I'm going to go to the fucking red sox.
Atta a boy.

280
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.170
Go support your team.
Go to game.

281
00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:06.120
Go to game three or four cause they ain't going to be no game.
Five buddy.

282
00:16:07.910 --> 00:16:08.743
<v 0>Okay.</v>

283
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:11.390
<v 1>Oh,
would you look at that?</v>

284
00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:17.880
Oh my God.
That's awesome.
That is awesome.
Oh,
okay.

285
00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:22.350
Billy's in the game again.
Gonna sit in the bleachers.
I'm setting up top,

286
00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:25.950
but the real people I need to be down.
Swing me downstairs talking to Jane Fonda.

287
00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:29.010
Jane.
Honestly,
how many games did you watch this year?

288
00:16:29.011 --> 00:16:31.590
Hanging out with Paula Abdul and in the dugout club.

289
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.560
You Rick cold hearted snake.

290
00:16:34.561 --> 00:16:37.590
Is that when she's saying I had the biggest fucking crush on her?

291
00:16:37.770 --> 00:16:42.110
There was so many fucking hot chicks in the late fucking a uh,

292
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:46.710
there was a chick,
uh,
uh,
what was her name?
Can't remember any of them.

293
00:16:46.711 --> 00:16:47.940
Samantha Fox.

294
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.140
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

295
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.770
<v 1>Fucking uh,
uh,
the one you just said,</v>

296
00:16:52.771 --> 00:16:56.850
Paula Abdul who was the one in um,
ah,

297
00:16:57.570 --> 00:17:02.250
cadavers hush from labyrinth and she was in requiem for a dream.

298
00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.970
The,
she's got brown hair,
goddammit.
Go.
Any weaver?
No,
I don't know.

299
00:17:06.090 --> 00:17:08.040
I'm that Sigourney weaver,
but that was at Tyler.

300
00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:09.880
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

301
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.300
<v 1>Jane Fonda.
I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
Yeah.</v>

302
00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:18.580
Paula Abdul met her at the dugout club.
You did still good looking,
right?

303
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.800
Yeah.
She's Paula Abdul.
She's great.
Didn't not visible,

304
00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:28.840
but you guys are judge her work and not the way she looks.

305
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:35.770
Opposites attract.
Uh Huh.
Could you stop being attracted?
Get the up?

306
00:17:36.580 --> 00:17:40.600
Oh yes.
Attract.
That's right.
Oh yeah.
This does fold,

307
00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:44.350
but you take two steps back.
You know what?
You know when the album was over,

308
00:17:44.351 --> 00:17:45.280
when one does that,

309
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:48.760
that's what we should be talking about was this stupid video she made with the

310
00:17:48.761 --> 00:17:52.320
cat and the had the animated cat,
which was supposed to be like,
uh,

311
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:53.460
that's when I was being like,
all right.

312
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.680
I think they're trying to get too many hits off this album.

313
00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.300
That was opposites attract.
I think that was the video for that.
Oh,
was it?

314
00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:04.170
I think so.
So easy to write a fuckin hit sign back down,
right?

315
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:09.070
Bump,
bump,
bump out up.
Bobo.
Bobo.

316
00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:13.440
I don't think it's going to be harder bulls.
It's more competitive.
Boat Boat,

317
00:18:13.441 --> 00:18:16.270
boat.
Obu,
back to my album bell.
Yeah.

318
00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.020
Dynasty type Craig Bob Bode of Scott,

319
00:18:20.021 --> 00:18:25.021
an album on the internet and blue.

320
00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:29.080
Tammy.
Nate,
how did you come up?
Sorry.

321
00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:31.510
I feel like I'm driving across country with you right now.

322
00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:34.090
You're just giddy cause you got tickets to the world series.

323
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:38.940
I'm also giddy because I had that operation men over 50 have and I find out I'm

324
00:18:38.941 --> 00:18:41.970
not going to fucking die ass cancer.
I'd fucking did that yesterday.

325
00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:45.940
What did you get put in your butthole?
And I had,
as I kept saying to Nia,

326
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.370
I go two days down,
I go Jacques Cousteau up the ass hole.

327
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:56.450
That's what I kept calling it.
I add you get a colonoscopy.
Yeah.

328
00:18:56.630 --> 00:19:01.100
So this is just a procedure.
It's a procedure.
They just sneak that camera up in.

329
00:19:01.101 --> 00:19:04.520
Yeah,
dude,
it's the easiest thing.
They meet the neighbors.

330
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:08.340
You know what the hardest fucking thing is just for everybody out there,
right.

331
00:19:08.370 --> 00:19:11.730
The hardest fucking thing is first of all,
as a guy to actually go to the doctor,

332
00:19:12.390 --> 00:19:16.140
you know,
I'm a typical guy,
he should go and say I'm fun.
Right?

333
00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.300
So,
um,
they just scare the shit out of you,
if no pun intended about this thing,

334
00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.400
because I think the colonoscopy is a bit of a scam because it used to be you got

335
00:19:25.401 --> 00:19:26.790
to get it when you're over 50.

336
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:31.020
Then it became 45 now it's 40 and it's like every 10 years now the sand to be

337
00:19:31.021 --> 00:19:33.680
five now the Santa Fe three to five,
I think they got everything,

338
00:19:33.681 --> 00:19:36.780
but now that every guy feels like it's okay to go in there,

339
00:19:36.781 --> 00:19:39.240
it doesn't mean that you're a little fucking on the fence.
You know,

340
00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.130
guys are so fucking homophobic.
I ain't get no fucking procedure.

341
00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.400
Hicham go with just fucking fake currently age.
Right.

342
00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.760
And then you die like Vince Lombardi.
That's why he died.
He was like,

343
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:49.080
they ain't putting that fucking thing up.
Me.

344
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:52.260
Granted it was also the late 1960s they just would have stuck their head in

345
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:54.780
there and be like,
Yep.
It's like you're going to die.

346
00:19:55.190 --> 00:19:58.740
Camera was way bigger back then,
but way bigger.
Is it one of those old fucking,

347
00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:04.430
what are the silent film thing as a crank on this guy with a crank literally

348
00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:06.660
inside your body.
And so he took a picture.

349
00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.510
It was that explosion with the fucking Chink,
Chink,
Chink,
Chink,
Chink.

350
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.120
Then when they took the picture and there was an explosion for the flesh,

351
00:20:12.121 --> 00:20:14.880
they had to stick that in your two.
We got to talk coach.
Yeah.

352
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.850
So anyways,
the hardest thing was,
uh,

353
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.000
the stuff you have to drink is just kind of,

354
00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.160
it's like the best tasting medicine.
It still tastes medicine.

355
00:20:27.530 --> 00:20:30.920
And then you just sort of like,
you know,
you can't eat for a day,

356
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:34.520
but then when you go there,
it's just you've,
they go,
okay,
here we go.

357
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:38.860
Here's the fucking anesthesia.
And they put it on.
Yeah.
And then you're,
you're,

358
00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.450
you're out.
You're out.
You're out.
You're out for this year out.
Ooh,
wee.

359
00:20:43.451 --> 00:20:47.020
I didn't know it was like,
yeah,
a lot of trust.
There's a lot of trust.
You're,

360
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.020
and then all of a sudden,
like a second later,
somebody goes,
all right,

361
00:20:50.021 --> 00:20:51.820
you're good.
You're like,
that's it.
That's,

362
00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:56.440
it sounds like a UFO abduction now because that's,

363
00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.150
you know,
I willfully went there,

364
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:01.870
I wasn't walking out into a field of corn pass Ed Jean's house.

365
00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:07.750
So if there's anybody out there of a certain age,
like it's,
it's,
it's easy.

366
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:12.820
I'm only guy I ever met senior Ufo at target
and I was,

367
00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:15.730
you only got to see,
um,
yeah.

368
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.070
So I'm also giddy about that cause I'm on the other side of it.

369
00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:21.490
Next month I'm getting my heart checked out.
This is all being an old debt,

370
00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.190
getting the heart checked out during the stress test.

371
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.740
And then I'm actually for the first time I life going to have like a fucking

372
00:21:26.890 --> 00:21:30.070
doctor where I'll go get a physical every year.
Hold up now are you a,

373
00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:34.300
you walking on your tiptoes today?
I a few on there buddy.
You mean?
Oh,

374
00:21:34.301 --> 00:21:37.690
I have no idea that a group of men were looking at my ass yesterday.

375
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:39.460
No clue whatsoever.
I,
you know what I mean?

376
00:21:39.461 --> 00:21:44.461
It was sort of probably the same feeling like if you got abducted by aliens,

377
00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.700
but the next day you kind of know something went down.

378
00:21:48.701 --> 00:21:49.900
But you don't really remember it.

379
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:52.540
And it's difficult to relate to other human beings,

380
00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:57.350
but that only lasts for a couple of hours.
Such your doctor,

381
00:21:57.630 --> 00:22:01.210
essentially the world series tickets,
Phil.
Yeah.
Like,
Hey,
fill this.

382
00:22:01.211 --> 00:22:04.180
Never happened.
This never happened.
No,
I am.
I'm,

383
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:06.670
I'm thrilled so I don't have to go back.

384
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:10.630
They said for another three to five years and it's just like,
all right,
so then,

385
00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:12.130
but then what's good dude?
It's like back in the day,

386
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.680
remember he got the fucking AIDS test,
right.

387
00:22:14.681 --> 00:22:16.570
And it was just like the first time you got it,

388
00:22:16.571 --> 00:22:21.400
this was every fucking check you'd ever fucking bandwidth and then it's nervous.

389
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.640
Yeah.
And then the next time he got tests and it's just the last three years,

390
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:27.070
you know,
so it's going to be the same way that I,
you know,

391
00:22:27.071 --> 00:22:31.840
I went to Mcdonald's a couple of times.
I've been eating plenty.

392
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.320
I mean,

393
00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.560
eating plenty of fucking Bali or whatever the hell are you supposed to be doing.

394
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:38.740
I've been doing all right though.
But you know,
so I'm,

395
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.790
you know what's funny though is it's still nerve wracking anytime you go to,

396
00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:47.380
I mean,
you know,
that's the,
I'm engaged in.
Awesome.
Good to go.

397
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.590
But to go in and get tested this screenings even.
Oh yeah.

398
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.160
I can't remember the first.
You remember the first yes.
Test you ever.
Yes.

399
00:22:54.161 --> 00:22:55.030
And I had the coolest,

400
00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.810
I have the coolest fucking doctor ever to look on your feet.

401
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.670
I was sitting there and he knew I was fine.

402
00:23:00.671 --> 00:23:03.940
He came walking out and he was just going to come on back.
You find,
you find,

403
00:23:03.941 --> 00:23:04.751
don't worry.
Come on back.
I was like,

404
00:23:04.751 --> 00:23:07.930
thank God he didn't do the scared straight fucking thing where he had me walk

405
00:23:07.931 --> 00:23:12.490
all the way back.
Okay,
we got your results and you know,

406
00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:16.330
look behind door number two.
He just saw it.
He says,
dude,
you're fine.
You're fine.

407
00:23:16.331 --> 00:23:21.160
It's like,
all right,
thanks.
Let me know that you came out the gate.
Yeah,
buddy.

408
00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:25.840
Yeah.
And uh,
uh,
so that was,
so,
now that I got that out of the way,

409
00:23:25.841 --> 00:23:29.590
so I'm might Goldberg got after it.
I'm going to g uh,

410
00:23:29.591 --> 00:23:30.670
I didn't really get after it,

411
00:23:30.671 --> 00:23:35.230
but I went after I went in the wrong areas of society and fucking,
uh,
you know,

412
00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.030
I was that guy,
you know,
you know,
I was standing up during battle.

413
00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.200
I shouldn't have done that,
you know,

414
00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:44.440
I should have protected myself a little better.
But that was the young me.
Yeah,

415
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.550
that was a man.
Like I grew up in the 80,
so I,
I didn't,
I didn't know any,

416
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.280
he jumped a fence at that point.
You know,

417
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:52.700
it wasn't a lot of information out there.

418
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.870
Do you know what I'm talking about at all?
You're a kid from the 90s right?
Yeah.

419
00:23:55.890 --> 00:23:57.920
I grew up with like fucking insane.

420
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.760
You're jumped the fence is a interesting saying that I haven't used [inaudible]

421
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.920
and backstreet boys or the beginning.
They were like,
if it's as long as you,

422
00:24:05.921 --> 00:24:10.460
if it was initially considered a gay disease and people who were shooting
heroin,

423
00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:12.253
I remember that.

424
00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:16.250
So there was all these homophobic jokes about it and all of this stuff about

425
00:24:16.251 --> 00:24:19.610
junkies or that type of stuff.
And then who was,

426
00:24:19.770 --> 00:24:22.550
I was probably Magic Johnson and then every was like,

427
00:24:22.551 --> 00:24:26.480
oh well he kiss fucking Isaiah and the Gi guy old fucking know about that.

428
00:24:26.481 --> 00:24:28.700
It's like,
well they do that in France all the fucking time.

429
00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:34.310
Nobody's bagging more women than those guys.
So,
uh,
that,
that was the thing.

430
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.190
Then all of a sudden it had gone into the whole,
you know,
I,
I dunno,
I dunno.

431
00:24:37.670 --> 00:24:39.770
I don't pay attention to stuff.
That's when you,
uh,

432
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.790
you got tested with the week after Magic's press conference?
No,
I got tested,

433
00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.290
uh,
mid nineties.

434
00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.690
Mid Nineties.
I did.
And I,
I was in a relationship and she's like,
yeah,

435
00:24:53.691 --> 00:24:56.880
we should both get tested.
I was just like,
yeah,
yeah,
let's do that.

436
00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.040
I'm pretty savvy with all the time.
All the time.
No,
but I remember too,

437
00:25:01.041 --> 00:25:05.300
I came out,
I was,
I was,
you know,
had nothing clean bill of health and I was just,

438
00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:09.020
I was site was fucking site,
you know,
you got lucky.

439
00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:11.570
Yeah.
You got lucky.

440
00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.280
Got Derrick Jordan three pom pom pom pom pom.
Oh,

441
00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:24.350
sorry,
that was loverboy.
Um,
that's funny.
Like they should guess.

442
00:25:24.351 --> 00:25:27.500
Like when you get tests for that,
it would be like,
all right,

443
00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.490
what bands were you listening to in high school?
I was listening to loving boy.

444
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.120
All right,
dude,
you might want to sit out for this.
But anyway,
so I'm a,
I'm so I,

445
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.220
this is some weird way that I'm promoting your album.

446
00:25:37.221 --> 00:25:41.580
And also I listened to rush so I was pretty clear that was in the clear,

447
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.140
you know,
I heard a rush song the other day that I actually,
uh,

448
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:48.680
I hadn't heard in a long time.
I really fun.
I man,
it's a great song.

449
00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:49.880
I work in man.
Yeah.

450
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:55.780
<v 4>Oh Man.
No,
no,
no.</v>

451
00:25:56.430 --> 00:26:00.950
<v 1>Oh,
the luck gay.
So I like it here.
Loverboy I'm damaged some.</v>

452
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:02.160
That's one hell of a mash up.

453
00:26:02.670 --> 00:26:05.190
Do you know how many times I heard pour some sugar on me in the summer of

454
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:08.430
[inaudible] 88.
I listened to it a lot.

455
00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:12.480
That was the hot video that summer MTV showed music.

456
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.140
I remember as a kid,
I was a little kid.
Look,

457
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.970
Mommy's playing the trumps with one end.
I thought it was cool.

458
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:26.160
I think it's really cool that they didn't fire that guy.
They stood by him.
Yeah.

459
00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.830
There's people,
all they do is meth and they're out of the fucking banned.

460
00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:32.260
That guy lost an arm and they're still like,
all right,
all right.

461
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.240
Learn how to play with your fate too.
I mean,
they just like,
I mean,

462
00:26:36.241 --> 00:26:41.000
talk about friends.
I mean,
you got to thank,
if you lose a f,

463
00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:45.870
I mean if a guitar's lost the armies out,
he's out.
Yeah.
Yeah,
you can.

464
00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:49.380
He can.
He can stand on the stage,
but he's,

465
00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:51.150
they're not going to trust him with any solos.

466
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:56.130
It's a rough one arm with no arms.
Who plays a mean guitar?

467
00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:57.540
I've seen that somewhere.

468
00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.150
They'll see me as a CSE slide for his big toe.
He uses a spoon.

469
00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:05.671
There was somebody I saw,

470
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:07.970
I had like a fucking spoon in his mouth or something like this.

471
00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.220
I like whenever I see those fucking things like,
uh,

472
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:13.230
I'm always amazed by it.

473
00:27:13.231 --> 00:27:17.460
And then also I feel like I'm at Coney Island without paying the fee.

474
00:27:17.461 --> 00:27:19.830
There's always like an element of guilt to this.
Like,

475
00:27:19.831 --> 00:27:24.600
why am I watching this fucking person?
You know,
like this is uh,
you know,

476
00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:29.280
spoon man,
his phone man playing a strong without my hands.

477
00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:30.840
My feet

478
00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.930
make me feel guilty for watching you.
Oh yeah.
Oh Man,

479
00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.990
I'm sorry.
You know,
we wait,
wait,

480
00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.690
what we're basically doing is we're just recreating what we do when we're in the

481
00:27:48.691 --> 00:27:49.524
fucking car

482
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:55.580
as we're driving up to Saskatoon.
Remember when we were in Winnipeg and we,

483
00:27:55.670 --> 00:27:58.700
we thought they were both pulling us cause we said we're going to Saks discuss

484
00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.830
tune.
They kept just kept people in the upper deck just kept going to food.

485
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.970
I thought they were bowing meals.
Just like those are good people up there.

486
00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:10.530
They are good people.
You are sold man.
I was ready to move.
You ready to move?

487
00:28:10.531 --> 00:28:14.820
Find your wife settled down.
Tune tonight.
Get yourself a little farm.

488
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.290
All those creepy serial killer fucking tools that you have no questions in ship.

489
00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:23.040
There you go.
That's right.
One side on the,

490
00:28:23.041 --> 00:28:27.720
is Trump going to make it better?
One side and the uh,
I dunno.
Whatever.

491
00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:30.600
Whatever the fuck it is.
Free ice.
Is that what you get up there?

492
00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:35.040
Just those fucking tons of free ice.
Yeah.
The ice time up there is ridiculous.

493
00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:39.380
It's all 14 months a year.
Oh No,
no.

494
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:43.130
I was in Ottawa.
I was looking,
I go,
what's up at that rank?
They go,
oh,
oh,

495
00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:46.200
if you want to skate around you can,
oh sure.
Did you bring your boots?
Yeah,

496
00:28:46.201 --> 00:28:47.490
they just had an outdoor rink.

497
00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.700
There's some woman out there figure skating during like lunch hour.

498
00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:51.900
And then I'm seeing this little kid,

499
00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.390
the mother's like teaching them how to like crossover and shit like that.

500
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:58.590
And I was just like,
this is why we went at the amateur level,
the gold metal,

501
00:28:58.591 --> 00:29:02.340
but not the pro level because they're amateurs are already in the pros.

502
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.430
And that's,
I think that's,
that's my theory why we always win the amateur one,

503
00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:09.300
but we don't,
the juniors,
sorry,
we don't win the,
uh,
the pros,

504
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.080
it's all that free ice.
We're pretty good despite,

505
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:17.850
despite the fact that we focus on every other major sport first.

506
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.450
I ain't,
you know,
some,
that's a good point.

507
00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:26.790
Despite the fact that I think that the tipping point was when roller blading was

508
00:29:26.791 --> 00:29:31.170
as popular as it was.
I and then roller hockey started getting going.

509
00:29:31.171 --> 00:29:34.320
I thought then we were going to be able to compete with them and then all of a

510
00:29:34.321 --> 00:29:39.060
sudden one homophobic joke.
Different game.
One homophobic.
Joking.

511
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:44.320
Oh,
it isn't though.
It's the same level of tenacity.
No,

512
00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:46.690
it is not.
It's a slower day.
Craig,

513
00:29:46.691 --> 00:29:50.020
if you're going to try and tell me that roller hockey is slower than ice hockey,

514
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:52.780
I'm going to end this podcast right now.
That's an easy,

515
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:55.870
if you're going to give me that,
I'm going to,
I'm going to run with that all day.

516
00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:01.300
You play hockey,
right?
Man,
I'm the only guy I ever met.

517
00:30:01.690 --> 00:30:05.470
I'm the only guy I ever met.
You played a high school?
Yeah,

518
00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:07.860
I played high school hockey.
And uh,
how would,

519
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:11.590
how would you describe your game average below average?
I started kind of late,

520
00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:14.930
but were you,
uh,
was there a main street t game?
No,

521
00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:20.320
I'd definitely like to,
I liked to,
uh,
play physical.

522
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:22.480
You Physical Guy?
I would.
I would,
I would,

523
00:30:23.650 --> 00:30:27.820
I would get the crap knocked out of me,
but I would also,
I would also,

524
00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:32.470
well,
you're not a small guy where you just said your wiring back then here,

525
00:30:32.890 --> 00:30:35.110
you know,
I wasn't,
do you have a temper?

526
00:30:35.230 --> 00:30:37.090
Did your ears turn red when somebody checked you?

527
00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:42.420
Like what half we wanted to hurt somebody if you know it was full of full

528
00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:46.120
contact.
Hockey is the best.
I just haven't played in a long time.

529
00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:49.450
What's the warrants shoulder pads in 20 years,
what's the best you ever got?

530
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:51.610
Somebody?
Oh my God.

531
00:30:51.611 --> 00:30:54.490
I don't know if you see somebody coming across the middle with their head down.

532
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:59.050
I mean you can really,
did they have to leave the ice?
Uh,

533
00:30:59.051 --> 00:31:03.580
I don't think I ever heard anybody.
Um,
do you feel bad at all?
No,

534
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:08.410
I did not ever hurt anybody.
No.
I never felt bad.
No.
Never ever,
ever.
I,
that was,

535
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:11.770
that's like illegal in hockey.
Like if you actually feel bad,
yeah,
you can't,

536
00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:15.510
it's not for you.
They make you walk out.
That's when you put your own jobs.

537
00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.480
That's you at your rollerblades

538
00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.190
start taking wide turns out there.
Hey,

539
00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:27.540
let me tell you something.
I'd like to see somebody set up those cones away.

540
00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.030
Those kids do in the park and do those little fucking backwards.

541
00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:33.540
A little s turns.
Yeah,
go get some.

542
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:36.940
Go get them his kids sounds kits.
Yeah,
put it on your little booty shorts.

543
00:31:36.941 --> 00:31:39.820
Come back down backwards.
I don't know.
I we started to,

544
00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:41.230
it was little more manly to roller blade.

545
00:31:41.290 --> 00:31:45.550
I mean it gets cause it's so acceptable to play ice hockey.
You know what I mean?

546
00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:48.810
I thought it took a real man.
Somebody who's really comfortable with themselves,

547
00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:51.250
comfortable to skate backwards in a park.

548
00:31:51.610 --> 00:31:54.640
You know with your short shorts on going around in and out of those fucking

549
00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:58.340
orange cones.
I had a little combs to,
didn't want to come speak to big.
No,
no,
no.

550
00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.750
You know you get the little cones cause,
cause otherwise people think,
you know,

551
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.750
maybe think more of you if you have a regular sized construction cone cause

552
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:10.390
you're getting even more difficult more.
Do you know what it was used for?

553
00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:14.680
Other things that could be confused for like real man activities.

554
00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:15.543
I know what it is.

555
00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:20.460
What it is is the cone would be so high and he had a hunch down that though your

556
00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:24.760
ball bag would be hitting him because your crotch stays right over the fucking

557
00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.830
coats.
Yeah,
cause you're so comfortable in who you are.
That's right.

558
00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:31.420
That's you're the kind of guy with a big low hanging ball sack that you might

559
00:32:31.421 --> 00:32:35.650
get that might nick,
one of those tall regular sized cones.

560
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.050
You got to have low cones.
You think it hurts to fall on the ice,

561
00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:40.160
fall on the asphalt.
Okay.
If

562
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:45.160
<v 2>you're man enough to rollerblade in the park with short cones and Spandex,</v>

563
00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:50.240
then you got a ball bag that hangs low enough for you to maybe protect

564
00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.320
<v 3>from what he's saying</v>

565
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:55.290
<v 2>from a taller cone.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm siding with the roller blade is here.</v>

566
00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.910
I'm agreement.
I'm just say I'm,
I'm not,

567
00:32:56.911 --> 00:33:00.360
I'm not arguing with your point that it takes a real man to go out in the park,

568
00:33:00.361 --> 00:33:04.620
set up cones and rolling.
Secure enough with yourself to,
you might never be bill.

569
00:33:04.621 --> 00:33:08.490
I'm not go roller.
I'm not gonna.
I'm not gonna lie.
I have limitations.

570
00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:11.970
I have limitations.
Hey,
I have to to promote,

571
00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:15.840
<v 3>uh,
something.
Aside from your album preferred customer,</v>

572
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:19.440
what are you selling this week,
Bill?
I'm selling F is for family.

573
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:24.810
Season three is coming out on Netflix on November 29th.

574
00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.110
Next month.
Um,

575
00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:32.640
it will be a joyous occasion and I think this is our strongest season.

576
00:33:32.641 --> 00:33:36.960
I'm talking a little shit here,
man.
All right.
You understand what I'm doing here.

577
00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:40.980
I'm saying that this is the best work we've done and I challenge you to watch

578
00:33:40.981 --> 00:33:42.210
all 10 episodes.

579
00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.400
So I get credit for the ratings before you decide.
Then I sneak.
Hey,

580
00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:50.160
here's something else.
You're on a,

581
00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:54.960
you're on a show maniac also on Netflix,
buddy by the great Jonah Hill.

582
00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.890
Huge fan of Jonah Hill.
You only like Jonah Hill when he,

583
00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:00.780
when he promotes something,
if someone gives him shit,

584
00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.550
he tells him to go fuck themselves.

585
00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.310
I don't know why more celebrities don't do that.

586
00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:09.090
There's always these little nitpick fucking cunty journalists coming at him.

587
00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:12.060
It's just like,
wow,
why don't you just say go fuck yourself?

588
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.920
He does not say he does it all the time.

589
00:34:16.921 --> 00:34:18.810
Not trying to like put it out there that he's like that,

590
00:34:18.811 --> 00:34:21.680
but there was some guy just,
he was harping on him about his fucking weight,

591
00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.700
knowing that he was sensitive about it.
You just said,
you know what?

592
00:34:23.701 --> 00:34:26.370
Fuck you fucking,
you just ah,
I wanted to,

593
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:30.930
I wanted to him to the punch that guy so bad,
you know,
take the lawsuit,

594
00:34:31.770 --> 00:34:35.100
take the little,
can't make them all honest.
Um,
and then there's another thing,

595
00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.750
a buddy of mine,
Johnny Hickey in a,

Nate,

How much time have we done here?

612
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:49.560
Your Vision's a little blurry because they crawled up inside you with a,

613
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:53.000
with a crank crank.
Wayne,
you know,
I would like,

614
00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:56.250
I would like to think that you'd have a little more fucking empathy for me.
Oh,

615
00:35:56.251 --> 00:35:59.610
Bill,
I'm just trying,
I'm trying to make excuses for your poor vision.

616
00:36:00.330 --> 00:36:03.060
Trying to remind everybody what you've been through.
What I've been through.

617
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:06.900
I'm the victim here.
Yeah.
Told you literally take a nap.

618
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.100
You wake up and the guy's like,

619
00:36:08.101 --> 00:36:12.600
you're all good and you all feel nothing.
You're all good.
It's,

620
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:15.990
they got it.
It's a cameras are getting smaller.

621
00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.660
The cameras are getting smaller and smaller every year.

622
00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:23.590
You know something that's actually a good point.
Like,
why didn't I,
yeah,
it's not,

623
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.170
it's good that you waited.
I waited till the cameras was small enough.

624
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:30.120
I'm doing the same thing with hair plugs.

625
00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:32.400
I'm just waiting till they just fucking,

626
00:36:32.401 --> 00:36:35.070
you just throw some fertilizer on your fucking head.

627
00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:39.180
I'm not doing this shit vacuum and stuff out and maybe,
or maybe not.

628
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:44.100
I'm waiting for when it's 100%.
What are they vacuum?
Well,

629
00:36:44.101 --> 00:36:48.450
they used to take like a slice out of the back.
They'd cut like a fucking,

630
00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.580
like a strip,
by the way.
Dude.
You have,

631
00:36:50.581 --> 00:36:52.950
you have the hair I had when I was in like fucking third grade.

632
00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:58.490

classic,
um,
and watch maniac,

634
00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:07.190
some of the Great Jonah Hill.
Jonah Hill,
Emma standed.

635
00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:11.040
Jonah Hill never tells anybody to go fuck themselves unless they deserve it.

636
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:14.460
It's,
that's right.
Oh,
I love Jonah Hill.
Um,

637
00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:18.360
Oscar nominated John Hill.
I heard him.
I know Howard stern today.

638
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.420
He's got some film coming out too that I'm going to go see.
Yeah,

639
00:37:21.421 --> 00:37:25.650
the eighties or something.
No,
it's about the nineties.
the 90s.
Yeah,

640
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.830

yeah,
I'm going to see that too.
Um,
anyways,

641
00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.190
so I got to do what they used to cut a fucking strip out of the back of your

642
00:37:32.191 --> 00:37:36.300
head.
Right.
And then they'd,
it was fucking creepy.
Then they take that,

643
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:38.130
then they'd sell your head back together.

644
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:41.880
They take like an eighth of an inch out and then somehow strip.
Yeah,

645
00:37:41.881 --> 00:37:45.330
just that strip they were able to see you like how are you getting,

646
00:37:45.770 --> 00:37:48.540
there's not enough like that hair only covered that amount of your head.

647
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:51.450
This is going to cover the whole top of your head.
I don't know how they did it.

648
00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.960
It's kind of like when they see the room fat,

649
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.320
he's tricking the rest of your scalp and the growing hair.
Well these,

650
00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.110
the ones in the back,
I guess they're good for life.
I don't get it.

651
00:38:01.111 --> 00:38:02.790
But like as far as I look at it,

652
00:38:03.450 --> 00:38:08.400
it's like now you're sticking it into the fucking no man's land.
The DMZ.
Right.

653
00:38:08.401 --> 00:38:13.350
Like,

I feel like back here is like,

654
00:38:13.351 --> 00:38:13.621

the Great Joe Rogan.
Yeah,

663
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:49.690
He actually is a very,
very well read guy.

664
00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:52.150
Like he really does research and I'm lazy,

You'd have to learn how to speak again if you lived it is fucking ridiculous.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:19.510
Okay.

Sure.
He,

He uses the whole thing.

681
00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:52.571
No,
and then the,

682
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:56.770
also the fact that that's as far as like having the best guy fight the best guy,

683
00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:59.530
best woman fight.
The best woman is far is,

684
00:39:59.590 --> 00:40:02.650
is that goes that m m m m.
A.
H.

685
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:07.680
That's what I feel is what killed boxing was just those guys duck and people for

686
00:40:08.741 --> 00:40:10.630
years and years and years.
And then it's like his,

687
00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:14.230
this is the IBF heavyweight champion.
This is the WBC is the WBA.

688
00:40:14.231 --> 00:40:17.710
Like back in the day when I was a kid,
there was one world champion.

689
00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:19.870
And you had to beat that fucking guy to win.

690
00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:23.410
They weren't like three of them and then somebody is trying to unify the fucking

691
00:40:23.411 --> 00:40:27.590
title.
They became like those fucking superhero movies like after awhile.

692
00:40:27.670 --> 00:40:31.030
It's just like I did.
These two guys exist at the same time.

693
00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.780
How are they driving down the street together?
Who's a good guy?
He's a bad guy,

694
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:36.900
right?
I don't know.
I never really watched the superhero.

695
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:41.510
I'll still watch boxing now.
I don't know why I still,
I love boxing,
but it's,

696
00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.710
it is obnoxious that they can somehow,

697
00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:46.710
can you imagine if if,

698
00:40:46.740 --> 00:40:51.190
if Mayweather and Pacquiao fought when they should have fought and they just had

699
00:40:51.191 --> 00:40:56.191
fucking two or three classics may whether woulda knocked him out three times,

700
00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:01.930
not.
Do you think he had that power?
Yeah.
Okay.
I don't mind.

701
00:41:01.931 --> 00:41:04.690
I don't know enough about it.
I don't either,
but I'm out of my wheelhouse

702
00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:11.640
aside from early Tyson and maybe Roy Jones for a year or two.

703
00:41:13.090 --> 00:41:16.210
He's the best box or I've ever watched.
I mean,
yeah,
you can't hit the guy.

704
00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:21.250
He can't hit the guy and his left that left comes just real heavy.
Yeah.

705
00:41:21.251 --> 00:41:24.250
I think he would have knocked out my Manny Pacquiao a couple times for sure.

706
00:41:24.251 --> 00:41:25.450
If they had a fight.
Well we ain't.

707
00:41:25.451 --> 00:41:30.250
They should father [inaudible] how do you think he would have done?
Was he like,

708
00:41:30.251 --> 00:41:34.150
was he in middle middleweight?
What was he?
I don't know.
Well,

709
00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:39.160
if he was in that division with Hagler,
Hearns,

710
00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.220
Leonard and Duran and all of them took a loss because all four of those guys

711
00:41:42.221 --> 00:41:45.100
were around at the same time.
Now I don't know enough about boxing,

712
00:41:45.430 --> 00:41:47.920
like I'm going to go out on a limb here and say there wasn't that level of

713
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.010
talent is division.
So taking that guy back in time,

714
00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:55.680
because I had his big argument one time with Versie about this,
where he verse,

715
00:41:55.681 --> 00:41:57.790
he said he would have beat all four of those guys.
I'm like,

716
00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:01.180
all four of those guys couldn't even beat each other.

717
00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:05.080
How much weight does he have on this way?
I wish I knew the way class.
Well,

718
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:06.550
let's just say they were the same way class.

719
00:42:06.551 --> 00:42:10.240
The big thing with Tommy Hearns was he was so fucking tall and could make that

720
00:42:10.241 --> 00:42:11.710
weight.
He was like six feet

721
00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:14.990
<v 2>total wine.
No,
I think what may,
whether it be any of those guys,</v>

722
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:19.991
because the difference in from now and then is significant in the training and

723
00:42:21.711 --> 00:42:22.280
the Diet.

724
00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:23.630
<v 1>No,
no,
no,
no,
but that's not a fair thing.</v>

725
00:42:23.631 --> 00:42:26.720
I'm saying if everybody had the same training the same day they came up in the

726
00:42:26.721 --> 00:42:27.554
same era.

727
00:42:28.130 --> 00:42:31.280
<v 2>I Dunno.
I didn't watch,
I didn't watch enough any of them,
but I,
but I,</v>

728
00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:35.500
I think that a Floyd Mayweather definitely could,

729
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:37.650
could bang and stand up

730
00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.200
<v 1>guy an antique.
It would be good against any of them.
I just don't know.</v>

731
00:42:40.201 --> 00:42:41.034
If you go for now

732
00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:44.750
<v 2>foreign,
Oh yeah,
that's tough.
But they should be fighting all of any,
yeah.</v>

733
00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:49.700
There should be no cupcake fights.
Get back to hair plugs.
I don't,

734
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.720
I still can't wrap my head around how some hair follicles are going to trick the

735
00:42:53.721 --> 00:42:55.640
other hair follicles and grown more here.

736
00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.990
<v 1>No,
no,
no.
These ones are just like,
okay,
these ones up here are sensitive.</v>

737
00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.760
Right.
That's why it's like these ones back here were raised right.

738
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:09.780
Like their parents didn't just,
if they fell down they said rub some dirt on it.

739
00:43:09.810 --> 00:43:12.450
They just,
these ones up here were,
I dunno.

740
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:14.970
I dunno what hat by just everything was not there.

741
00:43:15.170 --> 00:43:17.340
Like the teacher said the kid was a fucking asshole.

742
00:43:17.610 --> 00:43:20.400
The parents blame the teacher rather than looking at the kid.
Those,

743
00:43:20.401 --> 00:43:22.140
those are the,
that's that hair on top he had.

744
00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:27.090
So evidently something that I breezed by quickly on the Internet was claiming

745
00:43:27.091 --> 00:43:30.510
that stem cell is close to whatever you're going to go shoot this shit at the

746
00:43:30.511 --> 00:43:33.390
top and I'll have fucking hair like yours.
Of course.
You know my color though,

747
00:43:33.391 --> 00:43:37.110
right.
So I was joking with my listeners that I am doing this,

748
00:43:37.111 --> 00:43:39.300
I haven't quite announced yet cause we want to announce all the dates.

749
00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.370
I have this east,
east Germany,
east Germany,

750
00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:43.680
eastern European tour coming up in January.

751
00:43:44.970 --> 00:43:48.610
And I was saying I'm going to find some Transylvanian doctor and they're going

752
00:43:48.690 --> 00:43:50.130
to fucking shoot my head up.
Right.

753
00:43:50.131 --> 00:43:53.850
And I'm going to be over there long enough and I'm going to come back with like,

754
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:59.100
like a Farrah Fawcett haircut,
full ginger,
lack Transylvania now

755
00:44:01.370 --> 00:44:05.280
with my yellow eyebrows and my fucking freckles.
Yeah.

756
00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.840
I'm going to come back looking like Jaclyn Smith,
the Reddit,

757
00:44:09.841 --> 00:44:14.250
a male version of that,
but jet black hair that said it's going to be,

758
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.010
it's going to be,
and you know,
it's,
I'm going to tell you Nate,

759
00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:19.410
it's going to be weird and it's going to affect our friendship,

760
00:44:19.411 --> 00:44:22.920
but I really only think for about three weeks and you're just accept it because

761
00:44:22.921 --> 00:44:26.910
I'll still be me.
I'll still be me.
I'll still be telling the same jokes.

762
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.100
I'll still smoke a cigar with,
you know,
it could change it.

763
00:44:29.140 --> 00:44:33.990
You're just going to have,
can change your bill.
In what way?
I don't know.

764
00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:38.670
You know,
send me a full,
full,
beautiful head of flowing black hair.

765
00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:43.890
I'll send,
I get a convertible,
I'll get one of those things.
Like those firsts.
No,

766
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:47.610
those old willys jeeps right where you can put the windshield down so I can just

767
00:44:47.611 --> 00:44:51.090
have the hair blowing the whole fucking time.
Well,

768
00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:54.880
she see burst hair.
He's not sleeping.
He's driving a hearse now

769
00:44:56.590 --> 00:45:00.660
on the vampire route.
Yeah.
And be fucking all will be all gray.

770
00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.700
Be like that.
I'll look like a lost boy.
I'll be a redheaded fucking lost boy.

771
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:08.160
I got to learn how to say that in,
in Czechoslovakia.

772
00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:12.450
When I walked into the head doctor
and he asked me,

773
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:15.540
how can I help you?
All right.
I'm just going to be,
I want to,

774
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:18.110
I want to look like a fucking,
what did I do?

775
00:45:18.330 --> 00:45:22.740
A redheaded lost boy make me look like I've been here for thousands of years.

776
00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:26.370
I don't want that.
Look.
I know what that look,
dude,

777
00:45:26.371 --> 00:45:28.650
if I did that and then I started botox,

778
00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:34.020
do you realize the roles that would open?
I'd have the shiny frozen face,

779
00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.650
right?
You'd have to start working at a casino.

780
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:43.140
You'd have to sign a contract at a casino.
Oh No,
I don't want to go that route.

781
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:48.510
Um,
anyways,
so I guess,
I guess I'm going to game format fun.

782
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:53.270
I'm psyched.
Oh by the way,
the all things comedy,
uh,
podcast,
uh,

783
00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:57.090
festival is this weekend out there in Arizona.
Want to thank everybody?

784
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:00.240
I think it starts up tonight.
I'm Paul Versey is out there.

785
00:46:00.241 --> 00:46:04.770
I'm going to be there tomorrow doing a live podcast.
Live.
I live.
I do this shit.

786
00:46:04.771 --> 00:46:06.480
Talking to myself,
live in front of a crowd.

787
00:46:06.481 --> 00:46:10.560
I've only done it one other time and I did it in a,
hey,

788
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:15.090
maybe I'll talk about getting my colonoscopy.
Where are you going to do this?
Um,

789
00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:19.740
and uh,
what's that?
What's that comedy club there and fucking laughs.

790
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:24.250
What's the,
what's the one there?
Yuk yuks stand up live in Phoenix knee.

791
00:46:24.251 --> 00:46:28.080
Slappers and Phoenix.
What's it called?
Not the Tempe Improv.

792
00:46:28.081 --> 00:46:30.440
Stand up library and that stand up light.
There you go.
Yep.

793
00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:37.320
That gut busters.
Good posters.
What's it called?
They're a funny bone.

794
00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:39.420
Um,
yeah,

795
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.540
I'm going to be doing that and then we'll be doing a standup show after that.
So,

796
00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.840
uh,
NLS,
we'll be doing the goddamn comedy jam.
So I,
I have,

797
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:50.840
I have to fucking learn how to play a fucking song by then,
man.
Goddamn,
Goddamn.

798
00:46:50.970 --> 00:46:55.020
I do.
I got to get them changes down,
man.
Everybody knows,
man.

799
00:46:55.021 --> 00:46:57.660
When you're the drummer,
you can fuck up as it guitars.

800
00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:59.430
You can fuck up on that fit along,

801
00:47:01.830 --> 00:47:05.880
but you fuck up as a drummer.
Everybody knows it.
Even they don't know it was you.

802
00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:06.990
They know something happened.

803
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:11.910
I'm the only guy I ever met come learn a fucking song on a fucking southwest

804
00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.480
flat fucking Phoenix,
Arizona.
50 minutes.

805
00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.420
I'm only guy I ever met took,

806
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:21.420
took drum lessons on a pontoon boat.

807
00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:25.530
I'm the only guy I've met made drum sticks out of a platypus.

808
00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:30.070
I'm only guy I ever makes his

809
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:30.440
<v 2>own</v>

810
00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:34.720
<v 1>possum bacon.
You can actually bake,
right?
You can actually cook.
Yeah.</v>

811
00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:39.890
I mean it's limited.
My game was through down.
You came to the rose one year.

812
00:47:39.891 --> 00:47:41.570
I thought you,
I thought you threw down.
You made something.

813
00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:42.620
Did you send me a picture?

814
00:47:44.640 --> 00:47:47.840
<v 2>No,
I've been to your tailgate twice.
I didn't,
I,</v>

815
00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.690
I freeloaded both times.
Free loaded my ass off.

816
00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:56.580
Were you here when I fell for like 45 SAS?
I was right there.
That was perfect.

817
00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:01.070
Uh,
sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry.
Yeah.

818
00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:05.820
You wrapped around.
I was losing my balance.
Standing Tent Pole.

819
00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:11.070
You try to hold on to like,
you try to hold onto like a foldout tent.

820
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.180
Like it was like a pillar at like a,
like a shelter.
Oh yeah.

821
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:18.390
That aluminum thing that you tried to balance on something that

822
00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:22.920
<v 1>was 15 pounds tops.
I says,
sorry,</v>

823
00:48:22.921 --> 00:48:25.260
like 19 times in a row before I finally went down.

824
00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.720
<v 2>Somehow the things stayed in one place and you kind of wrapped around it.</v>

825
00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:34.190
You fell over a cooler and then slept in a folding

826
00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:38.230
<v 1>chair for about two hours every year.
I do the power nap.</v>

827
00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:41.800
I knew the power nap.
I remember one year being so hammered that thing,

828
00:48:42.190 --> 00:48:46.240
I was smoking my Cuban cigar before law headed,

829
00:48:46.650 --> 00:48:50.600
finished the entree salads and people were just,
I mean I was

830
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.290
<v 2>mess.
People were taking all,</v>

831
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:56.500
they will walk and by Rangers were taking pictures with you like you were like a

832
00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.570
,
like a Marlin hanging.

833
00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:59.930
<v 1>They didn't want to go near me.
They didn't want to go near me.
I,</v>

834
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:05.080
I remember looking up at some mothers going by with children just and I,

835
00:49:05.451 --> 00:49:08.660
and I,
I didn't understand.
I thought they used to be looking at me with disgust,

836
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:12.140
but now that I am a parent,
I know what that look was.
That was,

837
00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:15.350
that was actually how do I prevent my children from doing that,

838
00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:19.520
from becoming that because whoever their parents are,

839
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:23.030
they failed completely.
Um,

840
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:27.950
I'm only guy I ever met,
got fans in my sleep.
That's a good one.

841
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.340
That's some shit talk.
I'm the old guy I haven't met.
Can't read out loud.
Does it?

842
00:49:31.341 --> 00:49:34.790
Every fucking weekend.
His podcast I got to do fucking,
uh,

843
00:49:35.350 --> 00:49:39.770
I got to do some fucking,
I got to read some shit here.
What'd you say?

844
00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:44.630
Season three.
November 29th.
November 29 season three.
Yeah.
It was for family,

845
00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:45.150
booboo,

846
00:49:45.150 --> 00:49:50.150
booboo barrier where they are doody or do you do come and watch this shit.

847
00:49:51.370 --> 00:49:55.860
Season three.
All right.
Oh,
hey,
here we go.
Um,
you like advertising,
right?
Nathan?

848
00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:59.570
Love it.
All right,
here we go.
By the way,
November 29th I'll be at Zane.

849
00:49:59.571 --> 00:50:03.840
He's in Saint Charles.
Oh,
you will say,
well,
I remember that run.
Is that the one?

850
00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.420
When is that?
When you start,
uh,
you start downtown and then you,

851
00:50:08.610 --> 00:50:11.720
did you do Saint Charles and then Mount Vernon or something?
That one's close,

852
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:14.990
but the Saint Charles [inaudible] is still open.
I'll be there at 29th,

853
00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:17.160
which was that Illuminati legs sort of like,

854
00:50:17.180 --> 00:50:20.180
first it was like this sort of the middle of nowhere.

855
00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:25.550
Like giant ranch stats.
Pheasant run.
That's the Saint Charles.
Yeah,

856
00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:28.280
it's the reserve.
The rest of the,
it's like a quarter walk to the venue

857
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:30.700
<v 5>and you never go outside.
Yeah.
You never go outside.</v>

858
00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:33.780
So it's a real Midwest casino experience.
I love it.
All right.

859
00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:39.200
Does everybody hymns?
It wasn't us.
It was hymns.
Here's a problem.
Oh,
look at this.

860
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:43.760
66% of men lose their hair by age 35.
Look at that,
Nate.

861
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:46.820
You're in the top fucking 34% thing is,

862
00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
is when you start to notice hair loss.
It's too late.

863
00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.690
It's easier to keep the hair you have than to replace the hair you've lost.

864
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:58.760
Is that hairline slowly starting to move backwards?
Any bald spots yet.

865
00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:03.110
How will you feel a year from now if it's business as usual up there?

866
00:51:04.100 --> 00:51:09.100
Why do guys turn to weird solution or do nothing when they can turn to the

867
00:51:10.431 --> 00:51:11.264
medicine?

868
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:15.590
I was getting slightly offended at this and we can turn a medicine and science.

869
00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:16.131
Uh,

870
00:51:16.131 --> 00:51:21.131
what hymns does is connect you with real doctors and medical grade solutions to

871
00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:23.750
treat hair loss,
well known generic equivalents.

872
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:27.380
To name brand prescriptions to help you keep your hair.

873
00:51:27.530 --> 00:51:30.770
No snake oil pills or gas station.
Counter supplements.

874
00:51:31.070 --> 00:51:34.610
Prescription solutions backed by science.
No waiting room.

875
00:51:34.611 --> 00:51:36.170
No awkward doctor visits.

876

Organic organic chickens and heritage bread.

925
00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:50.340
Now like you,
you're probably like me.

926
00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:53.970
You'll probably ask me what is heritage bread?
Pork.
This is exactly what I was

927
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.720
<v 3>was asking.
You know what the fuck this is?</v>

928
00:54:56.410 --> 00:55:00.910
Evidently these are pigs.
Pure pigs.

929
00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.870
All right,
that you can trace the bloodline back to Europe.

930
00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.210
These were the original snooty pics.

931
00:55:07.570 --> 00:55:10.780
Now like these filthy once that are all fucking mixed here.

932
00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:14.560
This is like sort of like the Klan meats,

933

<v 1>I'm only guy I ever met each royal bacon.

936
00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:29.350
it was the greatest fucking pork chop other than I went to a gourmet restaurant

937
00:55:29.351 --> 00:55:30.490
and they really knew what they were doing.

938
00:55:30.491 --> 00:55:34.330
But I'm a comedian and I cook this thing and this thing fucked with that pork

939
00:55:34.331 --> 00:55:37.180
chop.
All right.
Butcher box.
Yes.

940
00:55:37.210 --> 00:55:39.190
The incredible quality of butcher box meets,

941
00:55:39.191 --> 00:55:44.191
start with the commitment to raising animals humanely and free of antibiotics

942
00:55:44.230 --> 00:55:47.280
and hormones before they murder them.
All right?

943
00:55:47.290 --> 00:55:50.110
Each box comes with at least nine to 11 pounds of meat,

944
00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:53.410
which is enough for 24 individual size meals.

945
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:56.170
Unless you're a fat binge eating fuck,

946
00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:59.710
then you probably just stick your face in it and eat fucking Ramy.

947
00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:03.640
Please try to cook the chicken to all the fatties out there.

but I am.
I am a big,

965
00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:10.710
big fucking a pork chop guy.
Uh,

966
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:15.370
to guess what the fucking Terminex guy's come and I got termites in my house.

967
00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:17.710
You got to get a tent put up.
I got it.

968
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:21.910
I got to get a tent that I can slowly fall around for 45 seconds is I say sorry

969
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:25.060
and sorry.
So lets,
lets fucking wrap this up here.
Nate,

970
00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:28.600
you one of my favorite people in this fucking business.
You really are buddy.

971
00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:30.280
You really?
Yeah.
You were raised right.

972
00:57:30.970 --> 00:57:34.840
You know your dad made you refinish that fucking basement right yet to get on

973
00:57:34.841 --> 00:57:37.750
your hands and knees and scrub it.
He said the floor wasn't clean enough.

974
00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:42.490
Wire brush.
Why are fucking brush it would again do it again.
Came downstairs.

975
00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:45.010
Yep.
Scrape the house and it's right.
Yup.

976
00:57:45.070 --> 00:57:47.530
You were down there crying and saying how much you hated your dad and he didn't

977
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:48.540
let you back up to your fucking

978
00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:53.120
<v 1>good.
Finished it.
Right.
He's a beautiful man.
He is but I'm just saying real,</v>

979
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:57.290
real Mister Miyagi treatment.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Wax On.
Wax Off.

980
00:57:58.310 --> 00:58:03.170
You have a CD out.
It is called preferred customer.
It's available on iTunes.

981
00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.040
I'm going to download it because I support you and everything that you do and a,

982
00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:11.090
and my wife loves you.
You know,
usually she's like,

983
00:58:11.091 --> 00:58:14.600
take those animals out back you.
She actually,
let's in the house

984
00:58:16.550 --> 00:58:18.460
here@natecraig.com.
We love the burst.
All right.
Um,

985
00:58:18.490 --> 00:58:20.740
and with that maniac on Netflix,

986
00:58:20.741 --> 00:58:24.180
I'll be at a go bananas in Cincinnati February 7th through the

987
00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.900
<v 3>10th.
You got it.
Um,
let's see here.
And then,
um,</v>

988
00:58:27.930 --> 00:58:32.620
before we go to the throwback,
we got,
um,
I,

989
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:36.630
I called into the sports gambling podcast with Shawn Green love shrine.

990
00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:39.300
Ryan Kramer.
These guys know their shit and I'm just showing green.

991
00:58:39.301 --> 00:58:44.220
I'm just the dope on the show.
Um,
you can listen to my picks for the week.

992
00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:47.730
I'm getting more and more house wifey,
like New Orleans versus the Vikings.
Well,

993
00:58:47.731 --> 00:58:51.990
I love Bourbon Street,
so,
and I love drew Brees.
I just think he's a family man.

994
00:58:51.991 --> 00:58:56.991
I'm taking the saints and then we'll have a bonus half hour of a greatest hits

995
00:58:57.691 --> 00:59:00.330
Thursday afternoon,
just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.

996
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.070
Have a great weekend.
You can

997
00:59:07.960 --> 00:59:08.793
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

998
00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:13.540
<v 3>Whoa,
go pray my shotgun.</v>

999
00:59:19.910 --> 00:59:22.220
Oh,
ain't going start shooting

1000
00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:23.593
<v 7>again.</v>

1001
00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.700
Go Brang me my shot gun.

1002
00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:39.690
You know,
I just got to start shooting again.

1003
00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:50.790
You know,
I'm gonna shoot my woman.

1004
00:59:53.970 --> 00:59:56.960
Oh is she fooling around with two mini me?

1005
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:04.280
<v 8>Bill Burr on the sports gambling podcast is brought to you by my book G.</v>

1009
01:00:15.901 --> 01:00:20.100
courtesy of my bookie Dad Agee Promo Code Bill Bets,
the one and only bill burr.

1010
01:00:20.101 --> 01:00:24.570
Bill,
appreciate you calling in and we,
we got you away from the game.
Currently,

1011
01:00:24.571 --> 01:00:28.260
right now we're taping during a world series game one right now.

1012
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:30.600
The sacs are up five to three.

1013
01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.050
<v 9>How are you feeling?
You don't have me away.</v>

1014
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.070
I'm the guy who never feels confident about his team.

1015
01:00:37.071 --> 01:00:41.330
I feel like the Dodgers had been in the last couple of years and haven't been

1016
01:00:41.331 --> 01:00:44.770
able to get it done.
So they got a lot of experience and all of that.
But uh,

1017
01:00:44.771 --> 01:00:47.990
I'm hoping,
you know,
we can come out with a victory here tonight.

1018
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.320
You know the usual stuff.
Bill Belicheck I've learned you don't talk trash,

1019
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:53.330
no bulletin board material.

1020
01:00:53.910 --> 01:00:56.580
<v 8>That was always a,
I love that he,
uh,</v>

1021
01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:01.560
who is it the patriots receiver that made all those Rex Ryan for choker.
Yeah,

1022
01:01:01.561 --> 01:01:06.210
Wes Welker in that press conference where he just kept calling out the rex Ryan

1023
01:01:06.211 --> 01:01:10.320
foot fetish video and then Belicheck had to lay the hammer on him and drop him

1024
01:01:10.321 --> 01:01:12.510
for a,
I think he made them sit the first quarter.

1025
01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.700
<v 9>Yeah,
we lost that game against the jets.</v>

1026
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:19.580
<v 8>Plus it makes you wonder what,
uh,</v>

1027
01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:22.640
Malcolm Butler did before the Superbowl as far as like,

1028
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:25.620
what are you got to do to get sat for the Superbowl?
But I,

1029
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:26.750
I guess we'll never find that.

1030
01:01:27.460 --> 01:01:27.941
<v 9>No,</v>

1031
01:01:27.941 --> 01:01:31.630
I think what you're going to have to do is years later you got to be on a golf

1032
01:01:31.631 --> 01:01:36.370
course with some,
uh,
old time patriots or whatever.
Someone,
some of,

1033
01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:37.840
we'll have a couple too many cores,

1034
01:01:37.841 --> 01:01:42.100
lights and someone will tell you what happened eventually.
Yeah.
I liked that.

1035
01:01:42.101 --> 01:01:43.390
They've kept it in house.
So

1036
01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:47.900
<v 8>yeah,
he had Belicheck actually did the intro to the world series.</v>

1037
01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.280
I don't know if you caught that.
Uh,

1038
01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:53.500
up top he did the voiceover for kind of like the hype video leading into a

1039
01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:58.030
writing voice,
which he's an amazing coach,
but his,

1040
01:01:58.031 --> 01:02:00.080
his voice over work kind of monotone there.

1041
01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.270
<v 9>I think it's just muscle memory at this point.
Everybody,</v>

1042
01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:09.150
everybody who's like on the team says he's actually a funny guy,
but you know,

1043
01:02:09.190 --> 01:02:11.440
he's just smart.
Like that's,
that's scrapped it.

1044
01:02:11.441 --> 01:02:15.730
Those guys were doing that guy in the Astros who showed a them lighten up.

1045
01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:20.430
Was it price or something?
I forget who.
I forget who that was wasn't priced but,

1046
01:02:20.580 --> 01:02:23.700
but it was just so,
you know,
when they went back to back to back against them.

1047
01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:26.280
So just looking at some game film,
it's just like,

1048
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:30.480
why would you do anything to amp up the other pro?

1049
01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.960
Because the second you get pissed you're not scared anymore.
It's like,

1050
01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:37.410
let him sit there in silence and think about,

1051
01:02:37.411 --> 01:02:41.820
I hope I don't screw this up.
You know,
instead you get them all motivated.

1052
01:02:42.030 --> 01:02:43.280
It's dumb,
dumb move.

1053
01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.270
<v 8>It's the most obvious like same tactic in sport.
Just don't talk,</v>

1054
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:50.120
just don't speak everyone.
Everyone gives Belcher crap up.

1055
01:02:50.121 --> 01:02:54.110
What should he say to the media?
Should he tip his hand as a,
as a fan,

1056
01:02:54.111 --> 01:02:56.600
you don't want them giving away any the slightest thing,

1057
01:02:56.900 --> 01:03:00.800
either motivation or strategy wise.
Why would you ever say anything?
And Sean,

1058
01:03:00.801 --> 01:03:02.210
you know,
you know,

1059
01:03:02.211 --> 01:03:06.380
he probably got into it when he was a younger man because for Lawrence Taylor to

1060
01:03:06.381 --> 01:03:06.981
respect bill,

1061
01:03:06.981 --> 01:03:10.250
it's bill a check on the level that Lawrence Taylor respects bill Belichick.

1062
01:03:10.670 --> 01:03:14.900
He's seen some shit,
right?
Lt got after it pretty hard there.

1063
01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:18.440
<v 9>Yeah.
I think,
I think,
uh,
you know,</v>

1064
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:23.110
I have to reason the media hates us is because we,

1065
01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.720
we always win and the other half is because bill Belicheck makes him so

1066
01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:31.040
difficult to do their job.
They like,
like they loved Rex Ryan.

1067
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.780
Rex Ryan was a quote machine and it's just like,
he just gave him easy days.

1068
01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:39.200
He just,
Hey,
I'm not going up there to kiss his rings.
You know,

1069
01:03:39.201 --> 01:03:41.900
we're going to win the Superbowl.
He was like it.
Rex Ryan,

1070
01:03:41.950 --> 01:03:44.200
it was like interview when a wrestler during a Promo,
right?

1071
01:03:44.410 --> 01:03:47.570
<v 8>No,
it's cutting a pro.
He was the heel Trump.
I mean if they,</v>

1072
01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.470
rex Ryan is the football equivalent of Trump.
Exactly.
Yeah.

1073
01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:54.310
<v 9>The article writes itself and Bill Belicheck.
It's just like,
Oh man,</v>

1074
01:03:54.311 --> 01:03:57.940
I get now I actually have to watch the game and come up with something smart to

1075
01:03:57.941 --> 01:03:59.130
say,
you know,

1076
01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:03.040
some sort of analogy rather than just building it around the crazy thing or our

1077
01:04:03.041 --> 01:04:03.874
coach said,

1078
01:04:04.090 --> 01:04:07.660
<v 8>yeah,
breaks.
Ryan made everyone's job easier.
All right bill,</v>

1079
01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.960
let's happen with some of these spreads.
Moving over to the NFL,

1080
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:12.820
kicking things off lines.

1081
01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:17.320
Courtesy again from my bookie dad Agee big game here in New Orleans,

1082
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:20.740
head into Minnesota right now.
The Minnesota Vikings.

1083
01:04:20.741 --> 01:04:24.550
A one point favorite at home.
Which way you lean in here.

1084
01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:30.410
<v 9>I love drew Brees and I love New Orleans and I like to drink [inaudible] call</v>

1085
01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:31.914
with New Orleans

1086
01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:35.810
<v 8>solid combo.
You can't,
you can't beat that Combo.
Yeah.</v>

1087
01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.280
<v 9>Yes.
They opt to stay off of Bourbon Street.</v>

1088
01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:41.570
I got some places you can y'all ego with the local go.

1089
01:04:43.290 --> 01:04:46.710
You don't go to a purpose street.
That's The Times Square of New Orleans.

1090
01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.510
<v 8>You had it.
Hey,</v>

1091
01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:50.890
hang out with video and need some chicken on a stick and a gas station,
Shawn.

1092
01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:55.580
Yeah.
This is,
I mean,
there's a huge revenge angle here,
right?

1093
01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:57.001
Oh yeah.
I mean,

1094
01:04:57.001 --> 01:05:01.310
New Orleans coming in after what happened to knock them out of the playoffs,

1095
01:05:01.311 --> 01:05:06.050
that miracle in Minnesota,
the way they lost that game.
I mean,
they were,

1096
01:05:06.590 --> 01:05:09.230
obviously they should have won that game.
Total collapse.

1097
01:05:09.231 --> 01:05:12.950
New Orleans coming in on fire,
five and O in their last five.

1098
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:16.340
But more importantly for,
and one against the spread.
This New Orleans team,

1099
01:05:16.341 --> 01:05:19.270
I think if they gonna slip up,
it was,

1100
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:21.040
it was going to be against that ravens team.
Right.

1101
01:05:21.041 --> 01:05:23.080
But they played well hung in that game.

1102
01:05:23.081 --> 01:05:26.470
And this team just seems to it in the NFC right now,

1103
01:05:26.471 --> 01:05:28.760
it's just gotta be the saints or the rams.
Right?
I mean they,

1104
01:05:28.761 --> 01:05:32.290
they seem like they're really firing on all cylinders.
Yeah.

1105
01:05:32.291 --> 01:05:35.470
I'm going to play the regression angle.
Everyone's seeing the CTO and Vikings,

1106
01:05:35.910 --> 01:05:38.580
Vikings,
I'm,
I'm gonna.
I'm not gonna they're pros.

1107
01:05:38.650 --> 01:05:40.540
I don't think the revenge thing is real.

1108
01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:44.650
And I think this Minnesota defense has turned it up of late and uh,
yeah,

1109
01:05:44.651 --> 01:05:47.380
everyone's kind of forgotten about that sick home field advantage and I think

1110
01:05:47.381 --> 01:05:50.410
it's coming back so well.
New Orleans normally not go on the road,

1111
01:05:50.411 --> 01:05:54.250
but I mean it's another dome team.
I think this is a decent spot for him.
Yeah.

1112
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:55.670
All right to that.

1113
01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.730
<v 9>I actually,
I don't believe in that.
You know,
the,</v>

1114
01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.350
the grudge matches anymore unless it happened the same season with the lodge of

1115
01:06:04.351 --> 01:06:07.800
free agencies and how much everybody hangs out each of with each other in a

1116
01:06:07.801 --> 01:06:09.870
barbecue.
It's not the way it used to be.

1117
01:06:09.980 --> 01:06:11.890
<v 8>Yeah.
Everyone's,
you know,
hanging tag,</v>

1118
01:06:11.970 --> 01:06:14.690
you're tagging each other on the gram and shouting each other ad,

1119
01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.850
especially in the NBA,
the NBA,

1120
01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:19.970
it just feels like one big rec league where there's just,
okay,

1121
01:06:19.971 --> 01:06:23.300
there's one team that's clearly going to dominate and then everyone else is just

1122
01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.280
kind of having fun hanging out.

1123
01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:26.320
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1124
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:29.860
It's like a warehouse playing softball against each other and it's really just

1125
01:06:29.861 --> 01:06:31.900
about going out and having some beers,
you know?

1126
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:36.600
<v 8>Yeah.
They may as well turn the NBA into a beer league league at this point.
Uh,</v>

1127
01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:37.220
it's gotten

1128
01:06:37.220 --> 01:06:40.710
<v 9>crazy.
Nobody,
I mean,
what was the last thing you saw on Instagram?</v>

1129
01:06:40.711 --> 01:06:44.700
Video of a dunk where there was anybody seriously challenging somebody.

1130
01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.590
First of all,
you're not even allowed to be in the paint and all these kids know,

1131
01:06:48.810 --> 01:06:52.620
Oh man,
I'm going to be on the gram.
So they usually get your head taken off,

1132
01:06:52.950 --> 01:06:55.740
but not,
not you.
Just kidding.
I don't know.
It's just completely,

1133
01:06:55.741 --> 01:06:59.790
everything is completely different game.
Like,
uh,

1134
01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.820
did I talk to you guys about that Kansas City Patriots game?

1135
01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:06.610
<v 8>No,
I don't.
I don't think we talked about that,
but uh,
yeah,</v>

1136
01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:10.220
<v 9>that like that right there like that is not football.</v>

1137
01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:15.440
Like I that's like watching two people playing a video game with live people

1138
01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:18.320
like the fact that that number 10,
I always forget his name,

1139
01:07:18.321 --> 01:07:22.760
whatever his name is on cancers.
Tyreek hill,
he's killing you the whole game.

1140
01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:26.660
There's a minute or two minutes left,
you know,
that go to him.

1141
01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:29.960
Not only does he score,
he ran across the field,

1142
01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:34.250
he runs up the side like untouched for like 70 yards.

1143
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:39.310
I get the guys fast,
but no,
she just,
she just ran out there like it was,
you know,

1144
01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:42.110
the coach's son and there was something out to a,

1145
01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:47.060
nobody touched them on this play then.
It was like a,
make a wish,

1146
01:07:47.570 --> 01:07:48.470
a moment,

1147
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:53.380
<v 8>please let him run down.
Tired until,
as leukemia at juvenile diabetes.
Come on.</v>

1148
01:07:53.490 --> 01:07:55.680
And he's living out his dream.
And to the point of that,

1149
01:07:55.681 --> 01:08:00.660
how the leagues have gotten soft,
if anyone hasn't listened to Charles Oakley,

1150
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:05.070
discuss this on the Simmons podcast,
he really just keep calls.
He's like,
yeah,

1151
01:08:05.071 --> 01:08:07.380
it's a,
you know,
back in my day,
we just fought.
He's like,

1152
01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:10.200
when we said we were in a fight,
we fought nowadays,
who knows?

1153
01:08:10.201 --> 01:08:13.530
That doesn't mean much,
you know,
like it,
it,
it's,
it's odd.
I know.
Well,
and then,

1154
01:08:13.770 --> 01:08:17.410
uh,
and then Tyree hill got the beer poured on him by,
uh,

1155
01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.320
one of the pats fans and that was a disgrace.
That was a,

1156
01:08:20.350 --> 01:08:23.240
that was the whole big thing.
And it,
uh,
my buddy actually,

1157
01:08:23.241 --> 01:08:26.400
it kind of reminded me of the malice at the palace.
And,
uh,

1158
01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.650
my buddy actually sent me,

1159
01:08:27.651 --> 01:08:30.350
Bill has a great bit about it back in the day when it happened,

1160
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:34.670
about how awesome it was to just see a professional athlete go up into the

1161
01:08:34.671 --> 01:08:39.310
stands and beat the shit out of a shitty fan.
It's,
it's really as,
listen,

1162
01:08:39.330 --> 01:08:42.870
<v 9>we're walking the wrong guy.
That was the only thing that sucked was he got,</v>

1163
01:08:43.350 --> 01:08:45.940
he didn't get the rug that she knows something I liked.
Everybody was like,
Oh,

1164
01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.240
real classy patriots fans.
And everybody forgets that the Yankees,
you know,
uh,

1165
01:08:50.490 --> 01:08:51.660
through the,
uh,

1166
01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:56.530
through a beer in a relief pitcher this year when they call bad home run,
uh,

1167
01:08:56.670 --> 01:09:00.840
a fan of the,
and so whatever,
whatever the hell happened on that out that play.

1168
01:09:00.841 --> 01:09:04.920
I can't remember the New York capers with trash in the red sox and they made

1169
01:09:04.921 --> 01:09:08.310
that kid when the Yankees Played Baltimore way back in the day that he reached

1170
01:09:08.311 --> 01:09:12.780
over was a basket catch it.
They made that kid a local hero.

1171
01:09:13.130 --> 01:09:16.670
<v 8>Yeah.
Jay is definitely mayor.
Was that his name?
Uh,
and I,</v>

1172
01:09:16.671 --> 01:09:18.650
I would say this as a compliment to,

1173
01:09:18.890 --> 01:09:22.790
to red sox and even Eagles Fan Philadelphia fans.
There is that element of like,

1174
01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:26.000
yeah,
I grew up going to red sox,
Yankees fans and you know,

1175
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:29.300
I saw a dude like fall from love the middle deck to the lower deck.

1176
01:09:29.301 --> 01:09:33.230
Like do things got thrown.
Like that's part of the game.
Everything's just Yah.

1177
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.840
I mean I know out here it's about bringing knives to the game,

1178
01:09:35.841 --> 01:09:38.810
but there's a certain,
there's a certain beauty in like the,
the,

1179
01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:41.570
the flying here bottle,
simple beer toss

1180
01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:47.100
<v 9>and the most would be going to gain for the world series last year.
Awesome.</v>

1181
01:09:47.190 --> 01:09:50.530
As a red sox fan and I will be dressed like a undercover cop.

1182
01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:55.000
I will not have any red sox stuff on.
I just,
I don't still need it.

1183
01:09:55.001 --> 01:09:58.330
It's just out here.
It's just not fun.
Made that mistake

1184
01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:04.370
<v 8>I made,
I made,
I made that mistake one time.
Wore a don Mattingly who,</v>

1185
01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.150
you know,
most people,
most people say even if you hate the Yankees,

1186
01:10:08.151 --> 01:10:11.540
you like Donny baseball.
Where am my don Mattingly,

1187
01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:16.280
a Jersey to the bleachers.
The all you can eat bleachers that at Dodgers stadium,

1188
01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.770
multiple,
multiple food items thrown at me during the game.

1189
01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:26.660
You're going to a place where they have unlimited ammunition.
Ryan,
it was fun.

1190
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:32.270
<v 9>My favorite thing is when you literally get in threatened bodily harm and curse</v>

1191
01:10:32.591 --> 01:10:35.490
that and that and it's by some dude and he's there with like,

1192
01:10:35.730 --> 01:10:40.170
he has like three kids under the age of age.
Yes.

1193
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.500
Like what are you doing?
What are you teaching these?
These,
these kids.

1194
01:10:43.501 --> 01:10:45.300
You turning them into animals and it's just,

1195
01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.260
it's just how it is out here and it's straight across the board.

1196
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:53.070
Like it isn't like a,
I guess if you sit down in the bleachers,
it's,

1197
01:10:53.071 --> 01:10:57.810
I mean in the box seats it's a little bit nicer,
but it's just like,
I don't care.

1198
01:10:57.811 --> 01:11:02.160
Like you know,
black,
white,
Latino.
Yeah.
I don't chair.

1199
01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.370
It's just straight across the board.
These people out here,
we're just like,
no,

1200
01:11:05.371 --> 01:11:09.420
we're going to kill you.
It's like,
it's like,
all right,
well that was,

1201
01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:10.950
that was a fun first dating.

1202
01:11:10.951 --> 01:11:14.910
I guess I'll go down and get a hot dog and sort of meander around the stadium to

1203
01:11:14.911 --> 01:11:17.800
get away from you guys.
And I put my hat in my back pocket.
But

1204
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:18.763
<v 8>it's such a,</v>

1205
01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.430
it's such a weird dichotomy because you think of La and you don't think of like

1206
01:11:22.431 --> 01:11:24.800
passionate sports fans,
but then,
oh yeah,

1207
01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:29.210
we'll randomly murder you over a baseball game.
The weird,
weird,
weird.

1208
01:11:29.211 --> 01:11:32.420
We're building great stereotype.
I believe sports fans,
right?

1209
01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.660
<v 9>Casual.
Somebody in you need to be one.
I almost got into a fight.</v>

1210
01:11:36.661 --> 01:11:41.650
Security had to come up,
escort us out and it's a San Diego chargers game.
Uh,

1211
01:11:41.670 --> 01:11:46.340
almost got killed in a gun for threatened to be stabbed at an angel's game.
Wow.

1212
01:11:47.910 --> 01:11:50.780
By then I'd learned my lesson.
I'm like,
these people are like out of their mind.

1213
01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.470
Uh,
you know,
and then,
you know,
some Celtics Lakers crap.

1214
01:11:55.471 --> 01:11:59.400
I was a Celtics Jersey,
Paul Pierce Jersey in the upper deck.
Oh,

1215
01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:04.220
mad move bad move you Irish dish.
You Irish Stack Austin.

1216
01:12:04.230 --> 01:12:06.970
You chowder?
Hell yeah,
the whole damn thing.
It.

1217
01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:11.070
By the time I went to a Raiders patriots game,
I was just like,

1218
01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.200
I'm just going to wear a black tee shirt.
And uh,
you know,
like,
uh,
I dunno,
uh,

1219
01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.190
ll bean hat or something

1220
01:12:19.780 --> 01:12:23.580
that's like Ellen degenerate or something.
I'm going to go to the skate complete.

1221
01:12:23.581 --> 01:12:24.510
Completely neutral.

1222
01:12:24.940 --> 01:12:27.500
<v 8>It's a funny,
just rewind and Sean and of course we had our first,</v>

1223
01:12:27.501 --> 01:12:30.560
they never in all my years of going to east coast football games,

1224
01:12:30.561 --> 01:12:33.980
never saw someone break a beer bottle with the intent to stab another human

1225
01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:37.880
being first football game.
We went to San Francisco at the old part.
Yeah.

1226
01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:42.560
A Raven's niners game was sitting in traffic trying to leave the game and Bam,

1227
01:12:42.561 --> 01:12:45.890
we almost witnessed a murder.
It's just,
it's,
it's much more hardcore.

1228
01:12:45.891 --> 01:12:49.970
And the game was a hilariously bad game.
It was 12 to nine.

1229
01:12:49.971 --> 01:12:53.780
There was no touchdown scored and maybe that's what got him all work.

1230
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:56.780
<v 9>Yup.
And would actually doing fans of service,</v>

1231
01:12:56.781 --> 01:13:00.040
because this story is not told at all,
you know,

1232
01:13:00.570 --> 01:13:04.010
is the eagles through batteries.
It's Santa Claus and blah,
blah,
blah.

1233
01:13:04.011 --> 01:13:08.720
Eagles and Philly and Philly and show Austin New York.
Yeah.
Yes,
but no,
you,

1234
01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.890
you can get killed out here.

1235
01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.380
<v 8>We got to cut a PSA.
Hey Listen La,</v>

1236
01:13:14.870 --> 01:13:18.110
you think it's a casual sports down but you can get murdered over the wrong

1237
01:13:18.111 --> 01:13:21.410
jersey.
All right.
Speaking of La,

1238
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:26.270
the Los Angeles Rams there at home late nine and a half points to the green bay

1239
01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:27.104
packers.
Aaron.
Yeah,

1240
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:28.043
<v 9>right.</v>

1241
01:13:31.630 --> 01:13:35.360
<v 8>Rims.
Just Ram it guys ran that knife into my ribcage.</v>

1242
01:13:36.470 --> 01:13:40.910
Cut.
Slice my cheese.
Head Up.
Uh,
I dunno,
a quick sidebar Sean,

1243
01:13:40.911 --> 01:13:42.680
but I don't know if you've noticed,
but some of the TV,

1244
01:13:42.681 --> 01:13:45.200
the local coverage of the rams.
I think because they

1245
01:13:45.490 --> 01:13:47.230
<v 9>so good.
In the beginning they didn't,
didn't</v>

1246
01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:50.410
<v 8>change anything and some of these guys just don't know football.</v>

1247
01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.990
It's pretty hilly.
It's the watch,
this shakes.
It's like,

1248
01:13:53.230 --> 01:13:56.290
this is nothing like a east coast like postgame show.

1249
01:13:56.410 --> 01:13:58.000
These people don't know anything about the game.

1250
01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:01.240
They're not even rooting for the team.
Like,
what the fuck is this?

1251
01:14:01.450 --> 01:14:03.400
It's a long way off.
But all that being said,

1252
01:14:03.401 --> 01:14:05.050
I'll take the rams lay nine and a half.

1253
01:14:05.350 --> 01:14:09.060
This team is fire Aaron Rodgers though this is his,
uh,

1254
01:14:09.130 --> 01:14:10.450
the biggest underdog.

1255
01:14:10.451 --> 01:14:15.260
He's ever like the biggest underdog spread of his entire career bill house a

1256
01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:16.360
year.
Are you going to get on that

1257
01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:20.050
<v 9>pack?
Take the package with the point.
Cause Aaron Rogers,</v>

1258
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:21.790
he's one of those guys,

1259
01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:26.791
he loves to send kids home crying and the opposing stadium like he gets up

1260
01:14:27.161 --> 01:14:30.690
toward,
he plays great on the road.
And uh,
I dunno,

1261
01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:34.270
I looked up some numbers on this one.
Package defense isn't that bad?

1262
01:14:34.271 --> 01:14:39.220
I don't think,
you know,
I dunno.
I I uh,
oh that's a tough one.

1263
01:14:39.310 --> 01:14:43.810
Just all of those points and Aaron Rodgers,
I and his competitive ways.

1264
01:14:43.811 --> 01:14:47.020
I would w I'm going with that.
You know what am I am a stand up comedian.

1265
01:14:47.021 --> 01:14:51.100
What do I know?
I'm not trying to get stabbed in la because I picked the packers.

1266
01:14:51.101 --> 01:14:51.934
I'm sorry

1267
01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:55.100
<v 8>you liked the packers to cover,
but you said the rams away now.
Right?</v>

1268
01:14:55.101 --> 01:14:56.520
To clarify if anyone had

1269
01:14:57.050 --> 01:14:58.030
<v 9>yeah,
undo me.</v>

1270
01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:02.140
They just have too many weapons there and so does the people in the crowd.

1271
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:02.974
Thank you

1272
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.760
<v 8>Kramer.
Which way you lean in.
Uh,
I mean it,
it's,</v>

1273
01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:09.880
it's an awful lot of points for one,

1274
01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:14.530
Aaron Rodgers and no matter the deficiencies they might have on defense,
this is,

1275
01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:17.500
this is even if they're down,
this is backdoor city.
Aaron,

1276
01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.810
Roger's not going to be giving up and Sean,

1277
01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:24.160
75% of the money on the Los Angeles for him.
They got to lose at some point,

1278
01:15:24.161 --> 01:15:27.490
right?
Maybe this is the week,
hypothetically and yeah,

1279
01:15:27.491 --> 01:15:31.060
you gotta think that Aaron Rodgers and you don't want to a little brother Jared

1280
01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:34.030
Goff.
Imagine Aaron Rodgers.
Like,
I'm not losing to this bitch.

1281
01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:38.620
I am not losing to this little bitch.
Well,
golf is a weight.

1282
01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:42.220
Golf came from what school?
Cow.
Cow.
Ow.
So maybe their buddies.
Well,

1283
01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:43.680
that's what I'm saying.
I think he's,

1284
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:47.560
I think Aaron Rodgers wants to prove he's the real cow.
QB.
Oh,

1285
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:50.350
little a little revenge gears Rogers older than McNay.

1286
01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:54.760
I think he's gotta be cosmic phase like 32 yeah,
that's crazy.

1287
01:15:55.090 --> 01:15:56.620
That's really crazy.
All right.

1288
01:15:56.621 --> 01:16:01.420
Last game of the slate here in New England patriots face heading into Buffalo,

1289
01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.540
where right now over my bookie.
Dot.
Agee.

1290
01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:09.810
The buffalo bills are a 14 point Monday night home dog dare,

1291
01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:14.020
journeymen Derek Anderson starting again.
I love that phrase.

1292
01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.140
And I also love they would say he signed off the street as if he was just

1293
01:16:17.141 --> 01:16:20.230
wandering around.
He's starting at quarterback for the pills.

1294
01:16:20.270 --> 01:16:23.980
Lashawn Mccoy looks like he could be out.
Bill,
do you,
uh,

1295
01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:25.450
did the Pat's role here or do you,

1296
01:16:25.490 --> 01:16:28.990
you think it's close enough that the bills are worth the taking a shot with the

1297
01:16:28.991 --> 01:16:29.824
points?

1298
01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:35.100
<v 9>I hate 14 points with the division rivalry and you're on the road and also the</v>

1299
01:16:36.101 --> 01:16:39.730
bills are so schizo phrenic this year.
This is,
this is one of these,

1300
01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:43.670
each one of these trap games,
Bill Suck right them all.

1301
01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:48.400
They won 27 nothing against the Vikings and the next week they get killed or

1302
01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:53.170
they up 27.
Nothing is biking.
I,
uh,
I'm gonna say,

1303
01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:55.540
um,
I would,

1304
01:16:55.600 --> 01:17:00.600
I would take the bills into points simply watching last week when we played the

1305
01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:03.880
damn bears and we had them,
we should have put him away,

1306
01:17:03.890 --> 01:17:07.780
should have driven down the damn oh my God.
And kicked the field goal.
Been up by,

1307
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:10.850
by,
by three scores instead we ended up,
you know,

1308
01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:13.730
when we came within a half a yard of going into overtime,

1309
01:17:13.950 --> 01:17:18.720
<v 8>that was a crazy hail Mary to get to the one yard line.</v>

1310
01:17:19.170 --> 01:17:19.960
Oh Man.

1311
01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:20.800
<v 9>Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.</v>

1312
01:17:20.801 --> 01:17:24.040
And that's that whole thing like you stick your stick a wide receiver down
there.

1313
01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:26.350
He's not going to try to knock it down.
He's gonna try to catch it.

1314
01:17:26.351 --> 01:17:27.460
That guy that wasn't Gordon,

1315
01:17:27.461 --> 01:17:31.770
the guy we got from Cleveland and he did not even try to do,

1316
01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:36.910
what did he,
he,
he was,
he was a,
he was out of his element.
Uh,

1317
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.040
they might want to run that play with him a couple of times.

1318
01:17:39.041 --> 01:17:42.040
So I think the Patriots are going to win,
but I don't,

1319
01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:43.630
I don't numbers too big there.

1320
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.030
I will say in the end they go into the prevent and it screws over the gamblers.

1321
01:17:49.180 --> 01:17:51.490
Who uh,
who checked the Patriots with 14

1322
01:17:52.150 --> 01:17:54.230
<v 8>Kramer,
I mentioned Sean night,
first of all,</v>

1323
01:17:54.231 --> 01:17:58.280
97% of the money coming in in the page early,
but it will be money night.

1324
01:17:58.370 --> 01:18:01.790
This bills,
this bills fan base will have nothing.
This is the,

1325
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:04.970
this is a super super bowl,
right?
There'll be breaking tables.

1326
01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:09.020
The price will be out there breaking tables with them.
There's,
there's,

1327
01:18:09.021 --> 01:18:12.260
there's no doubt of that.
And Buffalo strength is their past defense.

1328
01:18:12.261 --> 01:18:13.580
So I could see the way they play,

1329
01:18:13.581 --> 01:18:17.750
the way Mcdermott sits in kind of that soft coverage that a while Brady might

1330
01:18:17.751 --> 01:18:20.270
pick them apart,
the receivers are going to take hits.
Sean,
it's,

1331
01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:23.930
it's a low of 38 that night.
So yeah,

1332
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:27.680
of course you're taking 14 right?
Even with
Derek Anderson Walking,

1333
01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:31.910
what could go wrong?
What could go wrong?
There's no way.
37 to five.

1334
01:18:32.270 --> 01:18:36.220
Certainly there's blood potential here,
but uh,
I liked the bills by the way.

1335
01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.450
My wife is mocking me right now,
talking sports on the radio,

1336
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:45.490
talking sports ball,
talking sports,
swallow,
watching sports.
Hey,
it's the,

1337
01:18:45.491 --> 01:18:49.240
it's the life of a sports fan,
right?
Yeah.
Last point,
Sean.
Yes,

1338
01:18:49.241 --> 01:18:51.910
because I'm also on the bills.
Guess who the Patriots have on deck?

1339
01:18:52.210 --> 01:18:55.640
The packers come into town.
Oh look,
a head game.
APPS,
they look at spot.
I Dunno.

1340
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:59.270
Packers aren't that good.
Kind of a stretch.
But pets are pretty disciplined,

1341
01:18:59.410 --> 01:19:02.980
but still 1414 point Monday night at home dog,
there's this,

1342
01:19:03.310 --> 01:19:04.750
this is their Superbowl.
They're gonna.

1343
01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.390
They're going to be fucking going crazy in buffalo.

1344
01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.580
So I think you got to take the big numbers there.

1345
01:19:10.390 --> 01:19:15.110
<v 9>Okay.
No,
that's a great,
that's a great point.
Yeah.
Great Point.
I like that bag,</v>

1346
01:19:15.120 --> 01:19:15.953
by the way.

1347
01:19:16.390 --> 01:19:21.160
I went to a buffalo bills game and I had a patriots hat on their plan,
the jets.

1348
01:19:21.161 --> 01:19:25.600
I was rooting for the bills and I made the mistake of going into the men's.

1349
01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:31.450
Oh God just started getting all this crap and they waited til I started to take

1350
01:19:31.451 --> 01:19:32.800
a leak and somebody pushed me.

1351
01:19:34.620 --> 01:19:35.453
<v 8>That's dirty.</v>

1352
01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.000
<v 9>Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
But they don't try to kill you.
They just,</v>

1353
01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:43.750
they're just,
yeah,
they're more like a,
you know,
just like,
I don't know.

1354
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:46.520
<v 8>They just want you to bathe,
bathe in your own urine.</v>

1355
01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:51.270
Classy fan base that she shot out of Sarah at buffalo

1356
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:53.061
<v 9>by the end of the year.</v>

1357
01:19:53.061 --> 01:19:56.600
I want to label all sports fans so we're animals or the east coast.

1358
01:19:57.250 --> 01:20:00.830
They're killers on the west coast and that cheap shot artists in buffalo.

1359
01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.690
All right.
How many more buckets do we have left?

1360
01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:06.700
<v 8>Watch out for bills Mafia.
We got to go through it and solve each market.</v>

1361
01:20:07.410 --> 01:20:08.580
[inaudible] the Midwest is coming.

1362
01:20:09.770 --> 01:20:11.200
<v 9>Oh yeah.
Oh yeah.
Look out.</v>

1363
01:20:14.710 --> 01:20:18.850
I don't know what they try to bend your wife into the cheese or something.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:20.900
Yeah,

1376
01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.910
<v 9>Alright guys,
thanks for having me on.</v>

1377
01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:06.333
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

1378
01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:15.850
yeah man.
Full of Shit.

1379
01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:21.170
<v 5>Yeah,
it was fucking raining on this.</v>

1380
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:25.710
And one thing I've learned that when you go to a football game and you're

1381
01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.460
dealing with the elements,

1382
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:34.510
this is the more of a Douche bag you look like the warmer you're going to be.

1383
01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:39.820
All right.
I saw the rain and I said fuck this.

1384
01:21:39.821 --> 01:21:43.750
And we went right to Dick's sporting goods and I'm like,
I'm buying that fucking,

1385
01:21:43.751 --> 01:21:47.710
I'm going to buy a rain coat with the matching raincoats slacks.

1386
01:21:47.711 --> 01:21:48.880
I don't give a fuck.

1387
01:21:49.210 --> 01:21:53.830
I bought a pair of wool socks and I was good to go.

1388
01:21:54.670 --> 01:21:56.860
So I'm with Versie and you know,

1389
01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:01.120
they only had like two raincoats left and they were the exact same color.

1390
01:22:01.810 --> 01:22:05.650
This fucking grapes,
slush,
puppy purple.

1391
01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:09.610
So we both have matching extra large fucking,

1392
01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:15.580
we got the jackets and the pants like we're working at a fucking airport and

1393
01:22:16.361 --> 01:22:18.760
what green we're bringing in the fucking soul plane,
right?

1394
01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:21.190
That was a purple airplane.
Right.
That's what we look like.

1395
01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:23.500
So we show up to the game,
right?

1396
01:22:24.610 --> 01:22:28.210
Neither one of us has comfortable because neither one of us is a jets or a bills

1397
01:22:28.211 --> 01:22:32.680
fan.
So we're in enemy territory and a,
it's fucking drizzling and out.

1398
01:22:32.681 --> 01:22:37.330
It's fucking cold.
So I proceed to put on this Barney the dinosaur outfit,

1399
01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:41.500
right?
And right off the bat,
Versie starts pumping outgoing,
man.
I'm just gonna.

1400
01:22:41.501 --> 01:22:43.570
I'm just gonna wear that.
I'm just going to wear the top.

1401
01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:47.110
I'm just going to wear the top trying to act like it's not raining out that bad.

1402
01:22:47.290 --> 01:22:48.400
The reality is,

1403
01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.480
is he didn't want to go through the hazing that he would have to if the two of

1404
01:22:52.481 --> 01:22:56.980
us walked in with our purple on Purple fucking raincoats times too.

1405
01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:01.270
We would've got a ton of shit and I was prepared to take it.
I had an,

1406
01:23:01.271 --> 01:23:05.140
I had a whole fucking silly walk I was going to be doing.
I don't give a fuck.

1407
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:10.480
So he pumped out.
So,
uh,
we ended up walking in and put my head's cold,
right?

1408
01:23:10.481 --> 01:23:14.190
All I have is a baseball cap on.
So I'm like,
fuck,
I gotta buy a head.

1409
01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.450
Can I buy a bills?
Who gives a fuck?
They were in last place,

1410
01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.780
mail by a bill's hat and then I saw this,
this one with the Patriot logo on it.

1411
01:23:20.350 --> 01:23:24.010
I said,
fuck it.
I'll get that.
Once I put that one on,
I'm nice and warm.

1412
01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.040
We go to,
we'll call,
we pick up our tickets.

1413
01:23:27.310 --> 01:23:31.420
We go into that high school football stadium that they have out there that I

1414
01:23:31.421 --> 01:23:34.840
actually love.
It looks like an old school football stadium.

1415
01:23:34.841 --> 01:23:38.050
You know what I like about that football stadium that's about the size of a

1416
01:23:38.051 --> 01:23:42.490
football stadium that holds real fans,
you know what I mean?
All these,

1417
01:23:42.491 --> 01:23:46.400
these new ones that hold like 100,000 fucking pets,
all the bandwagon shit hits.

1418
01:23:46.810 --> 01:23:50.050
You know when you're all in for the real fucking fans show up are Oh and three,

1419
01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:55.000
right?
So we walk into the Goddamn stadium we love in life,
right?

1420
01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.700
I'm already laughing at [inaudible] cause I know damn well what's going to

1421
01:23:57.701 --> 01:23:59.380
happen?
He's going to walk out there,

1422
01:23:59.381 --> 01:24:03.100
there's going to be some shitty little plastic seat that's going to be covered

1423
01:24:03.310 --> 01:24:07.360
in fucking water and the only way he's going to be able to absorb it is through

1424
01:24:07.361 --> 01:24:10.240
his God damn jeans and his fucking DVDs.

1425
01:24:10.241 --> 01:24:14.530
And then he's going to be sitting there with a wrinkled up nut sack that's going

1426
01:24:14.531 --> 01:24:18.310
to be getting hypothermia by second quarter.
Why do I know this?

1427
01:24:18.311 --> 01:24:22.330
Because I've been there.
So we get a couple of beers,

1428
01:24:22.331 --> 01:24:25.750
we get this fucking beef on a stick or whatever the fuck they call it.

1429
01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:29.050
We're good to go.
We go in there,
sit down,

1430
01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:34.000
he sits basically down in a fucking puddle.
He tried to stick a newspaper down,

1431
01:24:34.001 --> 01:24:37.810
which is a very absorbent and uh,
I don't know,

1432
01:24:37.811 --> 01:24:41.530
we sat there and I had hoped for about eight seconds in that game and the jets

1433
01:24:41.531 --> 01:24:45.610
came down and just fucking did they just kick the shit out of him.

1434
01:24:46.270 --> 01:24:50.710
Christ.
They kicked the shit out of 'em and uh,

1435
01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:53.770
it was just over him.
So we,

1436
01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.210
so immediately our solution is just to start drinking the way we drank at the

1437
01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:01.090
masters.
We're like,
fuck it,
let's,
let's,
let's get going here.
Right?

1438
01:25:01.091 --> 01:25:05.770
So we'll make a trip after trip and all of a sudden I gotta take a Piss.
Right?

1439
01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:10.690
So I go and I'm standing in line and all of a sudden this,

1440
01:25:10.691 --> 01:25:15.691
this fucking six foot five goofy looking jackass,

1441
01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:18.640
one of those guys who's like six foot five,

1442
01:25:18.641 --> 01:25:21.730
but you still think he can take him cause he's just covered in baby fat.

1443
01:25:22.270 --> 01:25:25.960
You know,
he's got a couple of whiskers on his chin and his cheeks,

1444
01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:27.790
her rosier than Saint Nick.
Right?

1445
01:25:28.020 --> 01:25:31.660
And he's got this Jersey on and this big stupid,

1446
01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:35.830
I'm a buffalo bills fan with the horns on it and stuff.
You know,

1447
01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:40.510
he's the Wacky Guy,
so I'm not even thinking shit.
Right.

1448
01:25:41.290 --> 01:25:44.920
This is bill's jets.
I don't have a dog in this fight.
I'm not talking any shit.

1449
01:25:45.010 --> 01:25:45.820
I'm fine.

1450
01:25:45.820 --> 01:25:50.440
I forgot I was wearing my patriots hat and all of a sudden this big goofy

1451
01:25:50.441 --> 01:25:54.430
jackass starts going,
wait,
what?
Yeah,
we'll,
you're a patriots fan.

1452
01:25:54.431 --> 01:25:57.940
He liked the rats.
We got ran over here.
The rats.

1453
01:25:57.941 --> 01:26:02.770
He likes to fucking reds this shit.
Right?
And I'm like,
yeah,
yeah,
no,

1454
01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:04.340
whatever.
He starts giving me Shit,

1455
01:26:04.341 --> 01:26:08.830
I start giving them shit back then the weirdest fucking thing happened.
I,

1456
01:26:08.900 --> 01:26:12.890
by the time I get in to the actual men's room,

1457
01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:14.421
I've talked,

1458
01:26:14.421 --> 01:26:19.160
I've given these people so much fucking shit that actually there's bills and

1459
01:26:19.161 --> 01:26:23.090
jets fans at a bills and jets game.
They're playing each other.

1460
01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:28.360
They stopped giving each other shit and they teamed up together and started

1461
01:26:28.641 --> 01:26:32.780
giving me shit.
Right.
And then I just said,
I don't know what I was thinking.

1462
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:37.430
I felt like I was on stage cause it was like a crowd.
I wasn't thinking like,
Hey,

1463
01:26:37.431 --> 01:26:38.210
you know what,
Bill,

1464
01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:42.080
you really haven't had a fight outside of your family since maybe playing

1465
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:46.220
fucking street hockey in the sixth grade.
I didn't give a fuck.

1466
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:50.450
I'm in a goddamn bathroom waiting to take a piss in a goddamn trough,
by the way.

1467
01:26:51.770 --> 01:26:55.920
And uh,
and then they just started giving me a fucking,
this one dude such going,

1468
01:26:57.230 --> 01:26:58.640
Tom Brady Sucks Dick.
He Sucks Dick.
And he's like,

1469
01:26:58.641 --> 01:27:02.340
miming it like ridiculously well.
So I'm like,
Hey,
you know,

1470
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:06.670
do you do that real wealth?
Because I learned it by watching Tom Brady.
I'm like,

1471
01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:10.820
Oh yeah,
did you rent that porno?
You fucking fag gets a little uglier,

1472
01:27:11.630 --> 01:27:14.490
gets a little uglier than this other dude.
What the fuck did you do?

1473
01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:17.090
I came up with the hell he was saying to me,
and I just said,
look,

1474
01:27:17.091 --> 01:27:21.200
I'm sorry you guys have never won a Superbowl.
You know,

1475
01:27:21.860 --> 01:27:23.360
then the jets fan pipes in.
I go,

1476
01:27:23.361 --> 01:27:25.540
do you realize the last time you guys won a Superbowl,

1477
01:27:25.610 --> 01:27:28.610
Charlie Chaplin was still alive?
Do you understand that?

1478
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.530
Do you know what cars look like the last time you won?
You fucking morons.

1479
01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:37.640
And then,
uh,
then this other guy got one,
two,
we've won three super bowls,

1480
01:27:37.641 --> 01:27:41.150
I'm sorry.
Right?
And then the guy goes,
well,
you didn't play in the games.
I go,

1481
01:27:41.151 --> 01:27:45.370
neither did yo.
Then he's just standing there with this dumb look on his face.

1482
01:27:45.450 --> 01:27:50.120
Like,
oh,
that's right.
Keep staring forward.
You got nothing for getting that.

1483
01:27:50.120 --> 01:27:54.290
I don't know how to fight.
So all of a sudden it's my turn to Piss.

1484
01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:56.720
I take my dick out,
I'm ready to Piss.

1485
01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:01.670
And one of these fucking pussies pushed me in the back hoping that I was pissing

1486
01:28:01.671 --> 01:28:04.700
at the time.
Fortunately I wasn't.
So I turn around,

1487
01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:08.120
I put my dick away cause I'm a gentleman and I said,
well gee,

1488
01:28:08.121 --> 01:28:11.300
I goes and how you guys do it out here.
Really?
I go,

1489
01:28:11.301 --> 01:28:14.510
which one do you guys push me?
Like I'm gonna Fuck,
I'm fucking Jackie Chan.

1490
01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:18.050
And for some reason none of them said anything.

1491
01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:23.660
I don't know if it was my purple on purple rain coat or the look of fire in my

1492
01:28:23.661 --> 01:28:28.190
eye,
but I'm a fucking 42 year old,
balding redhead talking shit in there.

1493
01:28:28.310 --> 01:28:30.890
And none of them said anything.
So now it's kind of funny to me.

1494
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:35.360
I felt like I was in like the world series of poker and I went all in and I,

1495
01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:39.050
and I didn't have a hand whatsoever.
So I don't know who the fuck pushed me.

1496
01:28:39.051 --> 01:28:43.340
But that's what I mean.
Come on.
Bitchy is move with a fucking week.

1497
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:45.770
How do you do that?
How do you do that?
How do you,

1498
01:28:45.771 --> 01:28:49.100
how do you push another man when he's got his Goddamn Dick out trying to piss

1499
01:28:49.101 --> 01:28:51.500
into a fucking trough?
I mean,
how do you get lower than that?

1500
01:28:51.501 --> 01:28:53.870
Do you guys have any ideas?
How do you get lower than that?

1501
01:28:53.990 --> 01:28:58.100
So then after none of them said anything,
I go back and I started taking a piss.

1502
01:28:58.101 --> 01:29:01.970
And then that other dude who was miming somebody's sucking

1503
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.940
<v 1>a dick unbelievably well right next to me.</v>

1504
01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:11.760
One of those stupid hats that has the toggles on the side and he's still trying

1505
01:29:11.761 --> 01:29:13.860
to give me shit and I'm gonna go fuck yourself.

1506
01:29:13.861 --> 01:29:16.110
And then he just starts screaming over and over again.

1507
01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.850
Are you looking at my deck?

1508
01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:21.780
Are you looking at my deck like maniacally,

1509
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:26.230
like five times.
I just sort of stared at him.
Michael,

1510
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:30.750
why do you keep going with this gay angle?
Like why is there always a,

1511
01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:34.710
I don't know.
I think he was one of those guys.

1512
01:29:34.711 --> 01:29:37.040
He was kind of in the closet and then uh,

1513
01:29:37.090 --> 01:29:41.910
so he just goes to football games and he gets really drunk trying to just kill

1514
01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.820
the families.
I think he liked me is what I'm saying.

1515
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:47.400
So if he's listening to this,
I'm sorry.
Uh,

1516
01:29:47.410 --> 01:29:51.930
I'm spoken for you fucking pants.
You fucking believe that.

1517
01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:57.540
First of all,
what's wrong with me?
I really replay it,
all of that in my head.

1518
01:29:57.690 --> 01:30:01.770
Cause once I got out of there I was like,
I really started thinking like,
what?

1519
01:30:01.810 --> 01:30:03.600
What did you think you were going to do in there?

1520
01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:08.210
They're not Clint Eastwood yet saying things.
Clint Eastwood would say,
what?

1521
01:30:08.211 --> 01:30:10.230
What the fuck is wrong with you dude?
Like,

1522
01:30:10.290 --> 01:30:12.180
I don't know if I've said this before in a podcast,

1523
01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:16.920
a public bathroom is the worst fucking place to ever get into a fight.

1524
01:30:16.921 --> 01:30:19.740
There is nothing soft.

1525
01:30:19.950 --> 01:30:22.560
There's everything is porcelain pipes,

1526
01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:26.880
that concrete floor and then it has a mist of piss and shit.

1527
01:30:26.881 --> 01:30:30.210
It's just the fuck it,
it's the worst.
It's the worst place ever,

1528
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:36.270
you know,
not to mention it usually starts evidently when one person as begun,

1529
01:30:36.271 --> 01:30:37.370
the pissing processing.

1530
01:30:42.910 --> 01:30:46.390
So,
uh,
you know,
older little bit wiser.

1531
01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:50.380
So then I'm standing in line to go get some more alcohol cause God knows that's

1532
01:30:50.381 --> 01:30:52.150
what you need after an incident like that.

1533
01:30:52.810 --> 01:30:57.310
And I was just kinda just sitting there thinking like,
all right,

1534
01:30:57.311 --> 01:30:59.230
now how should I have played that?

1535
01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.230
It w it should have ended when the dude with the water buffalo hat started

1536
01:31:05.231 --> 01:31:08.230
giving me shit.
What I should've done was roll with it.

1537
01:31:09.460 --> 01:31:11.800
I should you like to patriots.
I should've been like,
hey,

1538
01:31:11.801 --> 01:31:15.310
you know you guys scored 30 on his last week,
man.
You guys look great man.
I,

1539
01:31:15.320 --> 01:31:18.490
I bet the jets,
I mean I bet against the jets.

1540
01:31:18.491 --> 01:31:22.330
I hope you guys should have just ended it with that and did it.

1541
01:31:22.380 --> 01:31:26.200
I sh I should have,
I should have extended an olive branch.

1542
01:31:26.201 --> 01:31:27.820
That's what I should've done in the future.

1543
01:31:27.821 --> 01:31:31.330
That's what the fuck I'm going to do because,
uh,

1544
01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:36.550
that was a,
that was a potentially ugly situation.
But fortunately,

1545
01:31:37.750 --> 01:31:41.260
um,
I think the people who were doing it,
you know,

1546
01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:46.390
had jobs and no one wanted to get sued and no one was willing to take it to that

1547
01:31:46.391 --> 01:31:50.080
level.
Uh,
and when I say fortunately,

1548
01:31:50.081 --> 01:31:51.880
I mean for me in my face,

1549
01:31:57.430 --> 01:32:01.900
oh,
do you know how bad that have been to get stomped in that fucking purple on

1550
01:32:01.901 --> 01:32:06.670
purple rain coat laying there with my dirty fucking patriots hat

1551
01:32:08.920 --> 01:32:13.150
and my team wasn't even playing.
I would have lost the lawsuit.

1552
01:32:13.151 --> 01:32:16.840
They would've been like,
let me get this straight.
You're a patriots fan.

1553
01:32:16.841 --> 01:32:19.270
You're a patriots hat to a bill's jets game,

1554
01:32:19.271 --> 01:32:21.490
and you somehow managed to get the shit kicked out of you.

1555
01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.190
What the fuck did you say?
You know,

1556
01:32:24.250 --> 01:32:27.490
that's one of the great things about being a guy is you actually have to take

1557
01:32:27.491 --> 01:32:30.640
responsibility for your,
for your action.
See you.
What would it be like?

1558
01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:34.540
There's no excuse.
There's no reason.
I don't care what happened.

1559
01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:38.980
You don't hit a girl,
which is true.
You don't have a fucking girl,

1560
01:32:38.981 --> 01:32:43.210
but there's no learning in that.
There's no lesson.
You know,

1561
01:32:44.410 --> 01:32:46.840
even my best friends would have been like,
yeah,
those guys

1562
01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:49.550
<v 5>fucking assholes in the,
but you know,
they would have been an awkward pause.</v>

1563
01:32:49.551 --> 01:32:50.770
And I'd be like,
dude,
what the fuck?

1564
01:32:50.860 --> 01:32:55.860
He talking shit for by yourself at a game when your team isn't even fucking

1565
01:32:55.911 --> 01:32:59.900
play.
What's wrong with you?
You're 42 years old.
Get his shit together.

1566
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:02.600
And they would have been right.
Me and my shot

1567
01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:09.020
<v 6>[inaudible] man in a pot full of shit.</v>

1568
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.230
[inaudible]

1569
01:33:19.230 --> 01:33:21.610
<v 7>yeah.
And I'm gonna kill that woman.</v>

1570
01:33:25.540 --> 01:33:25.950
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

1571
01:33:25.950 --> 01:33:28.870
<v 7>mom going through again that d dog</v>

1572
01:33:33.100 --> 01:33:35.250
have so many other Friday.
They won the watershed.

1573
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:41.840
<v 5>Hey,
what's going on?
It's built burn.
It's the Monday morning podcast from Monday,</v>

1574
01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:46.240
October 25th,
2010 hi,

1575
01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:50.250
you doing Joe?
What's going on?
Um,

1576
01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:53.640
I just got back from a,
a awesome tour.

1577
01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:54.600
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1578
01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:59.190
<v 5>A quick three,
four day tour,
three nights of a wonderful theaters.</v>

1579
01:33:59.191 --> 01:34:00.330
I feel like a big shot.

1580
01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:04.730
I worked the Wilbur Theater in Boston on Wednesday doing a fund raiser.

1581
01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:09.420
Yeah.
And then I did the pantageous theater in Minneapolis,
Minnesota.

1582
01:34:09.421 --> 01:34:14.410
One of the most underrated cities I've ever been to.
Minneapolis was the shit.

1583
01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:17.350
And I was bummed that I was only there for a day.

1584
01:34:17.990 --> 01:34:20.900
And then I went to Chicago and played the Vic theater,

1585
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:25.380
which evidently Dennis Miller did one of his recent specials that,
you know,

1586
01:34:25.890 --> 01:34:26.960
I love the toad babe.

1587
01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:31.620
I love the toad fucking quick way with the fucking coca choke bank,
you know,

1588
01:34:31.670 --> 01:34:36.320
one of my favorites of all time.
Um,
so I got to stand on the same stage.

1589
01:34:36.321 --> 01:34:38.390
I guess they did some HBO half hours there.

1590
01:34:38.391 --> 01:34:42.350
I heard a talk that Bill Hicks had possibly perform there.

1591
01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:47.570
So it was a a,
it was an amazing night tour,
I should say.
Not An,
of course.

1592
01:34:47.571 --> 01:34:52.470
I had the wonderful,
uh,
teen idol sensation from the opiate Anthony Program,

1593
01:34:52.471 --> 01:34:57.090
Joe de Rosa opening for me the entire time.
And uh,
believe it or not,

1594
01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:02.270
I hung out with Joe to Rosa and did not have a drop of alcohol.

1595
01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:06.770
All right.
Now I know a lot of you are familiar with Joe to Rosa.

1596
01:35:06.771 --> 01:35:09.830
For those of you who aren't Joe is,
um,

1597
01:35:11.450 --> 01:35:14.570
how do I put this?
Joe is a drunk,
um,

1598
01:35:15.890 --> 01:35:18.260
in every sense of the word.
He literally,
you know,

1599
01:35:19.610 --> 01:35:24.610
the amount of times he can't find his keys and passes out in some sort of fetal

1600
01:35:25.101 --> 01:35:28.490
position on the stoop of his building is just,
it's,

1601
01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:32.120
it's really just something I'm,
I'm starting to get nervous about,
you know,

1602
01:35:32.150 --> 01:35:33.470
and I'm sort of codependent.

1603
01:35:33.471 --> 01:35:38.471
So when he starts coming around with his fucking half Egyptian WC fields,

1604
01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:43.670
red fucking knows the booze usually starts flowing.

1605
01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:47.690
But I don't know what happened.
I got back into the zone.

1606
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:52.550
I got back into the fucking zone of not Busan.

1607
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:57.080
I had a,
I had to Heinekens and I know a lot of your beer drinkers will be like,

1608
01:35:57.081 --> 01:36:01.270
well,
that,
that'll do it.
Do it.
It's too fucking better,

1609
01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:05.690
too hoppy.
Um,
I had a couple of Heinekens A,
I dunno,

1610
01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.820
we could go last Saturday night.
I was like,
you know what?

1611
01:36:07.821 --> 01:36:10.250
I think I'm fucking sick of this.
Yeah.
You know,

1612
01:36:10.251 --> 01:36:14.000
I think my head is about big enough.
I think it's,
it's,
I think it's pretty much,

1613
01:36:15.050 --> 01:36:17.930
can't even say waterlogged alcohol log,
you know?

1614
01:36:17.931 --> 01:36:21.650
That's where I really figured out why I don't like boozing is because drinking a

1615
01:36:21.651 --> 01:36:26.270
ton of beer is the male equivalent to when females bitch about retaining water

1616
01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:30.500
and they just feel fucking bloated.
May Be honest with yourself.

1617
01:36:30.501 --> 01:36:32.810
It might not happen the day of the tailgate,

1618
01:36:32.811 --> 01:36:37.811
but a couple of days after the wings and those fucking Goddamn 16 ounce beers

1619
01:36:39.861 --> 01:36:43.680
you were drinking,
you just wake up in the morning,
stumble into,

1620
01:36:43.700 --> 01:36:47.210
go brush your teeth and you're like,
whoa.
You just look at that fucking

1621
01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:53.780
am I head is the size of like a fucking industrial like cookie jar.

1622
01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.160
If they made one and I was sick of it,

1623
01:36:56.161 --> 01:36:58.590
I haven't posted in like seven days and I'm noticing,
uh,

1624
01:36:58.700 --> 01:37:01.250
or eight days or nine days,
I'm up to nine days here.
It's kind of,

1625
01:37:01.251 --> 01:37:04.910
it's starting to fucking shrink a little bit and I already had a fucking big

1626
01:37:04.911 --> 01:37:09.710
goddamn head to,
the last thing I needed to do was to be adding Chins to it.

1627
01:37:14.580 --> 01:37:18.440
You know,
it's not even when you see a guy who was always sort of jolly will say,

1628
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:21.440
rather than I'm in a good mood this week,
I'm not going to say he's a fat fuck,

1629
01:37:21.441 --> 01:37:26.000
we'll just say a jolly guy.
Right.
Um,
you know,

1630
01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:28.700
his whole life,
Husky,
you know,

1631
01:37:28.940 --> 01:37:32.810
healthy on that dude.
You know,
you say I'm a five,

1632
01:37:32.811 --> 01:37:35.990
10 years later in his head's even bigger year,
a year expected.

1633
01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:40.880
But for me it's,
it's when you see the,
the,
the bean pole guys,

1634
01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:44.900
there's a couple of celebrities out there.
I don't name names on the podcast,

1635
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:48.980
but there's just one in particular who back in the day it looked like you could

1636
01:37:48.981 --> 01:37:53.480
pick them up with two fingers and just walk them over to a table,
you know,

1637
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:57.030
and uh,
saw him the other day and it's just like,
dude,

1638
01:37:59.040 --> 01:37:59.880
you know what it really is?

1639
01:37:59.881 --> 01:38:02.460
I think it's because it has to do with not being married,

1640
01:38:02.970 --> 01:38:04.830
believe it or not add it's bullshit.

1641
01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:07.380
Because what if you're married to the wrong person,
then you can be depressed.

1642
01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:11.850
You'd be eating.
I don't fucking know.
All I know is I,
I've,

1643
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:16.830
I've figured something out here is far as where if I'm going to continue

1644
01:38:16.831 --> 01:38:18.450
boozing,
I'm going to be doing it.

1645
01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.480
And it's definitely in the hotel lobby of wherever I'm staying at because that

1646
01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.400
is a much more mature place for some of my,
somewhat of my age to be at.

1647
01:38:29.730 --> 01:38:34.620
If you like make in your travel a lot and yet you keep trying to visit your old

1648
01:38:34.621 --> 01:38:38.430
haunts places,
you know,
that you'd go to when you were in your 20s,

1649
01:38:39.210 --> 01:38:43.350
possibly your early thirties.
They,
you just can't do it after a while.
You know,

1650
01:38:43.351 --> 01:38:45.150
you walk in and you know,

1651
01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:49.260
you just look like the date rape drug guy.
I mean,
why else?

1652
01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:50.520
If you're not the club owner,

1653
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:53.490
how else do you honestly think something's going to happen in there?
Right?

1654
01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:58.820
So what you want to do is you go to the hotel lobby and there what you will find

1655
01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.880
is a unhappily married people

1656
01:39:06.330 --> 01:39:09.300
and some call girls.
You know,

1657
01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:13.240
I sat there stone sober with Joe de Rosa.

1658
01:39:13.241 --> 01:39:16.200
We actually hung out one night and did not drink the night of the,
uh,

1659
01:39:16.201 --> 01:39:21.030
the show at the Vic theater,
which was fucking unbelievable by the way.
Um,

1660
01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:24.870
place was sold out and I cannot thank the people,

1661
01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:29.640
the good people of Chicago enough.
That's a great fucking city.

1662
01:39:30.450 --> 01:39:34.800
That is a great guy,
damn city.
You know the fucker's know how to eat,

1663
01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.450
they know how to drink,

1664
01:39:36.690 --> 01:39:40.170
they know how to grow a mustache and they won a Stanley Cup.

1665
01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.800
They were in a great fucking mood and I went up there and had an awesome set.

1666
01:39:43.801 --> 01:39:47.130
But anyways,
so we hung out at this,
this um,

1667
01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:50.970
hung out there.
Yeah,
the hotel lounge.

1668
01:39:50.970 --> 01:39:55.970
And we were just laughing about how pathetic our friendship is when you remove

1669
01:39:56.521 --> 01:39:58.910
alcohol.
We sat there,
oh,

1670
01:39:59.190 --> 01:40:02.700
this is a fucking dude I've known for seven years in the fact that we weren't

1671
01:40:02.701 --> 01:40:07.380
drinking and breaking balls at that hour of the night.

1672
01:40:07.381 --> 01:40:09.000
It was like an awkward first date

1673
01:40:10.890 --> 01:40:15.810
just sitting there other than just making fun of how we had absolutely nothing

1674
01:40:15.811 --> 01:40:18.800
to talk about.
And that's when we just started looking around,

1675
01:40:18.810 --> 01:40:22.310
looking at the people look like that movie up in the air someplace.

1676
01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:25.140
I Clooney's character would hang out.
And we're just sitting there laughing,

1677
01:40:25.710 --> 01:40:28.170
trying to get the jobs that people are doing,
you know?

1678
01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:33.740
And then all of a sudden these two fucking knockouts out of nowhere come walking

1679
01:40:34.171 --> 01:40:36.990
by and you know,

1680
01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:40.470
so I do what you always do.
You fucking look at them.

1681
01:40:40.510 --> 01:40:42.930
You don't look at them right in the eye.
And this is what gave him away.

1682
01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:47.220
They didn't look away.
And I was like,

1683
01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:51.840
oh,
they're professionals.
Wow.
This is a whole,
there's a whole new environment.

1684
01:40:53.100 --> 01:40:55.600
I gotta admit I liked it.
The music wasn't loud.

1685
01:40:55.900 --> 01:41:00.250
It was totally geared for a 42 year old loser like myself.

1686
01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.110
And I really enjoyed myself.

1687
01:41:02.111 --> 01:41:06.730
I didn't had a water and I ate a case of dia and I,
uh,

1688
01:41:06.731 --> 01:41:11.110
I don't know.
I had a great fucking time,
so I'm going to see how long I can go.

1689
01:41:11.111 --> 01:41:14.530
I'm really going to,
I'm going to try to go until the Rosebowl cause you know,

1690
01:41:14.531 --> 01:41:18.190
you know my rule,
I got to start the year off right by a,

1691
01:41:18.191 --> 01:41:21.490
just making a complete ass of myself at the granddaddy of them all.

1692
01:41:21.491 --> 01:41:24.580
So if I make it that far,

1693
01:41:24.610 --> 01:41:26.500
that'll be 76 days sober.

1694
01:41:26.501 --> 01:41:31.030
Saw break my old record by one day and I won't,

1695
01:41:31.031 --> 01:41:35.410
I won't put it so fucking far out of reach that when I started drinking again,

1696
01:41:35.411 --> 01:41:40.000
I won't feel like I can't get back to,
you know,
maybe 77 days.
All right.

1697
01:41:40.001 --> 01:41:43.630
Was that boring?
Good.
This is the new sober meek.

1698
01:41:44.080 --> 01:41:47.320
I get no stories from the road.
Oh,
let's talk about our Minneapolis.

1699
01:41:47.321 --> 01:41:50.560
Why Minneapolis was the shit.
I actually,
uh,

1700
01:41:50.620 --> 01:41:55.270
I got an a day early and I'm like,
God damn it.
I don't have my phone on me.

1701
01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.480
I did a great radio show.
I forget the name of it of course,

1702
01:41:58.630 --> 01:42:01.330
because I was half asleep.
Phenomenal fucking interview.

1703
01:42:02.170 --> 01:42:05.590
And I'm actually going to start listening to the show online.

1704
01:42:05.740 --> 01:42:07.750
We'll have this information on the [inaudible] podcast.

1705
01:42:07.751 --> 01:42:10.420
I just kind of woke up and did this podcast so I don't have my fucking phone

1706
01:42:10.421 --> 01:42:13.390
with me.
Um,
and then I actually,
I took a tour.

1707
01:42:13.391 --> 01:42:15.880
This is how much of a sports Goddamn nerd I am.

1708
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:18.610
I took a tour of the twins,

1709
01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:23.230
knew a baseball stadium.
The target,
uh,

1710
01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:27.370
target field to target fucking owns Minneapolis.

1711
01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:28.421
All right.

1712
01:42:28.421 --> 01:42:32.410
The way Jp Morgan owned Manhattan back in the day when he used to walk around

1713
01:42:32.411 --> 01:42:37.411
with his top hat in his shoes with those fucking white things around the ankles

1714
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:42.400
to let people know that you're fucking rich.
Target owns that Goddamn city.

1715
01:42:42.790 --> 01:42:44.620
But uh,
if you're in Minneapolis,

1716
01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:47.050
you need to kill a couple of fucking hours before a flight.

1717
01:42:47.051 --> 01:42:50.720
I suggest taking a tour of a target field before they close it down for the

1718
01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:55.190
awareness.
It was awesome.
It was a fucking great ball park.

1719
01:42:55.191 --> 01:42:58.990
I definitely want to come back to Minneapolis and uh,
it's another one.

1720
01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:01.650
They had good food.
They had a,

1721
01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:05.080
all of this whole strip of restaurants and then where I played the pantageous,

1722
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:08.530
they had a whole strip of theaters.
They had all little scene going on.

1723
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:12.490
Great bars.
You know,
that I stood in not drinking,

1724
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:16.690
having drunk people from the show coming up to me,
you know,
talking to me,

1725
01:43:16.691 --> 01:43:20.410
realizing that this is what you look like,
Bill,
here's a little life lesson,

1726
01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:25.290
but I do,
I do.
I have to criticize Minneapolis about one thing.
Uh,

1727
01:43:25.330 --> 01:43:28.030
I walked by one of their,
uh,

1728
01:43:28.031 --> 01:43:31.630
their bus stops and I guess it was a major bus stop because it was 40 people

1729
01:43:31.631 --> 01:43:32.170
there,

1730
01:43:32.170 --> 01:43:37.170
40 of the brokest look and fucking people I've ever seen in my life.

1731
01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:40.810
Okay.
White,
black,
Asian.

1732
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:44.230
I don't give a fuck what race I,

1733
01:43:44.231 --> 01:43:46.180
there was no connection to make.

1734
01:43:46.181 --> 01:43:50.020
Like how this level of brokeness happened.

1735
01:43:51.170 --> 01:43:53.150
I walked by,
I was actually nervous.
I was like,

1736
01:43:53.151 --> 01:43:56.240
someone's gonna slug me in the head and try to take my fucking wallet because if

1737
01:43:56.241 --> 01:44:00.200
I looked at the way these fucking people looked,
I would do the exact same thing.

1738
01:44:00.410 --> 01:44:05.270
I saw a meth couple.
I don't know what they were.
He's dirty,

1739
01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.890
uh,
looking people.
The girl looked like a,
I don't know.

1740
01:44:08.910 --> 01:44:13.280
She was high on something and they had a baby.
She had a baby man.

1741
01:44:13.500 --> 01:44:18.310
Shit fucking baby sitting there right by the,
uh,
the bus stop.
It was just a,

1742
01:44:19.830 --> 01:44:24.350
yeah,
but you ever just want to rescue a baby?
Not like abduct him.
You know,

1743
01:44:24.380 --> 01:44:29.380
you just rescue them like you would a goddamn dog and one of those Sarah

1744
01:44:29.781 --> 01:44:32.660
mclachlan commercials,
why don't they have a commercial?
Why can't you do that?

1745
01:44:34.010 --> 01:44:38.270
If you see a meth couple drugged out couple,
you know,

1746
01:44:38.300 --> 01:44:40.670
and they're sitting down on the fucking sidewalk,

1747
01:44:41.940 --> 01:44:46.490
like to lay on a bed with fresh linens,

1748
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:49.880
with a fucking baby,
you know,

1749
01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:55.520
I wonder what they,
they,
they would charge you with abduction.
But I,
how much,

1750
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:57.950
how much of any lawyers listen to this shit?

1751
01:44:58.370 --> 01:45:00.740
How much time would you get if you just saw like,
look,

1752
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:04.370
the fucking baby was being neglected.
So I took it.

1753
01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:08.300
He could get away with that shit.
You really couldn't.
They'd be like,
well,

1754
01:45:08.301 --> 01:45:11.660
why didn't you call the proper services?
Uh,

1755
01:45:12.110 --> 01:45:14.840
cause I don't know what that would involve looking shit up and trying to find a

1756
01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:19.480
number.
I went with the,
uh,
the immediacy of just fucking taken it.
All right.

1757
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:21.710
I believe I've meandered enough.
Here's,

1758
01:45:21.711 --> 01:45:26.560
here's a couple of comments from past white,
uh,
white pass,
uh,
podcast.
Uh,

1759
01:45:26.570 --> 01:45:31.220
this one's called the white man,
what I call it.
Uh,
oh,
someone said,

1760
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:33.740
uh,
hey,
bill and behind in podcast.

1761
01:45:33.770 --> 01:45:36.350
So you may have already gotten emails about this,

1762
01:45:36.680 --> 01:45:39.620
but Christopher Columbus was actually a redhead.

1763
01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:43.740
I was making fun of Christopher Columbus a few weeks ago on Columbus Day.
And uh,

1764
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:46.370
this guy is saying Christopher.
Oh,
I remember what I said.

1765
01:45:46.610 --> 01:45:49.370
I was saying how Christopher Columbus,
actually,

1766
01:45:49.760 --> 01:45:53.150
he had blonde hair in my history books.

1767
01:45:53.151 --> 01:45:57.230
So this guy is saying he was actually a redhead.
I think throughout history,

1768
01:45:57.470 --> 01:46:00.410
anyone who decided to walk,
sale,
fly,

1769
01:46:00.411 --> 01:46:05.411
swim toward toward inevitable doom at the end of the world was inevitably a

1770
01:46:06.411 --> 01:46:09.530
psychotic ginger.
That would have been good.

1771
01:46:09.531 --> 01:46:11.570
Can I give you some tips on joke writing?

1772
01:46:11.870 --> 01:46:16.760
Don't use the same word in the setup and in the punch.
You said inevitable twice.

1773
01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:19.400
And of course I'm reading it,
so that really kills it.

1774
01:46:19.550 --> 01:46:21.890
Now this goes back to my theory of,
uh,
when they,

1775
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:24.320
they talk about new information throughout history.

1776
01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:27.410
When exactly did they suddenly discover that he was a redhead?

1777
01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:32.870
Did you find some 600 year old whore who actually used to bang them

1778
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:36.950
and she was just,
yeah,
he actually,
yeah,
he had red hair.

1779
01:46:38.090 --> 01:46:42.540
Carpets matched the drakes.
Um,
that's like the,

1780
01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.960
that's like the fucking,
uh,
the,
the,
these,

1781
01:46:44.961 --> 01:46:48.110
these black dudes that was standing on the corner of Minneapolis,
uh,
you know,

1782
01:46:48.111 --> 01:46:49.740
those guys who scream about religion,

1783
01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:54.760
do they ever have like the levels of their pa a juxtapose correctly?

1784
01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:56.680
They are always talking way too loud.

1785
01:47:06.130 --> 01:47:08.030
<v 0>Do you have a mother fucker?</v>

1786
01:47:10.750 --> 01:47:13.990
<v 5>And you know what's funny is half to white people who walk by,</v>

1787
01:47:14.150 --> 01:47:16.270
they probably think that they're getting,
making that face,

1788
01:47:16.271 --> 01:47:20.480
like disapproving of the message rather than the level of,
it's just,

1789
01:47:21.450 --> 01:47:24.460
dude.
Yeah.
Get a new fucking PA,

1790
01:47:25.590 --> 01:47:27.730
get a fucking Goddamn,
uh,

1791
01:47:28.660 --> 01:47:31.180
whatever the fuck you call the person who knows how to run the board.

1792
01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.650
Make it a clean sound.
Okay.
Instead of being like,

1793
01:47:36.860 --> 01:47:37.693
<v 0>[inaudible],</v>

1794
01:47:41.690 --> 01:47:43.560
what's your black,
oh,
the paradox.

1795
01:47:51.790 --> 01:47:56.170
<v 5>Excuse me,
sir.
Not trying to interrupt your hate.
Um,
I just,</v>

1796
01:47:56.171 --> 01:48:01.090
it's really difficult to understand what it is I'm supposed to be offended by

1797
01:48:01.330 --> 01:48:04.800
when I can't understand what it is you're saying.
Okay.
Um,

1798
01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:09.580
Joe Rosa actually said to the Guy Jesus was white and one of his,
his,
uh,
uh,

1799
01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:13.530
terminator x guys actually laughed and then another guy stared at him and then

1800
01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:15.960
he went right back to the,
uh,
fuck white people face.

1801
01:48:19.110 --> 01:48:19.771
Once again.

1802
01:48:19.771 --> 01:48:23.940
Another classic example why I stay away from organized religion because it leads

1803
01:48:23.941 --> 01:48:27.990
you to that.
You know,
Jesus loves everybody,

1804
01:48:27.991 --> 01:48:32.460
but he's our color and he loves us best,
but he loves everyone.

1805
01:48:35.610 --> 01:48:39.170
Um,
anyways,
let's plow ahead here.
I'm sure that bothered a lot of your ears.

1806
01:48:39.171 --> 01:48:43.340
I apologize for that,
but that's literally what the fuck it sounded like.

1807
01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:48.480
MMM.
Yeah.
I would like to do that on a street corner.

1808
01:48:48.481 --> 01:48:52.380
I have a really bad pa like that and just be saying a bunch of fucking reverse

1809
01:48:52.381 --> 01:48:54.420
racist shit about white people.

1810
01:48:58.930 --> 01:49:02.100
I wonder if anybody would get it,
the amount of people who wouldn't,

1811
01:49:02.101 --> 01:49:05.280
that was what would make it really hilarious.
Yeah.
But he's white.

1812
01:49:05.281 --> 01:49:10.110
I don't understand.
Um,
all right,
here's a quick question that I got this week,
uh,

1813
01:49:10.111 --> 01:49:11.910
on Peyton manning a bill.

1814
01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.750
I am a college student in New York City and I love the podcast and your comedy.

1815
01:49:15.810 --> 01:49:20.010
I am a die hard giants fan and the kid down the hall is from Indiana.

1816
01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:21.000
And as a colts fan,

1817
01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:25.800
for some reason he feels the giants were lucky to beat the 18 and oh patriots

1818
01:49:26.530 --> 01:49:30.440
and that they flat out suck.
Um,

1819
01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.140
but Peyton was not lucky to win against the rex Grossman led.

1820
01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:39.280
Here's your fucking Superbowl coats.
Chicago bears.

1821
01:49:39.640 --> 01:49:44.260
I need you to go on another rant to explain these two super bowls and which one

1822
01:49:44.261 --> 01:49:48.370
was more legitimate?
Um,
all right.
First of all,

1823
01:49:48.970 --> 01:49:53.320
you're,
you're,
you're playing into his hand.
All right?

1824
01:49:54.220 --> 01:49:58.170
He's just deliberately saying,
shit that's gonna Piss you off and,
and you're,

1825
01:49:58.171 --> 01:50:01.810
you're taking the bait.
All right.
The giants weren't lucky.

1826
01:50:01.811 --> 01:50:03.100
The giants are actually,

1827
01:50:03.101 --> 01:50:08.101
the 2007 giants are arguably the most underrated Superbowl team of all fucking

1828
01:50:10.061 --> 01:50:15.061
time because everyone was so fixated that the patriots lost.

1829
01:50:15.220 --> 01:50:17.710
That was the story rather than

1830
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:24.160
the giants had one of the most undeniable championships of all time.

1831
01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:27.130
They were on the road the whole time.
They went down to Tampa Bay,

1832
01:50:27.310 --> 01:50:31.740
they beat Tampa in Tampa.
Then they went to Dallas,

1833
01:50:32.050 --> 01:50:34.060
beat the cowboys in Dallas,

1834
01:50:34.570 --> 01:50:38.620
then they went to green bay and beat Green Bay in fucking Greenbay.

1835
01:50:40.450 --> 01:50:42.460
And then they went to to,
uh,
uh,

1836
01:50:42.461 --> 01:50:46.660
the Superbowl and for some reason was 17 point underdogs to a team that they

1837
01:50:46.661 --> 01:50:49.390
scored like 35 points on a month earlier,

1838
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:52.990
still kicking myself in the ass that I didn't take that bet.
Um,

1839
01:50:54.220 --> 01:50:58.540
and fucking just,
you know,
blasted the Patriots right in the mouth,

1840
01:50:58.850 --> 01:51:01.720
kick their fucking ass.
They're really kicked our ass because of the score.

1841
01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:04.870
But as far as like when it really came down to like a,

1842
01:51:06.580 --> 01:51:10.510
just the offense,
the defensive line just crushed our offensive line.
I mean,

1843
01:51:10.750 --> 01:51:12.730
I don't know.
I don't think they're underrated at all.

1844
01:51:12.731 --> 01:51:17.731
I actually don't feel that the 2007 giants get the respect that they deserve and

1845
01:51:17.741 --> 01:51:22.150
it's a fucking shame that the patriots hadn't lost just one game.

1846
01:51:22.151 --> 01:51:24.680
So then maybe they could have focused on that.
I mean,

1847
01:51:24.681 --> 01:51:28.210
my theory is if the Patriots actually just lost the game during the regular

1848
01:51:28.210 --> 01:51:31.030
season,
maybe they could have just,
they could,
uh,
uh,

1849
01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:35.050
actually had a weekend to themselves and not at a bunch of cameras up their

1850
01:51:35.051 --> 01:51:39.710
asses.
Um,
anyways,
I,
so I,

1851
01:51:39.711 --> 01:51:42.700
I totally disagree with that,
but I think this guy's just trying to piss you off.

1852
01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:46.900
And as far as the,
uh,
the colts play in the bears,
I mean,

1853
01:51:46.901 --> 01:51:49.330
it's not their fault that the bears,
that the,

1854
01:51:49.331 --> 01:51:53.200
all these other NFC teams couldn't beat fucking rex Grossman,

1855
01:51:54.220 --> 01:51:56.260
if I remember correctly.
Rex Grossman,

1856
01:51:56.500 --> 01:52:01.000
anything beyond 12 yards was a hail Mary.
Am I crazy thinking that shit?

1857
01:52:01.450 --> 01:52:05.360
Am I crazy?
This whole call?
What
these motherfuckers,

1858
01:52:05.690 --> 01:52:08.820
lot of Patrick Shit can have black quarterback.

1859
01:52:08.970 --> 01:52:13.900
What the fuck was that show called?
What ma'am?
Um,
anyways,

1860
01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:16.150
yeah,
so all he's trying to do is just,
uh,

1861
01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:21.400
he's just trying to piss you off and you're allowing that to happen.
And,

1862
01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.770
uh,
you know,
I don't,
I'm amazed that you are allowing that to happen because,
uh,

1863
01:52:26.980 --> 01:52:29.680
you know,
say what you want about rex Grossman,

1864
01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:32.530
he didn't throw a pick six to lose the fucking game.

1865
01:52:33.850 --> 01:52:36.790
He just kind of threw a bunch of shitty passes for four quarters.

1866
01:52:40.340 --> 01:52:43.160
All right.
Um,
speaking of which,
um,

1867
01:52:43.210 --> 01:52:46.760
I want to talk to San Diego charger this week and,
uh,

1868
01:52:46.761 --> 01:52:51.761
I want to know what the fuck you guys did to the football gods.

1869
01:52:54.170 --> 01:52:56.990
Okay.
Now this,
this is a group of people that,
uh,

1870
01:52:57.710 --> 01:53:01.070
evidently we're rivals with something that I wasn't aware of,

1871
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:07.460
um,
because we usually beat them,
you know,
which always amazed me.

1872
01:53:07.490 --> 01:53:11.540
Y Yankee fans,
you know,
back in the day,
hated red sox fans.
It's just like,

1873
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:14.230
why would you even bother do,

1874
01:53:14.330 --> 01:53:17.660
why did you even notice the music there between us and the fucking,
you know,

1875
01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:21.890
the Goddamn twins at this point,
we always lose to you,
you know,
back in the day.

1876
01:53:23.630 --> 01:53:25.520
Um,
but anyways,

1877
01:53:25.521 --> 01:53:30.521
like the amount of fucking times that the chargers have beaten the fucking

1878
01:53:30.531 --> 01:53:35.060
patriots and still lost the game is just,
it's just,
it's fucking beyond me.

1879
01:53:36.590 --> 01:53:40.190
Do you remember that one year in the uh,
I believe it was the playoffs.
Playoffs.

1880
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:46.310
Um,
they like stopped us.
We were down,
I don't know how many points we were down,

1881
01:53:46.730 --> 01:53:47.511
but we were down,

1882
01:53:47.511 --> 01:53:52.250
it was the end of the game and they stopped us on fourth and short fucking games

1883
01:53:52.251 --> 01:53:54.350
over.
All they gotta do is take a knee and run out the clock,

1884
01:53:54.351 --> 01:53:59.351
but some fucking idiot on their defense gets like a personal foul on the play.

1885
01:54:02.780 --> 01:54:04.370
Completely unnecessary,

1886
01:54:05.090 --> 01:54:08.660
which gives the Patriots have first down and allows them to continue their drive

1887
01:54:08.661 --> 01:54:12.320
to then go ahead and,
and steal the fucking game.

1888
01:54:13.970 --> 01:54:16.760
Now yesterday wasn't the same scenario.

1889
01:54:16.761 --> 01:54:19.370
That was a case of the Patriots blow in the fucking game.

1890
01:54:20.330 --> 01:54:25.330
But it's like you're right there to tie it and you know,

1891
01:54:25.431 --> 01:54:29.090
if you tied it,
you're going to beat us.
You got to 45 yarder,

1892
01:54:29.270 --> 01:54:31.370
which is totally makeable by this guy.

1893
01:54:31.670 --> 01:54:35.690
And then someone on your offensive line has a fucking false start.

1894
01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:40.700
Five yard penalty.
Now it's a fucking 50.
Yarder I gotta be honest with you.

1895
01:54:40.701 --> 01:54:44.540
I thought,
I thought that that guy was going to miss the 45 yarder.
Uh,

1896
01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:47.300
he just didn't have that.
I'm going to nail this look on his face,

1897
01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:52.600
but then I thought once that guy got the five yard penalty and became a 50 yard

1898
01:54:53.510 --> 01:54:56.060
kick,
the fact that if he missed it,

1899
01:54:56.061 --> 01:54:59.330
it was people were going to be blaming the fucking cunt on the offensive line.

1900
01:54:59.331 --> 01:55:02.720
I figured maybe that took the pressure off it and he was going to hit it and lo

1901
01:55:02.721 --> 01:55:06.230
and behold,
the guy kicks it plenty of fucking leg.

1902
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:11.050
And you know,
and just typical of the torture of that,

1903
01:55:11.051 --> 01:55:15.440
these I feel San Diego charger fans do not deserve at this point.

1904
01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:17.360
They have paid their fucking dues.

1905
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:21.800
He didn't even have the decency to just kick it fucking wide.
Right.

1906
01:55:21.801 --> 01:55:25.400
And you knew the second was off his foot.
You could be like,
oh,
what the fuck?

1907
01:55:25.550 --> 01:55:26.383
Right.

1908
01:55:28.110 --> 01:55:32.330
It's the whole way you will,
you,
you couldn't tell either way.

1909
01:55:32.420 --> 01:55:36.380
Is it gonna is it gonna be good?
Is,
is he going to miss it?

1910
01:55:36.381 --> 01:55:41.381
It actually hit the upright and does it bounce in somehow miraculously and they

1911
01:55:41.841 --> 01:55:45.960
tied up now it just fucking falls to the ground kick is no good.

1912
01:55:46.410 --> 01:55:50.700
And um,
San Diego fans,
I want to know what do you think you did?

1913
01:55:50.850 --> 01:55:54.210
Cause I remember back in the day when the red sox would blow it and they had the

1914
01:55:54.211 --> 01:55:57.420
curse of the Babe,
you know,
at least we had something to,
to,

1915
01:55:57.421 --> 01:56:01.230
to try to blame it on.
What did you guys do out there?

1916
01:56:03.180 --> 01:56:06.960
Was it because,
uh,
was,
was there a group of Indians,

1917
01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:11.790
they're having a good time and then fucking Mr San Diego came in and fucking

1918
01:56:11.910 --> 01:56:15.480
raped and killed all of them.
The named that area after himself.

1919
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:18.640
Is that what happened?
What happened out there?
Oh,
by the way,
this in,

1920
01:56:18.641 --> 01:56:22.170
in this week's,
this week's,
um,
or this month,

1921
01:56:22.171 --> 01:56:26.310
I don't even know if rollingstones monthly or weekly,
um,
edition.

1922
01:56:26.610 --> 01:56:31.610
They have that dead dude from entourage who plays the manager on our side was in

1923
01:56:31.651 --> 01:56:36.030
sports illustrated and they asked him how he felt when the red sox came back in

1924
01:56:36.031 --> 01:56:39.780
2004 and beat the Yankees and he's a big time Yankee Fan.

1925
01:56:40.530 --> 01:56:42.090
And he goes,
I was happy.

1926
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:45.270
I was happy that they finally won it because I was so sick of them.

1927
01:56:45.300 --> 01:56:46.710
Listen to them complain.

1928
01:56:47.430 --> 01:56:51.980
How fucking hilarious is that really where you're really happy.
Oh,

1929
01:56:52.080 --> 01:56:56.260
I was glad you guys won.
Really?
We use sick or rubbing our noses.

1930
01:56:56.480 --> 01:56:58.440
You fucking lying piece of shit.

1931
01:56:58.441 --> 01:57:02.490
You were sitting there chatting in 1918 with all of them.
Jesus Christ.

1932
01:57:02.491 --> 01:57:06.480
That's like fucking Regis Filburn.
After we,
after we won it,
he was like,
yeah,

1933
01:57:06.481 --> 01:57:08.970
you want it.
You want it all right.
Whatever.
Enough already,
you know,

1934
01:57:08.971 --> 01:57:13.350
move on fucking faggot Yankee fans,
there's such pussies.

1935
01:57:13.351 --> 01:57:16.380
All they can do is talk shit for fucking all this time.

1936
01:57:16.381 --> 01:57:18.330
And then the second it comes around for them to talk and Shit,

1937
01:57:18.420 --> 01:57:20.940
they got to act like,
oh yeah,
yeah,
I'm happy for you guys.
Yeah,
I'm happy.

1938
01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:23.760
Stand there and take it.
You fucking midget.

1939
01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:28.710
Whatever the fuck you goddamn name is.
Manage your own entourage.

1940
01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:30.750
You weren't happy.
You were fucking pissed.

1941
01:57:30.930 --> 01:57:35.530
You had your head between your little fucking midget knobby knees.
Oh,
Jeff,

1942
01:57:35.690 --> 01:57:37.710
to the happy you guys want when the Yankees win.

1943
01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:41.700
I'm never happy I have the balls to fucking admit that.
All right there.

1944
01:57:41.701 --> 01:57:46.320
Fucking little man with a better career than me.
Her right then let's plow ahead.

1945
01:57:50.160 --> 01:57:54.840
Um,
it's amazing that we still won and his comments still pissed me off.

1946
01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:58.980
I wanted misery.
I wanted misery out of those guys.
I was speaking of,

1947
01:57:58.981 --> 01:58:01.740
which I don't even know what's going on in baseball.
I know the Rangers won.

1948
01:58:02.220 --> 01:58:05.100
Congratulations.
All right.

1949
01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:08.850
Which once again makes me wonder what the fuck the people of San Diego did.

1950
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:12.480
Cause here it is.
The people of Dallas are just,
you know,

1951
01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.340
now I'm ready to blow my fucking head off that

1952
01:58:15.930 --> 01:58:18.730
Goddamn Tony Romo can't fucking complete if the fucking play college,

1953
01:58:18.990 --> 01:58:23.850
they go nuts down there.
All right,
here it is.
Baseball,

1954
01:58:24.210 --> 01:58:27.390
sports.
They don't even give a shit about,
actually wait a minute.

1955
01:58:27.391 --> 01:58:31.140
The longhorns are always in fucking,
uh,
the college world series aren't they?

1956
01:58:31.170 --> 01:58:34.890
But that's way down there and fucking Austin.
But whatever.

1957
01:58:35.730 --> 01:58:39.660
It's like the cowboys has shit in the Goddamn bed and uh,

1958
01:58:42.250 --> 01:58:43.630
then all of a sudden the rage is,
come on,

1959
01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:45.070
give them something to fucking Shira Bob.

1960
01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:50.080
So I don't know actually like the Phillies and I like the giants at,

1961
01:58:50.830 --> 01:58:53.840
uh,
I guess just because the giants haven't won it so long,
I'd like,

1962
01:58:53.860 --> 01:58:56.830
I'd love to see the rangers first of giants and I think I'll actually watch the

1963
01:58:57.220 --> 01:58:59.560
goddamn world series.
I actually,

1964
01:58:59.561 --> 01:59:02.710
when the ranger started kicking the shit out of the Yankees,
I started,
you know,

1965
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:07.900
peaking into bars and watching it because I was amazed at a $55 million team

1966
01:59:07.901 --> 01:59:09.130
could have such a great lineup.

1967
01:59:09.131 --> 01:59:13.330
And what sucks about baseball is half those guys will end up on the red sox or

1968
01:59:13.340 --> 01:59:15.940
the fucking Yankees,
uh,

1969
01:59:15.941 --> 01:59:20.230
which really has to stop or am I completely full or,

1970
01:59:20.500 --> 01:59:22.000
or am I completely full of Shit?

1971
01:59:23.500 --> 01:59:27.190
Because despite the fact that the fucking red sox spent all that goddamned
money,

1972
01:59:27.191 --> 01:59:29.140
did they make the playoffs?
No,
they did not.

1973
01:59:30.060 --> 01:59:33.160
And could the Yankees beat of $55 million team?
No,
they couldn't.

1974
01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:36.790
And plus the muscles finally starting to read all this shit about these other

1975
01:59:36.791 --> 01:59:40.480
fucking cheap bastard known as like the Goddamn guys with the pirates who just

1976
01:59:40.481 --> 01:59:43.840
make a profit every year and don't even try to make,
put a winner on the field.

1977
01:59:44.470 --> 01:59:46.690
I think the whole God damn sport needs to be rehauled.

1978
01:59:46.810 --> 01:59:50.050
That's what the fuck I say.
Rehauled or overhauled.

1979
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:54.370
Do you know I was watching the,
uh,
this is just a completely random podcasts.

1980
01:59:54.371 --> 01:59:59.371
I was watching the Jersey shore last night though the final episode and uh,

1981
02:00:00.760 --> 02:00:03.930
I just love how they fuck up sayings.

1982
02:00:06.140 --> 02:00:11.020
W Snookie said she was upset about something and said that her blood pressure

1983
02:00:11.290 --> 02:00:15.790
was off the roof.
My blood pressure's off the roof,

1984
02:00:16.510 --> 02:00:21.220
not going through the roof,
not off the charts.
It was off the roof.

1985
02:00:23.800 --> 02:00:28.630
God bless that big titted fucking you don't,
she's going to be a great mother.

1986
02:00:28.720 --> 02:00:31.960
I don't know what it is about her.
She's going to be a great mother,
but she,
she,

1987
02:00:32.110 --> 02:00:36.940
I don't know if she's ever going to get married because so much footage exists

1988
02:00:37.810 --> 02:00:38.710
of a,

1989
02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:42.400
I don't even know if a lot of footage exists cause I didn't really watch it this

1990
02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:45.070
year,
this season.
But you know,

1991
02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:47.500
once you do like a fucking whatever that,

1992
02:00:47.501 --> 02:00:51.550
that backwards cartwheel that you did and they have to pixelate your pussy lips

1993
02:00:51.551 --> 02:00:54.070
hanging out of your fucking Thong.
I mean that,

1994
02:00:54.071 --> 02:00:57.100
that you're really limiting the amount of people that are going to want to go

1995
02:00:57.101 --> 02:01:00.520
out on a date with you.
Something that she continues to,
to,
uh,
to bit your Bob,

1996
02:01:01.660 --> 02:01:05.560
you know,
her tits take up your entire torso.

1997
02:01:05.561 --> 02:01:08.740
If you notice that they start right under her,
Adam,
the Adam's apple,

1998
02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.100
and they go right to the top of where her pubes grow,

1999
02:01:13.100 --> 02:01:14.740
which is another thing that's working against her.

2000
02:01:14.741 --> 02:01:16.330
But you gotta admit she's got a lot of talent.

2001
02:01:17.110 --> 02:01:19.960
Her ability to do that back flip in,
not like

2002
02:01:21.790 --> 02:01:23.830
what are those fucking things?
One of those weebles wobble,

2003
02:01:23.831 --> 02:01:25.630
but they don't fall down at some point like that.

2004
02:01:25.631 --> 02:01:30.280
That should be like impossible for her to do.
Oh,
Jesus Christ.

2005
02:01:30.281 --> 02:01:33.670
What am I talking about this week?
Um,
yeah,
so the fucking patriots won.

2006
02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:37.060
I think we're one of the weakest five and one goddamn teams out there,

2007
02:01:38.110 --> 02:01:42.680
but we're five and one tied with the Goddamn jets.
What do you think about debt?

2008
02:01:42.681 --> 02:01:46.250
You Green,
bald fucking cunts.
Um,

2009
02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:50.600
anyways,
oh,
this week,
by the way,
let me hype some,
uh,

2010
02:01:50.601 --> 02:01:55.310
some of the shit I got going on.
I have a,
I'm going to be going to,

2011
02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:57.710
um,
Saint Louis this weekend.

2012
02:01:57.711 --> 02:02:02.120
I'm doing a benefit on Friday night and on Saturday night I'm doing two shows

2013
02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:05.270
one night only at the funny bone of Saint Louis.
I haven't been here.

2014
02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:09.710
I haven't been there in a,
put it this way.

2015
02:02:09.740 --> 02:02:13.310
The last time I went there was the first year of new Busch Stadium,

2016
02:02:14.300 --> 02:02:18.930
I believe.
Yeah.
Whenever the fuck that was.
It's,

2017
02:02:18.931 --> 02:02:21.920
it's been a good five,
six years.
I want to say,
I don't know.

2018
02:02:21.921 --> 02:02:25.370
I spent a long goddamn time so please come out to that show.

2019
02:02:25.371 --> 02:02:30.371
I will have my new DVDs for sale and I can't stress how much you're going to be

2020
02:02:31.761 --> 02:02:36.350
happy if you buy that goddamn thing because comedy central,

2021
02:02:36.650 --> 02:02:41.390
because they actually make their money through advertising,
had not their fault,

2022
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:46.420
had to cut out 16 minutes of that special plus an extra five minutes because his

2023
02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:48.740
special is an hour and five minutes long.

2024
02:02:48.920 --> 02:02:51.950
So with the 16 minutes of commercials plus the extra five minutes,

2025
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:55.820
21 minutes of that special you have not seen.

2026
02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.950
And the overwhelming response I've gotten from people was like,

2027
02:03:00.951 --> 02:03:03.290
Holy Shit,
I can't believe they cut out all this stuff.

2028
02:03:03.320 --> 02:03:04.580
I mean I get why they did it.

2029
02:03:04.581 --> 02:03:08.180
I wish they showed it over 90 minutes and you could see the whole special,

2030
02:03:08.690 --> 02:03:10.640
but um,
you won't be disappointed.

2031
02:03:10.790 --> 02:03:14.060
And I have extras actually filmed one of my Monday morning podcasts.

2032
02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:17.360
If you're ever curious to see what I look like sitting in sweatpants,

2033
02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:20.840
talking into a mic by myself.
We've got that footage.

2034
02:03:20.841 --> 02:03:25.580
And some footage of me getting heckled and giving people shit back.
All right,

2035
02:03:25.970 --> 02:03:29.930
so that is it.
And I'm hanging around to go to the fucking rams game,

2036
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:31.071
the rams game,

2037
02:03:31.071 --> 02:03:36.071
which will be my 101st professional franchise that I have been to,

2038
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:41.960
uh,
trying to go to all 123.
And this,
this week I actually,

2039
02:03:41.961 --> 02:03:45.200
when I was on the plane,
this is how I'm,
I try to,
uh,

2040
02:03:45.230 --> 02:03:48.920
kill time when I'm on the plane is uh,

2041
02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:55.550
I don't know.
I,
I try to,
if I write down the,
the teams that I haven't seen,

2042
02:03:56.030 --> 02:04:00.380
this is really psycho and I'll do it with my right hand cause I'm a lefty,
right?

2043
02:04:00.750 --> 02:04:03.800
Trying to develop that skill because I feel like my brain's turning to mush

2044
02:04:03.801 --> 02:04:08.540
talking on cell phones.
And uh,
this week I actually,

2045
02:04:09.380 --> 02:04:09.681
and I'm,

2046
02:04:09.681 --> 02:04:12.800
well I'm going to complete this list and put it up on the [inaudible] podcast.

2047
02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:14.960
I actually,
um,

2048
02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:20.300
started to compile a list of the names of all the stadiums that I've been to.

2049
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:23.090
And a,
I got to admit,
it's pretty,

2050
02:04:23.091 --> 02:04:25.220
it's getting pretty fucking impressive at this point.

2051
02:04:25.940 --> 02:04:27.680
Some of the classics that I've been to,

2052
02:04:27.681 --> 02:04:29.810
some of the ones that aren't there anymore,

2053
02:04:31.160 --> 02:04:35.930
like Old Tiger Stadium,
old Yankee stadium.
Uh,

2054
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:38.550
and even like the random ones,
like county stadium.

2055
02:04:38.970 --> 02:04:42.510
I remember that one with like the brewers back in the day when they used to hit

2056
02:04:42.511 --> 02:04:45.000
home runs,
every time they hit a home run,

2057
02:04:45.001 --> 02:04:50.001
they had this big fucking tinted whore would slide down into a slide into what

2058
02:04:51.811 --> 02:04:55.500
was supposed to be an old school keg of beer,
you know,

2059
02:04:56.400 --> 02:05:01.350
I dunno.
So good God damn time.
Um,
so I'll have that list up there.
Seriously,

2060
02:05:01.351 --> 02:05:03.660
if you ever sports nerd,
if you don't,
if you don't,
if you're not into it,

2061
02:05:03.661 --> 02:05:06.570
who gives a fuck?
Um,
all right.

2062
02:05:06.571 --> 02:05:10.320
This podcast is grinding to a God damn halt.
All right,

2063
02:05:10.321 --> 02:05:12.240
let's get to some advice here.
Bill.

2064
02:05:12.241 --> 02:05:15.720
I met a girl on a online dating site and uh,

2065
02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:20.850
we hit it off and we both thought each other
as friends.

2066
02:05:21.360 --> 02:05:25.770
Now,
you know,
usually I,
I blame myself when I,
when I don't read these well,

2067
02:05:25.771 --> 02:05:27.970
but this,
this one is really not written well.

2068
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:32.400
He misses words and he misspells the,
the rest of them.

2069
02:05:32.401 --> 02:05:34.950
So just bear with me.
All right.
So basically this guy,

2070
02:05:34.951 --> 02:05:37.170
I met this girl on an online dating site.

2071
02:05:37.171 --> 02:05:41.490
They hit it off and they both think of each other as friends while over the last

2072
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:44.010
nine months,
we became good friends.

2073
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:47.730
Even after I moved eight hours,

2074
02:05:49.170 --> 02:05:52.660
eight hours days,
you mean eight hours away.
Oh,

2075
02:05:52.661 --> 02:05:55.380
you got a job and you're working eight hour days.
I have no idea.

2076
02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:58.260
During the last three months,
um,

2077
02:05:59.670 --> 02:06:02.610
she lost or last 25 pounds,

2078
02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:05.670
lost 25 pounds and told me,
uh,

2079
02:06:05.671 --> 02:06:08.850
she was bipolar and old geesh.

2080
02:06:09.900 --> 02:06:14.490
Jesus Christ dude.
Okay.
And over this time she keeps calling

2081
02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:22.080
and started treating me like a boyfriend.
So obviously you're fucking are.

2082
02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.110
Okay.
So you're,

2083
02:06:25.111 --> 02:06:28.560
you're hanging out with this girl for eight months and you're banging her.

2084
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:31.380
So yeah,
she's going to start treating you like a boyfriend.

2085
02:06:31.740 --> 02:06:36.150
A few weeks ago I was invited to her family's beach house for the weekend and

2086
02:06:36.151 --> 02:06:39.660
met her whole family.
While I was there,

2087
02:06:39.810 --> 02:06:43.370
her mother introduced me to their family and friends as the guide.

2088
02:06:43.860 --> 02:06:47.550
Jane has been dating for the last four months.
I blew it off.

2089
02:06:48.060 --> 02:06:51.420
Why would you blow that off?
I guess her mother could,
you know,

2090
02:06:51.860 --> 02:06:55.890
was just trying to save her a daughter's reputation.
Hey,

2091
02:06:55.891 --> 02:07:00.000
this is my daughter's a friend friend with benefits.
Yeah,
he's banging her,

2092
02:07:00.001 --> 02:07:03.630
but there's really nothing going on here.
Oh,
these kids today.

2093
02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:09.300
Um,
I blew it off and enjoyed the weekend,
uh,
three weeks ago.
It's,
um,

2094
02:07:09.420 --> 02:07:13.320
it's gotten really bad and I'm trying to distance myself.

2095
02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:18.680
And the other night I asked her if she thought of me more than a friend and she

2096
02:07:19.291 --> 02:07:20.190
said no.

2097
02:07:20.450 --> 02:07:24.450
And it gave me the friend speech and then as why I felt that she might have felt

2098
02:07:24.451 --> 02:07:27.630
this way and gave me some examples about calling me.

2099
02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:30.720
Oh.

2100
02:07:30.720 --> 02:07:35.290
And then she gave you some examples about calling her all the time and telling a

2101
02:07:35.291 --> 02:07:37.480
few other personal things.
Well,

2102
02:07:37.481 --> 02:07:40.900
two days later she called me and said that she can't be friends with me anymore

2103
02:07:41.080 --> 02:07:44.250
because every time we talk or hang out together,
uh,

2104
02:07:44.251 --> 02:07:48.940
it gets tougher because she's always going to think that she,
she's giving you,

2105
02:07:49.360 --> 02:07:52.150
she's giving.
Oh,
giving you the,

2106
02:07:52.151 --> 02:07:56.140
I like you more than a friend vibe.
Um,

2107
02:07:56.170 --> 02:08:01.170
I feel really bad and that what I said might have caused her to have a major

2108
02:08:02.471 --> 02:08:07.360
episode.
What,
like bipolar episode.
And we talked so much,

2109
02:08:07.361 --> 02:08:12.361
I didn't really realize how much of a part of a life my life she was and I did

2110
02:08:12.611 --> 02:08:15.700
have feelings for what do I do?
All right.

2111
02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:17.650
First things first.

2112
02:08:17.651 --> 02:08:21.820
This is why that friends with benefit thing doesn't work for so many people.

2113
02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.640
Because friends with benefits,

2114
02:08:27.370 --> 02:08:30.160
if you're hanging out with someone of the opposite sex,

2115
02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:32.650
they're going to start getting feelings for you.

2116
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:37.060
So the only way to do the friends with benefit things is you can only,

2117
02:08:38.320 --> 02:08:40.130
you can only bang them and,

2118
02:08:40.250 --> 02:08:44.260
but what you have to do is there has to be a significant period of time

2119
02:08:46.060 --> 02:08:50.890
between you.
You banging that you bang them and then you fucking leave.

2120
02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:54.490
But inevitably something like this,
someone's going to get,

2121
02:08:54.491 --> 02:08:58.030
get some feelings and it's,
it's an impossible thing to do.

2122
02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:03.780
It's like what you're doing is you had a one night stand and you,

2123
02:09:03.790 --> 02:09:08.790
you are either through being selfish or just lacking the confidence of you being

2124
02:09:09.071 --> 02:09:13.530
able to pull off,
getting laid again.
You try to keep them,

2125
02:09:13.550 --> 02:09:15.760
I can only speak of this from the male side.

2126
02:09:15.860 --> 02:09:20.350
You try to keep this person in your fucking,
uh,

2127
02:09:20.470 --> 02:09:25.180
in a holding pattern around your life and uh,
yeah,

2128
02:09:25.181 --> 02:09:26.890
of course she's going to end up catching some feelings.

2129
02:09:26.890 --> 02:09:28.570
You're going to end up hurting the person.
You can't.

2130
02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:31.150
You mean if you're just friends,

2131
02:09:31.151 --> 02:09:34.750
what the fuck he going over meeting her parents for?
You know,

2132
02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:39.100
like that level is shit.
No matter how much you've said from the get go,

2133
02:09:39.310 --> 02:09:41.500
that look,
I don't want anything more than this.
We just,

2134
02:09:41.530 --> 02:09:42.760
I just view you as a friend.

2135
02:09:42.761 --> 02:09:46.810
If you go over and you meet her parents like that says something.

2136
02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:52.540
All right.
So my advice is,
is if you like this girl,

2137
02:09:52.750 --> 02:09:56.320
make her your girlfriend.
If you don't like her,

2138
02:09:56.410 --> 02:10:01.390
stop fucking her because you're hurting her.
You know,

2139
02:10:01.750 --> 02:10:05.020
that's all you're doing is because she's going to forget about the fact that she

2140
02:10:05.021 --> 02:10:09.520
has these,
these,
this by bipolar disorder or whatever.
Now obviously,

2141
02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:13.000
I don't know how that fucking plays into it.
Um,

2142
02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:15.131
but yeah,
dude,

2143
02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:19.900
you gotta you gotta man up and have the balls to either make this girl your

2144
02:10:19.901 --> 02:10:23.080
girlfriend or man up and just be alone,

2145
02:10:23.530 --> 02:10:25.330
which is how most people,

2146
02:10:25.331 --> 02:10:30.100
I think fuck up their dating careers and getting married and all that is just,

2147
02:10:30.101 --> 02:10:35.060
they have a fear of being alone and they don't want to,
uh,

2148
02:10:35.630 --> 02:10:39.650
just ride out that fucking six weeks.
You know,

2149
02:10:39.651 --> 02:10:43.010
going through the first few days of spooning with your pillow and crying and

2150
02:10:43.011 --> 02:10:47.630
feeling sorry for yourself and just learning how to pick yourself up off the
mat.

2151
02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:51.470
Join a gym,
right?
Get yourself in shape,

2152
02:10:52.430 --> 02:10:56.870
hang out with the fellas,
watch some games.
You know,
it's only

2153
02:10:58.910 --> 02:11:03.290
being single,
really just,
it sucks on days off and it's sucks at night.

2154
02:11:03.320 --> 02:11:06.980
But other than that,
it's a,
it's pretty fucking awesome,

2155
02:11:08.270 --> 02:11:13.250
you know,
to just kind of be able to walk into places,

2156
02:11:14.270 --> 02:11:18.140
scope out every chick there and be like,
I want to try to fuck her.

2157
02:11:18.170 --> 02:11:20.540
Or maybe that's the girl I want to marry like that.

2158
02:11:20.600 --> 02:11:23.840
That's a great situation to be in,
in.

2159
02:11:23.990 --> 02:11:28.850
It's worth the loneliness.
Come on,
be honest with me.

2160
02:11:28.851 --> 02:11:32.120
How many people out there are fucking with somebody right now you don't want to

2161
02:11:32.121 --> 02:11:35.930
be with.
And you go into these family fucking advance.

2162
02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:39.650
You know when you just feel the new skit and tighter and tighter around your

2163
02:11:39.651 --> 02:11:44.600
neck.
I'm telling you,
just get out of it.
And when you get out of it,

2164
02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:49.280
go through the pain of being single on,
of,
of going through the breakup.

2165
02:11:49.730 --> 02:11:52.040
Don't just go out and run back to the person.

2166
02:11:52.041 --> 02:11:57.041
Don't fucking go out and just start dating somebody else and just use that

2167
02:11:57.231 --> 02:12:00.080
person to fill up your fucking loneliness.

2168
02:12:01.010 --> 02:12:05.540
Like really just be alone.
And when you,

2169
02:12:05.541 --> 02:12:08.420
you know,
I'm telling you I have to fucking couple of weeks,

2170
02:12:08.421 --> 02:12:11.150
you're going to get through it and then

2171
02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.400
you'll be comfortable being by yourself and then you can have a quiet fucking

2172
02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:20.450
mind that isn't thinking panic thoughts and he can just kind of make a list of

2173
02:12:20.451 --> 02:12:24.950
what the fuck you looking for,
you know,
and ask for if you don't know what to,

2174
02:12:24.951 --> 02:12:29.450
where to find it as for some goddamn advice.
But the last thing you do is,

2175
02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:34.190
uh,
is,
is getting involved in a situation like this where it's like,
dude,

2176
02:12:34.670 --> 02:12:36.530
if you really gave a fuck about this girl,

2177
02:12:37.490 --> 02:12:41.190
wouldn't when you made her your girl or maybe you're afraid to make her,
her,

2178
02:12:41.210 --> 02:12:45.200
your girlfriend.
I don't know what.
But,
uh,
that's my advice.

2179
02:12:45.201 --> 02:12:46.160
I would do one or the other,

2180
02:12:46.161 --> 02:12:50.480
actually commit to this girl and try to make it happen.
Um,

2181
02:12:50.810 --> 02:12:53.030
or just get away from her.
All right?

2182
02:12:53.930 --> 02:12:58.010
But I gotta admit you're really taken on a hell of a fucking thing here where

2183
02:12:58.090 --> 02:13:03.080
you've got someone with a bipolar disorder.
You know,

2184
02:13:03.200 --> 02:13:04.100
and I hate to say it,

2185
02:13:04.101 --> 02:13:07.970
but you have to be selfish when you're picking a mate and it says that something

2186
02:13:07.971 --> 02:13:11.840
you want to fucking deal with except something you feel you're capable of

2187
02:13:11.841 --> 02:13:12.291
dealing with.

2188
02:13:12.291 --> 02:13:17.030
This is the shit you have to ask yourself when you sit in there alone,
you know,

2189
02:13:17.990 --> 02:13:21.130
eaten Doritos with one hand down the front of your fucking sweat pants.

2190
02:13:22.900 --> 02:13:27.320
All right,
there you go.
I think a lot of that made a little bit of sense.

2191
02:13:27.321 --> 02:13:30.580
God dammit.
Somebody sent me a picture the other day,
this guy at a,

2192
02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:34.710
a pickup truck and on the back he had all this shit.

2193
02:13:36.030 --> 02:13:39.990
Um,
Anti Obama,
Obama's Asa,
his name,
Obama.

2194
02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:42.770
And uh,
at one point he had this,
uh,

2195
02:13:42.830 --> 02:13:47.830
this is what fascinates me about people who are straight up Democrat or straight

2196
02:13:48.961 --> 02:13:49.794
up Republican.

2197
02:13:50.430 --> 02:13:54.120
It reminds me of people who are into like fucking organized religion,

2198
02:13:54.210 --> 02:13:57.990
just like the blinders that they have on this is the bumper sticker.

2199
02:13:57.991 --> 02:14:01.920
This guy hit had he said,
recession,
your neighbor loses his job,

2200
02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:05.940
depression,
you lose your job recovery.

2201
02:14:06.120 --> 02:14:09.990
Obama loses his job,
you know,

2202
02:14:10.170 --> 02:14:14.550
and it's just like,
that was fucking people.
It's like,

2203
02:14:14.610 --> 02:14:19.610
how do you not see that they all kind of do the same thing and they're all on

2204
02:14:19.831 --> 02:14:22.830
their knees blowing the same fucking,

2205
02:14:24.810 --> 02:14:29.760
I mean,
don't you see?
Okay,
Clinton,
Democrat,
liberal,
right?
Bleeding,

2206
02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:32.550
heart liberal.
What does he do?
The bleeding,
heart liberal.

2207
02:14:32.551 --> 02:14:34.980
He's for the fucking everyday Joe.

2208
02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:38.280
He's just going to give it away to the broke people.
What does he do?

2209
02:14:38.730 --> 02:14:43.710
He helps deregulate the banks.
All right.

2210
02:14:44.130 --> 02:14:46.770
George Bush comes in,
right?

2211
02:14:46.860 --> 02:14:50.490
He wants to help out fucking major corporations and all that type of shit.

2212
02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:53.400
Doesn't give them one war.
He gives him two wars

2213
02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:58.170
billion dollars a fucking month of whatever the hell it is going into those

2214
02:14:58.171 --> 02:15:01.530
fucking cunts pockets.
God,

2215
02:15:01.730 --> 02:15:03.870
in the combination of those two fucking moves,

2216
02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:08.430
that deregulation of banks trying to fight to fucking wars,
to away games.

2217
02:15:08.431 --> 02:15:10.440
By the way,
on the other side of the fucking planet,

2218
02:15:11.340 --> 02:15:15.600
bankrupts this goddamn country.
Obama comes in,
right?

2219
02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.820
Bleeding,
heart,
fucking liberal.
What the fuck does he do?
He

2220
02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:25.710
gets us out of Iraq and then escalates to shit in Afghanistan.

2221
02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:30.990
Has he taken any of these bankers to task?
They stole a trillion dollars.

2222
02:15:30.991 --> 02:15:33.090
They can't even say the way the fuck it is or who got it.

2223
02:15:33.091 --> 02:15:34.860
Is he going after those people?

2224
02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:40.320
Now they're not.
It's the same fucking people.

2225
02:15:40.530 --> 02:15:45.530
Which is why I resent people when they tell me when I vote for Ron Paul arranged

2226
02:15:46.650 --> 02:15:48.840
or anybody else,
you know,

2227
02:15:49.050 --> 02:15:53.490
light of that ilk who saying that these bankers in these corporations are

2228
02:15:53.491 --> 02:15:58.050
completely out of fucking control and we need to do audit the Federal Reserve or

2229
02:15:58.051 --> 02:16:01.840
maybe even close the,
you know,
shut the fucking thing down and they,

2230
02:16:01.841 --> 02:16:04.980
they're not allowed to debate and they're just considered a crazy person.

2231
02:16:05.700 --> 02:16:09.330
And then you go out there and you basically make a decision between the two

2232
02:16:09.331 --> 02:16:12.780
fucking guys that they're giving you to vote for,

2233
02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:17.220
that you feel like,
oh,
we made these choices.
You didn't,

2234
02:16:18.150 --> 02:16:21.900
you didn't.
It's all the same fucking guy.
Hi.

2235
02:16:21.990 --> 02:16:26.610
He didn't figure that out in 2004 when your choice was two white guys who both

2236
02:16:26.611 --> 02:16:30.580
went to Yale,
who were both a member of that,
that fucking group,
the,

2237
02:16:30.581 --> 02:16:34.300
the skulls or whatever was the same fucking guy.

2238
02:16:36.880 --> 02:16:40.710
And I love how these fucking Democrats somehow get,
get off a guy,

2239
02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:44.620
get away with being like a,
you know,
they're all like millionaires.

2240
02:16:45.100 --> 02:16:47.890
Like John Kerry was a fucking Goddamn millionairey rate.

2241
02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:52.240
Somehow he's going to be a man of the people.
I don't fucking know.
I think,

2242
02:16:52.330 --> 02:16:53.110
I think,
uh,

2243
02:16:53.110 --> 02:16:58.110
I think at a lower level I think you can actually affect change,

2244
02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:03.160
um,
in political office.

2245
02:17:03.161 --> 02:17:06.100
But I think once you go past a certain level,

2246
02:17:06.310 --> 02:17:10.570
I think when even when you get to like,
if you were like a senator of your state,

2247
02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:15.490
I don't,
I just don't feel
that,
you know,

2248
02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.810
I dunno.
I think Obama said a bunch of shit that he was going to do,

2249
02:17:20.020 --> 02:17:22.360
got into office,
saw how shit works.

2250
02:17:22.390 --> 02:17:25.930
And right now he's trying to prevent getting shot in the fucking head.

2251
02:17:26.200 --> 02:17:29.050
Like everybody else who gets that job and you just,

2252
02:17:29.051 --> 02:17:32.500
you just do what they want you to do.
That's my,
that's my fucking 2 cents.

2253
02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:35.500
But these fucking morons who will,

2254
02:17:35.650 --> 02:17:40.650
will come along and just sit there and blame the current president if there,

2255
02:17:41.830 --> 02:17:45.970
of course,
if they're not a member of their party,
it's just beyond me.

2256
02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:51.520
It's just fucking beyond me.
Like,
uh,
I dunno.
I Dunno.
But,
um,
uh,

2257
02:17:51.630 --> 02:17:53.190
but I,
like I said,
I feel like I've,

2258
02:17:53.191 --> 02:17:55.390
I've talked about that enough on this fucking podcast.

2259
02:17:55.630 --> 02:17:57.160
People are still coming at me,

2260
02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:00.760
not under say understanding what I'm saying about these,

2261
02:18:00.761 --> 02:18:05.110
these automated checkout machines at the grocery stores.
Once again,

2262
02:18:05.111 --> 02:18:10.111
this guy writes me like a five page fucking email talking about pulleys and

2263
02:18:11.921 --> 02:18:14.290
levers and inventions from back in time.

2264
02:18:14.291 --> 02:18:18.450
Like I'm against fucking,
uh,
um,

2265
02:18:19.180 --> 02:18:24.100
progress
and he's comparing all of this.
Like,
I'm sitting there going,

2266
02:18:24.101 --> 02:18:27.400
fuck airplanes.
We should be back riding horses.

2267
02:18:28.930 --> 02:18:31.840
What about all the Black Smith who got put out of business?

2268
02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:33.310
I'm not talking about that.

2269
02:18:34.240 --> 02:18:38.590
I don't want to ride a horse to a Gig in fucking Philly.
I don't want to do that.

2270
02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:41.290
I love airplanes.
I don't have a problem with that shit.

2271
02:18:41.710 --> 02:18:45.190
I'm not talking about progress.

2272
02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:49.510
I'm talking about something
that,

2273
02:18:49.511 --> 02:18:52.990
that makes me have to work for somebody for free.

2274
02:18:54.190 --> 02:18:57.310
That's what I'm saying.
All right.

2275
02:18:57.370 --> 02:19:01.330
If they came out with those automated checkout machines and it got rid of

2276
02:19:01.331 --> 02:19:03.460
people's fucking jobs and,
but,

2277
02:19:03.530 --> 02:19:06.490
but I walked up there and it was like this thing that just,

2278
02:19:06.880 --> 02:19:11.880
just magically could tell me what I fucking owed without me having to do the

2279
02:19:13.031 --> 02:19:17.170
actual fucking job that the other person was just doing.

2280
02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:20.920
I wouldn't have a problem with it,
but those fucking check that they're just,

2281
02:19:20.950 --> 02:19:22.210
all they did was turn the cash,

2282
02:19:22.211 --> 02:19:26.380
register around and now I have to do it and bag my own shit.

2283
02:19:26.470 --> 02:19:28.220
How the is that progress?

2284
02:19:29.750 --> 02:19:34.430
Somebody else was trying to tell me that it's all part of this movement of,

2285
02:19:34.460 --> 02:19:38.660
of it was really,
really a spiritual thing.
So that we'll have all these robots,

2286
02:19:38.990 --> 02:19:42.140
man,
and they'll be doing all these jobs and then life will just be all about,

2287
02:19:42.470 --> 02:19:47.390
you know,
just exploring life cause you won't have to do a fucking job.

2288
02:19:47.391 --> 02:19:51.740
It's just like,
it's like,
dude,
you're completely ignoring

2289
02:19:53.690 --> 02:19:57.170
sociopath's
all right.

2290
02:19:57.230 --> 02:20:00.680
Which is why like when,
when,
uh,
as much as I lean left,

2291
02:20:00.681 --> 02:20:05.330
I don't go all the way to the left because that's the big flaw in,
in,

2292
02:20:05.331 --> 02:20:08.000
in us psycho level of,

2293
02:20:08.001 --> 02:20:13.001
of liberal thought is you completely ignore sociopath.

2294
02:20:15.050 --> 02:20:19.910
If everybody was nice,
everybody,
everything would be nice.
No it wouldn't.

2295
02:20:20.720 --> 02:20:24.740
They'd still be Charlie Manson.
It still be those guys,

2296
02:20:24.830 --> 02:20:27.710
they'd still be that guy who couldn't handle,

2297
02:20:29.210 --> 02:20:32.180
not fucking having more than somebody else there couldn't,

2298
02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:36.440
did the or the person who can't feel anything unless he's fucking poke in the

2299
02:20:36.441 --> 02:20:40.090
eyes of a squirrel out.
So I don't know.
My,
my,

2300
02:20:40.091 --> 02:20:43.460
my theory has always been that fucking hasn't always been that way.

2301
02:20:43.461 --> 02:20:45.800
Just just through the fucked up shit that I've read.

2302
02:20:45.801 --> 02:20:47.120
And God knows if it's even right,

2303
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:50.870
is that sociopath's basically run the fucking world.

2304
02:20:52.010 --> 02:20:52.843
You know,

2305
02:20:53.420 --> 02:20:57.020
they have the balls to just go out and take,

2306
02:20:57.410 --> 02:21:01.760
and they have the,
the,
I don't know if it's a chemical makeup,

2307
02:21:01.761 --> 02:21:06.320
psychological makeup,
whatever it is to feel absolutely no fucking guilt.

2308
02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:11.000
They could give a fuck about other human beings.

2309
02:21:11.001 --> 02:21:14.690
They could give a fuck about nature.
They could give,
they could give a fuck.

2310
02:21:15.770 --> 02:21:20.360
They could give a fuck.
So
Jesus Christ,
I was so,

2311
02:21:20.361 --> 02:21:21.800
I'm so on my God damn soapbox.

2312
02:21:21.801 --> 02:21:23.550
I don't even know what the fuck I was talking about.
Oh,

2313
02:21:23.810 --> 02:21:28.160
getting back to that shit.
So that is my,
my,
I don't have a problem with ATS.
Okay.

2314
02:21:28.250 --> 02:21:31.010
Htms I basically became my own fucking teller.

2315
02:21:31.011 --> 02:21:34.130
But here's the big difference is I then had access to my money.

2316
02:21:34.250 --> 02:21:37.070
24 fucking seven you gave me a little something.

2317
02:21:37.220 --> 02:21:38.810
I don't have a fucking problem with that,

2318
02:21:39.740 --> 02:21:43.940
but I walk into a grocery store and now I'm standing behind a fucking plumber

2319
02:21:44.240 --> 02:21:48.110
trying to scan a week's worth to God damn groceries.
It's not quicker.

2320
02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:53.550
It's not.
It's,
it sucks.
Fuck you.
I,

2321
02:21:53.760 --> 02:21:57.740
I can't stop sending me fucking emails about pulleys and levers.

2322
02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:02.120
Jesus fucking Christ.
The advantage of the wheel.

2323
02:22:02.450 --> 02:22:05.780
He's fucking 30 fucking 40 PC.
Ugh.

2324
02:22:06.920 --> 02:22:11.720
Kill yourselves.
All right,

2325
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:14.690
my recorder cut out again.
And it wasn't a batteries this time.

2326
02:22:14.990 --> 02:22:19.760
The memory was full on it or if you're of the spiritual ilk,

2327
02:22:20.000 --> 02:22:23.630
I think it was the podcast.
God's telling me to stop being so fucking preachy.

2328
02:22:25.130 --> 02:22:28.020
Um,
fuck the podcast gods.
All right.

2329
02:22:28.830 --> 02:22:33.490
I'm not working for fucking free.
I'm not doing that.
Those goddamn automated uh,

2330
02:22:34.100 --> 02:22:37.410
uh,
um,
things there when you,
when you go into a parking garage,

2331
02:22:37.470 --> 02:22:40.740
now we've got to stand in two fucking lines.
I got to stand behind.

2332
02:22:40.741 --> 02:22:44.070
Somebody tried to stuff their crinkled up dollar bill in trying to pay for their

2333
02:22:44.071 --> 02:22:46.710
parking and then I got to dry,
you know,

2334
02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:51.300
then I drive down waiting to leave and they don't get to just fucking leave

2335
02:22:51.301 --> 02:22:52.920
cause they gotta make sure they paid it.

2336
02:22:52.921 --> 02:22:56.550
They all you did was create an extra line and you eliminated the fucking parking

2337
02:22:56.551 --> 02:22:59.500
garage guy and now I've got to sit there and wait for the person that,

2338
02:22:59.550 --> 02:23:04.170
oh wait a fuck did they put the ticket that said I paid twice as God damn long.

2339
02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:07.680
That's what I'm talking about.
Pulley and lever guy.

2340
02:23:07.890 --> 02:23:09.120
That's what I'm talking about.

2341
02:23:09.210 --> 02:23:13.290
I'm talking about inventions that do not make my life easier.

2342
02:23:13.291 --> 02:23:15.600
They just make me work for fucking free.

2343
02:23:16.530 --> 02:23:20.700
And the time that I spend in the store is not any shorter and a lot of times

2344
02:23:20.701 --> 02:23:24.930
it's a little bit fucking longer.
That's what I'm talking about,
sir.

2345
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:29.700
All right,
here's a reference to last week I brought up chipped beef on toast.

2346
02:23:29.730 --> 02:23:33.360
Somebody from the military let me know that that's actually known as shit on a

2347
02:23:33.361 --> 02:23:37.770
shingle.
Um,
another here's another classic white trash meal that I had.

2348
02:23:37.771 --> 02:23:38.820
You guys ever have chicken.

2349
02:23:39.030 --> 02:23:43.710
I'll king that was like sort of chipped beef on toast without the chips of beef.

2350
02:23:44.640 --> 02:23:49.410
Another classic white trash meal that I had most white trash meal.

2351
02:23:49.411 --> 02:23:54.411
What it involves is some sort of sludge put on bread because all it is it when

2352
02:23:55.411 --> 02:23:57.120
it's real,
it's not about nutrition.

2353
02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:00.210
What it's about is taking away the pain of hunger.

2354
02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:02.290
And I mean,

2355
02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:06.720
you could literally wallpaper a room using chicken,

2356
02:24:06.980 --> 02:24:11.110
Allah king as your wallpaper paste.
That's how disgusting that Shit was.
Um,

2357
02:24:12.060 --> 02:24:15.930
I don't even know what it was mixed with.
It was sort of this gray.

2358
02:24:18.030 --> 02:24:21.570
I'm not quite liquid,
not quite solid.

2359
02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:27.540
It was like a great,
and then,
uh,
I got overly thick fucking gravy.

2360
02:24:28.650 --> 02:24:31.160
I mean,
it's one of those,
do you remember that when you took,
uh,

2361
02:24:31.380 --> 02:24:33.300
not to gross people out?
Cause this is really,
you know,

2362
02:24:33.330 --> 02:24:36.270
getting kind of gross here when,
when you would open the can of chicken,

2363
02:24:36.870 --> 02:24:41.520
Alec King and you would turn it over,
it would sort of slide out.

2364
02:24:41.521 --> 02:24:44.590
It would just be,
and before it finally just dropped down on the play to be,

2365
02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:49.470
and then there was like that,
that,

2366
02:24:49.471 --> 02:24:53.790
that sort of transparent gelatinous shit on the bottom of it.

2367
02:24:53.790 --> 02:24:56.970
It was just was fucking,
that's disgusting.

2368
02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:02.280
Yet somehow we weren't obese.
His kids,
it's because we were outside playing.

2369
02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:04.580
I think they're gradually do want to go thing with that,

2370
02:25:04.581 --> 02:25:06.900
with those video games now will ever,
if you play soccer now,

2371
02:25:06.901 --> 02:25:10.560
you actually got to sit there swinging your leg around and running and stuff.

2372
02:25:10.561 --> 02:25:15.540
I mean,
I guess,
uh,
I guess that's a good thing.
Right?
All right,
let's plow ahead.

2373
02:25:15.541 --> 02:25:17.730
Bill.
Uh,
he actually,
I got a thank you letter,

2374
02:25:17.790 --> 02:25:21.390
which is always nice because ever since I started talking about sports,

2375
02:25:21.391 --> 02:25:25.960
the level of fucking anger has really been ramped up on the,
uh,

2376
02:25:25.961 --> 02:25:30.340
on the emails to the point that I'm taking everything in a defensive way.

2377
02:25:30.341 --> 02:25:33.490
Like somebody actually sent me a hilarious email and I didn't even get it.

2378
02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:36.070
They said,
Bill,
once you started talking,

2379
02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:40.900
once you started defending bill O'Reilly last week on the podcast,
I shut,

2380
02:25:40.930 --> 02:25:45.930
I walked away from my recorder and I'm waiting for an apology and I was so like

2381
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:53.070
read like five emails in a row of getting trashed that I wrote back.

2382
02:25:54.160 --> 02:25:56.410
Well,
why don't you go back and listen to what I said about,

2383
02:25:56.510 --> 02:25:59.860
I didn't even get the fucking joke,
the obvious joke.

2384
02:25:59.890 --> 02:26:01.780
They got up and walked off the view.

2385
02:26:02.350 --> 02:26:04.750
So my apology to that person I just had written,

2386
02:26:04.980 --> 02:26:08.410
I'd read like fucking five in a row where I was getting trashed.

2387
02:26:09.010 --> 02:26:12.440
So I was kind of in that mindset.
So my fault.
Um,
look at that.

2388
02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:16.660
The comedian not getting a fucking joke.
All right,
plowing ahead here.
Um,

2389
02:26:17.290 --> 02:26:20.830
thanks.
Here's actually something from thanks.
Yo,
Bill,
what's up?
My name is,
uh,

2390
02:26:20.850 --> 02:26:24.580
I can't see your name.
I'm from Little Rock,
Arkansas.
I'm 23 years old.

2391
02:26:24.581 --> 02:26:28.000
Sort of a new listener to the podcast.
Been a longtime fan of yours.
Uh,

2392
02:26:28.001 --> 02:26:32.830
but just a few months ago I discovered that you have a weekly podcasts.
Um,

2393
02:26:33.160 --> 02:26:37.030
anyways,
it's,
uh,
it's all great,
Yada Yada.
And anyways,
let's get to the point.

2394
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:38.860
I think it was,
uh,

2395
02:26:38.890 --> 02:26:43.890
maybe the second or third podcast of yours I had listened to and you were like

2396
02:26:44.231 --> 02:26:48.700
hung over I believe,
but you said something pretty goddamn outstanding,

2397
02:26:48.701 --> 02:26:52.600
at least to me.
At least to me.
It was Jesus Christ.

2398
02:26:52.601 --> 02:26:55.090
Can you guys please use capital letters and periods?
You know,

2399
02:26:55.091 --> 02:26:57.920
I can't read it out loud.
Um,

2400
02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:00.220
and he said it was great advice you gave me.

2401
02:27:00.221 --> 02:27:04.690
He said it was the day when you discovered what are loser really is or was the

2402
02:27:04.691 --> 02:27:06.580
definition of a loser.
Anyways,

2403
02:27:08.140 --> 02:27:11.980
he said the definition of a loser is someone who knows what they have to do,

2404
02:27:12.130 --> 02:27:16.630
but they always find some way to not do it.
And then he goes on to say,
man,

2405
02:27:16.631 --> 02:27:21.220
that shit was like so true to me because honestly,
I've been that guy for awhile.

2406
02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:22.850
It's weird.
Anyways,

2407
02:27:22.851 --> 02:27:26.920
so it was around the same time that school was about to start up for the fall

2408
02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:30.340
semester.
So of course it's that time of year where my family is looming over me.

2409
02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:35.260
Like,
what the fuck?
When are you going to,
uh,
get your life together?

2410
02:27:35.530 --> 02:27:40.240
Anyways,
when you said that,
I was like,
Whoa,
okay,

2411
02:27:40.270 --> 02:27:43.720
so fuck it.
I got up and went to the University of Arkansas,
Little Rock,

2412
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:46.630
found out what I needed to get done to get my ass back in class.

2413
02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.980
To make an already,
long story short,
I went out,
got my GED,

2414
02:27:50.230 --> 02:27:54.400
took the Goddamn Act test.
I don't even know what that is,
but he said,

2415
02:27:54.401 --> 02:27:57.910
which I failed miserably apparently.

2416
02:27:57.911 --> 02:28:01.390
So the school told me I had to take the compass test to get in.

2417
02:28:02.380 --> 02:28:03.250
Took that thing,

2418
02:28:03.430 --> 02:28:06.760
had to go through all the turmoil of finding my six year old high school

2419
02:28:06.761 --> 02:28:11.380
transcript,
which had been transferred to a billion places by then.

2420
02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:17.170
Um,
I wanted to say fuck it so bad during all of that crap,

2421
02:28:17.171 --> 02:28:21.160
but I kept repeating that shit through my head of what the definition of a loser

2422
02:28:21.470 --> 02:28:25.190
in any ways.
I'm halfway through my first semester as a freshman at

2423
02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.170
the University of UAA l are whatever that is.
And I have,
uh,

2424
02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:33.200
and I got a 98% of my midterm and I can honestly say,

2425
02:28:33.201 --> 02:28:35.600
if it wasn't for me listening to your podcast,

2426
02:28:36.290 --> 02:28:40.560
I'd still be ignoring that voice in my head.
Uh,

2427
02:28:40.940 --> 02:28:45.440
I'm sorry.
Still ignoring voicemails from my bitch,
grandmother,
Jesus,
dude,

2428
02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:49.730
trying to pes pester me into going to school.
She just wants what's best for you.

2429
02:28:51.290 --> 02:28:51.741
Um,
so anyways,

2430
02:28:51.741 --> 02:28:54.980
I want to say thanks and all that type of shit and don't be scared to tour the

2431
02:28:54.981 --> 02:28:58.850
south.
Me and my brother,
huge fucking fans.
And,
uh,

2432
02:28:58.910 --> 02:29:03.800
and he's about is Hank Williams as it gets.
Well,
that's good.
Look at that.
See,

2433
02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:07.010
other than pissing people off,
every once in a while I helped somebody else will.

2434
02:29:07.011 --> 02:29:10.760
Congratulations Dude.
Stick with that ship.
Where a condom.

2435
02:29:11.780 --> 02:29:15.860
That's the other one.
Respect yourself.
Where a goddamn condom.

2436
02:29:17.390 --> 02:29:17.660
Uh,

2437
02:29:17.660 --> 02:29:20.780
key and keep that fuck around until you know you're with the person you want to

2438
02:29:20.781 --> 02:29:21.231
marry,

2439
02:29:21.231 --> 02:29:25.220
then Merriam and be in a financial fucking position to bring somebody else into

2440
02:29:25.221 --> 02:29:28.880
the goddamn world.
Have a game plan.
Are you going to marry him?

2441
02:29:29.390 --> 02:29:33.410
Have the condom on while you're having that conversation.
All right.

2442
02:29:34.550 --> 02:29:38.330
Then have a fucking kid says the guy who's never had a fucking kid.

2443
02:29:38.331 --> 02:29:40.810
What the fuck do I know?
All right,
let's get to some questions and,
um,

2444
02:29:40.970 --> 02:29:45.910
some youtube videos and then I'm done.
Here we go.
Uh,
question.
Uh,

2445
02:29:45.970 --> 02:29:50.900
but,
but EPITDA right.
Send some money.

2446
02:29:50.901 --> 02:29:52.430
Morning podcast is rolling around.

2447
02:29:52.431 --> 02:29:55.040
I thought it'd be interesting if you rambled about this idea.

2448
02:29:55.370 --> 02:29:59.510
Maybe the question is more,
when do women deserve to enjoy sex?

2449
02:30:01.640 --> 02:30:05.630
Um,
um,
always.
Okay,

2450
02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:10.310
let's delve into this one.
Um,
recently it's their fucking sex life.

2451
02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:11.930
They can do whatever they want with it,
right?

2452
02:30:12.380 --> 02:30:16.100
I recently went to a mutually agreed upon dinner with a very motivated,

2453
02:30:16.101 --> 02:30:18.920
independent woman who expected me to pay for dinner.

2454
02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:25.070
What does a mutually agreed upon dinner?
Somebody had to ask somebody to dinner,

2455
02:30:25.071 --> 02:30:29.000
right?
I called bullshit and refused because as I told her,

2456
02:30:29.001 --> 02:30:31.370
I am not in the habit of paying for people's time,

2457
02:30:31.700 --> 02:30:36.700
especially not people I know to be manipulative and who absolutely don't have

2458
02:30:36.981 --> 02:30:41.570
sex before marriage.
All right,
dude,
right off the bat,

2459
02:30:42.290 --> 02:30:46.790
if you don't pay for people's time,
why would you go on sort of,

2460
02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:49.400
not a date,
but sort of a date with somebody that you know,

2461
02:30:49.401 --> 02:30:54.320
manipulates people and who doesn't have sex before marriage?
Uh,

2462
02:30:54.680 --> 02:30:59.000
is this so you could have this argument with this person?
I mean,

2463
02:30:59.510 --> 02:31:03.110
you sound like an intelligent guy.
You know where the fuck this is going?

2464
02:31:05.230 --> 02:31:06.440
Uh,
whatever.
I'll read the rest of this,

2465
02:31:06.441 --> 02:31:10.760
but this is one of these things he got to get out of this Rut.

2466
02:31:12.320 --> 02:31:15.890
This is,
there's not plenty of good women out there the same way.

2467
02:31:15.890 --> 02:31:17.990
There's not plenty of good men out there.
You've got to find them,

2468
02:31:18.320 --> 02:31:23.320
but you can't dating the same person that's going to keep reinforcing,

2469
02:31:24.630 --> 02:31:28.740
uh,
your thoughts or else you're going to end up like me,

2470
02:31:30.630 --> 02:31:34.110
which I'm not right now because I finally found someone who was awesome,
but,
uh,

2471
02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:35.363
you know,

2472
02:31:36.540 --> 02:31:41.540
half the shit that I call women on or is the shit that I see on TV and residual

2473
02:31:42.420 --> 02:31:46.770
baggage that I have from dating the same fucking psycho from year,

2474
02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:49.340
year after year.
Ah,
Jesus Christ,
I'm really on my soapbox.

2475
02:31:49.341 --> 02:31:52.320
I'm gonna shut the fuck up and read.
The rest is.
But more importantly I said,

2476
02:31:52.321 --> 02:31:56.580
what this woman failed to understand was how much she lowered herself and is

2477
02:31:56.581 --> 02:31:59.790
seen by saying I need a man to pay for my meals,

2478
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:03.240
which is all the same time bullshit.

2479
02:32:03.570 --> 02:32:06.330
The whole idea of the dating dynamic is really warped.

2480
02:32:06.730 --> 02:32:11.010
Where do you paying for if not sex,
you're paying for,
you're paying for sex.

2481
02:32:12.060 --> 02:32:14.160
What if you are paying for sex?
And I think women,

2482
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:19.680
the woman forfeits her rights to have fun in bed.
Oh,

2483
02:32:19.681 --> 02:32:20.640
I see what you're saying,

2484
02:32:20.910 --> 02:32:22.980
because you're really just paying for a service at that point.

2485
02:32:23.250 --> 02:32:28.230
And you know what you are making points because there are women who will go out

2486
02:32:28.231 --> 02:32:32.670
with a guy on a Friday night because they're kind of broke in there hungry.

2487
02:32:33.330 --> 02:32:34.163
You know,

2488
02:32:34.260 --> 02:32:39.210
you can't say that shit on TV because it's considered a misogynistic.

2489
02:32:40.080 --> 02:32:42.780
But you know,
if you're really fair about it,

2490
02:32:42.781 --> 02:32:46.680
women are just like guys that they get.
If you let them get away with it,

2491
02:32:46.681 --> 02:32:47.514
they will.

2492
02:32:47.640 --> 02:32:51.210
And you sound like you're smart enough so you shouldn't be in this situation.

2493
02:32:52.950 --> 02:32:56.520
Um,
any continues and the whole,
whoever does the accent accent,

2494
02:32:56.521 --> 02:33:01.500
whoever does the ax asking pays for the meal bit is really getting tired because

2495
02:33:01.501 --> 02:33:06.060
the fact is women are pussies and they won't ask men out.
Yeah.

2496
02:33:06.190 --> 02:33:08.730
And there's also the other thing that a lot of guys get a little nervous if

2497
02:33:08.731 --> 02:33:11.220
women are being really forward and then like Jesus Christ,

2498
02:33:11.280 --> 02:33:15.990
if she's fucking asking me out,
how many Cox is,
this bitch sucked.
Oh,

2499
02:33:17.310 --> 02:33:20.010
um,
but why are so many women in this post feminist world?

2500
02:33:20.580 --> 02:33:23.520
Why are so many in women in this post feminist world,

2501
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:28.550
sorry guys who have equal equal earning power as men and who even have an over

2502
02:33:29.610 --> 02:33:33.480
advantage in the marketplace these days.
Parentheses,

2503
02:33:33.481 --> 02:33:35.130
if they have a pretty face,

2504
02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:41.730
seem to insist on demeaning themselves to you.
You got a lot of issues here,
man.

2505
02:33:43.740 --> 02:33:46.980
Uh,
they have an overt advantage in the market.
They're still making less,

2506
02:33:46.981 --> 02:33:50.430
aren't they?
At least that's what they're always fucking run in the yaps about.

2507
02:33:51.690 --> 02:33:54.480
If they're good looking that it,
you know,

2508
02:33:54.481 --> 02:33:56.910
something that is a hell of a card to play.
If you're a hot chick,

2509
02:33:56.911 --> 02:34:00.090
how do you not get fucking hired?
You know what I mean?

2510
02:34:00.390 --> 02:34:03.420
Even if you are a fucking Bimbo,
you can go,
oh my God,

2511
02:34:03.870 --> 02:34:07.770
I love the carpet.
Can I have some money to be here?

2512
02:34:08.710 --> 02:34:12.780
He swear to God,
I'm always gonna dress hot and pretend I like you.
Um,

2513
02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:16.290
why do women so often refuse to step up to the plate and myth that they want to

2514
02:34:16.291 --> 02:34:20.510
fuck and put in their equal share?
Uh,

2515
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:22.780
now that they have equal rights,

2516
02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:26.920
maybe there would be more satisfied couples in the world if women would learn to

2517
02:34:26.921 --> 02:34:29.830
do this.
Uh,
dude,

2518
02:34:29.831 --> 02:34:31.930
you sound like me like 10 years ago,

2519
02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:36.130
it sure seems to me that women are getting away with murder these days.

2520
02:34:36.131 --> 02:34:37.190
They cling to old school.

2521
02:34:37.260 --> 02:34:40.900
The ideas about paying for them to live while making a better living than the

2522
02:34:40.901 --> 02:34:45.730
guy they're leeching off of and expected to be pleasured wildly in bed.

2523
02:34:46.450 --> 02:34:51.010
How does that add up?
You can see it in newer porn now.

2524
02:34:52.030 --> 02:34:55.420
Wow,
dude,
you really,
you really,

2525
02:34:55.690 --> 02:34:57.990
you're really connected some fucking dots here that,

2526
02:34:58.450 --> 02:35:00.070
where do you see this in porn?

2527
02:35:00.071 --> 02:35:03.760
He said more and more time is being spent actually pleasuring the woman,

2528
02:35:05.260 --> 02:35:08.710
Eh,
Jesus really?
And all those fucking boot cocky facial

2529
02:35:10.330 --> 02:35:15.210
today.
I really,
out of all the examples you're going to say that,

2530
02:35:15.211 --> 02:35:19.900
that women are getting pleasured more in porn.
Uh,
if they are,

2531
02:35:19.901 --> 02:35:24.430
it's probably about fucking time.
You know,
how are they getting pleasured more?

2532
02:35:24.790 --> 02:35:24.791
They're,

2533
02:35:24.791 --> 02:35:29.791
they're not getting fucking bent over on a subway platform and getting Bang Gang

2534
02:35:29.920 --> 02:35:34.420
Bang.
My fucking 12 guys.
It's just one homeless dude doing it.
You know,

2535
02:35:34.421 --> 02:35:38.080
come on dude.
Porn porn is horrific.

2536
02:35:39.730 --> 02:35:44.440
You know,
occasionally,
where do women when in porn,
I think those,

2537
02:35:44.500 --> 02:35:48.940
those,
uh,
those,
those strip ones where they just do the strip tease,
that one,

2538
02:35:48.941 --> 02:35:51.250
I think they win because there's no guy in it.

2539
02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:56.200
They just sort of turn the camera on this sort of in control of the whole thing.

2540
02:35:56.350 --> 02:35:59.410
Yet you also got to ask yourself,
why are they doing that?

2541
02:36:00.250 --> 02:36:04.300
What the fuck happened to them as a kid that,
uh,
you know,

2542
02:36:04.301 --> 02:36:07.450
eventually made them think that this is the way to make a living in the world.

2543
02:36:08.170 --> 02:36:10.630
You know,
like that,
like this is going to lead to happiness.

2544
02:36:10.631 --> 02:36:15.400
Like you can actually do this film yourself and actually go out and find a

2545
02:36:15.401 --> 02:36:18.730
decent husband or a person to,
to fucking settle down with some day.

2546
02:36:18.731 --> 02:36:22.060
Like they're going to be able to look past the fact that you were finger blast

2547
02:36:22.170 --> 02:36:24.520
and yourself on the Goddamn Internet.

2548
02:36:24.521 --> 02:36:27.000
That really sort of limits the amount of guys that you,
I don't know.

2549
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:32.070
I really come from the school that most of those people were fucking abused as

2550
02:36:32.621 --> 02:36:36.730
kids.
I really do.
I really do.
It doesn't stop me from watching it.

2551
02:36:38.020 --> 02:36:41.350
Um,
so anyways,
this is what I would say to you.

2552
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:45.010
I know you're probably fucking mad at me because you wanted me to fucking vent

2553
02:36:45.011 --> 02:36:49.900
your frustrations,
but uh,
I'm trying to help you out here,
dude.

2554
02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:53.080
Why would you,
there's no fucking,
you know,

2555
02:36:53.081 --> 02:36:58.000
something that Goddamn Jersey shore,
right?
The fucking,

2556
02:36:58.120 --> 02:37:02.110
the Nice Guy,
the Nice Guy,
Vinny.
Oh,
that dude.
Right,

2557
02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:06.140
right.
So like a more on here.
He went out and uh,

2558
02:37:06.190 --> 02:37:08.460
he met some girl down there and the whole time I guess she was,

2559
02:37:08.461 --> 02:37:12.940
she's been playing the guy like she was supposed to meet him at eight calls up

2560
02:37:12.941 --> 02:37:16.700
at eight 15.
She says she's just getting ready.
And then when he's,

2561
02:37:16.701 --> 02:37:20.390
when he's out to dinner with her,
she said something to the effect of like,

2562
02:37:20.391 --> 02:37:24.770
so will you get an upset waiting for me?
Did you think I wasn't going to show up?

2563
02:37:25.220 --> 02:37:29.870
And it's like right there,
right there,
right there.
You check please.

2564
02:37:30.800 --> 02:37:35.370
It's over.
You just fucking walk away.
Why would you wait?

2565
02:37:35.450 --> 02:37:37.630
You like people who manipulate our,

2566
02:37:37.890 --> 02:37:42.890
our are honestly some of the biggest pieces of shit on the fucking planet.

2567
02:37:43.070 --> 02:37:45.080
There's no way you want to hit your wagon to that.

2568
02:37:45.081 --> 02:37:48.260
Even for one fucking night and all it's gonna do

2569
02:37:50.180 --> 02:37:55.100
a male or females.
It's just going to make you hate the opposite sex more.

2570
02:37:55.910 --> 02:37:59.470
You're,
you're dating costs.
You're going on a date with [inaudible],

2571
02:37:59.510 --> 02:38:02.420
male or female.
You did this,
this,
why would you,

2572
02:38:02.421 --> 02:38:05.780
if you don't want to pay for somebody else's time,

2573
02:38:06.850 --> 02:38:09.500
all right.
That's because your time is valuable.

2574
02:38:09.501 --> 02:38:14.501
Why would you waste your time going out on a date with someone that you knew was

2575
02:38:14.661 --> 02:38:18.560
manipulative or word?
I can't say manipulative.

2576
02:38:18.620 --> 02:38:23.090
Manipulative,
manipulative.
That kind of sound right?

2577
02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:27.710
That's like learning a new drum.
Ruderman right.
You know,
just go full speed.

2578
02:38:28.840 --> 02:38:32.870
You've got to go right.
Left,
right,
right.
Left,
right,
left,
right.

2579
02:38:32.900 --> 02:38:36.670
Fuck right.
Left.
Right,
right.
Left,
right,
left,
left us.
Only makes sense.

2580
02:38:36.770 --> 02:38:39.040
The drummers.
Um,
so that,
that's my advice dude,

2581
02:38:39.300 --> 02:38:43.010
because I could really just sit here and do what the 9 million fucking rant on

2582
02:38:43.011 --> 02:38:43.820
women,

2583
02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:47.180
or I could actually maybe try to fucking help you avoid some of the pitfalls

2584
02:38:47.181 --> 02:38:51.350
that I,
that I went through.
There's no fucking reason.
The second male or female,

2585
02:38:51.351 --> 02:38:54.740
the second you figure out that you're with someone who's a cunt or you get that

2586
02:38:54.741 --> 02:38:58.820
feeling that the person I'm with is a cont.
Uh,
pay attention to that feeling.

2587
02:38:59.310 --> 02:39:02.060
All right.
When someone shows you who they are,

2588
02:39:02.240 --> 02:39:06.770
believe them go to a bed and if they're a client,
walk away.
All right,
real quick,

2589
02:39:06.920 --> 02:39:09.020
because this podcast is really long.
Uh,

2590
02:39:09.021 --> 02:39:12.950
I only have one youtube video of the week,
but this is almost like youtube video,

2591
02:39:13.340 --> 02:39:17.480
the weeks slash daily show moment of Zen.
Um,
go to the,
uh,

2592
02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:22.070
mm podcast.com and check this video out.
It says,
uh,
this is actually,

2593
02:39:22.071 --> 02:39:27.071
I found it on break.com and it's called a chick makes same dumb face in every

2594
02:39:28.810 --> 02:39:32.720
pick.
It's Kinda going back to that duck face.
It's,
it's actually,

2595
02:39:32.750 --> 02:39:34.100
it starts off funny.

2596
02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:39.300
Then it starts to get boring because it's so long and then it,

2597
02:39:39.301 --> 02:39:44.120
it becomes like,
I dunno,
it's like astounding.

2598
02:39:44.450 --> 02:39:48.260
The amount of pictures that this woman took with the exact same stupid fucking

2599
02:39:48.261 --> 02:39:50.300
look on her face.
All right.
Underrated.

2600
02:39:50.301 --> 02:39:52.850
Overrated for this week and then I'm out now.
Overrated.

2601
02:39:53.390 --> 02:39:55.160
Long a love for your fellow man.

2602
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:59.270
I'm tired of being made to feel guilty because I don't care about people whose

2603
02:39:59.271 --> 02:40:04.100
lives are not any part of mine mostly because no one does.
No.

2604
02:40:04.310 --> 02:40:08.720
See because no one does and you're a hypocrite if you say you do.

2605
02:40:08.990 --> 02:40:12.170
We aren't designed to care about everyone.
If we,

2606
02:40:12.230 --> 02:40:14.760
if we were than we would have survived.

2607
02:40:16.290 --> 02:40:20.130
If you think about it,
I don't know what that means.
Resources or,
oh,

2608
02:40:20.131 --> 02:40:24.420
he's explaining it.
Resources are limited.
There's no shame in self interest.

2609
02:40:24.660 --> 02:40:28.860
Take care of your own.
It's a noble and honest outlook.

2610
02:40:29.910 --> 02:40:30.743
All right.

2611
02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:35.160
Underrated contests where you win something that isn't actually a prize.

2612
02:40:36.570 --> 02:40:39.540
I opened my flavored water and it said I want something.

2613
02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:43.560
I entered the code on the site to see what I won and hear what it is.

2614
02:40:43.561 --> 02:40:47.610
And I quote by one and I'm not gonna say the name of the water because they

2615
02:40:47.611 --> 02:40:51.630
pissed me off by one of these fucking waters and get one free.

2616
02:40:51.900 --> 02:40:56.310
Is that a prize?
No,
I think that's a fucking coupon.
You're 100% right.

2617
02:40:56.370 --> 02:41:00.240
CanNot agree with you more sir.
Or ma'am,
whoever wrote this,
um,

2618
02:41:01.350 --> 02:41:04.170
overrated Cialis disclaimer on the commercial.

2619
02:41:04.171 --> 02:41:07.230
Do not drink alcohol in excess with Cialis.

2620
02:41:07.410 --> 02:41:12.410
The fact that they said it means someone out there needs both boner pills and

2621
02:41:13.291 --> 02:41:16.910
excessive amounts of alcohol in order to manifest the ability,

2622
02:41:16.980 --> 02:41:19.380
ability to fuck whoever they're with.

2623
02:41:19.710 --> 02:41:24.240
Might be time to try a paper bag maybe.
Um,
all right.

2624
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:29.580
Underrated to blade razors.
Surf.
I already mentioned this on the podcast,

2625
02:41:29.581 --> 02:41:31.440
so God bless you for backing me up.

2626
02:41:31.530 --> 02:41:34.230
Is it so hard to perfect the design of a shaving razor?

2627
02:41:34.470 --> 02:41:38.970
Is it every year they come up with a new design and how shocking they added

2628
02:41:38.971 --> 02:41:42.330
another blade.
Stop this bullshit marketing nonsense.

2629
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:46.410
I hope no one falls for this shit to blades is all you need to.

2630
02:41:46.411 --> 02:41:50.970
Blades was the greatest one ever.
One digged up.
Your phase two was the greatest,

2631
02:41:50.971 --> 02:41:52.500
and ever since they're three or more,

2632
02:41:52.501 --> 02:41:54.660
you can't get those whiskers under your fucking nose.

2633
02:41:54.661 --> 02:41:57.720
It's a pain in the goddamn ass and it's not any closer.

2634
02:41:58.800 --> 02:42:02.820
I don't give a shit how many blades they have.
You know,

2635
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:05.250
it's really like an unfair fight.

2636
02:42:05.251 --> 02:42:09.510
Like how many guys do you have to have holding the fucking whiskers arms behind

2637
02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:12.390
his back and you come up and fucking start working him over.

2638
02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:15.500
Two blades is enough.
One holds the whisker,

2639
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:19.590
the other guy takes out his fucking knees.
All right.
Overrated.
Twitter.

2640
02:42:19.800 --> 02:42:23.130
A number of people are apparently disappointed to find out that celebrities have

2641
02:42:23.131 --> 02:42:28.050
normal lives in that they waste time and talk about stupid shit like everyone

2642
02:42:28.051 --> 02:42:28.530
else.

2643
02:42:28.530 --> 02:42:33.530
They must have thought they were riding around on the back of a Griffin hurling

2644
02:42:34.950 --> 02:42:39.240
lightning with a magic hammer all day,
underrated sleep,
sex.

2645
02:42:39.270 --> 02:42:41.070
This is where this person becomes creepy.

2646
02:42:41.280 --> 02:42:44.250
And obviously I feel this as a dude at this point.
Uh,

2647
02:42:44.251 --> 02:42:48.120
this is the ultimate passive aggressive move to when you can't get any.

2648
02:42:48.540 --> 02:42:52.860
Just wait until they're falling asleep.
Not only will they not stop you,

2649
02:42:53.100 --> 02:42:57.810
but they will,
but they tend to be much less critical of your performance.

2650
02:42:59.070 --> 02:43:04.070
Remember earlier when I was talking about sociopath running the fucking world,

2651
02:43:04.201 --> 02:43:06.880
this guy said overrated.
Um,

2652
02:43:06.930 --> 02:43:10.410
love for your fellow man or whatever the fuck the initial one was

2653
02:43:11.980 --> 02:43:14.500
me.
Where the hell is it?
Over?
Yeah.
Love for your fellow man.

2654
02:43:14.890 --> 02:43:19.090
And now he's talking about how sleep sex,
which really seems like a form of rape,

2655
02:43:19.660 --> 02:43:23.540
sort of rape life,
sort of a light,
uh,

2656
02:43:25.330 --> 02:43:29.840
sexual assault.
Okay.
That,
that one's just creepy sir.

2657
02:43:30.450 --> 02:43:33.470
And uh,
and with that,
I think I'm done reading underrated,

2658
02:43:33.480 --> 02:43:34.420
overrated at this point.

2659
02:43:35.580 --> 02:43:40.250
I don't want to see what the next two one go the next to next to ones go the

2660
02:43:40.251 --> 02:43:44.540
next to go out.
Who gives a fuck?
Anyways,
that's the podcast for this week.

2661
02:43:44.541 --> 02:43:48.050
God bless all of you.
Please come down.
I'm doing a benefit in Saint Louis.

2662
02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:52.940
Support the cause.
I have all the information up on my website and uh,

2663
02:43:53.650 --> 02:43:57.250
if not,
if you just want to see me,
uh,
cause that show,
I think I'm just doing 15,

2664
02:43:57.251 --> 02:43:59.650
20 minutes.
But if you want to see the full on me,

2665
02:44:00.780 --> 02:44:04.470
come to the Saint Louis funny bone this Saturday night,

2666
02:44:04.930 --> 02:44:09.760
which is Saturday,
October 30th,
the night before Halloween.

2667
02:44:11.050 --> 02:44:14.330
Ah,
come on down.
I'm doing two shows at the funny bone.
Seven 30 and 10 o'clock.

2668
02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:18.770
I've got my brand new hour of material.
I'll have my brand new DVD.

2669
02:44:19.460 --> 02:44:22.730
I'll have a brand new fucking shirt on.
Everything's going to be brand new.

2670
02:44:22.731 --> 02:44:25.400
Come on down.
All right,
that's it.
God bless all of you.
Have a great [inaudible].

2671
02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:52.713
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

2672
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:57.520
<v 7>in your case,
shoot me</v>

2673
02:45:05.090 --> 02:45:09.340
his dad.
I don't take it down.

2674
02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:16.840
She's in Latin.
You can shoot me.

2675
02:45:21.550 --> 02:45:24.660
She Cs and you dare to try.

2676
02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:35.570
I sit him not,
don't shoot your little woman.

2677
02:45:39.680 --> 02:45:42.820
My daughter's best shot gun.
It just won't fly.
