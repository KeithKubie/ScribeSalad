00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.260
*Fancy music*

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.800
"Hooooooly smokes!"

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.900
Christopher Columbus!

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.680
That is no way to address the King and Queen of Spain! What is wrong with you?"

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.280
"Ok. Ok!"

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.780
"So you know how we're looking for a new trade route to India, right?"
"Right"

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.080
"And the earth is round, right?"
"Right."

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.180
"So I'm thinking we can just sail the oooother way around the planet, right?"
"Yeah?"

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.960
"So I set sail, right?"

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:15.540
"Mhm?"

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:16.380
"And I reach India, right?"

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.420
"Righ-"
"Wrong!"

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.160
"W R O N G!"

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.920
"I did NOT reach India."

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.060
"I did NOT!"

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:21.940
"Alright-"
"NO"

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.140
"Alright, get to the point."

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.380
"DID YOU KNOW"

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.440
"There's a whole another freaking continent out there!"

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.700
"Okay. And do you think I should care about this, why??

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.880
"Oh, I'm sorry. Did I forget to mention? There's GOLD EVERYWHERE!"

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.460
"Gold?"

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.200
AAHHHHH!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.780
Columbus landed in Central America in October 1492

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.220
and he had the time of his life.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.320
And by that, I mean, he went on a huge theft and murder spree.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.720
He stole gold, jewelry, people, and a hammock.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.560
And then he returned to show off all of his riches,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.580
Including a few previously undiscovered items, such as tobacco, the pineapple, turkeys, and a hammock.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.480
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.120
"But OverSimplified, Columbus didn't discover America, the Vikings did!"

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.080
And you'd be partially right.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.280
In the 11th century, Leif Erikson was the first European to land in America.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.240
But hey, if you love Vikings so much, then why don't you...

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.840
check out today's sponsor?

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.480
Viking's War of Clans is a mobile game that was inspired

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.900
by the famous strategy and RPG games of the 90's

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.060
like Age of Empires and Civilization

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.480
Do you like building cities? Collecting resources? Training armies? Joining a clan and going to war?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.300
Then my friends, Viking's War of Clans is for you.

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.620
And what makes its world so addictive is that

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.140
more than twenty million online players are constantly changing the way the game evolves

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.460
by never-ending fighting over resources, forging new alliances, and competing in live events.

Don't forget to look me up and join my Vikings clan under my nickname, "OverSimplified"

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.700
Now, where was I?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.660
Oh, yeah.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.289
Columbus, time of his life,

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.780
hammock.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.020
And suddenly the race was on to explore and conquer the New World.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.980
After a couple centuries of warring with the natives and each other,

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.880
the European powers had claimed quite a lot of land,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.960
including this area which both the English and the French claimed is theirs.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.200
One day, the French said,
"I'm gonna build some forts along here."

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.440
And the English were like, "Could you not?"

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.479
And the French said, "Sorry."

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:04.820
"But no, I could not not."

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.040
And they went ahead and built their forts,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.140
which pissed off the English.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.380
So they sent an upcoming British lieutenant-colonel by the name of George Washington,

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.920
with a combined force of British troops and Native Americans.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.480
After a short battle, the French commander said,

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:15.774
"Alright, alright, we surrender."

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.639
"Ok, boys. Pack it up. They're surrenderi-"

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.720
*slice*

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.780
"Oh, sorry. Was I NOT meant to split his head open with a Tomahawk?"

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.080
"Ah, don't worry. It's not like this will start a seven-year long major global conflict."

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.660
And what happened next was a 7-year long major global conflict

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.700
which Great Britain won!
(football's coming home plays)

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.020
At the peace negotiations, Spain gave up Florida,

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.240
while France gave up all of its territories in North America.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.200
But Britain's victory came at a cost.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.700
A Â£60 MILLION cost.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.200
They were now broke, in a lot of debt, and had to come up with some way to repay it.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.480
So they went to the Colonies and said,
"Okay listen up."

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.840
"So a huge part of the war was spent protecting you from the French.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.580
"And now we have no money because of it."

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.760
So...

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.020
"I'm not sure what you're saying here."

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.520
"Okay. So, we spent a lot of money protecting you from the French, right?"

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.400
"Right."
"And now we're broke."

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.700
*subtle silence*

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.080
"That certainly is a pickle."
"LISTEN TO ME."

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.200
"We spent all of our money protecting YOU, and now we need money."

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.260
"Can you please pay us back some money?"

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.480
"No."

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.320
"Okay, we're just going to go ahead and tax you."

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.520
In 1764, Britain introduced the Sugar Act,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.140
forcing the colonists to import sugar and molasses exclusively from the British, and to pay duties on them.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.140
Then, a year later, they introduced the extremely controversial Stamp Act, and it worked a little something like this:

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.996
"Hello shopkeep."

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.880
"Hello, Mr. Bungleberry."

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.320
"Here's the deed for your new shack."

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.820
"STAMP."

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.536
"That'll be three pence, please."

00:03:26.536 --> 00:03:27.649
"Wait. What was that?"

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:32.089
"It's the new tax. I get a stamp on any paper or documentation I make, and you have to pay for it."

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.320
"Would you like to see this pamphlet that explains everything?"

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.880
"Yes, please."

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.214
"Okay. Stamp. 2 pence, please."

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.980
"This is awful!"

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.040
"You know what? Just give me a deck of cards so I can go gamble my pain away."

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.680
"OK."

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:43.460
"No.."

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.760
"Don't do it."

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.260
"Stamp."

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.480
Obviously the colonists were like "Hey my dudes, this new tax legislation right here,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.820
This is *BS*"

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.880
Until now they had enjoyed relative freedom to rule themselves,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.660
And now suddenly Britain was asserting its control.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.480
They were especially unhappy because they didn't have any representatives in the Parliament that was levying taxes on them.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.580
So they protested.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.880
Orators gave fiery speeches.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.240
British goods were boycotted and anyone loyal to the British found themselves increasingly harassed.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.300
The whole thing actually began to take quite a toll on British business and after just a couple years the British were forced to repeal the Stamp Act.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.840
"But we still desperately need money. What should we do?"

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.160
"We could try taxing the colonies."

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.040
"GREAT IDEA!!!"

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:23.820
"Wait, didn't we literally just try that, and it failed miserably?"

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.080
"Man, look at me. I look fabulous.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.700
*georgy, dont get frisky*

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.160
Have you ever seen such a handsome boy? No siree, Georgie. No way

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.880
You're the handsomest, smartest, most popular King that ever lived and everybody likes you.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.440
You're doing such a good job."

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.480
"Uh, Your Majesty ?"

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.700
"Oh, you're still here."

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.260
"Get the hell out."

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.620
So in 1766 the British made a declaration saying "We can do what we want, because we're in charge and you can all go suck it"

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.920
Then they levied a whole bunch of new taxes on the Americans via import duties.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.260
Glass? There's a tax for that. Lead? There's a tax for that.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.220
Paper? Tea? Oil?

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.600
There's a tax for that.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.800
And once again The Americans boycotted British goods,

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.560
British business felt the pinch, and the British had to back down.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.420
"Alright, this is ridiculous. They're my colonies and I have to be able to assert my control.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.349
Repeal all the new taxes except for the one on tea. Also send 1,000 troops to Boston to take control."

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:12.460
"Oh and make the colonists pay for them."

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.420
And as British troops arrived, the tension in Boston is palpable, you could cut it with a knife.

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.060
And it was all about to come to a head.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.020
On March 5th, a band of local Patriots began heckling a British guard at the Customs House.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.900
More and more Americans joined in the heckling,

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.360
While more British troops turned up in support of their comrade.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.120
Snowballs were thrown at the British.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.220
The snowballs turned to rocks.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.520
The rocks to oyster shells.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.720
The soldiers, outnumbered.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.680
Panicked, one thing leads to another and you can see where this is going.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:35.580
*Gunshots*

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.800
five civilians were killed. The Patriot pressed throughout the colonies declared the Boston Massacre an

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.380
unwarranted crime committed against the people of Boston, by the cruel British.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.960
And the anger continued to grow.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.440
A British revenue schooner that ran aground in Rhode Island is burned by the locals.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.300
When it came to light, that the governor of Massachusetts supported the suppression of the colonists,

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.620
his house was burned by the locals.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.520
And next, the colonists would set their sight on the remaining tax on tea.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.740
On December 16th, 1773 a band of patriots known as the Sons of Liberty

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.060
Disguised themselves as Native Americans, marched down to Boston Harbor.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.160
Boarded a British merchant ship loaded with tea.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.560
And in front of thousand spectators, threw nearly 10,000 pounds worth of tea overboard.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.160
The British were disgusted, and they punished Massachusetts with a vengeance.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.860
They dissolved its General Assembly, revoked their charter, and sent 3,000 more troops to occupy the city.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.520
Meaning Boston and Massachusetts were now essentially under the direct rule of Great Britain.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:28.620
And oh boy were the people pissed.

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:31.580
The other colonies saw what was happening, and worried they might be next.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.000
So they called a brain trust to decide what to do.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.620
Fifty-six delegates from 12 colonies gathered and met in Philadelphia at the First Continental Congress.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.580
And the roll call read like a who's who of America's finest thinkers

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.580
I'm talking lawyers extraordinaire:
Johnny A and Johnny Jay,

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.840
Experienced military commander;
George Washington

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.540
Businessman and future alcoholic beverage;
Samuel Adams.

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.240
Fiery Orator;
Patty H

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.640
Guy who married a rich lady;
(BIG) J Dickinson.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:55.460
And while they weren't present at the first Congress,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:59.060
Soon name like James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and much later...

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.040
Alexander Hamilton would all serve time in the Continental Congress.

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.380
The question now though, was what to do about the British.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.300
After much bitter debate and disagreement,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.460
they eventually agreed on an amazing solution.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.860
They would simply ask the British to stop.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.820
"Can you stop?"

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.740
"No."

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:13.360
"It didn't work."

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:17.440
"OK, then tell the local militias to start arming and be ready at a minutes notice."

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.880
And across the colonies, these Minutemen stood ready for the beginning of the American Revolutionary War.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.540
Now having your colonies in open rebellion is one thing.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.540
Once they start arming themselves, that's when it really hits the fan.

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:33.100
So British General Thomas Gage ordered 700 troops from Boston out into the rebel controlled

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.980
Massachusetts countryside, to destroy stores of arms and ammunition held by the rebels in Concord.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.840
The British set up in the middle of the night.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:44.120
Patriots including Paul Revere rode ahead to warn that the British were coming, giving the rebels time to prepare.

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.980
The two sides met in Lexington as the Sun began to rise.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.420
They faced off against each other, and in the confusion somebody shot first.

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.920
*Gunshots*

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.600
The shot heard around the world marked the beginning of the American War of Independence.

00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:58.360
The rebels were outnumbered and had to fall back to Concord,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:00.340
as the British slit up to search for rebel supplies.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.800
However, more and more Patriot rebels kept showing up,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:06.720
and this time it was the British who outnumbered, as more fighting kicked off in Concord.

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:12.240
The most professional army in the world was forced to flee back to Boston at the hands of local, poorly trained militiamen.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.740
And all along the British route back to Boston, patriot rebels continued to gather an open fire on the retreating British.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:20.660
When the British reached Boston, the rebel militias surrounded them.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:25.580
Boston and the British were now under siege, as small landed naval skirmishes continued around the city.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:28.260
And the British would suffer another embarrassing blow.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:29.740
This time in upstate New York,

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:33.860
Colonel Benedict Arnold concocted a plan to take the British stronghold, Fort Ticonderoga.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.620
Which held a large amount of guns and ammunition, he set off towards the fort alone.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.960
Hoping to recruit men along the way, when he came across the Green Mountain Boys,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.080
lead by Ethan Allen.

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.340
Who as it turned out, had the exact same plan he did.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.680
So they decided to work together...

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.220
But I'm in charge. No, I'm in charge. No, I'm in charge

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.420
No, I'm in charge. No, I'm in charge. No, I'm in charge. No, I'm in charge

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:56.400
This went on for some time, until the Green Mountain Boys threatened to go home and, Arnold had to concede.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.160
The group raided the fort at night, while the Redcoats were asleep.

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:04.000
And they caught them completely by surprise, taking the fort and all of its munitions with almost no resistance.

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:09.100
"Wow, great job Ethan, very impressive. By the way. What happened to that other guy we sent to take the fort?"

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.780
"Who?"

00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.680
"Benedict Arnold."

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.920
"Never heard of him."

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:13.820
"ouch."

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.180
...

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:16.980
"What.

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.840
"What. The.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.340
"What. The. Fu-"

00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.940
Nobody knew what was going on.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.140
The colonies were an open rebellion, and for now they even seem to be winning

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.780
So King George fired general Gage,

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:26.480
replaced him with General William Howe,

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.800
and ordered their rebellion to be put down immediately.

00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:31.220
"Okay, the British are definitely going to retaliate for all of this.

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.020
So we should probably put together a proper army.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.620
First we need to pick a Commander-in-Chief,

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.200
and I think we can all agree that that job should go to the man,

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:37.820
the myth,

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:38.560
the legend...

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.360
George Washington."

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.460
"My friends, I am humbled and honored that you would consider me for such an important role.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:44.680
I did not expect for this-"

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:47.749
"All right, you've been showing up in a military uniform every day for the last 10 months.

00:09:47.749 --> 00:09:49.740
We all know you wanted this, so cut the crap George"

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.080
"Dude...

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:52.880
Uncool."

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.560
So Washington began his journey up to Boston to take command of the newly established Continental Army,

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.260
just as British made their first major attempts to break the siege.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.540
They made plans to take the high ground on Bunker Hill,

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.720
but spies warned the continentals of the British plans.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:08.060
So they fortified Bunker Hill, and set up defensive positions on nearby breeds Hill.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.120
The day of the battle came.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.720
And as the British advanced, a barrage of continental gunfire was opened up on them.

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:15.500
Twice they tried to climb the hill, twice they were pushed back.

00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.860
The battle lasted three hours until the Continentals finally ran out of ammunition and had to retreat.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.580
Allowing the British to take the hill.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:26.440
While technically a British victory, they suffered nearly 1,000 casualties to the Continental's 400.

00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:29.000
The colonists show the British that this wasn't just a rebellion.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.240
It was war, and they were ready for it.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.060
BUT,

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.700
One thing they weren't sure about, was why they were fighting.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.120
Well some radicals were starting to throw around the 'i' word,

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.020
most hope to eventually repair their relationship with Great Britain.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.780
So they sent a letter to King George saying:
"Hey man, looks like things aren't going your way.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.620
Remove the taxes and let's be friends?"

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.320
"I'm

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:48.380
"I'm gonna

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:49.420
"I'm gonna kick

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:50.320
"I'm gonna kick your

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.020
"I'm gonna kick your ass!"

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.360
"Send that to the colonies."

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.660
"Your majesty, your handwriting is terrible. Are you sure?"

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.960
"JUST DO IT!"

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.400
"What does it say?"

00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:59.140
"He's gonna...

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:00.800
lick my..."

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.300
"Gross."

00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:07.320
So for the remainder of the year small engagements continued to occur around the colony.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.500
The British burned down the towns of Falmouth, Massachusetts and Norfolk, Virginia

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.600
As revenge for earlier anti-British incidents.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.180
These actions played right into the hands of Patriot propaganda

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.100
Overseas, the British were seen as brutes, and the French and Spanish would soon begin sending supplies to the rebel cause

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.040
During this time

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.300
There was also minor fighting going on between patriot and loyalist militias in the southern colony.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.400
Benedict Arnold was still on a mission to win some personal glory for himself

00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.340
So he headed up an attempt to invade Canada in a two-pronged attack.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:34.540
The Continentals managed to capture some British forts and the city of Montreal.

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.140
But a harsh snowstorm with some smallpox on the side saw them defeated

00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.840
and pushed back at Quebec City.

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.420
And they were forced to retreat all the way to Fort Ticonderoga.

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.160
Speaking of which, remember all those guns and ammunition?

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:46.060
Well, this guy's got a plan for what to do with them.

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:49.140
He uses oxen to drag a hundred and 120,000 pounds of artillery,

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:50.360
for two months through the harsh winter.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:54.140
300 miles all the way to Washington and his Continental Army surrounding Boston.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:54.860
BOOM!

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:56.440
Washington's got himself some big guns.

00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:00.060
Which is fortunate, because up until now his army had been suffering through the cold winter,

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.480
not knowing when the siege would end.

00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.820
Now they could make him move.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.120
Washington wanted to launch a full assault on the city.

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:08.400
But his junior officers felt the British were too fortified, and to his credit

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:12.240
Washington was great at hearing and taking on board the ideas of others.

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.640
Instead, the continentals worked through the night setting the guns up on Dorchester Heights

00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:16.620
overlooking the city.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.680
And when Dawn Broke, and the British saw the guns,

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:21.540
they knew they were toast, their positions were completely exposed.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:22.380
It was checkmate.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:24.340
They had no choice but to abandon the city

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:28.940
120 ships carried 9,000 redcoats, and 2,000 loyalist, away to an unknown fate.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:31.320
Washington had his first victory, of the war.

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.200
Washington then moved his army to New York.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:36.060
Knowing that when the British returned, they would probably land there.

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.700
in the meantime a friendly looking old man by the name of Thomas Paine

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.040
Had written and published a pamphlet called 'Common Sense'

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.700
In which he advocated for total independence from Great Britain.

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.540
It spread across the colonies like wildfire.

00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.020
Until this day remains the best-selling title in America

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:52.380
It was read aloud in taverns and meeting halls, and brought the idea of Independence into the mainstream

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.680
Congress began to seriously consider the idea.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.060
Thomas Jefferson was selected to write up an official declaration of independence.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:04.160
And he went hard, writing that:
'All men are created equal, with certain inalienable rights."

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.880
Of course Jefferson had over a hundred slaves

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.040
but we don't have to talk about that.

00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.400
The 2nd of July, congress voted unanimously in favor of independence.

00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:12.940
And Johns Adams declared that the 2nd of July would go down as

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:15.000
the most remembered day in American history.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.500
Then a couple days later, independence actually came into effect.

00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:19.740
The United States of America was born.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.060
There was no turning back now.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:23.500
The Americans tore down a statue of King George in New York.

00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.860
And melted him down into 42,000 musket balls.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.440
To the British, it was treason.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.000
and if the King had his way Washington and all of Congress would be hung.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.280
Speaking of the British...

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:33.120
Guess who's back?

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:38.020
The king sent an intimidating force of 130 warships and 25,000 men to New York.

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:41.700
Washington knew that taking on the most powerful military in the world wouldn't be easy.

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.500
The British set up camp on Staten Island.

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:46.460
As the Americans dug into defensive positions around Brooklyn Heights.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.720
Waiting for an attack to come.

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.820
But the British just...

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.320
waited...

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.280
Wearing down their opponents nerve, while building their own strength.

00:13:52.340 --> 00:13:55.240
At one point, they launched a big scary artillery barrage and then said:

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.860
"You know if I was you right now, I'd probably sue for peace."

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:59.460
But Washington told him to shove it.

00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:01.360
The Americans kept holding out for what was coming,

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.460
and when they finally hit they hit hard.

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:08.320
15,000 British troops approached the American position, and the two sides fired on each other in massive rows.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:11.559
But what the Americans didn't realize, was they were only fighting a decoy

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.580
The main British force was going around to flank the Americans from behind.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:16.900
And when they arrived they inflicted heavy casualties.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.580
the Americans panicked and retreated back to Brooklyn Heights.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.360
Where they then found themselves trapped between the British Army and the river.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.260
It looked as though the war was already lost.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.700
But luckily, instead of attacking, the British decided to dig in for a siege.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.640
And then a thick fog set in, allowing Washington's army to escape across the river unimpeded.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.520
The British continued to chase and engage the Americans at Manhattan.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.280
And the Americans suffered defeat, after defeat, after defeat.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:41.380
It was a disaster, Washington's leadership was called into question.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.980
As thousands of American POWs were left to rot as traitors.

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.140
Washington's army fled through New Jersey.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.680
All the way down to, Pennsylvania

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:53.240
Rarely had an army been so badly beaten yet survived to fight another day.

00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:59.980
*music*
