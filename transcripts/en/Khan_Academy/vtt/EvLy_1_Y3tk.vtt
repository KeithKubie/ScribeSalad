00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:02.622
- [Voiceover] Two of
the most studied operons

00:00:02.622 --> 00:00:05.920
are the Trp operon and the Lac operon

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.290
and what I wanna do in
this video is focus on

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.351
the Trp operon, which is
essential for the production

00:00:12.351 --> 00:00:13.518
of tryptophan,

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:19.195
tryptophan, which you might
recognize as an amino acid

00:00:19.195 --> 00:00:22.774
often associated with
Thanksgiving and turkey dinner,

00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:25.914
but tryptophan, as all or most amino acids

00:00:25.914 --> 00:00:29.144
are essential for
creating the polypeptides,

00:00:29.144 --> 00:00:32.336
the proteins that you use in your body

00:00:32.336 --> 00:00:35.171
and so the Trp operon,
and here we're going to be

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:37.062
talking about not your
body, or we're going to be

00:00:37.062 --> 00:00:38.421
talking about something
that's in your body.

00:00:38.421 --> 00:00:40.678
We're gonna talk about E. Coli.

00:00:40.678 --> 00:00:45.063
It is an operon that is on
the E. Coli that is part of

00:00:45.063 --> 00:00:48.068
the E. Coli genome, and
just in this diagram,

00:00:48.068 --> 00:00:50.477
the way it's drawn, it would be sitting,

00:00:50.477 --> 00:00:52.868
it would be sitting right over here.

00:00:52.868 --> 00:00:56.753
And just as a reminder,
an operon is a combination

00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:00.920
of a set of genes, as well as
the regulatory DNA sequences

00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:06.185
for that set of genes, in
particular you have the promoter,

00:01:06.185 --> 00:01:08.645
you have the operator right over here.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.121
The promoter's where the
RNA polymerase binds and

00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:13.543
would start the transcription process.

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:15.596
The operator's where the repressor binds,

00:01:15.596 --> 00:01:17.169
and this is going to be essential for

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:20.528
understanding how the Trp operon works.

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:22.993
And so what are these
genes actually code for?

00:01:22.993 --> 00:01:26.428
Well these genes code
enzymes that are used

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:29.223
in the construction of tryptophan,

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:32.527
and I'm always amazed
that enzymes can be used

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:35.428
to construct what are
essentially molecules

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:37.819
that are much smaller than
the enzymes themselves.

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:40.111
In fact the enzymes involved are made up

00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:42.900
of amino acids, but then
they're used to make

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.983
particular amino acids,
and so Trp E, D, C, B, A,

00:01:48.326 --> 00:01:52.809
they're all, once they
are transcribed into mRNA

00:01:52.809 --> 00:01:55.149
and then translated into ribosomes,

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.125
these enzymes are used
to create tryptophan,

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:02.101
for tryptophan biosynthesis.

00:02:02.101 --> 00:02:04.704
So let's think about how this works.

00:02:04.704 --> 00:02:08.010
So, if we are in a low
tryptophan environment,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.390
our E. Coli, it needs tryptophan, it needs

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.114
that amino acid as a building
block for its proteins.

00:02:15.114 --> 00:02:17.202
So in that world, it
makes sense that in a low

00:02:17.202 --> 00:02:20.013
tryptophan environment, the RNA polymerase

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:23.258
can just latch on to
the promoter and begin

00:02:23.258 --> 00:02:28.077
the transcription process,
transcribe these five genes

00:02:28.077 --> 00:02:32.244
into mRNA which then can be
translated into those enzymes

00:02:34.456 --> 00:02:38.262
and they you will have more
tryptophan biosynthesis.

00:02:38.262 --> 00:02:41.285
That makes sense that you wanna
create tryptophan if you're

00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:45.448
in an environment that does
not have a lot of tryptophan.

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:47.869
But what if we did have
a lot of tryptophan?

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.613
Well if you have a lot
of something around,

00:02:49.613 --> 00:02:52.904
you shouldn't waste energy
creating more of it.

00:02:52.904 --> 00:02:56.439
You have to appreciate that
all organisms that are around

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:00.739
today are the byproducts of
billions of years of evolution

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.530
and they've learned to be
very careful, or the ones

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.664
that are selected for tend
to be the ones that don't

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:09.495
waste resources, and so when
you have tryptophan around,

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:12.288
you probably don't want
this transcription to occur.

00:03:12.288 --> 00:03:15.317
So it makes sense that maybe tryptophan

00:03:15.317 --> 00:03:19.985
can act as a co-repressor
for a repressor molecule,

00:03:19.985 --> 00:03:22.913
for a repressor enzyme, that would attach

00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:25.884
to the operator and
block the RNA polymerase

00:03:25.884 --> 00:03:29.254
from transcribing, and
that's exactly what happens.

00:03:29.254 --> 00:03:31.957
So if you're in a high
tryptophan environment,

00:03:31.957 --> 00:03:34.667
and tryptophan obviously does
not look like these little

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.627
yellow quadrilaterals over
there, but that's just

00:03:37.627 --> 00:03:39.438
for our visualization
purposes, and neither does RNA

00:03:39.438 --> 00:03:42.115
polymerase look like
that, or neither does the

00:03:42.115 --> 00:03:45.382
Trp repressor look like that, in fact

00:03:45.382 --> 00:03:46.867
I encourage you to web
search these and see

00:03:46.867 --> 00:03:49.028
how they actually look,
they're fascinating.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.516
But when you have a lot of
tryptophan, the tryptophan

00:03:51.516 --> 00:03:53.683
can act as a co-repressor,

00:03:56.824 --> 00:04:01.471
it can bind to the Trp repressor
essentially activate it

00:04:01.471 --> 00:04:04.836
so that it'll change its
confirmation so that it can then

00:04:04.836 --> 00:04:08.322
attach to the operator
in the operon, and once

00:04:08.322 --> 00:04:11.180
it's attached to the operator,
well then the RNA polymerase

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.258
can no longer move forward
with transcription.

00:04:14.258 --> 00:04:17.517
So as you can see this is a
very valuable feedback loop,

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:19.524
or not even necessarily
feedback, if you're in an

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:21.691
environment with a lot of
tryptophan, don't create

00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:23.964
tryptophan, or if you just
have a lot of tryptophan

00:04:23.964 --> 00:04:26.269
laying around, don't
create more tryptophan.

00:04:26.269 --> 00:04:29.794
If you don't have tryptophan
around, well then the

00:04:29.794 --> 00:04:32.501
repressor won't be co-repressed,
I guess you can say,

00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.706
and then the tryptophan
will actually be created.

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:37.974
Now, tryptophan's an
interesting thing because

00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:40.636
the control of transcription
isn't the only place

00:04:40.636 --> 00:04:43.474
where you have some
type of a feedback loop

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:45.768
or kind of a conditional situation.

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:49.070
You can actually have
direct feedback inhibition

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.932
between the proteins, and
so this part isn't related

00:04:51.932 --> 00:04:55.205
to the transcription, but
if this is a precursor

00:04:55.205 --> 00:04:58.282
of tryptophan, it's all very
abstract in this diagram,

00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:00.694
and let's say Enzyme 1
turns into Precursor 2,

00:05:00.694 --> 00:05:03.266
Enzyme 2 turns into
Precursor 3, and Enzyme 3

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:06.216
turns in into tryptophan,
well you actually have

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:09.991
direct feedback inhibition
where tryptophan can then bind

00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:14.001
or interact with Enzyme 1
here, could interact with

00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:18.237
Enzyme 1, let me do it
in a color you can see.

00:05:18.237 --> 00:05:21.651
Could interact with Enzyme
1 so that it can no longer

00:05:21.651 --> 00:05:25.998
act as efficiently taking
Precursor 1 to Precursor 2.

00:05:25.998 --> 00:05:29.021
So this right over here,
this is the classic

00:05:29.021 --> 00:05:31.360
feedback inhibition,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.027
feedback inhibition.

00:05:37.276 --> 00:05:39.633
The focus of this video,
we're talking about operons

00:05:39.633 --> 00:05:43.620
and gene regulation, but it's
important to realize that

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.952
the regulation of the
creation of tryptophan

00:05:46.952 --> 00:05:50.109
doesn't only occur at
the transcription level

00:05:50.109 --> 00:05:51.854
and I'm not gonna go into this video,

00:05:51.854 --> 00:05:55.733
it's a slightly more advanced
topic, but there's also

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:59.477
regulation of tryptophan
biases through a process

00:05:59.477 --> 00:06:02.680
called attenuation, which
doesn't affect the start

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.287
of transcription, but
it affects how things

00:06:06.287 --> 00:06:09.223
get completed, and it will
keep tryptophan from being

00:06:09.223 --> 00:06:13.390
completely, or the entire
process from going to completion.

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:17.921
But the ones that are most
typically talked about

00:06:17.921 --> 00:06:20.332
are what we just talked about
here, where you have your

00:06:20.332 --> 00:06:23.598
tryptophan act as a co-repressor
of the Trp repressor,

00:06:23.598 --> 00:06:26.120
and also the feedback
inhibition, which once again,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.773
it's not really about gene
regulation, but you can see

00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:31.107
how the product of this
process can go back

00:06:31.107 --> 00:06:34.190
and inhibit one of the first enzymes.
