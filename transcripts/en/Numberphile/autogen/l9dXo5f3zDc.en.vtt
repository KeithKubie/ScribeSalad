two sets of cars 1 2 3 4 is 1 4 3 2 1

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200
two sets of cars 1 2 3 4 is 1 4 3 2 1
 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.639
two sets of cars 1 2 3 4 is 1 4 3 2 1
again aces one space and hearts black

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
again aces one space and hearts black
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.190
again aces one space and hearts black
and red they're in opposite orders I now

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200
and red they're in opposite orders I now
 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.820
and red they're in opposite orders I now
turn them over and we're going to

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830
turn them over and we're going to
 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.189
turn them over and we're going to
shuffle them and you decide which one to

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199
shuffle them and you decide which one to
 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.200
shuffle them and you decide which one to
shuffle but the shuffling means always

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210
shuffle but the shuffling means always
 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.290
shuffle but the shuffling means always
to take the top card and put it at the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300
to take the top card and put it at the
 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:21.740
to take the top card and put it at the
bottom

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
bottom
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.390
bottom
that's shuffling okay that's one shuffle

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400
that's shuffling okay that's one shuffle
 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.900
that's shuffling okay that's one shuffle
and each time we shove it you tell me

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910
and each time we shove it you tell me
 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.310
and each time we shove it you tell me
which went which ones shuffle I'll

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
which went which ones shuffle I'll
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.240
which went which ones shuffle I'll
shuffle that one

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
shuffle that one
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.430
shuffle that one
okay so let's shuffle number of times

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
okay so let's shuffle number of times
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.920
okay so let's shuffle number of times
well what can we say oh let's use the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
well what can we say oh let's use the
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.720
well what can we say oh let's use the
phrase numberphile shall we so

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
phrase numberphile shall we so
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.880
phrase numberphile shall we so
numberphile and you mb ER ph IL e so for

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890
numberphile and you mb ER ph IL e so for
 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410
numberphile and you mb ER ph IL e so for
each of these letters you say welsh a

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420
each of these letters you say welsh a
 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.119
each of these letters you say welsh a
for the right one or the left one and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129
for the right one or the left one and
 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.740
for the right one or the left one and
you can say you know numb3rs whatever

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750
you can say you know numb3rs whatever
 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.869
you can say you know numb3rs whatever
you like okay so brady you tell me which

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
you like okay so brady you tell me which
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.760
you like okay so brady you tell me which
one to shuffle them so left or right and

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770
one to shuffle them so left or right and
 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.009
one to shuffle them so left or right and
so and yeah you you mmm

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019
so and yeah you you mmm
 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:18.550
so and yeah you you mmm
may be yes sorry our p t HH alright i ll

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560
 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.700
okay so those two cards emerged to the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
okay so those two cards emerged to the
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.429
okay so those two cards emerged to the
top as a result of your choice I didn't

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
top as a result of your choice I didn't
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.109
top as a result of your choice I didn't
choose this so I'm going to set them

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
choose this so I'm going to set them
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:27.440
choose this so I'm going to set them
aside

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
aside
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.600
aside
yeah two of them now we repeat

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
yeah two of them now we repeat
 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.999
yeah two of them now we repeat
numberphile again and for each of those

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009
numberphile again and for each of those
 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.880
numberphile again and for each of those
letters we shuffle either of these and

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890
letters we shuffle either of these and
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.469
letters we shuffle either of these and
you choose which ones shuffle for each

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479
you choose which ones shuffle for each
 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.060
you choose which ones shuffle for each
of those data so which one do you want

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
of those data so which one do you want
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:53.300
of those data so which one do you want
oh my god so okay M &amp; u M R th I L II I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310
oh my god so okay M &amp; u M R th I L II I
 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.490
oh my god so okay M &amp; u M R th I L II I
wasn't expecting this okay those two

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500
wasn't expecting this okay those two
 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260
wasn't expecting this okay those two
cars emerged to top in fact this one

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270
cars emerged to top in fact this one
 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.050
cars emerged to top in fact this one
didn't move but this image the pop so I

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
didn't move but this image the pop so I
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.109
didn't move but this image the pop so I
put this aside now one last time

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119
put this aside now one last time
 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.950
put this aside now one last time
numberphile

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
numberphile
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.340
numberphile
and you choose which one to shuffle and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350
and you choose which one to shuffle and
 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.460
and you choose which one to shuffle and
you baby

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
you baby

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.910
oh okay now if we were really lucky and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920
oh okay now if we were really lucky and
 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.010
oh okay now if we were really lucky and
luck doesn't come except to the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
luck doesn't come except to the

number

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470
number
 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.900
number
you know number five means liking

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910
you know number five means liking
 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.490
you know number five means liking
numbers and these two numbers like each

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500
numbers and these two numbers like each
 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.330
numbers and these two numbers like each
other of course

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340
other of course
 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.400
other of course
two and two but that might have been

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410
two and two but that might have been
 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.610
two and two but that might have been
luck but if we really believe in that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620
luck but if we really believe in that
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.310
luck but if we really believe in that
magical number file these two might have

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320
magical number file these two might have
 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.950
magical number file these two might have
matched remember you chose which one to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960
matched remember you chose which one to
 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.740
matched remember you chose which one to
shuffle yeah I didn't that's surely not

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
shuffle yeah I didn't that's surely not
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.630
shuffle yeah I didn't that's surely not
possible but what's really impossible

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640
possible but what's really impossible
 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.630
possible but what's really impossible
would be impossible is for the next to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640
would be impossible is for the next to
 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.610
would be impossible is for the next to
the match and the surprised but

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620
the match and the surprised but
 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.670
the match and the surprised but
surprised last to ho so much so they all

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680
surprised last to ho so much so they all
 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.750
surprised last to ho so much so they all
match otherwise I mean it wasn't magic

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760
match otherwise I mean it wasn't magic
 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.699
match otherwise I mean it wasn't magic
so the trick that I have just shown you

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709
so the trick that I have just shown you
 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.920
so the trick that I have just shown you
is a classic trick which was described

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930
is a classic trick which was described
 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.360
is a classic trick which was described
for the first time as far as I know by

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370
for the first time as far as I know by
 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.190
for the first time as far as I know by
the late Martin Gardner called the last

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200
the late Martin Gardner called the last
 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.220
the late Martin Gardner called the last
cards match and I made a variation on

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230
cards match and I made a variation on
 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.800
cards match and I made a variation on
this and the variation is a little

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810
this and the variation is a little
 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.449
this and the variation is a little
slower than the original trick but it's

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459
slower than the original trick but it's
 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.340
slower than the original trick but it's
also mathematically more interesting so

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350
also mathematically more interesting so
 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.560
also mathematically more interesting so
I'd like to reveal the secret what we

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570
I'd like to reveal the secret what we
 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.050
I'd like to reveal the secret what we
had was two powers of cars you have one

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060
had was two powers of cars you have one
 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.830
had was two powers of cars you have one
two three four in one order and one two

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840
two three four in one order and one two
 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.690
two three four in one order and one two
three four or if you like four three two

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700
three four or if you like four three two
 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.940
three four or if you like four three two
one in the reverse order and these

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950
one in the reverse order and these
 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.729
one in the reverse order and these
should be thought of as like clocks okay

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739
should be thought of as like clocks okay
 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.460
should be thought of as like clocks okay
so a clock has you know one two three

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470
so a clock has you know one two three
 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.229
so a clock has you know one two three
four all the way to 12 and then it

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239
four all the way to 12 and then it
 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.100
four all the way to 12 and then it
starts all over again

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110
starts all over again
 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.620
starts all over again
so you are doing modular arithmetic here

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630
so you are doing modular arithmetic here
 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.350
so you are doing modular arithmetic here
also if you go one two three four and if

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360
also if you go one two three four and if
 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.210
also if you go one two three four and if
you want to go five you hear six years

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220
you want to go five you hear six years
 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.949
you want to go five you hear six years
seven here eight here and so we can keep

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959
seven here eight here and so we can keep
 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.710
seven here eight here and so we can keep
going okay you remember that our way of

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720
going okay you remember that our way of
 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.390
going okay you remember that our way of
shuffling was very special we took the

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400
shuffling was very special we took the
 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.370
shuffling was very special we took the
top card and then put it at the bottom

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380
top card and then put it at the bottom
 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.699
top card and then put it at the bottom
so you as you keep repeating this you

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
so you as you keep repeating this you
 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:11.690
so you as you keep repeating this you
are cyclically

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700
are cyclically
 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.699
are cyclically
or cyclically depending on the side of

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709
or cyclically depending on the side of
 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.759
or cyclically depending on the side of
the Atlantic permuting those cards so

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769
the Atlantic permuting those cards so
 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.159
the Atlantic permuting those cards so
you go from here to here to here to here

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169
you go from here to here to here to here
 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.599
you go from here to here to here to here
and keep going

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609
and keep going
 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.690
and keep going
whereas in the other deck which had the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700
whereas in the other deck which had the
 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.970
whereas in the other deck which had the
reverse order you go from

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980
reverse order you go from
 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.420
reverse order you go from
to here to here to here okay we had four

with any number of cards in Jack let's

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700
with any number of cards in Jack let's
 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.660
with any number of cards in Jack let's
say that you have cards one two three

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:37.670

was some number more generally which was
chosen to be some number which is

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:07.070

congrat minus 1 modulo M where m is the
 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.570
congrat minus 1 modulo M where m is the
number of cars in each deck so for us M

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:13.580
number of cars in each deck so for us M
 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.440
number of cars in each deck so for us M
was 4 and for us 11 was chosen number

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:17.450
was 4 and for us 11 was chosen number
 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.690

pulled that minus one more time and
 

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.090
pulled that minus one more time and
we'll see why this minus 1 becomes

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:25.100
we'll see why this minus 1 becomes
 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.130
we'll see why this minus 1 becomes
useful in a moment that's that's part of

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:27.140
useful in a moment that's that's part of
 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.980
useful in a moment that's that's part of
the magic you have to do magic at some

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990
the magic you have to do magic at some
 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.190
the magic you have to do magic at some
point okay so let's see what L plus 1 is

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:33.200
point okay so let's see what L plus 1 is
 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:35.560
point okay so let's see what L plus 1 is
compared with M minus R and we'll see

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:35.570
compared with M minus R and we'll see
 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.820
compared with M minus R and we'll see
that they are actually the same thing

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:36.830
that they are actually the same thing
 

00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:39.970
that they are actually the same thing
you see because L we see is equal to

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:39.980
you see because L we see is equal to
 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:43.180
you see because L we see is equal to
look at this L plus R equals minus 1 or

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190
look at this L plus R equals minus 1 or
 

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.670
look at this L plus R equals minus 1 or
concrete minus 1 so l equals minus 1

00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:45.680
concrete minus 1 so l equals minus 1
 

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:52.750
concrete minus 1 so l equals minus 1
minus R let's not forget plus 1 so minus

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:52.760
minus R let's not forget plus 1 so minus
 

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:54.760
minus R let's not forget plus 1 so minus
1 plus 1 cancel and you are left with

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:54.770
1 plus 1 cancel and you are left with
 

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:00.160
1 plus 1 cancel and you are left with
only minus R so this is modulo M but

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:00.170
only minus R so this is modulo M but
 

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:03.430
only minus R so this is modulo M but
minus R can be written by modulus neck

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440
minus R can be written by modulus neck
 

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.590
minus R can be written by modulus neck
again as M minus R that's the same thing

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:05.600
again as M minus R that's the same thing
 

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:10.570
again as M minus R that's the same thing
with you am doing it like that ok and so

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:10.580
with you am doing it like that ok and so
 

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.470
with you am doing it like that ok and so
what we see is that module M L plus 1

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:14.480
what we see is that module M L plus 1
 

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.510
what we see is that module M L plus 1
the top of the red deck and M minus R

00:08:18.510 --> 00:08:18.520
the top of the red deck and M minus R
 

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.330
the top of the red deck and M minus R
top of the black deck actually the same

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:22.340
top of the black deck actually the same
 

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.870
top of the black deck actually the same
so after those shuffles the same cars

00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:25.880
so after those shuffles the same cars
 

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:29.290
so after those shuffles the same cars
emerge on the top you put them aside now

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:29.300
emerge on the top you put them aside now
 

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.660
emerge on the top you put them aside now
you have to start over again and then

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:31.670
you have to start over again and then
 

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.810
you have to start over again and then
the number of cars M changes but that's

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:34.820
the number of cars M changes but that's
 

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.260
the number of cars M changes but that's
where minus 1 becomes useful 11 that we

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:38.270
where minus 1 becomes useful 11 that we
 

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.540
