00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.860
In this lesson, we're going to learn how you,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.910
yes you, can in the comfort of your own

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.260
kitchen, extract raw DNA from living cells and see

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.900
it with the naked eye. DNA is a really,

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.590
really long naturally occurring molecule. In fact, you've

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.140
got over 6 feet of it packed into almost

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.240
every one of the cells in your body. How do you think that 6 feet of DNA fits

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.600
into a single cell? Could it be that DNA is long but really, really thin? Or

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.730
maybe it's highly organized by proteins. Or maybe

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.530
it's divided into more individual or mobile units

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.830
within a cell. Or maybe all the cells in your body have to expand to 6

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.009
feet in width. Go ahead and pick any and all answers that you think are best.
