about the greatest love
I've ever had.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.473
It was four weeks long

00:01:13.506 --> 00:01:16.375
and then we broke up
for over a year.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:18.411
True love, guys.

Drunk as fuck
in a liquor store parking lot

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.421
after I was at Red Lobster

00:01:28.454 --> 00:01:31.758
for my best friend's
53rd birthday.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.095
And I was 26.
So that's where I was

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:40.099
That's where I was.

00:01:40.132 --> 00:01:41.767
So we're drunk as shit
at Red Lobster

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.569
and we're like,
let's get more booze.

00:01:43.602 --> 00:01:44.770
We're in a liquor store
parking lot,

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.806
I see a lady with cool pants.

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:50.443
I'm a smooth motherfucker,
so I told her, hey,

00:01:50.476 --> 00:01:52.745
you got dope ass pants.

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.848
And we just started
making out.

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:57.984
Right there in the parking lot.

00:01:58.017 --> 00:02:02.121

go to an alley.

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:08.361

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:13.599
Too much!

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.134
But I was very into this girl.

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:16.802
I was so into this girl.
She had a shaved head.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:19.038
I was like,
this is exotic.

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:20.640
This is so exotic.

00:02:20.673 --> 00:02:22.808
Turns out later,
she had had lice.

00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:26.279
That's why she had
a shaved head.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.047
I didn't know that then.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.816
I thought it was
a fashion choice.

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.586
It was a health choice.

00:02:35.487 --> 00:02:39.125
'Cause she had had dreadlocks
'cause she was a trustafarian.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.827
I don't know if you know
what this is.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.064
It's a trust fund hippie.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:49.368
It's a hippie who has not
earned the lifestyle.

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.072
Yeah, she's not the best.
Okay, not a great--

00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:55.174
not a great persona
for hippies, all right?

00:02:55.207 --> 00:02:57.176
'Cause, like, she'd tell me a
lot about the hippie lifestyle.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.012
And that is the most important
part about being a hippie

00:03:00.045 --> 00:03:04.584
is having parents
who started a business.

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.252
'Cause you need money
to be a hippie.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.721
You need money to not
give a shit about the world.

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.590
It's very important.

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.593
There's no hippies
at Quiznos, you know?

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:16.262
Like, you need to be able
to have no job.

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:17.830
You can't be like,
dude, fuck the world.

00:03:17.863 --> 00:03:19.198
They're like, yeah, it's fine.

00:03:19.231 --> 00:03:21.367
I ordered
the Baja chicken sandwich.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.870
I would like it right now.

00:03:25.037 --> 00:03:26.739
But she taught me
about being a hippie.

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.941
And I was into it.
I was like, this is cool.

00:03:28.974 --> 00:03:31.744
This is all great, this is all
fantastic, this is wonderful.

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:34.247
And two weeks into
meeting this lovely lady,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.284
we went to Maui and we went to
her house that she had.

00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:41.554
We broke into it.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:46.892
We did and we rented mopeds in
Maui and she took her top off

00:03:46.925 --> 00:03:48.294
on the mopeds
while we're riding around.

00:03:48.327 --> 00:03:50.062
I was like,
there's people around.

00:03:50.095 --> 00:03:51.897
She's like, it doesn't matter.
And I'm like,

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.932
you're the coolest motherfucker
I've ever met.

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:54.867
Like, this is amazing.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.736
You don't care who sees your
boobs! This is crazy!

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.238
This is amazing!

00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:00.940
And then we stopped
at a beach.

00:04:00.973 --> 00:04:03.075
And she had a fanny pack.

00:04:03.108 --> 00:04:07.247
And she pulled out of the fanny
pack weed, coke and molly.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:11.751
Which is too much.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:13.919
That's too much.

00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:17.990
I was like, what?
Why all three on this daytrip?

00:04:18.023 --> 00:04:19.225
How come?

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:22.395
Leave two at home.
Let's pick one.

00:04:22.428 --> 00:04:24.930
Let's pick--this is
a different crime, now.

00:04:24.963 --> 00:04:26.465
This is--this is
a different crime.

00:04:26.498 --> 00:04:28.267
If we get caught with weed,
they're like,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.835
look at these lovebirds.

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:31.003
If we get caught with weed,
coke and molly,

00:04:31.036 --> 00:04:34.173
we're fuckin' drug kingpins.

00:04:34.206 --> 00:04:36.776
And I think you're fantastic
And I'm gonna be chivalrous.

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:38.010
And I'm gonna jump
on their grenade

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:39.278
and be like, it's all my drugs,

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.113
get out of here, babe!

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:43.015
You're a crazy hippie.
You're gonna forget

00:04:43.048 --> 00:04:45.318
you dated me in four hours.

00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:48.754
And I'm just gonna be
in jail for a while.

00:04:48.787 --> 00:04:53.592
But we took the molly
and, um--

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.762
We went snorkeling.

00:04:56.795 --> 00:05:00.166
Those are two fantastic things

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.335
Those are two
amazing things.

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:05.971
Molly's great.
Snorkeling's great.

00:05:06.004 --> 00:05:08.974
Combine 'em, holy shit.

00:05:09.007 --> 00:05:10.976
I don't care who you're with.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.712
If you snorkel
with someone on molly,

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.848
you will fall in love
immediately.

00:05:15.881 --> 00:05:17.383
That--I don't give a shit.

00:05:17.416 --> 00:05:20.886
If I snorkeled on molly
with Donald Trump,

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:22.655
I would be up here right now
being like,

00:05:22.688 --> 00:05:25.324
you don't know him
like I do!

00:05:25.357 --> 00:05:28.160
You don't know him!

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:32.231
We held hands and a turtle
swam underneath us.

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:35.668
His hair looked like
spaghetti down there.

00:05:35.701 --> 00:05:38.871
He's a beautiful man!

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.808
So we had a great time
in Hawaii.

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:44.210
Fantastic time.
Fell in love.

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:45.978
Told each other
we loved each other.

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:47.680
She told me--we were 26--
she told me,

00:05:47.713 --> 00:05:49.682
she's like, I've been proposed
to three different times.

00:05:49.715 --> 00:05:50.883
I was like, wow,
that's crazy.

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:54.086
Uh, red flag! Um--

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:59.592
But in my brain, I was like,
those guys are suckers. Like--

00:05:59.625 --> 00:06:01.026
So we come back to Los Angeles.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:03.162
We come back to reality.
And we're here.

00:06:03.195 --> 00:06:06.098
And she comes over to my house
four days after we get back.

00:06:06.131 --> 00:06:07.700
She comes over to the house
like four in the morning.

00:06:07.733 --> 00:06:10.002
And she's on molly.
And looking back.

00:06:10.035 --> 00:06:11.837
I don't know
if she ever wasn't.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.006
I'm not sure.

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:15.741
But she came back.
And I was like,

00:06:15.774 --> 00:06:17.843
oh, so good to see you,
it's like, four in the morning.

00:06:17.876 --> 00:06:19.445
And she was like,
we have to break up.

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:20.913
And I was like,
terrible to see you!

00:06:20.946 --> 00:06:23.015
Never mind!
This is terrible.

00:06:23.048 --> 00:06:24.917
Why--why do we
have to break up?

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.121
And she just goes,
we have different spirits.

00:06:29.154 --> 00:06:33.225
And I was like, what?

00:06:33.258 --> 00:06:34.894
What do you want
my spirit to be?

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.762
I'll change it. Like, what--

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.597
Do you want my spirit
to also love

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:40.232
the String Cheese Incident?

00:06:40.265 --> 00:06:42.101
That's fine. It could love
the String Cheese--

00:06:42.134 --> 00:06:43.903
Do you want my spirit
to know more than three

00:06:43.936 --> 00:06:45.237
Grateful Dead songs?

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.906
I'll learn.
Like, just teach me

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.207
what you want
my spirit to be.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.775
And she's like,
I can't do this.

00:06:49.808 --> 00:06:51.076
And she left
and then before she left,

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:52.445
I was like, marry me!

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:56.115
And that was
four times for her.

00:06:56.148 --> 00:06:59.585
Yeah, so she leaves.

00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:02.054
And I don't see her for
a while and I'm bumming.

00:07:02.087 --> 00:07:03.889
And a few months go by.

00:07:03.922 --> 00:07:05.925
I play it cool.
I don't hit her up.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:09.462
And at this time,
I'm trying to do acting.

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:12.765
And my manager and agent
are like, you're bad at acting.

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:14.767
You gotta take
an acting class.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.236
And I was like, why?
I thought I was

00:07:17.269 --> 00:07:19.305
crushing it in those auditions.

00:07:19.338 --> 00:07:20.806
And they're like,
our feedback

00:07:20.839 --> 00:07:25.444
is that you shake
and apologize.

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:27.179
And I was like, oh, yeah.

00:07:27.212 --> 00:07:31.350
Yeah, I do. But if I got
the job I won't, you know?

00:07:31.383 --> 00:07:33.686
I'll have the job. There's no
nerves anymore, you know.

00:07:33.719 --> 00:07:35.454
They're like, you have to
take an acting class.

00:07:35.487 --> 00:07:37.323
I was like, fine.
I'll take this acting class.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:39.925
So I go to this acting class
and it sucks.

00:07:39.958 --> 00:07:43.362
If you've never taken one,
don't.

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:44.697
They're boring.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.365
I'm sitting there,
it's very boring

00:07:46.398 --> 00:07:49.468
and then, out of nowhere,
I get a text from this girl.

00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:51.370
It's been three months
and she just texted me.

00:07:51.403 --> 00:07:53.839
She's like, do you wanna
get coffee now?

00:07:53.872 --> 00:07:55.975
And I, like, looked at it,

00:07:56.008 --> 00:07:57.443
and I put my phone
in my pocket,

00:07:57.476 --> 00:08:00.279
and I did the best acting
I'd ever done.

00:08:00.312 --> 00:08:03.816
I just stood up and I go,
my friend was in a car wreck!

00:08:03.849 --> 00:08:06.218
And I left.

00:08:06.251 --> 00:08:08.954
I left--so they didn't even
see me look at my phone.

00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:10.322
In their brain,
they're like, that guy

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.291
got some intuition
or something.

00:08:12.324 --> 00:08:13.826
I was like, my friend
just got in a car wreck

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:16.195
I gotta go right now! Like--

00:08:16.228 --> 00:08:18.864
I ran. I got in my car
and I drove

00:08:18.897 --> 00:08:20.666
to this coffee shop
down on Sunset,

00:08:20.699 --> 00:08:22.067
not far from here.

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:23.469
And I sat with her.
And I was like,

00:08:23.502 --> 00:08:25.004
so in my stupid male brain
I'm like,

00:08:25.037 --> 00:08:26.338
we're back together,
right baby!

00:08:26.371 --> 00:08:28.040
You know, and she's like,
oh, no,

00:08:28.073 --> 00:08:29.208
I just, like, wanted to see
how you are.

00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:30.576
I'm seeing someone else now.

00:08:30.609 --> 00:08:32.177
And I was like oh, God, why?

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.414
No, like--and I immediately
started crying.

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:37.216
And she was like,
I can't deal with this.

00:08:37.249 --> 00:08:39.218
You know, I understand.

00:08:39.251 --> 00:08:43.355
And she left
and I was sitting there crying.

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:46.025
And also never went back
to my acting class.

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.561
My career has suffered
for that.

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:54.099
Never went back,
sitting there crying.

00:08:54.132 --> 00:08:55.668
I was so bummed after this.

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:58.337
It was so devastating.
I was so devastated,

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.739
I started listening to, like,
Nine Inch Nails

00:09:00.772 --> 00:09:04.043
and getting it.

00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:06.378
That's a bad place to be
in your life.

00:09:06.411 --> 00:09:08.414
You never wanna hear
Trent Reznor lyrics

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:11.651
and be like,
that is how it is!

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:15.187
Like, I had these
crazy ideas to get her back.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.755
I was like,
I know what I'll do.

00:09:16.788 --> 00:09:18.424
She thought I was lame,
I didn't like snakes.

00:09:18.457 --> 00:09:20.192
I'll go to a pet store,
I'll hold a snake

00:09:20.225 --> 00:09:21.527
and I'll send a photo
and be like,

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.728
look how brave I am!

00:09:22.761 --> 00:09:24.229
Like, that's how crazy I was.

00:09:24.262 --> 00:09:25.297
But I didn't do it 'cause
I'm scared of snakes

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:27.199
and that's ridiculous.

00:09:27.232 --> 00:09:28.567
And people are like,
don't be afraid of snakes.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.768
I'm like, don't be weird.

00:09:29.801 --> 00:09:31.937
You know, like, that's really--

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.405
People who like snakes
are weird.

00:09:33.438 --> 00:09:34.607
They're like, snakes
are more afraid

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.975
of humans than them.

00:09:36.008 --> 00:09:37.910
I'm like, fuck you.
No, they're not.

00:09:37.943 --> 00:09:40.212
Snakes never took acid
in Joshua Tree

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:43.115
then had a meltdown.

00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:47.219
I never seen a snake
crawl on top of a van

00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:48.654
and be like,
there's people down there.

00:09:48.687 --> 00:09:51.290
You know, like, I don't--
it's different.

00:09:54.192 --> 00:09:56.328
So time goes by.

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:58.097
Like, six months.
I slowly get over it.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:09:59.898
Like, slowly build over it,
build over it.

00:09:59.931 --> 00:10:02.167
And then I get put on this
program, "Saturday Night Live."

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.136
Which was cool,
but the only reason

00:10:04.169 --> 00:10:05.771
I really got excited
to be on it

00:10:05.804 --> 00:10:07.606
was because she would know.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:09.141
Like, that's really-
they were like, you're on

00:10:09.174 --> 00:10:10.909
"Saturday Night Live,"
how great.

00:10:10.942 --> 00:10:12.578
I'm like, she's gonna find out.
And they're like, who?

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:15.514
I was like, never mind.
This is great.

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:17.249
'Cause I knew she watched
"Saturday Night"--

00:10:17.282 --> 00:10:19.952
She watched that show.
And no offense,

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:21.253
she--she's kinda dumb.

00:10:21.286 --> 00:10:22.821
The show is kinda
for dumb people.

00:10:22.854 --> 00:10:25.524
It is--it's for high school
kids and then

00:10:25.557 --> 00:10:27.626
you grow out of it, unless
you're kind of a dumb adult.

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:30.629
And would I be saying this if
they had not fired me?

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:32.631
Fuck no.

00:10:32.664 --> 00:10:35.134
I'd be like, it's the number
one hit show ever!

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:38.704
But I got fired.
So, whatever.

00:10:38.737 --> 00:10:41.473
I was just excited to be on it
'cause I knew she'd find out.

00:10:41.506 --> 00:10:44.877
And so once I got on and I do,
like, a couple episodes.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:48.180
I sent her a real petty email.

00:10:48.213 --> 00:10:50.482
Oh, wait, hold on.
I forgot about

00:10:50.515 --> 00:10:53.218
the greatest gift she gave me.

00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:55.387
Right after we broke up,
it was a few weeks,

00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.057
and I found out that she had
actually given me a present.

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.658
And that present was scabies.

00:10:59.691 --> 00:11:01.393
[crowd groaning]

00:11:01.426 --> 00:11:04.730
Yeah. I had gotten
scabies from this girl.

00:11:04.763 --> 00:11:07.166
Which is a skin disease
pirates get

00:11:07.199 --> 00:11:10.536
when they fuck dirt.

00:11:13.205 --> 00:11:14.673
So I had gotten scabies
from her.

00:11:14.706 --> 00:11:18.677
I forgot about
that part of the story.

00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:20.679
But she wasn't even around
to cuddle while I itched.

00:11:20.712 --> 00:11:23.682
You know, it's usually
a really itchy disease.

00:11:23.715 --> 00:11:25.250
So, like, I sent her
this email

00:11:25.283 --> 00:11:26.652
when I got on that show.

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:28.754
And I was like--
basically, it was petty.

00:11:28.787 --> 00:11:31.590
I was just like--
the title was basically,

00:11:31.623 --> 00:11:33.425
"You Suck."
You know, like--

00:11:33.458 --> 00:11:35.327
I was like,
I loved you so much,

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.263
All you gave me was scabies.
You're a mean person.

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:40.232
Send.
And I was like-- [sighs]

00:11:40.265 --> 00:11:43.368
And right away, I got
an email back from her

00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:45.370
that was just like,
I'm sorry.

00:11:45.403 --> 00:11:49.174
Like, I apologize.
I was immature,

00:11:49.207 --> 00:11:50.709
I was going though some things.

00:11:50.742 --> 00:11:54.246
And I just, you know,
I didn't behave properly.

00:11:54.279 --> 00:11:55.881
And I was like, oh, wow,
that's very nice.

00:11:55.914 --> 00:11:57.516
Like, how do I
respond to this?

00:11:57.549 --> 00:11:58.917
And then I go,
I know how to respond.

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.352
I don't say fuckin' nothin',

00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:02.721
and then I win
this relationship.

00:12:02.754 --> 00:12:04.456
Like, I have
the upper hand right now.

00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:06.225
This is great.
So, like, I didn't respond.

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.527
I walked around
with my head held high.

00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.563
For, like six months.
I was like, yeah, you won.

00:12:11.596 --> 00:12:13.799
You won that relationship.
This is fantastic.

00:12:13.832 --> 00:12:17.736
And then, six months later,
I saw the movie "Descendents,"

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:19.738
which happens in Hawaii.

00:12:19.771 --> 00:12:21.607
And I was like,
I miss her so bad!

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.308
And I sent her, like,
a three page email

00:12:23.341 --> 00:12:24.543
being like, you have
a beautiful soul.

00:12:24.576 --> 00:12:26.211
I'm sorry for my mean email.

00:12:26.244 --> 00:12:28.313
And she never responded
to that email.

00:12:28.346 --> 00:12:30.816
So she actually won
the fuckin' relationship.

00:12:30.849 --> 00:12:34.286
I fumbled it
at the two yard line.

00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:39.324
Sucks so bad.
But I'm very lucky

00:12:39.357 --> 00:12:41.393
that she broke up with me
because I would've

00:12:41.426 --> 00:12:42.895
done anything for this person.

00:12:42.928 --> 00:12:44.730
Like, I was crazy.
I was out of my mind.

00:12:44.763 --> 00:12:46.665
Like, I wouldn't be doing
stand-up comedy right now.

00:12:46.698 --> 00:12:48.934
That's the truth.
I wouldn't be up here talking,

00:12:48.967 --> 00:12:50.335
doing stand-up comedy.

00:12:50.368 --> 00:12:53.438
I would be in
a tree house somewhere

00:12:53.471 --> 00:12:56.141
pretending to like poetry.

00:12:56.174 --> 00:13:00.445
Like, wearing a leather vest
with a beaded falcon on it.

00:13:00.478 --> 00:13:03.182
You know, like,
that's what I would've

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:05.083
been doing, you know, like--

00:13:05.116 --> 00:13:07.653
So thank God we broke up.

00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:09.288
But, you know,
that relationship

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:11.089
was all based off of
one simple thing.

00:13:11.122 --> 00:13:14.760
Some really dope fucking pants.

00:13:14.793 --> 00:13:16.295
That--

00:13:16.328 --> 00:13:17.763
But that's not really true.

00:13:17.796 --> 00:13:19.798
It was mostly
molly and snorkeling.

00:13:19.831 --> 00:13:22.501
So that's my story.
Thank you guys very, very much.

00:13:22.534 --> 00:13:24.837
[cheers and applause]

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:27.907
