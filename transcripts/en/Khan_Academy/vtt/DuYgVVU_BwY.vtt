00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.690
We're asked to graph, y is
equal to log base 5 of x.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.780
And just to remind us
what this is saying,

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.240
this is saying that y
is equal to the power

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.460
that I have to raise
5 to to get to x.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.980
Or if I were to write
this logarithmic equation

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.510
as an exponential
equation, 5 is my base,

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.640
y is the exponent that I
have to raise my base to,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.420
and then x is what I get when
I raise 5 to the yth power.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.570
So another way of writing
this equation would be 5

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:40.710
to the y'th power is
going to be equal to x.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.010
These are the same thing.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.480
Here, we have y as
a function of x.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.550
Here, we have x as
a function of y.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.980
But they're really saying
the exact same thing,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.624
raise 5 to the y'th
power to get x.

00:00:53.624 --> 00:00:55.790
When you put it as a
logarithm, you're saying, well,

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.010
what power do I have
to raise 5 to to get x?

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.440
We'll have to raise it to y.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.940
Here, what do I get when I
raise five to the y power?

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.099
I get x.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:07.200
That out of the way, let's
make ourselves a little table

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.710
that we can use to
plot some points,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.335
and then we can
connect the dots to see

00:01:10.335 --> 00:01:11.980
what this curve looks like.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.940
So let me pick some
x's and some y's.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.100
And we, in general, want to
pick some numbers that give us

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.689
some nice round answers, some
nice fairly simple numbers

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.230
for us to deal with,
so that we don't

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.760
have to get the calculator.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.590
And so in general,
you want to pick

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.250
x values where the power
that you have to raise 5

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.156
to to get that x value is a
pretty straightforward power.

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:39.530
Or another way to
think about it,

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.810
you could just think about
the different y values

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.740
that you want to raise
5 to the power of,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.360
and then you could
get your x values.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.590
So we could actually
think about this one

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.510
to come up with our
actual x values.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.370
But we want to be clear that
when we express it like this,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.850
the independent variable is x,
and the dependent variable is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.480
y.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.660
We might just look at
this one to pick some nice

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.440
even or nice x's that give
us nice clean answers for y.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.690
So here, I'm actually going
to fill in the y first,

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.820
just so we get nice clean x's.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.500
So let's say we're
going to raise five

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.120
to the-- let's say we're going
to raise it-- I'm going to pick

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.820
some new colors-- negative
2, negative 2 power--

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.490
and let me do some other
colors-- negative 1, 0, 1.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.620
I'll do one more, and then 2.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.660
So once again, this is
a little nontraditional,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.890
where I'm filling in the
dependent variable first.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.300
But the way that
we've written it over

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.290
here, it's actually given
the dependent variable,

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.750
it's easy to figure out what
the independent variable needs

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.130
to be for this
logarithmic function.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.420
So, what x gives me
a y of negative 2?

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.640
What x gives me--
what does x have

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.430
to be for y to be
equal to negative 2?

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.590
Well, 5 to the negative 2 power
is going to be equal to x.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.480
So 5 to the negative
2 is 1 over 25.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.440
So we get 1 over 25.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.000
If we go back to
this earlier one,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.200
if we say log base
5 of 1 over 25,

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.530
what power do I have to
raise 5 to to get 1 over 25?

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.420
We'll have to raise it
to the negative 2 power.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.110
Or you could say 5
to the negative 2

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.460
is equal to 1 over 25.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:27.960
These are saying the
exact same thing.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:30.160
Now let's do another one.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.100
What happens when I raise
5 to the negative 1 power?

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.487
I get one fifth.

00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:37.320
So if we go to this
original one over there,

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.670
we're just saying that
log base 5 of one fifth.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.210
Want to be careful.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.810
This is saying, what power
do I have to raise 5 to

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.130
in order to get one fifth.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.640
We'll have to raise it
to the negative 1 power.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.080
What happens when I take
5 to the 0'th power?

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.249
I get one.

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.290
And so this relationship--
This is the same thing

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.650
as saying log base 5 of 1.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.430
What power do I have
to raise 5 to to get 1?

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.910
I just have to raise
it to the 0th power.

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.660
Let's do the next two.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.470
What happens when I raise
5 to the first power?

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.180
Well, I get 5 So if you go look
over here, that's just saying,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.410
log, what power do I have
to raise 5 to to get 5?

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.880
We'll have to just raise
it to the first power.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.800
And then finally, if I
take 5 squared, I get 25.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.680
So when you look at it from
the logarithmic point of view,

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.410
you say, well, what power
do I have to raise 5 to

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.020
to get to 25?

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.930
We'll have to raise it
to the second power.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.830
So I took the inverse of
the logarithmic function.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.550
I wrote it as an
exponential function.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.270
I switched the dependent
and independent variables,

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.760
so I can derive nice clean x's
that will give me nice clean

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:51.734
y's.

00:04:51.734 --> 00:04:54.150
Now with that out of the way,
but I do want to remind you,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.497
I could have just picked
random numbers over here,

00:04:57.497 --> 00:04:59.830
but then I would have probably
gotten less clean numbers

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:00.260
over here.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.510
I would have had to
use a calculator.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.093
The only reason why
I did it this way,

00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:06.810
is so I get nice clean results
that I can plot by hand.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.740
So let's actually graph it.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.910
Let's actually graph
this thing over here.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.570
So the y's go between
negative 2 and 2.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.650
The x's go from 1/25th
all the way to 25.

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.680
So let's graph it.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:30.050
So that is my y-axis,
and this is my x-axis.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.116
Draw it like that.

00:05:32.116 --> 00:05:34.190
That is my x-axis.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:37.340
And then the y's start at 0.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:42.520
Then, you get to
positive 1, positive 2.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.940
And then you have negative 1.

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.230
And you have negative 2.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.720
And then on the x-axis,
it's all positive.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.180
And I'll let you think about
whether the domain here

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.080
is-- well, when you
think about it--

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.270
is a logarithmic
function defined

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.050
for an x that is not positive?

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.190
So is there any power that I can
raise five to that I can get 0?

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.370
No.

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:11.120
You could raise five to an
infinitely negative power

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.720
to get a very, very, very, very
small number that approaches

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.840
zero, but you can
never get-- there's

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.260
no power that you can
raise 5 to to get 0.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.799
So x cannot be 0.

00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:21.590
And there's no power
then you could raise 5

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.030
to get another negative number.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.785
So x can also not be
a negative number.

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:28.160
So the domain of this function
right over here-- and this

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.410
is relevant, because we want
to think about what we're

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.500
graphing-- the domain here is
x has to be greater than zero.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.230
Let me write that down.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:39.675
The domain here is that x
has to be greater than 0.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:41.300
So we're only going
to be able to graph

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.660
this function in
the positive x-axis.

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.380
So with that out of the
way, x gets as large as 25.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.150
So let me graph-- we
put those points here.

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.430
So that is 5, 10,
15, 20, and 25.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.884
And then let's plot these.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:00.050
So the first one is in blue.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.720
When x is 1/25 and
y is negative 2--

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.090
When x is 1/25 so
1 is there-- 1/25

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.940
is going to be really close to
there-- Then y is negative 2.

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.680
So it's going to be
like right over there,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.190
not quite at the y-axis.

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.040
We're at 1/25 to the
right of the y-axis.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.996
But pretty close.

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:19.120
So that's right over there.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.680
That is 1 over 25, comma
negative 2 right over there.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:26.270
Then, when x is one
fifth, which is slightly

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.550
further to the right, one
fifth y is negative 1.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.880
So right over there.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.950
So this is one
fifth, negative 1.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.290
Then when x is 1, y is 0.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:43.310
So 1 might be right there.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:46.550
So this is the point 1,0.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.630
And then when x is 5, y is 1.

00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.180
When x is 5, I covered it
over here, when this is five,

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.530
y is 1.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:59.280
So that's the point 5,1.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.200
And then finally,
when x is 25, y is 2.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.140
So this is 25,2.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.050
And then I can
graph the function.

00:08:13.050 --> 00:08:17.030
And I'll do it-- let me do it
in a color-- I'll use this pink.

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:23.550
So as x gets super, super,
super, super small, y goes

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.820
to negative infinity.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.490
It gets really small-- to
get x's or as x becomes--

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:34.179
if you say what power do
you have to raise 5 to

00:08:34.179 --> 00:08:36.539
to get 0.0001?

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:38.530
It has to be very, very,
very negative power.

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:43.090
So y is going to be very
negative as we approach 0.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:47.390
And then it kind of
moves up like that.

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:53.110
And then starts to kind of
curve to the right like that.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.840
And this thing
right over here, is

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:58.890
going to keep going down at
a steeper and steeper rate.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.160
And it's never going
to quite touch.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.060
the y-axis.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:06.370
It's going to get closer
and closer to the y-axis.

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:09.840
But it's never going
to be quite touch it.
