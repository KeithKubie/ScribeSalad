COLLEEN SHOGAN: Good afternoon and
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.420
My name is Colleen Shogan and I'm
the Deputy Director of the National

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.660
and International Outreach
at the Library.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.480
I'm excited to welcome our audience
inside the historic Members Room

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.260
of the Jefferson Building
here on Capitol Hill.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.700
And I'm equally excited to welcome
our virtual audience joining us via

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.040
live stream.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:45.290 position:56%
A video recording of this event will
be made available on our website.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.830
March is Women's History Month and
we're delighted to celebrate it

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.170
with our new boss, Carla Hayden,
who happens to be the first woman

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.170
and the first African American
to assume this position

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.780
of Librarian of Congress.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:09.490
[applause] A few months
ago, I noticed a lot

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.810
of innovative accomplishments have
begun to happen at the Library.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.180
So, what had changed?

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.770 position:56%
Well, you all know what had changed.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.680
One woman and her leadership
can make a world of difference

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.800
and today's panel is
living proof of that.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.350
Before we start, I would
like to thank the Library

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.500
of Congress' Office
of EEO and Diversity

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.460
for making this program
possible today.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.530
Now, I'd like to briefly introduce
our participants before turning it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.400
over to Dr. Hayden
for our discussion.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.020
Marin Alsop is the
12th musical director

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.510
for the Baltimore Symphony
Orchestra.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.880
She is the first woman to head
a major American orchestra

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.440 position:56%
and the only conductor to receive
the prestigious McArthur Fellowship.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.920
In 2010, she was inducted into
the Classical Music Hall of Fame.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.870
Previously, she was the
first principal conductor

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:07.160
and then the musical director of
the Colorado Symphony Orchestra.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.190
In addition to her numerous awards,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.300
she has lead the Baltimore
Symphony Orchestra

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.580
in key outreach initiatives,

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.250
resulting in greater youth
musical awareness and appreciation.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.060
A student of Leonard Bernstein,
Alsop grew up in New York City

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.270
and is a graduate of Yale
University and Julliard.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.070
Deborah Rutter is the
third President

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.450
of the John F. Kennedy Center
for the Performing Arts.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.250
She is the first woman
to lead the center.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.130
In her capacity as
President, she is the Artistic

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.090
and Administrative Director
of the Kennedy Center,

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.240
managing all aspects
of the institution.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.640
Prior to her current position,
Ms. Rutter served as President

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.360
of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.950
and Executive Director
of the Seattle Symphony.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.300
Yo Yo Ma credits her for making the
Chicago Orchestra more accessible

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.050
to a wider audience through
innovative educational programs

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.850
and community engagement,

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
a model she is currently
replicating at the Kennedy Center.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.020
A native of Pennsylvania and Los
Angeles, Rutter is a graduate

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.980
of Stanford University
and holds an MBA from USC.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.790
Molly Smith has served
as the Artistic Director

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.530
of the Arena Stage since 1998.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.640
She has lead the invention of
the Arena Stage with a vision

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.140
of creating a national
center for American artists.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.320
In 2010, the Washingtonian
famously referred to her

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.000
as the unsinkable Molly Smith.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.610
[laughter] During her leadership,
Arena has workshopped more

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.070
than 100 productions,
produced 39 world premieres,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.460
and developed 9 projects
that have headed to Broadway.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.200
Before coming to Washington, Ms.
Smith was the Artistic Director

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.360
of the Perseverance
Theater in Juneau, Alaska.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.060
She has served as the literary
advisor to the Sundance Theater Lab

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.580
and formed the Arena
Stage Writers Council,

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.940
whose members are leading
American playwrights.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.430 position:56%
Ms. Smith is a graduate of Catholic
University and has a Master's Degree

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.510 position:56%
in Theater from American University.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:12.840 position:56%
Our moderator today is Carla Hayden,
the 14th Librarian of Congress.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.540
Please join me in welcoming
these distinguished women

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.840
to the Library of Congress.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:34.330 position:56%
[applause] CARLA HAYDEN: I must tell
you that I've been the Librarian

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.090
of Congress for 6 months and
I've had many many wonderful

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:45.050
opportunities to interact with many
people, the collections and things,

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.490
but I have to tell you, this
is super special for me.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:56.000
Because I have admired
Marin for a long time.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.230
I've gotten to be very
jealous of Deborah with that

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.270
and that unsinkable Molly.

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.280
Wow. So, it's wonderful
to be with you

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:16.180
and to have what I hope will be
an honest and engaging discussion

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.600
about being women in
the arts in particular

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:24.590
but also in leadership positions.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.490
When I was introduced as
the first African American,

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.440
which is of course very significant
in many ways for me personally,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.960
but being a woman in a
feminized profession,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.470 position:56%
where 85% of the workforce is female

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:48.120
and the top leadership
does not reflect that fact,

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.780
is really significant
for my profession

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.540
and has been talked about.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.050
So, in my journey,
I had the beginning,

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.720
not even knowing I was
going to be the Librarian -

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.290
being an accidental
librarian, I call it.

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:07.510
And I wondered how your journey
started in terms of the arts

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.580
and then how did you make that
shift from being in the arts

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.050
to arts management and leadership.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.300
When did that switch happen?

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.990
Molly? MOLLY SMITH: Sure, sure.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:24.730
Well, I was interested
in arts and theater

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:29.720
from when I was a little girl
and went to Catholic school

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.280
and thought I was going to
go into a pre-law degree.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.630
And in the middle of traveling
through Europe at the age of 19

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.680
with a backpack on, I decided
I was going to chuck all that,

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.190
follow my heart and start
a theater in Alaska, ok?

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:46.960
How crazy.

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.600
Everybody thought I was crazy.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:52.630
So, in a sense, I moved from
artist to administrator right away,

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.440
studied for the next 7
years to make that happen

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.800
and then drug 50 USC
students to Alaska

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.780
to start the Perseverance Theater.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.600
That's still alive and kicking now.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:09.130
It's 38 years old and then about 19
years ago, I came to Arena Stage.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:15.210 position:56%
So, I think I'm an artist whose
always wanted a home and often times

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.270
when you want a home, it also means

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:20.970
that you combine the
artistry with management.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:24.150
CARLA HAYDEN: Unsinkable.

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.220
DEBORAH RUTTER: Great
name - Perseverance.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.990
CARLA HAYDEN: And Deborah, you
had an interesting way of getting

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.580
into management from art.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.960
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, actually
I think mine is very parallel.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.840
As a young person, I was
the beneficiary of a time

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.760
when there was music
and art in schools.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.920
So, in my public school,
I had the opportunity

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.900
to become a violinist, literally.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:52.120
My third grade teacher said,
"which instrument will you play?"

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.790
Not, "would you like to
play, but will you play?"

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.290
Played in orchestras
and followed my heart.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.930
Thought I was going to go
off and get some other job,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:05.360
not really knowing that there was
such a thing until I was in college

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:11.620
and was introduced through
family friends to the field.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.350
And had my first Summer job,

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:16.620
my first real summer job,
I had other summer jobs.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.430
My first real Summer job
was at the Hollywood bowl

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:21.240
for the Los Angeles Philharmonic

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.600
and I decided there was this
whole world of arts management.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.300
So, I took a pretty traditional
course in this way, but I would say

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:34.170
that every decision I made in
my life was following my heart

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:38.170
which needed to follow music
and I was never going to be able

00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:42.820
to spend enough time in a practice
room to be doing what she does.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.340
So, I get to support.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.060
Basically what I do is to
support what these two people do.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:49.290
CARLA HAYDEN: And that's great.

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:50.590
And violin?

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.340
MARIN ALSOP: I was a violinist
of course, but when I saw...

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.170
My dad took me to a young
people's concert when I was 9.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:03.210
And I was getting in a lot of
trouble playing violin and trying

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:05.340
to lead the orchestra from
the back of the violins

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:07.660
at Julliard, pre college.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:10.060
So, then, this guy
came out to conduct

00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:12.180
who was jumping around
like a lunatic.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.780
And I turned to my dad and
said, "I could be the conductor

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.400
because nobody's yelling at him."

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.340
I was 9 and that was
Leonard Bernstein

00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:23.970
and eventually he became
my teacher and mentor.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:26.850
And he was my hero
for my entire life.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.700
But, I think as a conductor
and especially as a woman,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:33.180
in a field where there
were very few women,

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.560
you have to be an entrepreneur

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.660
because you don't have an
instrument as a conductor.

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:40.880
Unless you can coerce 20
or 30 people are coming

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.770 position:56%
over every day to practice with you.

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:45.070
You don't have an instrument.

00:09:45.070 --> 00:09:49.130
So, it's all about what you can put
together and the way I learned how

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:51.990
to conduct was by getting
all of my friends together

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.290
and creating an orchestra.

00:09:53.290 --> 00:09:59.100 position:56%
So, I ran my own first orchestra and
learned hands on how to do marketing

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.900
and build a board and all
those kinds of great things.

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:04.470
So, now I'm just a really
annoying music director

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:06.460
because I know a little
bit too much.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.500
I don't know enough
about management,

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.570
but I know more than I should.

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.620
[laughter] You're just
lucky you don't have me.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:22.520
CARLA HAYDEN: Are there special
challenges for women in the arts

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.560
in terms of pay equity,
discrimination?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.010
Have you experienced that?

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:31.000
MARIN ALSOP: You know that's
such a, from my perspective,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.240
that's a question I'm asked
often, especially by journalists

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.420
and I think it's, I
don't know the arts are

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.660
such a difficult field anyway.

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.850
It's really hard to
ascertain which aspect

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:48.480
of what you're doing is causing
some kind of discrimination

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:53.310
because there are so many ways
that you can run into obstacles.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:58.120
And I really think that,
I think that for me,

00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:05.900
I think part of my success is never
attributing any of my difficulties

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.370
or rejections to being a woman.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:13.940
I think that, instead, I always
thought, "ok, I have to be better.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.840
Let me try to, how can I get
something positive out of this

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.880
and learn from it and apply
it to what I'm doing?"

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.100
So, that's how I've reacted to it.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.510
I don't know if you've
had similar experiences.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:29.870 position:56%
DEBORAH RUTTER: What I would imagine
for you and is true certainly

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.860
in my experience is that
there are preconceptions

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.450
about what people believe
should happen.

00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:39.400
You know, what will a
woman wear on a podium?

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:43.190
What do women wear if they're
a soloist playing the violin

00:11:43.190 --> 00:11:46.540 position:56%
or the piano or anything, the flute?

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.840
Whatever it is.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.010
So, there are just
gender expectations

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:55.140
and those expectations are one
that we all have, male and female.

00:11:55.140 --> 00:11:56.440
MARIN ALSOP: Yes, that's true.

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.710 position:56%
DEBORAH RUTTER: And that we all sort
of have to deal with and understand.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.890
And those are the kinds
of expectations

00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:04.840
that are difficult to overcome.

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.250
Because if you don't fall
in line, then there's going

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:10.680
to be a discussion, "well,
she didn't fall in line."

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:17.820
So, how many men have to
buy gowns to do their work?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:19.120
I have to buy them.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.850
People ask me, "what are
you wearing tonight?"

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.890
When's the last time
somebody asked a man,

00:12:22.890 --> 00:12:24.220
what he was wearing to an event?

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.410
CARLA HAYDEN: Especially
to a black tie event.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:27.880
DEBORAH RUTTER: Exactly.

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:32.470
So, I think Marin's
comment is right.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:36.420
The arts is a different
kind of business.

00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:42.340 position:56%
And so the interactions that we have
with our bosses, the interactions

00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.780
that we have with our patrons,

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:47.680
with our potential patrons are
all a little bit different.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:52.240
But there's always this issue
of how do people treat women

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.350
and men what the expectations
are I think that's the part

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:57.390
that you are constantly
working to overcome.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:13:01.500
MOLLY SMITH: There are
pretty shocking statistics

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.560
in theater as far as men and women.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.790
Of the major theaters
in the United States

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:12.030
and there are 1800 theaters
now that really started

00:13:12.030 --> 00:13:15.500
by three intrepid women which
really included Zelda Fitch Handler

00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:18.860
of the Arena Stage 70 years ago.

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.740
And there are large theaters
and of the large theaters

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.950
and of the large theaters, only
twenty percent are run by women.

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:34.510
In terms of plays that are
produced by these 1800 theaters,

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:37.820
only 22% are written by women.

00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.290
So, let that penny drop.

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:42.080
Start to look at that.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.120
When you realize that that's
happening at the leadership level,

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.500
that means it's happening

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.640
because boards are leaning
more into male candidates.

00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:58.380 position:56%
It means that headhunters perhaps
have more males who are headhunters.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:03.350
It means that we have to do
much more in terms of mentorship

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:07.370
of young women who are
coming up and support them.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.490
In terms of changing the
paradigm, it's a paradigm shift.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:14.030
I mean, I would agree with
what everybody else has said,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.210
but then I think there's the
other piece that just has to do

00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:22.210
with statistical difficulties
of what women face

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:24.110
in terms of leadership positions.

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.420
It is that you have to be better.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:29.550 position:56%
Wasn't it Flo Kennedy that said,
"Fortunately, that's not difficult"?

00:14:29.550 --> 00:14:36.000
[laughter] That was a very
funny line, but it's complicated

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.010
and I think the idea of
mentorship is so powerful.

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.010
Because it is the step in.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:43.910
It is the door opening.

00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:48.050 position:56%
Even for me, more than education, it
takes you in a whole other direction

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.170
because mentorship is a one

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:53.690
on one relationship
that shows you the path.

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.550
And I think without mentors for me
like Joy Zimmerman and Paula Vogel,

00:14:58.550 --> 00:15:02.220
who's a brilliant playwright, I
don't know if I would be here.

00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.260
MARIN ALSOP: The statistics in
classical music are even more dire.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:11.800
I think of our programming,
is it 5% by women composers?

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.150
It's really and I'm
sure for conductors,

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:17.500
it ranges around there as well.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.180
But, I would just jump in
to say that I agree so much

00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:24.590 position:56%
about this concept about mentorship.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.740
But also, I had a recent, if
I can tell a little anecdote.

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.770
I was conducting in Lucerne
at the festival this summer.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:36.870
It's just I'm giving a master
class for young women conductors

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:40.790
and an older woman in her 80s came
and talked to me and someone said,

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:42.090
"Oh, do you know who she is?"

00:15:42.090 --> 00:15:44.870
I said, "no, but she seems to
know a lot about conducting."

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:48.810
Well, her name is Sylvia Kaduf
and I had never heard her name

00:15:48.810 --> 00:15:54.310 position:56%
and so I found out from someone else
that she was Bernstein's assistant

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:57.170
in 1966 in the New
York Philharmonic.

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:00.100
She was the first woman to win
the Metropolis competition,

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.860
also the first woman to
conduct the Berlin Philharmonic.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:04.160
And I had never heard of her.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.460
I had never heard of her.

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:09.890
So, I went back to Lucerne two
weeks ago with a film crew I hired

00:16:09.890 --> 00:16:14.030
from Berlin and I'm
making a film about her.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:18.340
And it was awesome to find
her story, but also this idea

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.150
of how can we change the landscape?

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.810
If we don't do it- the three of
us here, nobody's going to do it.

00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:26.780
So, for me that meant,
for conducting,

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:31.490
and tell me if I talk too
much, I might be there already.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.650
[laughter] But, for
conducting, you know for women,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.070
you get one opportunity to
conduct and you have to remember

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.800
that you haven't practiced with
your instrument before and all

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.440
of the information that you're
trying to process and adapt to

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.160
and adjust to is so overwhelming
and you have only one chance,

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.150
so you can't make a mistake.

00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:54.740
And, you have to be able
to make mistakes in order

00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.650
to really achieve greatness,
in my opinion.

00:16:57.650 --> 00:17:00.820
So, in 2002, I started a fellowship

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.080
for women conductors,
young women conductors.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:05.730
And I bring them around to
orchestras I'm conducting

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:07.530
and they just do the opening piece.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:10.420
So, it's not the pressure
of the whole concert on them

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.390 position:56%
and get some feedback from musicians

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.050
and from managers and
things like that.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:19.370
I have to say that of the 11
winners of the fellowship,

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.740
4 or now American music
directors, 5 are assistants

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:25.780
with major orchestras, and 2
started their own orchestras.

00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:29.090
So, I feel that you know,
at least in a small way,

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:32.050
maybe by creating opportunities,
but this is to your point,

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:36.140
that society isn't accustomed to
seeing women in these positions,

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:38.490
so we have to try to change that.

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:39.800
Even for me too.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.930
Seeing women in certain
roles, it's a little jarring.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:45.790
CARLA HAYDEN: It's
jarring to normalize it,

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.400
to say that it's not
anything unusual.

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.050
MARIN ALSOP: And we're predisposed
to being receptive to that.

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.410
CARLA HAYDEN: Right.

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:55.620
Deborah, are you doing
some things in terms

00:17:55.620 --> 00:18:00.200
of encouraging more diversity?

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.360
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, a
couple of different things.

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.400
I wanted to say which is what I
know about the work that they do is

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:11.370
that the level of individual
self-promotion has

00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:12.850
to be pretty high.

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:17.160
And we who are the ones making
the choices along the way,

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.780
have to be really open to it.

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:21.470
And it's really important
for us to understand

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:25.400
that sometimes those behaviors
of self-promotion amongst,

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.460
and this goes again
to what is expected,

00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:35.400
understood in different ways, is
that a woman being self-promoting,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.470
could be conceived as aggressive.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:41.380
Whereas a man doing that is
just doing his job, right?

00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:47.210
So, there's always this sort of
balance of perception and there has

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:49.920
to be the mentorship
and the open invitation.

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:56.210 position:56%
Because as I think about it, it's
really hard sometimes to sort of cut

00:18:56.210 --> 00:19:00.750
through to see the true gem that is
there without the self-promotion.

00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:04.480 position:56%
So, it's one of those things that we
have to add to our tool kit in a way

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.820
that feels comfortable for us,

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.350
but that for others
can receive it as well.

00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:13.890
For us at the center and as
a manager, and administrator,

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:15.790
in fact women are not the problem.

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:18.930
Sometimes we need to find more men
to sit around the table with us.

00:19:18.930 --> 00:19:23.000
Because we are a mission driven
institutions, we are magnets

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.840
for women who care about what
they're doing and women like me,

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.980
who said, "well I love to sing
or I love to play the cello,

00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.020
but I wasn't good enough,
so I can go and work there."

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:38.190 position:56%
And at the center, we have countless
dancers and actors and people

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:40.780
who are former somethings
who come and work.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:46.700 position:56%
So, internal for us, is not so much
the issue of gender, but it's really

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:51.270
about the issue of
diversity background.

00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:54.920
And this is something that
is very important to me

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.550
and that we're working to
really put a focus on this.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:04.710
And our HR team has a whole new
diversity and inclusion plan.

00:20:04.710 --> 00:20:08.140
Most importantly, is that we're
developing something beyond the

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.380
mentorship which is a
true fellowship program.

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:11.780
And that fellowship is

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.790
about identifying future
arts administrators

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:19.940
with diverse backgrounds, diverse
interests, and bringing them

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.580
into the center and really
doing the same kind of thing

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:28.120
that you have done and
sort of helping give

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.120
that extra boost, that extra lift.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.860
MARIN ALSOP: But on the
administrative side.

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.330
DEBORAH RUTTER: On
the administrative,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:36.860
because if you don't have,
it works in both ways.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.790
You know, if you don't
have the leadership,

00:20:38.790 --> 00:20:41.630
they don't have the vision,
the perspective to offer.

00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:47.140 position:56%
And so, this is about having a
table of people around which you put

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:50.060
so many different voices and making
sure all of the voices are heard.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.320
It's a big priority for us.

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:53.770
CARLA HAYDEN: That's great.

00:20:53.770 --> 00:20:56.310
MOLLY SMITH: We have a
fellows and internship program

00:20:56.310 --> 00:21:00.420
at Arena Stage called the Alan
Lee Hughes Fellowship program

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:05.740
that has been going now for 25
years and it is for young people

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.640
from diverse backgrounds.

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:10.230 position:56%
Over 700 people have been through it

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.160
and because we've just hit the
25th year, we went back to find

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:15.920
out how many people are
still working in the arts.

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:21.620
92%. So, this is again, a one
on one internship program.

00:21:21.620 --> 00:21:26.170
It's been going for a long time in
every area like theater management,

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:29.860
artistic directing, playwriting,

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:33.190
just about every area,
lighting designer.

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.110
And our field now is
rife with young people

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.170
that have come out of this program.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.760
Also make sure because I
believe every act that we make

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.930
in the arts is a political act.

00:21:45.930 --> 00:21:48.620
Probably every act we make in
our lives is a political act

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:51.010
because it's about choices, right?

00:21:51.010 --> 00:21:57.020
And so this year, seven out of
our ten plays are written by women

00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:02.460
or men of color because I combine
that in terms of what I see as far

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:09.430
as diversity and there are 8 plays
directed by women or men of color.

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:14.720 position:56%
And I try and balance it on a yearly
basis because I think who you put

00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.570
on stage, those are the
voices that the audiences hear

00:22:18.570 --> 00:22:22.370
and that's the way audiences
start to change their perspective

00:22:22.370 --> 00:22:24.850
of who is a leader and
who isn't a leader.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:29.190 position:56%
So, we just keep trying to right the
balance as far as the programming

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.470
and the ideas we put on stage.

00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:33.540
MARIN ALSOP: From my
perspective of course,

00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.030
when I came to the Baltimore
Symphony and looking at the make-up

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:42.290
of the orchestra on stage, you
know the Baltimore Symphony has

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:48.010
and still has one African American
member and how to change that,

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:52.120
how to change that make-up,

00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:58.380
I mean it's a long ranging
vision that one has to take.

00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:02.210
You have to take, ok in my
lifetime it may not happen,

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:07.170
but the reality is that the
kids aren't getting access

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:11.300 position:56%
to instruments young enough in order
to gain, first of all, the interest

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.580
and the skill to audition for
an orchestra at this level.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:20.420
So, that's when I approached
my musicians and said, "listen,

00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.190
why don't we mentor one
kid in the neighborhood."

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:29.350
That didn't go so well, but
the idea, the idea developed

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:34.800
into a program where we started
with 30 kindergarten kids in 2008

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:38.060
and today we have almost
1500 kids playing instruments

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.920
and there are 17 are now at the
high school for performing arts,

00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.140
they've been accepted because
they are now getting old enough

00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:46.460
to get to high school age.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.970
But, you know, how long it will
take for a program like Orch Kids

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:52.270
and for some other
programs that have come

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:57.850
up to impact our major orchestras
and our major stages, who knows?

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.700
But if we don't start, you
know that's the point, right?

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:05.010
And also it affects our audiences.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:08.830
Now all of these kids and
their parents are big classical

00:24:08.830 --> 00:24:10.130
music fans.

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:12.250
CARLA HAYDEN: Because they
attend the performances

00:24:12.250 --> 00:24:13.550
because of their children.

00:24:13.550 --> 00:24:16.000
So, that gets to what
Deborah you mentioned,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.940
there are very few arts
programs now in schools.

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.310
So, isn't that a big
challenge in terms of looking

00:24:24.310 --> 00:24:25.790
at your future audiences?

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.090
Your future?

00:24:27.090 --> 00:24:29.470
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well I could talk

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:31.480
for the next three
hours on this topic.

00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.780 position:56%
CARLA HAYDEN: We're going to open it

00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.380
up for question and
answer in a minute.

00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:38.020
DEBORAH RUTTER: You know, I
most recently lived in Chicago

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.190
and what was really interesting was
the northern suburbs had fantastic

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:46.750
music programs because
the school districts

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.770
in that area were wealthy enough
and had leadership and input

00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:55.510
from family enough that they
had really great programs.

00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:58.810
It was the schools in the
city and on the Southside

00:24:58.810 --> 00:25:01.190
that were suffering
the most from this.

00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:08.040
And the tragedy of this is that the
programs around any kind of art,

00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.560
whether its dance or theater or
music are what keep kids in school,

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:19.300
keep them focused, get them really
engaged with being successful.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.550
And so this is not so much a
strategy for building audiences

00:25:23.550 --> 00:25:26.300
for our theaters of
the future at all.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:29.330
I am here because of
my third grade teacher.

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.310
Yes, my family cared
about it and still do,

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:37.040
but my teachers were the most
important people in my life

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.180
who brought me to this place.

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:44.860
And there's increasing scientific
knowledge that supports the idea

00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.090
that being engaged with the arts
helps with brain development

00:25:49.090 --> 00:25:51.550
which then of course,
leads to school success.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:56.030
So, this really is a
campaign that is so much not

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.470
about arts organizations,
but people who care

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.250
about what it can do
for young people.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:06.690
And that's my not so secret goal
is to have every child be able

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:09.000
to have access to arts education.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.510
So Orch Kids is the
perfect example of this.

00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:12.200
MARIN ALSOP: But, we see the kids.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:19.590 position:56%
We don't have the kind of funding to
study it in depth, but anecdotally,

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:24.050
I see the kids growing, I see
them developing, I see them skills

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:28.600
that they can apply to any
discipline they select.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.080
And the goal isn't to make them
all classical musicians although I

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.380
wouldn't mind that of course.

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.320
But, the goal really is
in 20 years when I go

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:37.760
to the doctor and she
says, "oh yeah.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.060
I remember you.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.360
I was an Orch Kid."

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.160
Or the mayor or the
leaders of our community

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.200
because the important skills you
develop are the ones you need

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.500
in every field.

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.810
CARLA HAYDEN: It's called
a discipline for a reason.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.410
DEBORAH RUTTER: It's
about creativity,

00:26:53.410 --> 00:26:55.980
it's about collaboration,
innovation.

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:58.440
These are all skills
for future workforce.

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.790
MARIN ALSOP: And it's how they
all feel about themselves also.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.900
I remember in math, you're either
right or wrong - it's a 50/50.

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:14.120
But, if you play a violin, you're
always right, let me tell you.

00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:15.540
[laughter] In my house maybe.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:20.470
DEBORAH RUTTER: There's a
great example in Chicago today,

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:25.230
the Kenwood Academy which has
a really beautiful jazz program

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:27.680
that has been built
and nurtured by someone

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.730
who really loved the school
and the program there.

00:27:30.730 --> 00:27:34.820
And with just a little bit of
an extra boost and attention,

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.390
the school and the children are

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:40.170
so much more successful
as a result of this.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:43.740
We did a project with them
in Chicago and Jason Moran,

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.310 position:56%
our artistic director for Jazz,
loved it so much that he reprised it

00:27:48.310 --> 00:27:52.710 position:56%
and reprised it and changed it based
on his relationship with these kids

00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:56.280
and brought it 3 years later,
so it was the next generation

00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.510
of high school jazz band, to
Washington to perform with him.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:03.290
And what this does for these
children on the Southside

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.170
of Chicago is so powerful.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:09.100
CARLA HAYDEN: I know about Kenwood
on the Southside of Chicago.

00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:13.490
And the theater part and
getting them involved.

00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:18.690
MOLLY SMITH: My biggest fear
of losing the arts in school is

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:20.790
that we lose innovation
in every field.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:27.360
That's our number one power, I
think, as like our American energy,

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.660
that kind of entrepreneurship.

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:31.630
Because what the arts teach you,

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:35.600
has to do with teamwork,
ideas, imagination.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:39.140
You know, the greatest freedom
we have is our imagination.

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:43.770
And I don't think we are taught it
in the same way in the sciences,

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:47.570
so that's why I keep arguing
for not STEM but STEAM.

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:51.290
Let's put the power in it as well.

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:56.190
So, we reach about 20,000 young
people at Arena Stage every year.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.550 position:56%
But, the one program I'd like to
talk about it is the "Voices of Now"

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:07.270
which is ten different groups of
young people who developed stories

00:29:07.270 --> 00:29:10.130
from their lives over a
9 month period of time

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:13.310
and then they are all produced
at Arena Stage and end up touring

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:15.010
in different places as well.

00:29:15.010 --> 00:29:18.740
Now, anecdotally, we have a lot
of information about what happens

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:21.850
to the young people after this
program, how many of them go

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:25.080
on to college, how many of
them go on to graduate school,

00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.450
how many of them go
on to great careers.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:30.970
Again, it's fantastic.

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:36.060
That one on one relationship
changes a young person's life

00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:38.880
and so fighting for
programming in the schools,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.430
I think is very important
because what's happened,

00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:45.040
basically around the
country is theaters

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.920
and arts organizations
have taken up that banner

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.260
and we're doing the arts programs
within our own organization.

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:55.360
CARLA HAYDEN: What
about teacher education?

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:01.700
Helping teachers who might not have
a formal arts program do something?

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.520
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, this is
a big issue because of course,

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.120
so much needs to be done
in the primary classroom

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.700
and those teachers are not experts.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.820
So, teaching artists are
really critically important

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:16.540
and teaching artists are, come
in by contract to a school

00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.030
and they stand side by side with a
classroom teacher to help augment

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:22.850
that training that happens.

00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:25.840
We, at the center have a pretty
significant one that we do

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.220
in various parts of the
country and we understand

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:31.850
that teacher training
is really vital.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:34.780
We work with teaching
artists as well.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.190
A program that we just brought

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.660
on last fall is called,
"Turnaround Arts."

00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:42.070
It started out at the President's
Committee for arts and humanities

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:46.610
and Michelle Obama was sort of
the champion for this program.

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:51.700
And it was about using the arts to
help turn a low performing school

00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.580
into a higher performing school.

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.620
So, it was beyond teaching
arts education.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:30:59.950
It was integrating art
into the daily lives.

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.830
So, you learn multiplication
tables by singing

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:07.520
or you would learn history
by creating a play or acting.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:13.870
And so we're in about 60, I
think it's 60, I keep inflating

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:17.400
and I don't want to over inflate
yet, but we're in a whole lot

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:20.620
of low performing schools
across the country.

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:24.250
I've only had it in the program
for about 6 months now, so.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.530
But, it's a very exciting
program because we work

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:30.280
by providing resources to
the school, teaching artists

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.900
into the school, training for the
school, the school as a whole,

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:38.980
not just certain, in
the classroom teachers.

00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:43.690 position:56%
And then we pair them with celebrity
artists who actually make a point

00:31:43.690 --> 00:31:47.260
of going to the school multiple
times in a year to draw attention

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.740
to the school and build
morale for it.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.040
Bit, it's fascinating because
it's a different approach that we

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.770
as arts administrators have had

00:31:54.770 --> 00:32:00.890
because when arts programming
started getting cut 40 years ago

00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:04.630
or more, even longer than that.

00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:09.710
We as arts institutions first
got angry and frustrated

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.830
and kept saying, "well, it's
the school's responsibility,

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.630 position:56%
it's the government's responsibility
and we didn't at that time go

00:32:15.630 --> 00:32:17.000
in and say, "lets partner."

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:20.350
Now we have to partner because
otherwise it won't exist at all.

00:32:20.350 --> 00:32:24.690
So, sometimes our organizations
are the only ones providing that.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:29.560
But, we are trying with Turnaround
Arts, to demonstrate that the use

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:32.170
of the arts can actually
help improve a school.

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:36.440
And through that case and getting
the research to support it,

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.360
then we might be able
to have a larger impact.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.780
CARLA HAYDEN: Haven't
you been able to attract,

00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:44.640
I know withy Orch Kids,
philanthropy?

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:46.280
Arts philanthropy has increased.

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.000
MARIN ALSOP: Yeah, of course.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.030
I think that.

00:32:51.030 --> 00:32:54.580
Well, there are a few
things I'd love to say.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.810
Something that is on my mind at
least at the moment is that I hope

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:03.180
that the small amount of
government support for the arts

00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:07.640
that we now currently
have, that everyone speaks

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.030
out to preserve the National
Endowment for the Arts.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:16.940
It's a very very small
token support of the arts,

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:23.480
but I think it's very important
that we insist that our leadership

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:28.600
in the United States of
America, at least advocates

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:31.790
for the arts in some small measure.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.590
I mean, I work as musical
director also in Brazil

00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:41.700 position:56%
at the Sao Paolo Symphony and I have
to say for Brazil where everything's

00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:43.760
in chaos constantly there.

00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:50.150
Yet, the leadership of the country
believes that art is a vehicle

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:55.860
to promote tolerance and
peace among people and so even

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:59.860
when things are cut, the
arts are cut proportionally,

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.600
not disproportionally.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:08.080
And that gives me pause to think
that here in South America,

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.520
there in South America,
they could have this kind

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.630 position:56%
of visionary leadership, whereas
here in the United States where it's

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:19.380
so integral to who we are,
I believe as Americans,

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:26.170
it's all about the individual, the
creative power of entrepreneurship

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:29.280
and that's what we're all
about, sort of fundamentally and

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:31.030
yet we're not supporting that.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:32.800
It's not about the arts.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.230
You know, we make it sort
of a siloed experience.

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:42.360 position:56%
It's about creating people who are
well balanced and who have a vision.

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.920
I can think outside the box.

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:46.700
Maybe that's the biggest
thing the arts give you.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.150
You know, whether you ever
go into the arts or not.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:53.710
And of course it's always a
struggle in the United States

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:57.620
because we have to, we
have to build support-

00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.010
philanthropic support
on every level.

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:03.710
It's not just that you have a good
idea, but then you have to fund it

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.540
and then you have to measure it.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.490
That's the part I struggle with.

00:35:08.490 --> 00:35:09.890
Everything has to be measured here.

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:11.740
CARLA HAYDEN: Yes,
what are the results?

00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.360
MARIN ALSOP: Can we have the data?

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.720
CARLA HYDEN: For the
full human being.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.020
How about that?

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.320
MARIN ALSOP: Yeah really.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.620
Maybe just shake the kid's hand.

00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.490
DEBORAH RUTTER: I have stood
side by side with this issue

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:28.240
and the argument about data for a
long time and have come to believe

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:33.540
that sometimes if you can
demonstrate what really happened.

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.470
We certainly count
the number of people

00:35:35.470 --> 00:35:37.020
who have attended performances.

00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:40.390
We are counting the number of
women enrolled etcetera etcetera.

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.470
If we can see what the impact is.

00:35:42.470 --> 00:35:45.940
The issue really is, we are
always living on a shoestring.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:50.470
Because you always want to
put more money into the art,

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.250
you don't really want to put
money into the things around it

00:35:53.250 --> 00:35:54.980
that might support
it in the long term.

00:35:54.980 --> 00:35:59.130
So, this issue of doing research
and evaluation and keeping track

00:35:59.130 --> 00:36:03.820
of it is one that we in our field
have really not done a great job

00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.450
and as I've come to
the Kennedy Center,

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.580
we do more of for exactly
the reasons

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:11.700
that we've been talking about.

00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.030
MARIN ALSOP: Well,
you have that mandate.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:16.710
Do you find though, I think
we've done a very poor job also

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:23.220
of educating the public as to
the financial benefit of arts.

00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.110
You know, for every
dollar spent in the arts,

00:36:26.110 --> 00:36:32.380
it exponentially reaps results that
are exponential to the investment

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.460
and we haven't done a good
job of publicizing that

00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:37.950
and getting the message out
to the public I don't think.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:39.250
CARLA HAYDEN: That seems

00:36:39.250 --> 00:36:41.210
like it would be very
strong with the public.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.250
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, just earlier
this week, Darren at the Americans

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:48.350
for the Arts program, Bob
Lynch spoke about the fact

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:54.140
that 145 million dollars of the
NEA is worth some huge magnitude

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.040
like 800 billion dollars.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:03.100
Not million, but billion dollars of
economic impact and so we're not,

00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.890
this is not a trivial thing,
what we're standing up for.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:11.890
If you can track what happens
to a young person who's involved

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:15.290
with the arts and where
they go, whether

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:18.610
and how the arts have influenced
them, I think that can be something

00:37:18.610 --> 00:37:21.040
that is really important
for us to be looking at.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:23.150
I think the Americans for the
Arts are doing more of it,

00:37:23.150 --> 00:37:27.840
but we need to do it more
as individual institutions.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.340
MOLLY SMITH: When Arena
made the decision to stay

00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:38.630
in Southwest Washington and
rebuild, that whole program

00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:43.510
and the new Arena Stage really
became a catalyst for building

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:47.580 position:56%
in Southwest Washington, which has
been seen as the forgotten quadrant.

00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.670
There are now 36 different
developments

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:51.970
that are happening there.

00:37:51.970 --> 00:37:53.390
If you drive down in Southwest,

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:55.670
you'll probably see
15 cranes in the air.

00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:58.280
Now, would that have
happened without Arena?

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.700
Probably in about 15 or 20 years.

00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:02.340
Did it get pushed by Arena?

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:07.700
Yes. And we see that happening in
communities all over Washington DC

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:10.250
and indeed all over the country.

00:38:10.250 --> 00:38:14.720
The arts are real drivers
of economic expansion.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.560 position:56%
My fear about the loss of the NEA,
the loss of the NEH, the loss of all

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:25.290
of our cultural programs, is
what is really going to happen

00:38:25.290 --> 00:38:28.640
in smaller rural areas
as well as in cities.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.000
Because for smaller rural areas,
that often is the only money

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.770
that they have to have
the school program

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:37.710
which is teaching young
people how to do puppetry

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:42.130
or teaching young people
how to make plays.

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:43.450
That's it.

00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:44.750
That's it.

00:38:44.750 --> 00:38:48.280
You know, you go out to some place
like Kotzebue in Alaska and is

00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.240
that whole program going to be cut?

00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.200
So, that really changes
the equation.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:59.180 position:56%
It's a narrowing of vision about the
beauty of who we are as Americans.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:02.410
And that's what I think the attack
is and that's why I think it's

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:05.360
so important for all of us
to get out pen and paper

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:08.130
and write our legislators
and let people know

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.920
because we know pressure works.

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:17.710
It works. [applause] CARLA
HAYDEN: I Just got my time sign

00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:23.760
that we're going to open it
up for a little Q and A. But,

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:27.630
I just wanted to do a little
inside scoop thing here.

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:28.940
You can break some news.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:34.320
Do you have anything that you can
share with us that's coming up?

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:36.370
This is YouTube, Facebook...

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.840
MOLLY SMITH: This is what
we don't want anybody else

00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.500
to know accept for the room, right?

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.880
CARLA HAYDEN: Of course.

00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.830
Some upcoming projects
that might be interesting.

00:39:44.830 --> 00:39:47.160
You mentioned Lorraine
Hansberry is coming.

00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.460
MOLLY SMITH: Yeah.

00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.410
Raisin in the Sun is
coming to Arena Stage.

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:52.320
But, I wanted to mention

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.590
"Sovereignty" that's
coming to Arena next year.

00:39:54.590 --> 00:39:57.810
This is part of our
"Power Plays" initiative.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:40:01.880
We have 25 new plays and musicals
that are being commissioned

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:05.280
by Arena Stage for
each decade beginning

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.310
in 1776 to the present decade.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:11.520 position:56%
We've already commissioned 9 people.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.400
And one of them is Mary Katherine
Nagle, native American lawyer,

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.050
activist lawyer, wonderful
playwright.

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:20.450
Her play is "Sovereignty."

00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:26.150
It takes place both in 1830 with
Andrew Jackson and broken treaties

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.710
and present day broken treaties
between the Cherokee nation

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:33.030
and also the United
States government.

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:36.700
This is a story that hasn't been
told and that's one of the things

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.320
that I love to do in the theater.

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:40.470
CARLA HAYDEN: Wow.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:42.430
Deborah? DEBORAH RUTTER:
Well, you know as we sit

00:40:42.430 --> 00:40:46.380
in this really amazing building
and this beautiful room,

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.620
it seems as though many people
know so much about the history

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.860
of our city, our country, and
the buildings in Washington, DC.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.880
But even I didn't own it
the same way that I do now.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.400
Which is that the Kennedy
Center is the living memorial

00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:02.700
to John F Kennedy.

00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.880
There is no other memorial.

00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:08.190
There is a library and all of
that, but this is the memorial

00:41:08.190 --> 00:41:12.180
to John F Kennedy and you know,
a lot of people didn't really...

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.160
I knew it, but I didn't
know it to live it.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:19.080
And so, as we are on the countdown

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.110
to what would have been his 100th
birthday on May 29 of this year,

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:28.300
we are really thinking about
our identity as it relates

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.450
to both being a performing
arts center

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.120
and the living memorial to JFK.

00:41:32.120 --> 00:41:35.620
And we're having just an
extraordinary season full

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:39.820
of programming that's so easy to
attribute to things that he stood

00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:44.940
for because not only did he and his
wife care so much about the arts

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:49.230
and humanities, but the other
things that we attribute to him-

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.760
courage, freedom, justice.

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.490
There's one...

00:41:53.490 --> 00:41:56.690
Freedom, courage, justice,
and gratitude.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:59.530
And we are building all of
our programming around it

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:04.170
and there's sort of a culminating
week of activities at the Center.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:06.240
All this has been announced,
so it's not new news.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:07.540
CARLA HAYDEN: Oh shoot.

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.840
[laughter] DEBORAH RUTTER:
Other than the fact that,

00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.220
I don't know if everyone
is paying attention

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.520
to it in quite the same way.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:13.990
We're bringing back open house.

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:17.420
We're going to have a day
of celebration for JFK

00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:24.010
and it's really been affirming to
have such a generous, articulate,

00:42:24.010 --> 00:42:28.380
inspiring man to be the
namesake of our space

00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:32.590
and I'm actually looking forward
to an effort that will sort

00:42:32.590 --> 00:42:36.120
of revitalize the memorial
aspect itself,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:41.190
so that the Center will be a must
visit location the way the Library

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:42.490
of Congress...

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:43.790 position:56%
CARLA HAYDEN: We're working on that.

00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:45.970
DEBORAH RUTTER: is a must
visit location for all

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:47.600
who visit our nation's capital.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.900 position:56%
CARLA HAYDEN: We're working on that.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:50.820
I'll explain a little later.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.940
MARIN ALSOP: Well, I don't
have any big secrets.

00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.240
CARLA HAYDEN: Oh Marin.

00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.540
MARIN ALSOP: I know, it's terrible.

00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.350
But, for those of you who don't
know the Baltimore Symphony,

00:42:59.350 --> 00:43:05.170
all I can say is we're sort of the,
we're the poor cousin up the road.

00:43:05.170 --> 00:43:12.280
But, the quality of our
orchestra and the level of passion

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:15.090
and commitment from the musicians
and the Baltimore Symphony,

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.010
I think is really unparalleled
in the United States.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:19.550
I think it's one of the great,

00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:23.810
one of the really great
orchestras of the world.

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:28.000 position:56%
And I'd invite you to come and hear
the orchestra any time and it's nice

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.560
as we're ramping up, also to 2018

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.270
which is the 100 anniversary
of Leonard Bernstein.

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:37.520
And so, it's nice because
we have that connection also

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:42.170
with the Kennedy Center because
Bernstein wrote his mass in honor

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:47.580
of JFK, so there's always that
nice, that nice connection.

00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:53.300
And of course Bernstein inspired so
many people and as I said to start,

00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:55.670 position:56%
was my hero, so we'll be doing a lot

00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:57.440
of programming around
that of course.

00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.990
CARLA HAYDEN: Well, I was saying
and I said I'll mention it later,

00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:04.940
but the Library of Congress
is connecting to all of you.

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:06.980
We have his papers.

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:10.440
We're going to be part
of the celebration.

00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:16.070
Lorraine Hansberry,
Lee Strasburg archives,

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:19.020
so we will be supplementing,
complementing,

00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.750
and will be part of what you do.

00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:22.050
And the Orch Kids are coming.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:23.560
MARIN ALSOP: The Orch Kids are
going to come and play here.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:24.860
CARLA HAYDEN: Right
her in the Great Hall.

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:27.490
So, we are just delighted.

00:44:27.490 --> 00:44:34.490
[applause] So, we'd like
to open it up for questions

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:38.200
or comments and things you have.

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:40.250
Talk about Women's History Month.

00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:43.920
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Well, first
of all thank you very much

00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.570
for your very candid comments.

00:44:46.570 --> 00:44:52.640 position:56%
In the course of the discussion up
there, the term, leadership was used

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.880
at least several dozen times.

00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.520
So, and we have 4 very
distinguished women up there

00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:03.520
who have achieved significant
leadership positions

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.940
in their chosen professional path.

00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:11.690
So, my question is, can
you talk a little more

00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:18.580
about your personal leadership
style and maybe a lesson or two

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:25.000
about leadership that you learned
as you developed into a leader?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.490
CARLA HAYDEN: I'm looking
at you guys first.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:32.110
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, that's
a really good question.

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:36.370
I will start only because these
two have more creative answers

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:37.890
than I do.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:42.760
But, I do think that that's why
there has been an increasing number

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.240
of women in managerial
positions in the arts.

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:49.600
And it's because I am
a consensus builder

00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:52.200
and I work on building teams.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:56.380
I'm not an autocrat who says,
"this is the way it's going to be.

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:57.680
This is what I care about.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.400
This is only what we
are going to do."

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.280
And in fact, whenever I have
a group of colleagues who ask

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:08.770
for that direction, I
push back even harder.

00:46:08.770 --> 00:46:11.820
I push my seat away from
the table and I say, "no,

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:13.860
we are doing this together."

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.770
Building that team who
believe in where we're going

00:46:17.770 --> 00:46:19.620
and how we're going to get there

00:46:19.620 --> 00:46:24.000
and that's the most
rewarding aspect of it.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.160
Now, you go to a different city and
you find a new culture when you go

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:33.280 position:56%
into that organization and
sometimes it takes a while to change

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:36.110
from one style to another.

00:46:36.110 --> 00:46:39.950
And I have never inherited
a job from another woman,

00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:49.270
so I build a different kind of
an atmosphere in the organization

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:54.210
and it's much more fun and you get
so much more done and there are

00:46:54.210 --> 00:46:57.550
so many more creative ideas that
come out of your institution

00:46:57.550 --> 00:47:03.290
when you can lead by building a
team who all have a common vision.

00:47:03.290 --> 00:47:07.920
MOLLY SMITH: And I would
say the most important part

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.420
of leadership is communication.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:17.620 position:56%
Because the worst thing in the world
is to be a leader leading the band

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.480
and there's no one behind you.

00:47:19.480 --> 00:47:26.730
And so it's all about communicating
whatever the particular vision is,

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.390
whatever the particular idea is.

00:47:29.390 --> 00:47:33.830
And also recognizing that
sometimes it take a lot of time

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:38.530
to make whatever that dream
or that vision come true.

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:43.880
When I came to Arena, I
re-focused Arena on American plays,

00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:45.610 position:56%
American ideas and American artists.

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:47.470
It had been much more of
an international company

00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:49.430
and American work before that time.

00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:53.690
It took 8 or 9 years to
do that in a full way.

00:47:53.690 --> 00:47:58.420
And it's really insuring
that everybody who is

00:47:58.420 --> 00:48:02.050
at the theater leads in their
own way because people want

00:48:02.050 --> 00:48:03.600
to lead and people need to lead.

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:06.310
They're their own experts.

00:48:06.310 --> 00:48:09.800
So, giving people the power
to be able to do that,

00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:13.550
I think is incredibly
important in leadership roles.

00:48:13.550 --> 00:48:18.250
MARIN ALSOP: Well, I agree
with everything you're saying.

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:24.410
I think that being a good leader
is being a very good listener.

00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:31.380
I think collaborative leadership,
trying to nurture collaboration.

00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:34.590
But, I think at the end
of the day as a leader,

00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:39.820
you have to accept accountability,
especially in an orchestra.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:42.180
It can't be a democracy.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:47.450
And so, ultimately, even though a
lot of people would like it to be.

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:51.210
I think ultimately,
from my perspective,

00:48:51.210 --> 00:49:00.780
just a personal mantra is "I'd much
rather be respected than liked."

00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:04.670
And often if they respect you long
enough, they end up liking you.

00:49:04.670 --> 00:49:09.260
That can't be one's motivation.

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:12.470
I think sometimes leaders have
to make the hard decisions

00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:16.610
and stand alone for
the good of the art.

00:49:16.610 --> 00:49:19.850
And if you always put your
art first, you can't go wrong.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:22.280
CARLA HAYDEN: That's wonderful.

00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.520
Just on a side note, as
a leader and as a woman,

00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:34.350 position:56%
making sure that there's a safety
net for making mistakes and that you

00:49:34.350 --> 00:49:38.490
as a leader can reveal
that you make mistakes,

00:49:38.490 --> 00:49:41.070
that you do things and it's ok.

00:49:41.070 --> 00:49:43.060
Creating that safety net.

00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.360
Another one.

00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:51.240
And wasn't it funny how
I said, "You guys."?

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:58.100
[laughter] As soon as I said it, I
said, "ok, Women's History Month."

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:05.520
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I applaud each of
you and I hear a lot about children

00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:09.810
and I am a substitute teacher and
an artist and a senior citizen.

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:14.800
And what I want to know is, where
do you see our place in the arts?

00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:19.490
As I hold up my card as
being a senior citizen.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:27.130
CARLA HAYDEN: Well, I just told
Marin about a lady who she knew,

00:50:27.130 --> 00:50:32.640
Netty Taylor, who just
passed away recently at 102

00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.440
and her greatest joy was
bringing young people to the BSO,

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.780
the Baltimore Symphony
Orchestra and being that person,

00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.430
even with the wheel
chair, everything.

00:50:42.430 --> 00:50:47.470 position:56%
Netty Taylor would sit there and
make sure that she was part of that.

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:54.860
MARIN ALSOP: So, don't you think
we could do a lot more with seniors

00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:56.200
and getting them involved?

00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:57.500
Especially...

00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.930
One of my dreams is for
our Orch Kids program is

00:51:00.930 --> 00:51:05.790
to offer our retired musicians
who have this unbelievable wealth

00:51:05.790 --> 00:51:11.740
of knowledge, a post-orchestra
career working with the Orch Kids

00:51:11.740 --> 00:51:15.250
and putting a whole
training program into place.

00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:21.310
I think that when I look at many
of our volunteers, are older people

00:51:21.310 --> 00:51:25.980
who are involved with the kids and
they're so devoted and dedicated.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:32.930
And they also come
with this lifetime

00:51:32.930 --> 00:51:35.250
of experience and knowledge.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:39.960
So, I think we can offer more
because I think it's a resource

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.410
that we're not taking
advantage of as we could.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:45.780
DEBORAH RUTTER: You know,

00:51:45.780 --> 00:51:52.150
if you think about the work
that's often done by corporations,

00:51:52.150 --> 00:51:56.440
sort of searching after
the 18 to 24 year old.

00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:01.680
And I have spent all of my
career sort of scratching my head

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.270
about why are we always talking
about wanting younger audiences?

00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:07.350
Part of the reason we're
looking for younger audiences is

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:11.230
because we're all aging and we're
all aging into being seniors

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:13.400
and we're all aging into
that time in our life

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.970
when we actually have more
time to do other things.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:18.620
We need to make sure that you
have young people coming in.

00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.660
And it's about making the
connection throughout life,

00:52:22.660 --> 00:52:27.760
whether it is the youngest
person to the senior

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:31.160
or seniors then helping young
people come into the arts

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.140
and having that experience.

00:52:33.140 --> 00:52:40.150
And I think that as I
experience with my own family

00:52:40.150 --> 00:52:44.350
and with my own organization, we're
thinking more about the programs

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:51.270
that we're offering to audiences of
all ages and understanding in fact

00:52:51.270 --> 00:52:57.510 position:56%
that music and dance and theater can
be even more important as you age

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:01.420 position:56%
and it's not just because you have
more time, but actually it is a part

00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:06.890
of what happens in your whole
physical cycle and your brain

00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:09.660
and keeping yourself healthy.

00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:12.880
So, this is actually something
that I've been thinking about,

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:17.040
not at a fully formed idea yet,
but other than the fact that I see

00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:23.720 position:56%
that some of the most active people
in my life both at work and at home,

00:53:23.720 --> 00:53:27.660
are the ones who are working
and active and engaged still.

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.670
And those are the ones who
are docents and helping

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:36.280
out as teaching assistants
for our education programs.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.530
But, I've really come to think
that developing some programs

00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.280 position:56%
that are sort of health and wellness
programs for people of all ages

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:48.310
and seniors in particular,
would be something

00:53:48.310 --> 00:53:50.310
that would be a great way
for us to benefit from.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.890
But, this is also something
that we don't always know a lot

00:53:52.890 --> 00:53:55.920
about because we're dealing with...

00:53:55.920 --> 00:54:00.170
We're our own age, we're thinking
about bringing young people in.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:06.000
So, it's an area that I
think as our population ages,

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.640
as there's a larger population
that is of a different age,

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:14.110 position:56%
we can think about the role that we
are, in terms of providing services,

00:54:14.110 --> 00:54:19.350
whether active participatory
ones or as patrons.

00:54:19.350 --> 00:54:23.370
So, it's a wonderful question and
it's one that happens to be sort

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:26.140
of resonant for me right now
as we are doing some work.

00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:30.100
Actually, I will tell you a secret
which is that we're doing a program

00:54:30.100 --> 00:54:32.030
that hasn't really
been out there too much

00:54:32.030 --> 00:54:37.370
yet with the National
Institutes of Health.

00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:41.420
And it's around health and
wellness and music and the brain

00:54:41.420 --> 00:54:46.120
and we're looking at how music
has an impact on young kids

00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.730
and what it can do
for music therapy.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:52.290
We talked about that and then all
the way through creative aging.

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.960
So, it's something that is really
on the top of mind right now.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.460
CARLA HAYDEN: Creative aging.

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:58.380
DEBORAH RUTTER: Creative aging.

00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.760
Think about it.

00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:03.760
CARLA HAYDEN: I think we need that.

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.060
Another question.

00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:07.940
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Hi.

00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.420
I work here at the Library
and if I had more time,

00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.070
I'd talk about the author
named Marguerite De Angeli

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:17.170
that influenced both Dr.
Hayden and actually me in going

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:19.900
into a career writing about
Quakers, which is just an aside

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:23.840
to say I ended up getting
a PhD in American Studies.

00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:27.460
But, had you asked me at the
same age about 10 or 12 years old

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.470
who I wanted to be when I grew up,

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:31.520
it would have been
Leonard Bernstein.

00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:32.820
Bernsteen.

00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:34.120
Bernstein.

00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.420
MARIN ALSOP: Bernstein, your right.

00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:36.720
AUDIENCE MEMBER: Bernstein.

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.020
Sorry, my cousins are
Bernsteen, he's Bernstein.

00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:41.730
And the height of my
conducting career was

00:55:41.730 --> 00:55:45.700 position:56%
to conduct the high school orchestra
for one piece in my senior year.

00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:50.690
My question is about talent in
the arts or the idea of talent

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:56.200
which I think as I look back, I
don't know how much talent I did

00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.840
or didn't have, but at a certain
point, it didn't seem to me

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:01.980
that I had the talent to
be an orchestral conductor

00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:03.280
and I went in other directions.

00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:04.580
I also play the violin, by the way.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:10.100 position:56%
But, I think that at the time, there
were senses of role models for women

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:14.160
in those ways and I heard you
all talk about mentorship.

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:19.140
But, I don't actually know the
answer for where talent versus-

00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:21.590
so it's a nature nurture
kind of question I guess.

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:23.120
If you can talk about
that a little more

00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:24.590 position:56%
because it's a big deal in the arts.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:25.890
It seems to me.

00:56:25.890 --> 00:56:29.880 position:56%
CARLA HAYDEN: And before you start,
I'm laughing because I'm the product

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:34.600 position:56%
of two classically trained musicians
and I'm sitting here as a librarian.

00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:38.570
So, that tells you my talent
and why this is so important.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:42.850
A violinist and a pianist,
so talent does...

00:56:42.850 --> 00:56:44.350
MARIN ALSOP: I don't know.

00:56:44.350 --> 00:56:50.040
Maybe I have some very
idealistic view of talent.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:56.170
I think, also I think the word,
creativity is often restricted

00:56:56.170 --> 00:57:02.370
to people who have chosen
the arts as their discipline.

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:10.750
Whereas, I think that creativity
is inherent in being human.

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.470
When people tell me they're tone
deaf or something like that,

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:16.750
I think that's simply not possible.

00:57:16.750 --> 00:57:21.460
You know someone told you that
and you started taking that on.

00:57:21.460 --> 00:57:22.760
Or you can't draw.

00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.620
I was told, "you're terrible
at that," so I always thought,

00:57:26.620 --> 00:57:28.640
"I have no talent for that."

00:57:28.640 --> 00:57:31.490
But, instead if someone
had said, "well, let's see.

00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.790
Let me help you a little bit.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:34.090
Oh that's nice."

00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:37.350
It's all about mentorship
I think and encouragement.

00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:39.330
The thing I like about
the Orch Kids program,

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:43.500
it's not targeting talented kids.

00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:45.270
It's democratic.

00:57:45.270 --> 00:57:47.370
I believe everyone is talented.

00:57:47.370 --> 00:57:51.310
I believe that had that
been a passion for you

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:55.420
and someone had encouraged you,
you could do what I'm doing now.

00:57:55.420 --> 00:58:03.520 position:56%
For me, it's all about opportunity
and exposure and every kid I find...

00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:06.390 position:56%
I became a parent very late in life.

00:58:06.390 --> 00:58:11.370 position:56%
I was amazed at what my kid could
do, but it was only because I had...

00:58:11.370 --> 00:58:15.300
my expectations were this high.

00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.110
So, when I started
with the Orch Kids,

00:58:17.110 --> 00:58:21.520
my expectations were also this
high and then immediately,

00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:25.600
the kids go to wherever
you put the bar and higher.

00:58:25.600 --> 00:58:29.620
I think every child is born
with enormous talent and genius

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:33.100
and we just gradually
suck it out of them.

00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:36.980
(laughter) And that's what
we can't afford to do.

00:58:36.980 --> 00:58:39.770
So, maybe I'm very
idealistic about this,

00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:44.360
but I believe you have
the talent that I have.

00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:48.030
DEBORAH RUTTER: I have a couple of
different stories of circumstances

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:55.250
where a really influential teacher
or conductor would actually say to

00:58:55.250 --> 00:59:01.000 position:56%
and gave examples where hard work is
actually more important than talent.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:08.480
Because somebody who has raw talent
may coast without the hard work.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.550
So, the people who we see as
genius are using raw talent

00:59:13.550 --> 00:59:16.060
and then working really hard at it.

00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:20.920
And so that's why I would always
encourage to stick with it.

00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:23.550
My problem was I didn't want
to be alone in a practice room.

00:59:23.550 --> 00:59:24.850
MARIN ALSOP: Right.

00:59:24.850 --> 00:59:27.480
It's whether you have the
personality to endure it.

00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.780
I think. DEBORAH RUTTER: Exactly.

00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:36.050
Exactly. But, I love it like crazy
and I dedicate enormous amounts

00:59:36.050 --> 00:59:41.440 position:56%
of my time in a different way really
supporting it and experiencing it.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:43.940
So, it's really about
how you spend your time.

00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.610
So, absolutely, you could
have been a conductor.

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.920
There's a long path to travel, but.

00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:53.410
MOLLY SMITH: And I
would totally agree.

00:59:53.410 --> 00:59:57.690
I think that there's like 5 or 10 %
talent because everybody has talent

00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:04.450
and the rest of it is perseverance,
persistence, gutsiness, aggressive,

01:00:04.450 --> 01:00:08.820
pushing through all of the
rejection and being able to say,

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.440
"no, I can still do this."

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:13.690
But, that also has to do
with self-image, you know?

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:17.020
The people around you supporting
you, saying, "You can do it.

01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.320
You can do it."

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.820
And that's one of the most
important things that we can give

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:27.440
to young people and adults
as well because I believe

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:33.930 position:56%
in lifelong education, that
curiosity is through an entire life.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.690
And even if you don't
think you have the talent

01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:39.010
to do this thing, just try.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:40.800
Just try. Go out and do it.

01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:42.550
It's amazing what it will open up.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.600
CARLA HAYDEN: And to
be able to recognize it

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.000 position:56%
and that's sometimes the part
that's really gripping when you know

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.830
that young people might
not have the opportunity

01:00:52.830 --> 01:00:57.840 position:56%
to have their particular talent
recognized at an early enough stage.

01:00:57.840 --> 01:01:00.080
Maybe you're not good at
drawing, but there's a child

01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.060
over there that's singing
all the time.

01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.360
This one is doing that.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:08.060
The greatest gift my parents
gave me was at 12 we all agreed

01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:14.370
that when they looked at
musical notes, they heard music

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:17.570
and when I looked at
text, I heard words.

01:01:17.570 --> 01:01:18.870
And that was ok.

01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:24.420
And then I went off with
words and appreciated it.

01:01:24.420 --> 01:01:25.940
But, to know.

01:01:25.940 --> 01:01:29.800 position:56%
Sometimes you drive in neighborhoods
and you look on corners

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:32.620
and you see people and you say wow,

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:35.550
when did the light
go out in their eyes?

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:38.470
When was that 4 year old
not given that chance

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:39.920
to do that and here they are.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.020
DEBORAH RUTTER: That's the
spiral that is so difficult.

01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:46.760
That if you get into that, if you
are caught somewhere in that spiral

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.320
and you don't have the network
that can give it to you.

01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:53.750 position:56%
So, it has to come from teachers, it
has to come from community leaders,

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:56.310
it has to come from
somebody if it can't come

01:01:56.310 --> 01:01:58.440
from your parents and mentors.

01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:02.960
And that's why we have to have
a network that supports people.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.260
CARLA HAYDEN: Right.

01:02:04.260 --> 01:02:10.930
I think we have time for one more
question or comment and to really

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:13.390
in this celebration of
Women's History Month,

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.750
I can't thank you all enough.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:18.890
AUDIENCE MEMBER: I wanted
to echo everyone else

01:02:18.890 --> 01:02:21.030
and just saying thank you
all so much for coming out

01:02:21.030 --> 01:02:23.830
and sharing your experiences
for this event.

01:02:23.830 --> 01:02:28.740
My question is as women of power,
how do you all weave the concept

01:02:28.740 --> 01:02:33.200
of intersectionality into your
organizations in regard to hiring

01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:35.920
or promoting or just
generally creating a pipeline

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:42.450
so that arts leadership may be
more inclusive to women of color?

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:46.420
DEBORAH RUTTER: Well, first
of all you have to have,

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:51.520
you have to be very explicit
in saying this is a priority

01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.860
and having broad ownership,
because if just one person owns it,

01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.360
it won't, it can't succeed.

01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.200
But, if you can get broad ownership
throughout your institution.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:06.790 position:56%
In my case, it was extremely helpful

01:03:06.790 --> 01:03:10.790
that the board was
right there with me.

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:15.570
If not perhaps ahead of me
when I came to the Center

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:18.290
and therefore putting
the structure in place.

01:03:18.290 --> 01:03:21.910
It does though mean that you
have to put mandates in place.

01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:27.290
And so for us now, there can
never be a final candidate pool

01:03:27.290 --> 01:03:31.160
that doesn't have diversity
in the pool.

01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.530 position:56%
And a conversation that always takes
place both from the hiring people.

01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:39.010
Now I'm lucky because
I have an institution

01:03:39.010 --> 01:03:44.510
that has really great reach and I
want to use the size and the reach

01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:49.550
of this institution to help build
as many future leaders as possible.

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.520
But, I believe it can happen
in any kind of organization.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:56.170
It has to be something that
you believe as a core value.

01:03:56.170 --> 01:03:59.750
And you have to have the whole
team doing the same thing.

01:03:59.750 --> 01:04:02.450
Because the one person isn't
doing all of the hiring.

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:04.440
There are a lot of
people doing the hiring,

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:08.250
but I think that Molly's
given a great description

01:04:08.250 --> 01:04:10.430
because there are jobs everywhere.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:15.360
It's not just in sort of the
administrative aspect of it.

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.440
There are jobs throughout
our buildings

01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:20.090
that are supporting
the arts and are a way

01:04:20.090 --> 01:04:24.660
into our organization MARIN ALSOP:
We're looking also to trying

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.600
to create diversity on
our board of directors.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:33.680 position:56%
I'm sure everyone, the good thing is
that it's an open conversation now

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:37.710
and I think there is an
awareness of the dearth

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.960
of diversity throughout our field.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.660
So, I think that's exciting
because people are willing

01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:46.240
to have the conversation
and really try

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.970
to at least change the
landscape to a certain degree.

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:53.630
MOLLY SMITH: We look at it
holistically at Arena Stage.

01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:56.940
When I came to Arena, our
audience was not diverse

01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:00.430
so I walked the streets
of Washington, DC.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.370
I went into the churches
in Washington, DC.

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:05.350
I went into some of
the Baptist churches

01:05:05.350 --> 01:05:08.720
and of course Washington DC
is a black and white city.

01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:14.470
And there was programming that we
had on stage that really focused

01:05:14.470 --> 01:05:16.060
on the African American experience,

01:05:16.060 --> 01:05:18.360
but our audiences didn't
reflect that.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:21.640
And this is unusual
because Arena started

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:27.000
as the first integrated theater
in Washington, DC 68 years ago.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.910
And so it's in our bloodlines,
the importance of this.

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:35.430
And so I realized it all happens
through programming and so

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:37.630
about a third to half of the work

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:41.150
that we do every year is
around people of color.

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:42.690
When I was in the Baptist churches,

01:05:42.690 --> 01:05:47.110
I saw the way in which people
welcomed people is they would stand

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.270
outside the door and shake hands

01:05:49.270 --> 01:05:51.740
with people all the
way into the church.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.710
So, we changed our usher structure.

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:55.190
So, there are people all the way

01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:57.460
through the theater
saying, "welcome, come in."

01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:01.620
We have people all the way outside
because theaters tend to be places

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:04.150
where people are a little
bit nervous coming in.

01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:11.340 position:56%
And so eventually, now almost 30%
of our audience are people of color.

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:14.620
That's one of the most
diverse in the United States -

01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.480
one of the top ones in theaters.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:21.640
And that's something that
we work on on a daily basis.

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.660
Our staff is diverse.

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.910
Our programming is diverse.

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:28.530
Our board is becoming more diverse.

01:06:28.530 --> 01:06:33.800 position:56%
We have a wonderful chairman,
Judith Batty who's African American.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:37.540
And we just keep working at
it and as you said Marin,

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:39.840
it's moment by moment,
it's day by day.

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:43.440
It's doing exactly what Deborah
says, which is when we have a pool

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:46.980
of people, what we're looking
at for a particular position,

01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:51.050
there has to be a person
of color within that pool

01:06:51.050 --> 01:06:54.000
who can get the job, right?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.580
It can't just be, "well,
we can't find anybody."

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:59.160
Go out again, keep looking.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.280
And so that's where we
as administrators need

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.300
to keep our own feet in the fire.

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:10.040
CARLA HAYDEN: I can't thank you
all enough because even though,

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:12.010
and all of you that are here today,

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:14.210
because this is Women's
History Month,

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:18.010
but women's history
is all year round.

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:32.000
And I just thank you so much.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:38.060
DEBORAH RUTTER: We're
so proud of you, Carla.

01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:40.210
