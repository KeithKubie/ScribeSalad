Hey Guys,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.570
Thanks for checking out Migrationology.com.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.360
My name is Mark but I sometimes go by Migration
Mark.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:31.259
After graduating from university in 2008,
I decided to travel around the world and pursue

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:51.299
my passions.

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:56.870
Since then I've been slowly traveling from
place to place learning cultural lessons,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:16.530
eating as much local street food as possible
and trying to make a little money from my

00:01:16.530 --> 00:02:27.459
travel blog along the way.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.469
Migrationology is not only about traveling
around the world, but also about finding a

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:34.750
sustainable way to live your dreams and pursue
your passions!

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.602
I am a lover of traveling around the world,
and I am able to continue traveling by maintaining

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:41.602
a travel blog.

00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:41.610
Are you ready to take on the Migration?
