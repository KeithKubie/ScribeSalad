00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:33.310 align:start position:0%
don't immediately start there yeah or me
 

00:08:33.310 --> 00:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
don't immediately start there yeah or me
it<00:08:33.640><c> could</c><00:08:33.849><c> go</c><00:08:33.940><c> in</c><00:08:34.029><c> a</c><00:08:34.089><c> totally</c><00:08:34.240><c> different</c>

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:34.390 align:start position:0%
it could go in a totally different

00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:36.190 align:start position:0%
direction so I think that's that those
 

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.069 align:start position:0%
direction so I think that's that those
are<00:08:36.310><c> great</c><00:08:36.490><c> opportunities</c><00:08:37.120><c> there</c><00:08:37.149><c> which</c><00:08:37.810><c> i</c>

00:08:38.069 --> 00:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
are great opportunities there which i
 

00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:41.040 align:start position:0%
are great opportunities there which i
