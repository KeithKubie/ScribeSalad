your gut health and then we're gonna

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
your gut health and then we're gonna
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.410
your gut health and then we're gonna
take probiotics for 30 days and see if

people have this same problem but I feel
 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.740
people have this same problem but I feel
that I have a low tolerance for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750
that I have a low tolerance for
 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.289
that I have a low tolerance for
spiciness both on the way in and on the

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299
spiciness both on the way in and on the
 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.480

Popeyes like yeah I think my digestion
 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.389
Popeyes like yeah I think my digestion
is pretty normal the first thing we

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399
is pretty normal the first thing we
 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.550
is pretty normal the first thing we
wanted to analyze with our poop samples

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560
wanted to analyze with our poop samples
 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.310

was how diverse our microbiome was and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
was how diverse our microbiome was and

someone's microbiome is with something

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409
someone's microbiome is with something
 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.980
someone's microbiome is with something
called The Simpsons diversity index with

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990
called The Simpsons diversity index with
 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.740
called The Simpsons diversity index with
zero being no diversity that's bad and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
zero being no diversity that's bad and
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.289
zero being no diversity that's bad and
one being infinite diversity which is

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299
one being infinite diversity which is
 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.260
one being infinite diversity which is
actually impossible but 0.99 for example

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270
actually impossible but 0.99 for example
 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.300
actually impossible but 0.99 for example
would be a very diverse good number so

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
would be a very diverse good number so
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.609
would be a very diverse good number so

nourish those bacteria by eating lots of

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359
nourish those bacteria by eating lots of
 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:25.750

prebiotic foods like garlic onions I eat

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760

not necessarily another way to also help

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870
not necessarily another way to also help

not necessarily another way to also help
increase your microbiome diversity is to

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329
increase your microbiome diversity is to
 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.930
increase your microbiome diversity is to
take probiotics or a probiotic food like

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940
take probiotics or a probiotic food like
 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.059
take probiotics or a probiotic food like
yogurts or kefir I don't know if that's

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069
yogurts or kefir I don't know if that's
 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.530
yogurts or kefir I don't know if that's
how you pronounce it but I think it is

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540
how you pronounce it but I think it is
 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.030
how you pronounce it but I think it is
so the next thing we did is we actually

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040
so the next thing we did is we actually
 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.789
so the next thing we did is we actually
took probiotics for 30 days and then we

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799
took probiotics for 30 days and then we
 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.979
took probiotics for 30 days and then we
analyzed our poop again yes we pooped in

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989
analyzed our poop again yes we pooped in
 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.050
analyzed our poop again yes we pooped in
a cup twice we are champions and we

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060
a cup twice we are champions and we
 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.099
a cup twice we are champions and we
wanted to see if those probiotics

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109
wanted to see if those probiotics
 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.440
wanted to see if those probiotics
actually affected our microbiome and the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450
actually affected our microbiome and the
 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.150
actually affected our microbiome and the
diversity in our gut initially we saw

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160
diversity in our gut initially we saw
 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.430
diversity in our gut initially we saw
that your diversity index was 0.72 in

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440
that your diversity index was 0.72 in
 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.780
that your diversity index was 0.72 in
your second sample after taking

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790
your second sample after taking

probiotics
 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:03.460

it was 0.73 0.74 so pretty much the same

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470
it was 0.73 0.74 so pretty much the same
 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.110
it was 0.73 0.74 so pretty much the same
ok so then that means that the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120
ok so then that means that the
 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.270
ok so then that means that the
probiotics didn't have a major impact on

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280
probiotics didn't have a major impact on
 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.340
