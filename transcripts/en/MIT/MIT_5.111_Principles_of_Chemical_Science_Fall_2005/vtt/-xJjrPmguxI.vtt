00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.865
All right.
Today we are continuing in

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.925
oxidation-reduction.
And so we started this a little

00:00:21.925 --> 00:00:25.189
bit last week.
And we talked briefly about

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.373
balancing equations which,
as you recall,

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:32.928
is really about counting.
It is not an intellectually

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:36.857
challenging topic and just
requires making sure that you

00:00:36.857 --> 00:00:39.142
counted everything
appropriately.

00:00:39.142 --> 00:00:42.285
You have to be a little bit
careful doing it,

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:45.928
but it is really not too hard.
Being able to balance

00:00:45.928 --> 00:00:50.071
oxidation-reduction equations,
then, allows you to go on to

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:55.000
talk about the things that we
will be talking about today.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.181
Today we are going to cover
electrochemical cells,

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:00.909
Faraday's law,
and the relationship between

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:04.610
delta G and cell potential.
If everyone could quiet down a

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.181
little bit, I can hear a lot of
noise in the background.

00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:11.558
I realize you are still
settling down and pulling out

00:01:11.558 --> 00:01:14.285
your notes.
As I have mentioned all the way

00:01:14.285 --> 00:01:16.883
through the lectures I have
given so far,

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:20.714
you have to remember all the
things you have learned because

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.857
they are going to come back
again.

00:01:22.857 --> 00:01:26.493
Today we will be back to
thermodynamics and talking about

00:01:26.493 --> 00:01:30.000
spontaneous reactions and delta
G.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.689
This all ties in together.
These units are really more

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.726
applications of things that you
have already learned in the

00:01:37.726 --> 00:01:41.624
first half of the course.
And currently we are in Chapter

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:43.781
12.
So, an electrochemical cell.

00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:45.939
What is an electrochemical
cell?

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.116
Well, it is any device in which
you have an electric current.

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:54.153
An electric current is just the
flow of electrons through a

00:01:54.153 --> 00:01:56.450
circuit.
And the current is either

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.000
produced by a spontaneous
reaction.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.529
See where delta G is going to
come into this?

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:07.941
It is either produced by
spontaneous reaction or used to

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:10.989
bring about a non-spontaneous
reaction.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.882
You can use an electrochemical
cell to force a non-spontaneous

00:02:15.882 --> 00:02:19.331
reaction to go.
A battery, which most of you

00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:23.823
are familiar with and use in
many of the gadgets that you

00:02:23.823 --> 00:02:27.112
have, is really just a
collection of these

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:32.153
electrochemical cells.
And, as we will see perhaps at

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:36.459
the end of today's lecture or
next time, all these principles

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.406
that you are learning about
oxidation-reduction apply to

00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:44.282
oxidation-reduction reactions
that happen in your body.

00:02:44.282 --> 00:02:48.732
The same principles that apply
for a battery apply for chemical

00:02:48.732 --> 00:02:52.966
reactions that are in your body
that are important for human

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:55.334
health.
We will talk about that as

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:57.416
well.
Here is an example of an

00:02:57.416 --> 00:03:01.472
electrochemical cell.
This is a pretty simple

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.418
electrochemical cell.
We have two beakers here.

00:03:04.418 --> 00:03:07.747
And we have electrodes,
which are connected by wires,

00:03:07.747 --> 00:03:11.077
and they are connected to
something that can read the

00:03:11.077 --> 00:03:13.702
current that is coming through
the system.

00:03:13.702 --> 00:03:17.352
There is also a salt bridge,
which we will talk about in a

00:03:17.352 --> 00:03:19.977
few minutes.
This would be a fairly simple

00:03:19.977 --> 00:03:23.691
one that one could construct.
And I like to joke about what

00:03:23.691 --> 00:03:27.532
people would say in the old days
when I go and do fundraising

00:03:27.532 --> 00:03:31.438
stuff for MIT and meet alumni
that graduated from this place a

00:03:31.438 --> 00:03:35.147
really long time ago.
They probably say,

00:03:35.147 --> 00:03:38.078
well, before we could even do
our problem sets,

00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:41.519
we had to make our own
batteries to be able to get some

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.897
electricity to see by.
Your life is a bit simpler now.

00:03:44.897 --> 00:03:48.911
You should hear some of the old
stories of what MIT students had

00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:50.441
to go through.
All right.

00:03:50.441 --> 00:03:53.308
This is a schematic view of
what you just saw.

00:03:53.308 --> 00:03:56.877
And we will walk through and
talk about all the different

00:03:56.877 --> 00:04:00.000
parts of the electrochemical
cell.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.121
This I drew,
actually, myself.

00:04:02.121 --> 00:04:06.512
I think actually I stole maybe
parts of it, or did I draw the

00:04:06.512 --> 00:04:09.146
whole thing?
I cannot quite remember.

00:04:09.146 --> 00:04:12.512
But, again, this is my
depiction of the beaker.

00:04:12.512 --> 00:04:16.390
As I have mentioned in the
past, art was really not my

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.951
strength.
This is a beaker over here

00:04:18.951 --> 00:04:21.292
filled with liquid.
In this case,

00:04:21.292 --> 00:04:24.073
we have ions dissolved in the
solution.

00:04:24.073 --> 00:04:27.951
We have zinc plus two 
and sulfate

00:04:27.951 --> 00:04:31.868
dissolved.
Another beaker over here.

00:04:31.868 --> 00:04:36.203
In this beaker we have a zinc
electrode, and this is at the

00:04:36.203 --> 00:04:38.894
anode.
And so this is a piece of zinc

00:04:38.894 --> 00:04:43.229
solid stuck into this beaker,
where you have this solution.

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:46.293
There is a wire connecting two
electrodes.

00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:50.554
On the other side we have the
cathode, and this is made of

00:04:50.554 --> 00:04:53.693
copper solid.
And it is sitting in a beaker

00:04:53.693 --> 00:04:57.654
that has copper plus two
and also sulfate in

00:04:57.654 --> 00:05:01.314
it.
And so let's look at what would

00:05:01.314 --> 00:05:04.002
happen if this reaction where to
run.

00:05:04.002 --> 00:05:07.959
Over here, at the anode,
we have zinc solid

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:12.438
being oxidized to zinc plus 
two, so the reaction is

00:05:12.438 --> 00:05:15.723
shown down here.
This electrode actually gets

00:05:15.723 --> 00:05:20.054
consumed during the reaction.
You actually have solid being

00:05:20.054 --> 00:05:23.638
converted to zinc plus two
in solution,

00:05:23.638 --> 00:05:27.371
so you have a change in phase.
And as that happens,

00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:32.000
two electrons are generated
from that reaction.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.046
And the electrons then will go
through the wire,

00:05:35.046 --> 00:05:38.805
and the current will be read.
They will go through the wire

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:42.240
over to the copper solid.
And over here they will pass

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.351
into this beaker,
and the electrons will find the

00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:48.981
copper plus two,
as shown in this equation down

00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:52.092
here, and this will form copper
solid.

00:05:52.092 --> 00:05:55.916
You are actually going to have
extra copper plating onto the

00:05:55.916 --> 00:05:58.509
electrode.
This electrode is going to get

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.027
bigger.
And this one will be consumed

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:06.293
in the course of the reaction.
And so this is a little picture

00:06:06.293 --> 00:06:10.139
over here of electrons coming
into the copper solid,

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:13.216
finding the copper plus
two,

00:06:13.216 --> 00:06:17.622
and the copper plus two then is
reduced at the cathode to copper

00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:20.000
solid.
And the blow-up on the other

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.426
side shows the copper solid,
once electrons leave,

00:06:23.426 --> 00:06:26.643
say the zinc solid,
electrons leave,

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:30.000
you form zinc plus two.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.066
These are sort of blow-ups of
the reactions that are happening

00:06:34.066 --> 00:06:37.266
at the cathode and anode.
And so as this happens,

00:06:37.266 --> 00:06:40.533
you will see there will be a
change in the charge.

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:44.666
Here we have a zinc solid
or zinc zero going to zinc

00:06:44.666 --> 00:06:48.000
plus two.
To balance that charge there is

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.933
a salt bridge,
and you will have some kind of

00:06:50.933 --> 00:06:53.333
ion come in to neutralize the
charge.

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:57.000
And here we have chloride
minus.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.589
On the other side,
we are going from copper plus

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:03.415
two to copper zero.

00:07:03.415 --> 00:07:07.539
And so you will have a
positively charged ion coming in

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:10.594
to help neutralize that change
in charge.

00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:14.489
Over here, something is being
oxidized at the anode.

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:17.009
Anode is where you have
oxidation.

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.446
And something is being reduced
at the cathode.

00:07:20.446 --> 00:07:23.119
Cathode is where you have
reduction.

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:29.000
We could write that cell in a
little bit more simple fashion.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.957
Instead of having that picture,
we can convey to others what

00:07:33.957 --> 00:07:37.655
that picture showed us by this
equation here.

00:07:37.655 --> 00:07:40.512
We have the two reactions going
on.

00:07:40.512 --> 00:07:44.966
We have the zinc reaction,
which is shown on one side.

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:49.924
And that reaction was the zinc
solid going to the

00:07:49.924 --> 00:07:54.042
zinc plus two.
And this single line here

00:07:54.042 --> 00:07:59.000
represents a change in phase,
a phase boundary.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.669
Solid going to an ion dissolved
in aqueous solution.

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:06.267
The two lines right here
represent the salt bridge.

00:08:06.267 --> 00:08:09.002
This equation,
then, is telling you one

00:08:09.002 --> 00:08:13.320
reaction going on in one beaker
separated by the salt bridge.

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:17.277
This would be the reaction
going on in the other beaker.

00:08:17.277 --> 00:08:21.739
And so over here we have copper
plus two aqueous

00:08:21.739 --> 00:08:26.200
with a single line for the phase
boundary going to copper solid.

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:29.828
If you see this kind of

00:08:29.828 --> 00:08:34.597
notation, you can envision that
electrochemical cell with the

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:37.856
two beakers, the wire and the
salt bridge.

00:08:37.856 --> 00:08:42.625
And this is a reaction going on
on one side, and the reaction

00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:45.964
going on on the other side.
As I mentioned,

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:49.064
in that particular
electrochemical cell,

00:08:49.064 --> 00:08:53.276
zinc is being consumed.
Zinc solid is being

00:08:53.276 --> 00:08:56.297
consumed.
It is being converted to zinc

00:08:56.297 --> 00:09:00.411
plus two.
Whereas, copper solid

00:09:00.411 --> 00:09:02.746
is being deposited onto
the electrode.

00:09:02.746 --> 00:09:04.754
In that case,
you have copper plus two

00:09:04.754 --> 00:09:07.143
aqueous going to
copper solid.

00:09:07.143 --> 00:09:10.075
That is being deposited.
And the amount of zinc that is

00:09:10.075 --> 00:09:13.278
being consumed and the amount of
copper that is deposited is

00:09:13.278 --> 00:09:16.590
going to be proportional to the
charge that passes through the

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.576
system or to the electrons that
pass through the system.

00:09:19.576 --> 00:09:22.127
And that makes sense,
because if you have a zinc

00:09:22.127 --> 00:09:24.788
solid going to zinc
plus two,

00:09:24.788 --> 00:09:28.045
you have two electrons formed,
which would then go through to

00:09:28.045 --> 00:09:31.731
the other side.
The amount of charge that is

00:09:31.731 --> 00:09:35.443
going to go through has to do
with the amount of zinc that is

00:09:35.443 --> 00:09:39.154
consumed, which would also then
have to do with the amount of

00:09:39.154 --> 00:09:42.804
copper that is deposited when
the electrons get to the other

00:09:42.804 --> 00:09:44.412
side.
And so this is a law.

00:09:44.412 --> 00:09:46.948
We don't have very many laws in
chemistry.

00:09:46.948 --> 00:09:50.659
A lot of times we have theories
that help to explain observed

00:09:50.659 --> 00:09:52.762
information.
Chemistry really is an

00:09:52.762 --> 00:09:55.917
experimental science,
so we observe a lot of things,

00:09:55.917 --> 00:10:00.000
and then we try to rationalize
why they are true.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.758
There are not a whole lot of
laws, but this is one of them.

00:10:04.758 --> 00:10:07.712
All right.
Let's just kind of look at

00:10:07.712 --> 00:10:11.979
little movies of this procedure
of what is happening.

00:10:11.979 --> 00:10:16.164
And here we are going to see
oxidation at the anode.

00:10:16.164 --> 00:10:20.020
We can pretend this is our
solid electrode here.

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:22.153
And we have,
say, the zinc.

00:10:22.153 --> 00:10:26.912
And here is the aqueous part,
so these are water molecules.

00:10:26.912 --> 00:10:30.194
And you are going to see
electrons leave,

00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:34.153
go up.
And then you are going to have

00:10:34.153 --> 00:10:36.882
the solid be oxidized to,
in this case,

00:10:36.882 --> 00:10:40.687
zinc plus two,
and it will go into solution.

00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:44.564
Let me just play this for you.
You can actually see the

00:10:44.564 --> 00:10:48.225
electrons leave in this movie,
which is interesting.

00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:50.882
There they go.
There are the electrons

00:10:50.882 --> 00:10:53.394
leaving.
You've freed up some of the

00:10:53.394 --> 00:10:56.338
solid, and now you have freed it
up again.

00:10:56.338 --> 00:11:00.000
Now we have zinc plus two.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.795
We had zinc solid,
but now we have consumed some

00:11:04.795 --> 00:11:07.937
of our electrode and it is in
solution.

00:11:07.937 --> 00:11:12.403
Now you know what you are
looking for, I will just play

00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:16.372
that one more time.
The electrons are heading off

00:11:16.372 --> 00:11:20.589
into the wires and you are
consuming your electrode.

00:11:20.589 --> 00:11:23.813
All right.
Let's go the other direction.

00:11:23.813 --> 00:11:28.609
The electrons that left and
passed through the wire are now

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:34.844
coming down to the cathode.
And so those electrons can come

00:11:34.844 --> 00:11:38.974
in and reduce,
say, copper plus two,

00:11:38.974 --> 00:11:43.104
forming copper solid.
We have copper plus two.

00:11:43.104 --> 00:11:47.509
Here come the electrons,
here come the electrons,

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:53.199
and so now you plated those two
copper plus two ions.

00:11:53.199 --> 00:11:56.870
They have become copper solid.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.000
And now your cathode has
expanded.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.491
You have added more metal onto
it.

00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:07.343
It has been deposited or plated
onto this electrode.

00:12:07.343 --> 00:12:10.741
And, again, the amounts are
going to be equal.

00:12:10.741 --> 00:12:14.819
Faraday's law would tell you
that it is all going to be

00:12:14.819 --> 00:12:18.141
proportional,
the amount that is consumed and

00:12:18.141 --> 00:12:22.521
the amount that is produced is
all going to be equal to the

00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:26.146
number of electrons that pass
through the system.

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:30.450
Let me just show you one more
example of why this could be

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:38.095
useful in terms of the plating.
In this little experiment,

00:12:38.095 --> 00:12:46.130
we have a steel spoon.
The steel spoon will act like

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:52.273
an electrode and get plated with
copper.

00:12:52.273 --> 00:12:57.000
There is the copper wire.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.295
That is pretty simple.
You can see how it can get

00:13:20.295 --> 00:13:26.459
deposited on top of this,
which was acting as an

00:13:26.459 --> 00:13:31.000
electrode in this case.
All right.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
As you probably have figured
out, yeah?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000
You often will have to figure
that kind of thing out.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.538
In the example that I showed
you, it was set up to work like

00:13:48.538 --> 00:13:51.000
that.
But, as we will talk about,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.461
it depends if it is going to be
a spontaneous reaction or a

00:13:55.461 --> 00:13:59.823
non-spontaneous reaction.
If you have a cell where it is

00:13:59.823 --> 00:14:02.680
a spontaneous reaction,
you can figure out which

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.145
reaction will occur at the
cathode and which will occur at

00:14:06.145 --> 00:14:08.515
the anode.
There is only way you can put

00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:11.676
those if you have particular
ingredients for it to be

00:14:11.676 --> 00:14:14.107
spontaneous.
And so we will actually talk

00:14:14.107 --> 00:14:16.296
about that at the end of the
lecture.

00:14:16.296 --> 00:14:19.700
In that particular case it was
just stated as this is the

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.799
reaction happening here and
here, but which will go,

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:25.413
which place,
will depend on whether you want

00:14:25.413 --> 00:14:29.000
it to be spontaneous or
non-spontaneous.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.063
That is a good question,
and we will definitely come to

00:14:33.063 --> 00:14:35.395
that.
In terms of Faraday's law,

00:14:35.395 --> 00:14:38.706
it is proportional,
and that means you can do

00:14:38.706 --> 00:14:41.866
calculations.
One could figure out how much

00:14:41.866 --> 00:14:46.456
zinc would get consumed or how
much copper would get deposited

00:14:46.456 --> 00:14:51.121
if you add a particular current
flowing for a particular amount

00:14:51.121 --> 00:14:53.905
of time.
And these are actually fairly

00:14:53.905 --> 00:14:58.194
simple calculations to do,
and we will just go through one

00:14:58.194 --> 00:15:02.206
of them.
The first step would be to

00:15:02.206 --> 00:15:06.448
figure out how much charge went
through the system.

00:15:06.448 --> 00:15:11.454
We have Q, magnitude of charge
in coulombs, which unit is C.

00:15:11.454 --> 00:15:16.630
It is going to be equal to the
current, and that is in amperes

00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:21.551
or A-- and here is a useful
conversion for you to remember,

00:15:21.551 --> 00:15:26.642
and this will be given to you
on a test-- times the amount of

00:15:26.642 --> 00:15:30.261
time.
How much current times time

00:15:30.261 --> 00:15:33.696
will tell you the magnitude of
the charge.

00:15:33.696 --> 00:15:37.717
That is pretty simple,
and that equation would be

00:15:37.717 --> 00:15:42.073
given to you as well.
We are told that we had one amp

00:15:42.073 --> 00:15:45.675
for one hour,
and we converted it to seconds

00:15:45.675 --> 00:15:50.198
so you can get the right units.
And we can find out the

00:15:50.198 --> 00:15:53.717
magnitude of the charge,
then, in coulombs,

00:15:53.717 --> 00:16:00.000
because these units multiplied
together will get you coulombs.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.139
Then, step two is to figure out
how many moles of electrons that

00:16:05.139 --> 00:16:09.219
charge is equal to.
And we have Faraday's constant,

00:16:09.219 --> 00:16:11.993
which will also be provided to
you.

00:16:11.993 --> 00:16:14.848
And its units,
using the conversion,

00:16:14.848 --> 00:16:18.438
coulomb per mole.
And it also is equal to one

00:16:18.438 --> 00:16:23.333
Faraday, which is usually kind
of a squiggly kind of F symbol

00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.720
here.
And so then,

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.473
if we go through and we use
Faraday's constant,

00:16:28.473 --> 00:16:33.041
we can figure out that that
number of coulombs convert to

00:16:33.041 --> 00:16:37.181
moles.
And so you would get 0.0373

00:16:37.181 --> 00:16:41.222
moles of electrons.
This is just a conversion using

00:16:41.222 --> 00:16:45.181
Faraday's constant.
And then we have to figure out

00:16:45.181 --> 00:16:48.898
how many moles of the particular
element, zinc,

00:16:48.898 --> 00:16:52.212
in this case,
or copper, are deposited and

00:16:52.212 --> 00:16:54.636
convert to grams.
We know, now,

00:16:54.636 --> 00:16:59.000
how many electrons went through
our system.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.564
And so now we just need to
figure out, for every one mole

00:17:03.564 --> 00:17:07.150
of zinc consumed,
how many moles of electrons

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:10.981
would have left.
And, in a particular example we

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:14.322
had, what would it be?
How many electrons?

00:17:14.322 --> 00:17:18.642
Two, because we went from zinc
to zinc plus two.

00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:21.332
We are talking about two

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:25.000
electrons for every mole of
zinc.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.004
And then we can calculate moles
and convert to grams using the

00:17:30.004 --> 00:17:33.614
molecular mass of zinc,
which we can look up.

00:17:33.614 --> 00:17:37.962
We get 1.2 grams that are going
to be consumed at that

00:17:37.962 --> 00:17:42.884
particular time with that kind
of current passing through the

00:17:42.884 --> 00:17:45.838
system.
We can do the same thing with

00:17:45.838 --> 00:17:48.545
copper.
We have the same number of

00:17:48.545 --> 00:17:52.811
moles of electrons that are
going through our system.

00:17:52.811 --> 00:17:57.159
Now we just need to know,
for every one mole of copper

00:17:57.159 --> 00:18:02.000
deposited, how many electrons
are required?

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.380
And that is two again,
because we were taking copper

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:10.245
plus two to copper solid.

00:18:10.245 --> 00:18:15.312
We need two electrons for every
one mole of copper that gets

00:18:15.312 --> 00:18:18.147
deposited.
And then we can use the

00:18:18.147 --> 00:18:22.098
molecular mass to find out the
number of grams.

00:18:22.098 --> 00:18:25.791
And since these weigh a very
similar amount,

00:18:25.791 --> 00:18:30.000
it is about the same number of
grams.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.756
If there was a very difference
in molecular mass then that

00:18:33.756 --> 00:18:36.854
wouldn't be true.
These are not always near each

00:18:36.854 --> 00:18:37.909
other.
All right.

00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:40.875
That is just how you do one of
these problems.

00:18:40.875 --> 00:18:44.829
They are really pretty simple.
And there are some of those at

00:18:44.829 --> 00:18:47.268
the end, actually,
of the problem set.

00:18:47.268 --> 00:18:50.431
The book has things in a sort
of different order,

00:18:50.431 --> 00:18:54.254
so you will be able to do the
first part of the problem set

00:18:54.254 --> 00:18:57.154
and the end of the problem set
at this point.

00:18:57.154 --> 00:19:01.162
All right.
Let me just introduce you to a

00:19:01.162 --> 00:19:04.767
couple of different kinds of
electrochemical cells.

00:19:04.767 --> 00:19:08.011
Up until this point,
we have only talked about

00:19:08.011 --> 00:19:11.832
electrochemical cells where
something was deposited or

00:19:11.832 --> 00:19:14.716
consumed.
But you can use electrodes that

00:19:14.716 --> 00:19:17.888
are inert, i.e.,
they don't get consumed in a

00:19:17.888 --> 00:19:20.700
reaction.
An example of that is platinum

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.655
electrode.
As it says, they are not always

00:19:23.655 --> 00:19:27.404
consumed or produced.
You can have an inert electrode

00:19:27.404 --> 00:19:31.000
such as a platinum.
In this case,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.230
we have the platinum electrode
to transfer the electrons

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:39.846
around, but the reaction that is
going on is all in solution.

00:19:39.846 --> 00:19:44.000
This side would be the same.
This is the cathode or the

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.615
reduction reaction.
We have, again,

00:19:46.615 --> 00:19:51.307
the copper plus two.
Two electrons will come through

00:19:51.307 --> 00:19:55.692
the system and plate more copper
solid onto the

00:19:55.692 --> 00:20:00.000
electrode here.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.617
But on the other side,
the anode, where you have the

00:20:03.617 --> 00:20:07.304
oxidation, the oxidation
reaction is happening all in

00:20:07.304 --> 00:20:11.063
solution, so the platinum
electrode is not involved in

00:20:11.063 --> 00:20:12.340
that.
In this case,

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.382
we have chromium plus two
going to chromium plus

00:20:16.382 --> 00:20:18.794
three,
with one electron.

00:20:18.794 --> 00:20:22.340
That is another type of

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.815
electrochemical cell.
And so we can write this and

00:20:25.815 --> 00:20:30.000
look at the notation for this
kind of cell.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.819
In this case,
you put the platinum solid

00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:34.997
in the equation on this
side.

00:20:34.997 --> 00:20:37.945
We have a single line,
meaning there is a phase

00:20:37.945 --> 00:20:41.853
boundary, so we are going from
solid to something in solution.

00:20:41.853 --> 00:20:45.313
And now here is our reaction
that happens at the anode.

00:20:45.313 --> 00:20:49.029
And it has a comma in between.
This indicates that chromium

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:52.874
plus two is going to
chromium plus three,

00:20:52.874 --> 00:20:55.693
but there is no phase boundary
between those,

00:20:55.693 --> 00:20:59.254
so there is a comma.
Then, on the other side,

00:20:59.254 --> 00:21:01.344
the two lines indicating the
salt bridge.

00:21:01.344 --> 00:21:04.531
And then on the other side we
have the copper plus two aqueous

00:21:04.531 --> 00:21:06.726
the line that does indicate

00:21:06.726 --> 00:21:08.868
there is a phase boundary going
to copper.

00:21:08.868 --> 00:21:11.794
This would be for our anode
reaction of chromium going to

00:21:11.794 --> 00:21:14.198
chromium plus three in
one electrode,

00:21:14.198 --> 00:21:16.758
and our cathode reaction,
copper plus two plus two

00:21:16.758 --> 00:21:20.050
electrons going to copper solid.
You

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.976
will see this kind of notation
in these problems as well.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.951
All right.
Another example of an inert

00:21:34.951 --> 00:21:39.339
electrode that's sometimes used,
the hydrogen electrode.

00:21:39.339 --> 00:21:43.566
Often you will see this.
Actually, in the back of your

00:21:43.566 --> 00:21:47.715
book you will see this as well.
The standard hydrogen

00:21:47.715 --> 00:21:52.341
electrode, abbreviated SHE.
Often you will see in papers or

00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:57.048
in your book that they often
need to mention how these redox

00:21:57.048 --> 00:22:01.503
potentials were measured.
And it is often said,

00:22:01.503 --> 00:22:05.441
it is measured against SHE.
And that is what that stands

00:22:05.441 --> 00:22:08.019
for, the standard hydrogen
electrode.

00:22:08.019 --> 00:22:11.599
You can have the hydrogen
electrode on either side,

00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:15.894
at the anode or at the cathode.
Over here would be an example

00:22:15.894 --> 00:22:19.045
when it is at the cathode.
And, in this case,

00:22:19.045 --> 00:22:21.264
H plus is being
reduced.

00:22:21.264 --> 00:22:24.630
And so we have H plus,
and that is aqueous.

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.350
The line for the phase boundary

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:32.307
to H two gas.
And then you have also a phase

00:22:32.307 --> 00:22:37.076
boundary to the platinum solid,
so this is combining

00:22:37.076 --> 00:22:41.230
the platinum and the hydrogen.
Then, on the other side,

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.846
if you had it reacting as an
anode, in this case H two 

00:22:45.846 --> 00:22:49.461
is getting oxidized.
You have the platinum solid

00:22:49.461 --> 00:22:52.615
phase boundary,
a hydrogen gas,

00:22:52.615 --> 00:22:57.000
so that would be oxidation
state zero, phase boundary to H

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.678
plus aqueous.
You can use this sort of

00:23:01.678 --> 00:23:05.664
combination of the platinum and
the hydrogen electrodes as

00:23:05.664 --> 00:23:09.650
either cathodes or anodes.
And so just one example of what

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:12.027
this sort of thing would look
like.

00:23:12.027 --> 00:23:14.615
Here we have our
electrochemical cell.

00:23:14.615 --> 00:23:17.972
Now on this side we just have
the zinc electrode,

00:23:17.972 --> 00:23:21.678
which we mentioned in the
beginning, a zinc solid.

00:23:21.678 --> 00:23:23.986
And then that would be zinc

00:23:23.986 --> 00:23:26.433
plus two in
solution.

00:23:26.433 --> 00:23:30.000
We have our wire,
our salt bridge.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.307
And in the other beaker,
on the other side,

00:23:33.307 --> 00:23:38.188
we have some glass tubing where
you would have the hydrogen gas

00:23:38.188 --> 00:23:42.913
going through into the system.
You also have through that the

00:23:42.913 --> 00:23:45.590
platinum electrode,
platinum solid.

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:49.921
And you have HCl in your
beaker, so that would be H plus

00:23:49.921 --> 00:23:54.015
in your beaker.
Here is the cathode reaction,

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:58.582
so you would be going from H
plus to H zero 

00:23:58.582 --> 00:24:02.189
gas.
And so as you have the reaction

00:24:02.189 --> 00:24:06.496
over here, zinc solid to zinc
plus two,

00:24:06.496 --> 00:24:10.804
lectrons would come
along and would convert H plus

00:24:10.804 --> 00:24:14.970
to H two.
And the electrode here is the

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.571
inert platinum electrode.
Here is my attempt to draw

00:24:18.571 --> 00:24:20.902
little H two gas bubbles going
on.

00:24:20.902 --> 00:24:24.644
This is another type of
electrode that you should know

00:24:24.644 --> 00:24:27.822
the notation for.
It doesn't really change how

00:24:27.822 --> 00:24:31.000
you do problems,
particularly.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.744
But it is important to know
what it stands for.

00:24:34.744 --> 00:24:39.220
Again, this is on the other
side, we have already talked

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:42.069
about that kind of anode.
All right.

00:24:42.069 --> 00:24:45.813
This is, of course,
always things that I really

00:24:45.813 --> 00:24:50.697
like to do, because what I like
to do is go back to something

00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:54.930
you have already learned and
make connections between

00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:59.000
different units of freshman
chemistry.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.205
We are back to delta G.
We are going to now talk about

00:25:04.205 --> 00:25:08.526
cell potential,
and this is abbreviated delta

00:25:08.526 --> 00:25:11.669
E.
Cell potential is often called

00:25:11.669 --> 00:25:17.758
cell voltage and is also called
the electromotive force or EMF.

00:25:17.758 --> 00:25:21.785
You will see all of those
different words,

00:25:21.785 --> 00:25:27.285
and they all stand for the same
thing, this delta E term,

00:25:27.285 --> 00:25:32.000
and the connection with free
energy.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.235
When the electrons flow,
that creates a potential

00:25:36.235 --> 00:25:41.441
difference, a delta E between
the electrodes in the circuit.

00:25:41.441 --> 00:25:46.735
And so the overall free energy
of the cell is related to this

00:25:46.735 --> 00:25:50.264
cell potential by the following
equation.

00:25:50.264 --> 00:25:56.000
We have delta G for that
particular electrochemical cell.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.559
It is going to be equal to
minus N, which is the number of

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:05.279
electrons that are going through
the system, times Faraday's

00:26:05.279 --> 00:26:09.200
constant, which we talked about
a few minutes ago,

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:12.319
and delta E,
the cell potential for that

00:26:12.319 --> 00:26:15.680
particular cell.
There is a nice connection

00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.519
between these two,
and that will be really useful

00:26:19.519 --> 00:26:23.920
in doing these problems.
We can also talk about standard

00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.125
states here.
And the same equation applies

00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:32.449
whether you are talking about
delta G at any particular time

00:26:32.449 --> 00:26:36.773
and delta E at any particular
time, or you are talking about

00:26:36.773 --> 00:26:40.583
the delta G and the delta E in
their standard states.

00:26:40.583 --> 00:26:44.321
Again, this means the same
thing that it has before.

00:26:44.321 --> 00:26:47.546
Delta E nought,
the nought means that you are

00:26:47.546 --> 00:26:51.137
at the standard states.
And delta G nought is also

00:26:51.137 --> 00:26:54.874
delta G in the standard state.
And units, of course,

00:26:54.874 --> 00:26:59.209
are important.
When you are talking about any

00:26:59.209 --> 00:27:03.261
kind of delta E or cell
potential, you are talking about

00:27:03.261 --> 00:27:06.133
things in volts as the units.
All right.

00:27:06.133 --> 00:27:10.479
Now, what those equations mean
is if you calculate a delta E

00:27:10.479 --> 00:27:13.500
for the cell,
the cell voltage or the cell

00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:17.698
potential, you can figure out
whether the reaction will be

00:27:17.698 --> 00:27:22.118
spontaneous or not because you
can use that equation and look

00:27:22.118 --> 00:27:26.390
at, with that particular delta
E, will delta G be negative?

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:30.000
Will it be a spontaneous
reaction?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.863
The first thing we need to
learn how to do is how to

00:27:33.863 --> 00:27:38.106
calculate the cell potentials or
the electromotive force,

00:27:38.106 --> 00:27:42.272
and then we already know how to
convert that to delta G.

00:27:42.272 --> 00:27:46.363
Let's look at this equation
here and calculate what the

00:27:46.363 --> 00:27:51.060
delta E, the cell potential for
this particular electrochemical

00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.015
cell that we have been talking
about is.

00:27:54.015 --> 00:27:58.257
The reaction at the anode,
which we mentioned is the zinc

00:27:58.257 --> 00:28:02.044
reaction.
And this is an oxidation.

00:28:02.044 --> 00:28:06.542
The reaction at the cathode is
the reaction with copper,

00:28:06.542 --> 00:28:11.039
copper plus two and two
electrons going to copper solid.

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:15.455
And that was our reduction

00:28:15.455 --> 00:28:18.563
reaction.
And so now, we can just use a

00:28:18.563 --> 00:28:23.306
simple equation to calculate
delta E nought if we are using

00:28:23.306 --> 00:28:28.457
the standard reduction potential
for the reaction at the cathode

00:28:28.457 --> 00:28:33.282
minus the standard reduction
potential for the couple at the

00:28:33.282 --> 00:28:37.141
anode.
And the point that I want to

00:28:37.141 --> 00:28:40.813
make here is that in this fairly
simple equation,

00:28:40.813 --> 00:28:44.254
this term, this term,
this just E nought here,

00:28:44.254 --> 00:28:46.932
is the standard reduction
potential.

00:28:46.932 --> 00:28:50.756
You don't want to put in
something other than that.

00:28:50.756 --> 00:28:54.580
Don't mess around with changing
signs of reactions.

00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.093
All you want to do is enter a
reduction potential here and a

00:28:59.093 --> 00:29:03.460
reduction potential here.
And then this equation will

00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.112
always work for you.
And you will see what I mean,

00:29:06.112 --> 00:29:08.222
I think, a bit more when we put
that in.

00:29:08.222 --> 00:29:11.306
But if it is the reduction
potential, you would be looking

00:29:11.306 --> 00:29:13.146
up copper two plus to copper
solid.

00:29:13.146 --> 00:29:15.743
Reduction potential,

00:29:15.743 --> 00:29:18.232
you are looking up zinc plus
two to zinc solid.

00:29:18.232 --> 00:29:21.370
You are not caring about which

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:23.967
of these reactions is an
oxidation and which is a

00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:26.673
reduction at this point.
You have figured it out by

00:29:26.673 --> 00:29:30.848
which is at the cathode.
If you know what is at the

00:29:30.848 --> 00:29:35.328
cathode and you know what is at
the anode, then you enter in the

00:29:35.328 --> 00:29:37.746
reduction potential.
Let's do that.

00:29:37.746 --> 00:29:41.657
And you can look up the
standard reduction potentials in

00:29:41.657 --> 00:29:44.502
your book.
There is a table in Chapter 12

00:29:44.502 --> 00:29:48.911
and there is also a table at the
end of the book in Appendix 2.

00:29:48.911 --> 00:29:52.537
You can look up the values.
Here they are written as

00:29:52.537 --> 00:29:56.093
reduction potentials,
and that is what you will see

00:29:56.093 --> 00:29:59.222
in the table.
That is the information you can

00:29:59.222 --> 00:30:02.993
look up.
And then you have your

00:30:02.993 --> 00:30:06.073
equation.
And you will enter in the

00:30:06.073 --> 00:30:10.966
reduction potential for the
reaction at the cathode and

00:30:10.966 --> 00:30:16.583
enter in the reduction potential
for the reaction at the anode.

00:30:16.583 --> 00:30:20.117
Here, you will get out a
positive value,

00:30:20.117 --> 00:30:23.469
1.103 volts.
Again, this is the copper

00:30:23.469 --> 00:30:28.000
reaction and this is the zinc
reaction.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.566
The reason why I am sort of
trying to jump up and down about

00:30:31.566 --> 00:30:34.951
the fact that you should enter
in reduction potentials is

00:30:34.951 --> 00:30:38.336
because if you play around and
all of a sudden switch the

00:30:38.336 --> 00:30:41.903
signs, then you are going to
come out with the wrong answer.

00:30:41.903 --> 00:30:45.348
And one of the important points
about this answer here is,

00:30:45.348 --> 00:30:47.222
is delta E positive or
negative?

00:30:47.222 --> 00:30:50.305
Because that is going to tell
you if the reaction is

00:30:50.305 --> 00:30:53.086
spontaneous or not.
If you do clever things and

00:30:53.086 --> 00:30:56.592
switch the signs for these
around, you will always come out

00:30:56.592 --> 00:30:59.856
with the wrong answer there,
which then affects all the

00:30:59.856 --> 00:31:05.114
problems that you do after that.
As long as you use this

00:31:05.114 --> 00:31:09.710
equation and always enter in a
reduction potential,

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:14.949
you will be fine and you won't
have any of these problems.

00:31:14.949 --> 00:31:18.075
All right.
Is the flow of electrons

00:31:18.075 --> 00:31:21.384
spontaneous for this particular
cell?

00:31:21.384 --> 00:31:26.072
People are saying yes,
and that is the right answer.

00:31:26.072 --> 00:31:31.220
And the way that we know that
is because we remember this

00:31:31.220 --> 00:31:36.000
equation comparing delta E and
delta G.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.748
Here, if this one is positive,
then this term will be negative

00:31:40.748 --> 00:31:45.185
because this is number of moles,
which is always positive.

00:31:45.185 --> 00:31:48.377
And Faraday's constant is
always positive.

00:31:48.377 --> 00:31:52.347
If we have a positive value
here then the net sum is

00:31:52.347 --> 00:31:56.395
negative, this will be negative
and that will make it

00:31:56.395 --> 00:31:59.119
spontaneous.
If delta E is positive,

00:31:59.119 --> 00:32:03.504
delta G will be negative.
And this is true,

00:32:03.504 --> 00:32:07.754
again, if it is delta E nought,
a delta G nought,

00:32:07.754 --> 00:32:11.029
same equation.
If delta G is negative,

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:15.013
will it be spontaneous?
And the answer is yes,

00:32:15.013 --> 00:32:19.793
back to previous units.
In some of the problems in your

00:32:19.793 --> 00:32:24.927
book that you will work on,
they will tell you that this is

00:32:24.927 --> 00:32:29.000
a spontaneous electrochemical
cell.

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:33.264
And then you can figure out
which reaction had to be at the

00:32:33.264 --> 00:32:37.602
anode or which one had to be at
the cathode for that through

00:32:37.602 --> 00:32:41.794
calculating the delta E and
figuring out if it is positive

00:32:41.794 --> 00:32:44.588
or negative.
Therefore, delta G must be

00:32:44.588 --> 00:32:48.411
positive or negative,
spontaneous or non-spontaneous.

00:32:48.411 --> 00:32:51.426
All right.
What do you call it if there is

00:32:51.426 --> 00:32:55.176
a spontaneous reaction?
Here are some terms that you

00:32:55.176 --> 00:32:59.000
should know.
You have a Galvanic cell.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.175
And that is an electrochemical
cell in which the reaction is

00:33:03.175 --> 00:33:05.936
spontaneous.
It can generate an electric

00:33:05.936 --> 00:33:08.413
current.
And your book uses this and

00:33:08.413 --> 00:33:10.748
will say, this is a Galvanic
cell.

00:33:10.748 --> 00:33:14.853
Already then you should know
something about that reaction.

00:33:14.853 --> 00:33:17.684
The other option is an
electrolytic cell.

00:33:17.684 --> 00:33:20.586
In this case,
energy has to be provided to

00:33:20.586 --> 00:33:24.196
the circuit to carry out a
non-spontaneous reaction.

00:33:24.196 --> 00:33:28.513
Sometimes you might just want
that non-spontaneous reaction to

00:33:28.513 --> 00:33:31.790
go.
And then you will have to

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:35.728
supply some form of energy to
get that reaction to work.

00:33:35.728 --> 00:33:39.881
And in the body there are both
of these kinds of reactions.

00:33:39.881 --> 00:33:43.819
Sometimes you would have an
oxidation-reduction reaction

00:33:43.819 --> 00:33:47.041
that is spontaneous,
and that could be used to

00:33:47.041 --> 00:33:50.837
produce some kind of energy.
It would be coupled to an

00:33:50.837 --> 00:33:53.486
energy generating process in the
body.

00:33:53.486 --> 00:33:57.711
Other times the body needs a
reaction that is unfavorable to

00:33:57.711 --> 00:34:00.876
go.
And it has to also supply

00:34:00.876 --> 00:34:03.353
energy to get that reaction to
go.

00:34:03.353 --> 00:34:07.331
And we will talk about
biological examples of these as

00:34:07.331 --> 00:34:08.457
well.
All right.

00:34:08.457 --> 00:34:11.159
Just the brief summary for this
part.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.711
If the cell operates
spontaneously,

00:34:13.711 --> 00:34:16.489
that can be determined by the
delta E.

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.416
A positive value means a
negative value,

00:34:19.416 --> 00:34:23.694
so that will be spontaneous.
And you can get your delta Es

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:27.147
from standard reduction
potentials for the half

00:34:27.147 --> 00:34:30.698
reactions involved.
All right.

00:34:30.698 --> 00:34:35.102
Now we are going to think about
what it means if we have certain

00:34:35.102 --> 00:34:38.736
standard reduction potentials.
If you have a standard

00:34:38.736 --> 00:34:42.301
reduction potential that is a
large positive number,

00:34:42.301 --> 00:34:46.075
or if you have a standard
reduction potential that is a

00:34:46.075 --> 00:34:49.430
large negative number,
or if you are somewhere in

00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:52.016
between.
What does that tell you about

00:34:52.016 --> 00:34:56.000
the properties of those
particular elements?

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.628
A large positive standard
reduction potential means that

00:35:00.628 --> 00:35:05.509
the element is easy to reduce.
Let's look at an example for

00:35:05.509 --> 00:35:08.371
this.
An example, we have F two gas

00:35:08.371 --> 00:35:11.653
plus two electrons going to two
F minus.

00:35:11.653 --> 00:35:16.450
This has a standard reduction

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:21.247
potential of plus 2.87 volts,
and that is a large positive

00:35:21.247 --> 00:35:24.277
number.
What that is going to mean is

00:35:24.277 --> 00:35:30.000
that this is favorable in the
direction it is written.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.005
And favorable means it is easy
to add electrons.

00:35:34.005 --> 00:35:36.988
This wants to be reduced to F
minus.

00:35:36.988 --> 00:35:41.420
It is happy that way.
If it has a large positive sign

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:46.278
for the standard reduction
potential, then delta G will be

00:35:46.278 --> 00:35:50.965
negative, which will be
favorable or spontaneous in that

00:35:50.965 --> 00:35:54.289
direction.
This is a favorable reaction.

00:35:54.289 --> 00:36:00.000
F two is easy to reduce.
It wants to be reduced.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.561
Is it a good oxidizing agent?
Yes.

00:36:03.561 --> 00:36:09.712
Again, a good oxidizing agent
oxidizes other things and is

00:36:09.712 --> 00:36:14.244
reduced itself.
It runs around and tries to

00:36:14.244 --> 00:36:18.992
oxidize other stuff,
which means that it gets

00:36:18.992 --> 00:36:22.985
reduced, which is what it wants
to be.

00:36:22.985 --> 00:36:30.000
It wants to be reduced.
This is a good oxidizing agent.

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:36.470
If we look at the couple here,
F two slash F minus,

00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:42.940
this reduction couple
with a large positive value,

00:36:42.940 --> 00:36:48.023
what we can say is that the
oxidized species,

00:36:48.023 --> 00:36:52.529
that is this one here,
the F two,

00:36:52.529 --> 00:36:59.000
is very oxidizing.
It is a good oxidizing agent.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.002
And this is a table from your
book, so it is not in your

00:37:03.002 --> 00:37:07.077
handout, but you can look it up.
Here is the page number.

00:37:07.077 --> 00:37:11.079
And this is the one we just
looked at, F two to F

00:37:11.079 --> 00:37:13.917
minus.
It says right on the top,

00:37:13.917 --> 00:37:16.537
oxidized form,
which is F two,

00:37:16.537 --> 00:37:20.248
is strongly oxidizing.
It has a big positive number.

00:37:20.248 --> 00:37:22.723
It is at the very top of the
table.

00:37:22.723 --> 00:37:25.997
A big positive number.
It likes to be reduced,

00:37:25.997 --> 00:37:30.000
i.e., it likes to oxidize other
things.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.943
Now let's go to the bottom of
the table and see what we can

00:37:34.943 --> 00:37:39.119
say about this lithium plus,
lithium solid couple.

00:37:39.119 --> 00:37:43.892
That had a
large negative value for the

00:37:43.892 --> 00:37:48.750
standard reduction potential,
and that means it is hard to

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:50.965
reduce.
Let's look at that.

00:37:50.965 --> 00:37:54.630
We have lithium plus one,
plus one electron,

00:37:54.630 --> 00:38:00.000
going to lithium solid.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.708
And that reduction is listed
with a standard reduction

00:38:03.708 --> 00:38:07.557
potential of minus 3.045 volts.
That is a large negative

00:38:07.557 --> 00:38:09.796
number.
If it is a large negative

00:38:09.796 --> 00:38:13.015
number, that means it is hard to
add electrons.

00:38:13.015 --> 00:38:16.094
This direction,
as written, is not particular

00:38:16.094 --> 00:38:18.963
favorable.
Lithium plus one does

00:38:18.963 --> 00:38:21.902
not want to go to lithium 
solid.

00:38:21.902 --> 00:38:24.072
It is hard to add that
electron.

00:38:24.072 --> 00:38:27.781
That direction of the reaction,
the forward direction,

00:38:27.781 --> 00:38:33.392
would not be very favorable.
Delta G would be positive.

00:38:33.392 --> 00:38:38.730
It would be a large positive
number, so it does not want to

00:38:38.730 --> 00:38:43.515
go in that direction.
Is lithium plus one a

00:38:43.515 --> 00:38:45.723
good oxidizing agent?
No.

00:38:45.723 --> 00:38:48.576
But it is a good reducing
agent.

00:38:48.576 --> 00:38:53.453
Or, lithium solid is
a good reducing agent.

00:38:53.453 --> 00:38:57.503
Lithium solid likes to reduce
other elements.

00:38:57.503 --> 00:39:03.379
It likes to get oxidized.
This reaction is favorable in

00:39:03.379 --> 00:39:07.482
the reverse direction.
The lithium solid

00:39:07.482 --> 00:39:12.569
over here would be very happy to
be lithium plus one.

00:39:12.569 --> 00:39:15.687
Lithium solid is a good
reducing agent.

00:39:15.687 --> 00:39:20.035
If we look again at this
couple, the lithium plus one,

00:39:20.035 --> 00:39:25.041
lithium couple
with the large negative standard

00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:28.651
reduction potential,
we find that the reduced

00:39:28.651 --> 00:39:33.000
species here,
lithium solid --

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.846
--The reduced species is very
reducing, so it wants to be

00:39:37.846 --> 00:39:41.307
oxidized itself.
It wants to reduce other

00:39:41.307 --> 00:39:44.336
things.
It is a good reducing agent.

00:39:44.336 --> 00:39:49.615
If we go back to our table down
here, it says the reduced form

00:39:49.615 --> 00:39:53.942
is strongly reducing.
Up here, on the far corner on

00:39:53.942 --> 00:39:58.096
the left-hand side,
the oxidized form is strongly

00:39:58.096 --> 00:40:01.974
oxidizing.
Down here, on the right-hand

00:40:01.974 --> 00:40:05.006
side, the reduced form is
strongly reducing.

00:40:05.006 --> 00:40:08.461
You will be asked about various
things in between.

00:40:08.461 --> 00:40:12.480
Is something a better oxidizing
agent than something else?

00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:16.429
Is something a better reducing
agent than something else?

00:40:16.429 --> 00:40:20.166
And if you remember these
parts, oxidized form up here

00:40:20.166 --> 00:40:23.903
where standard reduction
potential E knot is positive,

00:40:23.903 --> 00:40:26.371
oxidized form is strongly
oxidizing.

00:40:26.371 --> 00:40:29.403
Down here, where you have a
negative number,

00:40:29.403 --> 00:40:33.000
reduced form is strongly
reducing.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.430
This makes sense from what you
have learned before,

00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:39.105
actually.
And this is another table from

00:40:39.105 --> 00:40:42.124
your book, so I didn't put it in
the handout.

00:40:42.124 --> 00:40:44.456
We talked about fluorine over
here.

00:40:44.456 --> 00:40:48.160
We talked about lithium.
This has a big positive number

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:52.139
over here so it is easy to
reduce, these are good oxidizing

00:40:52.139 --> 00:40:54.129
agents.
And on the other side,

00:40:54.129 --> 00:40:59.000
these want to be oxidized.
They are good reducing agents.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.558
Fluorine minus has a
noble gas configuration,

00:41:02.558 --> 00:41:06.322
and lithium plus has a
noble gas configuration,

00:41:06.322 --> 00:41:10.222
so it makes sense from some of
the trends you talked about

00:41:10.222 --> 00:41:14.123
earlier in terms of whether
something is favorable or not.

00:41:14.123 --> 00:41:18.229
Whether it likes to be in the
plus one state or prefers to be

00:41:18.229 --> 00:41:22.130
in the minus one state can all
come out of these reduction

00:41:22.130 --> 00:41:25.278
potential numbers.
And you can figure out which

00:41:25.278 --> 00:41:30.000
direction is favorable,
the reduction or the oxidation.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.326
Let's take a look at an example
here of this cell potential and

00:41:36.326 --> 00:41:41.938
think about what are good
oxidizing agents and reduction

00:41:41.938 --> 00:41:45.408
agents.
There are these two couples

00:41:45.408 --> 00:41:48.775
over here we are going to look
up.

00:41:48.775 --> 00:41:54.285
And that is hard to see so I
will just go back to this.

00:41:54.285 --> 00:42:00.000
What is happening in this
particular reaction?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:08.069
We have two irons plus three
and two electrons going to two

00:42:08.069 --> 00:42:14.330
iron plus two.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:19.199
Is this a reduction or an
oxidation?

00:42:19.199 --> 00:42:27.547
As written, it is a reduction.
That means it would take place

00:42:27.547 --> 00:42:33.721
at the anode or cathode?
At the cathode.

00:42:33.721 --> 00:42:38.196
All right.
The other reaction we have is

00:42:38.196 --> 00:42:44.049
two I minus going to I two solid
plus two electrons,

00:42:44.049 --> 00:42:49.901
because it needs to be
balanced, so this would be an

00:42:49.901 --> 00:42:54.262
oxidation.

00:42:54.262 --> 00:43:00.000
And so it should take place at
the anode.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.804
Now we can calculate the cell
potential for this particular

00:43:06.804 --> 00:43:11.614
reaction, the delta E nought for
the cell.

00:43:11.614 --> 00:43:18.770
And that will equal the delta E
for the cathode reaction minus

00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:22.759
the delta E for the anode
reaction.

00:43:22.759 --> 00:43:29.212
The delta E for the cathode
reaction, and you were given

00:43:29.212 --> 00:43:35.195
this in your handouts,
we have +770 volts minus +535

00:43:35.195 --> 00:43:42.000
volts for the reaction happening
at the anode.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.163
And so that will equal 0.235
volts.

00:43:46.163 --> 00:43:49.959
And so will that be
spontaneous?

00:43:49.959 --> 00:43:55.836
Yes, it will be spontaneous.
Delta E is positive,

00:43:55.836 --> 00:44:04.105
so delta G will be negative.
We will have a spontaneous

00:44:04.105 --> 00:44:10.105
reaction.
Now, let's consider which are

00:44:10.105 --> 00:44:16.421
the better oxidizing and
reducing agents.

00:44:16.421 --> 00:44:25.578
For better oxidizing agent,
is it iron plus three

00:44:25.578 --> 00:44:32.625
or iodide two?
Which is a better oxidizing

00:44:32.625 --> 00:44:35.930
agent?
We can go back to the chart.

00:44:35.930 --> 00:44:40.111
Here is the iron,
and below it is the iodide

00:44:40.111 --> 00:44:42.541
reaction.
Which is better?

00:44:42.541 --> 00:44:48.083
I think I heard some people say
iron plus three.

00:44:48.083 --> 00:44:51.875
That should be a better
oxidizing agent.

00:44:51.875 --> 00:44:57.222
Again, if you look at where
they are, the things on this

00:44:57.222 --> 00:45:02.958
side at the top are the most
oxidizing or the best oxidizing

00:45:02.958 --> 00:45:07.317
agent.
Iron plus three is

00:45:07.317 --> 00:45:09.884
there.
It is going to be better.

00:45:09.884 --> 00:45:14.768
And we can also think about
this in terms of the spontaneous

00:45:14.768 --> 00:45:17.748
reaction.
This is spontaneous and the

00:45:17.748 --> 00:45:21.639
iron plus three here
is being reduced,

00:45:21.639 --> 00:45:26.854
so it is acting as an oxidizing
reagent, and that is causing the

00:45:26.854 --> 00:45:33.060
reaction to be spontaneous.
And if we talk about the better

00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:37.601
reducing agent,
the reducing agent is the thing

00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:42.834
that wants to get oxidized.
And if we consider I minus

00:45:42.834 --> 00:45:47.770
or iron plus two
which is better?

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:51.423
I minus is going to be
better.

00:45:51.423 --> 00:45:56.656
Again, it is down here.
Down here, we have the reduced

00:45:56.656 --> 00:46:01.000
forms that are strongly
reducing.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:06.534
This is the reduced form.
It is on this end of the table.

00:46:06.534 --> 00:46:12.266
Also, that is the reaction that
is happening here and it is

00:46:12.266 --> 00:46:16.318
spontaneous.
And if you talk about the two

00:46:16.318 --> 00:46:20.765
reduction potentials,
you can figure that out.

00:46:20.765 --> 00:46:22.498
Okay.
See you on Wednesday.
