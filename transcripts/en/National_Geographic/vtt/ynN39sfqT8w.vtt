00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.467
[explosion]

00:00:07.934 --> 00:00:09.667
MARY ANNE HITT: To me as
somebody who had grown up

00:00:09.667 --> 00:00:12.100
in the mountains and
love the mountains,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.867
the idea that a coal
company had the right

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:19.266
to blow up an entire mountain
and wipe it off the map forever

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.266
was just unconscionable.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.734
These places are
not just sort of

00:00:23.734 --> 00:00:26.967
physically important to people,
but they are spiritually

00:00:26.967 --> 00:00:28.300
important to people.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.333
And once they're gone,
they're gone forever.

00:00:31.333 --> 00:00:33.333
You can't put a
mountain back together.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:40.867
And I just deeply feel that
no company has the right

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:44.400
to take away something
that ultimately belongs

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.767
and matters to so many people.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:00:57.533
Just look across the valley.

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.633
Next door, that's what
it used to be like--

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:03.734
one of the most diverse forests
on the planet, and now it's

00:01:03.734 --> 00:01:06.266
a wasteland.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.734
Over there used to be
a valley and a stream

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:13.767
that's now covered up with
thousands of feet of boulders.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:15.834
That's never going
to be the same again.

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:18.633
And over 2000 miles of
streams have been buried

00:01:18.633 --> 00:01:20.300
in Appalachia-- some
of the most diverse

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.133
streams on the planet,
some of the cleanest water

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:23.533
on the planet.

00:01:23.533 --> 00:01:29.467
And that is a huge loss
to this part of the world.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:31.200
MARGARET PALMER: When that
rock material is pushed

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.633
over the edge of the
now flattened mountain,

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:36.800
it ends up dissolving
a lot of minerals

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.300
into the water, things like
iron, magnesium, calcium.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.133
And organisms can't
tolerate that,

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.400
so it kills organisms
in the stream.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.567
And so that material, that water
that is now heavily polluted

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:49.767
runs out of the base
of the valley fill,

00:01:49.767 --> 00:01:52.900
into streams, and eventually
into rivers below.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.400
MARY ANNE HITT: They also
store the mining waste

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.266
in these huge earthen dams, and
they're holding back billions

00:01:59.266 --> 00:02:01.300
of gallons of toxic
sludge that's leaking

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.834
into the drinking water.

00:02:03.834 --> 00:02:07.166
REGINA LILLY: Everybody's well
is pretty much contaminated

00:02:07.166 --> 00:02:09.400
in one form or another.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.367
So I don't use water to cook.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:13.800
I use it to do the dishes, but
that's about it, because you

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.967
can wipe the water off.

00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:21.266
There's a guy that we tend to
help out every now and again.

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.266
Here's is blind from the water.

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:25.667
He could take his water,
turn his water on, put it

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:28.133
in a clear water bottle,
put his hand over it,

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.433
sit for a few seconds,
even put a cap on it,

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:32.900
take the cap off, and take
a lighter and light it,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.367
and water will burn.

00:02:34.367 --> 00:02:35.367
So yeah, water around
here is pretty bad.
