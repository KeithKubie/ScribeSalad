the things I learned about resilience -

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859
the things I learned about resilience -
 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.410
the things I learned about resilience -
my time in prison is that human beings I

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420
my time in prison is that human beings I
 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.150
my time in prison is that human beings I
believe by nature are very resilient and

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160
believe by nature are very resilient and
 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.220
believe by nature are very resilient and
oftentimes we don't recognize our own

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
oftentimes we don't recognize our own
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.830
oftentimes we don't recognize our own
resiliency until we're faced with

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840
resiliency until we're faced with
 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.120
resiliency until we're faced with
obstacles and circumstances that

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130
obstacles and circumstances that
 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.720

challenges us and pushes us and it looks
different for everybody you know when I

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650
different for everybody you know when I
 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.610
different for everybody you know when I
think about my journey through in prison

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620
think about my journey through in prison
 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.490
think about my journey through in prison
you know I went through some very

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500
you know I went through some very
 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.340
you know I went through some very
adverse experiences I had some

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
adverse experiences I had some
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.549
adverse experiences I had some
significant obstacles to overcome

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559
significant obstacles to overcome
 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.960
significant obstacles to overcome
including you know long-term solitary

confinement which they estimate is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
confinement which they estimate is
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.360
confinement which they estimate is
designed to drive a person crazy after

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370
designed to drive a person crazy after
 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.270
designed to drive a person crazy after
90 days and what I found in that

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280
90 days and what I found in that
 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760
90 days and what I found in that
environment is that people figure out

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770
environment is that people figure out
 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.270
environment is that people figure out
ways to cope and to survive and to get

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280
ways to cope and to survive and to get
 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.790
ways to cope and to survive and to get
through when they're forced to do so and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
through when they're forced to do so and
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.870
through when they're forced to do so and
for me I found that I was very

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880
for me I found that I was very
 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.550
for me I found that I was very
resourceful when my back was against the

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560
resourceful when my back was against the
 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.250
resourceful when my back was against the
wall and that resilience was also a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260
wall and that resilience was also a
 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.590
wall and that resilience was also a
choice you know I had a choice in

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600
choice you know I had a choice in
 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.120
choice you know I had a choice in
whether to give up I had two choice in

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
whether to give up I had two choice in
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.620
whether to give up I had two choice in
whether to fight for a second chance and

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630
whether to fight for a second chance and
 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.810
whether to fight for a second chance and
you know that type of resilience was

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
you know that type of resilience was
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.850
you know that type of resilience was
inspired by other people you know I read

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860
inspired by other people you know I read
 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.190
inspired by other people you know I read
Nelson Mandela's autobiography you know

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200
Nelson Mandela's autobiography you know
 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.590
Nelson Mandela's autobiography you know
I read the poem Invictus I've read you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
I read the poem Invictus I've read you
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990
I read the poem Invictus I've read you
know Malcolm X's autobiography no I

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000
know Malcolm X's autobiography no I
 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.710
know Malcolm X's autobiography no I
loved autobiographies but what I learned

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720
loved autobiographies but what I learned
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.490
loved autobiographies but what I learned
through reading is that if you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500
through reading is that if you
 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.010
through reading is that if you
acknowledge what you're going through

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020
acknowledge what you're going through
 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.480
acknowledge what you're going through
and you recognize that it is the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
and you recognize that it is the
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.050
and you recognize that it is the
obstacle and that it's that dark moment

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060
obstacle and that it's that dark moment
 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.999
obstacle and that it's that dark moment
but you also realized there's light on

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009
but you also realized there's light on
 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.190
but you also realized there's light on
the other side of that tunnel then you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
the other side of that tunnel then you
 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.850
the other side of that tunnel then you
can get through and to me I think hope

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860
can get through and to me I think hope
 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.260
can get through and to me I think hope
it's probably the cornerstone of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270
it's probably the cornerstone of
 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.319
it's probably the cornerstone of
resilience as long as you have hope you

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329
resilience as long as you have hope you
 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.580
resilience as long as you have hope you
can come out on the other side of

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590
can come out on the other side of
 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.880
can come out on the other side of
anything once you dim the light of hope

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
anything once you dim the light of hope
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.450
anything once you dim the light of hope
there's no possibility of you coming out

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460
there's no possibility of you coming out
 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.789
there's no possibility of you coming out
on the other side and to me I think

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799
on the other side and to me I think
 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.669
on the other side and to me I think
that's what resiliency is you know I

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679
that's what resiliency is you know I
 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.640
that's what resiliency is you know I
always looked at if I focus on the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
always looked at if I focus on the
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.280
always looked at if I focus on the
purpose instead of the pain then I can

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
purpose instead of the pain then I can
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.730
purpose instead of the pain then I can
get through

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740
get through
 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.060
get through
the other side and that's how I live my

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070
the other side and that's how I live my
 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.370
the other side and that's how I live my
life and to me you know those things and

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380
life and to me you know those things and
 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.590
life and to me you know those things and
body what resilience really is three of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600
body what resilience really is three of
 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.680
body what resilience really is three of
the ingredients toward being resilient

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
the ingredients toward being resilient
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.880
the ingredients toward being resilient
is you have to be optimistic optimism is

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890
is you have to be optimistic optimism is
 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.640
is you have to be optimistic optimism is
such an integral part of getting through

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650
such an integral part of getting through
 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.290
such an integral part of getting through
adversity I would say a second thing is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300
adversity I would say a second thing is
 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.100
adversity I would say a second thing is
really being resourceful and figuring

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110
really being resourceful and figuring
 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.660
really being resourceful and figuring
out in your environment what are things

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670
out in your environment what are things
 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.750
out in your environment what are things
people or you know inspiring you know

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760
people or you know inspiring you know
 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.470
people or you know inspiring you know
components that you can utilize to help

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480
components that you can utilize to help
 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.570
components that you can utilize to help
you cope with whatever it is you're

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580
you cope with whatever it is you're
 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.930
you cope with whatever it is you're
going through and then I think the third

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940
going through and then I think the third
 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.100
going through and then I think the third
thing would would be you have to have

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110
thing would would be you have to have
 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.290
thing would would be you have to have
memory loss know that probably sounds

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300
memory loss know that probably sounds
 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.440
memory loss know that probably sounds
crazy right but what I found is that a

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450
crazy right but what I found is that a
 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.560
crazy right but what I found is that a
lot of times we replay memories that no

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570
lot of times we replay memories that no
 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.710
lot of times we replay memories that no
longer exist over and over in our head

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720
longer exist over and over in our head
 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.680
longer exist over and over in our head
and what that does is it holds you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690
and what that does is it holds you
 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.400
and what that does is it holds you
hostage and so once you begin to release

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
hostage and so once you begin to release
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.680
hostage and so once you begin to release
those memories and recognize that you

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690
those memories and recognize that you
 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.240
those memories and recognize that you
can never reclaim that space or that

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250
can never reclaim that space or that
 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.470
can never reclaim that space or that
time or that experience then you can

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480
time or that experience then you can
 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.170
time or that experience then you can
move forward in life you know because

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
move forward in life you know because
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.240
move forward in life you know because
now you've taken the seconds off your

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250
now you've taken the seconds off your
 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.060
now you've taken the seconds off your
feet and you're a lot more mobile and I

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070
feet and you're a lot more mobile and I
 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.850
feet and you're a lot more mobile and I
think in order to be resilient you have

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860
think in order to be resilient you have
 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.980
think in order to be resilient you have
to not be thinking about what happened

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990
to not be thinking about what happened
 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.620
to not be thinking about what happened
in the past and you really just have to

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630
in the past and you really just have to
 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.990
in the past and you really just have to
be focused on what you need to do to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000
be focused on what you need to do to
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.490
be focused on what you need to do to
move forward

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
move forward
 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.750
move forward
