00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:03.940
Our final look at what is the disease concerns,

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.100
how diseases have changed over time.

3
00:00:06.101 --> 00:00:10.810
The diseases encountered by our ancestors are not the diseases that we encounter

4
00:00:10.811 --> 00:00:11.644
today.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:12.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.820
<v 0>Monogenic and a stochastic developmental diseases,
however,</v>

7
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:20.020
are nearly independent of the environment and so their frequency was probably

8
00:00:20.021 --> 00:00:21.010
the same for the Greeks,

9
00:00:21.011 --> 00:00:25.210
the Romans and the Han Chinese as it is for us today.

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.741
However,

11
00:00:26.741 --> 00:00:31.270
environmental diseases are often caused now by mismatches between biology and

12
00:00:31.271 --> 00:00:33.010
culture,
and that's a new development

13
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.790
we defined disease prevalence is the fraction of the population that is

14
00:00:39.791 --> 00:00:40.624
afflicted.

15
00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.990
We defined disease incidence is the number of new cases per unit time and both

16
00:00:47.261 --> 00:00:50.740
prevalence and incidents very widely in space and time.

17
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.130
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

18
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.800
<v 0>diseases may occur in clusters for simple reasons,</v>

19
00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:59.540
including poor nutrition or medical care and other cases.

20
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:03.440
The positive or negative correlation of diseases can have biological reasons

21
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.680
reflecting their genetic and physiological tradeoffs that are causing

22
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.670
vulnerabilities.

23
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.130
Monogenic and stochastic developmental diseases are important,

24
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.880
but there incidents is independent of the environment except for mutagenic

25
00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:23.750
activity.
So exposure to ultraviolet light,

26
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:27.530
radioactivity and chemical mutagens can alter their incidents,

27
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.260
but if those are held constant,

28
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.310
then these are occurring at a fairly steady background rate.

29
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.850
The rare mutations that caused them are basically set by the rate at which DNA

30
00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:48.430
gets repaired and buy these sort of background exposures.

31
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:50.740
Things like cosmic ray incidents.

32
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.140
<v 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.250
<v 0>Their prevalence,
however,
is increasing his medical care improves.</v>

34
00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:58.000
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.720
<v 0>That will eventually increase the frequencies in the population of some of the</v>

36
00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:04.030
mutations that caused them.
However,

37
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:07.000
it is unlikely that they will ever become very frequent.

38
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.140
Environmental changes are causing much bigger changes in the nature of disease.

39
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:17.340
<v 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.150
<v 0>The major environmental changes in our history include our exit from Africa,</v>

41
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.030
which exposed us to lower temperatures and new pathogens.

42
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.200
The agricultural revolution,
which brought with it a new diet,

43
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.530
urbanization and diseases that we acquired from domestic animals and the

44
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:38.340
industrial revolution,
which brought with it hygiene,
clean water,
electricity,

45
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.360
artificial light,
processed food and pharmaceuticals,

46
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.190
the form of antibiotics,
vaccines,
statins,
histamine blockers,

47
00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.020
Nsa ids and so forth.

48
00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.130
So we have recently experienced major environmental change on a number of

49
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.343
timescales.

50
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.130
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.040
<v 0>no,
that mismatch.</v>

52
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.770
<v 1>And the outcome of mismatch depends on trade offs.</v>

53
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.060
Some new diseases emerge directly from novel toxins or pathogens such as dioxin

54
00:03:09.131 --> 00:03:10.900
poisoning or HIV.

55
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.880
Now they can be eliminated by removing the toxin or if possible,

56
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:17.080
developing a vaccine.

57
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.420
Others become more prevalent when environmental change shifts the cost benefit

58
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:27.421
relationship in a trade off that had been optimized to a prior environment.

59
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.311
For example,

60
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.300
immune responses that were selected in past epidemics may increase the risk of

61
00:03:34.301 --> 00:03:38.770
autoimmune diseases.
Allergies and asthma.
Yeah.

62
00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.400
<v 0>Changes in the cost benefit.</v>

63
00:03:40.401 --> 00:03:43.760
Balance of trade offs are also responsible for many of the diseases.

64
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.790
Diseases of homeostasis such as type two diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

65
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.420
Environmental change is also shifting our demographics with very far reaching

66
00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.494
consequences.

67
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160
Modernity has brought a dramatic decline in extrinsic mortality had previously

68
00:04:05.771 --> 00:04:08.800
been caused by childhood infections and starvation.

69
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.140
The resulting extension of lifespan has exposed many age related chronic

70
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:19.260
diseases that were previously rare but are now increasingly common.

71
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

72
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.590
<v 0>These diseases include cancer,</v>

73
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.400
neurodegeneration diseases have failed defenses,

74
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.960
all of which are associated with age related declines in maintenance programs.

75
00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.870
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.760
<v 0>If these diseases are conquered,
new ones will emerge.
As the process continues,</v>

77
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.200
how much average human life will be extended and how much will be will be

78
00:04:42.201 --> 00:04:45.050
improved is at this point,
unclear.

79
00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.720
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.553
<v 0>To summarize,</v>

81
00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.940
the prevalence and the incidence of types of disease has been changing

82
00:04:51.941 --> 00:04:53.890
dramatically,
especially recently.

83
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.960
Genetic and stochastic developmental diseases are relatively unaffected by

84
00:04:58.961 --> 00:05:00.040
environmental change.

85
00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.200
Environmental Change does cause most shifts in human disease patterns either

86
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:09.280
directly when environmental toxins or obesogenic diets are emerging.

87
00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:14.281
Pathogens encounter us or indirectly through disruptions of tradeoff

88
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.610
equilibrium,
so that would elicit diseases of defenses,

89
00:05:18.611 --> 00:05:21.610
homeostasis and have reduced maintenance.

90
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.680
The overall picture is that dramatic.

91
00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:31.681
Recent environmental change is exposing vulnerabilities and trade offs in our

92
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:38.770
biology.
That evolution has not yet had time to fix.
