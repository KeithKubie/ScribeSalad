00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:02.980
- [Voiceover] As a teacher
thinking about using a tool

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.953
inside or outside of your classroom,

00:00:04.953 --> 00:00:06.788
the first natural question is,

00:00:06.788 --> 00:00:09.329
well does that tool work?

00:00:09.329 --> 00:00:11.110
And that's also very important to us

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.479
here at Khan Academy with our mission.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:15.313
We don't want just people to use it.

00:00:15.313 --> 00:00:17.635
We want to feel good that that usage

00:00:17.635 --> 00:00:20.094
is actually driving real learning.

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:24.064
And so what I'm going to give
an overview of in this video,

00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:28.499
is a very large study conducted
in the state of Idaho.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:30.682
It was across the entire state,

00:00:30.682 --> 00:00:34.849
understanding whether Khan
Academy is driving real learning.

00:00:35.744 --> 00:00:38.623
And this is the largest
study that has ever been done

00:00:38.623 --> 00:00:41.479
on a personalized learning tool.

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:43.035
And so I'm going to summarize this.

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:44.939
We'll also give a link to the study,

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:47.307
later on in this tutorial.

00:00:47.307 --> 00:00:49.769
It was done and funded in conjunction with

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.856
the J.A. and Kathryn
Albertson Family Foundation.

00:00:53.856 --> 00:00:57.269
And so I'm just going to
summarize the report here.

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.498
So just as a big picture,

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:00.891
we'll go right down here.

00:01:00.891 --> 00:01:02.726
There's a lot of really
cool stories from teachers

00:01:02.726 --> 00:01:05.860
and educators and district officials here

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.298
talking about how they
implemented the pilot.

00:01:08.298 --> 00:01:09.599
But the big picture,

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:13.599
this was 47 schools, 33
districts, 173 teachers,

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:18.735
several thousand students
throughout the state of Idaho.

00:01:20.442 --> 00:01:21.998
And what they did in the study,

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:25.272
is the students took the NWEA map exam

00:01:25.272 --> 00:01:26.990
at the beginning of the year.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.755
They worked on Khan Academy,

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:33.027
and then they took the NWEA map
exam at the end of the year,

00:01:33.027 --> 00:01:35.280
and the way that efficacy was measured

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.136
is well the map exam
can see for any student,

00:01:38.136 --> 00:01:40.504
whether they are a student
who is more advanced

00:01:40.504 --> 00:01:41.990
or a student who is re-mediating,

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.685
they can see what their expected growth

00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:45.636
is in a traditional model

00:01:45.636 --> 00:01:47.586
and then they can compare
that expected growth

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:51.905
to what the actual growth
was using Khan Academy.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:53.647
And so let's just cut to the chase

00:01:53.647 --> 00:01:54.854
and see what the results are.

00:01:54.854 --> 00:01:57.942
There's a lot of videos that
we have on our educator portal

00:01:57.942 --> 00:02:01.100
that talks about how
the different teachers

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.119
use Khan Academy and
what they found valuable.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.069
But I'll go straight to the data here

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:08.577
for the sake of this video.

00:02:08.577 --> 00:02:10.040
And so if we go down here,

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.221
this is just the distribution
of students by grade level.

00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:16.332
You can see kind of late
elementary and middle schools

00:02:16.332 --> 00:02:18.306
were the bulk of the
students in the study were.

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:19.235
But even in third grade,

00:02:19.235 --> 00:02:21.069
we're talking about over 200 students.

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.986
So this is a very large scale study

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:27.594
and this first one says mission completion

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:29.591
versus spring percentile.

00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:30.543
Mission completion,

00:02:30.543 --> 00:02:33.956
these are the grade level
personalized learning experiences

00:02:33.956 --> 00:02:35.117
that the students can pick.

00:02:35.117 --> 00:02:36.534
So there is a third grade mission.

00:02:36.534 --> 00:02:38.600
There's actually an
early learning mission.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.761
There's a third, fourth, fifth,

00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:43.244
all the way up to Algebra,
Geometry, Trigonometry,

00:02:43.244 --> 00:02:44.916
there's even a calculus mission.

00:02:44.916 --> 00:02:48.167
And these are aligned to the
important state standards,

00:02:48.167 --> 00:02:49.862
especially the common core standards

00:02:49.862 --> 00:02:51.743
for K through pre-calculus.

00:02:51.743 --> 00:02:55.226
And they're aligned to the
AP standards for calculus.

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:57.269
And so what you see here is,

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.333
depending on how much a student
completed of their mission,

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:02.981
over the course of the pilot,

00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:05.420
it correlates very strongly with

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.441
how they performed on the map exam

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:09.529
during the spring assessment.

00:03:09.529 --> 00:03:11.666
Now you might say, well
of course, naturally,

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.105
a student who completes more,

00:03:13.105 --> 00:03:14.684
well that's maybe a student

00:03:14.684 --> 00:03:15.869
who's a little bit more advanced,

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.819
and so they're going to
be in a higher percentile.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:18.701
And I would agree with you.

00:03:18.701 --> 00:03:19.746
That makes sense.

00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:23.554
So this is, this right
here, is not evidence of,

00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:26.875
or clear evidence of efficacy just yet,

00:03:26.875 --> 00:03:28.477
but you definitely wanna see this trend.

00:03:28.477 --> 00:03:31.519
If for whatever reason
this was a flat line,

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.609
if it had a downward
slope for some reason,

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.745
then you would have an issue.

00:03:35.745 --> 00:03:37.231
But this is the direction
that you wanna see,

00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:38.392
but we wanna see more evidence.

00:03:38.392 --> 00:03:40.087
We wanna see for a given student,

00:03:40.087 --> 00:03:41.968
regardless of where they started,

00:03:41.968 --> 00:03:44.151
that usage of Khan Academy is not

00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:45.915
driving just expected learning.

00:03:45.915 --> 00:03:47.146
For all we know, this might be just

00:03:47.146 --> 00:03:49.398
what you would expect
for different students.

00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:53.717
It's driving learning above
and beyond the expectations.

00:03:53.717 --> 00:03:56.527
And so that's where we
see this data down here.

00:03:56.527 --> 00:03:57.850
And they boiled it out,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.870
students who completed zero to 10%

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.843
of their mission on
average, grew as expected.

00:04:02.843 --> 00:04:04.793
These students barely used Khan Academy.

00:04:04.793 --> 00:04:07.045
So once again, grew as expected,

00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:09.275
this means if you are an advanced student

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.364
and you are learning
at a fairly quick pace,

00:04:11.364 --> 00:04:14.360
well you grew as expected,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.589
you grew at that quick pace.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:19.375
And if you are a student who
took a little bit more time.

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.140
Well you also grew as expected

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.463
and so when you didn't use Khan Academy,

00:04:22.463 --> 00:04:25.111
just what you would expect happened.

00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:27.595
But then when you see students who

00:04:27.595 --> 00:04:29.290
had significant usage of Khan Academy,

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.426
students who completed 40% of more

00:04:31.426 --> 00:04:34.608
of their mission on
average grew 1.5 times more

00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.697
than their expected growth in one year.

00:04:36.697 --> 00:04:38.880
Students who completed 60%
or more of their mission

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.851
grew an average 1.8 times
their expected growth.

00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:47.018
So they almost had two
years of growth in one year.

00:04:47.982 --> 00:04:49.422
And once again, I want to be very clear,

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:53.114
this is, what we're plotting
on the vertical axis here.

00:04:53.114 --> 00:04:54.646
This isn't just growth,

00:04:54.646 --> 00:04:59.406
this is average actual growth
divided by target growth.

00:04:59.406 --> 00:05:01.241
So in a normal model,

00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:03.958
if you just look at the map
data on a nationwide basis,

00:05:03.958 --> 00:05:06.047
whether a student is strong or weak,

00:05:06.047 --> 00:05:08.548
if Khan Academy had no effect

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:12.654
you would expect just a
flat line right over here.

00:05:12.654 --> 00:05:17.246
You would expect everything
here to be just at one.

00:05:17.246 --> 00:05:19.359
If Khan Academy was
actually less effective

00:05:19.359 --> 00:05:21.379
than whatever students were doing before,

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:22.912
then you would say well these students

00:05:22.912 --> 00:05:24.792
who are spending a lot
of time on Khan Academy,

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:26.254
then it would be taking away from those,

00:05:26.254 --> 00:05:27.834
so you would see a downward slope.

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:29.552
But over here we see that the students

00:05:29.552 --> 00:05:32.826
who are actually using
Khan Academy deeply,

00:05:32.826 --> 00:05:35.195
and you can imagine any
large scale studies like this

00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:37.610
you have variation, and
the various fidelity

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.467
to which folks are using Khan Academy,

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.394
how integrated it is in the classroom.

00:05:41.394 --> 00:05:44.390
But the classrooms that
are using it more deeply,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:47.687
more regularly, are not
just seeing expected growth,

00:05:47.687 --> 00:05:49.770
they're seeing 1.8 times.

00:05:51.031 --> 00:05:53.562
They're seeing a significant multiple

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.557
of what you would expect
their growth to be.

00:05:56.557 --> 00:05:59.227
So this is nearly two years of growth

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:01.644
in one year of learning time.

00:06:02.641 --> 00:06:05.404
And that's once again, this is 60% plus,

00:06:05.404 --> 00:06:07.378
so you could only imagine what it would be

00:06:07.378 --> 00:06:10.675
if students complete 70%,
80%, 90% of the mission

00:06:10.675 --> 00:06:14.195
or if it's used in an even deeper way

00:06:14.195 --> 00:06:16.195
in different classrooms.
