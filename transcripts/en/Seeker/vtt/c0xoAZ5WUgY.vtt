00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.890
Many of you can probably relate to being annoyed
at the sound of someone tapping their foot

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.009
incessantly, breathing really loudly, or clicking
pens.

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.660
But for some people it’s more than an annoyance,
certain sounds cause serious distress.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.279
This was the case for three patients who were
referred to the Academic Medical Center in

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.879
Amsterdam in 2009 for what their doctors thought
could be obsessive compulsive disorder.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.820
But after interviews and assessments, the
specialists at the medical center realized

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
that the symptoms they were presenting like
extreme anger at certain sounds and impulsively

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.329
trying to stop them,were not diagnosable.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.039
They did not fit any of the criteria in either
the DSM or the International Statistical Classification

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.739
of Diseases handbooks.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.019
As you probably know, these are like bibles
for the medical community - if something is

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.530
not listed there, medically speaking, it’s
like it doesn’t exist.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.770
But clearly, based on these three patients,
something was going on.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.250
So researchers at the Academic Medical Center
(AMC) decided to take a deeper dive into what

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000
seemed to them, like a potentially new sound
disorder.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.450
Now, back in 2001 two researchers at Emory
coined the term misophonia, which means ‘hatred

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.450
of sound.”

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.480
They noted abnormally strong physical and
psychological reactions to sound that were

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480
completely involuntary.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.850
And theorized that these may be stemming from
enhanced connections between the brain and

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.110
auditory system.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.510
So, the idea was already out there, but more
research was needed.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.540
So the researchers at the AMC set out determine
if it could be classified as an actual disorder.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.140
For their study, the researchers recruited
42 Dutch participants who reported having

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.500
sound aversions.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.770
They then conducted multiple interviews and
assessments, including using a modified version

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.850
of the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale,
which they called the Amsterdam Misophonia

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:55.850
Scale.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.570
This asked participants to rate things like
how much time they spent thinking about or

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.610
acting on their misophonia, how sound affected
their social lives, how much anger they felt

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.890
when they heard certain sounds, and how much
they struggled with controlling impulses to

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.030
stop sounds.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.940
In 2013 they published their results in the
peer reviewed journal PLOS One.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.659
They found that all participants were bothered
by sounds produced by humans, not animals,

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.670
or cars or anything else.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.730
And for the vast majority of participants,
81%, sounds that had to do with eating were

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.860
terrible.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.879
About 60% mentioned being stressed out by
clicking or typing.

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:34.500
What’s more, five patients were also triggered
by repetitive movement - such as rocking feet

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.700
back and forth.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.160
Many of you, myself included, can probably
relate and find some of these things super

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.160
annoying.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.560
But unlike most of us, these patients weren’t
just annoyed.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.999
They were deeply upset - they immediately
experienced a physical aversive reaction like

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:51.879
irritation and disgust that turned into anger.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.610
In fact, more than a quarter of patients reported
occasionally getting aggresive and more than

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.840
10% even admitted to hitting an ex partner
once.

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.999
For people with misophonia, certain sound
cause so much daily suffering that they attempt

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:07.480
to avoid them at all costs.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.629
The problem is that these sounds are everywhere,
so they end up isolating themselves.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.040
And, this negatively affects their work, school,
and social activities - preventing them from

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.579
leading normal lives.

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.730
This is why some medical professionals, like
the researchers in this study, are advocating

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.540
to classify the most extreme cases of these
annoyances as a discrete psychiatric condition.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.040
Classifying it would facilitate treatment
and research.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.969
Which is important, because research is currently
scarce.

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:36.340
Scientists think it is caused by something
in the central nervous system - that it has

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.370
to do with perception in the brain and not
actual problems with the ears.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.580
But without additional funding and research
it’s tough to know for sure... and consequently,

00:03:44.580 --> 00:04:16.489
tough to help those who may 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.829
be suffering.
