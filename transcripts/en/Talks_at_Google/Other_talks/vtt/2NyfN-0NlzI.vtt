00:00:07.932 --> 00:00:09.140
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.770
And welcome to Authors
in Google in Cambridge.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.120
Today, it's my
very great pleasure

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.560
to introduce Stephen Kinzer.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.680
We'll be discussing his
newest book, "The Brothers.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.060
John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles
and their Secret World War."

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.520
Stephen Kinzer is an
award-winning foreign

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.020
correspondent who
has unflinchingly

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.260
covered more than 50
countries on five continents

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.740
for newspapers including
the "Boston Globe"

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.905
and the "New York Times,"
over a career that

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:43.210
has spanned more
than four decades,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.670
during which time many
people in positions of power,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.820
I'm guessing, have
wished he had chosen

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.060
a different line of work.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.270
He currently teaches journalism
and international relations

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.230
at Boston University,
contributes articles

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.430
to the "New York Review of
Books" and the "Daily Beast"

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.560
and writes a world affairs
column for the "Guardian."

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.880
"The Brothers" is his ninth
book on international affairs.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.440
The story of the Dulles
brothers is a story

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.690
of the creation of the US
intelligence community,

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.170
of the beginning of US covert
actions around the world,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.490
and of the overthrow of
foreign governments in the name

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.060
of democracy and the interests
of the giant corporations

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.710
the brothers spent
their careers serving.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.360
"The Brothers" places
their extraordinary lives

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.850
against the background of
American culture and history

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.920
using the framework of biography
to ask why does the United

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.620
States behave as it
does in the world?

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.030
Please join me in
welcoming Stephen Kinzer.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.500
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.000
STEPHEN KINZER: OK,
thanks for that.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.250
It's wonderful to be here.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.330
I feel like I'm in some kind
of an inner sanctum at Google.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.770
I was told not to write anything
about this, which was not

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.330
asked of me when
I spoke recently

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.270
at the State Department.

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.932
Or when I spoke recently at
the National Security Agency.

00:02:14.932 --> 00:02:17.140
I'm glad to hear that this
is going to be on YouTube.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.030
But I have a feeling
that given where we are,

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.620
it's probably
going out right now

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.660
to a few places we
can't even imagine.

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.150
I should point out just
after that lush introduction

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.390
that I no longer teach
at Boston University.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.812
I'm now a Fellow at
the Watson Institute

00:02:32.812 --> 00:02:34.270
for International
Studies at Brown.

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.597
Also, I'm trying to
focus on, in my teaching

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:42.680
and writing, some of the
same issues that come out

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.700
in this book that we're
talking about today.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.580
Actually, the digitization
of the book-selling industry

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.550
has had a cute
little effect for me

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.600
as I've been speaking about this
current book, "The Brothers."

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.810
I've always had a
slight pang when

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.440
I've gone into bookstores
and look for my books.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.270
Not because I don't
find them, I actually

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.610
have graduated from that.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.650
That's more of a pang.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.880
That's really a wince.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.460
But I go into the bookstore,
and I usually find my books

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.430
in some section like Current
History or Modern American

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.250
Politics or something like that.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.072
And those books are then
organized alphabetically.

00:03:25.072 --> 00:03:28.020
And what often happens to me,
as it just happened this week

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.610
when I stopped into
Barnes and Noble,

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.080
that my book, because
of my name being Kinzer,

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.670
is always next to a
book by Henry Kissinger.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.550
I've never really liked that.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.730
But it's simply
seems to be my fate.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.230
I did not, however, account
on a wonderful change

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.300
that has happened.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.950
I'm now noticing it
for the first time

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.260
with this book, "The Brothers."

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.220
So nowadays, of
course, many people

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.240
are buying their
books on Amazon.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.580
And Amazon alphabetizes their
books in a different way.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.280
First of all, there
are no categories.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.700
It's just from A to
Z. And it's by title.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.950
So when I look for
my book on Amazon,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.520
I type in "The Brothers,"
and it comes up.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:10.450
That's the first book.

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:15.200
And the very next book after
me is "The Brothers Karamazov."

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.250
So I'm going from Henry
Kissinger to Dostoevsky.

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.070
And I feel like I'm in much
more amenable company now.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:24.300
So if I don't achieve
anything else with this book,

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.560
I think I've already
accomplished something

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.190
thanks to the way that
book buying is changing.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.750
Now, it's been very interesting
for me learning about

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.790
and writing about and speaking
about the Dulles brothers,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.780
starting with the obvious fact.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.850
And that's this.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.960
In the 1950s, John Foster
Dulles was Secretary of State.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.470
His younger brother Allen
was Director of the CIA.

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.305
It was the only time in history
that brothers controlled

00:04:55.305 --> 00:05:00.900
the overt and the covert sides
of American foreign policy.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.550
They were hugely powerful.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.970
They could make and
break governments.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.310
And they did.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.290
Possibly, there was hardly a
literate human being on Earth

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.720
who did not know
the name Dulles.

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.630
But now, they're almost
completely forgotten.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.490
We've essentially airbrushed
them out of history.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.520
I used to hate the idea
that airport in Washington

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.370
was named after
John Foster Dulles.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.780
But now I'm grateful,
because without that, we

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:32.862
wouldn't remember
his name at all.

00:05:32.862 --> 00:05:37.660
And I start out in my
book with a story that

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.880
talks about how I began
working on this project.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.800
Since I was going to be writing
about the Dulles brothers,

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.100
I found the YouTube video
where President Kennedy

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.570
opened that airport
in the early '60s.

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:50.730
And he has a nice ceremony.

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:52.960
Former President
Eisenhower's there.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.290
Allen Dulles was there.

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.250
The widow of Foster Dulles
and various dignitaries.

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.400
Kennedy made a
nice little speech.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.620
Then he pulled the
curtain back, and there

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:05.500
was the big bust of
John Foster Dulles that

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.475
stands in the middle
of Dulles Airport.

00:06:07.475 --> 00:06:10.350
And as I stared at that clip,
I started asking myself,

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.895
I never saw--
where is that bust?

00:06:12.895 --> 00:06:14.270
I've been through
Dulles Airport.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.561
I wasn't really looking for it.

00:06:15.561 --> 00:06:19.420
But if it stands right in
front of the reflecting pool,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.640
as I see on this video,
I must have gone by it.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.230
So I arranged to go through
Dulles Airport on my next trip.

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:28.250
And I asked the security
guard to direct me

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.839
to the Dulles bust,
and nobody could.

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:32.380
And then I finally
said, well, I know

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.760
it's right in front of
the reflecting pool.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.520
And then I was told there is
no reflecting pool in Dulles

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.560
airport.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.280
Sure enough, it's
a very long story,

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.280
but it turns out that
in the late '90s,

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.684
there was a renovation
at Dulles Airport.

00:06:45.684 --> 00:06:47.100
The reflecting
pool was filled in.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.975
The bust disappeared.

00:06:47.975 --> 00:06:51.380
I was never able to
figure out who ordered it.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.960
And through many phone calls and
emails, I was taken to see it.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.530
It's now in a closed
conference room

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.600
opposite Baggage Claim Number 3.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.960
And that really shows you what's
happened to the Dulles brothers

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.810
in our historical memory.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.610
So in my book, I'm trying
to bring them back to life.

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:12.780
I think part of the problem
we as Americans often

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.770
have is that we lack
a historical memory.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.750
We think that things
that happened today

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.000
must have just been
stimulated by things

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.150
that happened within
the last few weeks.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.660
But that's not true.

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:27.190
Countries that have existed
for much longer than we have,

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:31.570
like China and Iran, understand
countries go up and down.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.120
There are cycles of history.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.800
And you can't get away
with violently intervening

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:39.320
in the political affairs
of other countries,

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.740
without that having
some kind of effect,

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.220
even if that affect
does not become

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:48.980
clear until years or decades
or even generations later.

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:53.340
So within the framework of
the biography of the Dulles

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:56.530
brothers, I'm also looking
for the roots of some

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.450
of America's
problems in the world

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.640
and hoping that we can draw
some lessons from the Dulles

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.280
brothers.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.920
So let me talk a little
bit about who they were

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.320
and what their background was.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.580
One of the themes I try
to make clear in my book

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:13.600
is that the Dulles
brothers really

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:16.880
reflect a lot about America.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.230
In a sense, they're
quite extraordinary.

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:22.320
But on the other hand,
the forces that shaped

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.680
them are very much the forces
that shaped our country.

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.140
So what were those?

00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.300
I'm going to cite three
forces that I think

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:32.900
were very important in shaping
the Dulles brothers and the way

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.500
they saw the world.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.900
They grew up in a little town
called Watertown, New York,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.490
on the shores of
Lake Ontario, which

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:42.350
was kind of a playground
for the New York rich.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:45.980
Their father was a clergyman.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:50.730
And they grew up under the
wing of their grandfather--

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:52.780
it was truly an
extraordinary family-- who

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.430
had been Secretary of
State in the 1890s.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.870
In fact, he was the
first Secretary of State

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:02.010
to preside over the US overthrow
of a foreign government.

00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.620
That was in Hawaii 1893.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:07.400
So maybe it was something
genetic already in the family.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.705
So the two boys grew up
with their grandfather, who

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:12.630
had been Secretary of
State, and their uncle,

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:14.800
who also became
Secretary of State.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:19.120
So John Watson Foster was
the bewhiskered old man

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.520
who, with his nephew
Robert Lansing,

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.120
would take the two boys off
every morning on fishing trips

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.050
around Lake Ontario and
the adjoining streams.

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:31.920
And these were not just trips
to stock the wily small mouth

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.680
bass.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.900
They were great lessons
in American history.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.660
John Watson Foster,
the grandfather,

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.710
had lived the classic
American pioneer

00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:44.360
life in the age of
manifest destiny.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:49.500
He had gone to the West and
civilized the empty terrain

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:51.830
and fought the savages
and become prominent

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:55.310
and built his way into
influence and rose

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.210
to diplomatic
positions, including

00:09:57.210 --> 00:09:59.350
finally Secretary of State.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.360
He transmitted to his
grandsons this idea

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.040
that we call American
exceptionalism, the idea

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.680
that the United States
had a providential mission

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.320
in the world.

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.310
And it was to spread its
influence and its wisdom

00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:18.500
to all the benighted peoples
who were not wise enough

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.950
to see that the
American way of life

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:22.980
was destined to take
over the whole world.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.970
He thought of that
as a philosophy

00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:28.480
that he would follow
inside North America.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:31.690
But, of course, by the time the
grandchildren came to power,

00:10:31.690 --> 00:10:33.570
they were projecting
American influence

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:35.510
around the world
in the nuclear age.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:38.830
So that would have been one
big force that shaped them.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.370
They came from an
extraordinary family.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:44.220
In the winter times, they
would go to Washington

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.850
and spend months that
their grandfather's house.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:48.420
And there, the
dinner guests would

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.250
be Woodrow Wilson
and Grover Cleveland,

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:53.160
Bernard Baruch and
Andrew Carnegie

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:56.120
and a parade of senators
and ambassadors and cabinet

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.880
secretaries.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.190
So from a very young age,
they absorbed the attitudes

00:11:00.190 --> 00:11:03.680
and the vocabulary of
the American elite.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.850
In fact, Allen Dulles,
the younger brother,

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:09.540
when he was still
10, 12 years old,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.310
would go up to bed
after these dinners.

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:13.810
They were not allowed
to participate

00:11:13.810 --> 00:11:16.850
in the conversations, of
course, but could listen.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:21.090
And he would write reports
to himself of everybody

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:25.410
who attended and what they
said and what he, young Ally,

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:28.070
thought they really meant
behind what they said.

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.260
Here's a future director of the
CIA before the agency has even

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.820
been created, who
already has this impulse

00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:39.660
to be writing down his
impressions of other people.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:45.060
So, this atmosphere, growing
up in this extraordinary family

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:50.775
and receiving this message
of American exceptionalism,

00:11:50.775 --> 00:11:52.900
I think, was very important
for the Dulles brothers

00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:55.400
as it is for many of us.

00:11:55.400 --> 00:12:00.430
A second big factor that shaped
them was missionary Calvinism.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:02.267
So, as I said, the
father was a clergymen.

00:12:02.267 --> 00:12:03.600
The grandfather was a clergyman.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.183
The great grandfather
was a clergyman.

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.250
The uncles were clergyman.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.610
Many were missionaries too.

00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.970
At the Dulles household,
when they were boys,

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:12.660
there was often a
returning missionary

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.460
who had spend time
in China or in Syria,

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:20.080
talking about how great were the
trials and rewards of going out

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.310
into the world and
trying to civilize it.

00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:26.080
Missionary Calvinism,
first of all,

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:30.090
teaches there's good and
evil forces in the world.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:33.530
Not like some other cultures,
which teach that all of us

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.080
and all regimes and
all systems are made up

00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:38.632
of good and evil influences,
and these come out

00:12:38.632 --> 00:12:40.090
in different
proportions, according

00:12:40.090 --> 00:12:41.470
to different situations.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.230
The Dulles brothers did
not grow up believing that.

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:46.900
They believed that were
forces of good and evil

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.690
and that the good,
that is the Christians,

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:51.640
didn't have the luxury
of sitting at home

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.530
and just hoping for
the triumph of good.

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:59.020
The missionary ethos tells you
have to go out in the world

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.850
and assure the triumph of good.

00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:04.197
So if you believe
that about religion,

00:13:04.197 --> 00:13:06.280
it's just a short step to
believing the same thing

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:09.465
about politics, that we have
some regimes in the world that

00:13:09.465 --> 00:13:11.720
are based on pure,
good, godly principles.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:13.790
Then there's the evil bad ones.

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:15.820
And the good ones are
responsible for going out

00:13:15.820 --> 00:13:18.070
and crushing the bad ones.

00:13:18.070 --> 00:13:20.950
That would be a second big force
that I think shaped the Dulles

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.990
brothers and also is an
impulse that shapes America.

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:29.330
The final big force in shaping
them was the decades that they

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:33.570
spent working for this
unique Wall Street law firm

00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:36.550
called Sullivan and Cromwell.

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:38.970
This was not a law
firm like any other.

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:41.210
If you really need
a contract drawn up

00:13:41.210 --> 00:13:43.464
or you need to be
represented in the courtroom,

00:13:43.464 --> 00:13:44.880
they had people
who could do that.

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:48.070
But this was not why anybody
hired Sullivan Cromwell.

00:13:48.070 --> 00:13:50.500
That law firm had a specialty.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.850
It was pushing around
small countries

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.320
to do what big American
corporations wanted them to do.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.930
That's why every big American
multinational corporation

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:04.490
hired Sullivan and Cromwell.

00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:06.940
John Foster Dulles was
the managing partner

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:08.840
of Sullivan and
Cromwell for decades.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:12.220
And Allen Dulles also worked
there for extended periods.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.220
So this became their life.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:19.010
Just to give one example, soon
after John Foster Dulles came

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:21.870
to the firm, when he was
still a young associate,

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.250
they got a case from
their clients in Cuba.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.480
There they had the sugar
growers, the cement

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:30.330
manufacturers and
the railroad owners,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.400
and a group of mining concerns.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.540
What had happened?

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:34.760
Bad news from Cuba.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.160
There'd been an election.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.710
The liberals had won.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.530
The liberals had as
part of their platform

00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.400
limiting the amount of
land that farmers could own

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.440
and imposing taxes on
foreign-owned enterprises.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.790
So these enterprises came
to Sullivan and Cromwell

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:52.420
and said you've got to make
this problem go away for us.

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:54.970
The case went to
John Foster Dulles.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:57.010
The next morning he
got on the train,

00:14:57.010 --> 00:15:01.520
and he went to Washington to
see Uncle Bert, otherwise known

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:04.580
as Secretary of
State Robert Lansing.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:05.770
He explained the problem.

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:08.280
And Lansing asked him, what
do you think we should do?

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.180
Young lawyer Dulles said,
we should send two warships

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.830
to Cuba in the area where
the revolution is going on.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.470
The liberals were rebelling
against the refusal

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.350
of the conservatives
to recognize

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.650
the result of the election.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:21.860
The next morning the
two warships were sent.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:24.120
6,000 Marines debarked in Cuba.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.137
They put down the
liberal revolution.

00:15:26.137 --> 00:15:27.720
Everything was fine
for the companies.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.980
No taxes were imposed.

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.880
No restrictions on American
ownership were passed.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.510
And the occupation lasted
for another six years.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.670
Cubans got a little bit angrier,
but we didn't notice that

00:15:38.670 --> 00:15:40.510
until a few decades later.

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.920
So that's what John
Foster Dulles and Allen

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.530
Dulles did for a living.

00:15:44.530 --> 00:15:47.360
And when you have
spent that much time

00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.600
as such esteemed and
highly paid courtiers

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.760
for the American
plutocracy, you naturally

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.130
begin to absorb its perspective,
which is based on the idea

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:03.380
that what's good for American
multinational corporations

00:16:03.380 --> 00:16:05.770
should be the basis of
American foreign policy.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:10.040
And that's the idea they
took with them into office.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:15.870
In fact, towards the end of
their stay in private law,

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:18.210
just as they were moving
into their positions of power

00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:22.960
in the early '50s, they found a
couple of enemies in the world.

00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.750
And I think they took
up a couple of grudges

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:28.990
that they brought
with them into power.

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:31.570
Two things happened
in the early 1950s

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:35.420
that were very bad for
Sullivan and Cromwell clients--

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.060
clients of the Dulles brothers.

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.760
First of all, the democratically
elected government of Guatemala

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.720
imposed a land reform
act that affected

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.070
the interests of United Fruit
Company, one of the oldest

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:52.780
and most important clients
of the Dulles brothers.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.330
And around the same time,
the government of Iran

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:59.480
nationalized the
Iranian oil industry,

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:01.970
which had as its
financial agent its bank,

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:04.550
a bank that was a long-time
client of the Dulles brothers.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:08.589
And in fact, Allen Dulles was
on the board of that bank.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:10.546
So, as private
lawyers, there was

00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:11.920
nothing the Dulles
brothers could

00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.910
do to punish Prime Minister
Mossadegh in Iran and President

00:17:16.910 --> 00:17:18.589
Arbenz in Guatemala.

00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:20.720
But as soon as they
came into office,

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.560
they begin plotting
against those two guys.

00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.819
And within 18 months, both
of them had been overthrown.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:29.770
And these were
operations both that

00:17:29.770 --> 00:17:32.020
seemed like successes
at the time.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.790
I mean, if you take
the one in Iran.

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:37.840
So we got rid of a guy we
didn't like-- Mossadegh--

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.330
and we replaced them
with a guy, The Shah, who

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.510
would do whatever we wanted.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.890
So it seemed like
the perfect outcome.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.800
Now when we look
back at it, it really

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.586
doesn't look like it
came out so successfully.

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:51.960
Of course, that
cool was followed

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.650
by 25 years of rising
repression under the Shah,

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.340
and then the explosion
of the late 1970s,

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:01.260
the emergence of this
fanatically anti-American

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:04.710
religious regime with which
we've had to deal ever since.

00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:09.020
That is a result of the Dulles
brothers' original meddling

00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:12.120
there in the early 1950s.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:16.820
And you can trace the long-term
effects of these operations

00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:18.240
all over the world.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:20.980
One of the points of my
book is that although we

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.450
think of the 1950s
as a period of peace,

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:30.480
that's a mistake, that actually
the Dulles brothers were waging

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.510
an unbroken world war
during that period.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.710
We didn't see it,
because it was mainly

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:39.260
fought quietly
under the surface.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.200
And when it did break
out into public view,

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.890
like it did in Guatemala
or in Indonesia,

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:47.100
we were told that it was
just a local uprising

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.810
and that we weren't involved.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:51.350
Also the theater of
operations in this war

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.480
kept changing, from
Iran to Guatemala

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:55.840
to Vietnam to
Indonesia to the Congo

00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.570
to Egypt to India to Cuba.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.010
But the people on
the receiving end

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.250
were fully aware of what
was happening to them.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:09.020
Vietnam is really a
great example, really

00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:12.480
one of the most sobering
of all the ones I came up

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.600
with when researching the
career of these extraordinary

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.660
brothers.

00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.420
John Foster Dulles,
it turns out,

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:24.410
was more responsible for
the US engagement in Vietnam

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:27.200
than any single individual.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.640
The story is this.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:32.610
In 1954, the big powers
convened in Geneva

00:19:32.610 --> 00:19:34.630
to decide what to
do about Indochina.

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.875
Just as they were
meeting, Ho Chi Minh

00:19:36.875 --> 00:19:40.210
was winning his big victory
at the Dien Bien Phu.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.410
This led the French to
decide with great pain,

00:19:43.410 --> 00:19:44.770
we're finished.

00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.610
We have to withdraw.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:46.570
We lost the war.

00:19:46.570 --> 00:19:49.830
The British also realized,
it's over for us there.

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:52.860
And they all arrived at Geneva
along with the other powers

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.690
with the idea that Ho
Chi Minh, unfortunately,

00:19:55.690 --> 00:19:58.260
had earned on the
battlefield his right

00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:01.910
to one sliver of Indochina.

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.390
Within a couple
of days, it became

00:20:03.390 --> 00:20:06.340
clear to John Foster Dulles who
headed the American delegation

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.440
what was going to happen
at the conference,

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.440
that they were ready to concede
a chance for Ho Chi Minh

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.210
to compete freely
for power in Vietnam.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:17.957
Foster Dulles could
not accept this.

00:20:17.957 --> 00:20:20.040
He believed that just
because the French could not

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.812
defeat Ho Chi Minh
and the British

00:20:21.812 --> 00:20:24.020
hadn't been able to do it
and the Japanese had failed

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.380
to do it, that didn't mean
the Americans couldn't do it.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.780
So he left the conference.

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.280
It's the only time in history
that an American Secretary

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.320
of State has walked out of a
major international conference

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.646
in the middle.

00:20:35.646 --> 00:20:39.370
And he flew home, and he
told his brother Allen,

00:20:39.370 --> 00:20:41.570
you've got to start a
major operation in Vietnam.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.072
We are going to
fight Ho Chi Minh.

00:20:44.072 --> 00:20:48.890
If that one guy had not made
that one decision on that one

00:20:48.890 --> 00:20:50.690
day as he was flying
home from Geneva,

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:55.310
we might have avoided the
entire American involvement

00:20:55.310 --> 00:20:55.830
in Vietnam.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.306
And you can't even wrap your
mind around how different

00:20:59.306 --> 00:21:00.680
America and Vietnam
and the world

00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:04.141
might be under
those circumstances.

00:21:04.141 --> 00:21:06.390
Now one thing that's curious
about the Dulles brothers

00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:09.084
as I get to know them, of
course, living with them

00:21:09.084 --> 00:21:11.000
more or less as I did
while writing this book,

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:20.230
is that although they saw the
world in the exact same way,

00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:23.354
their personalities were
actually quite different.

00:21:23.354 --> 00:21:25.270
one of the worst things
about having these two

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:27.080
brothers in there
was that they had

00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.650
come up and grown up
and seen the world

00:21:30.650 --> 00:21:33.860
and arrived at beliefs
that were identical.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.260
So they converted the
foreign policy-making process

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:40.270
into a kind of at
reverberating echo chamber

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.970
for their own shared beliefs.

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:43.960
They never consulted
anyone outside.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:46.280
They were actually highly
unimaginative people

00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:46.990
intellectually.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.600
That's another great
lesson for today.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.160
What they believed
when they were 12

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.840
is essentially what they
believed their whole lives.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.580
So they saw the world
very much in the same way

00:21:56.580 --> 00:22:00.930
from the Wall Street and
covert action perspective.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:03.640
But their personalities
were polar opposites.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:05.900
So John Foster Dulles,
the older brother,

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:11.210
was dour, arrogant,
self-righteous, socially

00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:15.920
awkward, very
unpleasant dinner guest.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.720
He couldn't remember
people's names around him.

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:24.705
I read in one book even his
friends didn't like him.

00:22:24.705 --> 00:22:26.590
He had these awkward
habits, like he

00:22:26.590 --> 00:22:30.010
used to drink Old
Overholt, rye whisky,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.780
and he would stir it
with his index finger

00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:34.700
and then put the finger
in his mouth and suck

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.574
on it for a while and
then stir it some more.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.930
At one point,
Winston Churchill got

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:46.750
very irritated at how Dulles'
rhetorical anger always

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:48.150
produced confrontations.

00:22:48.150 --> 00:22:52.530
And he described Foster
Dulles as "the only bull

00:22:52.530 --> 00:22:58.150
who carries his own China
shop around with him."

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.429
But I actually liked Harold
MacMillan's comment better--

00:23:01.429 --> 00:23:02.720
another British prime minister.

00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:05.035
He was talking
about Foster Duller,

00:23:05.035 --> 00:23:09.990
and he said "his
speech was slow,

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:15.970
but it easily kept pace
with his thoughts."

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.050
But Allen Dulles was
completely different.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:20.556
Allen Dulles was a
sparkling conversationalist

00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:23.730
and a great dinner guest
who loved fine wine

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.660
and played tennis and had a
hundred affairs with everybody

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:32.280
from Claire Booth Luce
to the Queen of Greece.

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:37.070
He was a sparkling presence on
the Washington social scene,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.090
as he had been in
New York earlier.

00:23:39.090 --> 00:23:42.950
And I think this was important
because, as head of the CIA,

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:46.370
which is in a new
agency in Washington,

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:51.210
Allen Dulles was
not only the chief

00:23:51.210 --> 00:23:55.490
of the invisible
government, he was also

00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.750
the ambassador of the
invisible government

00:23:59.750 --> 00:24:02.181
to the visible government.

00:24:02.181 --> 00:24:04.180
And I think there must
have been a lot of people

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:08.560
at those Georgetown parties who
left thinking to themselves,

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.460
we really don't know
what the CIA is.

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.380
We don't know what it does.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.446
But if it's run by such a
wonderful guy like Allen,

00:24:15.446 --> 00:24:19.630
it can't be doing much wrong.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:23.370
Now one reason that the Dulles
brothers were so successful

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:25.700
is that they did work in tandem.

00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:28.140
So Foster Dulles would
make public statements

00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:30.030
about the government
of Country X seeming

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.300
like it was being
dangerously infiltrated

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.320
by leftists or Communists.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.840
Meanwhile, Allen would work to
foment trouble in that country.

00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.850
Then, as trouble
would break out,

00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:43.830
Foster would make
speeches saying

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:46.690
we see that the
people of Country X

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.804
are very unhappy with their
leftist inspired regime.

00:24:49.804 --> 00:24:51.220
And we have nothing
to do with it.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:53.660
And then finally, those
regimes would collapse,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:57.730
as happened in Guatemala, Foster
would then go on the radio

00:24:57.730 --> 00:25:01.530
afterwards and say, thus,
the problem has been solved

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:05.530
by the Guatemalan
people themselves.

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.780
This approach was
quite successful

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:12.070
and it was fully supported
by President Eisenhower.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:16.590
Now, Eisenhower was a
fervent and intense supporter

00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:20.210
of covert action and
clandestine operations.

00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:21.380
Why was that?

00:25:21.380 --> 00:25:25.686
We don't know, because he didn't
talk about this in public.

00:25:25.686 --> 00:25:27.310
In those days, you
could really believe

00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.490
that those secrets would
go with you to your grave.

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:33.770
For reasons we all know,
nobody believes that anymore.

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:38.010
But I think we can speculate
on a couple of facts regarding

00:25:38.010 --> 00:25:38.750
Eisenhower.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:41.840
First of all, we
now know, as was not

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:46.260
clear to anybody in the
'50s, that covert operations

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:50.270
and secret actions had a good
role in winning World War II.

00:25:50.270 --> 00:25:56.560
The breaking of the Nazi codes
and other secret operations

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.850
were not known to the
public, but of course,

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:02.930
Eisenhower, as commander, must
been aware of all of them.

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:06.360
And the other reason I think
that Eisenhower might have been

00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.420
so strongly in favor
of covert action

00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:13.810
was that he would have seen it
as a kind of a peace project.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:16.310
Imagine this was a guy
who had to send people out

00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.690
to die by the thousands.

00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:20.660
This must have weighed on him.

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:24.350
And here was a way to get rid of
a foreign government you didn't

00:26:24.350 --> 00:26:27.652
like with just the loss
of maybe a few lives.

00:26:27.652 --> 00:26:29.110
And none of them
would be American.

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:30.620
And it would hardly
cost anything.

00:26:30.620 --> 00:26:34.540
So he must thought this
was a great solution.

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.130
He shared with the
Dulles brothers

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:41.810
one huge historical
misjudgement.

00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:49.200
And that was he had no concept
of what we now call blowback.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.070
It never occurred to the Dulles
brothers or to Eisenhower

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:56.160
that their interventions
in foreign countries

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.700
would have such profound
effects years and years later.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:03.510
It never dawned on
them that by deciding

00:27:03.510 --> 00:27:05.870
to confront Ho Chi
Minh in Vietnam,

00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:08.910
we would be setting off a
process in which millions would

00:27:08.910 --> 00:27:12.410
die, or that Civil War
would descend on Guatemala,

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:15.510
or that Iran would become
a giant geopolitical enemy

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.850
of ours all over the world.

00:27:18.850 --> 00:27:22.740
They really had, perhaps
because of their belief

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.910
in American exceptionalism,
this sense that the United

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:28.550
States was in some
way above history,

00:27:28.550 --> 00:27:34.000
that the tendency of history
to come back and bite people

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.250
and nations years later
didn't apply to us.

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.660
It's something
like believing you

00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.392
can beat your child every
single day until he's 18,

00:27:41.392 --> 00:27:43.600
and then on his 18th birthday,
you give him a big hug

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.140
and say, OK, forget
all that now.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.770
Just go and to be a
normal happy person.

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:54.260
I think in an indirect way, that
was a belief that Eisenhower

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.560
and the Dulles brothers had.

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.860
Now, if they could be
here to defend themselves

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:02.000
against this charge, I can
imagine one good observation

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.680
they might make.

00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:06.710
They might say, we
didn't know this.

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:11.820
We didn't know that covert
operations can add huge effects

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.815
50 years later, because 50
years before we were in power,

00:28:14.815 --> 00:28:17.400
there hadn't been any
covert operations.

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.050
But this at least is an
argument we don't have today.

00:28:20.050 --> 00:28:24.806
We now have many examples to
show us long-term consequences.

00:28:24.806 --> 00:28:26.180
And the Dulles
brothers have been

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:30.292
generous in leaving us
quite a number of those.

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:32.000
I think the Dulles
brothers made a couple

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.660
of other historical misjudgments
from which we can learn today.

00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:43.070
One is that they were
absolutely opposed

00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.780
to any direct contact
between the United States

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.480
and any of its geopolitical
rivals or enemies.

00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.630
They were absolutely opposed
to any summit meetings

00:28:55.630 --> 00:29:00.110
between American leaders
and Soviet leaders.

00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:04.200
They were in power
just a couple of months

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:09.750
when Stalin died in the Soviet
Union at the beginning of 1953.

00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:11.690
It only took a few
months after that

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.270
before peace feelers began
emerging from the Kremlin

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.730
to see if the
United States might

00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.990
be interested in a
changed relationship.

00:29:19.990 --> 00:29:22.960
At the end of 1953,
a summit conference

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:26.520
was held in Bermuda by what
was then called The Big Three.

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:30.090
That was France, Britain,
and the United States.

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:31.680
And there, one of
the agenda items

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.680
was a request by Malekov
who was the temporary leader

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.910
in the Kremlin, for what he
could call a Big Four summit.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:43.120
So France, Britain, United
States and Soviet Union.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.400
Let's all get together.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.390
Churchill, who was there,
thought this was a great idea.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:49.350
The French were favoring it.

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:52.600
But John Foster Dulles
was totally against.

00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:53.680
He vetoed it.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.140
No summit was held.

00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:59.610
It was Foster Dulles's
idea that the Cold War was

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:03.220
built on a paradigm
of conflict and then

00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:06.690
once you would sit down with
your arrival across the table,

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:09.780
you convey to the American
public above all, this view

00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.110
that the Soviets are just
normal people like anybody else.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:14.530
And maybe they have an idea.

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.070
Or they'll listen to our ideas.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:19.220
And maybe we can work out some
kind of a compromise with them.

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:23.300
They felt that just
the germ of that idea

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:27.050
would undermine their whole
approach to the world, which

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.900
was based on the fact that
there were only two blocks,

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:35.860
and you could not fail to
take sides between them.

00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.470
And that leads into
what I think was

00:30:37.470 --> 00:30:41.320
the third great misjudgement
that the Dulles brothers made,

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:44.910
another one for which
we're still paying today.

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.960
That is, they
completely misjudged

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.120
the nature of Third
World nationalism.

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.870
Now, this is a period
after World War

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:56.850
II when many countries
were emerging

00:30:56.850 --> 00:31:00.380
from colonialism
of different kinds.

00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:01.910
They were looking
for their place

00:31:01.910 --> 00:31:04.930
in a very turbulent new world.

00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:07.860
And many some were
led by people who

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.510
recognized huge needs at home.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.930
They did not want to waste
their political energies

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:16.760
on getting involved
in the Cold War.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.320
So their foreign policy
was we're not pro-Moscow,

00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:20.850
we're not pro-Washington.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.160
We're not interested.

00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.910
We don't care.

00:31:23.910 --> 00:31:27.810
This was a point of
view that was completely

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:29.940
unacceptable to
John Foster Dulles.

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.820
He even used the word immoral
to describe neutralism.

00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:38.170
So essentially what
the Dulles policy did

00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:41.960
was drive away from
the United States

00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:47.300
leaders and nations that
were eager to be our friends.

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:50.720
We looked around the
world at neutralists

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:56.950
and saw not leaders who were
trying to embody new people's

00:31:56.950 --> 00:32:01.240
emerging onto the world
stage, but secret pawns

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.870
of the Kremlin.

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.490
I'm talking about people
like Mossadegh in Iran,

00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:11.120
Arbenz in Guatemala,
Sukarno in Indonesia,

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:17.930
Lumumba in the Congo, Nehru
in India, Nasser in Egypt.

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.970
These were all people
who were trying

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:23.810
to embody national
struggles at home

00:32:23.810 --> 00:32:27.760
and had as essential parts
of their political ideology

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.360
nonalignment.

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.200
At one point, Allen Dulles
had this project for Nasser.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.040
We are going to take
Arab nationalism

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.670
and we're going to turn it
to a pro-American ideal.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:41.050
We can have Arab nationalism
plus pro-American sentiment

00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:41.770
together.

00:32:41.770 --> 00:32:43.504
This is a complete
misunderstanding

00:32:43.504 --> 00:32:44.670
of what Arab nationalism is.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:45.700
That's the whole point.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:48.500
We're not going to be aligned
with any outside force.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.980
That's page one, line one.

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:53.260
But the Americans
couldn't understand that.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:57.630
So as a result, we set
in motion processes

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:02.280
that robbed us of long-term
potential geo-strategic

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.950
friends.

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:09.430
And these are all lessons that I
think have relevance for today.

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.770
First of all, we need
to take other countries

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:14.270
on their own terms,
and not insist

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:17.120
that they be for
us or against us.

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:21.780
Secondly, I think the
idea of not talking

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.700
to rivals and enemies has
gotten us into a lot of trouble.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:28.740
I would say this now
in the last few months,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.740
we've seen a couple of
interesting developments.

00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:33.140
First of all, the President
of the United States

00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.680
wanted to bomb a
foreign country, Syria,

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:39.840
but many Americans were against
it and many members of Congress

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:40.590
were against it.

00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:42.484
And it didn't happen.

00:33:42.484 --> 00:33:44.880
That was a pretty big event.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.090
I can't remember
any time in my life

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:49.770
when the President of the states
wanted to bomb another country,

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.100
but he didn't do it because
people were against it.

00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:54.660
Usually it's the
other way around.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:57.240
And then, soon after that, the
President of the United States

00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.690
picked up the phone and spoke
with the President of Iran.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:03.610
And we are now involved in a
negotiating process with Iran.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:06.330
So when those kind of
things happen, I ask myself

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.729
did the Dulles era just end?

00:34:08.729 --> 00:34:10.848
Like within the last
couple of months?

00:34:10.848 --> 00:34:11.389
I don't know.

00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:14.580
I'm thinking maybe
this is the result

00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.630
of us having had some very
bad luck in our last few wars,

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.170
and maybe people are a
little bit punch drunk.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:21.739
As soon as we get
the smelling salts,

00:34:21.739 --> 00:34:24.670
maybe America will be back
making the same mistakes again.

00:34:24.670 --> 00:34:25.170
But.

00:34:25.170 --> 00:34:29.270
I like to think
that as time passes,

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:35.400
were able to learn from
some of our past mistakes.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:40.719
Now, I finished my book
with an observation

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:46.280
about what I consider to
be a great masterpiece

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:50.109
of 20th century political art.

00:34:50.109 --> 00:34:52.650
When I'm teaching, I don't like
to measure anything like this

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.670
to my students, because they
always open up their iPads

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:55.159
right away.

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:56.659
But those of you
that have the book,

00:34:56.659 --> 00:34:59.900
it's the last panel
in the photo insert.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.825
Let me just talk
briefly about it.

00:35:01.825 --> 00:35:07.635
So in 1954, the Dulles
brothers directed the overthrow

00:35:07.635 --> 00:35:12.840
of the government of
Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala.

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.006
This caused huge outrage
in Latin America,

00:35:16.006 --> 00:35:18.005
including in Mexico, which
borders on Guatemala,

00:35:18.005 --> 00:35:20.880
and where there's a big
anti-imperialist tradition.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:24.270
At that time, Frida
Kahlo was lying

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.920
on her deathbed, forbidden
to leave the house.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.830
But she was so angry at the
US overthrow of the Guatemalan

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:33.530
government, she told Diego
Rivera, we're going out.

00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:35.940
We're going to march
in the protest parade.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:40.620
And you can find a photo
of Diego Rivera pushing

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.940
Frida Kahlo in the
front of the protest

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:46.610
parade against the
American coup in Guatemala.

00:35:46.610 --> 00:35:49.950
She died 11 days later.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.850
And Diego Rivera set out to
paint this fantastic mural.

00:35:54.850 --> 00:35:59.640
So it's 16 feet long on linen,
and it tells the whole story.

00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:03.220
So right in the middle,
you see John Foster Dulles

00:36:03.220 --> 00:36:07.570
with a big grin on his face,
Allen Dulles right behind him

00:36:07.570 --> 00:36:10.270
with his head over on
Foster's shoulder with money

00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:14.950
coming out of the packet on
his belt, if you can see that.

00:36:14.950 --> 00:36:17.545
Foster is shaking hands
with the Guatemalan

00:36:17.545 --> 00:36:20.700
he has placed in as
the new dictator.

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.170
You see the archbishop
blessing at all,

00:36:23.170 --> 00:36:27.330
while out workers are bending
under the weight of bananas

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.020
stems they're carrying
on to a freighter

00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:32.290
with the American flag on it.

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.860
And dead Guatemalan children
are in the background.

00:36:34.860 --> 00:36:37.755
And of course, Eisenhower's
big smiling face

00:36:37.755 --> 00:36:41.310
is on the bomb
right in the middle.

00:36:41.310 --> 00:36:47.140
So Allen Dulles
loved this picture.

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:49.960
He actually had copies made
up to hand it out to people.

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:51.974
He loved the fact
that Diego Rivera

00:36:51.974 --> 00:36:53.140
was portraying him this way.

00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:55.190
Diego Rivera, of
course, was a Communist,

00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:57.540
so it worked out well for Allen.

00:36:57.540 --> 00:36:59.240
While I was finishing
this book, I

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.740
decided-- I know this
picture very well.

00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.250
I've stared at it on
the internet for hours.

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.520
I know every inch of it.

00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.080
But I want to go and
see it in real life.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.435
So I have to find out--
there's various Diego Rivera

00:37:11.435 --> 00:37:13.810
museums in Mexico-- I have to
find out which one it's in.

00:37:13.810 --> 00:37:15.550
I'm going to go find it.

00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:16.836
And I made a trip to Mexico.

00:37:16.836 --> 00:37:18.210
And I started
making phone calls.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:19.280
But I couldn't find it.

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.670
And one thing led to another.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.660
I had to leave.

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.060
I lost it.

00:37:23.060 --> 00:37:26.570
Then I had to do a long
investigative project.

00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:28.440
And I found out the following.

00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:32.490
That picture disappeared
in the 1950s.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:35.660
What happened was that
Diego Rivera donated it

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.020
to the people of
the Soviet Union.

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:41.690
But the Soviets didn't
like Diego Rivera,

00:37:41.690 --> 00:37:44.277
because he wasn't considered
a real Communist over there.

00:37:44.277 --> 00:37:45.360
He was too Latin American.

00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:46.910
He had different
ideas every day.

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:48.630
He wasn't doctrinaire enough.

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:49.690
So the next thing you know,
the painting just disappeared.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:50.930
And nobody followed it up.

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:55.590
And it wasn't the early '90s,
that a group of art historians

00:37:55.590 --> 00:37:59.440
in Mexico started a kind
of a project to find it.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.340
And sure enough,
they located it.

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:06.550
It's in the basement of the
Pushkin Museum in Moscow.

00:38:06.550 --> 00:38:08.320
That's where it ended up.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:12.250
So I had to decide,
OK, Mexico's nearby.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.990
Moscow, very far away.

00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:16.710
But am I going to make
a special trip to Moscow

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.600
just to stand in
front of this picture.

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.910
So I decide yes,
I'm going to do it.

00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:23.740
So through a long
process, I finally

00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.530
got in touch with
the deputy curator

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:27.150
for whatever-- the
Pushkin Museum.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:31.840
And I got back an email, and
it says, if you come to Moscow,

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.250
I will take you to the
basement and show you

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:37.350
the roll on which this
painting is rolled up.

00:38:37.350 --> 00:38:42.030
But I cannot unroll it because
we don't have the space.

00:38:42.030 --> 00:38:46.430
So this means that this
painting is essentially--

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:48.350
I don't want to
say lost forever.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:49.140
It's still there.

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:51.120
I guess it's not deteriorating.

00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:52.660
But nobody can see it.

00:38:52.660 --> 00:38:54.890
Nobody can benefit from it.

00:38:54.890 --> 00:39:00.847
So it's my new fantasy that we
should resurrect that picture.

00:39:00.847 --> 00:39:02.680
And I know exactly where
I want it to stand.

00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:05.000
I think it should be the
centerpiece of Dulles

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.140
International Airport.

00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:06.904
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:06.904 --> 00:39:08.720
STEPHEN KINZER: It
would be the way for us

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.440
to look at the picture and ask
ourselves the real questions.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.090
Take the air brush
off these guys' faces,

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.900
and see if they
don't have something

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.560
that they can still teach us.

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.690
Thank you.

00:39:20.690 --> 00:39:24.574
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:24.574 --> 00:39:25.490
STEPHEN KINZER: Great.

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:29.830
I'm more than happy to
take some questions.

00:39:29.830 --> 00:39:31.530
Go ahead.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.030
AUDIENCE: I was reading
recently that democracy

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.040
has been spreading
across the globe.

00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:42.710
I skeptically that heard that as
a message from our own culture,

00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.130
but this was from-- I don't
remember which organization

00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:52.330
or which organizations were
rating various countries as

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:53.830
whether they were
democratic or not,

00:39:53.830 --> 00:39:55.680
and showing the
rate of progressing.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.530
Do you think the Dulles
brothers promoted

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:02.840
that someone actually pursuing
their goals made no difference,

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.564
or actually hindered it
by causing more blowback?

00:40:05.564 --> 00:40:07.230
STEPHEN KINZER: I
think there's no doubt

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:10.760
that the Dulles brothers'
net effect was reducing

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.110
the level of democracy
in the world.

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:19.280
And I've asked myself this
question, given how outspokenly

00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:23.660
committed they were to the
ideals of liberty and freedom,

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:26.900
how could it be that they
would arrive in countries that

00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:31.050
were relatively free, like,
say, Iran or Guatemala,

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.220
and when they leave,
it's under a dictatorship

00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:35.570
that becomes quite brutal.

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:38.380
I think it's because of this.

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.000
I think the Dulles
brothers had to develop

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.890
an idea of democracy, a
definition of democracy that

00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:50.960
would allow them
to say, actually

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.820
Guatemala was more democratic
under the military junta

00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.300
then it was under the
elected government of Arbenz,

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.570
and that the Shah was actually
a more democratic leader who

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:05.170
allowed more freedom
than the elected

00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.620
government of Mossadegh.

00:41:06.620 --> 00:41:09.600
So here's the definition
I think they came up with.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:14.600
Their idea was a
country is free,

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:19.030
if it has the fundamental
freedom that allows everybody

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:24.420
to trade, companies can come
and buy, companies can sell.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.360
Anybody can start a business.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:29.490
There's no heavy
restriction on commerce.

00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:32.110
Foreign trade is welcome.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:35.030
That's a sign of democracy.

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:38.870
Now if you use that
standard, then maybe

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:42.400
you can say that Guatemala
was more democratic

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.280
under the dictatorship,
because then there

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.910
were no taxes on United Fruit.

00:41:46.910 --> 00:41:49.394
The phone company and
the electric company

00:41:49.394 --> 00:41:51.060
could charge whatever
rates they wanted.

00:41:51.060 --> 00:41:53.810
They were not being bothered
by child labor laws and all

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.180
these other regulations that
the Arbenz government tried

00:41:58.180 --> 00:42:01.690
to place on them, which
certainly would have restricted

00:42:01.690 --> 00:42:04.980
the freedom of the
United Fruit Company.

00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:07.510
So I think this is
the argument that they

00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:08.850
developed for themselves.

00:42:08.850 --> 00:42:14.810
And it allowed them to replace
elected governments that

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:19.570
allowed civil rights with
unelected governments

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:24.170
that repressed civil rights and
still go to church on Sunday

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:29.300
and thank God that they were
not evil like other men.

00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:31.390
AUDIENCE: Well, so
given that, where

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:32.820
do you think that
these guys would

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:37.250
fall on a socio-pathology scale?

00:42:37.250 --> 00:42:41.170
Because having such
that background

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:43.710
that they took one part
of it from but left out

00:42:43.710 --> 00:42:46.800
the whole other part
of Christianity,

00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:52.260
these men were both responsible
for deaths of individuals,

00:42:52.260 --> 00:42:54.940
both indiscriminate
and very discriminate,

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:59.280
where their word went to
have these people killed.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.040
Their treatment of
the rest of the world

00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.180
was based upon what was
really good for the Dulles

00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:08.790
brothers themselves
and their friends.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:13.010
Allen was a huge
adulterer who had

00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:17.060
no care about his
consequences for that.

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:24.040
And maybe other evil things
related to internal problems

00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.645
in our country, like
regime change at home.

00:43:30.752 --> 00:43:34.710
STEPHEN KINZER: Yeah, I
think the Dulles brothers can

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:40.660
be held responsible for
an approach to politics

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:43.590
that I think still
is very powerful.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:47.400
Every time I go to Washington,
which is as rarely as possible,

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:52.460
I am impressed with how powerful
is the force that brings people

00:43:52.460 --> 00:43:55.700
towards the foreign
policy consensus

00:43:55.700 --> 00:44:01.400
and how narrow is the spectrum
of acceptable opinions

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.560
on foreign policy issues.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.222
You have to accept an entire
string of assumptions.

00:44:07.222 --> 00:44:08.930
Otherwise, you're
thought of as some kind

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:13.630
of a wacko who will never got
a lunch invitation in this town

00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:15.330
again.

00:44:15.330 --> 00:44:18.230
The Dulles brothers
were not thoughtful.

00:44:18.230 --> 00:44:19.640
They were not imaginative.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:23.610
They just embraced cliches
and existing paradigms.

00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.900
I hold this against them.

00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.390
Actually, for all
their opportunity

00:44:27.390 --> 00:44:30.180
and their education, they were
actually quite narrow-minded.

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:33.650
And I think maybe
their background

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.750
afflicted them a little
bit with that in this way.

00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:42.330
One thing that I think is
very important to understand

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:45.460
if you want to understand
the world and statesmanship

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:48.057
is that sometimes things go
well and sometimes things

00:44:48.057 --> 00:44:48.640
don't go well.

00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:50.139
There's a lot of
problems out there.

00:44:50.139 --> 00:44:52.292
And that's the way life is.

00:44:52.292 --> 00:44:55.420
But life was never like that
for the Dulles brothers.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.860
For them, and for the
people that they knew,

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.370
which was exclusively their own
class, nothing ever went wrong.

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.820
The catastrophic
reversal of fortune,

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:09.310
the sudden loss of everything,
the collapse of all hopes,

00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:12.280
the family that falls apart--
this didn't happened to them.

00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.420
They were really
isolated from this.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.260
And I think maybe from
this, unconsciously,

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.190
they assimilated this view
that everything's always

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:21.410
going to work out fine.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:22.660
After all, we're America.

00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:25.070
And in the end, it
comes out great.

00:45:25.070 --> 00:45:29.420
The can-do mentality is
a very positive thing.

00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:30.460
It's what built America.

00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:32.160
And it's what
built this company.

00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.630
It tells us that we
can overcome obstacles,

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:37.890
posed by other countries,
by other peoples,

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:41.480
by environment, by technology.

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.790
But there are some
obstacles that you

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.580
can't overcome just because
you want to overcome them.

00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:48.850
Many obstacles that face
United States and the world

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.050
are deep-seated ones that
are posed by cultures

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.200
of other countries, that have
existed long before the United

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.160
States even emerged
on this earth.

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:01.410
And that's the dark side
of the can-do mentality.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.930
The can-do mentality tells
you if you're American,

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:06.200
and you really want
something enough,

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.487
and you really, really work
hard, you're going to get it.

00:46:09.487 --> 00:46:11.320
This is a nice thing
to believe, but it also

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.200
has a negative side.

00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.621
AUDIENCE: Did they-- you're kind
of alluding to this-- but did

00:46:19.621 --> 00:46:21.960
they ever study history?

00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:26.867
Or had the history been
written yet or interpreted yet

00:46:26.867 --> 00:46:32.550
of prior US governments that
played like this and then

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:34.450
bad things started to happen?

00:46:34.450 --> 00:46:37.300
So like Teddy Roosevelt
and his treatment

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.257
of Japan, Korea and China.

00:46:39.257 --> 00:46:40.840
Were people aware
of the ramifications

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:44.051
of that then 40 years later?

00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:45.925
STEPHEN KINZER: First
of all, I don't believe

00:46:45.925 --> 00:46:48.190
that in that particular
episode, Americans

00:46:48.190 --> 00:46:51.040
had any understanding that
Roosevelt's intervention

00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:53.860
in Japan and Korea
actually set in motion,

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:55.630
in some ways, what
led to Pearl Harbor.

00:46:55.630 --> 00:46:58.230
Even now, I think few
people are aware of that.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:47:00.070
But in a more general
sense, you asked about

00:47:00.070 --> 00:47:01.945
whether the Dulles
brothers had read history.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:07.910
I guess they did, but I think
they were victim to something

00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:11.440
that I think still
afflicts many Americans.

00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.530
And that is the view
that history really

00:47:14.530 --> 00:47:17.620
doesn't apply to us.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.670
I think there's a view
that there's never

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:23.090
been a country like
the United States.

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:25.760
I read from Marco Rubio,
the Florida senator,

00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.750
not only is this the
greatest country on earth,

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:29.350
this is the greatest
civilization

00:47:29.350 --> 00:47:33.650
that has ever existed in
the history of the world.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:38.790
I think this view does lead
you naturally to think, well,

00:47:38.790 --> 00:47:40.710
of course, these
forces afflicted

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:43.630
the Persian empire
and the German empire

00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:46.870
and the Chinese empire
centuries and centuries ago.

00:47:46.870 --> 00:47:48.840
But that doesn't apply to us.

00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.290
So I think even worse than
learning the wrong lessons

00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:55.610
from history, is to believe
that history has no lessons

00:47:55.610 --> 00:47:57.330
to teach you at all.

00:47:57.330 --> 00:47:59.130
And I think maybe
this is something

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.630
that the Dulles
brothers fell victim to.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:02.860
We had this phrase.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.960
It came out in the
1940s by Henry Luce,

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.470
who was one of their
great comrades,

00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:09.290
saying that the 20th
century was going

00:48:09.290 --> 00:48:11.090
to be the American century.

00:48:11.090 --> 00:48:15.170
Now it becomes our time
to be the powerhouse.

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.980
So we assimilated this
view that what's good

00:48:17.980 --> 00:48:20.270
for the United States
is always going

00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:22.205
to be what's good for the world.

00:48:22.205 --> 00:48:23.830
And what's good for
the Dulles brothers

00:48:23.830 --> 00:48:25.250
and the people they
knew and worked for

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.870
is what's good for
the United States.

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:28.710
And to a certain degree,
I think we're still

00:48:28.710 --> 00:48:31.605
falling victim to that.

00:48:31.605 --> 00:48:33.105
AUDIENCE: That's a
little bit unfair

00:48:33.105 --> 00:48:36.358
and perhaps a
caricature, I think.

00:48:36.358 --> 00:48:39.662
I mean, George Kennan
wrote quite a bit

00:48:39.662 --> 00:48:45.860
about containment in early
'40s, late to mid '30s.

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:48.400
And you may argue that
the Dulles-- I don't

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.775
know much about
this book at all.

00:48:49.775 --> 00:48:54.130
And I haven't read the history
behind these two. gentlemen.

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:58.680
But it's certainly true
that the calculus of power

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:01.660
involves an appraisal
of your adversary.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.570
And in some sense, a
nuclear power, I think,

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:07.750
we deal with quite
differently than one

00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:10.090
that doesn't, just
to make an example.

00:49:10.090 --> 00:49:15.200
So I think it's kind of unfair
to say that Americans believe

00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:18.770
or there's this thought that
we can just willy-nilly exert

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.360
our power, because
in some sense,

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:25.910
I think a lot of the '50s and
late-'60s were driven by this

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:31.220
view of containing the
social regime that was viewed

00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:35.780
as expansionist by all
intelligence that we could

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.622
gather.

00:49:36.622 --> 00:49:38.080
So could you speak
to a little bit,

00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:42.370
to maybe the intelligent part
of the argument rather than

00:49:42.370 --> 00:49:44.140
the caricature?

00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.210
STEPHEN KINZER: Well,
Kennan and others definitely

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.760
had a view for how to
manage the Cold War.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.780
And Kennan was fired
from the State Department

00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:54.835
by John Foster Dulles,
because there wasn't room

00:49:54.835 --> 00:49:55.543
for both of them.

00:49:55.543 --> 00:49:58.690
And in fact, John
Foster Dulles, who

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:03.130
wrote Eisenhower speeches during
the 1952 presidential campaign

00:50:03.130 --> 00:50:08.170
and wrote the Republican
platform on foreign policy,

00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:10.780
was an explicit opponent
of the containment

00:50:10.780 --> 00:50:14.230
idea, which he called immoral.

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:18.590
And his alternative was what
became known as rollback.

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.710
He called it the
"liberation policy,"

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:22.480
that we're going to
go back and roll back

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.200
Communism where it now exists.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.570
Now, once coming
into office, he never

00:50:28.570 --> 00:50:30.790
pursued that rollback
or liberation policy.

00:50:30.790 --> 00:50:33.390
In fact, while continuing
to condemn containment,

00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:34.970
he effectively embraced it.

00:50:34.970 --> 00:50:36.760
And we saw that twice.

00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.000
In East Germany in
1953, workers rose up

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.560
against their
Communist government.

00:50:42.560 --> 00:50:44.140
If we were interested
in rollback,

00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.015
that would have been
the moment to help them.

00:50:46.015 --> 00:50:48.730
It happened again
in 1956 in Hungary.

00:50:48.730 --> 00:50:50.740
Tragically, those
people had to listen

00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.640
to the rhetoric from
Washington and believed

00:50:53.640 --> 00:50:56.480
that Washington actually
supported rollback.

00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:57.390
We actually didn't.

00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:59.580
It was all rhetorical.

00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.210
But I think that after
coming to office,

00:51:02.210 --> 00:51:05.420
the Dulles brothers did
conclude, with Eisenhower

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:08.547
serving as a calming
influence in this case,

00:51:08.547 --> 00:51:09.880
rollback is not going to happen.

00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:11.850
You cannot attack
the Soviet Union.

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:13.990
We're not invading China.

00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:17.500
But still they felt the
need for striking back.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.740
There was, as you say, a
sense that the Soviet empire

00:51:21.740 --> 00:51:24.187
and sphere of influence
was relentlessly expanding.

00:51:24.187 --> 00:51:26.520
You can argue about whether
that was really true or not,

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.730
but at the moment
it seemed that way.

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:33.240
And so, unable to strike
against the real enemy,

00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:35.780
the Dulles brothers
then had to go strike

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.870
against the secondary enemy
that they could overthrow,

00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:41.810
like countries like
Iran and Guatemala.

00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:45.140
So I would say that
the Dulles brothers'

00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:48.540
sin in assessing
Communism, their mistake,

00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:53.520
was not that they exaggerated
its essentially evils.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.249
The way they portrayed the
Soviet Union and China,

00:51:56.249 --> 00:51:58.040
in terms of the way
they ruled domestically

00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.250
was not exaggerated.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:02.560
Those were just as evil
regimes as the Dulles brothers

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.700
portrayed them to be.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:08.170
But I think the mistake
the Dulles brothers made

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:13.050
was to transfer their
feelings about those countries

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:15.030
to places like
Guatemala and Iran

00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:19.000
and Indonesia, where those
circumstances did not obtain.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.200
But the need to have
a victory and to seem

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.320
like we were pushing
back, I think

00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:27.670
led them, for reasons I
think we can understand,

00:52:27.670 --> 00:52:30.880
to carry out actions
that in the long run

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.802
actually wound up fomenting
and supporting the forces

00:52:34.802 --> 00:52:36.010
that we were trying to crush.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.510
Just to give one
small example, we

00:52:38.510 --> 00:52:42.010
crushed the Guatemalan
revolution in 1954.

00:52:42.010 --> 00:52:45.340
That was a peaceful revolution,
so a land reform project.

00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:48.780
During that period
of 1953 and '54,

00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:52.960
many socialist and leftist
and idealistic young Latin

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.560
Americans came to Guatemala
to see what was happening.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.990
How do you reform a country?

00:52:58.990 --> 00:53:01.600
One of them was a
young Argentine doctor

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.460
named Che Guevara.

00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:05.686
Che Guevara was
there at the time

00:53:05.686 --> 00:53:07.560
the US overthrew the
government of Guatemala.

00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:10.060
It happens right after the end
of the movie, "The Motorcycle

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:10.640
Diaries."

00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:14.150
If it goes on 10 more
minutes, he's in Guatemala.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:15.250
He gets arrested.

00:53:15.250 --> 00:53:17.740
He has to take refuge
in the Mexican embassy.

00:53:17.740 --> 00:53:19.830
And finally he gets out.

00:53:19.830 --> 00:53:21.000
He gets back to Mexico.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.120
That's where he
meets Fidel Castro.

00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:26.300
Castro says to him, what
happened in Guatemala?

00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:29.610
And Che tells them, the idiots
that were running Guatemala

00:53:29.610 --> 00:53:32.410
thought they could reform
society with a democracy.

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.140
They allowed the free newspapers
to function and the army

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:37.260
not to be decapitated
and student groups

00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:40.240
and professional organizations
to thrive in a democracy.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.870
Of course, the CIA came
in, paid them all off

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:43.790
and overthrew them.

00:53:43.790 --> 00:53:45.940
So when we come
to power, let's be

00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.830
sure there's no free society,
no civil rights, no opposition

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:52.220
parties, and no dissent.

00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:55.030
That's the lesson that
ultimately came out

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:59.880
of what we thought we were
doing for freedom in Guatemala.

00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:01.595
AUDIENCE: I lived
through the disaster

00:54:01.595 --> 00:54:05.240
that was the '90s in Moscow.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:10.945
And I have this impression
that is so refreshing

00:54:10.945 --> 00:54:13.440
to hear from somebody who knows
what they're talking about

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:18.610
that the United States tends
to be inept in foreign policy.

00:54:18.610 --> 00:54:24.120
So I wonder what would your
advice, what your vision be,

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.362
to the relationship of US
and Russia going forward.

00:54:27.362 --> 00:54:28.820
STEPHEN KINZER:
Well, first of all,

00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.611
let me comment on one
of your observations.

00:54:30.611 --> 00:54:32.720
And this is something
I did come away

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.120
believing from my study
of the Dulles brothers.

00:54:35.120 --> 00:54:38.470
So Allen Dulles has this
reputation as the Great Spy

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:40.760
and the greatest spy
master of all time,

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.190
and Foster Dulles the great
wise man of the 20th century.

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:48.200
Actually, every single operation
they launched either failed

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:49.310
or almost failed.

00:54:49.310 --> 00:54:52.620
The Iran and Guatemala ones
seemed like they were lost.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.490
Then they won at
the last minute.

00:54:54.490 --> 00:54:56.160
And the others all failed.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.920
They couldn't overthrow Sukarno.

00:54:57.920 --> 00:54:59.770
They couldn't overthrow Nasser.

00:54:59.770 --> 00:55:02.640
They couldn't overthrow Castro.

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:05.070
So actually, they
were a lot more

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:09.140
like bumblers than super spies.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:14.240
I hate to stand in front of
you and talk about Russia,

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:18.050
because it's not my
field of expertise.

00:55:18.050 --> 00:55:19.990
I would just say that I'm torn.

00:55:19.990 --> 00:55:23.917
On the one hand,
I love Pussy Riot.

00:55:23.917 --> 00:55:26.000
I want them to be the junta
that runs the country.

00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.580
That's my heart speaking.

00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:33.090
On the other hand, my study
of the world, particularly

00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.170
countries that I
know a lot, like Iran

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.200
and that part of the
world, Central America,

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:42.070
has led me to believe in a
great axiom from Shakespeare

00:55:42.070 --> 00:55:45.090
that sometimes it's
better to bear those ills

00:55:45.090 --> 00:55:49.880
that we know than fly to
others that we know not of.

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.930
So I find the style of
leadership of Putin intensively

00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:54.430
frustrating.

00:55:54.430 --> 00:55:56.150
I couldn't live under that.

00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:58.960
On the other hand, I
can imagine a Russia

00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:03.500
that is Gagastan times 1,000.

00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.460
And then we might be
looking back and saying,

00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:09.840
couldn't we get
somebody like Putin?

00:56:09.840 --> 00:56:13.960
So I can see how things could
get a lot better than they are.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:16.190
But having watched
what I've watched

00:56:16.190 --> 00:56:18.990
and remembering that it
was only like two years ago

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:21.210
when we were looking
at Egypt and saying

00:56:21.210 --> 00:56:23.080
this is the greatest
blow for freedom

00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:28.920
since the French Revolution,
that maybe sometimes

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.810
we have to weigh in
the factor of stability

00:56:33.810 --> 00:56:38.080
as a key determinant
of human safety.

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.450
If you don't have
a stable society,

00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.790
you have no framework within
which to build anything.

00:56:43.790 --> 00:56:46.410
Now any tyrant can use
that as an argument also.

00:56:46.410 --> 00:56:47.900
Where do you draw the line?

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:51.300
That's the question for
citizens of any country.

00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:53.830
And I just close by
saying this, as we

00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:58.185
are taking this discussion
into the modern moment.

00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:05.840
I think here we are in a country
where levels of democracy

00:57:05.840 --> 00:57:06.770
are declining.

00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.100
I mean, we can certainly
see it in our own lifetimes.

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:12.490
The United States
has become a society

00:57:12.490 --> 00:57:14.420
with less access
for ordinary people

00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:16.670
to politics and less
social mobility.

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:22.000
There are some very distressing
trends in this country.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.910
When it comes to foreign
policy, however, I'm

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.940
noticing something that
I find kind of curious.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:30.190
And it does refer me back
a little to the Dulles era.

00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:32.310
And it's this.

00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:35.030
Traditionally, on the
spectrum of people

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:37.800
who want to use
American military power

00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.830
and send the Army
every time there's

00:57:39.830 --> 00:57:42.400
trouble somewhere,
the more you believe

00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.050
like that, the more
you're on the right.

00:57:45.050 --> 00:57:47.480
And the more you believe that
the United States shouldn't

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.494
be intervening in other
parts of the world,

00:57:49.494 --> 00:57:50.660
the more you're on the left.

00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.910
I don't think this
is true anymore.

00:57:52.910 --> 00:57:56.290
I think that now there's
a growing consensus

00:57:56.290 --> 00:58:00.000
at different spots around
the political spectrum

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.760
that a humbler,
less promiscuous,

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:07.950
less lustful approach to the
outside world might in the end

00:58:07.950 --> 00:58:10.160
work out better for
the United States.

00:58:10.160 --> 00:58:13.830
We've learned some graphic
lessons in the last few years.

00:58:13.830 --> 00:58:16.005
Again, whether these
lessons are profound

00:58:16.005 --> 00:58:18.800
or whether they just represent
a swing of the pendulum,

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.040
I think remains to be seen.

00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:27.300
But we are at a moment now
when I think a number of people

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:30.490
are beginning to rethink
some fundamental instincts

00:58:30.490 --> 00:58:35.960
about America and wondering if
we protect our security better

00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.020
over the long run by
being less intrusive.

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:41.480
If that's true, maybe
we are coming to an end

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.340
to the Dulles era.

00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.340
And the only thing
the remains will

00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:47.360
be to bring the mural
back to Dulles Airport.

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.470
Thank you.

00:58:48.470 --> 00:58:53.960
