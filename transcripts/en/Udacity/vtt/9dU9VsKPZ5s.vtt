00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.320
&gt;&gt; Okay Michael, so here's the quiz, because you made me

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.630
make it a quiz, I decided to make it even harder, so

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.180
I want you to tell me how many different strategies are

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.810
there for A and how many different strategies there are for B.

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.845
&gt;&gt; And you are talking about just deterministic mappings only, right?

00:00:14.845 --> 00:00:15.857
&gt;&gt; Well, we are in a two player

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:18.980
zero sum, finite, deterministic game of perfect information.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.350
&gt;&gt; So, [LAUGH].

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.710
&gt;&gt; So yes, I mean deterministic.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, alright. because, you know, it could be that it might be helpful

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.360
to be stochastic.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.680
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's true, that's true. So in fact, that's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.140
a good point. I was going to mention that later, but

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.920
l'll mention it now. What I just wrote down here, is

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.989
actually not just a strategy, it's something called a pure strategy.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.730
&gt;&gt; Hm, it's always about purity with you.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.630
&gt;&gt; It is, purity of chocolate and bacon mainly. But, yes. So, these are

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.920
simple pure strategies. Okay, so how many pure strategies are there for A and B.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.140
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.690
&gt;&gt; Okay, then let's go.
