00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.964
So here's the actual definition of Coco
values that we're going to use and

00:00:03.964 --> 00:00:06.030
they come from the [INAUDIBLE] work.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.100
So the coco value of a game is
going to be defined like this.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.320
Let's imagine that we've got a general
sum game with a notation I'm going to

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.390
use is U is the payoff to you and
U bar is the payoff to not you, right?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:19.950
The other person.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that makes sense.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.370
Although I like that you use the bar
because that means complement.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:24.180
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; So you're saying we

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.080
complement each other.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.390
&gt;&gt; This has nothing to do with me.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.330
&gt;&gt; It said you.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.030
&gt;&gt; It has something to
do with you [LAUGH].

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.990
&gt;&gt; Okay, now you're just
confusing me with your pronouns.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.780
&gt;&gt; All right, sorry.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.020
So I should have called
the other matrix I.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.690
No wait, that's not going to help.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.250
All right, so the general sum game that
we're actually solving here is U, U bar.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.520
And why don't we just compute say a nash
equilibrium of that general sum game.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.480
Well there's a bunch of reasons,
one is that they're hard to compute.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.330
Another is that maybe it would
be indifferent to getting

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.860
those extra bananas and
sharing them around.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.600
So what we're going to do is we're
going to define the coco value and

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.110
we're going to use the coco value
to actually divide the spoils.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.270
Here's how the coco values defined,

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.810
we're going to take
the general sum game U, U bar.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.330
And we're going to turn it into sort

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.700
of redistribute all those utilities
that are in those two matrices.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.130
To create two matrices,
one that's purely cooperative and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.670
one that's purely competitive.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.200
We're going to create one game by
thinking about the average values that

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.184
the two of us would get for each of
the different possible joint actions.

00:01:25.184 --> 00:01:26.059
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:01:26.059 --> 00:01:28.630
&gt;&gt; So imagine that we would
just get whatever we get and

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.560
then we split it evenly.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.325
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; All right,

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:31.834
that's very cooperative, right.

00:01:31.834 --> 00:01:32.660
&gt;&gt; It's very cooperative.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.890
&gt;&gt; And in fact mathematically,
it's just U plus U bar over 2,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.348
it becomes the matrix payoff that
we're both going to abide by.

00:01:39.348 --> 00:01:40.220
&gt;&gt; It's injuries more.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.800
&gt;&gt; Purely competitive version is for
us to look at the difference between

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.430
the utilities that we get and
split that in half, right?

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.520
So it ought to be the case that if
we add these two matrices together,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.840
U plus U bar over 2 and
U minus U bar over 2.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.490
What we get U for my perspective,
sorry, from U's perspective.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.915
And we get U bar from
the perspective of the other player.

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:10.530
So we recover those same utilities
from the general sum game.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.305
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:11.305 --> 00:02:14.710
&gt;&gt; But again, we've redistributed
into these two matrices,

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.280
one of which is purely cooperative,
we get the same payoffs.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.787
And the other one is pretty
competitive because one of us

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:22.238
is playing U minus U bar over 2.

00:02:22.238 --> 00:02:25.900
And I was playing the negation of
that which is U bar minus U over 2.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.186
Right, so what's good for you is bad for
the other player and vice-versa.

00:02:30.186 --> 00:02:31.100
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; In particular,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.200
this is zero sum game now.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.434
&gt;&gt; I was actually going to ask what
would happen if you were playing a zero

00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:36.966
sum game?

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:40.042
Then U plus U bar would
always be zero and in fact,

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:42.630
this would say you do
minimax on the gap.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.340
&gt;&gt; U plus U bar would always be zero.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.080
Yeah, once we've redistributed
these into a new U and U bar, yes.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.760
And so right and so

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.940
what's the Nash like thing with
the equilibrium like thing to do

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.350
when we're playing a purely competitive
game and that's to take minimax.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.897
So we're actually going to compute
the minimax value of that game and

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:02.378
we're going to compute
match the max max value.

00:03:02.378 --> 00:03:06.760
In other words, which cell has
the highest sum payoff or average.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.990
If you say sum and average is the same.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.240
Find the cell that has
the largest thing and say okay,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.540
well that is also a Nash equilibrium
of the purely cooperative game.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.700
because if we choose the square that has
the highest payoff out of everything,

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.900
then we're going to have no incentive
to switch to something else.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.900
&gt;&gt; That's right.
&gt;&gt; How do we compute

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.140
the cooperative equilibrium?

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.910
&gt;&gt; You just replace all the things with
their sum and take the biggest one.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.530
&gt;&gt; So it's like taking a max
of all the cells on matrix.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.060
&gt;&gt; A max of all the of the new sales.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.524
&gt;&gt; Of the new meter, that's right.

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:38.689
And what about minimax?

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:40.830
Do you know I remember how to do that?

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.892
&gt;&gt; No, I do, I've tried to
remember which one is which,

00:03:43.892 --> 00:03:46.900
well, let's pretend I don't
remember how to do it.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.510
&gt;&gt; Anything that's not a dynamic
program is a linear program.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.192
&gt;&gt; And truer words never been spoken.

00:03:51.192 --> 00:03:54.298
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Because it's
all about programming.

00:03:54.298 --> 00:03:56.840
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; All right, so in particular, you

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.750
can set this this problem up as a linear
program and solve it in polynomial time.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:01.710
So this is efficient.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.130
At least you know in a formal
mathematical computer science-y

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:06.060
kind of sense.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.878
And so is this.

00:04:06.878 --> 00:04:08.240
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; So we took up a game that we

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.301
actually don't know how to solve because
computing a Nash equilibrium can be

00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:15.100
really hard and
we've broken up into two.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.593
Again, just by redistributing the
wealth, redistributing the utilities.

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:20.060
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
&gt;&gt; We actually split it up into two

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.460
games that are the same amount of
utility is being spread around.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.360
But we can actually compute
the equilibrium value for

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.760
both of them really easily.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.290
And then we're just
going to add them together.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.290
&gt;&gt; Okay, and
then what does it tell us to do?

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.790
&gt;&gt; Good question.
