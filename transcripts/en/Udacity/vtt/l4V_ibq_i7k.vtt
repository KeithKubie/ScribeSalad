00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay--so now we've discussed basic browsers, HTML,

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
HTTP--which is how the browsers talk to the servers--

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and now we're finally going to get to servers,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
which is what most of this course is going to be about--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
how to run programs on servers.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The purpose of a server is to respond to HTTP requests.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
We've drawn this picture a couple of times now.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is you, this is your computer running your browser,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and these are our servers--these little pink boxes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Your browser is speaking HTTP to these servers to request documents.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There are two main classifications for the type of responses a server will do.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
They are called static and dynamic.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Content is considered static if it's a prewritten file

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
that the server just returns.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
An example would be an image--most images are static requests.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
All the server does is it looks up the image off of its hard disk or off of its cache,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and just sends it over the wire using HTTP.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
More interesting requests are dynamic requests.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
These are requests where the response is built on the fly

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
by a program that's running.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Just about all of the content online these days is dynamic.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
That didn't always use to be the case.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
When the Web was first invented in the early 90s,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
almost all of the content online was static.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They were just files.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
People would edit the files, put them on their servers,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
and they all linked to one another, but that was that.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
These days almost every website, including Udacity,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Reddit, and Hipmunk, the 2 websites that I worked on,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Wikipedia, Facebook, all of those pages, almost 100% of them

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
are built dynamically on the fly by programs called web applications.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
And a web application is just a program that generates content,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and that is what we're going to learn how to build in this course.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We've spent all of this time getting to this description of what a web application does,

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
which is it lives on a web server, it speaks HTTP,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and it generates content that your browser requests.
