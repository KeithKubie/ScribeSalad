00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.520
I'm Uta Francke, I'm a human geneticist originally

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.330
from Germany, as you can hear, and I

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.640
am an Emeritus Professor here at Stanford and

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.840
also Senior Medical Director at 23 and me.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.680
&gt;&gt; well thank you very much for being here. we've been talking

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.020
a lot and learning a lot about the genome, what it's made

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.780
of, and right now, we've been focusing on how big it is.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.120
And, We, we've learned that there are about 3 billion base pairs in

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.720
the human genome. And there's a lot of research that's gone on

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.630
for a long time. And we're hoping, you can maybe, shed some

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.230
light on what we know about the research that led to us

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.260
understanding how big the genome is. And sort of, where we are now.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.690
&gt;&gt; You know there were early estimates of the size of

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.960
the genome simply by the, measuring the amount of DNA in

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.220
a cell? People could do that a long time ago, and

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.850
so the estimate was in that range of 3 billion base pairs.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.950
But the idea to actually sequence it was, came up in the mid 80s,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.050
when capillary sequencing was developed, and many people thought it was

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.100
a, absolutely crazy idea, because it's so huge, so much information. And

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.670
it was also known that there was a lot

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.240
of repetitive DNA in it. So people said, is it

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.030
really worth it to, to find the genes that

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.390
are really important in this huge, huge amount of information?

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.160
But then when it was agreed upon to embark on it as an international venture,

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.445
it was also decided that we were not going to do just the human, we also

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:31.150
wanted to do model organisms that people work

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.210
on, in the laboratory. Like the roundworms, the

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.590
fruit fly. And then to compare the human

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.360
and the animal information at the same time.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.980
&gt;&gt; And at that time,

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.010
we already knew that the relative genome sizes of

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.920
these different animals were, were different, at the time, right?

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.580
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that was already known. And, the other thing to know

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.760
about the Human Genome Project, when it finally got started around 1990,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.960
the first five years were devoted to just mapping the chromosomes. You

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.340
know, people heard about chromosomes, and we know that DNA runs in chromosomes

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.380
from one end to another, so it

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.980
would make sense, logical sense, to start sequencing

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.760
at one end and then go through. But instead, what people did, they made maps

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.064
of the chromosomes and then you could focus in on specific region and it was

00:02:22.064 --> 00:02:24.385
a sequencing there. And also to find

00:02:24.385 --> 00:02:27.555
genes that are located on specific chromosome regions.

00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:28.555
&gt;&gt;

00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:27.710
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.240
So, instead of having those sort of, like you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.840
say, sequence from one end to the other, you

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.120
could have many starting places in the middle of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.520
a chromosome and sort of read out from there.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.510
&gt;&gt; Right, and you could relate the sequence to the chromosome and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.490
features because chromosomes, when they are

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.250
treated with a certain agent, display

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.610
banding patterns that are very unique.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.860
Therefore, we can identify each chromosome

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.280
individually, which is something you cannot do when they are uniformly stained,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.620
and also we can see within each chromosome there are

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.510
certain regions. And now we can find out in which

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.930
region certain genes are located. And all of this physical

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.850
mapping, as it's called, was done before the sequencing even started.

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.950
&gt;&gt; So what happened when the sequencing

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.520
project started? You mentioned it was an

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.150
international collaboration. Was this really countries all

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:18.430
over the world, or were they more

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.990
from one region or another?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.180
&gt;&gt; Well there were countries who had developed

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.490
infrastructure to take on such a big project.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.000
And in Europe it was predominantly the UK,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.680
France and Germany. And Canada was a player

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.070
as well as Japan and China. And all

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.780
of these people got together under the, chairmanship

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.810
so to say, of Francis Collins who is

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.260
now the Director of the NIH. He was organizing

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.220
this big international thing and made sure

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.140
there wasn't too much waste and duplication. They

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.320
were dividing up the chromosomes, like here you

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.440
do chromosome 21, okay, that's where we're focusing

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.630
on. And then they had regular meetings.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.150
They exchanged information. All the results were immediately

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.820
shared and put online. And therefore because of

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.600
this international effort this led to success ultimately.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.060
&gt;&gt; And this obviously took a period of, of time. and I

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.670
imagine it sort of was stop and go. At different times. You know how.

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.975
&gt;&gt; Mm-hmm.

00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:20.010
&gt;&gt; How does this fit? You know the, this big initial effort to

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.080
sequence it. as far as a time scale. How long did it take?

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.430
&gt;&gt; Well, we started in 1990. And for the

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.040
first five years they did just mapping. And then

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.530
it was slow to get seriously into sequencing. It

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.770
was estimated that it would be finished in 2005.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.520
But then in the late 90s there was

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.790
also a commercial company called Celera. They said we

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.680
can do this even faster, you guys are

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.740
just too slow. We have better methods. And we

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.690
can chop up the genome in small sequences

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.430
and sequence the small pieces and have the computers

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.753
line it all up and put it together. And

00:04:56.753 --> 00:04:59.950
that's when a serious way started because the companies

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.670
threatened that whatever genes they would discover,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.140
they would patent, and therefore the medical benefits

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.220
would go to them rather than to the

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.310
public. And therefore, in 2000, both of them,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.910
the International Consortium and the company announced

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.730
that they had a draft sequence of the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:22.760
human genome. This draft was very imperfect. It

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:25.800
was full of holes, full of mistakes and

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.800
then the International Consortium spend another three years to finishing it

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.990
up. So, in 2003 then they said, okay, mission accomplished. Here is.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.280
&gt;&gt; You have the, you have a draft.

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.270
Now where are we now with sequencing the human

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.800
genome? Or many human genomes. Are we multiple drafts

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.560
beyond? And are we reaching out to many people.

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.980
&gt;&gt; Yes. See the original genome that was sequenced in the company.

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.050
It was mostly the company CEO Quake Winters

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.620
genome. But the international effort had many different people

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.060
involved. So the genome was a composite of

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.060
sequences of many individuals. And that's called the reference

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.960
genome. But what you really want to know

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.200
is, what is different between the genomes of different

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.990
people who live in different parts of the

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.850
world? And that was the next effort. And to,

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.220
to really sequence individuals was known ethnic background and

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:23.910
find out what are the variations between humans and that's

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.490
when it really became interesting. And that took another

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.980
ten years to become really useful to have that information.

00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:30.480
&gt;&gt;

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:37.230
So, what does the size of a genome mean? Does it mean anything at all?

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:43.240
&gt;&gt; Well there are some organisms with huge genomes, like

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.880
the salamanders, you know? And what is all that sequence, it's probably has no

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.300
information or content. Sometimes genomes get big because viruses get in, and

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:58.930
they replicate. They make copies of themselves. And that has no useful function.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.860
So there is only a smaller part of the genome that's really important because

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.760
it has function. And this is something

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.549
we're still working on unraveling as a function.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:15.090
&gt;&gt; That was beautiful. I think that's all I want to ask about genome size.

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.880
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.690
&gt;&gt; So now, as a natural segue-way,

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:19.620
we're going to pick up into the coding regions.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.650
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.530
&gt;&gt; And I'm going to let you say all of it. I'm just going to try to set

00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:23.860
you up, and then just let you talk

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:25.800
about it, and I'll just ask follow-up questions.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.540
&gt;&gt; You can, you can go back and forth. More, more dialogue

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:28.960
&gt;&gt; Oh, sure.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:29.830
&gt;&gt; Is fine with me.

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.330
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine But you're

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.720
doing a great job talking. So, like telling the story.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.151
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but I don't want to lecture, you know.

00:07:36.151 --> 00:07:36.619
[LAUGH]

00:07:36.619 --> 00:07:39.703
&gt;&gt; But that's okay. I mean, that's sort of the the idea of the interview

00:07:39.703 --> 00:07:40.144
[CROSSTALK]

00:07:40.144 --> 00:07:42.460
even here is. I want you to, to be free

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.310
to tell the story. but I'll definitely ask questions here.

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:45.410
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:45.910
&gt;&gt;

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.430
so, we have 3 billion base pairs, in just one

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.370
copy of the human genome. And we, we've learned that.

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:56.950
You know, we have two copies of the human genome,

00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.440
of the nuclear genome in, in ourselves and we've been

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.830
learning a bit about the coding regions, the protein coding

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.060
regions. what, what can you tell us about the relative

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.990
size of the protein coding regions of the genome versus

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.280
the sort of non-coding regions? this was of course a motivation

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.066
to start it. We want to find out all protein coding

00:08:17.066 --> 00:08:21.590
genes because these are the ones initially considered the most important part.

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:27.490
And as you know, the protein coding genes

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.450
are dividing into exons and introns and only

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:33.620
the exons have the actual information for the

00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:36.730
amino acids. Has this been covered in the course?

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:38.059
&gt;&gt;

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:38.480
&gt;&gt; Yesterday.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:39.289
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.730
&gt;&gt; Well, hold on, actually, hold on, let me, let me think for a second.

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:42.730
&gt;&gt;

00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:41.924
[CROSSTALK]

00:08:41.924 --> 00:08:43.059
&gt;&gt; No, this is lesson three.

00:08:43.059 --> 00:08:47.760
&gt;&gt; Okay, okay, so we don't know that yet. Okay, so the big question was

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.500
how many protein coding genes are there in

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.460
the genome. And initially, before the genome project

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:54.520
[INAUDIBLE].

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.680
The number that's been kicked around was, like, a 100,000.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:56.890
&gt;&gt; Mm hm.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.660
&gt;&gt; Sort of a wild guess. And then, between 2000 and

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:05.760
2003, there was an official betting game going on. Where people

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.280
could put down a dollar and a number. And then, years

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:12.179
later, it was $5, and then it was $20. Because it

00:09:12.179 --> 00:09:12.548
[INAUDIBLE]

00:09:12.548 --> 00:09:15.830
became more difficult. And everybody could only put

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.690
down one bet. About 150 people put down a

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:22.110
bet. And their range, the ranges of their guesses

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:27.250
went from, you wouldn't believe it. 25,000 to 150,000.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:27.587
&gt;&gt; Wow.

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:31.190
&gt;&gt; So nobody had really any good idea. The mean was

00:09:31.190 --> 00:09:37.770
around 61,000 genes. And when the first draft was published, they said,

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:43.010
why, we had a brief look at it, and we think it's within 30 and 35,000. And when

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:47.960
it was finally finished, the number had come down to 20 to 25,000. And

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.910
many people were surprised, because this is hardly

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:53.830
any more than the roundworm, or the fruit

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:56.550
fly. So the humans are so much more

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.440
complex. Shouldn't they have more protein coding genes?

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.240
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.090
&gt;&gt; But there was a mechanism.

00:10:03.090 --> 00:10:05.510
How you can make many proteins from one

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:08.940
gene. And this is called alternative splicing. You are

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.240
going to get to this later in the course.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.510
That means you can take bits and pieces from

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.740
one gene and you put them together differently,

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:21.650
and then they encode different proteins. So the complexity

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.900
cannot be immediately, deduced from the number of genes

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.220
when you don't know what these, these genes can

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.130
be used for.

00:10:29.130 --> 00:10:30.740
&gt;&gt; What percentage of the genome is

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.280
actually made up of coding region, roughly?

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.900
&gt;&gt; It's only 1 to 2%. And, so all this other,

00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:40.660
you know, 90, 98% to 99% then, I mean, a lot

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:43.720
of people who, you know, are just learning about the genome

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.230
may be wondering, what exactly is the rest of that sequence doing?

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.730
&gt;&gt; You see, originally people thought it was just junk!

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:54.460
It was just a virus getting in and replicating itself.

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.420
And in recent years, people started to look. At how much of that sequence is

00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:03.910
being made into RNA? How much is being transcribed? And to everyone's surprise,

00:11:03.910 --> 00:11:09.260
more than 80% is actually made into a copy of RNA. And these

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.570
RNAs have all kinds of interesting functions. For example, to

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.770
regulate activity of other genes. To regulate the activity

00:11:19.770 --> 00:11:21.950
of messenger RNAs, how they are being

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:27.090
translated, and many different functions that they always

00:11:27.090 --> 00:11:29.346
have. Some of them are structural, I mean,

00:11:29.346 --> 00:11:31.929
there are RNAs that has structural components of

00:11:31.929 --> 00:11:32.530
[UNKNOWN].

00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.140
And otherwise, outside of the coding sequence, there are control

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:41.790
regions that are important to regulate the activity of each gene.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.960
&gt;&gt; I see. So, we learn in this lesson

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.330
about messenger RNA, mRNA. And so what you're saying,

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.240
there are actually other kinds of RNAs that can

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.880
be made besides mRNA that doesn't get turned into protein?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.860
&gt;&gt; That's right. And what was found out

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.210
recently, that you remember, there are two strands in

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:01.130
the DNA, and the messenger RNA's only made

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:03.984
of one strand, that gives the formation for the

00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:06.990
protein. But what is being found out now is

00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:10.740
that there are antisense RNAs, that actually other strand

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:13.120
of DNA can also be made into RNA. It

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.470
goes in the opposite direction. It has no coding

00:12:16.470 --> 00:12:20.840
function for proteins, usually not, sometimes it does. But

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.220
it has regulatory function. And you just can't imagine

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.600
if a gene is transcribed in the other direction, then

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.920
the transcription of the messenger RNA has a problem, you know.

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.232
It runs into, it's a train wreck, quite So there's a

00:12:34.232 --> 00:12:38.538
regulation of gene activity by anti sense RNAs. That's one mechanism.

00:12:38.538 --> 00:12:40.714
&gt;&gt; Right, so it sounds like, maybe some of

00:12:40.714 --> 00:12:44.362
the complexity of different species or the complexity of cells

00:12:44.362 --> 00:12:46.410
is in, part not so much the, the share

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:50.080
of content the number of genes you have, but maybe.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.590
How you regulate all of those genes together to, to create something.

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:59.820
&gt;&gt; What we are finding out now is that the genomic regions communicate

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:05.110
with each other. Like you can have an enhancer region that is downstream away

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:09.930
from the gene, or even in an intron of another gene. But then folds over,

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:16.090
communicates with the promoter, and sets in motion the messenger RNA synthesis.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.260
So the whole genome is three-dimensional, it's

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:22.270
not just one dimensional series of letters. It

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:25.004
is a lot of. Three dimensional arrangement

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:28.480
and interaction that's very important for its function.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.260
&gt;&gt; We'll actually talk a lot, or a little bit

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:33.940
more about that in lesson four, hopefully. You mentioned axon

00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:38.290
and entrons which are part of mRNAs, and the axons

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:41.150
are the coding regions. The actual parts that get turned into

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:46.410
protein and we seem to have, learned in our little time spent with the material

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:51.250
that the exon seem much smaller in general than the introns. The introns seem

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:56.080
to be very big a lot of times. do we know anything about the,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.170
the size of exons and introns and sort of. How or why that, that exists?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:06.070
&gt;&gt; There was a huge variation in the intron size. Some can be very small,

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:14.250
and some can be absolutely huge. And we don't know exactly why that is. The last

00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:20.470
exon is usually larger than the other exons because it contains. The signatures

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.640
stop, and then it's the untranslated region,

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.980
which is important for regulatory purposes. And, introns

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.360
in the middle of the gene, they can be tiny, or can be bigger, and

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.640
we don't know exactly, I don't understand why it evolved this way.

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.340
&gt;&gt; So, what are we still learning, in

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.130
general, about the genome, and the coding, and

00:14:40.130 --> 00:14:43.600
the non-coding regions? are there any. Really important

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:47.530
concepts or new findings that you think are

00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:49.910
really interesting that we're learning about, either the

00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:52.030
size of the genome or not so much

00:14:52.030 --> 00:14:54.350
the size but the number of coding regions,

00:14:54.350 --> 00:14:56.180
the amount of coding region, how it interacts.

00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:59.420
&gt;&gt; What

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.330
we're learning about the genome is more about

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:04.370
the function of the non-coding regions. You know,

00:15:04.370 --> 00:15:07.740
there are, for example, small nuclear RNAs. These

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.580
are small RNAs that are part of a, part

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.733
of the nucleus that are encoded in intron.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.643
And they are encoded in intron. When the

00:15:17.643 --> 00:15:20.679
intron is degraded, these little RNAs are released

00:15:20.679 --> 00:15:24.400
and they have very important functions in the body.

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.091
And this was found out like, every research we

00:15:27.091 --> 00:15:29.713
did in our lab, when we compared the human and

00:15:29.713 --> 00:15:33.150
the mouse. The exon sequences did not code for protein,

00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:36.190
and they were not at all conserved. And the intron

00:15:36.190 --> 00:15:39.840
sequences were conserved, because that's where the functional units are

00:15:39.840 --> 00:15:42.860
located. So there're all kind of surprises. You know, you

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.690
shouldn't only think the exon's important, the intron is junk

00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:49.110
and gets thrown away. Now it can be the opposite.

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.540
&gt;&gt; you

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:53.650
also mentioned repetitive DNA when you were talking about some of I guess

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:57.810
the historical context of the genome and even once we sequenced it. If

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:00.780
anyone does any research on their own they might find that there's still

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:04.532
a lot of repetitive regions. What do we know about those in the genome?

00:16:04.532 --> 00:16:09.470
&gt;&gt; in most of them are just remnants, I mean they were copies made of

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:12.270
some early viral intruder and now they are

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:15.190
degenerated. They are bits and pieces of them,

00:16:15.190 --> 00:16:18.130
but there were still some active copies, and what

00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:20.260
they can do, they can still make copies of

00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:23.500
themselves, and they can jump around and insert someplace

00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:27.040
else in the genome. And actually cause problems. They can

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.650
cause disease by inserting into an important protein coding

00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:33.720
genes. So we are not done with dealing with

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.590
all these repetitive sequences. They're still changing, and that

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.530
means there is huge variability from one person to another,

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:40.940
as well.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:44.470
&gt;&gt; I think that's an amazing concept, too, to think about our genomes.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.120
We sort of think of them as, okay, we have this static genome.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.340
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:50.030
&gt;&gt; And it may interact with itself to create a protein, or

00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:55.786
regulation, but. The genome itself is changing even today, like you said, these

00:16:55.786 --> 00:16:56.130
[CROSSTALK]

00:16:56.130 --> 00:16:56.500
moving elements.
&gt;&gt;

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:56.860
[CROSSTALK]

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.280
It's still evolving.

00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.940
&gt;&gt; Well, what of I just maybe, oh, so,

00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:04.250
when people talk about variation in the human genome.

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.288
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:17:04.288 --> 00:17:08.829
&gt;&gt; We often times talk about single nucleotide variants, which we'll come

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:13.599
to in, in later lessons for, for our course. Is that the main

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.950
kind of variation that exists in the human genome, are these single

00:17:16.950 --> 00:17:18.319
letter differences, or there are other

00:17:18.319 --> 00:17:20.690
kinds of variations that are important too?

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.280
&gt;&gt; We have identified

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.790
about 15 million single letter differences, so by

00:17:25.790 --> 00:17:28.880
sheer number, they are the most common. But then

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.890
there are other varients, they are called copy

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.980
number variations. Where whole chunks of the genome can

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:37.752
be repeated, and they can be present in

00:17:37.752 --> 00:17:41.600
these two, three or many copies. And there are

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.980
differences between human beings. So some people have

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:46.990
two copies, some have five, some may have 12.

00:17:46.990 --> 00:17:49.430
And if you look at the total number

00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:52.820
of nucleotides involved in those. Then this is

00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.550
more common. So the individual copy number variance

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.040
or CNV.'s are fewer than the ones we have

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.750
identified for SNVs. But if you look at

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.680
the amount of genomic sequence and worked in this

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.340
type of what's called structural variation it, it

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:12.080
involves the larger part of the genome. I see,

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.572
so between single nucleotide variance and copy number variation.

00:18:17.572 --> 00:18:22.800
those are the two main kinds, or the two main forms of variations in humans.

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.935
&gt;&gt; Yeah, then there are others like inversions where certain pieces of

00:18:25.935 --> 00:18:29.210
the genome can be turned around and some people and not in others.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:34.840
&gt;&gt; And even Translocations? How viable are

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.480
translocations, and do they get propagated at

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.340
all in a population over time, or are most translocations inviable?

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:43.750
&gt;&gt; Well, we find them in families. You

00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:46.580
know, there are balanced translocations, where a piece

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.530
of a chromosome is taken off and hooked

00:18:48.530 --> 00:18:52.230
somewhere else, or two pieces have been exchanged. And

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.330
as long as they are balanced meaning that

00:18:54.330 --> 00:18:57.530
the right number of genes is there, people are

00:18:57.530 --> 00:18:59.840
fine. They wouldn't know about it, unless a

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.920
break is in a gene but that's pretty unusual.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.130
The break is most often in a repetitive

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.560
sequence. But then when these people may have

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.760
children because of what happens in myosis, the

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:15.630
chromosomes align and cross over. It's possible that a

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:18.370
child inherits a chromosome that only has an

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:21.340
extra copy, and does then get the other one

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.170
that's missing something. Then you have an unbalanced

00:19:24.170 --> 00:19:28.940
translocation, and that can cause very bad developmental defects

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:33.380
intellectual, def, deficits. These are the children who we see in

00:19:33.380 --> 00:19:37.060
the clinic, and we look at their chromosomes. And look at

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:40.170
their parents and we see that translocation has been passed on

00:19:40.170 --> 00:19:44.520
through several generations already. But otherwise

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.870
they don't last in, in population.

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:49.850
&gt;&gt; Well, you were just touching on something that I want to us to

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.970
move on and talk about for lesson 12 now. I want to know a bit

00:19:53.970 --> 00:19:56.170
more about your background and your experience. You

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:59.260
have a lot of experience with human genetics and

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:02.680
both in research but also clinically. looking at

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:07.570
families and individuals with various phenotypes. I'd like for

00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:09.080
you to start maybe tell us when you

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.650
first fell in love with genetics and when you

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.270
started studying and sort of your journey to where

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.250
you are today as a, as a Stanford professor.

00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:19.720
&gt;&gt; I went to medical school in Germany,

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.410
and then I trained in pediatrics. I came to this country to train at Los

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:27.580
Angeles Children's Hospital. And then I had to think about what else to do, and

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.200
what I really wanted to do was

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.650
endocrinology because I love biochemistry. I thought biochemistry

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:38.195
was the best thing in medical school. But I couldn't get in as a foreign medical

00:20:38.195 --> 00:20:38.380
[INAUDIBLE].

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.080
And genetics was just in the beginning, starting

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.700
to get interesting. It was at the time

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.630
where it became possible to identify chromosomes by

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:50.560
chromosome banding. And there weren't many people going

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:54.030
into that field. Which had a great advantage

00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:57.040
because as a fellow at UCLA in human

00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.240
genetics I was allowed to do anything. I

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.920
could learn chromosomes, biochemical genetics as well as see

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.780
the patients on the wards where people said, oh what

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.420
is this my formation, is it a syndrome, is it genetic,

00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:14.590
will it happen again? So the training involved from the beginning,

00:21:14.590 --> 00:21:18.088
clinical genetics and then as a sub sub specialties of genetics.

00:21:18.088 --> 00:21:19.687
[CROSSTALK]

00:21:19.687 --> 00:21:23.650
&gt;&gt; Well, I was going to say so did you, were you able to interact

00:21:23.650 --> 00:21:28.010
in, in, in, I guess, medical school and beyond as you were sort of discovering

00:21:28.010 --> 00:21:34.110
the area that you were sort of going to focus on for, for genetics. At

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:39.190
the same time were you able to experience the clinical side of genetics as well?

00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:41.590
&gt;&gt; All the time. I was active in

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:45.340
clinical genetics for the last 30 something years.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.250
&gt;&gt; And what does that involve exactly?

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:51.950
&gt;&gt; Well, in pediatrics you're mostly focused

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.500
on children having problems. So either children

00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.510
who inherit something. Or children who get

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.270
very sick after they are born, because

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.080
they cannot metabolize protein, there's something wrong

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:05.180
in their metabolism. Or children who have

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:08.270
certain birth defects, children who don't do

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:10.520
well in school, who are late walking,

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.710
who are late aquiring skills or have

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:17.530
neurological symptoms. Seizures. So all kinds of problems

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:21.570
that people didn't know, what is this? So there was a lot of discovery to

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:24.920
do. We found out that certain clinical

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.310
phenotypes were associated with chromosomal duplications or deletions,

00:22:29.310 --> 00:22:31.190
now that we could look at chromosomes in

00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:33.563
higher resolution. So that was a first stage

00:22:33.563 --> 00:22:34.150
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:34.150 --> 00:22:37.520
or in the 70s, make discoveries this way.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.870
And now, of course, whole genome sequencing is

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.950
applied to these children. And when nobody had,

00:22:43.950 --> 00:22:46.610
could figure out what caused their problem, you look

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:48.890
at the whole sequence, and you can find

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.390
a change. And that's been very successful in the

00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:54.690
last couple years. Since high, high throughput sequencing

00:22:54.690 --> 00:22:59.280
methods were developed. So, the exiting thing about my

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:03.000
own career is a two-way street. It's always been

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.270
two ways between the clinic and the laboratory. You see

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:10.060
somebody fascinating in the clinic, and you bring samples to

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:12.960
the lab, and you tell your PhDs. Look this is

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.980
what the patients look like and we have to

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:17.530
figure out what's going on here, and that gets everybody

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:21.180
motivated. When you learn something in the lab, you find

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:24.440
a gene like we found a gene for Rett Syndrome.

00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.060
And then you can figure out, can we do anything to help these patients now

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:32.610
that we have the gene. We figure out it's function. In the last few years, we

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:34.240
spent a lot of time making mouse

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.820
models, because we looked at diseases that involved

00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:39.870
the central nervous system, and you can't go

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.910
into a human brain and take a sample.

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.226
&gt;&gt; I'm sure there are many ethical concerns there.

00:23:44.226 --> 00:23:47.060
&gt;&gt; I mean some people have part of

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.950
the brain removed because of some medical indication, and

00:23:49.950 --> 00:23:52.890
then of course you can get it, but what

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:56.420
we did make mouse models, because the genome is

00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:59.890
very conserved between the human and the mouse. And,

00:23:59.890 --> 00:24:02.860
even though we're working with deletion syndromes, where part of

00:24:02.860 --> 00:24:06.130
a chromosome is missing, we can define where in

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.270
the mouse genome that part is located. It's got the

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:11.580
same genes in it. Take it out in the

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.420
mouse, and then you have mice that you can study

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:17.490
the development, prenatally.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:17.683
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:24:17.683 --> 00:24:21.660
&gt;&gt; Afterwards, take the brain, cut it up, look at what's going

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.605
on, and this is what we did mostly in, while in this millennium

00:24:26.605 --> 00:24:26.997
[LAUGH]

00:24:26.997 --> 00:24:27.394
I would say.
&gt;&gt;

00:24:27.394 --> 00:24:27.800
[LAUGH]

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.040
Well, it sounds like, I mean this is good,

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:33.430
good old-fashioned science. Really good science. And, to people who

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.690
aren't familiar, it sounds like detective work. You, you

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.620
sort of establish what you see. You make an observation

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:38.710
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:42.840
&gt;&gt; And then you go investigate. I'm, I'm really struck by, even

00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:46.190
still, by the idea that the human and the mouse phenome are similar

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:49.270
enough that you're even able to do that. Can you speak for a

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.700
second about, you know, working in

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.470
genetics, especially with human genetics, where there

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:52.910
&gt;&gt; Mm hmm
&gt;&gt; Are so many

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:58.340
limitations, about the constraints, but also the tools you

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:01.900
have to answer certain questions, for people who may

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.580
not be familiar with the idea that the mouse

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:06.180
and the human genome are in fact quite similar.

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:12.260
&gt;&gt; Well, the mouse is such a useful organism because mouse genetics

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.060
has developed parallel to human genetics.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:18.320
And many mutations and phenotypes were spontaneously

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.660
already detected in the mouse, so you already

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.490
knew there was a mouse model for this disease,

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:26.150
and you could go and study it right away.

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.570
And for those where they did not arrive spontaneously,

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:32.130
the mouse is ideal because you can manipulate

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:36.430
the embryonic stem cells. You could introduce mutations in

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:38.731
the mouse that you know exist in the human.

00:25:38.731 --> 00:25:41.745
Therefore you make a mouse model that exactly replicates,

00:25:41.745 --> 00:25:45.470
biochemically what's in the human. The mice

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.160
don't always have the same phenotypes, obviously,

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.950
because they have a much smaller brain

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:53.850
and many other differences. Right, but they're similar

00:25:53.850 --> 00:25:55.540
enough that when you look at those

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:58.680
differences or the what happens when you change

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.220
the genetics of the mouse you can then adapt that back to the clinic sometimes.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.750
&gt;&gt; Well sure. You can also use the mouse to

00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.030
try out any drugs that you may come up with.

00:26:07.030 --> 00:26:09.690
Any ideas you have for treatment, you can give it

00:26:09.690 --> 00:26:12.600
to the mouse and see whether there is an effect.

00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:13.100
&gt;&gt;

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.640
So, in, in, in your time, in your

00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.430
clinical and, and research experience, what what area

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:26.600
did you focus on more specifically? What, what

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.519
would you say is your, your general research subject?

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:35.030
&gt;&gt; There were too many to mention. I really

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:38.800
started out with whatever was possible to do at the

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.160
time. You know, I was, in a way, driven

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.960
by technology that was being developed, and I saw where

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:47.060
this technology could be applied to the

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.480
problem. So it started with cytogenetics. In the

00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.700
area of banding chromosomes, that was in

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:58.430
the 70's. And then biochemical genetics, somatic cell

00:26:58.430 --> 00:27:00.720
genetics, meaning that you can fuse cells

00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:05.420
from different organisms and you can. Map chromosomes.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.260
So in the beginning of the genome project,

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.050
we were very much invested in mapping genes

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.510
to chromosomal regions. With the idea, if you have a gene that's been

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.990
cloned, and you know the function, you map it to a chromosome region, where

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:23.080
we already know a certain disease gene has been mapped. Then becomes a candidate

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.000
gene for this disease. And that was a useful approach in the early 90s.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.840
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.020
&gt;&gt; And then, as all these other technologies

00:27:32.020 --> 00:27:35.540
became available to study global gene expression patterns and

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.870
doing mouse modeling, and we, then we moved to

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:44.668
studying individual diseases, like Rett Syndrome. And Roberts Syndrome,

00:27:44.668 --> 00:27:45.904
[UNKNOWN]

00:27:45.904 --> 00:27:50.290
Syndrome and ultimately I thought the deletion syndromes

00:27:50.290 --> 00:27:52.640
where you take out a chunk of chromosome,

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.950
and would be interesting because there are many

00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:57.740
different genes in there, and which of these genes

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.360
contribute to what part of the phenotype? I

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.900
found that fascinating. And that's, Was the project we

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:07.420
were working on in the end. So it's

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.070
a step wise process of discovery that makes use

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:14.920
of the technology as it is being developed.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.910
So you can say it's opportunistic. Yes, it

00:28:16.910 --> 00:28:20.350
is. Ultimately my goal was always to find

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.050
some treatment for some of these genetic diseases

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:29.710
that we see in the clinic. What was one of your most exciting or fun discoveries

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:35.360
in research, or in the clinic. Do you have a favorite idea or time or story?

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:37.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah the most exciting was this

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:44.220
new RNA, this small nuclear RNA that are in introns. Because this is a syndrome

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.990
called Prader–Willi syndrome. And what it looks

00:28:46.990 --> 00:28:49.660
like is that children are born very floppy

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:53.760
and very difficult to feed. And what

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.730
happens after a while, they get stronger and

00:28:56.730 --> 00:28:58.650
they start eating, and everybody is happy.

00:28:58.650 --> 00:29:02.670
Finally, Jimmy eats his food. And they start

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:05.530
eating too much. And they become massively obese, if

00:29:05.530 --> 00:29:08.590
you don't watch it, in no time. So the

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.530
problem was, what is going on with these children?

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:14.860
And we, we tried to make a mouse to

00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:17.970
find out the deletion was quite large, four and

00:29:17.970 --> 00:29:21.280
a half megabases, several genes in it. And we

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:24.680
found out there's many different things I can't explain

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:27.505
in this short time. But that it's actually the

00:29:27.505 --> 00:29:28.540
[UNKNOWN]

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.270
that is responsible. We made a mouse model, taking out just the

00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:32.704
[UNKNOWN]

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:37.270
from the introns. And these mice, they don't get obese, but they

00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:41.220
don't stop eating. So it's the signal that tells you, I had enough.

00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:47.120
It's a satiety signal. That's missing. The children, they don't eat very

00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.570
fast. They just keep eating, keep eating. The mice do the same thing.

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.390
&gt;&gt; So you were able to essentially

00:29:52.390 --> 00:29:54.870
sort of discover the genetic underpinning of that.

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:55.210
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.790
&gt;&gt; Is there any treatment that

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:00.520
you were able to do anything with from medicine?

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.510
&gt;&gt; Many people are now working on this.

00:30:02.510 --> 00:30:04.740
We made the mice. We let them, we distribute

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.960
them to everybody who works on obesity. I mean,

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.275
you can imagine If you figure out how this

00:30:09.275 --> 00:30:09.510
[UNKNOWN]

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:12.110
is. What are the genes they are actually

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.845
regulating? What are the mechanisms of action for the

00:30:14.845 --> 00:30:16.240
[UNKNOWN]?

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.340
We don't know that yet. And so we hope

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.530
that ultimately a treatment will come out not only

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:25.140
for this rare condition called Prader Willi Syndrome, but

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:29.220
maybe for people who have a problem with appetite.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:30.770
[INAUDIBLE].

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:31.720
&gt;&gt; What do you think is the most

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.240
difficult part of your research that you've done,

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.830
in general speaking, for maybe, research in general?

00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:39.860
What do you think is the most difficult part?

00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:45.584
&gt;&gt; Okay, not technologically difficult but in terms of managing

00:30:45.584 --> 00:30:50.510
and handling. Yeah. The most difficult part is if you

00:30:50.510 --> 00:30:55.800
feel you get unfair reviews, if there is competition with things going on

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.420
in the background. You know, reviews of papers and

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:03.040
grants are anonymous. And so you sometimes get reviews back

00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:06.220
that you think are totally unfair. And there's nothing

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.670
you can do. You don't know, who's shooting from where.

00:31:09.670 --> 00:31:10.202
&gt;&gt; Right,

00:31:10.202 --> 00:31:11.051
[INAUDIBLE].

00:31:11.051 --> 00:31:16.100
&gt;&gt; So that is the hardest part. Collaborations with people you know, you

00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:20.120
can manage. You know, you can, sometimes they go sour, but at least

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.780
you know the person. You can sit down and say, hey, let's straighten

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:25.920
this out. We had a difference and now we are friends again, right?

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:26.925
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:31:26.925 --> 00:31:27.740
[LAUGH]

00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:33.440
&gt;&gt; And, if it's anonymous, You don't can only defend yourself.

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.840
&gt;&gt; Sort of off camera or on camera, I know

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.540
there are a lot of people who are pushing for

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:43.150
to make peer review not anonymous because.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:43.660
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:45.910
&gt;&gt; They want it to be, so that you can actually, you

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:48.740
know call someone else and say, hey. That wasn't a far review.

00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.230
&gt;&gt; It, it, it's much more constructive.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.530
&gt;&gt; So for example, I worked for a journal called Peer J. Peer, P, E, E, R, J.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:32:00.830
It's an open access journal. Where the people who agree to review,

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:05.900
agree to make it, make themselves known. And then the whole correspondence

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.770
between the reviewers and the original manuscript. And

00:32:08.770 --> 00:32:12.850
then the revision and everything is going to be online.

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:15.320
So people can actually learn what happened during this

00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.730
review. And how did this reviewer improved the paper?

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:19.050
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:24.010
&gt;&gt; So the reviews you get back are. Really constructive, they give you

00:32:24.010 --> 00:32:26.800
all kinds of good ideas, what else you can do to make it better.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:31.440
&gt;&gt; Right. so does thinking about what

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:35.490
you do as a career what do you think the future is for people who

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:38.980
are interested in being clinicians, and bridging the

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:43.060
gap between you know, people and the research

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:48.420
that can help them? Do you think there's going to be a. A bigger opening in,

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:51.910
in the future for people who want to do something similar to, to what you do?

00:32:51.910 --> 00:32:56.590
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. While there was definitely a need, and there are many opportunities.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:32:59.460
But the drawbacks are, in genetics for example,

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:03.530
we don't have enough people coming into medical genetics

00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:06.670
out of the medicine side. Because, in genetics, you

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:09.504
don't make any money. We don't have procedures. We

00:33:09.504 --> 00:33:11.849
don't stick tubes into people that we can

00:33:11.849 --> 00:33:14.940
charge for. It's all cognitive. You know, you spend

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:18.340
a lot of time going through complicated information. Searching

00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:20.900
the literature. Sitting down with the family counseling room.

00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:24.290
You don't get reimbursed much for this.

00:33:24.290 --> 00:33:24.890
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:28.020
&gt;&gt; And therefore it's not attractive, not if, not for people who went

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.930
to American Medical Schools and to enter a career as a medical geneticist.

00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:38.200
So we have a shortage and many of the most successful people are

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.198
foreign trained. Medical, medical doctors who

00:33:41.198 --> 00:33:44.000
don't have pay for their medical education.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.010
&gt;&gt; We hopefully have a real large international audience you

00:33:48.010 --> 00:33:50.460
know, participating in our course. What would you say to a

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:54.410
student or in a lifetime learner who's watching and is really

00:33:54.410 --> 00:33:57.190
interested in the subject, and they'd even be interested in thinking

00:33:57.190 --> 00:33:59.330
about this as a career. What advice would you give them?

00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.950
&gt;&gt; I mean, I can only say this has been a lifetime

00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:06.030
learning experience to be part of genetics during those decades when everything

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:09.830
developed and we are not done yet. I think it goes on

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:13.139
and will be even more exciting. There are many secrets in the

00:34:13.139 --> 00:34:16.550
genome that are yet to be unraveled. And

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:20.940
both PhDs and MDs should consider this. And then

00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:24.340
genetic counseling, that's a whole new career path. We

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:27.130
have a training program here at Stanford for genetic

00:34:27.130 --> 00:34:30.810
counselors, the masters program. Because you don't have

00:34:30.810 --> 00:34:33.190
to have a PhD or an MD to tell

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.590
people, this is what we found in your sequence,

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:38.260
and this is what it means. And these people

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.230
are trained specifically to do that. And we'll need a ton of them. Lots

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:45.820
of them. So I want to encourage people to consider this as a career.

00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.429
&gt;&gt; Great.

00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:51.830
that's all the questions I have. Do you

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:54.300
want to talk about your affiliation with 23 and

00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:59.904
me at all? Or do you want to just, sort of, leave it as the Stanford connection.

00:34:59.904 --> 00:35:02.320
&gt;&gt; I think I'd rather do this as a Stanford now. Uh-huh.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:05.917
&gt;&gt; Let's do that. Well, I'll open up to you, is there

00:35:05.917 --> 00:35:09.622
anything else, either about the genome subjects or about, you know, doing

00:35:09.622 --> 00:35:10.135
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:10.135 --> 00:35:11.240
genetics research.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:11.972
&gt;&gt; If you ask me on

00:35:11.972 --> 00:35:12.399
[UNKNOWN]

00:35:12.399 --> 00:35:15.083
that would be another half an hour because as a lot's

00:35:15.083 --> 00:35:17.645
going on at 23 and me, I find exciting and why did

00:35:17.645 --> 00:35:20.207
I decide to work with them and how long have I worked

00:35:20.207 --> 00:35:23.620
with them and so. Should, you know, want a part of this.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:25.480
&gt;&gt; Is there anything else about the genome or the

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.460
genome size? Anything I'd love to know, like when you teach

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.300
genetics in the classroom. What do you, what do you say

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.381
to students to get them excited about, genetics and the genome.

00:35:35.381 --> 00:35:37.948
&gt;&gt; what student,

00:35:37.948 --> 00:35:46.000
what students find exciting is often the applied part. You

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.650
know bioengineering. Now that we find out the things about plants and, and what

00:35:51.650 --> 00:35:57.205
can we do to improve food supply for the world, bio genetic, bio, bio, engineo

00:35:57.205 --> 00:36:03.044
genetic, bioengineering. And also making models for diseases. This is

00:36:03.044 --> 00:36:04.644
the mice I just used as a matter

00:36:04.644 --> 00:36:09.050
of convenience because they're already genetically well studied organisms.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.710
The smallest mammal. But you would much rather

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:15.590
have larger organisms, and now they're being able to

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:21.682
make whole organs of the pig, for example. In, in vitro more or less. I mean all

00:36:21.682 --> 00:36:25.800
of this development are exciting. So I talk about

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.960
induced pro importance stem cells. How you can make.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:31.345
Different set types and organs from

00:36:31.345 --> 00:36:33.050
[UNKNOWN],

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:37.230
and how you can study diseases in a dish, you know, if the patient was

00:36:37.230 --> 00:36:39.160
Parkinson's disease, we can take a skin

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.350
biopsy, make the cells into neurons, and then

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.020
study the mechanism that, in the brain,

00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.130
gives these people Parkinson's disease. And those other

00:36:49.130 --> 00:36:52.960
side of the genome itself, I talk

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:56.206
about repetitive sequences and they find this boring.

00:36:56.206 --> 00:36:57.016
[LAUGH]

00:36:57.016 --> 00:36:58.016
&gt;&gt;

00:36:57.016 --> 00:36:57.838
[LAUGH]

00:36:57.838 --> 00:37:02.530
That's exciting. yeah I was going to say, I

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:04.900
find that the, the evolution of the genome itself

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.830
is just fascinating, and I'm really intrigued by how

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.690
people use genetic information to look back in time.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.500
to sort of look at connections, my, I, the lab I,

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:19.910
in undergrad I worked in a yeast, a yeast lab, and

00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:25.540
was really interested in the bio-genetics of specifically the

00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:31.500
RNA, the C-terminal domain of RNA plurase two, it's very conserved, from yeast.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.781
&gt;&gt; You know there's no RNAs

00:37:32.781 --> 00:37:33.208
[UNKNOWN]

00:37:33.208 --> 00:37:34.151
have it already.

00:37:34.151 --> 00:37:35.159
[CROSSTALK]

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:39.129
Yeah, these are ancient. You know, there

00:37:39.129 --> 00:37:43.630
wasn't RNA world before DNA even came in existence.

00:37:43.630 --> 00:37:49.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know, it's fascinating, and I think maybe something,

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:54.780
I do want to get this on camera. as a geneticist, human or otherwise,

00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:01.160
how do you know something's important? Is it the fact that you see it conserved

00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:05.730
in many different species? Or is there something else that, that goes

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:09.699
on that tells you, okay this sequence or this event is really important?

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:12.030
&gt;&gt;

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.516
[INAUDIBLE]

00:38:11.516 --> 00:38:14.417
Finds what you think is important. If you're

00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:17.921
interested in the evolution, then anything that traces

00:38:17.921 --> 00:38:20.403
back to a lower organism and is conserved

00:38:20.403 --> 00:38:24.130
is, is interesting. Or changes through evolution are

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.410
interesting, because then you can understand the underpinning

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:30.040
of evolution. But if you want to find

00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:32.590
out what makes humans so special. Why do

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:36.985
we have language? Why do we have ethical considerations?

00:38:36.985 --> 00:38:39.860
Then you look for something that you only find in humans and

00:38:39.860 --> 00:38:44.599
not in, in other organisms. So it depends what's interesting to you?

00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:54.599
[BLANK_AUDIO]
