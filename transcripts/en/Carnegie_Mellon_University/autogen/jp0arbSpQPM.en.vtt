sophisticated way so once we have these
new technologies and we have all this

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:53.480
new technologies and we have all this
 

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.360
new technologies and we have all this
data we have all these algorithms we

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:55.370
data we have all these algorithms we
 

00:22:55.370 --> 00:22:56.530
data we have all these algorithms we
also think it's going to be very

00:22:56.530 --> 00:22:56.540
also think it's going to be very
 

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.450
also think it's going to be very
important to aggregate and analyze these

00:22:58.450 --> 00:22:58.460
important to aggregate and analyze these
 

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.940
important to aggregate and analyze these
massive data sets of brain and behavior

00:23:00.940 --> 00:23:00.950
massive data sets of brain and behavior
 

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:03.910
massive data sets of brain and behavior
and the partnerships especially with

00:23:03.910 --> 00:23:03.920
and the partnerships especially with
 

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:05.560
and the partnerships especially with
well with with all of the partners that

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:05.570
well with with all of the partners that
 

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:08.350
well with with all of the partners that
we've been talking to will will provide

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360
we've been talking to will will provide
 

00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.570
we've been talking to will will provide
us incredible access to some of these

00:23:10.570 --> 00:23:10.580
us incredible access to some of these
 

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:12.910
us incredible access to some of these
data sources whether it be data sources

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:12.920
data sources whether it be data sources
 

00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.550
data sources whether it be data sources
on autistic individuals at suny at sin

00:23:15.550 --> 00:23:15.560
on autistic individuals at suny at sin
 

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.790
on autistic individuals at suny at sin
or individuals with Alzheimer's and

00:23:18.790 --> 00:23:18.800

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:25.690
Parkinson's disease at ISC in Bangalore
so very important in all these aspects

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:25.700
so very important in all these aspects
 

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:26.650
so very important in all these aspects
is the development of new technologies

00:23:26.650 --> 00:23:26.660
is the development of new technologies
 

00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:29.230
is the development of new technologies
the application of new technologies that

00:23:29.230 --> 00:23:29.240
the application of new technologies that
 

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:30.910
the application of new technologies that
have been used in other domains to brain

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:30.920
have been used in other domains to brain
 

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.200
have been used in other domains to brain
science and the development of new

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:32.210
science and the development of new
 

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.500
science and the development of new
technologies and ultimately we want this

00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:35.510
technologies and ultimately we want this
 

00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:37.150
technologies and ultimately we want this
effort to have impact across a variety

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:37.160
effort to have impact across a variety
 

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.200
effort to have impact across a variety
of areas including health but also

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.210
of areas including health but also
 

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.190
of areas including health but also
commercialization if you look at the

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200
commercialization if you look at the
 

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.900
commercialization if you look at the
Human Genome Project one of the key

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:43.910
Human Genome Project one of the key
 

00:23:43.910 --> 00:23:46.300
Human Genome Project one of the key
steps was to develop technologies that

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:46.310
steps was to develop technologies that
 

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.220
steps was to develop technologies that
then could be used to study the human

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:48.230
then could be used to study the human
 

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.050
then could be used to study the human
genome we see the development of

00:23:50.050 --> 00:23:50.060
genome we see the development of
 

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.040
genome we see the development of
technologies and really the

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:51.050
technologies and really the
 

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.420
technologies and really the
commercialization of technologies as

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:52.430
commercialization of technologies as
 

00:23:52.430 --> 00:23:55.270
commercialization of technologies as
another outcome this will also have

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:55.280
another outcome this will also have
 

00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.280
another outcome this will also have
implications for policy for

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:57.290
implications for policy for
 

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.130
implications for policy for

what we envision will happen in the next
 

00:26:49.590 --> 00:26:51.470
what we envision will happen in the next
few years at Carnegie Mellon and what

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:51.480
few years at Carnegie Mellon and what
 

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.220
