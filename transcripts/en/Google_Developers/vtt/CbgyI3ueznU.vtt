Hey everybody, this
is Wesley Chun,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.192
engineer and developer
advocate here at Google.

00:00:04.192 --> 00:00:05.650
The question of
the day is, are you

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.440
a developer looking
to get your feet wet

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.410
integrating Google technologies
into your startup or enterprise

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.200
apps.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.790
Well, Startup
Launch is a program

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.630
that provides startups in
all stages with the platform,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.600
resources, online content,
mentorship, and training

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200
to help you start
something around your idea,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.700
build that product, and
grow your user base.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.020
Launchpad is a one-week program
for early stage startups

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.750
focused on subjects including
UI design, product strategy,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.930
marketing, and
business development.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.300
But not everyone can make
it to Launchpad events,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.860
so here we are.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.100
Launchpad Online
represents video content

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.660
for startups, hobbyists,
and even enterprises

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.070
to help you learn the
skills you need to succeed.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.610
Since technology is generally
at the heart of your solution,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.745
we will put one primary focus
on Google developer tools

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:52.190
and APIs.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.250
What are those?

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.050
Well, over the last
few years, we've

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.550
created web and
mobile apps that you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.500
may have used, like search,
YouTube, or one or more Google

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.830
Apps like Gmail or Google Docs.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.810
However, while my colleagues
are quite happy producing tools

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.270
like those for everyone,
we can't possibly

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.240
create them as quickly as all
of you out there combined.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.230
No, seriously, it's true.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.860
So we did the next best thing.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.370
We've made some of
our technologies

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.360
available for you to use,
including the developer tools

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.020
and APIs you see here.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.170
And we're adding new
features and APIs regularly.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.060
What can you do with them?

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.160
You can help your
users find out where

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.720
they need to go with Google Maps
while they're using your app

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.310
to find places to
go, eat, and play.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.030
You can give your
users the ability

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.330
to edit text or graphical
files on their Google Drive.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.350
Or perhaps, you want
to allow your users

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.160
to take videos from
their smartphones

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.430
and automatically upload
them so they could easily

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.970
share with friends or family,
without the phone or camera

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.190
to computer to YouTube
to email process.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.490
Oh, by the way, you can use
multiple APIs in the same app,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.510
like uploading those videos
to YouTube and Google Drive.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.200
These are just a
few ideas of what

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.470
you can do-- create an app,
without reinventing wheels,

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.680
whether it be for mobile, the
web, or, very likely, both.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.050
But how does one get
started using Google APIs?

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.340
Some developers have told
us that it's not always

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.640
easy to learn our
APIs or that there

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.880
isn't enough documentation
or working samples.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.930
In addition to covering skills
like design and distribution,

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.680
I'm happy to be your host for
the Launchpad Online video

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.240
series for developers
that aims to address

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.220
those exact problems.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.290
Each episode describes
and demonstrates

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.180
how to use one specific Google
API feature or developer

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.270
tool, allowing you to
get up to speed quickly.

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.300
Oh, one more thing-- while this
series is beginner friendly,

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.260
we do expect you
to be a developer,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.670
meaning you've
coded in languages

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.422
like JavaScript or Python.

00:02:48.422 --> 00:02:49.880
If you're new to
programming, there

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.510
are many MOOCs-- or massive
open online courses--

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.290
and tutorials out there
to help you learn to code.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.530
Once you've got some
experience under your belt,

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.380
we'll be here to help
you launch your idea.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.760
Now it's up to you.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.970
Start exploring our APIs is on
the Google Developers home page

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.260
or see other videos
in this series using

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.270
the link shown on this page.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.180
This is Wesley Chun,
and I look forward

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.330
to having you join
me on this adventure,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.700
learning and leveraging
Google technologies

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.420
available through our
APIs and developer tools.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.600
We'll see you soon on
the Launchpad Online

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.210
or at a Launchpad event.
