 You got to do it."</i>

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.977
So I go,
"No, that's degrading."

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.079
Then the other voice
in my head goes,

00:00:13.112 --> 00:00:15.648
"Yes, that's why it's so hot."

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.517

Some of y'all might
know this gentleman

from his work on the NBC series
"Hannibal,"

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.394

- People are different,
aren't they?

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.340
No, I mean, 'cause for me,

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:49.742
I see this,

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.844
and I want to smell it!

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.446
Like--

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.016
I mean--like--

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.252
That's right.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.922
And I'm gay!
I mean--

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.858
I mean, that's how much
of a perv I am!

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:10.930

care if it's lady parts!"

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:18.004

[giggles]
Oh, God.

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.608
I'm gonna smell it anyway.

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:25.879
[laughter, cheers, and applause]

00:02:32.318 --> 00:02:34.888
Maybe I'm a little bi.

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:40.326
Funk is funk, right, people?

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:42.996
Funk is funk!

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:46.632
So, uh...

00:02:46.665 --> 00:02:50.636
Just get a little bit
on me for later.

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.540
Yeah, little bit
of a doggie bag.

00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:57.844
[laughter and applause]

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:03.917
[cheers and applause]

00:03:05.217 --> 00:03:07.987
Right?
What kind of a dog would I be

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.690
if I didn't leave a little bit
of my scent, eh?

00:03:10.723 --> 00:03:13.993
Got to mark the stage!

00:03:14.026 --> 00:03:16.929
[laughter]

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:20.766
Anyways, that ain't my story.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:23.603
I want to talk
about a time in my life

00:03:23.636 --> 00:03:27.206
when I was pretty down,
pretty depressed.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.176
Anybody out there
ever been depressed?

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.844
[cheers and applause]

00:03:31.877 --> 00:03:35.681
Imagine asking that question
in a strip club.

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:37.683
Anybody ever been down?

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.852
[laughter]

00:03:39.885 --> 00:03:41.287
Everybody just gone out

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.189
and sought naked women
you don't know

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:46.025
to make you feel
like life isn't horrible?

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:48.361
That every happen
to anyone out there?

00:03:48.394 --> 00:03:52.198
[laughter]

00:03:52.231 --> 00:03:53.699
But it was really bad.

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:55.534
Like, it was a really bad time
in my life.

00:03:55.567 --> 00:03:56.869
I was really down.

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.972
It was that kind
of depression where

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:02.208
when a lightbulb burns out,

00:04:02.241 --> 00:04:03.643
you don't change it,

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.978
you just abandon the room.

00:04:06.011 --> 00:04:08.848
[laughter]

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:13.552
So--and, you know, everybody
has different ways of coping,

00:04:13.585 --> 00:04:15.221
you know, with depression.

00:04:15.254 --> 00:04:17.790
You know, you got the best ones,
the standard ones--

00:04:17.823 --> 00:04:21.394
drugs and alcohol.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.629
That's not my thing.
Oh, I still do them.

00:04:23.662 --> 00:04:26.565
Anyways,
I certainly use it to help,

00:04:26.598 --> 00:04:29.135
but my thing is...

00:04:29.168 --> 00:04:30.803
sex.

00:04:30.836 --> 00:04:34.573
I'm a horndog, I am.
I'm a middle-aged man whore.

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:37.777
And I've used sex--

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.445
I mean, I'm not proud of it,

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:41.414
but I know if I was straight,

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:43.783
I would definitely
have a hooker habit.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.585
I know that,
definitely a stripper habit.

00:04:46.618 --> 00:04:48.921
And so...

00:04:48.954 --> 00:04:52.758
what I did was
I was feeling bad about myself.

00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:54.160
I wanted to feel good.

00:04:54.193 --> 00:04:55.695
And, you know, I know
you're thinking,

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:57.196
"Oh, but you're a gay man!

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.800
"Gay men aren't doing
that anymore!

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:03.869
"You're all getting married!

00:05:03.902 --> 00:05:05.471
You're all being--"

00:05:05.504 --> 00:05:06.772
I can't even say it.

00:05:06.805 --> 00:05:08.774
[haltingly]
"Monogamous!"

00:05:08.807 --> 00:05:10.609
[laughs]
"Monogamous!"

00:05:10.642 --> 00:05:13.879
That's the only way I can get
it out--"Monogamous!"

00:05:13.912 --> 00:05:16.549
It seems like a foreign word,
I can say it.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:19.852
I mean, not all of us, you know,
are out there getting married

00:05:19.885 --> 00:05:23.289
and adopting
special-needs children.

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:25.224
Right?

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:28.361
Some of us just aren't
made for office work,

00:05:28.394 --> 00:05:30.029
you know what I mean?

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:33.566
You got to have some agents
out there in the field

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:37.069
bringing back the hard data
for the scientists.

00:05:37.102 --> 00:05:40.173
[laughter]

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.379
So it was one afternoon--
Yes, it gets worse.

00:05:46.412 --> 00:05:48.647
It was an afternoon.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.316
I'm an actor.
I've got afternoons off.

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:53.352
And, well, that wasn't
the real reason.

00:05:53.385 --> 00:05:54.653
This bathhouse--

00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:57.089
Yes, it was a bathhouse,
people.

00:05:57.122 --> 00:05:58.324
I know!

00:05:58.357 --> 00:06:00.826
I was a bit
of a bathhouse Betty.

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:03.496
That's what they called me.

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:05.331
It was an afternoon, and...

00:06:05.364 --> 00:06:07.666
Two for one, the lockers--
two for one.

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.502
It's called
an early-bird special.

00:06:09.535 --> 00:06:12.004
And so I went out there--

00:06:12.037 --> 00:06:14.173
'Cause here's the thing
about sex and me.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:17.376
I mean, I grew up as a little--
you know, little nerdy fag.

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:19.044
Not good at any sports.

00:06:19.077 --> 00:06:22.014
I can say "nerd," you're
allowed to say "nerd," right?

00:06:22.047 --> 00:06:24.049
That's not the n-word, is it?

00:06:24.082 --> 00:06:27.053
Nerd? Is it? Huh? Huh?

00:06:28.954 --> 00:06:30.923
But I wasn't really good
at any sports,

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:33.192
but then when I discovered
fucking,

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:37.530
I discovered
I was really good at it.

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:40.065
So I thought
I need a workout.

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:43.369
So I went down
to my favorite spot,

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:44.937
and what I like
about bathhouses--

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.473
so many things
I like about them.

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:51.110
From the lack of a digital
trail, which is lovely,

00:06:51.143 --> 00:06:53.879
to the fact that the bathhouses

00:06:53.912 --> 00:06:57.049
have the kinds of men
that I like.

00:06:57.082 --> 00:07:00.953
The bathhouses have become
sort of a--

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:02.154
hmm, how do I put it?

00:07:02.187 --> 00:07:05.224
A closet for the Third World.

00:07:05.257 --> 00:07:08.093
Sort of a Muslim closet,
sort of.

00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:12.097
And I do a lot of outreach
to the Muslim community.

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.966
I mean,
they should be paying me

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:17.102
to help those men adapt.

00:07:17.135 --> 00:07:20.506
But this bathhouse had all
my favorite kinds of guys--

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:24.443
balding brown men
with accents and flip-flops.

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:27.513
[laughter]

00:07:29.481 --> 00:07:30.916
Hey...

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:33.486
I've seen
more Indian men explode

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:36.288
than a Pakistani peacekeeper
in Kashmir.

00:07:36.321 --> 00:07:39.258
[laughter]

00:07:39.291 --> 00:07:42.294
Whoo! You fanned yourself
with that one.

00:07:42.327 --> 00:07:43.596
Whoo!

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:46.799
That calls for a bit of a rub.

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:50.870
[laughter]

00:07:50.903 --> 00:07:54.440
So I went out
for a little bit of outreach

00:07:54.473 --> 00:07:56.876
to the Muslim community.

00:07:56.909 --> 00:08:01.113
And so I go
to my favorite bathhouse,

00:08:01.146 --> 00:08:03.115
and I actually--
it's a strange subculture,

00:08:03.148 --> 00:08:04.617
the bathhouse subculture.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.685
I call it a subculture
so it doesn't seem

00:08:06.718 --> 00:08:09.688
as perverted and low.

00:08:09.721 --> 00:08:12.892
But, you know, there's two kinds
of men at a bathhouse.

00:08:12.925 --> 00:08:15.394
There's the wolves, who prowl.

00:08:15.427 --> 00:08:16.795
I'm a wolf.

00:08:16.828 --> 00:08:19.031
Oh, Jesus. That felt good.

00:08:19.064 --> 00:08:21.033
I'm a wolf, I prowl.

00:08:21.066 --> 00:08:24.904
The other kind are
the trapdoor spiders.

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:27.406
They lay in wait
in their lairs,

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.042
watching with
their compound eyes.

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:32.077
And when a wolf falls
into their lair,

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.812
they jump on his dick,

00:08:33.845 --> 00:08:36.815
and they ride him until
they've got his life fluid.

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:39.652
That's how it works.

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:42.889
[laughter]

00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:49.328
So, anyways, I'm there.
It's, like, the afternoon.

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:51.096
I'm wandering around
like a wolf,

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:53.532
howling occasionally
at the moon.

00:08:53.565 --> 00:08:55.935
And I look in this lair,

00:08:55.968 --> 00:08:59.838
and I see the oddest
trapdoor spider.

00:08:59.871 --> 00:09:01.273
All I can see are his eyes.

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:03.442
He's on his hands
and his knees.

00:09:03.475 --> 00:09:07.279
He's dressed completely
in black rubber.

00:09:07.312 --> 00:09:10.950
All I can see are his eyes.
Pretty, pretty eyes.

00:09:10.983 --> 00:09:15.087
Pretty, dead eyes.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.790
And he has a hose

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:20.259
coming out of his mouth...

00:09:20.292 --> 00:09:22.194
Uh-huh.

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:24.363
That's attached to a funnel,

00:09:24.396 --> 00:09:27.733
and it's all duct-taped
to his head.

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:30.936
And then he has a sign
around his neck that says,

00:09:30.969 --> 00:09:34.273
"The Human Urinal."

00:09:34.306 --> 00:09:36.976
I know, I know.
I know what you're thinking.

00:09:37.009 --> 00:09:40.212
You admire him, right?

00:09:40.245 --> 00:09:43.282
For going for what he wants.

00:09:43.315 --> 00:09:48.420
But you question
his fashion sense.

00:09:48.453 --> 00:09:49.888
Right?

00:09:49.921 --> 00:09:51.590
That's why you went like this.

00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:53.392
And I-I totally agree.

00:09:53.425 --> 00:09:57.663
I think that he should have
taken a page from Coco Chanel.

00:09:57.696 --> 00:10:01.100
Coco Chanel said,
"Before you leave the house,

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:03.969
always remove
one article of clothing."

00:10:04.002 --> 00:10:05.070
Right?

00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:06.939
Whether it be a bracelet,

00:10:06.972 --> 00:10:09.842
a scarf, an IV bag.

00:10:09.875 --> 00:10:12.111
[laughter]

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:16.281
I, myself,
would've removed the sign.

00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:19.451
I would've let the funnel
speak for itself.

00:10:19.484 --> 00:10:23.422
[laughter]

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:26.191
Right?

00:10:26.224 --> 00:10:27.593
Just 'cause you're a perv

00:10:27.626 --> 00:10:30.229
doesn't mean
you can't be subtle.

00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:35.134
So, anyways,
I'm wandering around,

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.935
and I keep looking in
at his lair,

00:10:36.968 --> 00:10:38.470
and he's still there, hopeful,

00:10:38.503 --> 00:10:41.173
on his hands and knees,
waiting for a wolf

00:10:41.206 --> 00:10:43.442
with a full bladder
to drop in.

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:45.778
And I keep looking at him,
and I'm kind of going--

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:47.613
And I'm not having a great day.

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.281
You know, I've been
wandering around--

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:52.351
I'm there for hours, hours,

00:10:52.384 --> 00:10:55.621
and I keep looking at him
and going, "That's--

00:10:55.654 --> 00:10:56.989
That's intriguing."

00:10:57.022 --> 00:10:59.491
I mean, I'm a gay man, right?

00:10:59.524 --> 00:11:04.063
When you're born gay,
you have a head start.

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.631
You know what I mean?

00:11:05.664 --> 00:11:08.233
I've done everything
that two to eleven men

00:11:08.266 --> 00:11:10.469
can do to one another.

00:11:10.502 --> 00:11:13.338
[laughter]

00:11:13.371 --> 00:11:14.373
Right?

00:11:14.406 --> 00:11:18.143
Yeah, and much of it on skates.

00:11:18.176 --> 00:11:20.045
So...

00:11:20.078 --> 00:11:22.047
that's where I am.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.649
So I don't judge.

00:11:23.682 --> 00:11:26.051
Like, I don't judge people
by their sex life.

00:11:26.084 --> 00:11:27.586
My God, when I was a kid,

00:11:27.619 --> 00:11:30.322
just being a fag
could land you in jail.

00:11:30.355 --> 00:11:32.991
So I don't care what weirdness
people are into.

00:11:33.024 --> 00:11:36.328
But I keep looking at him,
and going, "God, Scott.

00:11:36.361 --> 00:11:41.066
"You got to do it.
You got to!

00:11:41.099 --> 00:11:46.238
I mean, your friends will never
forgive you if you don't."

00:11:46.271 --> 00:11:50.209
So I keep going,
"No, that's degrading."

00:11:50.242 --> 00:11:51.944
Then the other voice
in my head goes,

00:11:51.977 --> 00:11:55.013
"Yes, that's why it's so hot."

00:11:55.046 --> 00:11:58.884
[laughter]

00:11:58.917 --> 00:12:02.421
So I eventually I look in,
and then I've been there,

00:12:02.454 --> 00:12:07.359
as I said, for hours,
so, I mean, people...

00:12:07.392 --> 00:12:12.197
eventually I have to go, right?

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.466
And when you're a man my age

00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:18.704
and you have a chance to pee,
you take it.

00:12:18.737 --> 00:12:22.074
You take--God, I'm thinking
of bringing the Human Urinal

00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:24.710
on a long car ride.

00:12:24.743 --> 00:12:26.979
I tell you,
you could definitely

00:12:27.012 --> 00:12:29.047
sell him at "Shark Tank."

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.284
[laughter]

00:12:34.319 --> 00:12:36.822
Yeah, that's what
I should be doing.

00:12:38.623 --> 00:12:41.827
So eventually I go,
"Ah, just go for it!"

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:44.396
So I leap into his lair.

00:12:44.429 --> 00:12:48.734
And I lope over,
howling occasionally.

00:12:48.767 --> 00:12:51.236
And then I, uh...

00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:54.072
pull my unit out.

00:12:54.105 --> 00:12:55.607
And, uh...

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:59.812
I lay it on the lip
of his fascinator.

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:02.114
[laughter]

00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:06.151
And then he waves me away,
grandly,

00:13:06.184 --> 00:13:09.855
like Maggie Smith
in "Downton Abbey,"

00:13:09.888 --> 00:13:11.857
with these words--

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:15.260
"Sorry, Scott. Not a fan."

00:13:15.293 --> 00:13:18.931
Not a fan!

00:13:18.964 --> 00:13:20.299
Yeah!

00:13:20.332 --> 00:13:25.037
You think you've hit
rock bottom?

00:13:25.070 --> 00:13:26.672
No.

00:13:26.705 --> 00:13:29.975
No, you haven't hit rock bottom

00:13:30.008 --> 00:13:34.046
until your pee isn't good enough
for the Human Urinal.

00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:36.782
[applause]

00:13:36.815 --> 00:13:37.950
