00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
going you know and so gets into motion

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:38.650 align:start position:0%

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:34.620 align:start position:0%
you know close and open and then he just
 

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.410 align:start position:0%
you know close and open and then he just
goes<00:13:34.800><c> like</c><00:13:35.010><c> this</c><00:13:35.190><c> and</c><00:13:35.399><c> takes</c><00:13:35.640><c> it</c><00:13:35.820><c> off</c><00:13:35.970><c> and</c>

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:36.420 align:start position:0%
goes like this and takes it off and
 

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.570 align:start position:0%
goes like this and takes it off and

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:54.060 align:start position:0%
they do it something when there is where
 

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.150 align:start position:0%
they do it something when there is where

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
they actually can open but that's the
 

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.550 align:start position:0%
they actually can open but that's the
thing<00:13:56.850><c> that's</c><00:13:57.510><c> where</c><00:13:57.750><c> you'd</c><00:13:58.050><c> attach</c><00:13:58.350><c> this</c><00:13:58.500><c> to</c>

00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
thing that's where you'd attach this to
 

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.370 align:start position:0%
thing that's where you'd attach this to
the<00:13:58.830><c> armor</c><00:13:59.279><c> to</c><00:13:59.310><c> the</c><00:13:59.459><c> number</c><00:13:59.850><c> whatever</c><00:14:00.140><c> oh</c><00:14:01.140><c> yeah</c>

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
the armor to the number whatever oh yeah
 

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.530 align:start position:0%
the armor to the number whatever oh yeah
it<00:14:01.800><c> goes</c><00:14:01.860><c> like</c><00:14:02.220><c> that</c><00:14:02.250><c> but</c><00:14:02.760><c> that's</c><00:14:03.209><c> like</c><00:14:03.360><c> taking</c>

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
it goes like that but that's like taking
 

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:04.699 align:start position:0%
it goes like that but that's like taking
off<00:14:03.930><c> the</c><00:14:03.959><c> hand</c>

00:14:04.699 --> 00:14:04.709 align:start position:0%
off the hand
 

00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:07.430 align:start position:0%
off the hand
I<00:14:04.860><c> guess</c><00:14:05.520><c> well</c><00:14:06.360><c> then</c><00:14:06.480><c> again</c><00:14:06.600><c> I</c><00:14:06.750><c> guess</c><00:14:07.050><c> maybe</c><00:14:07.290><c> if</c>

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
I guess well then again I guess maybe if
 

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.050 align:start position:0%
I guess well then again I guess maybe if
you<00:14:07.560><c> take</c><00:14:07.709><c> off</c><00:14:07.890><c> the</c><00:14:08.040><c> hand</c><00:14:08.250><c> and</c><00:14:08.399><c> there's</c><00:14:08.550><c> the</c>

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
you take off the hand and there's the
 

00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
you take off the hand and there's the
same<00:14:09.270><c> attachment</c><00:14:09.720><c> but</c><00:14:10.470><c> you</c><00:14:10.589><c> but</c><00:14:10.860><c> even</c><00:14:11.100><c> taking</c>
