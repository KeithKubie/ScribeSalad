institutions work and why we have them

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259
institutions work and why we have them
 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.349
institutions work and why we have them
and that is something that economists

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359
and that is something that economists
 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.899
and that is something that economists
have not been paying as much attention

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909
have not been paying as much attention
 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.669
have not been paying as much attention
to as to the workings of markets and so

Williamson has primarily been trying to
 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.929
Williamson has primarily been trying to
understand the existence of firms and

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939
understand the existence of firms and

associations in particular groups of
 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.489
associations in particular groups of
users of local natural resources and so

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499
users of local natural resources and so
 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:52.539
users of local natural resources and so
they were exploring nan market

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549
they were exploring nan market
 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:54.459
they were exploring nan market
institutions was that was that because

00:01:54.459 --> 00:01:54.469
institutions was that was that because
 

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:56.589
institutions was that was that because
they it was a particular interest or

00:01:56.589 --> 00:01:56.599
they it was a particular interest or
 

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:57.999
they it was a particular interest or
were they interested in these

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009
were they interested in these
 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:01:59.199
were they interested in these
institutions or were they particularly

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209
institutions or were they particularly
 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.800

aunty market institutions well I don't

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810
aunty market institutions well I don't
 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.300
aunty market institutions well I don't
think that you could call any of them

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310
think that you could call any of them
 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.419
think that you could call any of them
anti-market

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429
 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.900
but it's evident that a lot of resource

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910
but it's evident that a lot of resource
 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.820
but it's evident that a lot of resource
allocation takes place outside of

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830
allocation takes place outside of
 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.280
allocation takes place outside of
markets and no matter whether we like

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290
markets and no matter whether we like
 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.950
markets and no matter whether we like
markets or not we need to understand why

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960
markets or not we need to understand why
 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.270
markets or not we need to understand why
that is so and both in the case of

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280
that is so and both in the case of
 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.490
that is so and both in the case of
ostrom and Williamson they see that

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500
ostrom and Williamson they see that
 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.070
ostrom and Williamson they see that
there are important efficiencies to be

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080
there are important efficiencies to be
 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.030
there are important efficiencies to be
had that you're sometimes cannot have in

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040
had that you're sometimes cannot have in
 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.760
had that you're sometimes cannot have in
markets so if we if we go through each

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770
markets so if we if we go through each
 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.800
markets so if we if we go through each
half the price separately we'll start

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810
half the price separately we'll start
 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.560
half the price separately we'll start
with the achievements of Elinor Ostrom

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
with the achievements of Elinor Ostrom
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.180
with the achievements of Elinor Ostrom
what more particular was she studying

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190
what more particular was she studying
 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.040
what more particular was she studying
and why well her research is very much

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050
and why well her research is very much
 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.449
and why well her research is very much
based on empirical studies of how local

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459
based on empirical studies of how local
 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.510
based on empirical studies of how local
natural resources you know like pastures

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520
natural resources you know like pastures
 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.860
natural resources you know like pastures
like dams for irrigation groundwater

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
like dams for irrigation groundwater
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.960
like dams for irrigation groundwater
woods fish stocks you name it she wanted

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970
woods fish stocks you name it she wanted
 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.070
woods fish stocks you name it she wanted
to understand how user management of

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080
to understand how user management of
 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.520
to understand how user management of
those resources actually work in

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530
those resources actually work in
 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.400
those resources actually work in
practice and it seems like a very

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410
practice and it seems like a very
 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.440
practice and it seems like a very
interesting field to study were there

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
interesting field to study were there
 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.570
interesting field to study were there
any preconceptions about how these these

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580
any preconceptions about how these these
 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.880
any preconceptions about how these these
areas are managed yes and that's

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890
areas are managed yes and that's
 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.900
areas are managed yes and that's
important because both in economics and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910
important because both in economics and
 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.780
important because both in economics and
in biology there was this preconception

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790
in biology there was this preconception
 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.479
in biology there was this preconception
that the common property will always be

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489
that the common property will always be
 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.850
that the common property will always be
mismanaged and hence you have two

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860
mismanaged and hence you have two
 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.210
mismanaged and hence you have two
solutions either you split it up so all

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220
solutions either you split it up so all
 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.340
solutions either you split it up so all
properties owned by individuals or you

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350
properties owned by individuals or you
 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.470
properties owned by individuals or you
involve the government and you have

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480
involve the government and you have
 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.410
involve the government and you have
government regulating the usage through

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420
government regulating the usage through

Ostrom after performing her own studies

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720
Ostrom after performing her own studies
 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.630
Ostrom after performing her own studies
and also looking at what other people

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640
and also looking at what other people
 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.610
and also looking at what other people
were finding she concluded that the

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620
were finding she concluded that the
 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.610
were finding she concluded that the
common property regimes could actually

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
common property regimes could actually
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.759
common property regimes could actually
in many cases work better than either of

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769
in many cases work better than either of
 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:13.789
in many cases work better than either of
the two alternatives that have been

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799
the two alternatives that have been
 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:14.520
the two alternatives that have been
proposed

do you have any examples of how this

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720
do you have any examples of how this
 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.039
do you have any examples of how this
work successfully oh yes there are lots

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049
work successfully oh yes there are lots
 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.760
work successfully oh yes there are lots
and lots of examples so the challenge is

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770
and lots of examples so the challenge is
 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.020
and lots of examples so the challenge is
to find the most striking one so one one

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030
to find the most striking one so one one

in in and around Mongolia because if you

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640
in in and around Mongolia because if you
 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.110
in in and around Mongolia because if you
look at the satellite photos you will

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120
look at the satellite photos you will
 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.180
look at the satellite photos you will
see that there are some areas that are

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190
see that there are some areas that are
 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.160
see that there are some areas that are
clearly green and then you will see

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170
clearly green and then you will see
 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.710
clearly green and then you will see
other areas where there's been a lot of

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720
other areas where there's been a lot of
 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.530
other areas where there's been a lot of
degradation so looks almost brown and

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540
degradation so looks almost brown and
 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.560
degradation so looks almost brown and
then you overlay national boundaries and

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570

not going to be the whole answer you

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:52.990
not going to be the whole answer you
 

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:55.410
not going to be the whole answer you
need to understand what is the problems

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.420
need to understand what is the problems
 

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:59.730

of transacting and what Williamson has

00:09:59.730 --> 00:09:59.740
of transacting and what Williamson has
 

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:03.670

done is to flesh out that

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680
done is to flesh out that
 

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.379
done is to flesh out that
answer in much more detail so that we

00:10:06.379 --> 00:10:06.389
answer in much more detail so that we
 

00:10:06.389 --> 00:10:11.629
answer in much more detail so that we
can take it to data and see if if you

00:10:11.629 --> 00:10:11.639
can take it to data and see if if you
 

00:10:11.639 --> 00:10:15.079
can take it to data and see if if you
could have a theory that stands up in a

00:10:15.079 --> 00:10:15.089
could have a theory that stands up in a
 

00:10:15.089 --> 00:10:17.600
could have a theory that stands up in a
scientific way so how do markets and

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:17.610
scientific way so how do markets and
 

00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:19.100
scientific way so how do markets and
firms differ in the way they approach

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:19.110

the same subject and what did Oliver

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:20.910
the same subject and what did Oliver

Williamson discover that firms do better

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480
Williamson discover that firms do better
 

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:27.939
Williamson discover that firms do better
well so his argument is that the problem

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:27.949
well so his argument is that the problem
 

00:10:27.949 --> 00:10:31.069
well so his argument is that the problem
with market interaction is that you need

00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079
with market interaction is that you need
 

00:10:31.079 --> 00:10:34.910
with market interaction is that you need
both parties to agree and that means

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920
both parties to agree and that means
 

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.730
both parties to agree and that means
that I have an incentive to bargain

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:37.740
that I have an incentive to bargain
 

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:41.629
that I have an incentive to bargain
strategically with you and vice versa we

00:10:41.629 --> 00:10:41.639
strategically with you and vice versa we
 

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:43.970
strategically with you and vice versa we
may spend resources on that and we may

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980
may spend resources on that and we may
 

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.040
may spend resources on that and we may
in the end we may fail to agree indeed

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.050
in the end we may fail to agree indeed
 

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.829
in the end we may fail to agree indeed
because we push too hard within the firm

00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:50.839

gradual corroborations of work so in
 

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:27.319
gradual corroborations of work so in
Williamson's case you know we did much

00:13:27.319 --> 00:13:27.329
Williamson's case you know we did much
 

00:13:27.329 --> 00:13:29.960
Williamson's case you know we did much
of his work in the 70s and 80s and then

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:29.970
of his work in the 70s and 80s and then
 

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:31.389
of his work in the 70s and 80s and then
gradually it's been corroborated

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.230
economic sciences because in the
physical sciences of biological sciences

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:19.240
physical sciences of biological sciences
 

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:21.660
physical sciences of biological sciences
one waits for there to be proved but in

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:21.670
one waits for there to be proved but in
 

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.670
one waits for there to be proved but in
economics one not only has to wait for

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:23.680
economics one not only has to wait for
 

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:25.110
economics one not only has to wait for
there to be proved that one has to do

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120
there to be proved that one has to do
 

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.550
there to be proved that one has to do
that within the cycles of human behavior

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:26.560
that within the cycles of human behavior
 

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.860
that within the cycles of human behavior
does that present more difficulties when

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:28.870
does that present more difficulties when
 

00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:32.490
does that present more difficulties when
it comes to awarding prizes well yes and

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:32.500
it comes to awarding prizes well yes and
 

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.269
it comes to awarding prizes well yes and
no I think there is a misconception

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279
no I think there is a misconception
 

00:14:35.279 --> 00:14:39.300
no I think there is a misconception
actually about the difficulties of

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:39.310
actually about the difficulties of
 

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:42.030
actually about the difficulties of
testing theories and economics relative

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:42.040
testing theories and economics relative
 

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:47.759
testing theories and economics relative
to other sciences if you compare it to

00:14:47.759 --> 00:14:47.769
to other sciences if you compare it to
 

00:14:47.769 --> 00:14:52.110
to other sciences if you compare it to
medicine for example often we live for a

00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120
medicine for example often we live for a
 

00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:54.990
medicine for example often we live for a
very long time before we're sure whether

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:55.000
very long time before we're sure whether
 

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.230
very long time before we're sure whether
a particular theory in in medicine is is

00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240
a particular theory in in medicine is is
 

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.050
a particular theory in in medicine is is
correct and I think about astronomy so

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.060
correct and I think about astronomy so
 

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.240
correct and I think about astronomy so
on and so forth and there are theories

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.250
on and so forth and there are theories
 

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:06.059
on and so forth and there are theories
in economics that has that have been

00:15:06.059 --> 00:15:06.069
in economics that has that have been
 

00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:11.040
in economics that has that have been
tested down to the last decimal so yes I

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:11.050
tested down to the last decimal so yes I
 

00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:14.069
tested down to the last decimal so yes I
think so on average if you compare to

00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079
think so on average if you compare to
 

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:16.769
think so on average if you compare to
physics for example we have to live with

00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:16.779
physics for example we have to live with
 

00:15:16.779 --> 00:15:20.819
physics for example we have to live with
a bit more uncertainty and we have to

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:20.829
a bit more uncertainty and we have to
 

00:15:20.829 --> 00:15:25.949
a bit more uncertainty and we have to
use slightly different methods but it's

00:15:25.949 --> 00:15:25.959
use slightly different methods but it's
 

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.800
use slightly different methods but it's
it's a matter of degree not a matter of

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:28.810
it's a matter of degree not a matter of
 

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:32.819
it's a matter of degree not a matter of
sort I think and so the first prize in

00:15:32.819 --> 00:15:32.829
sort I think and so the first prize in
 

00:15:32.829 --> 00:15:35.370
sort I think and so the first prize in
economic sciences rewards in 1969 which

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:35.380
economic sciences rewards in 1969 which
 

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:39.179
economic sciences rewards in 1969 which
makes us the 40th anniversary and this

00:15:39.179 --> 00:15:39.189
makes us the 40th anniversary and this
 

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:40.860
makes us the 40th anniversary and this
this year marks the first time that I

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:40.870
this year marks the first time that I
 

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.780
this year marks the first time that I
that a female laureate has received the

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:42.790
that a female laureate has received the
 

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.629
that a female laureate has received the
prize are we now turning a corner in

00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639
prize are we now turning a corner in
 

00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:48.569
prize are we now turning a corner in
terms of awarding the prize to female

00:15:48.569 --> 00:15:48.579
terms of awarding the prize to female
 

00:15:48.579 --> 00:15:50.130
terms of awarding the prize to female
economists

00:15:50.130 --> 00:15:50.140
economists
 

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:54.010
economists
well it's that's it's hard to speculate

00:15:54.010 --> 00:15:54.020
well it's that's it's hard to speculate
 

00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.010
well it's that's it's hard to speculate
about that in particular since we don't

00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:57.020
about that in particular since we don't
 

00:15:57.020 --> 00:16:00.420
about that in particular since we don't
want to tie down future committees I

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:00.430
want to tie down future committees I
 

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:05.020
want to tie down future committees I
guess it's a reasonable gas but it's

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:05.030
guess it's a reasonable gas but it's
 

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:08.320
guess it's a reasonable gas but it's
certainly a reasonable guess that a long

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.330
certainly a reasonable guess that a long
 

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:11.770
certainly a reasonable guess that a long
be another 40 years before we see a

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:11.780
be another 40 years before we see a
 

00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:15.820
be another 40 years before we see a
second female laureate at the same time

00:16:15.820 --> 00:16:15.830
second female laureate at the same time
 

00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:23.650
second female laureate at the same time
the diffraction of full professors and

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:23.660
the diffraction of full professors and
 

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:29.020
the diffraction of full professors and
economics who are female it's not

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:29.030
economics who are female it's not
 

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.630
economics who are female it's not
increasing all that fast so we I think

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:34.640
increasing all that fast so we I think
 

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.110
increasing all that fast so we I think
we'll have to wait and see and you know

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:38.120
we'll have to wait and see and you know
 

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.700
we'll have to wait and see and you know
whether whether this is a change in

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:39.710
whether whether this is a change in
 

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:43.000
whether whether this is a change in
trend or not you saw the chemistry price

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:43.010
trend or not you saw the chemistry price
 

00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:45.520
trend or not you saw the chemistry price
it's the first female this year since

00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:45.530
it's the first female this year since
 

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:50.680
it's the first female this year since
1963 45 years so hopefully the wooden

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:50.690
1963 45 years so hopefully the wooden
 

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:52.000
1963 45 years so hopefully the wooden
the price issue will provide some form

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:52.010
the price issue will provide some form
 

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.630
the price issue will provide some form
of inspiration yes I think that that's

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:55.640
of inspiration yes I think that that's
 

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.610
of inspiration yes I think that that's
the nice thing I believe at least it

00:16:57.610 --> 00:16:57.620
the nice thing I believe at least it
 

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.120
the nice thing I believe at least it

this prices it's a positive message so
final question have you managed to

final question have you managed to
 

00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:11.110
final question have you managed to
contact both laureates yes we have had

00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120
contact both laureates yes we have had
 

00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.250
contact both laureates yes we have had
they react well they were both very

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:15.260
they react well they were both very
 

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.320
they react well they were both very
pleased of course and as I said the

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:17.330
pleased of course and as I said the
 

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:20.440
pleased of course and as I said the

00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:20.450
humbled and I guess they need to take
