1
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.070
Yup.

2
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.500
<v 1>Hey,
every buddy,</v>

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.550
this episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by Lumosity.

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.440
Lumosity is essentially a gym for your brain.
Uh,

5
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.290
the idea behind that Lumosity is give your brain some exercise just like you

6
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.080
give your body some exercise and do it in a way that's actually fun,

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.470
fun and interesting.
It's their brain games.
Um,

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Lumosity is essentially without the way they've set it up.
Um,

9
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.070
you can go to Lumosity and enter in a bunch of different parameters what you're

10
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:39.970
interested in doing,
working on different things like memory or what have you,
uh,

11
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.620
challenging your brain with scientifically designed training.

12
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.430
And if you click the get started now button,
you see what I'm talking about.

13
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.090
They have all these different aspects that you can,
a,

14
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.720
you could work on specifically like memory,
recalling the locations of things,
uh,

15
00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.920
learning new subjects quickly.
Attention is another one.

16
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.450
Speed flexibilities one.
I really like avoiding errors,

17
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:05.460
multitasking quickly and efficiently.

18
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.320
And then once you enter in all your parameters,

19
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
they set up these challenging games for you that are actually fun.

20
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.190
They're fun in their exercise essentially for your brain.

21
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.150
Lumosity is brain games are designed by top scientists to train the mental

22
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.931
processes,

23
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.560
and over time you can track your progress online and compare yourself with other

24
00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:27.090
people.
So it's essentially,
look,
we all like playing stupid games.

25
00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.270
What do you like playing?
What?
Let's set candy,
stupid fucking candy game.

26
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:34.080
The kids play candy crush or angry birds,
whatever it is.

27
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.040
Those are wastes of time.
Waits is of time.
Notice something.
My vocabulary.

28
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:41.750
It's quite excellent.
Waste to CIS of time.
I'm Gollum.

29
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.330
It loves it.
Um,

30
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.930
but Lumosity allows you to do it and actually do something good for yourself.

We're also brought to you by audible.com audible.com is the internet.

40
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.410
The Internet's number one provider of audio entertainment.

uh,

43
00:02:38.191 --> 00:02:43.191
They have literally everything you would ever want as far as audio

44
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:47.220
entertainment.
I'm a huge fan of audible.
It's a fantastic service.

45
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:52.020
It's been around for a long time.
They've always actually even supported standup.

46
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.710
There was quite a while ago,
Steve Marmel,

47
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.920
a couple other guys were doing a five new minutes every week and uploading them

48
00:02:58.921 --> 00:02:59.950
on audible.com.

49
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.880
It was a kind of interesting little experiment that they were doing.
And um,
they,

50
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:07.760
they have comedy specials,
they have radio shows,
they have,
um,

51
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.500
old speeches and lectures.
It's just a,

52
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.510
a veritable feast of audio entertainment and an awesome treasure chest of audio

53
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:21.940
entertainment.

you can get one free audio book in 30 free days of audible service.

55
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.260
That's audible.com forward slash Joe.
Um,

56
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.270
I couldn't say enough about audible.
Really love it.

57
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.130
Largest selection of audio books online over 150,000.
Exactly.
Uh,

58
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.510
you can also use,
use them from your smartphone,
tablet,
desktop,

59
00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.330
and they have a thing for the,
um,

60
00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.470
the Amazon kindle fire HD called whisper whisper sync.

61
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.730
It's an application that is truly brilliant and what it does is allows you to

62
00:03:54.731 --> 00:03:59.140
read a book,
uh,
from Your Amazon,
uh,
those,
you know,
those uh,

63
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.160
kindle fires.
So like just like sort of an iPad for reading books,
kindle fire,

64
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.380
HD movies on it and shit like that.

65
00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.280
But this application allows you to download one of the audible books.

66
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.030
You read up into a certain point and then when you're done reading,

67
00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.660
you get in your car and the,
the audio version of it,

68
00:04:16.661 --> 00:04:19.960
the audible version of it starts playing and direct sync.

69
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.300
That's Campbell Mclaren.

70
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:26.670
If you hear that guy was sucking into the microphone lookers coffee,
I didn't.

71
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.310
audible.com forward slash was on.
Oh,
of course it was.

72
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:31.750

We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o n n I t,

75
00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.290
makers of Alpha brain shroom tech,
new mood.

76
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.800
Audible is not what I'm talking about.
Alpha brain,

77
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.220
what on it.com is a human optimization website.

78
00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:54.370
What we have is things that make your body work better,

79
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:55.960
things that make your brain work better,

80
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:01.150
athletic equipment that enhances your physical strength and conditioning and

81
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.110
stuff that you can use.
That really does apply to a athletics.

82
00:05:05.111 --> 00:05:10.111
We sell a lot of cardio equipment as far as like we sell battle ropes and weight

83
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:15.610
vests and strength and conditioning equipment like kettlebells and maces and

84
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:17.920
steel clubs and medicine balls.

85
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.910
We essentially sell things that we use for strength and conditioning,

86
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:26.860
whether it's martial arts training or people that do any real rigorous activity

87
00:05:26.861 --> 00:05:31.070
that requires you to have physical strength.
Um,
there's no better way than,

88
00:05:31.071 --> 00:05:35.300
than using things like kettlebells that use your whole body as one unit.
Um,

89
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.540
if you are thinking about doing it,
um,
please get a trainer or at the very least,

90
00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.100
watch some instructional videos and start out slow with some lightweights and

91
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:49.870
use proper form.
Don't want to hurt yourself.
Uh,
we,
we sell a bunch of foods.

92
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.290
We sell a hemp force protein and hemp force bars,

93
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:57.560
which are excellent and nutritious alternatives to shitty snack foods that you

94
00:05:57.561 --> 00:06:02.400
might have laying around your office.
And,
um,
lots of other things like,
um,

95
00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.350
buffalo bars,
these Tonka,
uh,
buffalo bars,
which are made the same way the,

96
00:06:07.351 --> 00:06:09.450
uh,
American Indians used to make them.
They're,

97
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.950
they're made with cranberries actually there.
They're quite delicious,
uh,

98
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.690
traditional 100% natural Lakota tribal recipe,
really good stuff.

99
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:22.550
And they stay sit a stable on your shelf for up to 18 months.
And this is,

100
00:06:22.551 --> 00:06:24.800
you know,
doing it the way native Americans do it.

101
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.500
So you can pretend you're an Indian out there wandering your woods.

102
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:30.680
Pretend you're eating your tonka bar from a Tonka,
you'll kill yourself.

103
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.190
Does that racist?
And to make an Indian accent,
I'm not sure.

104
00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:37.170
<v 2>Anyway,
go down a Japanese to me.
So I think you're okay.</v>

105
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:41.940
There was a little Japanese,
Very Samurai,
right?
Uh,
on a.com.

106
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:46.810
<v 1>N N I t use the Codeword Rogan save 10% off any and all supplements,</v>

107
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.060

Um,

108
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:54.061
as far as health and supplements for conditioning and your immune system and all

109
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:56.230
sorts of good shit.
And have you used the Codeword Rogan,

110
00:06:56.231 --> 00:06:59.350
you will save 10% off any and all supplements.
All right.

116
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.350
<v 2>Once upon a time I met a man named Campbell Mclaren who dragged me into a world</v>

117
00:07:20.351 --> 00:07:24.940
of mixed martial arts.
Wonderful.
Dragged you.
Pulled me in buddy.

118
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:26.770
Uh,
I was,
uh,

119
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.540
I was in Los Angeles and I got a call from my manager and it was essentially

120
00:07:31.541 --> 00:07:34.770
saying,
all right,
there's this thing that we've got an offer before.

121
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.310
I'm sure you're not going to want to do this,
but next friend Jeff says,

122
00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:44.230
what a pitch mine as well.
And now here we are many,
many years later.
Um,

123
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.740
that was UFC 12 in 1997.
Uh,
and um,

124
00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:53.890
Bob Meyrowitz was the president and owner of needs.
You just give him the finger.

125
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.130
How dare you cause that what that was now it was picking my Bob Myerwitz was the

126
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:03.190
uh,
the owner and a Campbell Mclaren.
What was your official title?

127
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:09.170
Oh,
Kylie's exec producer,
you know,
co creators.
What they call me now?
Aye.
Aye.

128
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:13.990
Aye.
He peed the shows and was uh,
the head of programming for the companies.

129
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:19.020
And you were there for you fc one that was there for 0.01 young guy was,

130
00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:22.820
<v 1>oh my boy.
I was like a little,
see my up there on the screen.</v>

131
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.210
Also scrappy little youngster when I was working for you guys.
What happened?

132
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.760
I became an old man.

133
00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.310
<v 2>No,
you can gain years and uh,</v>

134
00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:36.640
you know you still can look oh gay.
Cause you look like a fighter to me.

135
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.220
You look more like a fight or now than when you started.

136
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.850
Well I didn't lift weights done.
That's why I started doing Jujitsu.

137
00:08:42.851 --> 00:08:46.760
Like right before I did that show.
But back then I was just doing kickboxing.
No,

138
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:47.980
no weightlifting ever.

139
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:50.620
But once I started June doing Jujitsu and getting manhandled,

140
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:53.590
I said to put some meat on you guys.
This is ridiculous.

141
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:57.390
I'm tired of getting raped.
Well,
the Gracies,
here's the pledge they made to me.

142
00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.200
Then you'd go,
you know,
gamble gum,
started Brazilian Jujitsu,

143
00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:02.760
Gracie Jujitsu with the family.

144
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:07.470
We promise not to break your ribs the first couple times.
That was the price.

145
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.580
That's it.
That's the,
that's what I get from nobody writes on three.
Yeah.

146
00:09:11.581 --> 00:09:13.920
You don't get good at Jujitsu by not getting your ass kicked.

147
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.060
Everybody gets their ass kicked.

148
00:09:15.061 --> 00:09:17.940
It's impossible to not get your ass kicked and get good at Jujitsu.

149
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.150
You have to do it.
You have to experience it.
Do you think you're good at Jujitsu?

150
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:26.490
I got a couple of black belts.
As far as like regular people.
Yeah,
I'm good.

151
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.930
As far as like really good.
You get to people.
I'm not that good.

152
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.820
So say you were going to fight like a guy like a guy named Wesley snipes.

153
00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:41.400
Campbell's other idea.
Oh,
I'm so sorry that didn't happen.

154
00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:46.800
God,
that would've been great.
I changed my whole life for like four months.

155
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:51.560
Oh,
that was hard.
He changed his life too.
But yeah,

156
00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.400
unfortunately he changed,

157
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:56.400
but we found out why he wanted to do it in the first place when all the tax

158
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:58.730
stuff came out.
But Campbell called me up and uh,

159
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.120
asked me out of the blue if I wanted to fight Wesley snipes.
I tell anything.

160
00:10:03.121 --> 00:10:04.320
I thought thought about it very long.

161
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:05.610
I don't remember how long I thought about it.

162
00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:09.420
I think you came directly to my house and you didn't even,

163
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:13.560
you dropped the phone and ran to my house to sign the contract.
I mean,
no,

164
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:16.000
you were very into it.
There was no doubt about it.
Well,

165
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.170
I just didn't imagine that a guy who's never done Jujitsu and his life was going

166
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:23.350
to keep me from strangling them.
I'm like,
okay,
like what are you,

167
00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:25.260
what are you going to do?
You're going to get good in a couple of months.

168
00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:25.771
Do you know,

169
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:29.340
you think there's anyone out there now that still thinks that still thinks they

170
00:10:29.341 --> 00:10:33.240
can do?
The people who have never trained this is that simple.

171
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:37.410
Anybody who's ever trained,
you just do it all.
You feel so helpless.
I,

172
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.470
when I go into Jujitsu,
I was 26 years old.

173
00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:45.240
I was a black belt in taekwondo,
former us open champion,

174
00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:49.380
very good athlete.
Kickbox my whole life was constantly working out.

175
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:53.760
It was very lean,
very in shape.
And I just got ragdolled.

176
00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:58.500
I mean ragdolled we're like,
Gee,
guys would just do whatever they wanted.
To me.

177
00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:02.880
It was so humiliating.
It was so like enlightening too though.

178
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.430
Like Sergio Colon,
I don't know if you remember Sergio Colon,

179
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:08.220
he was one of Carlson Gracie's guys and um,

180
00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.610
John Awano who makes them want Ogeez now.
Um,
I,
I can't,
I,

181
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:16.950
that's where I first started to some Gracie's and I took a class one class only

182
00:11:16.951 --> 00:11:21.930
at Hickson's and then I went from Hickson's and uh,
I guess it was 97,

183
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:24.750
96,
maybe 96.
I went from,
yeah,

184
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:29.550
it was 96 in Hickson's and Carlson Gracie's and then 98 from the 98 on,

185
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:33.780
I've been with the Machados.
So,
um,
when I started training with them,

186
00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:38.310
it was just immediately apparent that I had these delusions in my head.

187
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.743
Like these,

188
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.590
the same thing that I like the first feeling I got when I saw UFC too.

189
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.500
I've watched it on video tape.
I got it from Hollywood,

190
00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:49.710
bought one of those Hollywood video stores.
And um,

191
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:54.220
I remember thinking right away,
shit,
um,
I got fucking learn this.

192
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:58.030
Like this is this guy in who knows how to do something that none of these people

193
00:11:58.031 --> 00:11:59.830
know how to do.
And it was a real,
like a,

194
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:05.260
like a disturbing awakening watching hoists,
strangle all these people like,
okay,

195
00:12:05.261 --> 00:12:08.350
would he's,
you know,
this ain't a coincidence.
He keeps doing that.

196
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:11.770
Like nobody could stop him from doing that.
Like,
oh,
I got to learn that shit.

197
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.550
And when I actually did start training it,
it was so shocking.

198
00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:18.970
Like I was so far off from what I thought I was going to be able to do.

199
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:23.300
I thought I'd be able to keep,
keep say,
you know,
stay safe.
I go,
Eh,
you know,
I'm,

200
00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.360
I'm pretty good athlete.
Most of these people don't know what they're doing.

201
00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.510
I've been in martial arts my whole life,
helpless,
helpless on the ground,

202
00:12:28.511 --> 00:12:30.070
just helpless.
And I wrestled.

203
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.550
I wrestled a year in high school is a decent wrestler,
helpless,

204
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:37.780
getting strangled,
triangled arm barred.
If you don't train,

205
00:12:37.781 --> 00:12:42.190
if you don't go in there and don't train with like really elite Jujitsu people,

206
00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:44.770
you really don't know,
help us.
You are,
you don't know.

207
00:12:44.771 --> 00:12:48.010
You got these ideas in your head and I think that's probably what was going on

208
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:51.640
with Wesley.
Probably had these ideas based on his karate background.

209
00:12:51.641 --> 00:12:54.460
And so these ideas about what he was going to be capable of doing.

210
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.960
<v 3>Um,
yeah.
Or maybe you thought he could use a sword because yep.</v>

211
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.460
<v 2>People kept saying just play and get to use the plate when his vampire strength</v>

212
00:13:02.461 --> 00:13:07.020
too.
That's a lot,
a lot of advantages to being bored.
You know,
I told you,
I saw

213
00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:11.950
<v 3>that video that he sent,
he was training in Kenya somewhere in it.</v>

214
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:16.670
Maybe it was South Africa and uh,
and trainings training.
I,

215
00:13:16.690 --> 00:13:20.940
I get it.
Right.
I know training is not a fight,
but you know,

216
00:13:20.941 --> 00:13:23.630
I've seen Floyd training videos too.
You know,

217
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:28.440
he looks good and Wesley looked good.
He looked fast.
Uh,

218
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.801
you know,

219
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:32.910
I didn't see how anyone could go through that and have the drug problems.

220
00:13:32.911 --> 00:13:36.150
Everyone's said he had.
Um,
what about Mike Tyson?

221
00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:41.000
<v 2>Mike Tyson and he used cocaine problem and that's what he's coming out and</v>

222
00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:43.100
talking about now.
He fought when he was doing coke.
Yeah.

223
00:13:43.101 --> 00:13:46.040
There's a different theme.
Crack and coke though.
Oh,

224
00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:49.070
you can maintain healthy lifestyle on cocaine.

225
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.140
You want you to go to the pipe man.

226
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.350
So you're seeing that Wesley was on the pipe is I wish that that's what the

227
00:13:54.351 --> 00:13:57.620
rumors were.
I never saw it.
Didn't know it.
Not For me,

228
00:13:57.650 --> 00:14:00.760
but a lot of people told me that.
Well,
I've heard that about me though.
Not,

229
00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:04.490
not about the pipe,
but about coke.
I've never done cocaine in my life ever.

230
00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.450
But I've heard.
And why do they do that?
Cause your mandate?
I get a lot of energy.

231
00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.990
Like when I do the UFC,
like when I do commentary,
people say,
Oh,

232
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.490
it's all cooked up to accommodate [inaudible] and coked up doing commentary for

233
00:14:16.491 --> 00:14:19.700
the UFC.
My fucking head.
You were coked up at some point.

234
00:14:19.701 --> 00:14:23.630
You would come down though,
right?
I would imagine.
Yes.
So I've yet to see that.

235
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.800
Well,
during the,
I mean I come down after the event.
Boy,

236
00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:30.980
let me tell you like I used to do shows after the UFC,

237
00:14:30.981 --> 00:14:33.500
I'll do the UFC and then get out,
you know,

238
00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:37.970
10:00 PM in Vegas and then go to like the house of Blues,
do a midnight show.

239
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.920
But it was weird.
Too much energy,
like the energy that you put out when you're,

240
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.310
you're doing a commentary for like six hours of the UFC.
Yeah,
I'm,

241
00:14:47.311 --> 00:14:51.050
I'm on the whole time.
But it's natural.
And what do you FC is so intense.

242
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:51.980
I mean I think you

243
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:56.300
<v 3>probably could do golf coverage,
right?
And then go and do a comedy set.
Yes,</v>

244
00:14:56.460 --> 00:15:00.230
I've done coverage for pool actually.
And then gone to done comedy.

245
00:15:00.231 --> 00:15:01.630
No problem at all perhaps.

246
00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.330
But you have seen like the jolts of fucking headcase.

247
00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:10.940
You [inaudible] I hadn't been to a UFC since I was with you and it's like three

248
00:15:10.941 --> 00:15:14.780
or four years ago before I went to the 20th yeah.
And you know,

249
00:15:14.781 --> 00:15:18.080
and I know the 20th was pumped up.
I mean,
it was a pumped up event,

250
00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:21.620
but still when you go,
you forget if you haven't been to a UFC live,

251
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.760
it's like God,
there's nothing,
there's nothing like this.
Nothing really isn't.

252
00:15:25.761 --> 00:15:29.780
You know,
there's other great sporting events I've never been to,
uh,
you know,

253
00:15:29.781 --> 00:15:32.870
the Superbowl a and maybe it's like that,

254
00:15:32.871 --> 00:15:37.110
but there's just that feeling of anything can happen at the UFC still.
Yeah.

255
00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:40.310
Even though I'm no longer in charge and there's a lot,
there's a lot of changes.

256
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:45.420
It still has that environment,
like whoa.
A lot of variables.
Yeah.

257
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.250
MMA has a lot of areas.

258
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.000
<v 2>Well,
Lorenzo has a great saying.</v>

259
00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:53.860
He said that every event has an oh shit moment or where it happens and everybody

260
00:15:53.861 --> 00:15:57.280
just goes,
oh shit.
Oh Shit.
I mean,

261
00:15:57.281 --> 00:16:00.100
how many times have you seen a result of the UFC and you look over and you see

262
00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.080
fighters like John Jones or,
or,
you know,
Uriah Faber,
whoever it is,

263
00:16:05.081 --> 00:16:09.910
sitting,
watching the fight,
holding their head going,
Whoa,
oh shit.
Oh Shit.

264
00:16:09.911 --> 00:16:11.890
Like when Wii tour,
uh,

265
00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:14.650
and fought Anderson and Anderson Front kicked him in the face.

266
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.910
I remember the camera scanning the crowd and you saw all these like pro fighters

267
00:16:18.911 --> 00:16:22.040
going,
Oh shit,
oh,
you know,

268
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:26.920
that moment happened that yeah,
amazing stuff happens in a way,

269
00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:30.640
a sudden way that you're not going to get in a sport like basketball or baseball

270
00:16:30.641 --> 00:16:35.080
or football that has,
you know,
innings and round,
I mean innings and you know,

271
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:38.230
periods faking it in five seconds.
I mean,

272
00:16:38.231 --> 00:16:42.430
Duane Ludwig want to fight in five seconds,
you know,
and anything can happen.

273
00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:44.540
<v 3>I,
you know,
I think,
you know,
uh,</v>

274
00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:49.110
I've come to enjoy boxing much more than I ever have from the last few years.
Uh,

275
00:16:49.290 --> 00:16:51.940
basically I think,
cause I'm doing combat the Americas,
you know,

276
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:54.180
a Spanish version of the UFC,
if you will,

277
00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.420
and just been around a lot of boxing and I like it.
I really do.

278
00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.790
And when we started out,
you know,

279
00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:03.330
you remember it was a real us versus them mentality with boxing.
Right.

280
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.280
And I think that's mostly gone.

281
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:10.090
<v 2>Well,
the,
the Lou Dibella thing,
I had a thing with him on ESPN.
Well,
he's silly.</v>

282
00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:13.420
Here's the thing.
I mean,
everybody's like,
oh,
Joe Rogan hates boxing.

283
00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.310
And people like whenever boxing does well,

284
00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:18.740
people like tweet me things about like,
you guys blocked him.
He still did it.

285
00:17:18.741 --> 00:17:22.150
Still Dead Sport.
Fuck it.
You know,
send me these thing on Twitter,

286
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:26.260
Facebook or whatever.
But I'm boxing fan.
I buy every boxing in paper view.

287
00:17:26.261 --> 00:17:29.410
I watch every show time event.
I watch every HBO event.

288
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.140
That guy was just being a jerk off and when he was being a jerk off,

289
00:17:32.141 --> 00:17:35.440
I had a clown him but I what?
I said,

290
00:17:35.441 --> 00:17:37.890
I stand by one sec.

291
00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.290
<v 3>Genuis yeah,
he was being disingenuous.</v>

292
00:17:40.291 --> 00:17:44.940
He was not accepting the truth for what it is because it didn't fit in with his

293
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:45.600
worldview.

294
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.390
<v 2>Well,
he was also using the human cockfighting analogy.</v>

295
00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.040
You know the all wear pants.

296
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.110
I said that once to an ESPN reporter kind of shut that thing down.
He goes,

297
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:58.050
is this human cockfighting no,
they're all got,
they all have pants.

298
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:03.990
That's the perfect.
I'm going to steal that please.
It's a gift.

299
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.020
Thank you very much,
sir.
That's the perfect thing to say when they say that.

300
00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:11.370
That's such a dopey thing to say to no cock roosters don't know they're going to

301
00:18:11.371 --> 00:18:14.850
fight.
Okay.
There's a big person trains.

302
00:18:14.851 --> 00:18:18.180
They spend their whole life dedicated to learning these skills and then they

303
00:18:18.181 --> 00:18:22.950
test themselves at the very highest level.
He was at chess promoter.

304
00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:26.730
You might take that from him,
but he's a boxing promoter.

305
00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:30.660
It's not such a cerebral sport.
Right.
Not only that,
it's not,

306
00:18:30.690 --> 00:18:33.060
it's MMA boxing in it,

307
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.660
like the idea that it's a stupid saying,

308
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:41.250
you know like that or it's a stupid thought process that would allow someone to

309
00:18:41.251 --> 00:18:45.720
criticize or not like other effect of combat sports,
kickboxing.

310
00:18:45.930 --> 00:18:50.670
I'm a huge fan of kickbox like glory that's on spike.
I fucking,

311
00:18:50.671 --> 00:18:54.810
every time one of those on I tweeted,
I watch them all.
They're fun.
I mean,

312
00:18:54.811 --> 00:18:58.740
I'm a huge fan,
but just there's no taken down or glory.

313
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:02.370
She owns part of my company now.
Does he really?
Oh,
okay.
I didn't know that.

314
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:05.340
Pierre and around.
Okay.
I know they'll your rocks.
Are you kidding?

315
00:19:05.341 --> 00:19:07.870
You watch those fights I told,

316
00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:10.830
I told the UFC a long time ago.
I was like,

317
00:19:10.831 --> 00:19:14.120
you guys should buy k one k one was struggling,
but he actually won.

318
00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:16.920
It was hard to do though,
Joe.
Uh,
you know,
cause it was,

319
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:20.930
you know the guys with these fingers,
right?
Missy?
Yeah.

320
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.080
It was a lot of uh,
you know,
you go in a meeting and guys are missing fingers,

321
00:19:25.081 --> 00:19:29.320
so you go,
well then right after glory there was a,
it's showtime.

322
00:19:29.390 --> 00:19:32.220
It's show time,
put it on a lot of like really high level fights.

323
00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:36.390
And then there's lion fights in a,
in Vegas Moitai though.

324
00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.100
But still scale boxing.
Why I like really ties,
a lot of people don't know,

325
00:19:41.101 --> 00:19:43.470
like kickboxing,
they allow you leg kicks,

326
00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.760
but they usually have rules on how long you can hold the back of the guy's head

327
00:19:47.761 --> 00:19:51.540
in the clinch and they don't allow the elbows to the face.
Um,

328
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.820
so because of those limited rules,

329
00:19:53.821 --> 00:19:58.280
a lot of like the real moitai purest feel wear pants too.
No,
no,
no.

330
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.930
Can't do the human cockfighting.
You gotta wear shorts.

331
00:20:00.931 --> 00:20:05.520
Actually you can't wear pants.
But the um,
the elbows to the face in the clinch,

332
00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:07.410
it's,
that's an a really effective tool.

333
00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.800
I think it's a mistake to take that out and it's um,
you know,

334
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:13.470
glory by doing just straight punching and you know,

335
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:16.140
sort of Dutch style kickboxing touched it well,

336
00:20:16.141 --> 00:20:18.120
but then that then you can do it in New York and you know,

337
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:21.890
there is an advantage to those rules.
That's true.
That's true.
The elbow as well.

338
00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:26.200
And also the elbows.
Elbows are a very,
very effective weapons.

339
00:20:26.201 --> 00:20:30.390
Like I don't buy that elbows just cut people.
You know,
that was a,
a,

340
00:20:30.391 --> 00:20:31.770
an argument a while ago,

341
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:36.660
but the reality of a standing elbows is we're seeing them more and more used

342
00:20:36.661 --> 00:20:39.180
inside the octagon with incredible effectiveness.

343
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.180
Have you ever seen Jordan Meehan when he fought a Cyborg?

344
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:48.100
Did you ever see that he fought a know cyborg evangelists,
sta work.
Santo,

345
00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:52.480
<v 3>I know he was,
he nailed that.
The Americas,
we had him,
we had him demonstrate</v>

346
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.280
<v 1>me and m e I n versus a sideboard finished him off with this standing elbow</v>

347
00:20:59.251 --> 00:21:00.120
combination.

348
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:03.990
When you get to really see how effective a guy who really knows how to throw

349
00:21:03.991 --> 00:21:08.430
elbows can be,
so I think Gloria should probably leave,
you know,

350
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.980
the rules the way they are because they can get in New York.

351
00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:12.930
But if it wasn't for New York,

352
00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.120
I would say standing elbows and just Moitai rules in general.
There's,

353
00:21:17.121 --> 00:21:18.100
there's something like,

354
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:22.190
there's something important about the various uh,

355
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:27.230
various tools like grabbing the back of the neck and knee to the face and need

356
00:21:27.291 --> 00:21:31.650
to the body,
like using that plum clench and work in the body over.
It's a real,

357
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:32.491
it's real,
you know,

358
00:21:32.491 --> 00:21:36.180
it's real effective and you chop that down and don't allow the clench and then

359
00:21:36.181 --> 00:21:38.940
you chop it down further and don't allow elbows.
I mean,

360
00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:41.370
you get some great fights like all the k one fights.

361
00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.340
<v 3>Well,
I mean,
we're all,
you're hearkening back to the early days,
right?
I mean,
um,</v>

362
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.590
uh,
all the controversy aside,

363
00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:50.440
<v 1>finish this is the end.
Yeah.</v>

364
00:21:50.441 --> 00:21:53.650
He hit him with a body shot and then another left hook.
This,
Jordan,

365
00:21:53.651 --> 00:21:58.030
me and kit is a really badly this lead,
this combination,
the elbows.
One,
two,

366
00:21:58.031 --> 00:22:01.060
three,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.

367
00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:02.600
<v 3>It's fast.
It's slow motion.</v>

368
00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:07.480
<v 1>That's not slow motion.
What a combination of elbows.
I mean,</v>

369
00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:11.950
unbelievable elbow combination.
That was just fucking beautiful.

370
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:15.190
See that?
That's a,
that's real.
You need to do.

371
00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:19.140
<v 3>Yeah.
I can't even remember how we started Joe.
You know,
it wasn't,
everyone goes,</v>

372
00:22:19.141 --> 00:22:21.870
hey,
there are no rules.
One man in her six men leave,
you know,

373
00:22:21.871 --> 00:22:23.850
whatever we were saying,
but you know,

374
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:28.660
we couldn't figure out how to put the different fighting sports together.
Right.

375
00:22:28.770 --> 00:22:31.560
So w whose rules to use,
right?
I mean,

376
00:22:31.561 --> 00:22:36.330
and so really the basis of the UFC was always,
you know,

377
00:22:36.331 --> 00:22:41.280
no rules became,
you know,
this huge thing.
But it was also,
whose rules do you use?

378
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.250
I mean,
how are you going to get a boxer against the Jujitsu guy?

379
00:22:44.730 --> 00:22:47.310
What are you going to use?
You can't,
there's no rules you can use.

380
00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:52.210
<v 1>Did anybody try to gouge eyes?
Was that,
was that legal in the early one?</v>

381
00:22:52.410 --> 00:22:53.760
<v 3>Well,
you know,
you know what I mean?</v>

382
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:56.460
I always would hear about these wing Chun Masters.

383
00:22:56.461 --> 00:22:59.460
They'd had 50 ways to pop your eye out with their thumb.

384
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.060
And I kept calling them going,
bring your thumbs and do it,
man.

385
00:23:03.061 --> 00:23:06.360
Don't talk about it.
Come and pop everybody's I,
yeah,
I want you to have done,

386
00:23:06.361 --> 00:23:09.690
if a guy lost an eye though,
would you have done it?
Would we'd pick it up?

387
00:23:09.890 --> 00:23:14.100
What do you,
what would we do?
You know,
come on.

388
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.790
There's also,
there's a,
there's a reality to fighting that you know,

389
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.570
better than most people on the planet,
right?
If you're defending yourself,

390
00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:26.430
you're defending yourself.
Whether it's from a right hook,
you know,
right cross,

391
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:31.560
uh,
an elbow or a knee or having your eye guide gouged out,
you're blocking,

392
00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:33.060
you're,
you're aware.
You know,

393
00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:36.220
guy comes at you with his thumbs up to do the gouge.
You're,

394
00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.830
you're in a defensive position.

395
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:39.020
<v 1>Well,
it is interesting though,</v>

396
00:23:39.021 --> 00:23:43.070
how many people are getting poked in the eyes now when it's illegal and how

397
00:23:43.071 --> 00:23:47.810
often it happens and what you,
the reality of how devastating the results are.

398
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:51.160
When guys get their corneas scratched and they get a fingernail in the eye,

399
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:54.290
they get a finger jab in the eye.
Even if it's accidental,
man,

400
00:23:54.291 --> 00:23:56.360
they scream and run away and

401
00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.980
<v 4>eyes are sensitive.
Is it any different in other sports?
The same in football.</v>

402
00:23:59.981 --> 00:24:03.070
If someone gets their hand inside the helmet,
it's same.
You know boxing,

403
00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.590
you don't,
in the old days,
guys used to do stuff to the gloves versus

404
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.330
<v 1>Davey Moore.
He thumbed them in the eye and the,</v>

405
00:24:09.390 --> 00:24:10.860
well he was kicking his ass anyway,

406
00:24:10.861 --> 00:24:14.640
but Davey Moore couldn't see out of design then Roberto beat the fucking shit

407
00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:15.180
out of him.

408
00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.460
<v 4>So you know,
the UFC didn't invent this.</v>

409
00:24:17.650 --> 00:24:18.011
<v 1>No.</v>

410
00:24:18.011 --> 00:24:22.930
Thumbing is a long time strategy in boxing and they actually develop gloves that

411
00:24:22.931 --> 00:24:25.930
have the thumb pinned down because of that.
Because in the old days,

412
00:24:25.931 --> 00:24:28.990
the thumb would detach from,
from the,
uh,
the glove.

413
00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:32.200
And even when it's like stitched in a little bit,

414
00:24:32.201 --> 00:24:33.790
you could still kind of get it in there.

415
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.600
You can get it in there if you're just trying to poke a guy in the eye.

416
00:24:37.601 --> 00:24:40.570
Which many people did do.
That's a definitely

417
00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.840
<v 4>dirty trick.
Well it is a fight.
Yeah.</v>

418
00:24:42.841 --> 00:24:46.320
You know a guy man with shamrock quiz to who I've,
who did he fight?

419
00:24:46.321 --> 00:24:49.350
This was like UFC three or four.

420
00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:52.260
He said it maybe one of the preliminary,

421
00:24:52.261 --> 00:24:57.261
someone reached into his speedos and moved his cup out of the way so he could

422
00:24:57.781 --> 00:25:00.690
knee him and Kevin was going,
dude,
we're fighting,
you know,

423
00:25:00.691 --> 00:25:04.260
if you want to we can get together later.
But for right now,

424
00:25:04.261 --> 00:25:05.490
hands out of my speedos

425
00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:10.480
<v 1>fight between Gary Goodridge in the Pedro in Brazil.
Famous fight.</v>

426
00:25:10.481 --> 00:25:13.600
It was like straight up valley Tuto,
no gloves,
no rules.

427
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:17.830
And Gary Goodwood's reached into his fucking pants and grabbed his balls and

428
00:25:17.831 --> 00:25:18.664
crushed them.

429
00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:21.530
<v 4>He was in Gary.
Good.
Which was against that is the cock fight.
Yeah,</v>

430
00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.750
hardware we're talking was kept.
Pretty sure it was Gary Goodrich.

431
00:25:23.790 --> 00:25:27.950
That doesn't sound like his style,
but you know,
back in the day,
yeah.
Here,
let me,

432
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:29.330
well he was in arm wrestling champ,

433
00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:33.380
so maybe he figured that was playing to his strength.
He will yank your Franklin.

434
00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.770
This was,
I'm pretty sure it was Gary Goodrich.

435
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:38.900
<v 1>Yeah.
Garrett Goodrich versus the Pedro.</v>

436
00:25:39.050 --> 00:25:44.030
This was way back in the day from 1997.
And uh,

437
00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:48.840
<v 4>he uh,
yeah,
fishes grades and isn't back in the day.
Yes.</v>

438
00:25:48.841 --> 00:25:52.480
It is still back in the day to me.
Not to you while you were in retail,

439
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.650
you were in the game for four years by then.
Yeah.
Dude,

440
00:25:55.651 --> 00:25:57.990
he reached into his pants and fucking crushed his balls.

441
00:25:57.991 --> 00:26:01.170
You know what a Forrest Griffin said to me at the 20th anniversary,
he goes,

442
00:26:01.171 --> 00:26:04.320
he goes,
you know,
I love the early UFC.
He goes,
I would have entered earlier,

443
00:26:04.321 --> 00:26:07.650
but I didn't want to wear those speedos.
I wanted to wear a man's pants.

444
00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:13.360
That sounds like something for us with.
So when you guys first created,
yeah,

445
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:17.110
<v 1>the UFC in 1993.
How long did it take from the initial idea?</v>

446
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.500
<v 4>First paper view?
Whoa.
You know what,
nobody's ever asked me that Joe,
you know,
uh,</v>

447
00:26:22.770 --> 00:26:27.770
w art Davey called me to pitch me war of the worlds in April of 93 and we were

448
00:26:29.951 --> 00:26:33.580
on a November really?
So,
and you know,

449
00:26:33.581 --> 00:26:37.060
and you need three month lead time for pay per view.
So you know,
it was like,

450
00:26:37.090 --> 00:26:38.830
it was a go.
Wow.

451
00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:43.000
So you guys realized right away what a great idea this is going to be.
Oh it,

452
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:45.810
I realized that on arts call,
you know,

453
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.970
how can you not you same with you.
You saw it,
you loved it.
You know,

454
00:26:50.971 --> 00:26:54.370
I heard about it.
I,
I really did see it as alive,
you know,

455
00:26:54.371 --> 00:26:55.500
a real like mortal combat.

456
00:26:55.501 --> 00:26:59.460
That is really what I saw when I imagined what it would look like,
you know?

457
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.300
And I thought who would not watch that?
I'm watching it.
It's my show.

458
00:27:03.301 --> 00:27:08.250
I probably would pay myself to watch it.
I mean just how can you not watch that?

459
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:09.630
I got a board,
a,

460
00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:14.130
like I said in [inaudible] 94 I found the video of a UFC two and I don't think

461
00:27:14.131 --> 00:27:18.260
UFC one was even available on video.
Right?
Wasn't there substitute dispute?
No,
no,

462
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:21.540
no.
It wasn't a dispute.
But um,
don gold,
you know,

463
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.700
should we all know and love and it's still at the UFC,

464
00:27:23.910 --> 00:27:28.470
he bought two and at the same time bought one.

465
00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:33.510
Um,
and back in those days you try to release the videos to be fresh.

466
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:35.550
So he didn't want to release one before too.

467
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:39.360
We wanted to to be the first one come out very close to the event,

468
00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:43.770
all the Hoopla and then later on added one also,
as you know,

469
00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:48.600
one had arguably the worst commentator team in the history of sports.

470
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:53.250
Feel good,
Tim Brown.
Jim.
I like Jim Brown.

471
00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.510
Jim Brown was cool then I still think he's cool,
but what's super foot man?

472
00:27:57.511 --> 00:28:00.960
Super Moron.
You know,
how dare you?
How dare you.

473
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.390
Goddamn hero was a karate hero bill.

474
00:28:03.391 --> 00:28:07.560
Super Foot Wallace is that he's a karate hero.
I thought he was karate hero.

475
00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.790
Is that what he did?
Oh,
he was a bad ass.
Kickboxer did you not know lock sir?

476
00:28:11.791 --> 00:28:12.181
Of course.

477
00:28:12.181 --> 00:28:17.070
I knew I was standing backstage and I'm trying to explain to him the name of the

478
00:28:17.071 --> 00:28:21.210
show.
Right.
Which is not the ultimate fighting challenge.
I could,
you know,

479
00:28:21.211 --> 00:28:23.400
maybe it's just a subtle difference,
you know?

480
00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:26.430
But to me it meant a lot being chip versus challenge.

481
00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:31.610
I'm trying to explain it to him and he is practicing his kicks over my head.

482
00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.160
It's not,
I'm,
I'm not such a tall guy,
but he was a high kicker.
Right.

483
00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:38.090
So he's doing these kicks over my head as I'm going build,

484
00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:41.490
try to remember the name of the show.
So he's just showing off or something.

485
00:28:41.491 --> 00:28:44.400
What is he doing?
I think he was dead.
He being silly.
Yeah.

486
00:28:44.401 --> 00:28:48.090
And just showing he was too cool for school.
Yeah,
I got it.
And I said to him,

487
00:28:48.091 --> 00:28:50.250
I go,
we're going to see any kicks like that.
And he goes,

488
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:54.180
I know you do that in a real fight.
They'll rip your balls off.
I'm like,
dude,

489
00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:58.500
isn't that what you teach
now?
He's a jerk off.

490
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:01.860
He's not a hero.
He's a jerk off.
You know what he did,
Joe?

491
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:04.980
There's only a couple where there's actually more than a couple of people.
I'm,

492
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:09.390
you know,
maybe still annoyed that back then before email,

493
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.950
right when you wanted to communicate something,
you had to write it down,

494
00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.090
put it in an envelope,
use a government issued like form of sticker thing.

495
00:29:18.090 --> 00:29:22.080
You put on an envelope and you sent it through a government process and it was

496
00:29:22.081 --> 00:29:24.750
called the mail.
Right.
Okay.
So there is no email.

497
00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:29.940
So bill super foot shows up,
gets the name wrong,
burps into the thing,

498
00:29:29.941 --> 00:29:33.540
pays no attention,
does a horrible job,
takes the money.

499
00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.680
And then like three days later in black belt magazine and editorial comes out

500
00:29:37.681 --> 00:29:39.150
how he says he's totally against it.

501
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:43.750
So he must have written that before he died six weeks before,

502
00:29:44.610 --> 00:29:48.370
you know,
so he just did it for the check.
I,
he did it.
Uh,
I dunno.

503
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.400
I mean it wasn't that big a check.
There's probably 2,500 bucks.
I mean,

504
00:29:51.401 --> 00:29:53.890
if that was life changing for him,
he's in bad shape,

505
00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.630
but I think he didn't like it,
didn't it?

506
00:29:56.670 --> 00:30:00.820
I like a lot of the guys that I think of his paper Tigers [inaudible] right.

507
00:30:00.850 --> 00:30:05.350
I think it was a threat.
Well you can't call bill super foot walls.
A paper.

508
00:30:05.351 --> 00:30:09.160
Tiger bill super foot walls was a great kick boxer.
He really was.
He,

509
00:30:09.161 --> 00:30:11.970
I saw him fight live.
He was a bad ass kick boxer.

510
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.110
I saw him fight live deep into his forties.

511
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:18.460
He came out of an era of kickboxing when they're really,

512
00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:21.310
when it really was a great thing to watch.
Right.

513
00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:25.180
And he was a great kick boxer from the Chuck Norris.
Yeah,
absolutely.

514
00:30:25.181 --> 00:30:30.000
And there was a bunch of guys,
what's his name?
Um,
uh,
Rick.
Rufus.
Rufus.

515
00:30:30.001 --> 00:30:34.640
Yeah.
I tried to get him,
uh,
uh,
Benny the jet or key.

516
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.450
Yeah.

517
00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:39.190
I mean I was after all these guys and it was just a little bit too late in the

518
00:30:39.190 --> 00:30:43.210
day for them.
Right.
Benny Benny was,
they were retired and you know,

519
00:30:43.211 --> 00:30:46.270
and you're right,
I shouldn't go off like that as a kickboxer.

520
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.940
He was something he really just didn't enjoy working with them.

521
00:30:48.970 --> 00:30:51.850
I didn't enjoy working with them.
I thought it was bullshit to show up.

522
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.750
Ready to condemn something or already have condemned it and not paying enough

523
00:30:55.751 --> 00:31:00.250
attention to get the name right and something that was his history making as our

524
00:31:00.251 --> 00:31:02.410
first event.
But anyway,
we'll now he met her,

525
00:31:02.411 --> 00:31:04.930
they were horrible because it just goes down in the record books.

526
00:31:04.931 --> 00:31:08.020
That's the worst commentating team of all time.
Well,

527
00:31:08.021 --> 00:31:10.630
it goes down as the beginning and everything's,
I mean,

528
00:31:10.631 --> 00:31:13.990
I sucked when I first started doing it too.
It just,
no one,

529
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.350
no one had any background in it.
No one knew what to do.
You know?
You know,

530
00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.210
I didn't know about your fighting background when I asked your manager to do it.

531
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.550
What I liked was your comedy style.

532
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:28.330
I liked your persona and when I talked to Jeff,
he goes,
you know,

533
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:31.540
he was a kickboxer or something,
you know,
I forgot what he said.
It was like,

534
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:34.420
it wasn't very specific.
I was like,
really?
He was a fight.

535
00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:37.300
That's how I found out about it.
But I always thought you were,

536
00:31:37.330 --> 00:31:41.950
you had a tough guy persona that seem very right for the show and we needed

537
00:31:41.951 --> 00:31:42.281
someone,

538
00:31:42.281 --> 00:31:47.230
God knows that could talk when all hell was breaking loose because hell broke

539
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:48.790
loose pretty regularly in those days.

540
00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:52.600
You had a couple guys that were doing the post fight interviews that just

541
00:31:52.601 --> 00:31:57.280
weren't so good at it.
They just weren't so good at media.
Like Tony Blauer,

542
00:31:57.281 --> 00:32:01.270
who's a really good martial artist and he's a lot about self defense and we had

543
00:32:01.271 --> 00:32:06.271
to choose between people that sorta knew what was going on and real announcers.

544
00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:09.070
Right.
I mean that was the choice because we couldn't find anyone.

545
00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.330
Do you know Brian Kilmeade?
You know,
started out doing this too.
Is Brian?
Me?

546
00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.750
He's on a show called Fox and friends.
You know,

547
00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:20.140
it's like you started out doing this.
He did.
Oh,

548
00:32:20.141 --> 00:32:24.730
I know exactly what that guy is through five I think.
And Brian,

549
00:32:24.731 --> 00:32:28.060
if you're listening or anyone knows Brian,
I'm sorry if I got the number wrong,

550
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:32.510
but you know,
and Bruce back.
Excellent.
Good.
[inaudible] Nick,

551
00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:36.850
you know Bruce,
back to this day,
I owe a,
Bruce had debt of gratitude.

552
00:32:36.851 --> 00:32:38.410
He gave me some really good pointers.

553
00:32:38.411 --> 00:32:40.640
When I first started doing the post fight interviews.

554
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:43.250
He gave me some real good pointers on like,
you know,

555
00:32:43.251 --> 00:32:47.150
like what to say or what to save.
You're stuck and you know,
like how did he,

556
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:51.280
he's a pro and he's a really good guy in jail.
So did Blotnick you know?
Yeah.

557
00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:56.060
He'd have great guy.
That was good.
Yeah.
Olympic gold medalist,

558
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:59.450
I mean,
awesome do to really,
really,
he was a great guy.

559
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:02.660
It's so sad when he passed.
I really miss that guy.

560
00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.790
He was a really fun guy to do a commentary with two,
just to real genuine,

561
00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:10.640
nice person.
Gotta be around,
had this

562
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.620
like before the show or backstage or if there was any problem.

563
00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:20.420
He was unflappable and it just kind of gave off a calm.
Sure.

564
00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:24.660
It sort of help cause like not everybody on the team was calm.
Right,
right,
right.

565
00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.570
He was,
he was a great wrestler to knew a lot about wrestling,
you know,

566
00:33:29.571 --> 00:33:32.660
and eventually developed his knowledge of a MMA,

567
00:33:32.661 --> 00:33:35.390
Jujitsu skills and was really interested in learning.
You know,

568
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.750
I remember there's some videos of him rolling with frank shamrock like very,

569
00:33:38.751 --> 00:33:43.550
very early in the day back,
I think when frank was the champion and a,
you know,

570
00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:45.490
it's about the time of it.
Yeah.
I mean,

571
00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.920
I left right when frank one,

572
00:33:49.310 --> 00:33:52.670
when he beat Kevin Jackson an Armbar them in Japan.

573
00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:55.610
I didn't go to the Japan show.
That was when I quit.
I was like,
that's,

574
00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.540
when did you quit?
About 98.
Somewhere around then,

575
00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.800
which is right about on when frank won the title of c at that point I would

576
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:08.180
[inaudible] I really was.
It was,
it was weird for me too.
It's like,
it's um,

577
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:09.030
you know,

578
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:13.580
it was all these little tiny propeller planes to these strange places,

579
00:34:13.890 --> 00:34:18.290
Augusta,
Georgia and doeth.
And that wasn't,
you know,
I kind of liked the Gusto.
I,

580
00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.990
you know,
I mean,
that wasn't bad.
Good Barbecue.
Yeah.

581
00:34:20.991 --> 00:34:24.290
Good Barbecue and somewhat friendly town.
You know,

582
00:34:24.390 --> 00:34:28.250
only supposed to Charlotte where they invited me never to return.

583
00:34:29.150 --> 00:34:33.140
The chief of police said to me,
if you come back,
I'm not sure what,

584
00:34:33.141 --> 00:34:36.410
I will arrest you for it,
but I guarantee you I will arrest you.
Wow.

585
00:34:36.411 --> 00:34:41.150
What year was this of police?
What year was this?
Well,
that would have been five.

586
00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:45.530
So 95.
Wow.

587
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.730
What a Dick.
The chief of police and it's like a guy and it's the same.

588
00:34:49.731 --> 00:34:53.870
Do you remember his name?
Dick something.
Hey Dick,
go fuck.
We eat,

589
00:34:53.871 --> 00:34:58.340
I think dick weed.
Oh No.

590
00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.230
What is that going to remember the,
I mean,
come on.
What a crazy abusive power.

591
00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.740
It all,
it's all good now because John McCain said he would have ventured to him.

592
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.730
Now it's okay because the war here,
I said it's okay.
You know,
it wasn't me.

593
00:35:10.731 --> 00:35:12.110
You know,
Mccain,
I've said this before,

594
00:35:12.111 --> 00:35:15.620
like I was sort of hoping Jerry Falwell or somebody would come out against,

595
00:35:15.621 --> 00:35:19.050
you know,
somebody I could take,
you know,
a war hero and,
you know,

596
00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:20.810
powerful senator.
But you know,

597
00:35:20.811 --> 00:35:24.410
who was really a tough opponent to counter was that,
um,

598
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:28.250
the senator from Colorado that it had the judo champion.

599
00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.750
He'd been an Olympic judo con.
Um,
Ben,
he was native American.

600
00:35:32.751 --> 00:35:37.260
Ben Light Horse Campbell and Nighthorse Campbell.
I don't know.
He is,

601
00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:38.850
I'm never heard this before.
You know,

602
00:35:38.910 --> 00:35:42.990
because we were kind of intimating that McCain didn't really know anything about

603
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:43.824
the martial arts.

604
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:49.190
And he went and found Ben who was an Olympic gold medalist in judo or a

605
00:35:49.321 --> 00:35:53.190
medalist.
He might not have been gold.
And he said,
yeah,
well that's no good.

606
00:35:53.191 --> 00:35:55.380
You can't do,
you can't do sail boats.
What are you thinking?

607
00:35:55.890 --> 00:35:59.790
Can't use elbow or whatever.
He said,
who knows,
whatever the,
whatever it was,

608
00:35:59.791 --> 00:36:01.560
he didn't like the early opponents.

609
00:36:01.561 --> 00:36:03.600
And that was all for a lot of folks that don't know,

610
00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:06.840
this is where it gets weird with John Mccain,
John Mccain's wife,

611
00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.950
their family was involved with Budweiser.
Right.
And he was,

612
00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:15.930
the Budweiser was in bed with boxing and boxing was in bed with the UFC.

613
00:36:15.931 --> 00:36:20.310
Now,
I mean [inaudible] 93 so I don't really think that's the connection.

614
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:24.960
I don't think that's what it was.
It was,
I think it's odd.
I mean John Mccain,

615
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.630
you know,
is a Republican,

616
00:36:27.631 --> 00:36:31.730
so republicans tend to stand for state control right at,
you know,

617
00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:35.670
keeping a small federal government.
That's kind of a Republican policy.

618
00:36:36.030 --> 00:36:40.050
But I think John Mccain really wanted a national boxing commission and I think

619
00:36:40.051 --> 00:36:41.880
that this was a good way to promote that.

620
00:36:41.881 --> 00:36:46.530
And I think he just was generally offended by the UFC and I think it was a great

621
00:36:46.531 --> 00:36:50.430
way to get press and it wasn't like people were coming out and going,

622
00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:52.860
keep the you will to keep the,
you know,

623
00:36:52.861 --> 00:36:57.440
he just could beat on the UFC and get as much press as he wanted and look,
look,

624
00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:59.010
look how different America is now.

625
00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:04.020
I mean back then that was the biggest problem facing the u s was the UFC.

626
00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:08.160
I mean now look at the problems facing America and the world and you go,

627
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.550
we really lived in kind of a magical time.
You know,

628
00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.960
what do you mean the UFC was the only problem?
The United States as well.

629
00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.510
You not reading the news in 1993 the word?
Well,

630
00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:21.390
there's always things going on overseas.

631
00:37:21.391 --> 00:37:26.330
There's always things going on that had you heard of Osama bin Laden in 1993 and

632
00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:29.730
know that sense of gassed and that was a Russian problem.
Yeah,

633
00:37:29.731 --> 00:37:32.820
that was the mujahideen back then.
Yeah.
They were fighting the Russians,

634
00:37:32.821 --> 00:37:36.960
so they were cool with us.
Yeah.
I think Clinton years,
the economy was good.

635
00:37:36.961 --> 00:37:38.850
I mean he got,
you know,
he did build the intern.

636
00:37:38.851 --> 00:37:41.880
I mean that was like the biggest thing.
Or she did a them or whatever.

637
00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.700
I wasn't paying it.
Yeah,
that was the biggest issue.
Well,

638
00:37:44.730 --> 00:37:47.020
I'm sure that what I was going to say.
I mean,
what I mean is there,

639
00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:49.560
there was certainly other problems in the world.

640
00:37:49.561 --> 00:37:52.260
There's some violence and all sorts of things and are not,

641
00:37:52.261 --> 00:37:54.950
if you were reading the media apparently,
you know,
it was,

642
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:59.400
well maybe it was you because you were really close to it too,
you know?

643
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:04.050
I'll tell you what,
for me it was,
uh,
you know,
it was riding the tiger,

644
00:38:04.051 --> 00:38:07.350
right.
Because,
you know,
it was great to be in mad magazine.

645
00:38:07.710 --> 00:38:12.270
It was great to be the final episode of friends when Courtney Cox's boyfriend,

646
00:38:12.271 --> 00:38:16.220
Anders the UFC and goes into it.
It was great to be in virtuosity,
you know,

647
00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:20.340
the Denzel Washington Russell Crowe movie.
I mean,
there's a bit,
there's big 95.

648
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:24.030
I mean,
it's really big media stuff,
but on the other hand,

649
00:38:24.031 --> 00:38:27.830
when you're that visible,
you know,
you're making a lot of people angry if they,

650
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.240
if they don't like you,
you're in their face all the time.

651
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:34.590
So it was kind of a tough thing.
So,
yeah,
I mean it was fun until it wasn't.

652
00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.010
Um,
and you,

653
00:38:36.010 --> 00:38:40.690
<v 3>I mean,
you know the story we were,
we had backed off that marketing and where,</v>

654
00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.560
you know,
the unified rules,
you know,
we're coming into place and you know,

655
00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:45.070
it was a very

656
00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:47.670
<v 1>difference,
well for a lot of folks who don't know what we're talking about,</v>

657
00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.410
when the UFC first came out,

658
00:38:49.411 --> 00:38:53.370
there were no way classes and there were no rules and you could not,
you know,

659
00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.620
a fighter could tap,
they could,

660
00:38:55.650 --> 00:38:59.040
but the no one could throw in the towel and the referee couldn't stop them.

661
00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.630
<v 3>But that was on one at changed by two.
That was insane</v>

662
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:06.540
<v 1>by the way.
Yeah,
that was insane.
Okay,
so what is this sort of highlights it.</v>

663
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:10.980
So that's the first episode,
the first UFC,
and then from there,

664
00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:14.850
slowly but surely rules start becoming implemented.
Strategies,

665
00:39:14.851 --> 00:39:19.680
change rounds,
um,
weight classes,
gloves,
things got really interesting,

666
00:39:19.681 --> 00:39:22.260
really fast.
And I'll think a lot of people were unaware of it.

667
00:39:22.261 --> 00:39:27.060
If you think about the difference between 93 and 97 I came in in [inaudible] 97

668
00:39:27.061 --> 00:39:30.690
when v tour made his debut gloves.
We're still not mandatory.

669
00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:35.840
They were optional.
Some fighters fought without gloves.
Um,
but it was,

670
00:39:35.841 --> 00:39:36.650
it wasn't that the case.

671
00:39:36.650 --> 00:39:41.450
<v 3>Yeah.
I was against gloves after I saw tank knock out.
What's his name man to uh,</v>

672
00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.970
um,
tank was smart.
He figured out he goes gloves or a weapon.
I'm bringing them.

673
00:39:47.330 --> 00:39:50.150
<v 1>Yeah,
you get hit harder with gloves,
a lot harder.
You can hit harder.</v>

674
00:39:50.151 --> 00:39:52.610
You don't worry about breaking your hands.
There's a,

675
00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.260
and all the wraps and everything,

676
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:57.950
they give you a much better thing to hit with bare knuckles.
Tricky.

677
00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.980
If you hit someone in the knuckle with bare knuckles on your forehead,

678
00:40:01.010 --> 00:40:03.770
you can break your hand very easily.
It's a really common,

679
00:40:03.771 --> 00:40:05.690
especially if you catch them with the last two knuckles,

680
00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:08.130
the ones that vibe where you,
where your pinky is,
your head.

681
00:40:08.131 --> 00:40:09.020
That was the most common

682
00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:12.390
<v 3>jury in the earthquake in hand.
You know,
on the Gracies wear.
Like wear gloves,</v>

683
00:40:12.391 --> 00:40:15.540
don't wear gloves where I had,
I don't care.
You know,
whatever you want,

684
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:16.680
<v 1>where fast.</v>

685
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.040
We don't care if someone else is wearing gloves and you're grappling with them,

686
00:40:20.041 --> 00:40:21.720
you actually can hold onto the gloves.

687
00:40:21.750 --> 00:40:25.440
I mean if there's a no rules about it and guys use the gloves to finish

688
00:40:25.441 --> 00:40:29.670
submissions now too.
They started doing a lot of that.
A lot of guys.
Um,
um,

689
00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:33.510
the way Josh Thomson finished off,
uh,

690
00:40:34.890 --> 00:40:36.690
who was it?
Um,

691
00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:39.570
<v 5>uh,</v>

692
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:45.940
<v 1>Ryan,
he,
Pat Heeley thing was pat Heeley.
No,
not pat Heeley.
Yeah,</v>

693
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.090
it was,
I think it was Josh Thompson and Pat Heeley.
Anyway,
he,
uh,

694
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.510
he grabs the glove as he's finishing the rear naked choke.

695
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:56.080
Like he's gone for the rear naked and he switches to palm to palm and then he

696
00:40:56.081 --> 00:40:59.750
grabs the glove and use this as the glove to finish it off.
And I was like,
Huh.

697
00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.330
I was like,
that's slick.
Well,
it's totally legal.
Yeah,

698
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:06.070
it's totally legal to grab your own glove and Tulsa totally legal to grab your

699
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:06.791
own shorts,

700
00:41:06.791 --> 00:41:10.540
which is kind of interesting because one of the best ways to defend against

701
00:41:10.541 --> 00:41:13.120
Camorra's is to just grab the inside of your shorts,

702
00:41:13.121 --> 00:41:15.190
like by your crotch and just hang on for dear life.

703
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.830
<v 3>I mean,
the Gracies always used the g for that type of effect.
You don't,
you know,</v>

704
00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:21.230
I'm sitting here,
I'm watching you do this right.

705
00:41:21.231 --> 00:41:23.510
And I was watching your brain try to find that,
you know,

706
00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:28.160
find out opponent and you know you are,
you're a renaissance man of tough guys.

707
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:31.010
<v 1>You know,
that's what you are,</v>

708
00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.400
<v 3>you know,
cause your comedy is like that.
You've acted</v>

709
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:38.000
<v 4>as a tough guy.
You do comedy from a tough guy,
point of view.
And you know,</v>

710
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:39.980
I think you've probably,
is this true?

711
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.610
I think you've probably seen more MMA than anyone on the planet up close.

712
00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:48.630
<v 1>Maybe Joe Silva seen more than me because I've seen him.
He's over there.</v>

713
00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:50.100
He's got his hands over his eyes.

714
00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:54.870
It was Pat Healey who it was definitely Pat Heeley.
Josh Thomson fought.
Um,

715
00:41:55.110 --> 00:42:00.030
yeah man,
look,
I've seen a lot of up close.
I've been to,

716
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:03.990
I don't know how many events,
but I've seen well,
well over a thousand fights,

717
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:08.110
like up close and personal and some of the best fights in the history of MMA in

718
00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:12.000
the history of Joe Silva goes,
saw the Fox sports one events as well.
Now,

719
00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.270
like over the last two years,
he's outpaced me.
It used to be,
we would all,

720
00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:19.410
we would not see the same amount of fights over the last two years.

721
00:42:19.411 --> 00:42:23.100
I don't really do those Fox sports one ones as much anymore.

722
00:42:23.101 --> 00:42:27.150
I do Fox and the paper view and then the Anik Florian team does the,
uh,

723
00:42:27.151 --> 00:42:28.680
the other one.
But uh,

724
00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:32.370
so Joe Silva might be the only guy on the planet that seem more fights than me

725
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:36.540
unless,
you know,
really hardcore fans.
There's some fucking psychos out there.

726
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:39.190
I've seen everything,
every local show.
It's hard.

727
00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.370
I think Joe fits into that category.
He's a psycho.

728
00:42:42.371 --> 00:42:47.070
Joe Silva is a real MMA fan.
That fucker loves MMA.
Yeah.
Here it is.

729
00:42:47.071 --> 00:42:51.420
This is Josh Thompson finishing off Pat Heeley put up beautiful technique too.

730
00:42:51.421 --> 00:42:55.620
He's got the body triangle and then he's using,
it's hard to tell here.

731
00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:59.910
Nope,
that's palm to palm.
I'm wrong.
That's just a regular palm to palm grip.

732
00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:04.530
I stand corrected unless he finishes it in a different way and pulls the gloves.

733
00:43:04.531 --> 00:43:06.540
I definitely have seen someone do it before.

734
00:43:07.410 --> 00:43:10.230
I don't know why I thought I thought it was Josh because Josh is a very clever

735
00:43:10.231 --> 00:43:15.070
guy.
He's a the point stands.
It's a good move at that point.

736
00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:19.500
Does it fucking Badass technique though?
Let me say no,

737
00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:24.150
I couldn't tell if he did it there.
Is that John pulled out yet?

738
00:43:24.151 --> 00:43:28.140
I was John McCarthy.
No,
no.
He's wearing a microphone.
You Fuck Jesus Christ.

739
00:43:28.890 --> 00:43:31.860
It's like as he's finishing this off with a bar.
That's another thing too.

740
00:43:31.861 --> 00:43:36.000
That's changed over the years.
That body triangle man,
guys,
uh Oh yeah,

741
00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:40.920
he doing it.
He is doing it.
He was doing it at the end.
See my memory is good.

742
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:45.030
Thought my memory fails me.
Josh Thompson is a bad motherfucker.

743
00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:50.340
<v 4>Could you do too?
You know,
so much of the fighting has changed.
I mean it's,
yeah,</v>

744
00:43:50.341 --> 00:43:54.680
it's incredible,
right?
It's,
it's really,
it's,
it's like,
you know,

745
00:43:54.681 --> 00:43:57.030
like even when you see old films of the,
you know,

746
00:43:57.031 --> 00:44:00.290
the NFL back in the leather Helmer football on the leather element days,

747
00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:04.470
you know,
football hasn't,
I mean the UFC changed more.
Y'All hit 20 years.
I mean,

748
00:44:04.471 --> 00:44:09.420
it's remarkable.
But yet you and Joe Silver still there.
Yeah.
That's weird.
Yeah.

749
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:13.590
It changed radically.
And I brought both you guys in.
You did.
You did.

750
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:19.040
<v 1>I was,
uh,
the post fight interviewer,
I'd never done any commentary ever.
Um,</v>

751
00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:23.800
I had done commentary for more time.
Um,
but I'd never done talk or,

752
00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:27.200
well yeah,
but it's still,
you have to learn how to do it.

753
00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:31.710
<v 4>Absolutely.
And you've got a lot better.
Right?
Oh,
for sure.
I was in the beginning.</v>

754
00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:32.190
It's,

755
00:44:32.190 --> 00:44:37.050
<v 1>um,
but you were better in the beginning people that we brought in on that first.</v>

756
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.010
Oh yeah.
Maybe while we're in a serious upgrade,
I had a,
the,

757
00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:44.910
the benefit of a,
first of all of watching them make mistakes,

758
00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:46.620
that's a huge benefit.
Enough.

759
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:50.490
And then the other benefit was I was a huge fan and always have been,

760
00:44:50.491 --> 00:44:54.780
I've been a fan since that tape that I picked up at that Hollywood video store.

761
00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:57.960
Uh,
and that was two.
That was notice number two.
Yeah.

762
00:44:57.961 --> 00:45:02.760
And then I started training fuck out was,
I started training soon after that.

763
00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:07.710
Um,
and uh,
I remember thinking,
man,
this is a,
I hope this works out.
You know,

764
00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:08.790
I hope this takes off.

765
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:12.360
Cause I remember when I looked at the very box that had the UFC on it,

766
00:45:12.361 --> 00:45:15.360
the first time I found out about the UFC,
I looked that box and went,
wow,

767
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.070
they did it.
They did it.

768
00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:19.800
Because this is something that everybody in MMA had talked about,

769
00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:23.370
I should say MMA,
everyone in martial arts,
and they were our,

770
00:45:23.371 --> 00:45:27.300
no martial arts anymore.
There's styles,
but everything is essentially in my eyes,

771
00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:32.640
MMA is martial arts now.
It's not,
I mean these ideas or martial arts.
Yeah.

772
00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.121
Yeah.
I mean,

773
00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:36.240
I think they're still teaching kids tae kwon do and there's nothing wrong with

774
00:45:36.241 --> 00:45:40.410
it.
There's nothing wrong with it.
No.
But martial arts is MMA,
you know,

775
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:44.970
it is martial arts.
And,
um,
when we were coming up,

776
00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.200
like I was a taekwondo guy and you know,
I had friends that did that,
did karate,

777
00:45:49.201 --> 00:45:52.230
and I had another friend that did this and everyone always wanted to know what

778
00:45:52.231 --> 00:45:55.410
was the best.
And you didn't know.
You really had no idea.

779
00:45:55.411 --> 00:45:59.670
You had no idea until the UFC came along.
It was all just speculation.

780
00:45:59.670 --> 00:46:04.670
And everyone was convinced that their style of judo was unstoppable or there

781
00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:07.980
showed,
oh,
con was the best death touch and you know,

782
00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:12.330
whatever it was every,
it was all just shit talking and guesswork.

783
00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:16.440
But when I looked at that box,
I remember very clearly thinking in my head,
wow,

784
00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.280
they fucking did it.

785
00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:20.340
They actually did it like this was the thing that everybody always talked about,

786
00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.800
getting everybody together,
make them Duke it out.

787
00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.300
Kuma taste style like a fucking John Claude van Damme movie in a cage.

788
00:46:27.330 --> 00:46:30.750
But even better because he was in a cage.
But we'll have to gun two.

789
00:46:30.751 --> 00:46:35.040
But I would tell people when I was working for you guys,
I was a on news radio,

790
00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:36.510
which is an NBC Sitcom.

791
00:46:36.690 --> 00:46:40.110
Fortunately News radio was not doing well and wasn't popular,

792
00:46:40.111 --> 00:46:42.900
so the network didn't come up to me and go,
hey,
fuck head,
what are you doing?

793
00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:46.860
Cage fighting and commentator for the advertisers are very uncomfortable with

794
00:46:46.861 --> 00:46:47.694
your side Gig.

795
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.490
They didn't have any problem because that show could have been canceled every

796
00:46:51.490 --> 00:46:55.140
year.
Almost got cancer.
It's a good show,
Joe.
It was a very good show.

797
00:46:55.141 --> 00:46:56.670
It was a very good show,
good character,

798
00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:00.900
but we didn't have the benefit of political backing.
So we got moved a lot.

799
00:47:00.990 --> 00:47:04.720
And uh,
it was never like a guarantee,

800
00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.150
but when I was doing it,
people would talk to me like I was doing porn.

801
00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.180
They would talk to me like I was off like shooting porn on the weekend.

802
00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:15.210
They're like,
what are you doing?
You doing cage funny.
Why are you doing that?

803
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.180
Why are you,
why are you interviewing cage fighters?
I was like,

804
00:47:18.181 --> 00:47:21.030
I like watching it and people would look at you like,

805
00:47:21.031 --> 00:47:24.030
there's something wrong with you for liking.
Once I like watching a dude,

806
00:47:24.031 --> 00:47:27.230
I'm telling you,
man,
I got seriously judged by,

807
00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.160
by people in the industry back then

808
00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.660
<v 2>when it was not popular at all.</v>

809
00:47:32.650 --> 00:47:34.640
<v 3>When I moved to Larchmont,</v>

810
00:47:34.641 --> 00:47:38.240
which is a snooty little town in Westchester outside of New York,
my wife goes,

811
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:42.290
<v 2>please don't tell anyone what you do.
You know,
the UFC had paid for the house.</v>

812
00:47:43.070 --> 00:47:47.750
She goes,
please don't please if you could not bring it up.
Yeah.
It's,

813
00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:53.000
it's much,
much,
much,
much,
much more acceptable now.
I mean,
no,
absolutely not.
Fox,

814
00:47:53.001 --> 00:47:54.200
it's a,
you know,

815
00:47:54.201 --> 00:47:58.910
it's rumored to be an Olympic sport in the making so well that would make sense.

816
00:47:59.060 --> 00:48:00.350
But you know,

817
00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:05.680
if you have curling as an Olympic sport might be your people.

818
00:48:05.931 --> 00:48:10.190
You Canadian well Scottish,
which is oh,
the Scottish curl as well.
Right?

819
00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.140
Well they invented curling and,

820
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:16.220
and the Canadians are Scottish because you know that drink Canada dry.

821
00:48:16.221 --> 00:48:19.880
The Scots thought that was a challenge.
So they all went to drink Canada dry,

822
00:48:19.881 --> 00:48:23.060
you know,
that's,
oh,
it's an old joke or sorry,

823
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.290
the three Scottish listeners you have are busting a gut right now though.

824
00:48:27.291 --> 00:48:29.240
I love the Canada dry material.

825
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:33.380
I was on a one of those shows like best damn sports show or something like that.

826
00:48:33.381 --> 00:48:37.310
Way,
way,
way back in the day.
And uh,
I was telling them,
I said,

827
00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.440
I think it's going to be an enormous national sport one day.

828
00:48:39.441 --> 00:48:42.550
And they were laughing.
They thought it was hilarious.
You know,

829
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:45.950
there's a lot of stick and ball guys in the sports business that still are

830
00:48:45.951 --> 00:48:49.640
waiting for it to go away.
Like they don't like rock and roll or hip hop either.

831
00:48:49.670 --> 00:48:53.450
Well there was some shit head on.
Um,
who does amateur football.

832
00:48:53.451 --> 00:48:56.380
He does college football.
And he was talking about a,

833
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:59.840
after Anderson Silva broke his leg that this is the reason why he would never

834
00:48:59.841 --> 00:49:01.880
cover the UFC.
Never has never will.

835
00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:04.610
You know in MMA from chair what was the friends,

836
00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.670
because Anderson broke his leg because this leg got broken.
Exactly.

837
00:49:07.671 --> 00:49:10.970
And I'm like he's,
he works in football.
Football guy.
Yeah.

838
00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:14.330
He's college football.
They don't even make money.

839
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:20.530
They're getting head injuries for free and the colleges are making billions of

840
00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:24.580
dollars.
While the are no rules guys not commenting on other sports.
Joe,
I just,

841
00:49:24.590 --> 00:49:27.770
I'm not doing that.
I had the no rules guy,
those guys,

842
00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:32.230
those put those fucking higher moral ground sports guys there.

843
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:33.400
Yeah.
You,

844
00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:36.280
<v 3>but you know,
there's a real reason for it.
And it is.</v>

845
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:38.890
And if you look at the NFL,
you know the,

846
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:43.920
with NFL films that turned the sport into heroic endeavor and I think NFL films

847
00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:50.020
was really changing in,

848
00:49:50.021 --> 00:49:53.110
in the media business and then the sports business cause they turn football into

849
00:49:53.111 --> 00:49:58.111
this epic story and it became very advertiser friendly and you know,

850
00:49:58.390 --> 00:50:00.790
ends up in,
you know,
the Superbowl,

851
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.850
which is the most advertiser friendly thing in the planet.
Right.

852
00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:08.770
So I think that whole thing was built out and anything that rocks the boat,

853
00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.630
the way we rock the boat with boxing,

854
00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:15.660
when Tyson was moved from paper view to Fox opposite the ultimate ultimate back

855
00:50:17.051 --> 00:50:19.840
in the day there hadn't been a heavyweight boxing match on broadcast.

856
00:50:19.841 --> 00:50:23.770
And I think 16 years and strangely Tyson has put up against,

857
00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.800
are a tournament of champions.
You know,
that's not a coincidence.

858
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:32.690
So I think when you're protecting something,
you know,
it's a siege mentality.

859
00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:37.720
And I think a lot of the pure sports guys still feel a little bit threatened by

860
00:50:37.761 --> 00:50:38.594
the UFC.

861
00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:42.190
<v 2>Well you better tell Dana White Cause Dana White,
we'll put shows on.
Well,</v>

862
00:50:42.191 --> 00:50:43.420
he used to always do that.

863
00:50:43.450 --> 00:50:48.450
Put Us bike shows on opposite of affliction or opposite of Dana.

864
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.770
You know,
he likes to go to war.
You know,
I,
I am,
uh,

865
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:57.610
I am the number one Dana Fan.
I got to say,
it's like he's the greatest.

866
00:50:57.880 --> 00:51:00.700
If it wasn't for him,
I wouldn't be working for the UFC this time around.

867
00:51:01.330 --> 00:51:04.390
None of us would be sitting here talking about the UFC if it wasn't for him.

868
00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.600
Well,
I had no intentions of going back and doing commentary.

869
00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:11.920
I was totally talked into it by him.
I was watching the fights like cage side,

870
00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.160
that's back when I'm Goldberg and I'm doing it with them.

871
00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:22.440
Jeff from hooking,
shoot,
Jeff Osborne,
um,

872
00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:27.160
and blatnick they were doing it.
That was a,
you know,

873
00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.420
2000.
One or two.
Yeah,
2000,
2001.
So I was just watching

874
00:51:31.710 --> 00:51:34.170
<v 3>Dana.
Got It.
The way we,
the way I got it,</v>

875
00:51:34.171 --> 00:51:38.040
the way you got it instantly and then was in,
and then you're in and you,

876
00:51:38.041 --> 00:51:40.050
you know,
and you're a Mormon.
You can't,
you know,

877
00:51:40.051 --> 00:51:42.600
you're going to have four wives or whatever the special underwear,

878
00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:47.760
whatever it is,
you are in a yeah.
In the UFC has that effect.
You know,
I,

879
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.450
you know,
I was in early,
no less today.

880
00:51:51.670 --> 00:51:54.700
<v 2>Are you shocked at all by the popularity of women's MMA?</v>

881
00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.020
<v 3>Shocked is not the right word.
Um,
uh,</v>

882
00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.540
it makes sense to me.
Um,
you know,
I wanted to try women,

883
00:52:04.541 --> 00:52:07.990
but we were in enough trouble with the cockfighting without making vagina

884
00:52:07.991 --> 00:52:10.840
fighting.
You know,
we weren't going to,
we couldn't do that.

885
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:15.130
A different kind of boxing,
but I think it took a Rhonda,
you know,

886
00:52:15.131 --> 00:52:16.780
and I'm a big fan of invicta too.

887
00:52:16.781 --> 00:52:20.350
I think Sharon APP is really good and I think the Invicta,
those are fun.

888
00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:23.740
Those are fun to watch.
And I think,
um,
you know,

889
00:52:23.741 --> 00:52:27.040
a couple of the women fighters from a few years ago just for a little bit too

890
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:28.630
much ahead of their time and,

891
00:52:29.050 --> 00:52:32.430
and now it seems like there's a critical mass plus this Rhonda,
you know,

892
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:36.790
who's the greatest,
I also like me should date very much.
Yeah.
It's fun to watch.

893
00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:42.010
You know,
so if it's fun to watch,
it's gonna work.
And I also think the,

894
00:52:42.011 --> 00:52:44.530
what Dana has figured out to do,

895
00:52:44.531 --> 00:52:49.150
whether it's instinct or you know,
whether it's strategy or both,

896
00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:54.340
he's like reinventing stuff every couple of years to just to change things up

897
00:52:54.341 --> 00:52:56.860
and make it fresh again.
And I think,
you know,

898
00:52:56.890 --> 00:52:59.110
the ultimate fighter is a good example of that.

899
00:52:59.111 --> 00:53:02.980
Then I think the Fox broadcast deal and putting it in that spotlight and I think

900
00:53:02.981 --> 00:53:06.370
Rhonda and I think it's like the sport is almost like,

901
00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:09.580
I don't want to say reinvented,
but reenergized every couple of years.

902
00:53:09.581 --> 00:53:11.140
And I think that's a very cool thing.

903
00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.540
<v 2>Yeah,
it's certainly a new element and it's new like seeing how many women are</v>

904
00:53:15.541 --> 00:53:18.720
becoming MMA fans,
not just because of watching the men fight,

905
00:53:18.721 --> 00:53:20.850
but also now watching women fight as well.

906
00:53:20.940 --> 00:53:25.660
<v 3>You know,
in my,
in your favorite show other than the UFC,
he called the marine,</v>

907
00:53:25.870 --> 00:53:30.000
uh,
which was a bet show.
I data was sort of the hip hop UFC,

908
00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.800
a huge female audience because we had great looking guys with their shirts off

909
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:39.900
and a lot of celebrities.
And it was a good formula.
And so women like that,
um,

910
00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:43.850
you know,
um,
I,
I'm doing this new thing combined to America.

911
00:53:43.851 --> 00:53:45.020
So if you don't mind me,
you know,

912
00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:49.860
plugging the show that's on Sunday on Munoz and what we're trying to do is reach

913
00:53:49.861 --> 00:53:53.700
out to an audience that maybe has heard of MMA but is not familiar.

914
00:53:53.701 --> 00:53:57.120
And I think that includes women too.
And it's all Spanish speaking.

915
00:53:57.210 --> 00:54:01.860
It's a bilingual network.
Mundos is bilingual.
So when hoists Gracie is on,

916
00:54:01.890 --> 00:54:05.220
you know,
he speaks in English.
When Eddie Alvarez is on,
he speaks in English.

917
00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.540
If you speak Spanish,
you speak Spanish.
And so we've created a,

918
00:54:09.541 --> 00:54:14.190
I've put together a thing,
uh,
called Gringo Wednesdays.
So Wednesday nights,

919
00:54:14.191 --> 00:54:14.701
10 o'clock,

920
00:54:14.701 --> 00:54:19.260
it's got English subtitles for those who Spanish is creaky me included.
Uh,

921
00:54:19.261 --> 00:54:22.230
so next Wednesday if you want to check it out,
that's the first episode.

922
00:54:22.231 --> 00:54:25.980
It's English subtitles and those that speak English,

923
00:54:25.981 --> 00:54:28.830
we'll be continuing to speak in English and Combat Day.

924
00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:31.850
American modern America's,
which means the fighting America.
So it's,

925
00:54:31.851 --> 00:54:36.060
so this is your,
uh,
your,
um,
your highlight for it right here.

926
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:42.850
<v 6>Two divisions that will test their hunger to become the next chip</v>

927
00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.350
they've even got what I got.

928
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.870
<v 3>That's cool.
So how long have you been doing this for?
Will be shot at,
uh,</v>

929
00:54:51.871 --> 00:54:56.520
in the fall in Miami,
uh,
button.
Marie productions,
very famous TV company,

930
00:54:56.521 --> 00:55:00.390
created the real world,
uh,
produced it for us.
Uh,

931
00:55:00.391 --> 00:55:03.390
it's got a bunch of Spanish a stars.
I even,

932
00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:08.160
I even tried to replicate a little bit of the Joe Rogan thing with a guy named

933
00:55:08.161 --> 00:55:09.660
Pauline who's sometimes,
no,

934
00:55:09.661 --> 00:55:13.170
not sometimes called the Howard stern of Spanish radio.
Uh,

935
00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:16.580
is he have a martial arts background.
He loved boxing.
You know,

936
00:55:16.581 --> 00:55:20.850
like an daddy Yankee who's in the show and someone I've gotten very close to

937
00:55:21.090 --> 00:55:24.060
like you,
you know,
he had a professional fight background.

938
00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:27.600
Daddy Yankee had five professional fights before he became a singer.

939
00:55:27.810 --> 00:55:29.550
And you know,
you know the difference there,

940
00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:33.270
like if you've actually had a fight for money,
you know,

941
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:34.500
it's a very different world.

942
00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:38.080
And I think Daddy Yankee came to this like a lot of Hispanic fans do.

943
00:55:38.081 --> 00:55:42.660
Knowing boxing and going,
you know,
the UFC is cool.
This is cool.

944
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:45.930
What's this about?
What's the,
you know,
what are they doing on the ground,

945
00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.690
you know,
what kind of gloves or those,
you know,

946
00:55:48.691 --> 00:55:52.290
like there's a lot of things that people we take for granted.
I mean,

947
00:55:52.291 --> 00:55:55.140
you grew up in this sport,
you invented this sport to Joe.
I mean,

948
00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:57.030
we've watched it develop,

949
00:55:57.480 --> 00:56:02.310
but you gotta think if somebody has heard of the UFC but has never seen it and

950
00:56:02.311 --> 00:56:06.750
they turn it on,
it's a very different thing.
You know,
you're on there,

951
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:10.200
it's intense.
They don't know what's happening on the ground.

952
00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:14.760
They don't know the players,
they don't know the rules.
You know,
and I,

953
00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:17.130
what I wanted to do is sort of reach out.
And then,
you know,

954
00:56:17.131 --> 00:56:21.780
when I went to tell Dana about this last,
um,
last August,
I said,
look,

955
00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.560
this isn't competitive with UFC.

956
00:56:23.561 --> 00:56:27.640
I'm going after an audience that I think doesn't know anything about MMA.

957
00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:31.390
You know,
I want to bring in this next generation of fans.
You know,

958
00:56:31.391 --> 00:56:34.840
I'm doing it the US Hispanic market,
you know,

959
00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:39.310
three times the size of Canada by the way.
And people talk about,
you know,

960
00:56:39.311 --> 00:56:42.340
we're all going to be speaking Spanish in 20 or 30 years.
Yeah,
whatever.

961
00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.540
But I know next year the majority of people in this country under 18 will be

962
00:56:46.541 --> 00:56:48.340
Hispanic.
So it's a youth culture.

963
00:56:48.490 --> 00:56:50.470
<v 2>The majority of people next year,</v>

964
00:56:50.471 --> 00:56:53.950
2015 Mexicans know how to fuck.

965
00:56:55.550 --> 00:56:59.690
Say how to put it down,
man.
Just the way.
That's the way you do it.
Don't say that.

966
00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.820
No,
they don't.
They do.
This is good.
They'll know how to fuck.

967
00:57:03.821 --> 00:57:06.820
Don't forget the Puerto Rican.
They know how to fuck to Dominicans.

968
00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:09.940
They know how to fuck as well.
Long Beach,
they can fuck their brains out.

969
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:13.780
It's a fascinating statistic though.
That's a,
that's quite amazing.

970
00:57:13.950 --> 00:57:17.320
We're in a youth business.
This is a,
this is a move to the youth culture.

971
00:57:17.321 --> 00:57:20.950
Los Angeles has 21 Mexican radio stations,

972
00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:25.800
21 Spanish speaking radio stations.
That's amazing.
21 stations,

973
00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:27.550
one city that don't even speak

974
00:57:27.850 --> 00:57:31.700
<v 3>and I think po leans the number one drive time.
I'm not sure.
Don't know Spanish.</v>

975
00:57:31.701 --> 00:57:34.970
Train his name on billboards and shit.
So he's your guy.
He's,

976
00:57:35.170 --> 00:57:38.320
he does kind of what you do,
you know,
he talks to the fighters,

977
00:57:38.321 --> 00:57:42.520
gets everybody pumped up.
Does he understand Jujitsu at all?
You know,
it was,

978
00:57:42.550 --> 00:57:45.640
he understands wrestling.
Again,
you know,

979
00:57:45.670 --> 00:57:49.270
the background here is very different if you're a Mexican,
Mexican American,

980
00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:53.470
you know,
Lucha Libra,
right?
And you know boxing and that's what you know,

981
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:57.010
but he's doing commentary,
right?
Yeah.
But remember this is,

982
00:57:57.070 --> 00:57:59.530
this is a reality show.
We're introducing the guys.

983
00:57:59.531 --> 00:58:01.810
We do fights on episode nine and 10.

984
00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.710
And what I've done is sort of tell the stories of the guys and sort of involve

985
00:58:05.711 --> 00:58:10.711
people in MMA and bring in hoists and bringing Eddie Alvarez and bring in people

986
00:58:10.781 --> 00:58:15.460
to show them.
My,
the guys I'm using actually are pretty interesting fighters.

987
00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:20.050
I've got a guy that's a sometimes called the Hispanic Kimbo slice level
Martinez.

988
00:58:20.550 --> 00:58:23.470
He's got a million views on his youtube channel.
Backyard fights.

989
00:58:23.471 --> 00:58:27.220
Very similar to Kimbo.
Uh,
so I've got an interesting group of guys,

990
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:30.610
but what I'm doing is I'm explaining it to the audience.

991
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:34.300
So we bring in experts to talk and been a voice comes in and he doesn't show

992
00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:38.830
them Jujitsu.
He talks about the philosophy and mentality of a fighter.
You know,

993
00:58:38.850 --> 00:58:42.730
and Eddie came in,
the guys were beat down from the competition reality show,

994
00:58:42.731 --> 00:58:46.180
and then they had fights in about a week.
And Eddie Alvarez was,
you know,

995
00:58:46.181 --> 00:58:47.530
he came in and he said,
you know,

996
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:51.430
at times you really tested and it isn't always tested in the cage.

997
00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:55.610
You're tested outside the cage and he knows what he's talking about.
So I,

998
00:58:55.611 --> 00:58:59.890
I want it to bring in guys that really meant something and introduce them to

999
00:58:59.891 --> 00:59:03.250
these fighters.
So these guys saw,
you know,
class acts,

1000
00:59:03.251 --> 00:59:08.251
world class fighters and mixed it in with a bunch of Spanish celebrities and uh,

1001
00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.730
you know,
and,
and Dre Kanye,
you know what she,

1002
00:59:12.731 --> 00:59:15.730
I think she's the most beautiful woman in the history of MMA.

1003
00:59:15.731 --> 00:59:18.820
And she's the Co host.
She was a journalist.
We found,

1004
00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:22.100
she does Spanish language commentary,
pictures.
Jamie pictures

1005
00:59:22.110 --> 00:59:26.270
<v 4>find Andres.
So does anybody see a l?
L E N?</v>

1006
00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:30.290
[inaudible] do they have commentary where the people were fighting?
Absolutely.

1007
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:34.850
And do the guys who are doing commentary understands Jujitsu.
Yes,
they do.
Yeah.

1008
00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:39.080
But no one has any experience in Jujitsu.
No.
Hmm.

1009
00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:44.120
So I'm hearkening back to my past.
Yeah,
we need you.
You need a guy to speak.

1010
00:59:44.121 --> 00:59:46.070
Speak Spanish.
No,
I don't.

1011
00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:49.260
Victora Davila who works for the UFC is,

1012
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:53.030
well God damn son Jesus Louisa's that's her.

1013
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:58.970
Oh my goodness.
That bodies ridiculous.
That should be illegal.
You know.

1014
00:59:59.030 --> 01:00:03.020
Holy Shit.
I'm telling you.
She knows more about MMA than I do.

1015
01:00:03.050 --> 01:00:04.250
Maybe not more than you,

1016
01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:08.120
but she knows cause I kept showing her to people.

1017
01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:12.530
Oh my Nigga got a picture of her ass.
Hold up.
Get.
That's my ass.
Get to that one.

1018
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.580
There's no way that's never asked

1019
01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:18.610
to Jesus and dre.
I know you're listening.

1020
01:00:18.611 --> 01:00:20.380
He's saying this with love and respect.

1021
01:00:20.410 --> 01:00:23.350
Matrass fellow fellow bronchus respect for genetics.

1022
01:00:23.351 --> 01:00:26.860
What's in your federal broadcast or if you've got a thong on your asses up in

1023
01:00:26.861 --> 01:00:28.630
the air and your song in the show,

1024
01:00:28.631 --> 01:00:32.470
I wear a thong and a Cape you do to keep yet try to conjure up that image.

1025
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:34.920
When do you wear a thong and a cane?
Why don't wear a thong and a,

1026
01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:38.830
what are you saying then?
Trying to discern information.
Yeah,
look at her ass.

1027
01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:40.480
That's the girl you work with.

1028
01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.370
<v 7>POW,
POW,
POW,
POW.</v>

1029
01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:46.800
<v 4>You don't think she knows what she's doing?
She wants you to say that.</v>

1030
01:00:46.801 --> 01:00:51.570
Campbell Mclaren.
That's why I apologize.
Um,
Joe Rogan,
Joe Silva,
Andrea Kayak.

1031
01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.780
So if no one understand,

1032
01:00:52.781 --> 01:00:57.000
if no one's my contributions can just get to do they know what the fuck's going

1033
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:59.090
on when guys are scrambling on the ground.

1034
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:03.540
Cause that to me was one of the most important aspects of,
you know,
you're,

1035
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:07.920
you're 100% right and,
but you're right.
For my next season or the third season,

1036
01:01:07.921 --> 01:01:11.490
what we're doing now is trying to give an overview of what's happening.
Remember,

1037
01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.500
you are so deep in this.
You can't imagine anyone not knowing.

1038
01:01:16.501 --> 01:01:19.620
Take yourself out of this mix and look at it someone,

1039
01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.260
they don't even know why they're on the ground.
And listen,
believe me,

1040
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:24.870
I completely understand people not knowing.

1041
01:01:24.871 --> 01:01:27.000
I have to explain sometimes to people what I do.

1042
01:01:27.001 --> 01:01:30.540
Like I've had conversations with people like on vacation or what have you that

1043
01:01:30.541 --> 01:01:34.710
have no idea who I am or what I do.
And you know that it'll come up.

1044
01:01:34.711 --> 01:01:36.570
Like someone will ask me a question and they'll go,

1045
01:01:36.571 --> 01:01:37.590
what's that guy talking about?
I'm like,

1046
01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:40.470
oh I do this thing and then I'll explain what it is.

1047
01:01:40.471 --> 01:01:44.400
And the look they give you when you cage fighting MMA,

1048
01:01:44.810 --> 01:01:47.870
you know what the cages in Spanish,
this is why I like,
you know,

1049
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:52.910
Hispanic culture has really drawn me in the cage in Spanish is lot how la Blah

1050
01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:56.880
Blah.
Just sounds bad man.
It just sounds pretty bad.
Ass House.

1051
01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.090
Cajun Spanish is j u l a Ooh

1052
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:08.640
cage starts with a j.
That's even better.
That's cool.
Um,

1053
01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.050
so how long have you been working on this format?
I thought of it.

1054
01:02:13.051 --> 01:02:13.471
You know what I,

1055
01:02:13.471 --> 01:02:17.400
you know when I was thinking about this is when I came to the UFC,

1056
01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:19.830
the Indianapolis show,
which is

1057
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:25.020
<v 3>four years ago.
You know,
cause I was at a,</v>

1058
01:02:25.170 --> 01:02:27.720
I don't know if you remember,
I was really,
my mom was very,

1059
01:02:27.721 --> 01:02:30.810
very ill and I'd gone out to Indianapolis to see her and I wasn't going to come

1060
01:02:30.811 --> 01:02:35.370
to the UFC and I called you last minute and you and Dana always gentleman,

1061
01:02:35.371 --> 01:02:35.821
very great.

1062
01:02:35.821 --> 01:02:39.990
You say come sit with me at the event I was really depressed and I went out and

1063
01:02:39.991 --> 01:02:43.980
Dana was great.
And um,
you know,

1064
01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:45.930
I forget if it was you or Dan.

1065
01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:50.110
Someone said let's go go to the round card girls trailer.
I think it was Dana.

1066
01:02:50.111 --> 01:02:52.110
He goes,
why don't you stop in and say hello?
And I'm,
you know,

1067
01:02:52.111 --> 01:02:56.820
I'm married 28 years,
you know,
I'm happily married.
But yeah I went to the Aramco

1068
01:02:57.020 --> 01:03:01.110
<v 2>trip cause cause I did just take a peek in there and just thought I'd</v>

1069
01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:05.610
<v 3>look and I thought,
you know,
these girls are so pretty and a really pretty girls,</v>

1070
01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:09.060
but they're so skinny.
You know.
And I was thinking about the different,

1071
01:03:09.061 --> 01:03:13.440
something would look how everything would look different if you were doing MMA

1072
01:03:13.441 --> 01:03:14.430
for Hispanic rd.

1073
01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.640
<v 2>That's fun.
And it was the girls,
pretty girls.
I mean,</v>

1074
01:03:17.641 --> 01:03:21.270
you know the UFC round car girls or you could take them home to your mom.

1075
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.700
They're beautiful.
They're wonderful.
They're skinny though.

1076
01:03:23.701 --> 01:03:25.380
Just skinny Asian girls.
A lot of them.

1077
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:29.790
So we were thinking they would look more like Andrea Kai.
Yay the problem.

1078
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:32.650
I ain't,
dre is so beautiful that around called girls kind of look.

1079
01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:37.460
They didn't match up to our host really well.
No,
they were okay.
They're,

1080
01:03:37.461 --> 01:03:38.250
they're okay too.
Yeah.

1081
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:42.060
And we're doing a big contest here in La to find the next season's round card

1082
01:03:42.061 --> 01:03:44.760
girls now that's going on all around us.
Yeah.

1083
01:03:44.761 --> 01:03:47.640
What is it about people that think that girls are supposed to be skinny?

1084
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:52.290
Like the will you ever understand that?
Well,
one who figured that out.

1085
01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.340
Like there's a lot of women that are actually trying to lose weight to get

1086
01:03:56.341 --> 01:03:59.430
skinnier.
It's not because they think that that's the ideal,

1087
01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:02.850
like to get like really thin,
like model type skinny.

1088
01:04:02.851 --> 01:04:06.810
They think somehow or another that that's attractive to men.
It's very bizarre.

1089
01:04:06.930 --> 01:04:11.670
Like this.
I guess some men must like it,
but most men that I know,

1090
01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.210
men or boys prefer that for that,

1091
01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:19.680
that big juicy as Kapow that God damn son,

1092
01:04:21.690 --> 01:04:24.960
I just a it seems unnatural.
The,

1093
01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:28.890
the real skinny skinny looks seems like it's weird that that's like a,

1094
01:04:28.891 --> 01:04:32.790
that's something that women shoot for.
And I think they do it for themselves.

1095
01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:35.440
Like the,
you know,
it's almost like for the,
the,

1096
01:04:35.460 --> 01:04:38.610
the approval of other women or the attractiveness of other women.

1097
01:04:38.611 --> 01:04:40.830
Like how like clothes and shoes.

1098
01:04:40.831 --> 01:04:45.450
Like I've heard women actually say that they dress that way for girls.
The girls,

1099
01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:47.380
depending on where you're going with this.
But I like it.
I'm ready.

1100
01:04:47.381 --> 01:04:49.080
You know what I'm saying?
I'm not saying Lesbian Shit.

1101
01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:52.380
I'm just saying this is something weird that they,
they're missing.

1102
01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.270
They're missing a lot by what men,

1103
01:04:54.271 --> 01:04:58.500
like what men like is that chick you got pow wow,
don't you think?

1104
01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:02.010
<v 3>Uh,
it's the women's point of view as men really don't notice that much unless</v>

1105
01:05:02.011 --> 01:05:03.990
you're there naked.
So it's like,

1106
01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:04.751
<v 2>well,</v>

1107
01:05:04.751 --> 01:05:08.800
we notice when like women to look nice and dress nice and the woman who feels

1108
01:05:08.801 --> 01:05:10.600
confident in their clothes and all that good stuff,

1109
01:05:10.601 --> 01:05:13.420
but with health health is good.
You know,

1110
01:05:13.830 --> 01:05:15.100
it looks like she works out and you know,

1111
01:05:15.130 --> 01:05:19.360
symmetry and health are actually hallmarks of beauty,
right?
It's when you,

1112
01:05:19.390 --> 01:05:22.030
when you change that around,
that's when you start to get some strange.

1113
01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.360
Rhonda is a very beautiful woman and she's a a bronie chick yas.

1114
01:05:27.730 --> 01:05:32.590
Yeah.
Which is not your ass kicked my ass.
Yeah.
She's a,
she's a tough girl,
man.

1115
01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:34.830
She's tough.
She loves fighting and she,

1116
01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:38.890
she's the perfect person to be the champion and the emergence of women's MMA in

1117
01:05:38.891 --> 01:05:39.970
the modern era.
I mean,

1118
01:05:39.971 --> 01:05:43.240
Gina Carano was an excellent spokesperson as well for sort of a lot of the same

1119
01:05:43.241 --> 01:05:43.960
reasons.

1120
01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:47.410
She's an ass kicker and she's also very beautiful and very talented and very

1121
01:05:47.411 --> 01:05:50.860
tough.
But Rhonda is just some next level shit.
You know,

1122
01:05:50.940 --> 01:05:55.750
her judo is the best representation of judo in MMA.
Without a doubt.

1123
01:05:55.970 --> 01:05:58.690
The,
the fight with Misha Tate was a perfect example of that.

1124
01:05:58.691 --> 01:06:03.550
Her throws are there.
It's ballet man.
It's fucking magnificent.
Magnificent.

1125
01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:08.080
Gets a good way to describe it.
She's got the best arm bar setups in MMA period.

1126
01:06:08.110 --> 01:06:11.590
If any way class men,
women,
doesn't matter.
She's the best.

1127
01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:15.370
She hits those armbars from everywhere and the way she does is just fucking

1128
01:06:15.371 --> 01:06:19.030
laser sharp.
Everything's her.
Her transitions are sharp.

1129
01:06:19.180 --> 01:06:21.400
She doesn't even hold onto the legs.
It's one of the things she,

1130
01:06:21.401 --> 01:06:23.290
she finishes armbars like almost,

1131
01:06:23.710 --> 01:06:27.160
she's got like some crazy percentage rate of finishing.
And you know,

1132
01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:31.780
some people say it's harder to do that to women because they're just naturally

1133
01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:36.710
more flexible than guys.
This,
there's more give in the woman's joints.
Uh,

1134
01:06:36.730 --> 01:06:39.640
I don't know about that.
I think that's ridiculous.
The arms aren't as strong.

1135
01:06:39.670 --> 01:06:43.000
That's silly.
Anybody their cores on a strong,
that doesn't make any sense at all.

1136
01:06:43.001 --> 01:06:47.260
You do yoga?
Yeah,
I do yoga.
And do you do as well as the girls?
No.

1137
01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:50.440
Um,
I did pretty good.
I'm actually pretty good.
You know what?
You're,
you're,

1138
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:54.010
you're,
you're,
you're a bad example.
Like when I go in to do the yoga,

1139
01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:58.270
they're laughing at me.
Why is that?
Because I can't bend over any direction.

1140
01:06:58.420 --> 01:07:03.320
Well that's you though.
You've got more representative in Mandan.

1141
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.800
You,
well not the American man renaissance.

1142
01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.630
You ready to get onboard of true now I might get arm barred.

1143
01:07:10.631 --> 01:07:12.630
I do the challenge.

1144
01:07:12.650 --> 01:07:17.390
The got to get our butter and regular basis looks more like me.
This is true.
Um,

1145
01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:20.950
women are pretty easy to arm bar.
I had a girl say that to me once.
Oh,
uh,

1146
01:07:21.190 --> 01:07:25.230
I can't be arm barred cause my uh,
arm goes to farm,
double jointed in like,

1147
01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.040
let me show Ya.
I garbaria bitch.
Just relax.
That's a lawsuit.

1148
01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:30.671
Well,

1149
01:07:30.671 --> 01:07:33.680
it's not hard to do because first of all there's a bunch of different armbars

1150
01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:35.350
inverted armbars.

1151
01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.590
It doesn't matter how far your arm goes back cause you have so much leverage to

1152
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:43.360
play with.
But the,
a just a standard arm bar,
you know,
it look,
Frank Mir broke,

1153
01:07:43.361 --> 01:07:47.320
um,
Tim Sylvia,
his arm and it wasn't even,
he was like far down on the,

1154
01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:50.830
on the the elbow.
He was actually break.
He broke the forearm.

1155
01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:55.240
And that's how crazy that technique was.
Leverage and strength combined.

1156
01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:59.050
You know,
someone's got a good arm bar.
Let me change the subject here.

1157
01:07:59.051 --> 01:08:01.930
Let me ask you something.
So you said you're pretty good at Jujitsu.

1158
01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:07.180
You better at comedy or Jujitsu comedy.
Interesting.

1159
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:11.050
I've been doing it longer and it's more,
I don't know,

1160
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:15.070
it's more a part of who you are,
you know,
I mean it's really,

1161
01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:20.030
comedy is a comedy is sort of like a living,

1162
01:08:20.031 --> 01:08:23.450
breathing thing that you kind of throw it and add to every day.

1163
01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.640
And Jujitsu is in a lot of ways as well.

1164
01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:30.260
But Jujitsu is uh,
something that your body,

1165
01:08:30.261 --> 01:08:33.530
if you do it on a regular basis,
you do it really like all the time,

1166
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:36.500
five days a week,
six days a week,
your body breaks down,

1167
01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:39.020
you're just going to get fucking injuries.
There's no way around it.

1168
01:08:39.021 --> 01:08:41.110
Everybody's got neck problems,
back problems.

1169
01:08:41.111 --> 01:08:44.870
And I think the difference is Jujitsu is classic.
2000 years ago,

1170
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:48.830
2000 years from now,
you can,
comedy is continually adaptive.

1171
01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.090
Comedies like a fight,
you're continually adapting,
right?
Comedy's changed though.

1172
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:53.953
You know,
I think you,

1173
01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:59.440
you and Comedians have about your age represent the group that changed over,

1174
01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.410
you know,
you know,
I was in the comedy business for a long time.

1175
01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:05.590
I didn't know that though.
You Know Jeff?
Yeah.

1176
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:09.770
I ran Caroline's ran catch a rising star managed joy bay harbor and you know,

1177
01:09:09.830 --> 01:09:13.280
manage Larry Day.
No Shit.
You know,
I mean I was deep in the comedy business.

1178
01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:15.500
That's how I knew about you.
Um,
you know,

1179
01:09:15.501 --> 01:09:19.340
and my first paper view was Andrew dice clay,
no shit.

1180
01:09:19.370 --> 01:09:21.940
Which he had a paper view yet to man.

1181
01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:26.510
I made a lot of money because she was banned everywhere.
It was perfect.
Yeah.

1182
01:09:26.570 --> 01:09:30.260
And it was really with Andrew that I figured out how to do the controversy in

1183
01:09:30.261 --> 01:09:33.680
lieu of a marketing budget.
Wow.
You know,
cause he was banned.

1184
01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:38.060
He was dropped by his manager,
his record label,
the movie company,
Hbo.

1185
01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.290
But yet he still had only sold out the super dome.
You know,

1186
01:09:42.291 --> 01:09:46.700
when he was performing.
I believe it.
I mean it was,
he had millions of fans.

1187
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.860
They couldn't see him anywhere.
He's perfect for paper view.

1188
01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:52.580
Does the podcast all the time.
It's to me of him being a friend.

1189
01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.540
I mean he catches a lot of shit and caught a lot of shit from people that are

1190
01:09:56.541 --> 01:10:00.350
like very PC.
He's a character.
I mean that's where the Andrew dice clay is.

1191
01:10:00.351 --> 01:10:04.010
But to me he's a,
he's an all time great.
I think there's a,
there's a,

1192
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:08.900
there's a handful of all time greats that I have like the 20 top comp comedians

1193
01:10:08.901 --> 01:10:13.340
ever.
I put Andrew dice clay in there because uh,
to me when I was a kid,

1194
01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.270
I remember when I was like 18 or 19 years old when I first found out about them.

1195
01:10:17.271 --> 01:10:22.070
I remember sitting in my car with my girlfriend laughing our ass off,

1196
01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:26.810
just crying,
laughing at dice clay about how funny it was.
And it was a cassette.

1197
01:10:27.230 --> 01:10:30.170
I was listening to a cassette in my car and that's,
you know,

1198
01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.440
that was like around the time I become a dice clay fan in the rhymes,

1199
01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:39.570
like the fact that people could sing along like they want it,
they,

1200
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.720
you knew it was coming and you still left.

1201
01:10:41.721 --> 01:10:44.330
That's the first time that's ever happened in comedy because that's sort of

1202
01:10:44.331 --> 01:10:45.530
violates what comedy is.

1203
01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:48.650
What comedy is supposed to be supposed to sneak attack on you.

1204
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.120
This is way too esoteric a conversation.
But do you remember Yakov Smirnoff?
Sure.

1205
01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.090
He reminded me a lot of dice because it was a very similar setup,

1206
01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:02.150
cartoony character,
but it was that there was one joke,
the government,

1207
01:11:02.151 --> 01:11:05.450
the Russian government is going to do something to you.
Right,
right,
right.

1208
01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:06.650
You know,
and,

1209
01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:11.630
and Andrew was much bigger because he hit something that registered,

1210
01:11:11.631 --> 01:11:13.980
like the UFC registered everyone.
Do you know,
I

1211
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:17.730
<v 4>promoted his paper view.
We went to a George Foreman,</v>

1212
01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:22.890
a press conference for his fight.
Dice walked in with a boxing robe,

1213
01:11:22.891 --> 01:11:27.300
one glove and a cigarette in the other hand.
Yeah,
dice come on a paper view.

1214
01:11:27.690 --> 01:11:28.560
And we,

1215
01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.280
we broke up foreman's press conference because we didn't have the budget to do

1216
01:11:32.281 --> 01:11:34.920
our own press conference and you know,
and I go,

1217
01:11:34.950 --> 01:11:39.030
I walked into that with Andrew and I go,
you know,
see they're going to work.
I'm,

1218
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:40.500
I,
I'm gonna take a beating.

1219
01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:44.400
I'm really am going to get beaten up and throw them through a door.

1220
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.610
And then George Foreman stood up and he lifted a dice.

1221
01:11:47.611 --> 01:11:52.410
Clay's one handed a one glove and lifted over his head and that was the picture

1222
01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:55.410
and that was it.
Man.
It was great.
Foreman was great.

1223
01:11:56.650 --> 01:12:01.050
That group surrounding George,
we're not so thrilled with my appearance.

1224
01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:04.830
Did they beat you up conference?
No,
we got,
you know,
we,
you know,

1225
01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:06.390
got out where the getting's good.
Yeah.
You know,

1226
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:09.780
discretion was the better part of valor.
You've been involved some shady deals,

1227
01:12:09.810 --> 01:12:14.730
man,
that was shady.
So I think it's called guerrilla marketing.
Yeah,
man.

1228
01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:15.840
Guerrilla marketing.

1229
01:12:15.841 --> 01:12:18.810
Back when there was no paper view back when there was no internet,
no Internet.

1230
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.590
You had to do things like that.
Right.
It had to be created social media,
you know,

1231
01:12:22.591 --> 01:12:25.380
to quote Betty White,
we didn't have Facebook,
we had phone book,

1232
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:30.930
we had to call people,
do stuff,
show up,
you know,
it was different.
Yeah,

1233
01:12:30.931 --> 01:12:32.490
it's a completely different time.

1234
01:12:32.491 --> 01:12:35.880
It's hard for people to really wrap their head around the idea of promoting

1235
01:12:35.881 --> 01:12:40.410
something without social marketing now.
But back then,
that was the reality.

1236
01:12:40.411 --> 01:12:43.770
I mean he like,
you know,
I've been in martial arts my whole life,
but like I said,

1237
01:12:43.771 --> 01:12:47.490
I didn't find out about the UFC until was like UFC two was on videotape.

1238
01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.860
I really didn't hear about it.
I didn't know.

1239
01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:53.700
How would you hear about exactly know,
but whereas if the New York Times wrote,

1240
01:12:53.790 --> 01:12:58.620
you know,
death is cheap,
1495 tented sort of,
is that what they wrote?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1241
01:12:58.621 --> 01:13:01.320
I didn't read that either.
I don't read the New York Times.
Um,

1242
01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:03.720
I used to deliver it,
deliver it at times.

1243
01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:07.900
I'm not sure who reads the New York Times except people in the media.
Well,

1244
01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.500
and they read that they went bad shit.

1245
01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:14.490
New Yorkers and pseudo intellectuals worldwide who like to pretend that makes

1246
01:13:14.491 --> 01:13:16.740
them extra smart if they read the New York Times.
Well,

1247
01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:20.760
let me give a shout out to Richard Sandomir who still covering sports poorly for

1248
01:13:20.761 --> 01:13:25.620
the New York Times.
So I got to say he is one of the unsung heroes of the UFC.

1249
01:13:25.621 --> 01:13:28.440
If it wasn't for Richard Sandomir,
I'm not sure any of us would be here.

1250
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:30.570
Why is that?
Because he wrote death is cheap.

1251
01:13:30.571 --> 01:13:33.810
1495 we would still be here fucked up outlet,

1252
01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:37.920
picked it up and wanted to interview me.
Jim Brown,
you know,
it went crazy.

1253
01:13:37.921 --> 01:13:41.790
It went crazy and I,
I'm not sure Richard was really trying to help.
I'm not sure.

1254
01:13:41.791 --> 01:13:45.960
I couldn't tell from,
maybe it was irony that he was using in the article,
but uh,

1255
01:13:46.290 --> 01:13:48.960
you know,
he asked me,
he goes,
you're promoting violence.
And I said,
you know,

1256
01:13:48.961 --> 01:13:53.040
there's gun violence,
which is an issue.
I said,
and this is the martial arts.

1257
01:13:53.370 --> 01:13:56.340
I said,
have you ever heard of a drive by kicking?

1258
01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:00.150
Which I thought was a reasonable thing to say.
And he said,

1259
01:14:00.540 --> 01:14:04.020
that shows what a sick sense of humor that guy has.
That's the kind of guy,

1260
01:14:04.050 --> 01:14:07.590
you know,
drive by kicking.
That's,
that's a sick sense of humor,

1261
01:14:07.980 --> 01:14:12.160
I guess to Richard's sand.
A mural of the New York Times.
Well,
people

1262
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.480
<v 2>like that get into positions like that and they make a mess of things.
He helped,</v>

1263
01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.950
well maybe whatever.
Fuck that guy.
Yeah,
exactly.

1264
01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.790
There's just so many of those people out there.

1265
01:14:22.791 --> 01:14:26.680
And some of those silly people that have these really shitty personalities and

1266
01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.380
poor points of view,
their points of view suck.

1267
01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:32.830
And when you're expressing your point of view and you have the outlet,

1268
01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:36.400
like the media outlet,
like a New York Times,
you have that ability,

1269
01:14:36.490 --> 01:14:37.720
you can get incredibly arrogant.

1270
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:39.820
You can get incredibly arrogant about your position,

1271
01:14:39.821 --> 01:14:41.320
your point of view and you know,

1272
01:14:41.321 --> 01:14:45.850
also incredibly arrogant about your ideas being more important than other

1273
01:14:45.851 --> 01:14:48.610
people's ideas.
You are a protector of the,

1274
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:52.890
the moral high ground is the big one.
We experienced that a lot on fear factors.

1275
01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:55.690
Well,
people taking the moral high ground factor.

1276
01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:59.860
I forgot to add that in to your list of renaissance man of tough guy stuff.

1277
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:03.850
You know,
where would Dave Chappelle be without fear factor?

1278
01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:07.810
Because that was clearly,
it was funny.
Please.
Clayton becomes the fucking blind.

1279
01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.300
A racist that didn't know that he was black.

1280
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:12.250
That's the greatest sketches of all time.

1281
01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:15.280
That's the greatest comedy sketch of all time.
Dave would have been fine,

1282
01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:19.270
but yes he would.
But he did do,
uh,
their,
their fear factor was,
yeah,

1283
01:15:19.271 --> 01:15:21.970
that was a fun one.
That was fun.
What do you remember?
I don't remember.

1284
01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:24.670
I think it was fair,
fair,
fair.
He was on fear factor.

1285
01:15:24.671 --> 01:15:28.960
He was at the Tyrone begums was on fear factor.
Yeah.

1286
01:15:28.961 --> 01:15:31.150
That was fucking fun,
man.
We had to do that.

1287
01:15:31.180 --> 01:15:35.050
We had to do so many takes because I kept cracking up because Davis tire on big,

1288
01:15:35.051 --> 01:15:38.110
I'm just like,
I've known Dave since he was a kid since he was a teenager.

1289
01:15:38.111 --> 01:15:41.740
So it was,
it was,
it was beautiful seeing his show take off and being,

1290
01:15:41.741 --> 01:15:44.680
and I was a fan of it and being so funny,
but he's just always that guy.

1291
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.360
When you're around him,
you're always laughing.

1292
01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:49.060
So what we're doing these things we had to do many,

1293
01:15:49.061 --> 01:15:51.160
many takes just cause people start cracking up.

1294
01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:55.810
The time I spent around you is divided into either laughing all the time or

1295
01:15:55.811 --> 01:15:57.640
you're on some ramps,
you're on some mission.

1296
01:15:57.670 --> 01:15:59.440
I like the look as the last time I was talking,

1297
01:15:59.441 --> 01:16:03.130
we started talking about punching in the UFC and I contend it did.

1298
01:16:03.131 --> 01:16:07.480
It could get better.
Yes it can.
And because you went from there,

1299
01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:12.040
well it can get better,
but there's a lot of issues,
you know,
um,
the gloves,

1300
01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:17.520
the boxing style that a lot of people are used to utilizing in actual boxing

1301
01:16:17.621 --> 01:16:18.454
match.

1302
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:22.120
A little bit of it is dependent upon being able to block with those big gloves.

1303
01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:25.150
You know,
when you take that out you have a completely different thing.

1304
01:16:25.151 --> 01:16:28.810
I have war war machine was on the podcast recently and he was talking about MMA

1305
01:16:28.811 --> 01:16:29.501
sparring.
He's like,

1306
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:32.530
I don't spar with big gloves anymore because it gives you a false sense of

1307
01:16:32.531 --> 01:16:35.380
security.
It gives you,
but isn't it the stick?
Don't you think a stance,

1308
01:16:35.410 --> 01:16:37.570
it's more of a factor.
Stance is definitely a factor.

1309
01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.370
You have to be more square in MMA to avoid the take downs.

1310
01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:43.980
And I'm seeing that with the Spanish guys that are all coming in from boxing.

1311
01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:47.320
Right.
And they're opening themselves up.
They're good.
Punchers though.

1312
01:16:47.321 --> 01:16:51.520
I mean Chris punchers and it's,
you know,

1313
01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:55.450
some of them would get eaten up in the UFC because they're leaving themselves so

1314
01:16:55.451 --> 01:16:56.030
wide open.

1315
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:59.140
I'm very interested to see how that shakes down because most of these guys are

1316
01:16:59.141 --> 01:17:03.730
coming in.
One Guy,
Joey's dad is a pro boxer.
So He's coming in from that.
Uh,

1317
01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:08.170
how many wrestlers do you have on the show?
One guy from Mexico,

1318
01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:13.250
one guy,
two guns from Mexico.
Those guys are gonna win.
What's the one?

1319
01:17:13.310 --> 01:17:15.300
Yeah,
those guys are going to want and follow the,

1320
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:17.570
put the money on the guys with the fucked up years.

1321
01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:20.140
Cause that was in the early days.
Ears.

1322
01:17:20.290 --> 01:17:23.590
Well the early days you're essentially going right back to UFC one.
Well you're,

1323
01:17:23.591 --> 01:17:27.170
you're kind of coming in at like UFC three or four.
It's more like five,
but yeah,

1324
01:17:27.171 --> 01:17:31.680
whatever point well taken.
Yeah.
These guys now they know something.
So yeah.

1325
01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.390
It's not like when we showed up and everybody goes in the pajamas,

1326
01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:40.130
pajamas,
I'm gonna kill him.
You know,
it was a,
it's no,
it's different.

1327
01:17:40.131 --> 01:17:41.360
They all know something's up.

1328
01:17:41.361 --> 01:17:44.480
But what do you do and how do you adapt to what you did before?

1329
01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:46.420
You do it all over again.
No worries.
You know,

1330
01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:49.880
you do it all over again and you let it adapt from there.
I think,
um,

1331
01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:53.030
it's something that every culture that gets exposed to MMA is going to have to

1332
01:17:53.031 --> 01:17:53.900
figure out for themselves.

1333
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.050
And that's one of the things that I've met when we were talking about the Wesley

1334
01:17:57.051 --> 01:17:59.270
snipes thing that I don't think anybody,

1335
01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:02.570
I think he probably did think he was going to kick my ass.
You know,

1336
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:04.310
I'm just like,
I thought I was going to kick his ass,

1337
01:18:04.550 --> 01:18:07.100
but if he had just rolled once,

1338
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:10.590
just gone into trained once with go and enroll with here,

1339
01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:13.850
here on are Henner you know,
anyone,
anyone who really knows what they're doing.

1340
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:14.900
Not saying that I'm those guys,

1341
01:18:14.901 --> 01:18:18.260
but role someone would feel how utterly helpless you are.

1342
01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:22.400
And then extract you get manhandled decent purple belt and watch how many times

1343
01:18:22.401 --> 01:18:25.040
you tap out in a minute,
you know,
just to purple belt.

1344
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:28.250
Just some guy who you know knows what to do and you're not gonna be stop it.

1345
01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.040
You know?
I think that these guys are going to have to learn that.

1346
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:32.630
They're going to have to learn how to stop the shot.

1347
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:35.180
Because if you get in there with a world class wrestler,

1348
01:18:35.190 --> 01:18:38.570
you're going down periods,
stop all this nonsense about,

1349
01:18:38.690 --> 01:18:40.620
I'm going to go to the side,
I'm going to,

1350
01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:44.060
I'm going to duck under his take down and say,
bitch,
you're going on your pack.

1351
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.640
You're going to be,

1352
01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:49.070
you're you to either figure out how to get back up or stop that from that dating

1353
01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:52.950
line by the church man.
I be on your back.
Yeah,
and then there's also an right,

1354
01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.960
it is that dominance thing really is to see fighters that didn't have a ground

1355
01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.540
game in the UFC be so man hang handled.

1356
01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:05.840
And it was like a prison scene from,
you know,
it was like a prison movie.

1357
01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:10.070
Even guys that got good,
like Pat Barry,
he recently quit.
He says,
I'm done.

1358
01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.900
Done with MMA.
I don't want to wrestle anymore.

1359
01:19:12.090 --> 01:19:14.810
He's going to go to a sign with glory.
He's going to do some kickboxing.

1360
01:19:14.811 --> 01:19:18.320
But he got to a point where he was on his way into the octagon.
It's like,
shit,

1361
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:21.980
I don't want to wrestle.
You think there's too much ground in the UFC?
No,
no,
no,

1362
01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:26.360
no,
no.
Not a fear.
Not a fear factor for you.
No,
it's,
this is the problem.

1363
01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.250
That's reality.

1364
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:31.970
But I've said this on the podcast many times before that I'm a fan of Ben

1365
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.600
[inaudible].
Ben Asked her,
it was a guy who fought for Bellator.
He's a great guy.

1366
01:19:36.050 --> 01:19:41.050
And like in like Eddie Alvarez challenge outside loudly and maintain his dignity

1367
01:19:41.210 --> 01:19:45.070
and his,
his gentlemanly take on things.
You know,
I really,

1368
01:19:45.071 --> 01:19:46.870
I admire that because he,

1369
01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:49.820
and they had the same problem with rubbing knee Rubik knew whatever.

1370
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:52.130
He's an excellent wrestler and um,

1371
01:19:52.190 --> 01:19:54.800
he gets criticized because he's able to take guys down,

1372
01:19:54.980 --> 01:19:57.950
manhandle them on the ground and punch him in the face and they can't do shit

1373
01:19:57.951 --> 01:20:01.730
about it.
And he takes guys like Douglas Lema,
like really high level guys,

1374
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:06.500
shuts their game down,
just shuts it down with his wrestling.
That's important.

1375
01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:10.530
It's that cause that's reality.
That is the reality of fighting with that guy.

1376
01:20:10.620 --> 01:20:13.860
Douglas Lema might be more exciting to watch on television because he's a

1377
01:20:13.861 --> 01:20:17.670
devastating striker and he's really scary knocks guys out cold and maybe Ben

1378
01:20:17.671 --> 01:20:21.390
doesn't do that,
but so fucking what?
When those two get together,
what happens?

1379
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:24.660
Ben Aspirin dominated Douglas Lema.
That's reality.

1380
01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.760
Whether or not it's fun and exciting to watch,

1381
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.950
you can't change that and you can't,

1382
01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:33.960
you can't like regulate your sport to make things that are less exciting when

1383
01:20:33.961 --> 01:20:38.490
you're dealing with a sport that involves fighting because you can't like get

1384
01:20:38.491 --> 01:20:41.100
weight of the things that are less exciting.
Of course you can.

1385
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:43.880
Why would you do that?
You have a real legitimate sport.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.

1386
01:20:43.890 --> 01:20:47.600
You have a sport.
There's a lot of entertainment in that sport.
There's a reality.

1387
01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:51.480
Hold on.
There's a reality and being able to shut a guy down,
okay.

1388
01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:53.880
And a guy like her and can shut a guy down,
take them down.

1389
01:20:53.970 --> 01:20:55.830
That guy does not want to get shut down.

1390
01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.140
That guy does not want to get taken down.
Now,

1391
01:20:58.141 --> 01:21:01.410
if aspirin can utilize his martial art,
which is wrestling,

1392
01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:02.790
legitimate martial art,

1393
01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.760
and take these guys down and completely dominate them for five rounds,

1394
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:09.840
tough shit.
You can't stop that.
Of course you can.
How?
Why,

1395
01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.740
how and why baseball pitchers are dominating,
lowered the mound.

1396
01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:17.130
Why did they do that?
Then they'll listen.
That doesn't make any sense.

1397
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:20.430
It's not the pictures of famous,
but it's baseball.
You're,

1398
01:21:20.431 --> 01:21:23.580
you're talking about fighting is fighting.
Okay.
You can change the rules.

1399
01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:26.190
You could hold on a second.
You can change your rules,
but the up,

1400
01:21:26.370 --> 01:21:27.870
the objective is still the same thing.

1401
01:21:28.020 --> 01:21:30.570
The objective is still the throw a ball that a guy can't hit,

1402
01:21:30.690 --> 01:21:33.330
hit a ball to the guys throwing at you.
Catch the ball when it goes in the air.

1403
01:21:33.331 --> 01:21:34.740
The objectives are exactly the same.

1404
01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:38.750
The objectives in MMA or exactly the same to stay up if you can or take a guy

1405
01:21:38.751 --> 01:21:43.320
down and submit them.
If you can't stay up,
you can't stay up.
That is reality.

1406
01:21:43.390 --> 01:21:45.900
There is no way you can change that.
If you change that,

1407
01:21:45.901 --> 01:21:48.870
you're cheapening what you're selling because what you're selling is a martial

1408
01:21:48.871 --> 01:21:51.360
art.
You're selling.
This is as real as it gets.

1409
01:21:51.420 --> 01:21:54.450
This is what happens when two people who are incredibly skilled actually fight

1410
01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:55.770
using the skills they have.

1411
01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:58.620
If you handicap the guy's skill just for entertainment,

1412
01:21:58.710 --> 01:22:02.820
you cheapen the whole product cheap and the whole sport arguing with you on
this.

1413
01:22:02.850 --> 01:22:06.600
We keep in the sport,
I let's,
I tried to do this.

1414
01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:09.790
This is what we started out trying to do to make it as real as possible.

1415
01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:12.090
Well let's,
let's quantify what we're saying.

1416
01:22:12.330 --> 01:22:14.700
Let's quantify what you mean as far as like,
yes,

1417
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:17.910
you can change it because if you're talking about like what are,

1418
01:22:17.911 --> 01:22:21.240
what are you talking about when you're saying you can change it to stop a guy

1419
01:22:21.241 --> 01:22:24.540
who some people perceive as being boring or make the fights more exciting?
Well,

1420
01:22:24.541 --> 01:22:27.450
for one thing,
you can not sign them to your franchise,
right?

1421
01:22:27.451 --> 01:22:29.950
I mean that's one thing you can do.
You can let them,
I,
I might,

1422
01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.890
I'm going to say go on record.
I think that's a mistake.

1423
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:34.230
I think the UFC should've signed them.
If I was running things,

1424
01:22:34.231 --> 01:22:38.580
I would assign them in a heartbeat.
You know,
I really like Ben,
so you know,
I,

1425
01:22:38.581 --> 01:22:42.030
I wish him,
you know,
I hope it all works out and I wish I'd talked to him.

1426
01:22:42.031 --> 01:22:45.270
So he didn't talk shit about the UFC because he said a bunch of Shit and talk

1427
01:22:45.271 --> 01:22:47.310
some shit about Dana,
which is unnecessary.

1428
01:22:47.311 --> 01:22:52.110
I W I wish maybe the heat of the moment,
I'm sure.
Well,
he's a fucking proud guy.

1429
01:22:52.111 --> 01:22:55.060
He's a proud,
you know,
champion athletes and accomplished athletes.

1430
01:22:56.190 --> 01:23:00.080
That's one of like,
I,
I'm bummed out about that.
But say,

1431
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:05.900
say I had a fight franchise and say it was called Combate and you can watch

1432
01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:10.480
<v 3>it this Sunday on Monday.
Right?
So like one of the things I did,
like I have this,</v>

1433
01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.290
the guys have a tradition of,
you know,
Mexican wrestling,
Lucha Libra,
right?

1434
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:19.291
So I brought in a guy called the blue demon to show them stagecraft because

1435
01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:23.560
there are some things you can add to the sport,
right?
How you enter,

1436
01:23:23.650 --> 01:23:26.080
how you leave,
what you do after you win.

1437
01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.560
I think that's a really big part of this.
I think this is an entertainment too.

1438
01:23:29.710 --> 01:23:33.850
You know,
boxing,
uh,
Joe Louis always made more money than Babe Ruth,
right?

1439
01:23:34.030 --> 01:23:36.820
Cause there's an entertainment factor to what fighters do.

1440
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:40.120
And you have to acknowledge that and the fighters have to work with that.

1441
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:44.910
And I think sometimes it's put upon them with John Jones,
you know,
great fighter,

1442
01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:49.000
tremendous athlete,
really good athlete.
But the fight was Gutsy,

1443
01:23:49.001 --> 01:23:52.120
is the one that I think it was thrust on him and he had to show heart and he had

1444
01:23:52.121 --> 01:23:55.390
to work it through and he had to do all this stuff.
So that was fate.

1445
01:23:55.540 --> 01:23:59.500
That was Karma that happened to him.
But if that hadn't happened,

1446
01:23:59.530 --> 01:24:03.130
you gotta do something with a guy like that because the fans weren't responding

1447
01:24:03.131 --> 01:24:03.670
to him.

1448
01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:04.870
<v 2>Wait a minute,
what are you talking about?</v>

1449
01:24:04.871 --> 01:24:07.900
You're saying the fans weren't responding to Jon Jones dominating people choking

1450
01:24:07.901 --> 01:24:12.540
out low.
The Leo Machida I choking out rampage Jackson.
I'm not saying

1451
01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:14.320
<v 3>people didn't think he was accomplished,</v>

1452
01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:18.760
but I didn't see this surge in popularity that he should have had from those

1453
01:24:18.761 --> 01:24:19.720
accomplishments.

1454
01:24:20.350 --> 01:24:24.420
<v 2>Wow.
I don't,
I don't agree at all.
I think he's incredibly popular.</v>

1455
01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:27.080
I don't know.
I'm confused about that.
I don't know why.

1456
01:24:27.090 --> 01:24:29.880
Why would you think that you think you think is styled boring?

1457
01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.850
Like John is boring styles that we're comparing him to brand.

1458
01:24:32.890 --> 01:24:37.170
I would say methodical.
I'd say brilliant.
I'd say brilliant.

1459
01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:39.240
The best ever at keeping distance,

1460
01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:43.320
utilizing his specifying which fight is the most fun to watch?

1461
01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:49.110
Uh,
well the,
the Augustus and was that fight was the most competitive.

1462
01:24:49.111 --> 01:24:50.940
So that's probably the best one to watch.

1463
01:24:50.941 --> 01:24:55.050
But the way I was dominated the Rashad Evans fight was a great fight as well.

1464
01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:58.920
Do you think Gustafson was his best opponent is most scaled opponents?

1465
01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:01.830
I think Gustafson is very well.

1466
01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:04.140
It's all in styles and how they match up.

1467
01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:07.470
Gustafson matches up with him incredibly well.
He's a very good boxer.

1468
01:25:07.980 --> 01:25:11.400
And John Gustafson is also the first guy that ever father was taller than him.

1469
01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:12.413
That's a big thing.

1470
01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.430
<v 3>You know what,
I think you really hit on it.</v>

1471
01:25:14.460 --> 01:25:18.660
I think when you were asking what you can do to sort of keep the sport true but

1472
01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:21.690
have more entertainment,
you have to think about those match up.

1473
01:25:21.710 --> 01:25:23.180
<v 2>This is what I think.
Yes,</v>

1474
01:25:23.210 --> 01:25:27.530
but it's also about a matter of you've got to look if a guy's boring or you

1475
01:25:27.531 --> 01:25:29.900
think a guy is boring.
I don't feel like Ben Aspirin's boring,

1476
01:25:29.901 --> 01:25:32.630
but if a guy like Ben asking comes along that people feel as boring,

1477
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:35.360
what do you want to see when you want to see him fight Johnny Hendricks.

1478
01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:38.360
That's what you want to see a guy who he's going to not really have a big

1479
01:25:38.361 --> 01:25:41.300
wrestling advantage with to see,
fuck yeah,
you kidding me?

1480
01:25:41.450 --> 01:25:45.800
I would pay mad money to see Ben aspirin fight Johnny Hendricks because Johnny

1481
01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:47.450
Hendricks knocks motherfuckers stiff.

1482
01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:50.600
I mean he's just a wrestler and he's a great rest.
Yeah,

1483
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:55.550
he's a world class wrestler.
He might be a level below aspirin wrestling wise.

1484
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:59.090
I believe he is,
I believe asked her just a little bit,

1485
01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.950
a little bit higher level wrestler,

1486
01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:03.830
but he's good enough that he can keep the standing.

1487
01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:07.610
I mean he might not have achieved the international a respect that astronaut has

1488
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:09.770
wrestling,
but it's close enough,

1489
01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.490
close enough where I think Johnny can keep the fight standing and Johnny

1490
01:26:13.490 --> 01:26:15.660
Hendricks can punch holes through fucking steal that.

1491
01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.620
That dude hits hard and that's the difference between the two of them.

1492
01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.710
His fights or like the Martin Kampmann one punch knockout,

1493
01:26:21.711 --> 01:26:25.580
the John Fitch one punch knockout guys who we've seen are really durable.

1494
01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:29.210
They get hit by Hendricks and they go to sleep.
I want to see that fight.

1495
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:32.780
I want to see if [inaudible] can do the same shit.
That would be awesome.

1496
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:36.350
You know the only way you find that out,
you know a lot more than me,

1497
01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:40.460
but the only way you can find that out is to get a guy like asking and let him

1498
01:26:40.461 --> 01:26:44.810
use his shit.
We've got to find out if he can stifle Johny Hendricks.

1499
01:26:44.810 --> 01:26:48.230
He takes Johny Hendricks down and gives him fucking nuggies for five rounds.

1500
01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:51.980
Holy Shit.
Like what the fuck?
How do you figure out a way to stop that guy?

1501
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:55.850
Because you're dealing with a guy like in Hendricks,
obviously he didn't do this,

1502
01:26:55.851 --> 01:26:56.750
but if he did do this,

1503
01:26:56.930 --> 01:27:00.260
you're dealing with the guy that when Hendrix who went five rounds with GSP and

1504
01:27:00.261 --> 01:27:01.580
most people thought he should have won,

1505
01:27:01.670 --> 01:27:06.380
and GSP is widely regarded as if not the best pound for pound fighter ever.

1506
01:27:06.710 --> 01:27:08.420
At least top three ever.

1507
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:12.290
So if Johnny Hendricks can get stifled by Ben asked him,

1508
01:27:12.291 --> 01:27:15.740
what the fuck does that say about Ben askers wrestling?
He got to find out,

1509
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:18.770
you got to fucking throw him in there.
If you don't throw them in there,

1510
01:27:18.771 --> 01:27:23.150
it's in a legitimate sport.
You've got to find out with every style.

1511
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:26.990
If you've got a guy who's a kickboxer just doesn't have any ground game at all,

1512
01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:31.310
but he knocks motherfuckers senseless.
Find out if that guy can stand up.
Well,

1513
01:27:31.311 --> 01:27:34.520
that's what pride did with Berko Cro.
Cop Mirko Cro,
cop first flood,

1514
01:27:34.521 --> 01:27:38.690
Vandelay Silva.
He didn't have a fucking stitch of ground game.
He had nothing.

1515
01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:39.711
They would go to the ground.

1516
01:27:39.711 --> 01:27:42.920
He would just hang on for dear life and they got a 32nd rule and after 30

1517
01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:43.521
seconds in the ground,

1518
01:27:43.521 --> 01:27:46.520
they would stand it back up again and they would start kickbox again trying to

1519
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:49.820
stay up.
They found out they threw him in there.
They find out.

1520
01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.050
That's part of the evolution of MMA and the evolution of MMA is still ongoing

1521
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:58.760
because if a guy like Ben asking can dominate a guy like Doug Douglas Lema who

1522
01:27:58.761 --> 01:28:03.200
just smashes people in Bella towards beautiful knockouts,
Stryker,

1523
01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:07.280
I want to see what that guy can do against the very best in the world.

1524
01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.260
How the fuck does he deal with Tyron Woodley?

1525
01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:11.810
How's he deal with that unbelievable athlete,

1526
01:28:11.811 --> 01:28:16.670
that ridiculous superhero body that Tyron Woodley's got and ridiculous one punch

1527
01:28:16.671 --> 01:28:19.100
knockout power along the stream on your show.
I'm just,

1528
01:28:19.110 --> 01:28:22.910
I'm sitting here listening and I go,
wait,
I'm on the show.
I should say something.

1529
01:28:23.330 --> 01:28:27.230
I disagree.
Disagree with what?
I don't know.
I just want to stir you up.

1530
01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:31.430
I just think that,
I just think that you know you can't,

1531
01:28:31.550 --> 01:28:34.520
you can't change the rules because you don't like the results.

1532
01:28:35.450 --> 01:28:37.070
The results are unusual.

1533
01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:41.810
That's the thing about a guy like asking [inaudible] around and it was,

1534
01:28:41.811 --> 01:28:46.250
you know it what it Silva say,
you know,
25 minutes of one guy on top of another.

1535
01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:48.410
Okay,
what sport?
It's not true.

1536
01:28:48.411 --> 01:28:51.680
It's not true because you're always going to have people that don't fight like

1537
01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:53.450
that.
You're always going to have the v Two r Belfort's.

1538
01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.070
You always going to have the Chris Weidman's.

1539
01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.920
You're always going to have guys who win and don't win that way,

1540
01:28:57.921 --> 01:29:02.320
but that way is a way and if you deny that ways away you,

1541
01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:06.780
you cheapen the whole sport because you,
you throw this element into,

1542
01:29:06.781 --> 01:29:08.430
into the mix.
It's very effective.

1543
01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.980
You don't like the way it looks so you pull it out,

1544
01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:14.640
but it's still very effective.
It's still an effective element of fighting.

1545
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:19.170
See,
you got to take the boring along with the good.

1546
01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.640
That's why I don't like stand ups.

1547
01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:24.660
If a guy can take you down a dry herb you for five rounds,
tough shit.

1548
01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:25.950
You got to figure out how to get up.

1549
01:29:26.070 --> 01:29:29.380
If that guy can hold you down and just punched you in the face or even just hold

1550
01:29:29.381 --> 01:29:32.040
you down,
you got to figure out a way to get up.

1551
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:36.600
If you can't get up a referee coming long standing you up,
it's a legitimate,

1552
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:39.650
I mean I'll say the referees are probably gonna stand a guy out.

1553
01:29:39.651 --> 01:29:40.950
Well I'll do that during commentary.

1554
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:44.010
I'll do that because that's just the way they do it and that's part of the rules

1555
01:29:44.011 --> 01:29:47.850
and I'm doing commentary on a real thing.
But if I had my choice,

1556
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.480
if they said to me,
what do you think?
Do you,
should we have stand ups?
Fuck no,

1557
01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:55.740
no standups,
no ever standups.
If a guide takes you down,
tough shit.

1558
01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.410
If he can hold you down for five minutes,
tough shit.

1559
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:02.040
If you can hold you down for five minutes of every round tough shit,

1560
01:30:02.160 --> 01:30:04.500
that means you got to figure out how to not get taken down.

1561
01:30:04.501 --> 01:30:06.900
And when you get taken down,
you got to figure out how to get better again up.

1562
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.590
You don't see that with some guys.
You don't see a,
a guy like Josie,

1563
01:30:10.591 --> 01:30:13.230
although getting taken down and held down because he can't do it.

1564
01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:16.170
You can't dig them down as you take them down,
you can't hold them down.

1565
01:30:16.230 --> 01:30:19.200
That's because he's the best.
And the guys who are the best,

1566
01:30:19.230 --> 01:30:22.200
you can't do that too.
And the guys who you can do that too.
Well,

1567
01:30:22.201 --> 01:30:25.680
they got to learn how to not get taken down and they got to learn how to not get

1568
01:30:25.681 --> 01:30:26.470
fucking mountain.

1569
01:30:26.470 --> 01:30:30.380
<v 4>So it's like you're saying,
it's like a handicap in golf handicap.</v>

1570
01:30:31.810 --> 01:30:36.760
<v 2>You can't take away a guy's ability because you don't like the result because</v>

1571
01:30:36.761 --> 01:30:38.320
the,
the abilities unusual.

1572
01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:42.970
And if you get it to a point where that guy is so good at that unusual ability

1573
01:30:42.971 --> 01:30:45.460
that he makes fights,
boring,
tough shit,

1574
01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:48.900
<v 4>hope and pray for a man to come along the can solve it.
You know,
you,</v>

1575
01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:53.380
we talk about this,
you talk about this,
Joe Silva talks about this sport,
um,

1576
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:57.280
as if it's a hundred years old,
you know,
it's,
it's not been around.

1577
01:30:57.281 --> 01:31:00.120
That was almost a hundred.
Now it's 20.
It's getting there,
getting there,

1578
01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:03.050
getting there.
[inaudible] I gotta say this,

1579
01:31:03.051 --> 01:31:06.730
some of the years the development was,
uh,
um,
uh,

1580
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:10.890
had been retarded a little bit,
a little bit,
you know,
99,
you know.

1581
01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:15.510
Well that's also my frustration when I,
when I quit.
Um,
it was,
uh,

1582
01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:18.820
when I quit the first version,
the UFC with a seg,

1583
01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:21.850
the UFC was in that weird state where it was a,

1584
01:31:21.851 --> 01:31:25.600
it was a paper view anymore or wasn't on cable,
was on direct.

1585
01:31:25.630 --> 01:31:28.300
There's on direct TV.
Only while I was on broadcast,

1586
01:31:28.301 --> 01:31:31.360
a lot of people don't know it was on Spanish,
uh,

1587
01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:36.420
broadcast channels because they were taking it an airing it while I was on FCC

1588
01:31:36.580 --> 01:31:40.330
broadcast.
Wow.
David Isaacs did that.
That's right.

1589
01:31:40.540 --> 01:31:42.960
I kind of remember that now.
I remember people were telling me,

1590
01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:47.560
cause you can see it now lay,
I think at midnight they were running it on,

1591
01:31:47.590 --> 01:31:51.100
I forget which.
I was probably the Univision channel here in La.

1592
01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.080
I think that,
uh,
did you do the tournament's?
I'm trying to remember.
No,
no,

1593
01:31:56.081 --> 01:31:59.980
I didn't do any of the tournament's Joan.
I was something,
man,

1594
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:02.750
<v 2>the tournaments were,
I mean that was just,
that was a different level.</v>

1595
01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.310
I was involved in maybe wait a minute and now that I think about it,

1596
01:32:06.311 --> 01:32:10.750
there was like maybe one or two while I was involved in the first one,

1597
01:32:10.990 --> 01:32:15.100
the,
the heavyweight tournament with v tour.
I was involved with,
uh,
the,

1598
01:32:15.130 --> 01:32:18.040
my first one UFC 12 tournaments.
Yeah.

1599
01:32:18.390 --> 01:32:22.140
Vito or beat Trey tell him and then he beats got frozen and won the tournament.

1600
01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:23.800
Yeah.
And uh,

1601
01:32:23.801 --> 01:32:27.310
that was also the first heavyweight champion because that's when Mark Colon be

1602
01:32:27.311 --> 01:32:31.570
Dan Severn for the UFC heavyweight title.
So I was involved in that tournament,

1603
01:32:31.571 --> 01:32:33.760
that heavyweight tournament.
And there was a couple afterwards,

1604
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:36.640
but then it broke down two weight classes.

1605
01:32:36.641 --> 01:32:38.980
Then guy stopped fighting more than once in a night,

1606
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:43.480
which I think is also very intelligent.
Oh.
It was a crazy thing to do.

1607
01:32:43.481 --> 01:32:46.540
And I look back on it and then,
and I'm amazed at happened.

1608
01:32:46.540 --> 01:32:49.960
I'm amazed those guys did it.
There were so many things wrong with it.
You know,

1609
01:32:49.961 --> 01:32:53.230
like when someone was hurt and we have to put an alternate in that hadn't

1610
01:32:53.240 --> 01:32:57.700
happened earlier.
Fight,
you know,
it was just undoable.
It's unfair.
Unfair.

1611
01:32:57.730 --> 01:33:00.800
Those alternatively incredibly unfair.
You couldn't make it fit.
There wasn't,

1612
01:33:01.190 --> 01:33:04.240
there was no way to make it fair where I used to laugh and say,
okay,

1613
01:33:04.241 --> 01:33:06.280
if the alternates going in and we'll take them in the parking lot,

1614
01:33:06.281 --> 01:33:08.660
we'll have someone beat him up for two or three minutes and then put them in.

1615
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:10.800
I mean,
there was no way to make it fair.

1616
01:33:11.140 --> 01:33:12.990
I don't think Gloria should do that either.

1617
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:15.680
Gloria's still does tournaments and I think it's a huge mistake.
Oh,

1618
01:33:15.681 --> 01:33:18.240
they're really good.
Robinson boxing too,
you know,
they,

1619
01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.190
but they don't fight twice in a day in pro boxing.
No one,

1620
01:33:21.191 --> 01:33:26.191
no one has two fights in the night and pro boxing in Atlantic city a few years

1621
01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:30.110
ago.
Really?
Yeah.
And um,
and I forget who proposed it.

1622
01:33:30.111 --> 01:33:33.870
Laurie right now in America represents the highest level kickboxing absolutely

1623
01:33:33.880 --> 01:33:37.990
in the world.
And uh,
the w the United States has in the United States at least,

1624
01:33:37.991 --> 01:33:39.400
that we have access to.

1625
01:33:39.550 --> 01:33:41.890
And if you have the highest level kickboxing in the world and you have a

1626
01:33:41.891 --> 01:33:45.490
tournament format,
imagine if that was the case with boxing.
Could you imagine?

1627
01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:46.330
I mean,

1628
01:33:46.330 --> 01:33:49.870
could you imagine Floyd Mayweather and Canelo Alvarez fighting someone else

1629
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:52.990
earlier in the day and then fighting each other?
Fuck that.
It's crazy.

1630
01:33:53.110 --> 01:33:55.090
That would never happen.
Crazy.
It's ridiculous.

1631
01:33:55.270 --> 01:33:58.330
And I think that's the thing you could chose to that tournament he was in,

1632
01:33:58.590 --> 01:34:02.530
what's the Bazooka Joe's Jovita Leni from uh Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1633
01:34:02.531 --> 01:34:05.410
Bazooka Joe and Ray Daniels.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That was great.

1634
01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:08.710
Josie Zuken Joe's in my show.
We brought him in to talk to the guy.

1635
01:34:08.740 --> 01:34:10.800
He's a bad motherfucker.
Bad motherfucker.

1636
01:34:10.820 --> 01:34:13.630
He really is that ass kickboxer that fight with him and Raymond Daniels was

1637
01:34:13.631 --> 01:34:15.670
amazing cause Daniels has all these wild,

1638
01:34:15.671 --> 01:34:19.030
crazy flashy kicks and bought the [inaudible] just kept kicking the legs,

1639
01:34:19.031 --> 01:34:21.910
kicking the legs and chopped them down and then head kicked him.

1640
01:34:21.911 --> 01:34:26.400
It was classic Dutch style kickboxing Dutch style kickbox.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1641
01:34:26.410 --> 01:34:28.000
That was a great,
great fight.

1642
01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.680
But then Balta Laney went on after that hard fight and lost.
Yeah,
finals.

1643
01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:36.940
Disappointing.
From my point of view,
but,
but because he had a hard fight,

1644
01:34:36.941 --> 01:34:39.760
I mean a too,
too hard fights in a day.
That's crazy.

1645
01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:41.940
And then a lot of time off in between the fight.

1646
01:34:42.540 --> 01:34:47.140
You know what I think it did back in the UFC is early days and it's very

1647
01:34:47.141 --> 01:34:50.950
different now.
But we didn't have a reality show,
we didn't have social media.

1648
01:34:50.951 --> 01:34:52.600
There was no way to get to know the fighters.

1649
01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.090
And if you saw a man fight a couple of fights in a night,

1650
01:34:55.091 --> 01:34:58.070
you really did feel like you knew him.
You saw him tested in

1651
01:34:58.070 --> 01:35:01.130
<v 4>a couple of different ways.
You saw his heart,
you saw his stamina,</v>

1652
01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:05.360
you saw his style because the style started to break down pretty much unless you

1653
01:35:05.361 --> 01:35:06.194
were at Gracie.

1654
01:35:06.410 --> 01:35:11.410
So I think it was a way to really tell a story about somebody in a one night and

1655
01:35:11.931 --> 01:35:15.590
by the end of the tournament you were,
you were rooting for one of the two guys.

1656
01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:20.180
That's a good point.
You know,
it's just,
I don't think it's a good idea as far as,

1657
01:35:20.210 --> 01:35:22.970
I'm not advocating the health and safety factor,

1658
01:35:22.971 --> 01:35:26.360
but I agree with you that there was a spectacle factor to it that was quite

1659
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:29.500
interesting.
It was really kind of exciting.
The fact that,
you know,

1660
01:35:29.501 --> 01:35:31.080
voice would beat this guy and then,
you know,

1661
01:35:31.081 --> 01:35:34.250
the hoist had faced that guy later and you know,
and if he beats him,

1662
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:37.160
he gets to the finals.
Like all those,
those tournament things were fun.

1663
01:35:37.310 --> 01:35:40.790
It was fun to track and follow.
We pulled the names out of a hat too.

1664
01:35:44.210 --> 01:35:45.650
That's crazy.
Yeah.

1665
01:35:46.170 --> 01:35:50.240
Well it's crazy now when you look back at it now and you know,

1666
01:35:50.241 --> 01:35:53.720
you go to these events,
like whether it's UFC 100 or one of the new ones,

1667
01:35:53.721 --> 01:35:56.720
like this weekend,
Ronda Rousey versus Sarah McMahon and,

1668
01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:01.280
and you're there in Vegas and there's 15,000 people screaming at the top of

1669
01:36:01.281 --> 01:36:04.400
their lungs and standing on their feet.
What does it feel like?
Do you feel,

1670
01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:08.750
do you have a sense of pride that you're a part of this?
Absolutely.
Absolutely.

1671
01:36:08.751 --> 01:36:11.930
And I'll tell you,
but,
and I don't mean that pride.

1672
01:36:11.931 --> 01:36:15.170
Not in the sense that I had anything to do with those live events because when I

1673
01:36:15.171 --> 01:36:18.800
was doing at our live events suck so bad.
It was unbelievable.
They were so bad.

1674
01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:22.880
And,
but prof course pride,
you know,
I mean Joe,

1675
01:36:22.881 --> 01:36:25.430
I know how much it's changed and I hear how much,
you know,

1676
01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:29.630
but it's still the octagon.
It's still you.
It's still Joe Silva,
you know,

1677
01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:31.490
out Connell still producing.
Right.

1678
01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:36.470
I mean it's kind of that creative thing that I put together.

1679
01:36:36.471 --> 01:36:39.810
So in feel,
it's like going to a high school reunion.
You know,
I,
I,

1680
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:42.860
that's what I felt like it 20th I recognized every,
you know,

1681
01:36:42.861 --> 01:36:44.930
I recognized everybody,
you know,

1682
01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:48.710
I used herb dean in the iron ring to sign herb and big John and you know,

1683
01:36:48.711 --> 01:36:53.480
and it's like that this is the group that I did.
It's very,
very different.

1684
01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.410
You know,
it's very different,
but it's also the same,
you know,
it's also the same.

1685
01:36:57.411 --> 01:37:01.460
So I have a great deal of pride,
not claiming credit for that.

1686
01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:05.310
But I do think,
you know,
I think maybe another,
you know,

1687
01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:10.040
bringing in silver,
bringing in you sorta like help create the DNA of the UFC.

1688
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.310
And another thing,
you know,
bringing in the wrestlers,
you know,

1689
01:37:13.311 --> 01:37:15.110
when it looked like voice was going to win everything.

1690
01:37:15.110 --> 01:37:18.920
And I reached out to Dan Severin and Mark Schultz who was the first Olympic gold

1691
01:37:18.921 --> 01:37:23.660
medalists to be in the UFC.
Severin you know,
these guys came in Coleman,
you know,

1692
01:37:23.661 --> 01:37:28.250
they came in to sort of challenge and I think that helps set up the DNA of,

1693
01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:33.000
of the UFC to the big college wrestlers.
Mark Schultz was a beast man.

1694
01:37:33.001 --> 01:37:36.860
A lot of people don't know and fight on,
what was it,

1695
01:37:36.861 --> 01:37:41.120
like eight days days or something.
And you know,
I called his brother Dave,

1696
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.380
you know who,
who was murdered by the dupont air,
if anyone remembers.
Yeah.

1697
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:48.650
Horrible,
horrible story.
I called him originally because I want,
he was bigger.

1698
01:37:48.651 --> 01:37:51.500
I wanted him to do it and he goes,
ah,
that sounds crazy.

1699
01:37:51.530 --> 01:37:56.430
You should call my brother.
He'll fight right in there.
Well,
he,

1700
01:37:56.431 --> 01:37:58.530
uh,
he wound up having to

1701
01:37:58.690 --> 01:38:03.690
<v 2>quit his MMA career because he was a wrestling coach and because of his,</v>

1702
01:38:03.821 --> 01:38:05.510
uh,
whereas at Byu is that,

1703
01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.580
I think that was that wherever he was a wrestling coach,
he,

1704
01:38:08.710 --> 01:38:11.770
they didn't want him doing anything with this cage fighting stuff.

1705
01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:16.660
So it was the opposite problem you had with news radio that yeah,
exactly.
Well,

1706
01:38:16.690 --> 01:38:20.140
it was one of those things where I think he was,
um,
you know,

1707
01:38:20.290 --> 01:38:23.170
he was in a position where it wasn't going to make any money,
you know,

1708
01:38:23.171 --> 01:38:24.750
and the way to make money as a wrestler,

1709
01:38:24.751 --> 01:38:27.490
as to get a coaching Gig and when you're an elite wrestler,
like he,

1710
01:38:27.700 --> 01:38:32.140
he had a real serious staph infection to where I almost lost his arm.
Really,

1711
01:38:32.141 --> 01:38:34.780
really bad staph infection where he is this huge,

1712
01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:36.220
I wonder if there's a picture of them.

1713
01:38:36.970 --> 01:38:41.460
There's a huge scar that he had on his arm that like

1714
01:38:41.740 --> 01:38:46.660
<v 4>all the way up in system,
the nerve Murcia Nerissa fleshing Murcia yeah.
Well,</v>

1715
01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.550
it's not flesh eating.
It's different than that.

1716
01:38:48.551 --> 01:38:52.530
It's just a very strong form of staph infection.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1717
01:38:53.410 --> 01:38:56.920
You know,
what impressed me about him?
He was fight ready.
He,
you know,

1718
01:38:57.190 --> 01:39:01.270
he was in fight level condition,
walking around.

1719
01:39:02.380 --> 01:39:04.420
You know,
he'd never was not like that.

1720
01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:08.950
That's why I could take that fight and be very secure and well,
a guy like that,

1721
01:39:08.951 --> 01:39:13.300
his wrestling is so God damn good.
You're just knocking.
Stop.
Sound is fat.

1722
01:39:13.301 --> 01:39:17.710
And he does.
I look,
is it distracting to look at yourself?

1723
01:39:17.711 --> 01:39:22.630
We'll shut the camera angle.
It's that angle.
Emphasizing my girth.
Listen,

1724
01:39:22.631 --> 01:39:26.230
my white layer.
You look beautiful.
You've been around.
Do you know Ariel Helwani?

1725
01:39:26.290 --> 01:39:30.460
Sure.
You see a nice guy.
Very nice guy.
He doesn't seem to know me.

1726
01:39:30.730 --> 01:39:31.720
What do you mean?
Well,

1727
01:39:31.721 --> 01:39:35.020
he confused me with Art Davey the last time I was on the show.

1728
01:39:35.050 --> 01:39:39.720
How rude and you know,
and I love art,
but I can tell us apart.
You look different.

1729
01:39:39.721 --> 01:39:44.340
Yeah.
We looked different.
You and are very different.
Yeah.

1730
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:48.880
I don't have a hat.
He uh,
he went anti UFC for awhile,
right?

1731
01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:54.190
Yeah.
Didn't he?
After he got fired,
he got angry and was saying a bunch of shit.

1732
01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:57.820
He wrote a letter,
he wrote an open letter to John Mccain saying,
you know,

1733
01:39:57.821 --> 01:40:01.870
you're kind of right.
Yeah.
It wasn't that.
And Art,
if you're listening,

1734
01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:05.200
that was wrong.
My man,
you should've called me.
Jasmine was,
yeah,

1735
01:40:05.201 --> 01:40:07.660
that was kind of a punk.
[inaudible] a good guy.
What happened?

1736
01:40:07.661 --> 01:40:11.040
He just didn't get along with you guys anymore.
Gone at that point.
Right?

1737
01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:15.280
When did you leave?
What event did you leave at?
Why?

1738
01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:20.830
I was consulting in Epping through like 20 2122.

1739
01:40:20.831 --> 01:40:24.510
But you know,
I think of the first 12 is mine.
Right.

1740
01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:27.640
And because of the concepts were mind,
you know,
we were doing themes,

1741
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:30.970
David versus Goliath and you know,
stuff like that.

1742
01:40:30.971 --> 01:40:35.860
So I think the first 12 you know,
Jesus had 12 disciples.
You know,
I had 12.
Uh,

1743
01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:40.720
but you know,
UFC is,
um,
wow.
I hope that's totally the same.
I mean,

1744
01:40:40.721 --> 01:40:45.580
that's hard.
That's hard.
Wow.
12 steps.
You know,

1745
01:40:45.581 --> 01:40:48.420
I'm just thinking of 1212 staff people.

1746
01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:54.060
I apologize and did not mean any comparison between me and you Christ.

1747
01:40:54.311 --> 01:40:58.120
I way didn't,
it was just jokes.
It was 12.
It was a dozen.
It was a dozen,

1748
01:40:58.121 --> 01:41:02.830
like a Baker's dozen.
So,
uh,
you know,
but I think I was trying to find,

1749
01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:07.570
um,
always something to promote,
you know,
back then again,

1750
01:41:07.571 --> 01:41:10.330
no social media,
no internet,
you know,
no budgets.

1751
01:41:10.331 --> 01:41:13.300
We always have to have some hook.
And it,
I,
to me,

1752
01:41:13.301 --> 01:41:18.280
it had to be fun or I didn't want to do it.
And,
uh,
uh,
you know,
on Joe Silva says,

1753
01:41:18.281 --> 01:41:19.690
famous,
you know,
this quote,
uh,

1754
01:41:19.691 --> 01:41:23.410
the worst thing that would happen to the UFC is if it became a sport that gets

1755
01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:27.220
attributed to me.
You know,
it's Joe Silva that's actually been saying,

1756
01:41:27.221 --> 01:41:30.070
I said that,
I don't actually remember seeing that.
You probably said that.

1757
01:41:30.071 --> 01:41:31.090
He just forgot you said.
Of course.

1758
01:41:31.091 --> 01:41:35.110
I said it just remembers John Perretti.

1759
01:41:35.111 --> 01:41:40.090
How'd you get involved with John Brewer like John?
Yeah,
I found him creepy.

1760
01:41:40.330 --> 01:41:44.430
Why was the creepy?
I just,
he creeped me out.
In what way?
In the creepy way.

1761
01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.390
[inaudible] John,
I'm sorry.
You're a great guy for your listening.
He listened.

1762
01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.760
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You're gonna find out.
He,
uh,

1763
01:41:52.780 --> 01:41:56.750
sent me a tweet once asked,
which is creepy why I never had him on a show.

1764
01:41:56.751 --> 01:42:00.790
Why won't have him on his show?
Cause he's creepy.
It was a weird tweet.
He goes,

1765
01:42:00.791 --> 01:42:04.810
uh,
you know,
uh,
I can't believe you won't have me on my show.
Uh,
I,
uh,

1766
01:42:04.811 --> 01:42:08.590
always respected you when we hired you.
And I go,
oh,
when he hired you,

1767
01:42:08.591 --> 01:42:12.940
he was nowhere.
We just said,
we may not,
here's why I think I don't like him.
Uh,

1768
01:42:12.941 --> 01:42:17.170
extremely challenging fighting or whatever the penthouse version was.

1769
01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:19.690
They totally fucked it up,
you know?

1770
01:42:19.691 --> 01:42:23.140
And that was Bob Gucci own and I think that same challenge.
Right.
What else?

1771
01:42:23.141 --> 01:42:27.040
Room fighting,
fighting Lee,
extreme challenge,

1772
01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:30.400
good fights,
whatever it was.
Yeah,
they did have a couple of,
you know,

1773
01:42:30.401 --> 01:42:33.010
and I had some good fighters and Peretti I think was doing the matchmaking,

1774
01:42:33.011 --> 01:42:38.011
but a Gucci only son and announced that he was going to do extremely extreme

1775
01:42:39.041 --> 01:42:43.420
fighting in Madison Square Garden.
And that's what made Giuliani crazy.

1776
01:42:43.500 --> 01:42:45.370
And that's what made everybody crazy in New York.

1777
01:42:45.371 --> 01:42:48.010
He announced he was coming to the garden,
you know,

1778
01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:52.530
we were going to go back upstate again to buffalo.
You remember?
You know,

1779
01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:56.620
but they announced they were doing the garden and Giuliani went on in my city.

1780
01:42:56.621 --> 01:43:00.550
I draw the line in the face of tyranny or you know,
I mean,

1781
01:43:00.551 --> 01:43:04.770
Giuliani fought the mafia.
He's like running down to try to hold up,
you know,

1782
01:43:04.780 --> 01:43:08.500
the world trade centers during nine 11 Giuliani.
He's not scared of anyone.

1783
01:43:08.650 --> 01:43:12.040
So when you piss him off,
you got to get off that bus man,

1784
01:43:12.041 --> 01:43:14.950
and you've got to go take another bus and you've got to get out of town and

1785
01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.510
extremely extreme fighting.
You know,
they were,
they,
they were rubbing,
you know,

1786
01:43:19.511 --> 01:43:22.480
look,
I went pretty far.
That was too far.
Don't piss off.

1787
01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:25.000
Rudy Giuliani did the mafia.

1788
01:43:25.001 --> 01:43:28.870
So how did Peretti wind up going from extreme fighting to the UFC?

1789
01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:33.220
What happened there?
It was someone's bright idea,
not mine.
So,

1790
01:43:33.221 --> 01:43:37.300
and then he came over and was doing commentary for the UFC or just matchmaking?

1791
01:43:37.301 --> 01:43:39.160
I think it was never match making commentary.

1792
01:43:39.170 --> 01:43:43.210
I think he was doing a little camera work.
I don't know.
I'm trying to remember.

1793
01:43:43.211 --> 01:43:46.000
I know he did commentary,
fixed her hair and makeup for some of the guys.

1794
01:43:47.530 --> 01:43:49.810
I know he did commentary for extreme fighting.
I want to say,

1795
01:43:49.830 --> 01:43:51.980
just want to say John,
there's no,
if you see me on the

1796
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.680
<v 2>street to beat the shit out of me and it wouldn't mean it wouldn't mean anything</v>

1797
01:43:54.681 --> 01:43:57.470
to you.
You could kick my ass.
Why are you worried that he would do that?

1798
01:43:57.471 --> 01:44:00.260
Is He that kind of outrageous stuff?
I don't really know him.

1799
01:44:00.320 --> 01:44:01.950
You're not really saying anything that outrageous.

1800
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:03.740
I'm trying to find out what you don't like.

1801
01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:08.900
We don't really established that I have a bad memory,
but I'm very creative.

1802
01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:09.951
You have a bad memory,

1803
01:44:09.951 --> 01:44:14.120
but you're adamant about fucking getting pissed off to do with extremely extreme

1804
01:44:14.121 --> 01:44:16.700
fighting.
Then you're really screwed it up for the UFC.

1805
01:44:16.701 --> 01:44:20.930
You really hurt the UFC so you shouldn't,
you know,
you know.
Well,

1806
01:44:20.931 --> 01:44:24.170
I don't think it was their life to Japan and do k three or whatever it was.

1807
01:44:24.171 --> 01:44:27.290
You wanted to do it.
If it was their idea,

1808
01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:30.860
they didn't want to get that press release.
They were not real.

1809
01:44:30.861 --> 01:44:34.520
They were oppressed.
20 talking about there's some good fights.

1810
01:44:34.700 --> 01:44:39.470
There was Mark Coleman or um,
uh,
Conan,
Sylvia.
When was I,
you know,
county,

1811
01:44:39.471 --> 01:44:39.801
you couldn't,

1812
01:44:39.801 --> 01:44:44.240
not Mari Smith at Maurice Smith kick was the first head kicks in MMA.

1813
01:44:44.330 --> 01:44:46.580
But you know,
Maurice Smith was one of those.
Yeah,

1814
01:44:46.590 --> 01:44:49.700
it was a little bit like the Dutch kickboxers fought everywhere and just kept

1815
01:44:49.701 --> 01:44:54.140
going.
Professional fighter.
Yeah.
It was always,
always gave a good show.

1816
01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:57.500
Never gave a great job.
Gracie Gracie fall with a wedding ring on,

1817
01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.160
punched the dude in the face with a wedding ring on.
You remember that?
Yes.

1818
01:45:02.210 --> 01:45:07.070
The bare knuckle days,
man,
that was,
uh,
that was a Mario Sperry.

1819
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.140
Mario very first fought MMA.

1820
01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:13.430
Igor is Novia Mario last eagle refers Enovia but its first loss.

1821
01:45:13.470 --> 01:45:16.040
She knew and she was lost.
You and Bruce back.

1822
01:45:16.110 --> 01:45:19.790
I just literally remember everything.
I remember a lot when it comes to MMA,

1823
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:22.700
I get,
it jogs my memory when you say it,

1824
01:45:23.050 --> 01:45:25.250
but if you'd asked me that before you said it,
I couldn't,

1825
01:45:25.310 --> 01:45:26.170
I couldn't come up with,
well,

1826
01:45:26.171 --> 01:45:28.970
I don't have any other sports in their clogging them up the pores.

1827
01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:35.360
I don't know.
Basketball,
baseball will soak up all your memory.
Yeah.
Stats.

1828
01:45:35.361 --> 01:45:36.650
Right.
That's all those stats.

1829
01:45:36.651 --> 01:45:40.310
They can just get chiseled in those spaces and nooks and crannies of your mind.

1830
01:45:40.730 --> 01:45:41.330
There's no work.

1831
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:46.250
There's no room in there for the eagles and Novia of crossing Gracie Jr,

1832
01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:50.840
you know all that shit.
Yeah,
man.
There was some,
despite her tattoos,

1833
01:45:50.841 --> 01:45:54.680
I remember the tattoos were bad.
Gary Myers,
Gary the iron bear Myers,

1834
01:45:54.690 --> 01:45:59.180
remember him?
Gary Myers,
holy crap.
Heavyweight and he was like five,

1835
01:45:59.181 --> 01:46:04.090
eight built like a fucking brick shithouse you notes,
man.

1836
01:46:04.130 --> 01:46:07.820
That's something.
It's like the guys,
the physiques now are very different.
Right?

1837
01:46:07.821 --> 01:46:10.050
It's much more,
um,
there's a,

1838
01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:13.400
there's a similarity to the guys and I don't mean that in any bad way,

1839
01:46:13.401 --> 01:46:17.390
but it's a,
you know,
it's like you see the specialized form in the NFL,

1840
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:21.260
the different positions have different forums and the UFC has sort of taken that

1841
01:46:21.261 --> 01:46:25.490
on,
you know,
in some ways.
Yeah,
there's Gary Myers in some ways it has,

1842
01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:29.840
but in other ways,
I mean one of the guys I brought up earlier,
a Tyron Woodley,

1843
01:46:29.870 --> 01:46:32.120
Tyron Woodley's built like a fucking superhero.

1844
01:46:32.121 --> 01:46:35.300
He doesn't look like an MMA fighter and a lot of ways he's so big and muscular,

1845
01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:39.560
he kind of looks like almost like too big for Mna yet he's fighting at the

1846
01:46:39.561 --> 01:46:43.310
highest level and he fighting Carlos Condit next in Dallas.

1847
01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:47.990
And a great fight into really interesting because content is built like more of

1848
01:46:47.991 --> 01:46:50.520
your standard MMA fighters,
lean tall,

1849
01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.090
<v 1>long guy with you know,
good musculature but nothing crazy.</v>

1850
01:46:54.390 --> 01:46:58.770
Whereas Woodley's just as fucking beast and Carlos condit has shown that he can

1851
01:46:58.771 --> 01:46:59.670
go five rounds,

1852
01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:03.750
go five rounds against GSP and still have endurance in the fifth and final
round.

1853
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:06.030
So it's going to be interesting to see,
look at Tyron Woodley,

1854
01:47:06.690 --> 01:47:11.370
look at the building or not Christ,
that's a fucking athlete right there.

1855
01:47:11.371 --> 01:47:15.060
That guy's unbelievable.
Like the fast and powerful.
Well,

1856
01:47:15.090 --> 01:47:18.120
he's still a little bit thicker than your average boxer,
but yeah,

1857
01:47:18.121 --> 01:47:20.730
I could see some boxers being built like that.

1858
01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.580
Just it's not unusual for everything.

1859
01:47:22.770 --> 01:47:26.190
<v 3>There's that better cardio than the Yam.
No,
they make no chance.
No Way.
Close.</v>

1860
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:28.590
Not even close.
I think MMA is superior.

1861
01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:30.590
<v 1>Fuck yeah.
I'm by 1000%</v>

1862
01:47:32.090 --> 01:47:36.530
say that they are above a boxer.
Yes.
They all limbic.
Rest.
You have to do more.

1863
01:47:36.531 --> 01:47:37.311
It's harder.

1864
01:47:37.311 --> 01:47:41.150
It's harder to control a guy's body than it is to move your own body in and out

1865
01:47:41.151 --> 01:47:41.960
and around a guy.

1866
01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.660
When you're controlling the other guy's body and grappling and pushing and

1867
01:47:44.661 --> 01:47:46.460
tussling with them,
they break it up quickly.

1868
01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.020
And that's the reason why Muhammad Ali,

1869
01:47:48.021 --> 01:47:51.110
who was so intelligent used to lean on guys when he got him in the clip.

1870
01:47:51.111 --> 01:47:54.170
But DOPA.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But when no,
he,
when he got him in the clinch,

1871
01:47:54.171 --> 01:47:56.480
he would lean on guys backs and their next,

1872
01:47:56.481 --> 01:47:58.880
he would pull them down and lean on him.
A lot of fighters do that.

1873
01:47:58.881 --> 01:48:03.200
Bernard Hopkins famous for that.
He leans on those guys.
That shit wears you out.

1874
01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.970
It wears you out,
it slows you down.

1875
01:48:05.120 --> 01:48:08.000
It's the same reason why George Saint Pierre did that to Bj Penn when they first

1876
01:48:08.001 --> 01:48:12.380
fought the first fight or the first round of their second fight grabs a hold of

1877
01:48:12.381 --> 01:48:15.050
Bj pushes up against the cage.
It turns into a wrestling match.

1878
01:48:15.230 --> 01:48:18.200
The more you can keep BJ wrestling,
the more he's going to exhaust him.

1879
01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:21.620
But if you're just standing around with them kickbox with a moving in and out,

1880
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:24.980
it's way easier to kickbox.
It's way easier to box.

1881
01:48:24.981 --> 01:48:26.420
You're only controlling your own body.

1882
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:29.000
You're moving your own body back and forth and around.

1883
01:48:29.180 --> 01:48:32.330
But as soon as you got to move and guy's body and he tries to move you when

1884
01:48:32.331 --> 01:48:35.360
you're trying to counter him moving you,
that Shit's exhausting.

1885
01:48:35.410 --> 01:48:40.090
<v 3>You didn't you as usual,
you're right.
But I think in any fight,</v>

1886
01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:43.030
the change,

1887
01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:46.750
the adrenaline has changed in your body takes its toll.

1888
01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:51.490
The focus.
Anytime you're in a fight,
I believe humans,
you know,
fight or flight,

1889
01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:54.790
we are made to run away or made to fight.
And I think when you're in a fight,

1890
01:48:54.791 --> 01:48:59.580
professional amateur bar when you're in the focus is,

1891
01:48:59.581 --> 01:49:01.270
is what becomes really challenging.

1892
01:49:01.271 --> 01:49:05.800
The ability to stay that focus to protect yourself or to attack.

1893
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:09.010
And I think that's also what wears people down.
You know?

1894
01:49:09.011 --> 01:49:13.870
And I think that in boxing you're,
you're exactly right.
MMA,

1895
01:49:13.900 --> 01:49:16.300
there's so many variables,
so much happening,
you know,

1896
01:49:16.301 --> 01:49:19.870
you're going to wear yourself out.
But that focus and boxing I think is very,

1897
01:49:19.871 --> 01:49:22.170
very wearing for those guys.
Oh for sure.

1898
01:49:22.171 --> 01:49:26.590
To be a target for that long is wearing certainly

1899
01:49:27.110 --> 01:49:30.710
<v 1>it certainly wearing,
that's the,
but that exist in MMA as well.
Um,</v>

1900
01:49:30.740 --> 01:49:33.230
the other thing is the five rounds or five minute rounds,

1901
01:49:33.290 --> 01:49:34.700
five minute rounds is a big difference.

1902
01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.960
To do three minutes boxing as opposed to do five minutes of grappling is a big

1903
01:49:38.961 --> 01:49:39.830
fucking difference.

1904
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:43.100
I think the amount that they have to train is different as well.
Like boxers,

1905
01:49:43.101 --> 01:49:46.520
oftentimes we'll just trained once a day and maybe they'll run in the morning or

1906
01:49:46.521 --> 01:49:48.730
get a little bit a strength and conditioning workout in the morning

1907
01:49:48.730 --> 01:49:51.220
<v 2>and then they'd do their boxing at night.
With MMA fighters,</v>

1908
01:49:51.221 --> 01:49:55.570
it's often to really hard workouts a day or three sometimes.

1909
01:49:55.870 --> 01:49:59.650
And when you're talking about three means that that's just unbelievably taxing

1910
01:49:59.651 --> 01:50:00.850
on the body.
Unbelievable.

1911
01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:04.270
It's one of the reasons why there's so much of a performance enhancing drug

1912
01:50:04.271 --> 01:50:07.360
problem and m m m m m a and hear more about it,

1913
01:50:07.570 --> 01:50:10.470
but you hear more about it.
Then you get hear about an Inbox,

1914
01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:15.470
<v 3>first sport to test for HIV borne disease disease.</v>

1915
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:16.723
We were the first,

1916
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:20.030
<v 2>you don't want a guy mounting you with the aids.
Not In the cock fighting.
No.</v>

1917
01:50:20.150 --> 01:50:23.360
Yeah.
You don't want that.
That's smart.
What,
what year was it?
Is that,

1918
01:50:23.361 --> 01:50:25.640
what did you guys do?
This was nicely scam.
Yes,
we did.

1919
01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:32.960
I love the admitted.
That's huge.
Yeah.
That's,
um,

1920
01:50:33.020 --> 01:50:34.310
that's probably a good thing to test for.

1921
01:50:34.400 --> 01:50:35.630
<v 3>You know,
it's funny,
in my,
my,</v>

1922
01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.040
my son works for the Manhattan da and they do this big charity boxing thing.

1923
01:50:40.041 --> 01:50:43.760
So my son was a baseball player and a high school and a little bit in college

1924
01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.330
and he's got gotten into boxing for this charity thing they're doing.
And he's,

1925
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:50.450
he's a good athlete and in pretty good shape,
play soccer,
you know,

1926
01:50:50.451 --> 01:50:53.510
plays a lot of sports,
whipped from the boxing,

1927
01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.280
whipped from the boxing workouts he's doing.
You know,
it's really,
um,
you know,

1928
01:50:58.281 --> 01:51:01.590
fighting is a very different thing.
We talk about this,
you know,
Joe,

1929
01:51:01.591 --> 01:51:03.830
I've got to say,
we all,
we want to talk about this.

1930
01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:07.520
Like it's a sport because I think it brings a certain dignity to the athletes.

1931
01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.090
It brings a certain sanctity of the events and it brings a certain advertiser

1932
01:51:11.091 --> 01:51:14.780
into the process.
So it's important to talk about this as a sport,
but you know,

1933
01:51:14.781 --> 01:51:18.200
it is a fight.
These are fights and that's why it's different,
you know?

1934
01:51:18.201 --> 01:51:22.310
And that's when you talked about that,
uh,
electric atmosphere.
It's a fight,

1935
01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:27.020
you know?
And that holy shit moment that Lorenzo described it is a fight.

1936
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:31.650
And I think what we're doing here in,
in promoting this is,
you know,

1937
01:51:31.670 --> 01:51:33.890
I've got to say,
I may take crap for this.

1938
01:51:34.190 --> 01:51:39.190
I think it's a good thing because I think people need this sort of escape

1939
01:51:40.190 --> 01:51:44.510
mechanism,
you know?
And I do think martial artists and even,
you know,

1940
01:51:44.511 --> 01:51:48.280
most boxers,
even though boxing has become such a ghetto,

1941
01:51:48.281 --> 01:51:50.150
I sport in some ways,
you know,

1942
01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:54.710
but I think the way these fighters conduct themselves and what they have to go

1943
01:51:54.711 --> 01:51:58.350
through and what they face and going into,
whether it's the octagon or a loud,

1944
01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:00.350
you know,
I,
there's,

1945
01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:04.300
there's an inherent dignity in this because it's a fight,

1946
01:52:04.350 --> 01:52:07.970
not in spite of it being a fight.
You know,

1947
01:52:08.210 --> 01:52:10.400
this is a real challenge.
You know,

1948
01:52:10.401 --> 01:52:12.470
I remember Ken shamrock had fought all over the world,

1949
01:52:12.471 --> 01:52:16.100
one of the real professional fighters in the early days,
right?
He,
you know,

1950
01:52:16.101 --> 01:52:18.800
he'd fought in Japan.
He fought all over the world.
He said,

1951
01:52:18.801 --> 01:52:23.660
when he went into the octagon,
in that steel door,
went behind him.

1952
01:52:24.170 --> 01:52:26.570
He said that was an oh shit moment for him,
you know,

1953
01:52:26.571 --> 01:52:29.770
and that guy had been around,
you know,
and I think I,

1954
01:52:30.150 --> 01:52:33.920
I agree with this being categorized as a sport,

1955
01:52:34.610 --> 01:52:37.910
but in some ways it transcend sport too.
You know,

1956
01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.750
because I don't know.
Football's a tough sport,
but I,

1957
01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:44.210
I don't think it's the same as going into the octagon.

1958
01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:46.040
<v 2>Yeah,
it's a different thing</v>

1959
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:50.720
<v 3>if you lose,
you know,
if the ball gets past you,
it's not that big a deal.</v>

1960
01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:53.780
Well,
it's not,
you just,
you might lose,
you might feel bad,

1961
01:52:53.781 --> 01:52:54.830
but you're not gonna feel bad.

1962
01:52:54.831 --> 01:52:57.770
Like a guy beats your ass for God gets on top of your,

1963
01:52:57.771 --> 01:53:01.880
mounts you and punches your face until you lean over and tap the mat or go

1964
01:53:01.881 --> 01:53:05.930
unconscious or the referee rescues you.
That's humiliating that you eat,

1965
01:53:05.950 --> 01:53:08.770
that guys stole something from you.
There's mean,

1966
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:11.330
so many people have said it in so many flamboyant ways,

1967
01:53:11.331 --> 01:53:14.090
but essentially he takes a piece of your manhood.
It tastes,

1968
01:53:14.091 --> 01:53:17.510
it takes a piece of what it is to be a man.
And people don't want to admit that.

1969
01:53:17.511 --> 01:53:21.770
But the reality is you become less attractive to women.
You know,
you,
you do.

1970
01:53:21.771 --> 01:53:25.430
If a guy kicks your ass,
you become,
instead of people admiring you,

1971
01:53:25.431 --> 01:53:29.090
they feel pity for you.
It's a completely different result than if you win.

1972
01:53:29.210 --> 01:53:33.710
Try takes,
takes away elemental and you work six weeks for that man.

1973
01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:37.100
You work six weeks and you still got fucked up.
You did your best,

1974
01:53:37.250 --> 01:53:40.010
you did all your training,
you put in all your time,
you drank water.

1975
01:53:40.011 --> 01:53:42.170
He didn't have any beer.
He didn't fuck.

1976
01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:45.080
He did all these things that you're supposed to do and you still got fucked up.

1977
01:53:45.230 --> 01:53:48.440
Rhonda,
you know,
says the opposite about fucking,
well,

1978
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:53.020
she doesn't have a Dick Hollow.
Yeah.
Is a big weekend.
You know that.

1979
01:53:53.410 --> 01:53:57.160
Yeah.
When you shoot in loans,
you're uh,
you're getting rid of things.

1980
01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.540
You have to rebuild.
You know,
I'm glad you explained that to me.

1981
01:53:59.541 --> 01:54:01.100
I hadn't really felt you didn't know that

1982
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:06.650
back to the cock fighting.
It all comes back to the cocktail.
Well,

1983
01:54:06.651 --> 01:54:09.890
this weekend is the first time ever in the history of the UFC.

1984
01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.310
Two Olympic medalists are going at it and they just so happen to be women.

1985
01:54:13.490 --> 01:54:17.540
That's incredible.
It's beyond incredible.
That's amazing.
And it's,

1986
01:54:17.541 --> 01:54:22.541
it's perfect that it's Rhonda and Sara McMann because they're two very different

1987
01:54:23.151 --> 01:54:25.530
worlds.
Deserve it.
Yes.
Do you know what?

1988
01:54:25.531 --> 01:54:28.070
I think that's another thing the UFC does,
you know,

1989
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.820
it gives a professional level two Olympic in college wrestling that didn't exist

1990
01:54:37.581 --> 01:54:42.410
unless you want it to go have Vince Mcmahon's,
you know?
Yeah.
You know,

1991
01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:47.330
dramas.
Yeah.
I,
it turned,
it turned wrestling into a professional sport.

1992
01:54:47.930 --> 01:54:50.990
Again,
wrestling used to be a professional sport.
You know,
long time ago.

1993
01:54:50.991 --> 01:54:55.580
It's very different.
Uh,
you know,
now it's theater,
but you know,
back in the day,

1994
01:54:55.581 --> 01:55:00.020
actually guys,
you know,
we're real wrestlers and wrestled is going back 30,
40,

1995
01:55:00.021 --> 01:55:00.980
50 years.
Right.

1996
01:55:01.370 --> 01:55:06.370
So I think what the UFC did is give a group of athletes or a career trajectory,

1997
01:55:07.550 --> 01:55:11.090
you know,
where it was an Olympic judo guy going to go.
Right.
I'll teach.

1998
01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.110
That's it.
Same with the wrestlers.
Yeah.

1999
01:55:13.550 --> 01:55:17.090
It's really shocking to me that there's professional avenues for things like

2000
01:55:17.091 --> 01:55:20.000
tennis,
but there's no professional avenues for wrestling.

2001
01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.090
I find wrestling to be very exciting there is in the UFC,
that's the bad,

2002
01:55:24.150 --> 01:55:26.930
but it's not because then they have to punch and they have to kick and they have

2003
01:55:26.931 --> 01:55:29.510
to,
you know,
they have to worry about head trauma.
There's,

2004
01:55:29.570 --> 01:55:31.970
there's a lot of new skills that they have to learn.

2005
01:55:31.980 --> 01:55:34.040
They have to learn submissions.
It's kind of amazing.

2006
01:55:34.041 --> 01:55:37.610
They're wrestling didn't become a professional sport and it's really one of

2007
01:55:37.611 --> 01:55:38.990
those factors of promotion.

2008
01:55:39.170 --> 01:55:42.620
It was never promoted correctly that real wrestling never,

2009
01:55:43.290 --> 01:55:47.370
or maybe it's back to my original point that of guys are going to roll around on

2010
01:55:47.371 --> 01:55:50.940
the ground all the time and your franchise decides to do something about that.

2011
01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:54.930
That maybe makes it more exciting because in wrestling it is rolling around on

2012
01:55:54.931 --> 01:55:56.760
the ground and I,
and I think,

2013
01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.950
<v 2>you know,
it's trying to take each other down.</v>

2014
01:55:59.951 --> 01:56:02.880
It's battling those [inaudible]

2015
01:56:03.590 --> 01:56:05.810
<v 3>ground.
Yeah.
You can only win on the ground.</v>

2016
01:56:06.770 --> 01:56:10.700
And so the sport is a matte sport.
That's one of the years.
Right.
You know,

2017
01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:14.870
you know this,
you know right here.
And I do.
And I think,
you know,
there's still,

2018
01:56:14.871 --> 01:56:19.400
I don't know what it is,
whether it was boxing or whatever it is,

2019
01:56:19.401 --> 01:56:24.020
where it's ingrained in us that you want to see guys fight at least some of the

2020
01:56:24.021 --> 01:56:28.070
time standing up.
I think the UFC,
you know,
it has added to,
you know,

2021
01:56:28.490 --> 01:56:31.760
the change in what we think of fight looks like without a doubt.

2022
01:56:31.761 --> 01:56:34.370
But you still want to see guys stand up and you know,

2023
01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:38.420
even the wrestlers at some point want to prove they can do that too.

2024
01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:40.940
Hmm.
Maybe.

2025
01:56:41.730 --> 01:56:42.240
<v 2>But uh,</v>

2026
01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.560
I mean I think ultimately MMA is always going to be the most exciting form of

2027
01:56:46.561 --> 01:56:50.970
combat sports cause it's everything combined.
But no argument here,
my friend.

2028
01:56:50.971 --> 01:56:55.800
But I love kickboxing.
I love boxing and I love Jujitsu.
I will love to,

2029
01:56:55.860 --> 01:57:00.030
I would pay without a doubt to see worldclass professional Jujitsu guys like

2030
01:57:00.031 --> 01:57:03.540
chalk arrayed,
guys like Marcella Garcia just going at it.
Submission,
grappling.

2031
01:57:03.650 --> 01:57:04.030
Yeah.

2032
01:57:04.030 --> 01:57:07.090
<v 3>You're,
you're,
you're,
you're in a very elite group.
You know,</v>

2033
01:57:07.091 --> 01:57:10.300
you're in a very efficient [inaudible],
you know,
very high end group.
Okay.

2034
01:57:10.350 --> 01:57:13.830
<v 2>Do you know who?
I'd still think people watch tennis.</v>

2035
01:57:13.980 --> 01:57:17.630
Who gives a fuck of that ball goes across that net.
I don't give a shit.
People,

2036
01:57:17.631 --> 01:57:21.770
people watching us,
thousands of people in the stands,
millions around the world.

2037
01:57:21.790 --> 01:57:26.100
Watch something that's on its best day is not nearly as exciting as a Marcello

2038
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:26.970
Garcia strangulation.

2039
01:57:28.650 --> 01:57:31.410
Marcello Garcia takes you back and get those hooks in and got out.

2040
01:57:31.890 --> 01:57:36.890
Highlight that quote that let's pull up Marcello Garcia versus victor versus

2041
01:57:37.231 --> 01:57:38.700
Shaolin Victor Shaolin

2042
01:57:38.930 --> 01:57:41.750
<v 3>he borrowed.
While he's doing that,
you know what big John said to me?
He said,</v>

2043
01:57:41.751 --> 01:57:45.770
MMA is the best sport for women to do because if you watch women's basketball,

2044
01:57:45.771 --> 01:57:46.880
you watch women's tennis.

2045
01:57:47.180 --> 01:57:50.870
The upper body strength is obviously lacking in those sports.

2046
01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:55.230
MMA leverage skill more below the hill,
you know,

2047
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:57.560
below the waist and the legs are important.
Yeah,

2048
01:57:57.590 --> 01:58:01.700
<v 2>watch this shit.
What's it look at this arm.
Drag Lucas a spin to the back.</v>

2049
01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:05.120
Come on son.
And then his strangulation.
Not only that,

2050
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:08.150
he's doing it to a world class Brazilian Jujitsu,
black belt,

2051
01:58:08.151 --> 01:58:12.320
and he puts them out fucking cold.
Look at this.
You tell me.
That's not exciting.

2052
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:16.310
I'll tell you this.
I'm fucking wrong with you.
Look at that night night sun,

2053
01:58:16.970 --> 01:58:20.120
Marcella Garcia Bitch mean.

2054
01:58:20.900 --> 01:58:24.170
You can argue then who the fuck would not want to watch them on television?

2055
01:58:24.370 --> 01:58:27.550
You just need more guys like that.
How long was that?
It was 15 seconds.

2056
01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:30.470
I was going to say 20 savings.
Watch it again.

2057
01:58:30.770 --> 01:58:34.730
Watch it again when he takes his back.
This is,
this is a technique and this is,

2058
01:58:34.731 --> 01:58:37.820
there's beauty in this.
People can look back up all the way back,

2059
01:58:37.821 --> 01:58:39.290
all the way back,
all the way back.
Although it back,

2060
01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.950
watch how he like takes his back.
Watch his arm,

2061
01:58:41.951 --> 01:58:46.540
drag the left hand to his right hand,
right hand and the arm pit spins,

2062
01:58:46.630 --> 01:58:49.320
takes the back,
keeps going,
keeps spinning and keeps Ben and keeps bending,

2063
01:58:49.330 --> 01:58:52.840
keeps bending.
Shalon tries to recover.
The arm goes underneath the chin.

2064
01:58:53.170 --> 01:58:55.180
He tries to get you even get them on the side.

2065
01:58:55.181 --> 01:58:58.450
He's not even fully like locked in with both hooks in.

2066
01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:02.050
He's almost in a half guard with a rear naked and puts him

2067
01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:03.153
<v 3>out.</v>

2068
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:08.470
<v 2>If you don't think that that would be exciting on TV.
Every match was like that,</v>

2069
01:59:08.471 --> 01:59:10.120
but they don't have to be all like that.

2070
01:59:10.121 --> 01:59:14.350
It's the potential for that is what makes you pull one up from memory.

2071
01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:18.700
It was exactly as you described it.
You did great commentary.
I'm in awe,

2072
01:59:18.760 --> 01:59:22.510
but just like what I'm saying with baseball,
if every time a guy went to bat,

2073
01:59:22.570 --> 01:59:25.690
he hit a home run,
then it would be much more exciting.
Right?

2074
01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:27.700
So let's make people throw the ball slower.

2075
01:59:27.730 --> 01:59:32.140
Let's make the or the nineties with steroids.
But even then it never happened.

2076
01:59:32.260 --> 01:59:36.730
No one's ever done that.
So like every fight can't be knockouts with kickboxing.

2077
01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:41.440
Every fight that you see in a Jujitsu match can't be Marcella Garcia strangling

2078
01:59:41.441 --> 01:59:41.890
absolute.

2079
01:59:41.890 --> 01:59:46.450
But it's the potential for those amazing moments that make the dull spots more

2080
01:59:46.451 --> 01:59:47.284
important.

2081
01:59:47.620 --> 01:59:50.500
<v 3>Um,
you know,
you raise a great point.
Um,</v>

2082
01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:54.550
but let me ask you this because now I'm looking for a new audience and maybe an

2083
01:59:54.551 --> 01:59:58.090
audience that literally would not understand what you just said.

2084
01:59:58.120 --> 02:00:01.690
Not just because they,
they don't speak English,
they do speak English,

2085
02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:04.030
but just because they don't have the background.
I mean,

2086
02:00:04.031 --> 02:00:06.670
your background's phenomenal.
They can't even come to your party.

2087
02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:11.060
They're not even on the wait list to get into what you're talking about.
So how,

2088
02:00:11.190 --> 02:00:14.140
how does UFC grow?
How does MMA grow?

2089
02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:19.240
Is it bringing more of a highly,
you know,

2090
02:00:19.241 --> 02:00:22.450
when you go to,
you said you weren't a baseball fan.
I know you're from Boston.

2091
02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:25.790
<v 2>I played baseball when I was a kid.
I found martial arts.
I wasn't busy.</v>

2092
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:28.590
<v 3>So you go to,
you go to Fenway,
you go to Yankee stadium,</v>

2093
02:00:28.650 --> 02:00:33.450
the crowd knows what's happening,
right?
But if you go the Marlins game,

2094
02:00:33.451 --> 02:00:37.800
you know there's places where you go and the fans clearly not into the baseball

2095
02:00:37.801 --> 02:00:42.020
as much.
Right?
So I think the UFC is it,
um,
I don't know if it's a,

2096
02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:45.540
it's not a crucial point for the UFC at all.
UFC is doing great,

2097
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:47.460
but how do you reach a new audience?

2098
02:00:47.461 --> 02:00:51.720
How do you spread out your calling up fights?
When was that fight?

2099
02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:56.400
When that was thousand three,
11 fucking years ago,

2100
02:00:56.401 --> 02:00:57.000
Joe.

2101
02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.780
And you're calling that up from memory and it exactly is what you were talking

2102
02:01:00.781 --> 02:01:03.900
about.
How do we reach a new audience that can't do that,

2103
02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:09.200
that say someone has 1000th of your knowledge and that's probably still more

2104
02:01:09.631 --> 02:01:12.870
than what a lot of people have,
right?
How are we going to reach him?

2105
02:01:12.871 --> 02:01:14.430
How are we going to tell them about this sport?

2106
02:01:15.010 --> 02:01:18.670
<v 2>Well,
you don't have to,
they don't have to know what I know to enjoy it.</v>

2107
02:01:18.730 --> 02:01:21.040
You know what I am is what,
you know,

2108
02:01:21.041 --> 02:01:25.270
what I represent proudly is the hardcore fan.
I get to talk,

2109
02:01:25.330 --> 02:01:27.190
I'm the hardcore fan that gets to talk and I,

2110
02:01:27.191 --> 02:01:30.850
that's one of the reasons why I still post on mixed martial arts.com.
I still,

2111
02:01:30.851 --> 02:01:35.470
you know,
have a combat sports forum on my own message board.
I'm,

2112
02:01:35.471 --> 02:01:38.610
you're on the underground cause I always see Logan reads this.

2113
02:01:38.611 --> 02:01:39.990
So Joe it all the time.
I

2114
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:42.950
<v 1>read it every day.
And I think that that's important that I,</v>

2115
02:01:42.951 --> 02:01:46.040
I take great pride in the fact that I represent those guys,

2116
02:01:46.041 --> 02:01:50.460
those fucking savages,
those,
those are my people.
And um,
but do,

2117
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:53.330
you don't have to tribe.
Yeah,
but you don't have to be me.
You know,

2118
02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.190
if someone just a casual person could appreciate fighting because it's you,

2119
02:01:57.191 --> 02:02:00.350
you just watching it,
it's exciting watching that.

2120
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:02.390
You didn't have to be able to call that arm draw,

2121
02:02:02.450 --> 02:02:05.690
dragged to the back and point out that he's choking them out from actually a

2122
02:02:05.691 --> 02:02:07.790
half guard position almost.
It doesn't matter.

2123
02:02:07.791 --> 02:02:11.750
You're still knowing what's going on.
If you know it's a choke and it's exciting.

2124
02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:16.030
<v 3>Look,
UFC one,
Denver,
Colorado,
mcnichols arena,</v>

2125
02:02:16.031 --> 02:02:19.390
you know what I read in the New York Times was talking about how the UFC was

2126
02:02:19.391 --> 02:02:23.650
started on the edges of the fringes of society.
And you know,

2127
02:02:23.860 --> 02:02:27.230
my office was at Park Avenue and 57th street,
you know,

2128
02:02:27.250 --> 02:02:30.730
Bertelsmann one of the biggest media companies in the world owned the company.

2129
02:02:31.160 --> 02:02:34.120
John Millie has helped create,
you know,
it was ridiculous.
And you know,

2130
02:02:34.121 --> 02:02:37.750
we were in mcnichols arena,
which you're very famous,
you know,
big arena.

2131
02:02:38.110 --> 02:02:42.130
And so we're there and it's hoist versus um,
the assassin.

2132
02:02:42.160 --> 02:02:47.110
What Gerard Gordo and cause I think he really wasn't assassin,
you know,

2133
02:02:47.111 --> 02:02:49.900
cause he just had that look and uh,

2134
02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:52.750
they do the fight and hoists gets them on the ground and it's,

2135
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:56.710
he does his pies and thing that gets in and he chokes on many taps.

2136
02:02:57.310 --> 02:02:59.860
And Damn Front there's a,
there's a gentleman,

2137
02:02:59.861 --> 02:03:04.460
and I don't know if he actually was a pimp,
maybe he was a pimp,
but he had a,

2138
02:03:04.461 --> 02:03:07.180
a one of those full end fur coats.

2139
02:03:07.480 --> 02:03:09.880
And he did have a purple hat with a feather in it.

2140
02:03:10.720 --> 02:03:13.930
And he did have two women on each side of him and the women,

2141
02:03:13.990 --> 02:03:16.840
I'm not saying they were prostitutes,

2142
02:03:16.841 --> 02:03:20.440
but they certainly could play a prostitute in a movie with what they were

2143
02:03:20.441 --> 02:03:22.470
wearing.
Right.
And so they're watching,

2144
02:03:22.471 --> 02:03:25.240
watching a voice chokes him unconscious into,
or he taps,

2145
02:03:25.241 --> 02:03:28.810
he doesn't go unconscious and the pimps stands or the guy stands up and he goes,

2146
02:03:29.980 --> 02:03:30.550
somebody

2147
02:03:30.550 --> 02:03:33.660
<v 1>bullshit.
I've seen two hoes fight</v>

2148
02:03:33.690 --> 02:03:38.400
<v 3>better than that.
And,
you know,
and I busted God,
I go,</v>

2149
02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:41.850
you know,
I,
I don't want to say I have to,

2150
02:03:41.870 --> 02:03:45.030
cause I can't really say if I've seen two hose fight.
But you know,

2151
02:03:45.031 --> 02:03:46.350
I knew I took his point.

2152
02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:50.880
And I think you've got to remember that joke is we're going forward with this

2153
02:03:50.881 --> 02:03:52.830
sport.
It's hard.

2154
02:03:52.831 --> 02:03:56.760
It's hard to come to the UFC for 54 95 and try it out.
Right.

2155
02:03:57.090 --> 02:03:59.460
And it's hard to turn on the TV and this is,
you know,

2156
02:03:59.461 --> 02:04:04.130
I really do love you and I admire you and I respect you.
And I did,
you know,

2157
02:04:04.150 --> 02:04:07.530
and that's why I wanted you in the UFC and I figured you could,
you know,

2158
02:04:07.620 --> 02:04:10.890
sort of save it.
That's why you sorta came in and,

2159
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:14.970
but I think that there's a whole group of people when they turn on,
they go,

2160
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:16.470
what the fuck

2161
02:04:16.670 --> 02:04:18.610
<v 1>and what is that guy talking about?</v>

2162
02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:23.180
Did you ever think that I was going to save it?
First of all,
I definitely did.

2163
02:04:23.181 --> 02:04:24.230
If you've said about it,

2164
02:04:24.230 --> 02:04:27.800
<v 3>the UFC,
the dark ages and it was the most disorganized.</v>

2165
02:04:27.850 --> 02:04:28.040
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

2166
02:04:28.040 --> 02:04:32.260
Why did you think that bringing in the comedian can in some some ways because

2167
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:33.250
Comedians,

2168
02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:37.980
<v 3>a Dj's are professional talkers,
professional</v>

2169
02:04:37.980 --> 02:04:41.490
<v 4>talkers.
We needed a professional talker.
You had a great persona,</v>

2170
02:04:41.580 --> 02:04:44.700
you had a great look.
You look the part,
you know,
uh,
you're,

2171
02:04:44.701 --> 02:04:48.060
you're much more buff now,
but you looked apart back then when Ann,

2172
02:04:48.061 --> 02:04:51.690
I thought you were going to be the guy that was going to try to figure it out

2173
02:04:51.691 --> 02:04:54.840
and explain it to people.
And if you had to do time,

2174
02:04:55.050 --> 02:04:58.020
remember in a comedy club when someone did this,
you could do that,
right?

2175
02:04:58.021 --> 02:05:01.920
I know you could stretch,
right?
So I knew you were going to be able to do that.

2176
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:05.620
And to me it was a really good move.
You know,
it was a,

2177
02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:09.540
it was a very strong move to give a public face,

2178
02:05:09.541 --> 02:05:14.520
a persona in front of the UFC that wasn't talking about human cockfighting and

2179
02:05:14.521 --> 02:05:17.070
why it was really okay and were really nice guys.

2180
02:05:17.250 --> 02:05:19.710
You could go out and just pump the shit out of it.

2181
02:05:19.860 --> 02:05:23.400
You weren't apologizing for anything.
You,
you were really,
you were,

2182
02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:26.130
you were the perfect guy for the job,
Joe.
You really were.

2183
02:05:26.190 --> 02:05:29.950
There wasn't anyone else.
I would have rather had honest to God.
Well that's,

2184
02:05:30.100 --> 02:05:33.900
I guess I'm pro,
I'm proven right.
Well,
you were,

2185
02:05:33.901 --> 02:05:35.400
you were a ahead of your time.

2186
02:05:36.900 --> 02:05:39.900
I just thought it was going to be just this ridiculous job that I would keep for

2187
02:05:39.901 --> 02:05:44.240
a short amount of time.
Oh,
I could had Jay more for that.
Ah,

2188
02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:50.080
Jay.
Um,
when you're compared to,
you know,
there's comparisons between,
you know,

2189
02:05:50.081 --> 02:05:52.590
you,
there's a similarity and you may not like to hear this.

2190
02:05:52.860 --> 02:05:56.790
You're both tough guys and your persona.
Stop right there.
Back Up.

2191
02:05:56.870 --> 02:06:00.180
Erase your words.
Washing mouth.
I would say get the fuck out of here.

2192
02:06:00.390 --> 02:06:04.200
I want your audience to know what balls I have to said that on Joe.

2193
02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:08.700
Show to a job and you're a three and a half feet away.
Are you,

2194
02:06:09.220 --> 02:06:13.500
um,
when you watch the UFC today,
what,
if anything,

2195
02:06:13.530 --> 02:06:15.810
would you change?
Nothing.
Nothing.

2196
02:06:16.260 --> 02:06:19.320
You don't think there's anything that needs to be fixed?
Rules wise.

2197
02:06:19.890 --> 02:06:22.890
What about the 12 to six elbow?
That's some ridiculous shit.
You know,

2198
02:06:22.891 --> 02:06:27.540
you can't do that.
You know,
everything in context,
everything is in context.

2199
02:06:27.541 --> 02:06:28.950
It's not coming out of thin air.

2200
02:06:28.980 --> 02:06:32.250
Things are the way they are because over the course of 20 years,

2201
02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:35.280
I think Dana and Lorenzo and you and Joe,

2202
02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.710
you don't have figured out the best,

2203
02:06:38.190 --> 02:06:42.990
I don't want to say compromise because compromise is a word that it implies.

2204
02:06:43.290 --> 02:06:45.590
You're not doing your best,
but you,

2205
02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:50.900
you all have found the best way to promote this as a sport and yet still have,

2206
02:06:51.210 --> 02:06:54.930
it's still a fight.
It's still crazy.
It's still a fight.

2207
02:06:55.380 --> 02:07:00.110
GSP fight.
That was our fight,
man.
I was sick.
That was,
that was a fight.

2208
02:07:00.111 --> 02:07:04.920
I was a full on fight.
You know,
and you know,
and so when I see that,

2209
02:07:04.921 --> 02:07:08.190
and there's a lot of UFC now,
there's a lot of UFC,

2210
02:07:08.191 --> 02:07:13.191
so there's going to be somewhat of a variety of quality and know the fights just

2211
02:07:14.121 --> 02:07:16.860
cause that's how it is.
There's a lot of baseballs,
summer,
great games,

2212
02:07:16.861 --> 02:07:21.150
some aren't.
But I think the consistent level,
the UFC is what impresses me.

2213
02:07:21.151 --> 02:07:24.630
I mean it's generally always good.

2214
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:28.710
Do you think it's good to have one predominant mixed martial arts country

2215
02:07:28.740 --> 02:07:31.410
company?
Do you think?
As long as it's a UFC,
yes.

2216
02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:37.000
Anyone else that go monopoly Scott.
And now it's the UFC.

2217
02:07:37.001 --> 02:07:41.620
Everybody else pack up your bags and go home.
Just leave.

2218
02:07:41.621 --> 02:07:45.970
Just get out of the business.
What do you mean it's the UFC you mean?

2219
02:07:45.970 --> 02:07:49.450
So you don't think that like a company like Bella Tor is legitimate or
important?

2220
02:07:50.410 --> 02:07:54.790
No,
I don't really important to who?
For what?
For fighters.
For Spike.

2221
02:07:54.791 --> 02:07:58.000
Maybe while for fighters,
for providers to have other venues.

2222
02:07:58.510 --> 02:08:03.510
I am sure that if there were no other franchises that there would be a system

2223
02:08:06.340 --> 02:08:09.720
put in place by the UFC to not,
to,

2224
02:08:09.780 --> 02:08:13.810
to totally utilize the talent that's gone.
Then aspirin.
I like them a lot.

2225
02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:18.220
Good luck at one FC.
Eddie Alvarez.
Eddy is,
I really like Eddie.
Michael Chandler,

2226
02:08:18.730 --> 02:08:23.710
Chandler,
another one.
Yeah,
there's good fighters,
but there's only one UFC.

2227
02:08:23.770 --> 02:08:28.150
I mean you've got a sprinkling of good fighters elsewhere,

2228
02:08:28.690 --> 02:08:33.640
but the other franchises,
they're lame.
They're just lame.
Well,
um,
I think,

2229
02:08:33.641 --> 02:08:35.890
and you know,
they're lame.
Why don't think their lane,

2230
02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.720
but you don't want to say it because anybody goes,
oh,

2231
02:08:37.721 --> 02:08:40.840
he's a shill for the UFC truth.
Truth is truth.
Okay.

2232
02:08:40.841 --> 02:08:43.510
I don't think Bella Tours lame.
I don't really know.

2233
02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:46.570
I can't even follow the tournament.
You know my tournaments,
good fight.

2234
02:08:46.571 --> 02:08:49.090
Three hours.
My tournament was in three hours.

2235
02:08:49.091 --> 02:08:51.750
Their tournaments are like three months.
I don't even remember.

2236
02:08:51.770 --> 02:08:52.690
They're doing it the right way.

2237
02:08:52.691 --> 02:08:54.490
They're not having people fight more than once a night.

2238
02:08:54.520 --> 02:08:57.700
I think that's a good thing.
I think your tournaments out who won,

2239
02:08:57.850 --> 02:09:02.080
I think your tournament's that we did were traits that have nothing to do with

2240
02:09:02.081 --> 02:09:05.050
the tournament's in everything to do with who they just signed.
Right.

2241
02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:08.440
That's true.
So that's kind of bullshit.
Well that is a little weird,

2242
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:12.850
but they should be able to do that.
I bled.
No,
go on rock fan.

2243
02:09:13.210 --> 02:09:16.900
I'm not necessarily a fan of the tournament form,
which is better.
Bellator,
UFC,

2244
02:09:17.250 --> 02:09:20.080
UFC.
Yeah,
for sure.
That's my point.
But I still watch it.

2245
02:09:20.110 --> 02:09:21.240
I still watch Bella to our fights.

2246
02:09:21.250 --> 02:09:25.510
I look forward series of fighting Eddie Alvarez and um,
and Michael Chandler.

2247
02:09:25.511 --> 02:09:28.290
That was a great rock and fight.
That second fight in the first five.

2248
02:09:28.420 --> 02:09:30.220
Both of them were granted once.
You'd be good too.

2249
02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:32.860
Why would you not want to watch that?
I do want to Jimmy Smith,

2250
02:09:32.861 --> 02:09:35.980
the guy who does my job in the UFC is great.
He's,
in my opinion,

2251
02:09:35.981 --> 02:09:38.400
he's one of the best in the world that he's an MMA comment too.

2252
02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:40.630
I think he's really good.
He knows his shit.

2253
02:09:40.631 --> 02:09:42.790
He knows his shit when it comes to striking and knows.

2254
02:09:42.940 --> 02:09:46.590
He knows the transitions and the ground.
He knows when,
when a guys in danger,

2255
02:09:46.600 --> 02:09:49.210
he knows when a guy's okay.
He's,
he's,
he's,

2256
02:09:49.260 --> 02:09:52.000
but he doesn't seem like he's gonna explode.

2257
02:09:52.330 --> 02:09:55.900
You seem to be red lining from the moment the camera goes on.

2258
02:09:55.901 --> 02:10:00.160
It's like red light,
red light.
Yeah.
Well that's intense man.

2259
02:10:00.580 --> 02:10:04.270
No,
it's you.
That's me.
Well,
when I like when we first did fox,

2260
02:10:04.271 --> 02:10:08.020
the first thing they were talking in my ear telling me to calm down,

2261
02:10:08.410 --> 02:10:10.360
take it down a notch.
And I'm just like,

2262
02:10:10.361 --> 02:10:12.370
I can't believe anybody is telling me to take it down a notch.

2263
02:10:12.490 --> 02:10:16.960
Like they wanted it to be,
fuck sports,
this is what's going on tonight.

2264
02:10:16.961 --> 02:10:20.110
Junior dos Santos out of Brazil.
And um,
you know,

2265
02:10:20.140 --> 02:10:24.970
I'm like two men enter several steps ahead of that and red in the neck.

2266
02:10:25.190 --> 02:10:28.900
My veins are pumping out and I'm ready to fucking explode and I'm excited for

2267
02:10:28.901 --> 02:10:31.150
real legitimately,
you know,
so I don't think they liked,

2268
02:10:31.151 --> 02:10:34.040
that's what I like about it.
That's why I think that's why again,
it's,

2269
02:10:34.100 --> 02:10:38.970
<v 2>it is a sport and uh,
but it's more,
it's a sport of fighting.
Yeah.
Yeah.</v>

2270
02:10:39.090 --> 02:10:42.230
Well,
it's the purest example,
the purest expression of competition.

2271
02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:47.330
What would any likes board about is whether it's basketball,
you know,

2272
02:10:47.331 --> 02:10:48.164
that's fixed.

2273
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:53.290
Basketball is two men competing to try to do a specific goal to get their ball

2274
02:10:53.481 --> 02:10:57.770
into a hole.
But it's just,
they're competing through this metaphor.
No,

2275
02:10:57.890 --> 02:11:00.300
we're talking about basketball.
I said basketball,

2276
02:11:00.340 --> 02:11:03.470
basketball's and basketball game,
which you play against gravity.

2277
02:11:03.530 --> 02:11:06.950
That's what basketball and other people that are playing against you.

2278
02:11:06.951 --> 02:11:10.400
But the dominance of another man by slam dunking a ball in his face,

2279
02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:12.540
it doesn't mean much.
It's only,

2280
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:15.730
it only means something because you choose to that cock fighting thing.

2281
02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:20.160
What she teaches dominating people when you,
when a guy balls in their faces.
Oh,

2282
02:11:20.161 --> 02:11:23.210
I said we slam dunk a ball.
That's what I said.
You getting a little,

2283
02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:27.470
I need more of the boat too hard.
We are out of it.
That's it.
We drank it all.

2284
02:11:27.471 --> 02:11:28.780
You can't,
you can't drink too much wine.

2285
02:11:28.790 --> 02:11:33.180
Have you have a heart attack on the show?
Too much caffeine is not.

2286
02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:38.020
Is that good for our ratings?
Can I plug my Twitter Joe?
Everyone said my,

2287
02:11:38.050 --> 02:11:41.410
my Twitter is embarrassing.
Dana has 2.8 million.

2288
02:11:41.411 --> 02:11:44.530
I haven't started out your fucking,
you've had at Twitter for a week.

2289
02:11:44.890 --> 02:11:47.950
How long have you had Twitter for?
Um,
my daughter helped me put it up,

2290
02:11:47.951 --> 02:11:50.740
I think Tuesday.
Yeah.
Come on man.
Look,

2291
02:11:50.890 --> 02:11:52.600
how much did you have when you started this show?

2292
02:11:54.060 --> 02:11:58.760
207 now you got 482 so what I'm talking about sambo combined today.

2293
02:11:58.800 --> 02:12:03.310
Come on.

C.
O.

2294
02:12:03.690 --> 02:12:06.090
Don't talk while I'm trying to plug your fucking Twitter man.

2295
02:12:06.520 --> 02:12:10.590
He's crazy about it.
This
Campbell combat,

2296
02:12:10.591 --> 02:12:15.020
they see I work alone.
Usually go,
oh my gosh,
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

2297
02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:17.820
Oh my God.

Tay,
why didn't you just go with Campbell Mclaren?

2300
02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:28.810
Did somebody already have that?
I didn't think of that.
Jesus Christ.

2301
02:12:29.230 --> 02:12:32.080
What if this fucking show gets canceled then you're still stuck with this

2302
02:12:32.081 --> 02:12:36.550
combined yet.
I'm getting off Twitter.
I don't want to hear from these
kids.

2303
02:12:36.990 --> 02:12:39.740
Say that you can say that you fucking,
you,

2304
02:12:40.030 --> 02:12:43.270
you're tanking your whole operation online to social media thing.

2305
02:12:43.271 --> 02:12:46.960
Right off the bat.
No,
I gotta be me.
You got you gotta be you.
I gotta be me.

2306
02:12:47.020 --> 02:12:51.520
I appreciate that man.
I appreciate that.
What else you got going on?
I'm,
you know,

2307
02:12:51.521 --> 02:12:54.490
I'm really focused on this,
uh,
combined day.
America's,
I like it a lot.

2308
02:12:54.491 --> 02:12:59.230
It's the first.
It's the thing,
you know,
it,
you know,
it sounds cliche.

2309
02:12:59.231 --> 02:13:01.330
I'm as excited about it as I was 20 years ago.

2310
02:13:01.450 --> 02:13:06.220
It's cool because there's a bunch of people that I go MMA,
they go,
is that,

2311
02:13:06.221 --> 02:13:08.440
what is that?
I mean they really ask that.

2312
02:13:08.470 --> 02:13:12.370
I have to bring this up because this is one of my favorite stories that you ever

2313
02:13:12.371 --> 02:13:16.900
told me.
Oh No.
Ron Van Cleef.
Oh,
what a fucker.

2314
02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.350
Me Or him?
Not You.
No,
no.
You gotta tell me which you go.

2315
02:13:23.390 --> 02:13:26.820
Tell me what it was like first he came to the office.

2316
02:13:26.821 --> 02:13:31.120
I'm thankfully it came to the office with disciples dragon with disciples.

2317
02:13:31.680 --> 02:13:34.950
This is an insult to say,
tell me how,
tell me the whole story.

2318
02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:39.950
<v 4>Is there,
is there a picture of him?
Help Inspire Jamie.
We'll pull one up.
Ron.</v>

2319
02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.410
You Know Ron van Cleef is a weird guy,
right?
I mean it feels weird guy.
Uh,

2320
02:13:44.411 --> 02:13:49.030
I think he was 50 when he came into the UFC five.
Oh,
maybe even 51.

2321
02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.410
Yeah.
Cause he came in and he said,
um,
and then we were,

2322
02:13:53.830 --> 02:13:55.870
I forget which one it was,
would've been six

2323
02:13:56.290 --> 02:13:58.800
<v 2>was uh,
yeah,
it was somewhere in,</v>

2324
02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:03.030
he had some other involvement with the UFC before that,
correct?

2325
02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:07.340
<v 4>No,
he did the fight and then he became the commissioner.
Oh,
okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Um,</v>

2326
02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.360
so he came in,
he said he was going to do the,
um,
um,

2327
02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:15.620
the New York City Marathon.
I go,
all right,
finish that.
And I forget.
You know,

2328
02:14:15.621 --> 02:14:17.690
I set a time,
finish that and then we'll talk.

2329
02:14:17.691 --> 02:14:20.450
But the last thing I wanted was some 50 year old guy.

2330
02:14:20.451 --> 02:14:23.110
You don't have them fucking die talking about UFC.
I mean,
that,

2331
02:14:23.111 --> 02:14:27.230
that's not even like good for the buy rate.
Yeah.
Pull up the video of him.

2332
02:14:27.380 --> 02:14:32.000
His fight against hoists.
Gracie rundown please.
He fights getting lots of doubt.

2333
02:14:32.090 --> 02:14:35.570
God did luck out that he fought Tracy.
Right.
The voice.
Yeah.
You know,

2334
02:14:35.571 --> 02:14:38.600
and voices that gentleman,
he didn't want to hurt the old guy.
Well,

2335
02:14:38.630 --> 02:14:41.270
Ron van Cleef was a legit karate fighter.

2336
02:14:41.300 --> 02:14:45.500
There's some really good footage of him fighting.
He was,
he was very fast.

2337
02:14:45.501 --> 02:14:49.620
He was a real karate guy.
I think he did a lot for,
you know,

2338
02:14:49.850 --> 02:14:54.800
say the community.
He,
he helped inspire poor kids at a time when,

2339
02:14:55.070 --> 02:14:55.311
you know,

2340
02:14:55.311 --> 02:14:58.670
in the sixties and seventies there weren't a lot of good role models and I think

2341
02:14:58.671 --> 02:15:01.580
he was a pretty good role model.
And I think what I took,

2342
02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:03.410
you know he did an art Davey,
you know,

2343
02:15:03.411 --> 02:15:07.250
he did like an end run on the UFC and try to start something else while he was

2344
02:15:07.270 --> 02:15:07.930
underpaid.

2345
02:15:07.930 --> 02:15:11.360
<v 2>You guys just call girls looks good.
Damn.</v>

2346
02:15:11.390 --> 02:15:16.390
Look how thick these ring car girls were back to is that staging the Latina feed

2347
02:15:17.051 --> 02:15:20.590
these girls.
So yeah,

2348
02:15:20.670 --> 02:15:23.710
I'm holy Mackerel old old school man.
Look at the,

2349
02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:27.130
even that padding around the octagon.
Look at Leo still spry.

2350
02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:29.040
<v 4>Look at the padding around the octagon yet.</v>

2351
02:15:29.041 --> 02:15:32.160
It was actually the shipping material that we sent the octagon it and,

2352
02:15:32.161 --> 02:15:34.350
and then we just unwrapped it and use that again.
Look at

2353
02:15:34.350 --> 02:15:39.030
<v 2>that with zip ties around.
Yeah,
that's hilarious.
Holy Shit.</v>

2354
02:15:39.031 --> 02:15:43.800
And then Ron van Cleef at 50 years old with a tie Mac behind him.

2355
02:15:43.890 --> 02:15:47.550
Who is the star of the last dragon?
No,
he,

2356
02:15:47.551 --> 02:15:50.420
it was like the next to the last dragon,
wasn't it?
No.

2357
02:15:50.421 --> 02:15:55.200
Is that he was the one where he played a Bruce Lee Roy member.
Yes,

2358
02:15:55.201 --> 02:15:58.320
I do remember.
And he was in some wacky MTV thing too.

2359
02:15:59.050 --> 02:16:02.590
Well he was a real athlete is a real martial artist.
Yeah.

2360
02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:04.590
But nothing ever happened to him after that.

2361
02:16:04.591 --> 02:16:09.080
He's like he did that movie the last dragon and then and then,
okay you,

2362
02:16:09.081 --> 02:16:11.950
you cut way ahead.
It's a um,
it's this,

2363
02:16:12.030 --> 02:16:15.450
you got to see the take down cause it happens like seconds in.

2364
02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:17.820
And this is what happens when,

2365
02:16:18.030 --> 02:16:20.800
you know a karate guy sleep during that.
Yeah.

2366
02:16:20.850 --> 02:16:25.020
Well they knew what this was about as close to a four far gone conclusion,

2367
02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:28.700
forgone conclusion.
How's that expression go?
Forgone as a,

2368
02:16:28.710 --> 02:16:33.710
you ever get a hoists was 27 years old and the prime of his life and he just

2369
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:37.710
came out through a keg duct on there.
Look at that beautiful duck.

2370
02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:42.040
It started out with a front kick to measure distance and then came down with

2371
02:16:42.041 --> 02:16:46.780
that kick into the take down.
And that's a wrap.
I mean,
he just got ahold,

2372
02:16:47.020 --> 02:16:50.740
got ahold of Ron van Cleef,
and this is just academic from here on in.

2373
02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:52.720
Ron's not going to advance position.

2374
02:16:52.721 --> 02:16:55.840
He's never going to get out of side control legs,
voices just,
yeah,

2375
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:57.310
he's just taking his time here.

2376
02:16:57.490 --> 02:17:01.270
He's waiting for Ron to relax or make a mistake or whatever.

2377
02:17:01.420 --> 02:17:05.410
And hoists was a master at that to master where they would call cooking guys

2378
02:17:05.650 --> 02:17:06.490
that you cook them,

2379
02:17:06.520 --> 02:17:10.300
hold them down and then once you got them down and you decide that you're going

2380
02:17:10.301 --> 02:17:13.270
to mount them,
you start sliding that left knee up.

2381
02:17:13.270 --> 02:17:17.980
He would get that left knee in between the space of the two legs.
Go back to it.

2382
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:22.120
I'll get that off there.
What ad?
Who gives a shit show the fight.

2383
02:17:23.380 --> 02:17:25.030
Um,
so he,
he's got,

2384
02:17:25.031 --> 02:17:29.650
I'm holding down here and Ron van Cleef literally had no idea what to do.

2385
02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:32.620
He never thought he was going to be in this position.
He thought that,

2386
02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:36.550
why didn't he?
Because he's a karate master though.
He's like,
we brought emails.

2387
02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:39.160
Dot.
Hoists shouldn't matter it.
Look at it in the voice.

2388
02:17:39.190 --> 02:17:41.050
Slowly but surely it takes them back.

2389
02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:46.090
He slowly but surely use that left leg spun around and I was full mount

2390
02:17:47.900 --> 02:17:51.680
and then here Jim Brown.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I know.
Here it goes.

2391
02:17:51.681 --> 02:17:53.030
He saved this in the Jim Brown

2392
02:17:54.010 --> 02:17:56.540
<v 9>hydrate.
It totally works for tea.</v>

2393
02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:01.180
<v 2>Oh he was talking about hoist to at least,
uh,
losing the chemo.</v>

2394
02:18:01.210 --> 02:18:03.780
That's what they're talking about.
Cause you remember that at a,

2395
02:18:03.790 --> 02:18:08.260
not losing the chemo but chemo and then then leaving the fight when he was

2396
02:18:08.261 --> 02:18:12.160
supposed to find out chemo came into that fight.
Yeah.

2397
02:18:12.161 --> 02:18:15.190
With a cross with Joe Sohn who turned out to be a gang rapists,

2398
02:18:15.191 --> 02:18:17.920
you know about all that of course.
But that cross,
you know,

2399
02:18:17.921 --> 02:18:20.110
that was not a display cross.

2400
02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:24.870
No fucking like hundred pound cross.
Yeah,
I'd probably worry,

2401
02:18:24.880 --> 02:18:26.270
wait at least a hundred pounds.
You know,

2402
02:18:26.271 --> 02:18:27.790
they brought that in in like four different,

2403
02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:32.470
these giant gym bags kind of like sewn together,
came in with I go,
dude,

2404
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.750
what's up with that?
They go,
uh,

2405
02:18:34.810 --> 02:18:38.770
training equipment and back then no one even knew that he was going to come out

2406
02:18:38.771 --> 02:18:41.380
strapped to a cross.
No Man.
That's hilarious.

2407
02:18:41.381 --> 02:18:44.470
That's one of the all time classic things.
Amazing Chemo coming out.

2408
02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:47.590
Literally strapped to a big cross.
Yeah,

2409
02:18:47.591 --> 02:18:50.440
a giant wooden cross and then fought from there.

2410
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:54.730
Now tell me what happened with Ron.
Ron Van Cleef come to your office.
Show Ron.

2411
02:18:55.220 --> 02:18:56.053
There's chemo,

2412
02:18:57.860 --> 02:19:02.830
it's an actual cross and chemo was up beast back then too.
Holy Shit.

2413
02:19:02.831 --> 02:19:05.640
That was a big boy.
Yeah.
So tell me what,

2414
02:19:05.700 --> 02:19:10.300
so Ron comes in and he comes in,
um,
I forget where he was,
maybe Philadelphia.

2415
02:19:10.301 --> 02:19:11.800
I don't think he was based in New York.

2416
02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:16.540
And he brings in a couple of his acolytes.
Who are these two?

2417
02:19:16.900 --> 02:19:21.730
How would you describe them there?
I'm very white looking guys

2418
02:19:23.740 --> 02:19:27.700
like Abercrombie and Fitch kind of models.
[inaudible]

2419
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:32.380
<v 4>Kinda twink ish.
I'm not saying that.
Okay.
I'm saying they're going to get it.</v>

2420
02:19:32.510 --> 02:19:35.480
They're kind of cut and they're built,
but they don't look like fighters.
Okay.

2421
02:19:35.481 --> 02:19:39.740
They look kind of guy.
I'm not saying that and uh,

2422
02:19:39.770 --> 02:19:42.460
but Abercrombie fee,
you know,
you can,
can you,
you know what that looks like?

2423
02:19:42.461 --> 02:19:46.790
So there with him and he comes in and he says,
and they're standing behind him.

2424
02:19:46.970 --> 02:19:49.630
He's sitting at the chair in front of my,
you know,

2425
02:19:49.640 --> 02:19:53.480
my desk and they're standing behind him with her arms crossed doing this,

2426
02:19:53.481 --> 02:19:57.650
you know,
where it [inaudible] right.
And he goes,

2427
02:19:57.651 --> 02:20:01.730
I like to enter the UFC.
And I go,
I,
you know,
Ron,
I don't know,
man it,
and they go,

2428
02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:06.460
oh,
it's like they're growling at me in this weird.
Really?
Yeah.
They grounded,

2429
02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:08.180
it wasn't a grouse in what she was like,
uh,

2430
02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:10.020
<v 0>oh,</v>

2431
02:20:10.150 --> 02:20:14.530
<v 4>watch your step.
Yeah,
exactly.
You know who you're talking to.
And um,</v>

2432
02:20:14.980 --> 02:20:18.460
he and Iran goes,
we talk,
and then they're growling and he goes,
he goes,

2433
02:20:18.461 --> 02:20:21.460
I'm in really great shape.
And he pulls up his shirt and he's ripped,
you know,

2434
02:20:21.461 --> 02:20:25.900
he's 50,
but he's really ripped.
Right.
He's shredded,
you know,
he goes,

2435
02:20:26.050 --> 02:20:29.920
come over here and punch me in the stomach.
And like one,
let me tell you,

2436
02:20:29.980 --> 02:20:32.440
I have no interest in punching him in the stomach.
It's just like,

2437
02:20:32.441 --> 02:20:36.820
not what I want to do.
I have no desire.
There's no part of my brain goes,

2438
02:20:36.940 --> 02:20:40.780
go punch him.
Nothing.
I don't want to touch him.
I don't want to go,
you know,

2439
02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:45.010
and uh,
there,
and he's holding his shirt up and the guy started going,

2440
02:20:45.250 --> 02:20:48.800
this is an insult to my sensei.
This is a need.
This our son,

2441
02:20:48.801 --> 02:20:50.290
Shari is insulted.

2442
02:20:50.740 --> 02:20:54.550
And I don't know if I was insulting them cause I wouldn't punch him or cause I

2443
02:20:54.551 --> 02:20:56.980
was considering punching him.
I couldn't really tell from that.

2444
02:20:57.250 --> 02:21:01.210
And then we all in rockets [inaudible] calms down and we're saying,

2445
02:21:01.720 --> 02:21:05.760
well what do I have to do to get into the UFC?
I go,
yeah man,
I don't know man.

2446
02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:09.190
We're going a little bit of hot water here with the cock fighting thing and I

2447
02:21:09.191 --> 02:21:12.190
want to put your 50 year old Kochan and this is not gonna work out for me.

2448
02:21:12.191 --> 02:21:15.160
And I just don't,
I don't see any good coming from this.
And he goes,
well,

2449
02:21:15.161 --> 02:21:17.920
I'm going to run the marathon.
I said,
well,
if you can do that,

2450
02:21:17.950 --> 02:21:18.761
maybe you come back.

2451
02:21:18.761 --> 02:21:23.110
And when I said come back like the man behind the curtain in the wizard of Oz,

2452
02:21:23.111 --> 02:21:24.310
you know,
the great and powerful.

2453
02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:29.050
Then the guy started in again with [inaudible] say,
you know,

2454
02:21:29.051 --> 02:21:33.280
and I wanted that point to go,
fuck are you and what are you guys doing here?

2455
02:21:33.310 --> 02:21:36.790
What are you the three stooges?
And he's,
you know,
Mo,
I didn't,
you know,

2456
02:21:36.791 --> 02:21:39.160
I didn't get the dynamic and,

2457
02:21:39.190 --> 02:21:43.030
but then he agreed to run the marathon in two hours and 49 million or whatever

2458
02:21:43.031 --> 02:21:46.960
the time was.
It was like a real time and the name.
Oh.

2459
02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:51.340
Then they want it to take their shirts off.
And that's what I found very bizarre.

2460
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:54.550
Like I'm the only one in my office with a shirt on.

2461
02:21:54.700 --> 02:21:57.460
So they took their shirts off as well.
Shirts came off.

2462
02:21:57.461 --> 02:22:01.210
So Ron van Cleef has his shirt off this two A's more holding it up.

2463
02:22:01.750 --> 02:22:05.950
So he's holding his shirt up.
The errors are Fitch guys take their shirts off.

2464
02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:08.860
Why did they take their shirts off?
I,
you know,
I don't know.

2465
02:22:08.890 --> 02:22:11.380
Maybe they thought I was,
some fucking was going to go down.

2466
02:22:11.381 --> 02:22:14.980
I don't know if that's how they roll.
Pull the shades down and we're all done.

2467
02:22:15.510 --> 02:22:17.940
You know,
I should've taken my shirt off.
He should have those.
Yeah.

2468
02:22:18.430 --> 02:22:22.330
Maybe by taking your pants off.
Yeah,
exactly.
Just fucking cut to the chase.

2469
02:22:22.331 --> 02:22:26.310
What are we trying to do dude?
What's up with this?
So,
um,

2470
02:22:26.460 --> 02:22:29.610
what happened after that?
He did,
he did the marathon,
he did the marathon,

2471
02:22:29.611 --> 02:22:32.700
he came back and you know,
we put him in and you know,
he was a,

2472
02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:36.240
he was a decorated veteran from Vietnam.
Right.

2473
02:22:36.420 --> 02:22:39.520
And he was a legend in the black martial arts world,

2474
02:22:39.521 --> 02:22:42.150
the African American martial arts world and the white martial arts world.

2475
02:22:42.151 --> 02:22:45.330
He was a legend.
He was very well known.
Yeah.
He was definitely well known,

2476
02:22:45.331 --> 02:22:49.530
but he was a,
he was revered in the African American,
you know,

2477
02:22:49.600 --> 02:22:53.340
a martial arts world.
And uh,
so that was good.
You know,

2478
02:22:53.341 --> 02:22:56.570
we were always trying to broaden the audience and we,
you know,

2479
02:22:56.670 --> 02:22:59.890
look pretty white at some points in the UFC history.

2480
02:22:59.890 --> 02:23:04.410
So it was nice to have him represent Bruce Lee there.
He is a guy,

2481
02:23:04.590 --> 02:23:08.910
you know,
at least sparred,
fought with Bruce Lee.
That's kind of cool.

2482
02:23:09.420 --> 02:23:12.750
Yeah,
no,
it's very cool.
Well he's,
the guy had mad balls,
you know,

2483
02:23:12.751 --> 02:23:15.840
he's still competes to this city.
Did have mad balls.
I,
you know,

2484
02:23:15.841 --> 02:23:18.360
it's like 50 years old and you come into the UFC,

2485
02:23:18.361 --> 02:23:21.720
he didn't know he was going to get voice.
He could've got chemo,

2486
02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:24.360
he could've got tank.
Yeah.
Oh Jesus.
You know what?

2487
02:23:24.361 --> 02:23:26.790
Actually I gotta to say this cause I'm making fun of him.

2488
02:23:26.791 --> 02:23:28.320
So I want to tell the other side of this.

2489
02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:33.240
So we made him the commissioner and there was a point,
it must've been,

2490
02:23:33.410 --> 02:23:38.410
he was fighting and four maybe it was five or six and tank.

2491
02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:41.760
We were in Wyoming tanks backstage,

2492
02:23:41.790 --> 02:23:45.990
like looking to pick a fight backstage,
you know,

2493
02:23:46.020 --> 02:23:48.150
who goes to a fight to pick a fight,
you know,

2494
02:23:48.151 --> 02:23:52.530
please walking around looking for a fight that yeah,
he,

2495
02:23:52.531 --> 02:23:57.030
because tank was,
you know,
tank was all mental,
you know,
everyone thinks,
you know,

2496
02:23:57.031 --> 02:24:01.530
he was just giant wide guy,
benched 600 wrestled at B B.

2497
02:24:01.570 --> 02:24:04.320
Why you buy it with those guys?
You know,
he was a tough,
tough guy,

2498
02:24:04.321 --> 02:24:08.220
but he was mental fucked with everyone from the moment he showed up.

2499
02:24:08.400 --> 02:24:12.070
She's walking around and I said to the state trooper,
I go,
can you kind of,

2500
02:24:12.390 --> 02:24:15.780
cause we had state troopers doing security backstage and they're in their full

2501
02:24:15.781 --> 02:24:17.340
on state trooper gear.
Right.
You know,

2502
02:24:17.341 --> 02:24:21.060
with the boots and the hat and a smokey thing.
And uh,

2503
02:24:21.090 --> 02:24:22.680
the state trooper looks at me.
He goes,
sir,

2504
02:24:23.310 --> 02:24:25.470
the only thing I could do to that man would be to shoot him.

2505
02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:31.500
Don't shoot him.
That's it.
That's it.
So anyway,
uh,

2506
02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:36.860
tank was acting up and Ron van Cleef went over and kind of button hold him and

2507
02:24:38.341 --> 02:24:42.330
said,
I don't know what he said.
Said he said,
settle the fuck down,

2508
02:24:42.331 --> 02:24:46.380
son and tank did.
And I don't know why.

2509
02:24:46.560 --> 02:24:47.580
Cause you know,

2510
02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:52.640
Ron was a chin high to tank and probably tank outweighed him by 150 pounds.

2511
02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:58.890
Tank was embarrassed,
you know,
just maybe she was just being silly and drunk.

2512
02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:03.460
Maybe.
Was tank fighting or was he,
was he just partied partying?

2513
02:25:03.660 --> 02:25:08.220
Uh,
I think it was the one before we introduced him.

2514
02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:12.570
Oh,
well that makes sense.
Yeah.
So he was back there like making himself,
well,

2515
02:25:12.571 --> 02:25:16.620
tank was a very interesting,
uh,
chapter in MMA,
in my opinion,

2516
02:25:16.621 --> 02:25:21.450
an important chapter.
And she was the Ronda Rousey of,
uh,
of our day.
You know,

2517
02:25:21.870 --> 02:25:26.500
I wouldn't say that I would,
he's very,
very different.
I'd say tank Abbott.

2518
02:25:26.830 --> 02:25:28.930
I wouldn't ever say he was a Rhonda Rousey or anything.
I mean,

2519
02:25:28.931 --> 02:25:30.850
he didn't have the credentials that Rhonda has.

2520
02:25:30.851 --> 02:25:34.660
He wasn't as skillful or a champion.
He was,

2521
02:25:34.661 --> 02:25:39.160
was a guy who could talk mad shit and he would fight anybody.

2522
02:25:39.460 --> 02:25:42.970
He was fighting,
fight anybody.
You can call tank Abbott the night before.

2523
02:25:42.971 --> 02:25:46.330
He could be out drinking and it could be Sunday morning and he was fighting

2524
02:25:46.331 --> 02:25:48.850
someone when called,
he is currently fighting,
you know,

2525
02:25:48.851 --> 02:25:51.700
tank stop fighting him and come fight.
This is the real deal.
I mean,

2526
02:25:51.701 --> 02:25:54.160
it wasn't just a character in a movie.
He really was.

2527
02:25:54.161 --> 02:25:58.990
That guy did like Ron van Cleef.
He would step up,
here's why.
He was like,

2528
02:25:59.010 --> 02:26:02.740
Rhonda,
you're exactly right.
You're 100% right.
You're always right.

2529
02:26:03.340 --> 02:26:06.070
Here's the different,
here's the different cases.
Fuck that.

2530
02:26:08.270 --> 02:26:10.990
That's a little late in the game for tank though,
isn't it?

2531
02:26:10.991 --> 02:26:14.940
That was UFC tank wasn't even UFC tank.
He was never lean.

2532
02:26:15.100 --> 02:26:16.960
Not Eliminating is just a powerhouse.

2533
02:26:17.350 --> 02:26:22.350
But tank brought an excitement and a new fan into the sport the way Rhonda has.

2534
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:27.370
And I think it was an important development for the UFC to have,
you know,

2535
02:26:27.760 --> 02:26:32.530
an all American bad guy,
a guy that represented the every man,

2536
02:26:32.710 --> 02:26:36.730
you know,
the Yahoo Ism,
you know,
and he was a pretty skilled fighter,
you know,

2537
02:26:36.731 --> 02:26:39.190
he did have skills and he was toughest,
couldn't be tougher.

2538
02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:43.840
And so I think he really opened it up beyond the geeky world,
you know,

2539
02:26:43.980 --> 02:26:48.980
the martial arts world and gave us a bunch of fans that weren't martial arts

2540
02:26:49.091 --> 02:26:51.190
fans.
Right.
I see what you're saying.
You know,
and yeah,

2541
02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:52.630
there's very important staff.

2542
02:26:52.660 --> 02:26:54.770
There was certainly something in and he also knew how to,

2543
02:26:54.780 --> 02:26:58.540
and he was a media favorite,
you know,
here right before he gets into the cage.

2544
02:26:59.290 --> 02:27:00.350
Is that silver behind,

2545
02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:04.330
can't see is that before he goes into the octagon he's having a beard.

2546
02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:07.180
Might be after.
I think it's,
I think that's during,

2547
02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:10.780
it might be before he's fucking crazy.
Yeah.
Yes.
Uh,

2548
02:27:10.810 --> 02:27:15.040
but he uh,
he had some serious fucking power though.

2549
02:27:15.370 --> 02:27:20.110
That's one thing tanks had.
He was massive knock guys dead by punching power.

2550
02:27:20.111 --> 02:27:24.580
He know what a punch he could knock guys dead and with those gloves and while he

2551
02:27:24.581 --> 02:27:28.060
was on one of the first guys to wear them,
I think he was the first,
was he,

2552
02:27:28.330 --> 02:27:33.330
it was either him or no art Jimmerson war the one of course,

2553
02:27:34.001 --> 02:27:35.890
right?
Yeah,
I think it was,
I think you're right.

2554
02:27:35.891 --> 02:27:40.720
I think tank was the first guy and then a veto or came around and warm for his

2555
02:27:40.721 --> 02:27:45.520
debut as well.
And that what but Vito was 12,
12.

2556
02:27:45.521 --> 02:27:50.140
Yeah.
And tank was six.
Somewhere around there.
Right?
Yeah.

2557
02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:52.900
Tank versus now.
Mark.
Steve,
no,
mark.
To this day,

2558
02:27:52.901 --> 02:27:56.530
one of the greatest Kaos and the history of the sport,
one of the most brutal.

2559
02:27:57.070 --> 02:27:58.480
And then John Matula,

2560
02:27:58.510 --> 02:28:02.770
the first one on another unbelievable Kao.
You know,

2561
02:28:02.771 --> 02:28:06.540
John [inaudible] is who wrote a apocalypse now wrote,

2562
02:28:06.700 --> 02:28:09.940
I love the smell of napalm in the morning,
right?
Wrote the dirty Harry movies,

2563
02:28:09.941 --> 02:28:12.310
directed the cone in the movies.
Uh,
and you know,

2564
02:28:12.311 --> 02:28:15.520
it was really a creative force in the early days of the UFC.
He goes,

2565
02:28:15.521 --> 02:28:19.240
you can't let the big guys lose.
And you know,

2566
02:28:19.241 --> 02:28:22.010
it's hard to tell John Milless he's wrong.
You know,
I didn't want to tell

2567
02:28:22.010 --> 02:28:22.491
<v 3>me is wrong,</v>

2568
02:28:22.491 --> 02:28:27.491
but he was wrong because I think when Manny Arbor or lost twin Matua lost when

2569
02:28:28.131 --> 02:28:32.180
Paul Vera Lynn's,
you know,
the,
the polar bear windows big guys lose.
It's real.

2570
02:28:32.181 --> 02:28:33.014
It's amazing.

2571
02:28:33.400 --> 02:28:37.510
<v 2>Yeah.
Everybody's got to lose,
man.
That's,
that's the thing.
It's like,</v>

2572
02:28:37.570 --> 02:28:40.450
and also guys who you don't think you're gonna lose,
have to lose.

2573
02:28:40.480 --> 02:28:44.800
That's still a wild watching tank.
Right?
That clinic that's like tank row.

2574
02:28:44.830 --> 02:28:48.100
Thank you.
Throw some fucking leather.
A Dude could bang and he find anybody.

2575
02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:49.720
I really respected that,

2576
02:28:49.721 --> 02:28:53.350
that he would just fight anybody at the drop of a hat if I Pedro his own Brazil,

2577
02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:58.300
you know,
as you say,
will fight anyone.
Yeah.
And it had a lot of fun fights.

2578
02:28:58.390 --> 02:29:03.390
He had a lot of fun fights inside the octagon and then came back and fought in

2579
02:29:03.641 --> 02:29:07.840
the UFC back in the early two thousands when the UFC was a struggling tank.

2580
02:29:07.841 --> 02:29:10.690
Abbott was one of their,
uh,
things that they introduced,

2581
02:29:10.691 --> 02:29:12.880
like Dana White introduced him into the octagon,

2582
02:29:13.210 --> 02:29:16.810
brought him in there and start talking shit again and he's a great mistake.
Yeah.

2583
02:29:17.030 --> 02:29:18.880
You know,
he had the act down.
It was good.
Yeah.

2584
02:29:18.881 --> 02:29:22.240
And he had a whole bunch of guys that he would,
uh,
you know,
Eddie Sanchez,

2585
02:29:22.241 --> 02:29:24.290
a bunch of guys who trained with man.
It was tough.

2586
02:29:24.790 --> 02:29:27.250
We used to say there was like the three stooges on the dangerous.

2587
02:29:28.980 --> 02:29:30.540
They were dangerous.
They were like,
uh,

2588
02:29:30.730 --> 02:29:35.110
it was like a small riot following tank through the,
you know,
and I guess

2589
02:29:37.870 --> 02:29:38.640
there was none of that.

2590
02:29:38.640 --> 02:29:40.980
<v 3>You know,
I did like when tank took the pin,</v>

2591
02:29:41.020 --> 02:29:46.020
there was posters of Ken shamrock and tank found big vaginas from penthouse for

2592
02:29:46.831 --> 02:29:51.750
any glued the vagina's very carefully over Ken speedos and then hung those up.

2593
02:29:51.751 --> 02:29:53.670
But uh,
that's a nice touch.

2594
02:29:54.940 --> 02:29:59.170
<v 2>Yeah.
Look at that.
That's mature,
right?
No,
I don't think this one's meant to us.</v>

2595
02:29:59.200 --> 02:30:03.280
I think that's Paul Violins.
It's hard to tell who's he got down there.

2596
02:30:03.281 --> 02:30:05.650
It's hard to tell who he's fighting.
But tank did that,

2597
02:30:05.680 --> 02:30:09.010
he did that to Steven Elmore now marquee knocked out.
Oh,

2598
02:30:09.011 --> 02:30:13.160
that's all I tech tar off.
That was a great guy.
Oh,
like,
and then,
yeah,

2599
02:30:13.250 --> 02:30:16.210
you could hit that guy with a brick.
I don't think it did anything.
Yeah.

2600
02:30:16.211 --> 02:30:19.480
And all like again,
well,
hens on knocked him out with a fucking upkick.

2601
02:30:19.540 --> 02:30:22.750
Remember that?
That was in like the world combat league.

2602
02:30:22.930 --> 02:30:25.060
I think he was trying to throw somebody out of the octagon once.

2603
02:30:25.120 --> 02:30:29.560
That wasn't Bella Tori.
No,
he was,
uh,
he,
he uh,

2604
02:30:29.620 --> 02:30:32.830
he knocked him out with an upkick.
It might've been in Brazil,

2605
02:30:32.890 --> 02:30:35.920
I forget where it was,
but old leg was standing over him.

2606
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:40.630
And Henzel up kicked him and k Odom and old like fell back and he was out cold

2607
02:30:40.631 --> 02:30:42.400
and then hands off followed it up with the right hand.

2608
02:30:42.550 --> 02:30:45.250
But he was already out cold.
He was alcohol from the UPC.
Keck.

2609
02:30:45.640 --> 02:30:47.740
That's another thing that I think if I could change anything,

2610
02:30:47.741 --> 02:30:51.670
I would allow the guy on the bottom to,
to a strike on the ground,

2611
02:30:51.850 --> 02:30:53.260
like to kick to the face on the ground.

2612
02:30:53.410 --> 02:30:57.310
Even if the guy's on his knees and you should be able to knee and kick a guy in

2613
02:30:57.311 --> 02:30:59.470
the face on the ground.
Cause you can't kick a guy.

2614
02:30:59.480 --> 02:31:03.250
You can't up kick a guy if a guy has one knee down.
I think that's ridiculous.

2615
02:31:03.460 --> 02:31:05.800
I think if you're on your back,
the guy should be able to kick you.

2616
02:31:06.300 --> 02:31:07.990
I mean if you're on your back,

2617
02:31:07.991 --> 02:31:11.740
you should be able to kick the guy in the face period.
If a guy's on his knee,

2618
02:31:11.741 --> 02:31:13.840
if the guys at anywhere,
you know the guy is,

2619
02:31:13.841 --> 02:31:15.460
if he's above you and you're on your back,

2620
02:31:15.461 --> 02:31:18.550
you should be able to kick him in the face.
The fact that you can't,
it's silly.

2621
02:31:18.930 --> 02:31:19.680
The,
um,

2622
02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:23.250
the only reason why I think you shouldn't be able to kick a guy on the ground is

2623
02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:26.640
soccer kicks if a guy's head is near the cage,

2624
02:31:26.940 --> 02:31:29.440
because if you're near the cage and your head is pinned up,

2625
02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:33.150
you're going to stomp you are soccer kick you and you can't get out of the way.

2626
02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:36.900
But one of the interesting things about pride was the stomps into the soccer

2627
02:31:36.901 --> 02:31:39.660
kicks.
I mean,
that was,
that was an interesting aspect of it.

2628
02:31:40.140 --> 02:31:42.990
Those were effective techniques.
It's hard to say that,
you know,

2629
02:31:43.380 --> 02:31:47.670
it's hard to say that those are any more or less brutal than regular head kicks

2630
02:31:47.830 --> 02:31:52.500
there.
Basically.
It's the same.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.

2631
02:31:52.501 --> 02:31:57.150
But I tell you what I do know is with pride,
you know,
in early days UFC,

2632
02:31:57.480 --> 02:32:01.770
the visualness was very important that people saw it was very different.

2633
02:32:02.100 --> 02:32:06.090
I'm not sure that's as important now with the UFC.
You in fact,

2634
02:32:06.660 --> 02:32:11.400
you almost want it to be like something you recognize when you turn it on.

2635
02:32:12.030 --> 02:32:14.130
It's not that people want to predictability,

2636
02:32:14.340 --> 02:32:18.180
but I think they want to feel like they might be able to understand the matchups

2637
02:32:18.181 --> 02:32:20.670
enough to pick who's going to win.
You know?

2638
02:32:20.671 --> 02:32:25.671
And I think the more outrageous techniques add to that outrageous visual appeal.

2639
02:32:29.100 --> 02:32:33.930
And you know,
I'm not sure that's,
it's not,
you know,
Joe,

2640
02:32:34.950 --> 02:32:39.630
is it right to say you think is close to a real fight is what it should be.
Yes.

2641
02:32:40.200 --> 02:32:41.850
Yeah.
As close to a real fight as you can get,

2642
02:32:42.030 --> 02:32:44.610
which is why I don't like stand ups and I know people say,

2643
02:32:44.611 --> 02:32:47.700
well was going to make it boring and it killed the sport.
I don't believe that.

2644
02:32:47.790 --> 02:32:48.361
I don't believe that.

2645
02:32:48.361 --> 02:32:51.480
I think you're gonna have more guys like Hanan Barao more guys that you can't

2646
02:32:51.481 --> 02:32:53.420
take down.
And if you do take them down,

2647
02:32:53.490 --> 02:32:55.320
you know they're gonna fucking submit you.
You know,

2648
02:32:55.380 --> 02:32:58.510
Charles Olivera in his last fight caught a guy with a,

2649
02:32:58.511 --> 02:33:03.180
a belief it's a triangle off of his back in the same sort of situation.

2650
02:33:03.181 --> 02:33:06.630
That guy was trying to hold them down,
trying to,
guy was trying to beat him.

2651
02:33:06.810 --> 02:33:07.770
Guy took him down,

2652
02:33:07.890 --> 02:33:11.340
held onto him and his guard and he got submitted and that's how it should be a

2653
02:33:11.341 --> 02:33:15.810
guy.
If you'd take a guy down,
that guy had better get good at one or two things,

2654
02:33:15.840 --> 02:33:18.070
either you better get good at submitting guys or better get,

2655
02:33:18.080 --> 02:33:22.200
get good at getting back up to his feet or sweeping one of the other.

2656
02:33:22.470 --> 02:33:24.690
You have to get good at those things.
If you're not good at those things,

2657
02:33:24.691 --> 02:33:29.160
well then guys should take you down and they should hold you down and that's

2658
02:33:29.161 --> 02:33:32.810
real.
If as soon as you like instigate these standups,
you're,

2659
02:33:32.811 --> 02:33:35.790
you're putting something into a,
you initiate a stand up,

2660
02:33:35.970 --> 02:33:39.150
you're putting something into a fight that's not natural.
I don't,

2661
02:33:39.151 --> 02:33:40.260
I don't like standups.

2662
02:33:40.440 --> 02:33:45.240
I don't like guys who use time on the ground to recoup.

2663
02:33:45.840 --> 02:33:49.840
I don't either.
But if you can,
why not?
No,
no,
that's exactly right.
Well,

2664
02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:53.310
look at what happened with the best guys are not going to do that again.

2665
02:33:53.311 --> 02:33:56.880
I hate to use these two guys in example,
but you don't see that with Josie Aldo.

2666
02:33:56.881 --> 02:33:59.220
You don't see Josie all,
they'll take guys down and hold on to them.

2667
02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:02.610
You don't see Hanan Barao take guys down and hold on to them and just take
their,

2668
02:34:02.611 --> 02:34:06.530
catch their breath.
GSP do it a little bit.
He did it.
He definitely did it.
No,

2669
02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.250
and I love GSPs the greatest.

2670
02:34:08.251 --> 02:34:12.690
I think GSP is a very intelligent fighter and part of being a very intelligent

2671
02:34:12.691 --> 02:34:15.810
fighters.
You fight saves what you can.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2672
02:34:15.870 --> 02:34:19.390
You could criticize him for that.
You like,
and I understand it,
I get it.

2673
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:23.380
But it took a guy like Johnny Hendricks who was trying to murder GSP to,

2674
02:34:23.410 --> 02:34:26.770
you know,
to drag d GSP into the deepest water that he's ever been in,

2675
02:34:26.771 --> 02:34:29.470
in his career,
in,
in as a champion to master.

2676
02:34:29.990 --> 02:34:33.370
It should be those duck dynasty guys.
That's not right.
Wrapped it.

2677
02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:36.710
Fucking get a good handle on that.
Just give them a beaten.
Um,

2678
02:34:36.770 --> 02:34:39.580
but with your teeth,
well you can't grab hair.
So I would guess,
no.

2679
02:34:40.090 --> 02:34:41.860
I guess if a guy,
he have a big,

2680
02:34:41.890 --> 02:34:44.350
nobody has had one of those beers came into the octagon.

2681
02:34:44.890 --> 02:34:48.310
They've had a decent one was,
I think it was patting some of the punches.

2682
02:34:48.311 --> 02:34:52.600
It was like,
Ah,
who says that?
People do say that?
Like it was nothing.

2683
02:34:53.380 --> 02:34:56.480
It's ridiculous.
That's the thing in boxing though,
right?
You're supposed to,

2684
02:34:56.750 --> 02:34:59.530
it was more so that your skin wouldn't cut.
Was that what it was?

2685
02:34:59.590 --> 02:35:02.890
I think that's what that is.
I don't think anyone thinks.
What about Alex Caceres?

2686
02:35:02.891 --> 02:35:05.710
He has this gigantic huge Afro.
I mean,

2687
02:35:05.740 --> 02:35:10.510
should that be able to protect him against,
uh,
against head kicks?
I mean,
is that,

2688
02:35:10.540 --> 02:35:14.920
is that cushioning,
that giant Afro?
It's bad ass.
If I had that kind of hair,

2689
02:35:14.921 --> 02:35:18.910
I'd wear an Afro because Sarah's absolutely.
Yeah,
I mean,

2690
02:35:18.911 --> 02:35:20.890
I think there's a few rules that could be changed.

2691
02:35:20.891 --> 02:35:23.060
I think a big one for me is the 12 six elbow.

2692
02:35:23.090 --> 02:35:26.140
I think that's a ridiculous rule to get to the purity of fighting.

2693
02:35:26.160 --> 02:35:29.080
As soon as that's your mantra.
That's what I'm talking about.

2694
02:35:29.290 --> 02:35:33.460
And that's a shorter version than I,
he got to be.
I just remember it gets bigger.

2695
02:35:33.461 --> 02:35:35.290
He's got a bigger one now.
That's a,

2696
02:35:35.291 --> 02:35:38.800
he had a huge victory recently over Sergio Pettis.
Did you see that?
No,
I did not.

2697
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:43.540
Great.
Great fucking fight.
Ooh,
very exciting.
So much new talent.

2698
02:35:43.570 --> 02:35:48.370
You have seen so many fights and you're still,
you love everyone.
Oh,
no question.

2699
02:35:48.760 --> 02:35:52.270
You're unbelievable.
Well,
I'm just fortunate that I'm a real fan,
you know,

2700
02:35:52.271 --> 02:35:55.160
it's not like a job for me.
I know.
I mean it certainly is a job for me.

2701
02:35:55.190 --> 02:35:57.500
I take it very serious and professional.
Like people always say like,

2702
02:35:57.501 --> 02:35:58.930
Oh do you do the UFC stone?

2703
02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:01.330
Like that's a big question that I get all the time cause I do a lot of things

2704
02:36:01.331 --> 02:36:04.330
high obviously.
Um,
why is that?
I've never,

2705
02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:09.070
I tell people I'm never,
I don't never,
don't do it at all.

2706
02:36:09.071 --> 02:36:12.340
Don't think about doing it.
It's not necessary.
It's not,

2707
02:36:12.341 --> 02:36:17.330
it wouldn't be helpful to you.
Hi.
Cause me on it.
No.
If that was you.
Hi.

2708
02:36:17.840 --> 02:36:22.630
Are the real problems and I'd have to,
yeah,
I would,
I would really have problems.

2709
02:36:22.720 --> 02:36:26.890
Like marijuana turned out to be a very good medicinal drug for me just for life.

2710
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:28.150
You know,
people say like,
what do you,

2711
02:36:28.151 --> 02:36:31.480
what do you take medical marijuana for life.
I need it for life.

2712
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:33.730
I got a condition.
The condition is called the real world.

2713
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:38.350
It's called camp though.
You know,
real life life is fucking crazy.
But my,

2714
02:36:38.410 --> 02:36:42.040
my fortune in being,
working for the UFC is a,

2715
02:36:42.041 --> 02:36:44.590
I don't have to pretend to like it.
I don't pretend like this.

2716
02:36:44.591 --> 02:36:46.030
There's guys who cover basketball.

2717
02:36:46.031 --> 02:36:48.550
They don't give a flying fuck about basketball.
You see it.

2718
02:36:48.551 --> 02:36:51.790
I don't want it to be sports guys.
I never wanted to be a sports guy.

2719
02:36:51.791 --> 02:36:56.791
So Dana in pushing me and you guys in hiring me first and then Dana and pushing

2720
02:36:58.061 --> 02:37:02.350
me to become a commentator made me do it.
You know,
if it wasn't for that,

2721
02:37:02.351 --> 02:37:05.830
I would have just probably be talking about at the same way.
I just wouldn't,

2722
02:37:06.100 --> 02:37:10.990
I remember you at 11 your eyes were like this big gay were,
you were,

2723
02:37:10.991 --> 02:37:15.830
so you were,
you were a kid at Christmas.
You really were,
was 12 yeah,
UFC 12 yeah.

2724
02:37:16.780 --> 02:37:21.350
Yeah.
I was,
I was a law.
No,
but it was 1997 Dothan,
Alabama.

2725
02:37:21.560 --> 02:37:26.210
Yeah.
Doesn't the peanut capital of the world.
I certainly,
uh,

2726
02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:27.380
had a great fucking time.

2727
02:37:27.890 --> 02:37:31.400
But I think that what the difference in today is there's,

2728
02:37:31.401 --> 02:37:34.430
there's a bunch of differences and the difference in today is that what you're

2729
02:37:34.431 --> 02:37:38.500
seeing and when you watch these guys fight is true.
Worldclass absolutely.

2730
02:37:38.720 --> 02:37:43.100
That's what's been the most amazing thing is watching that transition from MMA

2731
02:37:43.101 --> 02:37:47.630
fighters that some of them were elite,
like Vito was elite even at 19.

2732
02:37:47.860 --> 02:37:51.820
And when Vito or fought Scott for Ozo and trade telecom and trade telling man

2733
02:37:51.830 --> 02:37:54.380
first of all,
that that was the first time we ever got to see him.

2734
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:57.500
I had seen him before because I was training at Vituro school with Vito was

2735
02:37:57.501 --> 02:37:58.640
training across some Gracie's.

2736
02:37:58.790 --> 02:38:02.750
So I got to see him train there and I also got to see his first fight with John

2737
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:07.640
Hess,
which was in,
um,
in Hawaii and eve.
Oh,
looked up John Hess.
I mean,

2738
02:38:07.641 --> 02:38:09.830
just lit him up like a Christmas tree.

2739
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:14.510
So I knew what kind of speed and power he had at a striking,
but that was,

2740
02:38:14.750 --> 02:38:18.220
he was one of the first real true world class athletes.
How crazy.

2741
02:38:19.340 --> 02:38:23.300
Yes.
I think Ken shamrock.
Oh yes.

2742
02:38:23.510 --> 02:38:28.310
Ken shamrock was a really tough guy.
More than tough guy.
Football player.

2743
02:38:28.340 --> 02:38:31.340
Very accomplished athletes.
Pat Smith,

2744
02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:36.820
good kickboxer Vito Rodeo.
Vito was on another level.
If Vittorio was,

2745
02:38:36.830 --> 02:38:41.650
I know,
I know,
I know,
but you know it's not exactly right that there,

2746
02:38:42.230 --> 02:38:45.260
there,
there were some guys in the beginning,
you know,
I mean,

2747
02:38:45.261 --> 02:38:47.930
Gordo was a professional fighter.
I mean,
you know,

2748
02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:51.920
he would do okay in kickboxing today,
but he would not know.
I don't think so.

2749
02:38:51.950 --> 02:38:54.650
He would do okay.
You would do okay but not like v tour.

2750
02:38:54.830 --> 02:38:57.590
Vito was the first guy that to me had that,

2751
02:38:57.740 --> 02:39:02.740
that real elite athlete ability like pull up v tour versus um,

2752
02:39:04.730 --> 02:39:08.450
Trey telling them trays,
Tra telling man,
um,

2753
02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:13.460
v toward to me was the first guy that showed like modern martial arts skills.

2754
02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:17.420
Like if you watched what he did there,
you could see a guy do that in this UFC.

2755
02:39:17.420 --> 02:39:18.253
I know it's hard to,

2756
02:39:18.380 --> 02:39:22.400
it's hard to argue that because it has a physical specimen freak.
Well,

2757
02:39:22.401 --> 02:39:25.880
it's weird is he's just as good now.
He must have been.

2758
02:39:26.240 --> 02:39:30.760
How old was he when teams,
yeah,
he was 19 I think I met him before he was Nike.

2759
02:39:30.780 --> 02:39:34.670
I think he just turned 18 when I met him.
Not when he fought,
when he fought.

2760
02:39:34.671 --> 02:39:39.200
He was 19 when he fought in the UFC rather he was 19 baby.
Yeah,

2761
02:39:39.230 --> 02:39:40.520
look at him.
That's a,

2762
02:39:40.521 --> 02:39:44.630
that's the first v tour and everybody knew him as a Jujitsu black belt.

2763
02:39:44.810 --> 02:39:47.810
That's what everybody means.
Great.
Using the name Victor Gracie.

2764
02:39:47.980 --> 02:39:51.130
It was victor too is the VI K Tor.

2765
02:39:51.290 --> 02:39:53.810
They spelled it differently and then they went with v tour after that.

2766
02:39:53.811 --> 02:39:56.210
Like when I was interviewing him and talking backstage,

2767
02:39:56.420 --> 02:39:59.930
I even called him Victor Gracie at one point in time,
like inadvertently,

2768
02:40:00.020 --> 02:40:03.260
but they were all in the middle of something with Horian were Horian was keeping

2769
02:40:03.261 --> 02:40:06.080
him from using the Gracie name and uh,
they,

2770
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:09.350
they also changed it from Victor To v tour and I don't know why they were

2771
02:40:09.351 --> 02:40:10.640
calling him victor in the first place.

2772
02:40:10.970 --> 02:40:12.890
I don't know if they were trying to Americanize him or what,

2773
02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:18.000
but no one knew what to expect from Vituro.
Vidor is less American.

2774
02:40:18.570 --> 02:40:21.720
Yes,
it was.
What,
say Victor,
why they were calling him victor?

2775
02:40:21.870 --> 02:40:25.770
I think they were trying to Americanize it,
but Vic victor at the time,

2776
02:40:25.771 --> 02:40:27.660
which we used to all call him,
uh,

2777
02:40:27.661 --> 02:40:32.250
he came out like this and no one knew that he was this elite Stryker.

2778
02:40:32.430 --> 02:40:37.170
I mean he just unloads on trade telling man and he was fast.
Oh,

2779
02:40:37.171 --> 02:40:40.920
he's fast.
And he was a great grappler and everybody expected this.

2780
02:40:40.921 --> 02:40:42.540
They expected a take down attempt,

2781
02:40:42.720 --> 02:40:47.010
but he clinched with them and instigated these insane striking fucking

2782
02:40:47.011 --> 02:40:49.950
exchanges.
Joe Fifth Years.
So flash forward 15 years,

2783
02:40:50.130 --> 02:40:54.090
I don't think who Vidor I don't think he's had the career he should have had.

2784
02:40:54.890 --> 02:40:55.800
Um,
maybe,

2785
02:40:56.370 --> 02:40:59.700
maybe he went through some tough times and you've got to give him a little bit

2786
02:40:59.701 --> 02:41:03.900
of slack because of what happened to his sister.
Horrific,
horrific story.

2787
02:41:03.901 --> 02:41:07.540
She was murdered,
raped,
and murdered.
And it's just horrifying.
And then the,

2788
02:41:07.541 --> 02:41:10.440
there was the breakup,
the split up between him and crossing Gracie.

2789
02:41:10.441 --> 02:41:14.340
He went through some periods of his life where he had some serious issues and

2790
02:41:14.341 --> 02:41:17.070
was,
was losing and fights in Japan.

2791
02:41:17.071 --> 02:41:20.370
You know that you just didn't look like this guy when he fought.

2792
02:41:20.371 --> 02:41:22.440
Sakharova just never looked like this guy.

2793
02:41:23.760 --> 02:41:27.720
Randy coture stole a little bit of its soul.
That's,
that's a fact.

2794
02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:31.060
Randy coture when he beat v or the first time he took a little bit of

2795
02:41:31.061 --> 02:41:36.060
[inaudible] soul that was,
uh,
back when Vituro was young and wild and very young.

2796
02:41:36.390 --> 02:41:39.510
He had all these good things going for him,
but he couldn't deal with that.

2797
02:41:39.511 --> 02:41:42.930
Captain America pressure.
I'm forgetting.
I'm on your show again.
I'm like,

2798
02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:44.430
tell me more about it.
Let's talk more about,

2799
02:41:44.500 --> 02:41:46.890
I want to hear more about Randy events cause he's rack.

2800
02:41:46.890 --> 02:41:51.890
Randy was a very experienced fighter and a great athlete and he knew how to win.

2801
02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:54.420
That's the thing about those wrestlers is they know how to win.

2802
02:41:54.450 --> 02:41:56.910
They know how to suck it up and they know how to suck it up.

2803
02:41:57.150 --> 02:41:59.940
They know how to deal with adversity because they dealt with it every day in the

2804
02:41:59.941 --> 02:42:01.930
training room.
Get the ears.
Yeah.
The d,

2805
02:42:01.970 --> 02:42:06.270
the amount of diversity you have to deal with to be an elite amateur wrestler is

2806
02:42:06.271 --> 02:42:09.510
unparalleled in the world of sports because it's not just hard training.

2807
02:42:09.660 --> 02:42:13.890
It's hard training where you're going to war with other men on a daily basis

2808
02:42:13.891 --> 02:42:18.630
with every fucking ounce of your energy in every,
every last drop manifests.

2809
02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:21.870
It's about men,
a big part of it and you know,

2810
02:42:21.871 --> 02:42:26.550
you almost couldn't do boxing that much and you can't do on the mat now you

2811
02:42:26.551 --> 02:42:30.450
can't because you get fucking brain damage of the hospital.
Yeah,
yeah.

2812
02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:34.200
If you boxed all day,
just constantly boxed all day,

2813
02:42:34.201 --> 02:42:37.140
just got your fucking head rattled in all day saying what you jets,

2814
02:42:37.141 --> 02:42:39.060
you can do that.
Exactly.
Well,

2815
02:42:39.061 --> 02:42:42.060
that's one of the things that I really love about Jujitsu is that you can do it

2816
02:42:42.270 --> 02:42:45.510
and you can train hard and still not get injured.

2817
02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:49.500
The real problem with Jujitsu is just the wear and tear on the body over years

2818
02:42:49.501 --> 02:42:52.050
and years of doing it.
If you do like an hour and a half,

2819
02:42:52.051 --> 02:42:57.010
two hours of like hard you do to everyday things is blow out.
Right.

2820
02:42:57.150 --> 02:42:58.060
Exactly.
Well,

2821
02:42:58.080 --> 02:43:02.880
you can a little bit and you get better at rolling lightly and technically,

2822
02:43:02.881 --> 02:43:07.740
but bad shit still happens to the best guys I know.
The elite of the elite,

2823
02:43:07.800 --> 02:43:11.690
they blow their knees out,
they twist their ankles,
they hurt their,
you know,

2824
02:43:11.710 --> 02:43:16.420
you make me love the UFC more and I never didn't love it.

2825
02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:20.890
No.
You,
uh,
that was one of the cool things about you being,
you know,
at the helm.

2826
02:43:20.920 --> 02:43:23.830
I think Meyrowitz was more of a guy who was in it for the business of it.

2827
02:43:23.980 --> 02:43:26.590
Maybe enjoyed it while it was happening to the first one.

2828
02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:30.220
First one was it bull shit.

2829
02:43:30.310 --> 02:43:33.130
They probably thought it was going to fucking go crazy.
People are going to die.

2830
02:43:33.131 --> 02:43:37.210
There's veto versus John Hess.
This is Vito at like,
look at that.

2831
02:43:37.660 --> 02:43:40.240
Look at fun.
She played that from the beginning.

2832
02:43:40.450 --> 02:43:44.990
And John Hassell was a guy who poked guys in the eye and shit.
He,
uh,

2833
02:43:45.010 --> 02:43:48.850
he had,
uh,
uh,
uh,
I forget.
And the,

2834
02:43:48.851 --> 02:43:50.170
I forget the dude's name that he fought.

2835
02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:52.660
Isn't there a beginning of this video just says that.
Oh,

2836
02:43:52.661 --> 02:43:56.860
it just has that dude that is fucking ridiculous.

2837
02:43:56.890 --> 02:44:01.540
He had some serious hand speed and still does.
That's what's great.

2838
02:44:01.690 --> 02:44:04.390
I mean,
this looks really good.
Well,

2839
02:44:04.420 --> 02:44:08.620
he's the next guy fighting for the title 36.
Yeah.

2840
02:44:08.740 --> 02:44:12.500
Something along those lines.
Yeah.
He's fighting for the fucking title.

2841
02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:13.353
He's going to fight.

2842
02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:17.650
He's going to fight Chris Weidman [inaudible] Vegas in Vegas,

2843
02:44:17.651 --> 02:44:21.220
and it becomes a real issue because of testosterone replacement.

2844
02:44:21.520 --> 02:44:24.790
He has an exemption that he uses for testosterone replacement.

2845
02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:29.800
Wait a minute back that up lacks aliens.
Oh,
okay.
That's Henry host the,

2846
02:44:29.801 --> 02:44:32.980
uh,
that's,
that guy's done.
Ray Lewis is down there training with them.
Henry,

2847
02:44:32.981 --> 02:44:36.650
who has done a tremendous job with their,
their striking and he's a,
uh,

2848
02:44:36.940 --> 02:44:39.040
he's certainly a part of the resurgence of,

2849
02:44:39.041 --> 02:44:41.680
of veto or along with that whole Blackzilians camp.

2850
02:44:41.681 --> 02:44:44.640
But the real issue is testosterone replacement,
you know,

2851
02:44:44.650 --> 02:44:48.790
veto or uses testosterone.
And he has a doctor's exemption in Brazil,

2852
02:44:48.940 --> 02:44:52.310
but he can't get one in Vegas and or neither can I be,

2853
02:44:52.311 --> 02:44:55.720
if you just want to go on record,
they won't give me the fee and can't get one.

2854
02:44:55.730 --> 02:44:59.140
And He,
maybe he can get one in Vegas,
but I'm saying is it's being,

2855
02:44:59.230 --> 02:45:01.600
it's not just automatically being offered up to them.

2856
02:45:01.990 --> 02:45:06.190
And one of the reasons for that is that he tested positive for steroids in the

2857
02:45:06.191 --> 02:45:06.521
past.

2858
02:45:06.521 --> 02:45:10.120
And that's the big argument is that if you did test positive for steroids in the

2859
02:45:10.121 --> 02:45:11.560
past and they can prove that,

2860
02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:14.110
then you shouldn't be able to get testosterone because the reason why your

2861
02:45:14.111 --> 02:45:16.540
testosterone is low in the first place is because you cheated.

2862
02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:21.880
So it gets real weird method does,
it gets real weird,
but the results,

2863
02:45:22.210 --> 02:45:22.960
Holy Shit.

2864
02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:27.070
Who's a better fucking poster boy for Testosterone Replacement Than v tour?

2865
02:45:27.280 --> 02:45:29.410
Because at 37 no,

2866
02:45:29.620 --> 02:45:34.620
not even close at 37 or 36 years of age vittores still worldclass whereas Ken,

2867
02:45:35.351 --> 02:45:38.800
I'm an admirer,
Ken Shamrock,
he's a great fighter and had some great,

2868
02:45:39.010 --> 02:45:42.080
really underrated fights in pride.
You know?
You know what?

2869
02:45:42.100 --> 02:45:45.100
That's a great point because he had some very tough fights in pride.

2870
02:45:45.110 --> 02:45:48.250
He's a tough fighter.
He's a tough bastard and he is a tough,

2871
02:45:48.340 --> 02:45:51.430
been around a long time and he had really good leg locks too back in the day

2872
02:45:51.431 --> 02:45:55.390
when no one knew and nobody liked lock was when he fought in the UFC and he'll

2873
02:45:55.391 --> 02:45:57.490
hooked his first guy and ripped his fucking nia part.

2874
02:45:57.610 --> 02:46:02.470
Who was that guy that he uh,
he,
he'll hooked.
And one of the first UFC,
he's,
oh,

2875
02:46:02.471 --> 02:46:06.100
was it a well,
the kickbox that you were talking about earlier,
Pat Smith,

2876
02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:09.320
didn't he heal?
Look Pat Smith and fuck his knee up.
I believe he did.

2877
02:46:09.500 --> 02:46:13.910
Ken shamrock versus Cat Smith's so much about this deal hooked him and ripped

2878
02:46:13.911 --> 02:46:17.180
his knee apart.
I remember Pat Smith screaming like,

2879
02:46:17.330 --> 02:46:21.710
Ken shamrock just tears fucking me up.
Absolutely.
I can now.
Now I see pat going,

2880
02:46:21.870 --> 02:46:25.430
I remember him going,
yeah.
You know,
he couldn't tap fast.

2881
02:46:25.431 --> 02:46:29.030
10 shamrock Pat Smith can take what was a great,
we'll end with this.
Yeah.

2882
02:46:29.060 --> 02:46:33.350
Ken was,
Ken's very underrated,
very underrated.
But you know,

2883
02:46:33.351 --> 02:46:37.510
he's a guy who we rapping.
We're three hours in,
but we did three hours already.

2893
02:47:06.151 --> 02:47:08.190
what do you want me to do?
I don't know if I can talk.

2894
02:47:08.490 --> 02:47:13.260
I mean it might not be able to contractually do it.
Yeah.
Hmm.

2895

okay,
we'll see if he does.

2896

I asked him to give me all this money.

but I'll definitely watch it.
I'm going to set my DVR.

2900

I'd love to and uh,
I wish you luck.
I mean,
you're a great guy.

2901
02:47:34.230 --> 02:47:38.010
If it wasn't for you,
I would've never worked for the UFC.
So I think it is true.

2902
02:47:38.040 --> 02:47:40.380
It is man.
You're the door.
The UFC has benefit.

2903
02:47:40.410 --> 02:47:44.490
You're the door that got me in and uh,
from there it's a,
it's been a lot of fun.

2904
02:47:44.491 --> 02:47:46.630
So,
uh,
I thank you you,
uh,

2905
02:47:46.980 --> 02:47:50.040
and I thank you for almost getting me a fight with Wesley snipes.

2906
02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:52.290
That was kind of fun too.
It was fun.

2907
02:47:52.310 --> 02:47:54.680
It made me realize how hard it is to train to fight that.

2908
02:47:54.690 --> 02:47:58.320
That was a life changing three months.
Cool.

2909
02:47:58.380 --> 02:48:01.230
Made me exhausted every day of falling asleep,

2910
02:48:01.530 --> 02:48:04.650
sitting in front of the TV conking out every night.
It was so fucking tired.

2911
02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:09.210
Just training twice a day.
Just on Howard.
Cause you went on a long time ago.

2912
02:48:09.370 --> 02:48:11.670
<v 3>No,
no,
no.
When you,
when you were talking about the fight,
what,</v>

2913
02:48:11.700 --> 02:48:14.670
where were we in the process at that point where you're tired of waiting on me

2914
02:48:14.671 --> 02:48:18.300
to get Wesley to agree or I don't think that was on Howard Stern.
Yeah,
no,

2915
02:48:18.301 --> 02:48:21.460
that's where it first came out.
You went on Howard and talked about it.
Really?

2916
02:48:21.480 --> 02:48:23.370
Yeah.
Cause Jeff,
your manager calls me,

2917
02:48:23.371 --> 02:48:26.050
I think gave me a heads up that he's talking about it.

2918
02:48:27.390 --> 02:48:32.370
<v 2>I don't remember.
That seems wrong though.
Trying to figure that out.</v>

2919
02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:37.170
Um,
I don't know.
I don't remember.
There's a long time ago,
but um,

2920
02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:39.720
how many years ago was that?
Like 2007 or something like that.

2921
02:48:39.780 --> 02:48:40.820
When did the last night of Bingo

2922
02:48:40.920 --> 02:48:45.120
<v 3>for that?
Cause I was just before I did the iron ring.
Yeah,
it's about that time.</v>

2923
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:46.950
2006,
2007.

2924
02:48:47.050 --> 02:48:51.640
<v 2>Yeah.
Um,
that was,
uh,
yeah.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Cool.
Would that have been,</v>

2925
02:48:51.970 --> 02:48:54.610
it would have been cool for what had been very cool as long as it took,

2926
02:48:55.840 --> 02:48:59.680
as long as it took,
it would have been interesting.
I,
I don't not like that guy.

2927
02:48:59.690 --> 02:49:01.960
Just want everybody to know I'm a,
I'm a big fan of that guy.
No,

2928
02:49:02.020 --> 02:49:04.480
you never had a grudge against blade.
Just thought it was cool.

2929
02:49:04.510 --> 02:49:07.410
He's a great actor.
He's a cool actor.
He's been in a lot of cool moves.

2930
02:49:07.411 --> 02:49:11.660
Here's Ken shamrock
and that's it.
Yeah.
And Pat Smith,

2931
02:49:12.050 --> 02:49:13.410
Pat Smith tried to kick him.

2932
02:49:14.020 --> 02:49:17.480
He tried to kick them on the ground and Ken got ahold of that.
He'll,

2933
02:49:17.960 --> 02:49:19.820
pat didn't know how to escape.
That was not even an,

2934
02:49:19.970 --> 02:49:22.370
that's there's some space in there too.
These days.

2935
02:49:22.371 --> 02:49:26.270
Guys would step over with that left leg and spin out of it or try to push on the

2936
02:49:26.271 --> 02:49:27.320
bus and try to get their foot out.

2937
02:49:27.440 --> 02:49:29.690
But Pat didn't know what he's doing on his back or,
yeah,

2938
02:49:29.691 --> 02:49:34.670
he's trying to elbow and screaming and just,
his knees was ripped apart.

2939
02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:39.500
Look and pass land there.
And Ken,
Ken's man dog,
and I'm now,

2940
02:49:40.940 --> 02:49:42.230
the guy's screaming.

2941
02:49:42.500 --> 02:49:46.550
That shit hurts so bad because when with a a heel hook,

2942
02:49:46.580 --> 02:49:49.100
your meniscus just gets ripped apart.

2943
02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:51.770
It just gets snapped and crackled and popped.

2944
02:49:52.130 --> 02:49:56.570
It's a terrible feeling to pat was the first African American,
uh,
Rodeo champion.

2945
02:49:56.810 --> 02:50:01.310
Was He really a really good athlete or Rodeo champion?
Did he ride bulls?

2946
02:50:01.311 --> 02:50:03.290
Are your horses or would he ride the fuck?

2947
02:50:03.291 --> 02:50:07.640
Do I know [inaudible] something with legs?
I don't know.

2948
02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:10.810
I didn't know about the,
I know less about the Rodeo than I do about,

2949
02:50:10.850 --> 02:50:14.350
I don't know.
You gotta be a tough fuck Rodeo trained to be a black cowboys.
