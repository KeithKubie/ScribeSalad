00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.670
Tattoos are visual reminders of ourselves
in a place and time.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:08.540
They're living artwork and carry a lot of
memories, but sometimes YOU JUST DON'T WANT

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:19.599
HER NAME ON YOUR ARM ANYMORE.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.420
Tattooing is thousands of years old.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.539
The oldest known in-tact human body, the Ã–tzi
ice man has tattoos -- and he's over 5000

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:27.580
years old.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.210
Tattoos have a dark history, literally.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.210
Dark.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.330
Because they used to only come in one color,
black, and they were used for spiritual or

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.110
healing purposes, to show status, or for fashion.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.739
They've been done with sharpened rocks, sticks,
metal tools and other implements, anything

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.809
to get the ink into the skin.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.700
The tattoo machine we know today was invented
in the late-1800s and was based on Thomas

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.310
Edison's automatic engraving machine; it uses
a solid needle to inject ink into the skin

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:53.260
from 50 to 3000 times a minute.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.820
The machine injects a drop of insoluble ink
under the top layer of skin, the epidermis,

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.942
and into the more stable dermis -- about 1
millimeter into the skin.

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.630
The ink molecules cannot be digested by macrophage
immune cells.

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.980
Instead, the cells consume the ink and then
adopt that pigment and just hang out... which

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.690
is why tats don't break down too much over
time.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.460
That being said, 45 million Americans have
tattoos, and according to the American Society

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.790
for Dermatological Surgery, 100,000 people
got tattoo REMOVAL in 2011 -- up 20% from

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:23.900
the previous year.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.220
Tattoo removal is a huge industry, because
of how tattoos work.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.350
The most well-known way to remove a tattoo
is laser removal, which uses specialized laser

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.500
light to degrade the ink molecules.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.040
Each laser treatment requires six or more
weeks of healing, and each COLOR in the tattoo

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.550
requires different laser-light wavelength
to break it down.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.610
Neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminum-garnet or
alexandrite lasers work for blue and black

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.380
inks, for example, but less well for reds.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.760
There are over 1000 inks on the market, and
the dermatologists doing the removal rarely

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.330
know which were used.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.710
Once the treatment breaks them down, the body's
macrophages can eat up the, now smaller, broken

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.710
inky bits.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.780
Laser removal is sort of like a pencil eraser.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.810
The darker and thicker it is, the harder it
is to erase, and the more sessions it can

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.810
take.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.670
Not to mention, if the wrong wavelength of
laser is used, permanent scarring can occur.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.250
Other methods include dermabrasion, which
is essentially scouring or sanding off the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.140
tattoo with a high-speed brush or diamond
fraise wheel.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.050
Both the epidermis and the dermis are removed,
resulting in the destruction of the tattoo.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.440
It sounds savage, but it's commonly used to
remove other types of scarring and skin damage.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.200
The worst way is to simply surgically remove
the piece of skin containing the tattoo.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.300
Now though, a fourth way might be on the horizon.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.050
Alec Falkenham, a researcher in Halifax, Canada
is working on a simple topical cream.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.870
The cream is put onto the tattoo and reportedly
causes no abrasions, blisters or inflammation,

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.590
mainly because it doesn't actually target
the tattoo itself, but those macrophages!

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.400
The cream causes NEW macrophages to come in
and consume the pigmented hangy-outy macrophages;

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.530
spiriting them away to the lymph nodes to
be tossed out!

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.120
Over time, the tattoo is naturally eaten away.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.990
It's not quite ready for public use, they're
currently testing the cream on pigs ears.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.370
In the end, the Mayo Clinic warns that tattoos
are permanent.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:27.370
YES lasers, dermabrasion, surgery and maybe
this cream -- but overall, they're permanent!

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.530
Our friends at buzzfeed make awesome videos.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.819
Sure they love cats and gifs, but they love
science too!

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.170
Here's a video they did about DIY teeth whitening

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.170
So make sure you check out that video!
