Okay already!

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.720

From J.K. Rowling, the author of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.640
the book series that kept Borders
open for another few years.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.080
VOICE (CONT'D)
Comes the movie adaptation for

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.720
people too lazy to read.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.060
VOICE (CONT'D)
Harry Potter.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.350
VOICE (CONT'D)
When an evil noseless freak

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.400
threatens to take over the world -
it's up to this boy wizard, his

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.580
totally useless friend and his
superior in every way, hot lady

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.949
friend... to defeat him.

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:39.280
VOICE (CONT'D)
And when I said hot, I only meant

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.269
in the last three movies after she
turned 18. Pervs.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.519
VOICE (CONT'D)
Journey along as they travel to a

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:48.019
magical boarding school where kids
learn potions, spells and

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.479
divination... but not English, Math
or Science.

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:52.769
VOICE (CONT'D)
Where technology seems to be frozen

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.780
in the 19th century, replacing cell
phones and the internet, with quill

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:57.769
pens and owls.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.390
VOICE (CONT'D)
And where child endangerment is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.239
totally no big deal.

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:13.689
VOICE (CONT'D)
My goodness!

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.420
VOICE (CONT'D)
Seriously how have they not shut

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.450
this school down yet?

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.659
VOICE (CONT'D)
A franchise so epic, it took ten

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.649
years, eight films, four directors
and two Dumbledores to tell...

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:33.070
Featuring...

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.240
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one that started it all

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.399
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one everyone hates

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.359
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one everyone loves

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:40.619
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one with shovel face.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.109
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one with the raging hormones

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.079
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one where Dumbledore dies

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:46.130
Oh uh, spoiler alert.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.890
VOICE (CONT'D)
The one you can skip

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.119
VOICE (CONT'D)
And the one that made adults cry

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.319
like little babies

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.579
VOICE (CONT'D)
Follow our heroes as they transform

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:56.630
from adorable youngsters struggling
to act

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.109

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.460
VOICE (CONT'D)
To young adults pretending to look

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.920
like grownups.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:08.210
VOICE (CONT'D)
Ron really let himself go.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.460

VOICE (CONT'D)
Witness the magic that will dazzle

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.230
you with questions like:

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.870
If magic is supposed to be secret,
why is their doorway in the most

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.230
highly trafficed subway station in
London?

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.069
Why are all the bullies in one
house

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:25.340
VOICE (CONT'D)
and why don't they just expel them?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.250
VOICE (CONT'D)
And isn't it disturbing that this

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.760
rat on Ron's crotch is actually a
grown man? Ehhugh..

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.430

VOICE (CONT'D)
Battles that would have been way

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.909
cooler with lightsabers... or if
they just moved around a little

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:53.159

So quidditch makes absolutely no sense right? A 150 point ball?
