00:00:00.958 --> 00:00:02.136
Voiceover:We've got a triangle here where

00:00:02.136 --> 00:00:04.844
we know two of the angles
and one of the sides.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.420
And what I claim, is that I
can figure out everything else

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.359
about this triangle just
with this information.

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:12.107
You give me two angles and a side,

00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:13.719
and I can figure out what the other

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:14.972
two sides are going to be.

00:00:14.972 --> 00:00:17.120
And I can, of course,
figure out the third angle.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.031
So, let's try to figure that out.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:20.742
And the way that we're going to do it,

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:23.236
we're going to use something
called the Law of Sines.

00:00:23.236 --> 00:00:26.776
In a future video, I will
prove the Law of Sines.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:29.095
But here, I am just going to show you how

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:30.617
we can actually apply it.

00:00:30.617 --> 00:00:32.395
And it's a fairly straightforward idea.

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:33.665
The Law of Sines just tells us

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:37.280
that the ratio between
the sine of an angle,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.174
and the side opposite to it,

00:00:39.174 --> 00:00:42.607
is going to be constant for any
of the angles in a triangle.

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:45.405
So for example, for this
triangle right over here.

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:46.674
This is a 30 degree angle,

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:48.729
This is a 45 degree angle.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:50.132
They have to add up to 180.

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:54.037
So this right over here
has to be a, let's see,

00:00:54.314 --> 00:00:59.872
it's going to be 180 minus 45 minus 30.

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:04.677
That's 180 minus 75, so
this is going to equal

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:07.701
105 degree angle, right over here.

00:01:08.839 --> 00:01:10.522
And so applying the Law of Sines,

00:01:10.522 --> 00:01:12.261
actually let me label the different sides.

00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:14.535
Let's call this side right over here,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.770
side A or has length A.

00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:26.816
And let's call this side,
right over here, has length B.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.758
So the Law of Sines tells us

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:31.195
that the ratio between
the sine of an angle,

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:33.266
and that the opposite side is going to be

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.639
constant through this triangle.

00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:41.806
So it tells us that sine of
this angle, sine of 30 degrees

00:01:41.806 --> 00:01:44.735
over the length of the side opposite,

00:01:44.735 --> 00:01:50.695
is going to be equal to
sine of a 105 degrees,

00:01:53.587 --> 00:01:56.628
over the length of the
side opposite to it.

00:01:56.982 --> 00:02:02.019
Which is going to be equal
to sine of 45 degrees.

00:02:04.726 --> 00:02:08.126
equal to the length of the side opposite.

00:02:08.218 --> 00:02:10.658
So sine of 45 degrees over B.

00:02:10.858 --> 00:02:12.988
And so if we wanted to figure out A,

00:02:12.988 --> 00:02:16.166
we could solve this
equation right over here.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.816
And if we wanted to solve for B,

00:02:17.816 --> 00:02:19.802
we could just set this equal
to that right over there.

00:02:19.802 --> 00:02:21.553
So let's solve each of these.

00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:24.110
So what is the sine of 30 degrees?

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.855
Well, you might just remember
it from your unit circles

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:28.795
or from even 30, 60, 90
triangles and that's 1/2.

00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:30.265
And if you don't remember it,

00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:32.725
you can use a calculator to verify that.

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:33.742
I have already verified that

00:02:33.742 --> 00:02:36.924
this is in degree mode, so it's 0.5.

00:02:36.924 --> 00:02:42.220
So this is going to be
equal to 1/2 over two.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.195
So another way of thinking about it,

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:45.882
that's going to be equal to 1/4,

00:02:45.882 --> 00:02:47.626
this piece is equal to 1/4

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:53.413
is equal to sine of a 105 degrees over A.

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:55.184
Let me write this, this is equal to

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.990
sine of 105 degrees over A.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.769
And actually, we could also say,

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.299
since we could actually
do both at the same time,

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.358
that this is equal to that.

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:14.888
That 1/4 is equal to sine
of 45 degrees over B.

00:03:14.888 --> 00:03:18.300
Actually, sine of 45 degrees
is another one of those

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.544
that is easy to jump out of unit circles.

00:03:20.544 --> 00:03:23.168
You might remember it's
square of two over two.

00:03:23.168 --> 00:03:27.973
Let's just write, that's
square root of two over two.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:28.928
And you can use a calculator,

00:03:28.928 --> 00:03:31.229
but you'll get some decimal
value right over there.

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.645
But either case, in
either of these equations,

00:03:32.645 --> 00:03:34.320
let's solve for A then let's solve for B.

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:35.833
So one thing we could do is we could

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:38.872
take the reciprocal of both
sides of this equation.

00:03:38.872 --> 00:03:41.203
The reciprocal of 1/4 is four.

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:43.881
And the reciprocal of this right-hand side

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:49.243
is A over the sine of 105 degrees.

00:03:49.243 --> 00:03:50.785
And then to solve for A,
we could just multiply

00:03:50.785 --> 00:03:54.790
both sides times the
sine of a 105 degrees.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:03.764
So we get four times the sine
of 105 degrees is equal to A.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:05.411
Let's get our calculator out,

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:11.372
so four times the sine of 105 gives us,

00:04:11.372 --> 00:04:14.182
it's approximately equal to,

00:04:14.182 --> 00:04:18.034
let's just round to the
nearest 100th, 3.86.

00:04:18.434 --> 00:04:22.630
So A is approximately equal to 3.86.

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:27.610
Which looks about right if this is two,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.376
and I have made my angles appropriately,

00:04:29.376 --> 00:04:31.535
that looks like about 3.86.

00:04:31.535 --> 00:04:33.191
Let's figure out what B is.

00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:34.629
We could once again take the reciprocal of

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.122
both sides of this and we get

00:04:37.122 --> 00:04:44.831
four is equal to B over
square root of two over two,

00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:46.639
we could multiply both sides times

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.448
square root of two over two.

00:04:48.448 --> 00:04:51.379
And we would get B is equal to

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:55.354
four times the square
root of two over two.

00:04:57.892 --> 00:04:59.923
Come to think of it, B is four times

00:04:59.923 --> 00:05:02.109
the sine of 45 degrees.

00:05:02.755 --> 00:05:04.344
Let's figure out what that is.

00:05:04.344 --> 00:05:05.900
If we wanted actual numerical value,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.267
we could just write this
as two square roots of two.

00:05:08.267 --> 00:05:09.492
But let's actually
figure out what that is.

00:05:09.492 --> 00:05:15.599
Two square roots of two is equal to 2.83.

00:05:15.876 --> 00:05:20.870
So B is approximately equal to 2.83.

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.822
So [I'm] be clear, this
four divided by two is

00:05:23.822 --> 00:05:27.179
two square roots of two, which is 2.8.

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:31.509
Which is approximately equal to 2.83

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:34.112
if we round to the nearest 100th, 2.83,

00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:36.653
which also seems pretty reasonable here.

00:05:36.653 --> 00:05:40.750
So the key of the Law of Cosines is

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:44.722
if you have two angles and a side,

00:05:44.722 --> 00:05:46.596
you're able to figure out
everything else about it.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:52.286
Or if you actually had
two sides and an angle,

00:05:52.286 --> 00:05:54.250
you also would be able to figure out

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.412
everything else about the triangle.
