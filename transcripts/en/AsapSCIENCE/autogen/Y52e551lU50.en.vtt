00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.000
 With more than 1.8 billion cans of soft drinks sold daily, and nearly 48% of Americans 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.690
 Drink at least a glass of soda water a day. Easy to say that many of us like 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.359
 Sugary drinks. But what happens to our bodies and minds if we drink soda water only? 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.580
 When the drink enters your mouth, high acidity in it leads to enamel erosion in the teeth, 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.689
 The microorganisms in your teeth begin to feed on sugar 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.310
 Leading to decay. When the box is finished, you have consumed more than 46 grams of sugar. 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.460
 The receptors on your tongue feel this and send a message to the cortex of your brain 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.940
 "I want more," he says. A week later 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.050
 By drinking 8 glasses of water recommended by cola you will have 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:52.920
 Consumed more than 5432 extra calories. This is one of the biggest associated health problems 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.239
 Drink soft drinks is: overweight. 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.879
 â…• Weight gain is estimated in the United States between 1977-2007 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.810
 Attributable to soft drinks. In addition, Yale researchers found that when people drink 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.000
 Soft drinks, they also consume more calories, and because they simply do not calculate exactly 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.430
 Calories added to their drinks. Moreover, corn syrup is high fructose 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.250
 It is the primary local in soft drinks not digested in our bodies the same way 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.119
 Other sugars are digested. Increases the fat of the liver, thereby increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.759
 Insulin hormones and leptin are not active. These hormones are the body that feel 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.360
 And prevents excessive eating. Infection with insulin also increases the risk of infection 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.049
 Diabetes. Overall, studies suggest that reducing the amount of sugar in the beverage may 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.670
 Prevents one million excess obesity 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.640
 So, should we switch to diet drinks? Surprisingly, there is still a link between 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.790
 Industrial sweeteners and obesity also. Tests found that the sweet taste 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.149
 Whether it is real sugar or artificial sweeteners, increases appetite, not to mention 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.670
 That many dieters allow themselves to eat more with their knowledge that they have been reduced 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.729
 Calories saying, "Since I drink soda diet, I can take big fried potatoes with burgers" 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.060
 But soft drinks can make us thirsty. The cellulite is a protective covering on the ends of our chromosomes 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.580
 Which shorten with time. It turned out that the rate of its shortness at 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.870
 A person who takes 600 ml of soda a day is the same person as a smoker 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.830
 So what would happen if I drank two liters of soda a day? Well a woman has done it for over 16 years 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.650
 Until the hospital was admitted at age 31. Although her family history is free of heart disease 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.540
 She suffered from palpitations and fainting spells, and tests showed that she had severe deficiency 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.410
 In potassium, where fructose and caffeine cause loss of potassium with urine 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.800
 And diarrhea. Luckily our bodies have a wonderful ability to recover, once they have stopped drinking 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.920
 Potassium levels returned to normal levels and most of the symptoms began to disappear 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.040
