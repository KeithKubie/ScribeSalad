00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.975
If you're looking for f inverse of f of x, then in the place of x in the

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:10.511
function 10 to the x, we need to plug in log base 10 of x. That's going to give

00:00:10.511 --> 00:00:15.650
us 10 to the power of log base 10 of x. We know that since these are inverses,

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.550
that will just equal x. Putting this in the exponent undoes what the log did to

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.519
x.
