&gt;&gt;Jim: You need to go
to www.sparknotes.com.

00:00:14.706 --> 00:00:17.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Jim Wilson, an English
teacher for thirty three years,

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:20.126
is a self proclaimed old dog,
trying to learn new tricks.

00:00:20.626 --> 00:00:23.746
&gt;&gt;Jim: When I first came to
this classroom nine years ago,

00:00:23.746 --> 00:00:26.366
there was a computer
here, and I actually had

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:27.896
to be taught how to turn it on.

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.856
That's where I've come from.

00:00:31.486 --> 00:00:34.086
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Here in Freedom,
Pennsylvania, an old railroad town

00:00:34.086 --> 00:00:37.836
on the Ohio River, Freedom Area High
School is two years into a quest

00:00:37.956 --> 00:00:42.356
to go high tech, and Mr. Wilson is
on a crash course in modern teacher.

00:00:42.596 --> 00:00:44.566
&gt;&gt;Jim: I'm looking for you
to get the pictures in.

00:00:44.566 --> 00:00:46.156
I'm looking for you
to get the music in.

00:00:46.156 --> 00:00:46.786
I'm looking for you--

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:50.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, his sophomores
are making PowerPoint presentations

00:00:50.956 --> 00:00:53.126
on the history and culture
behind Charles Dickens'

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.386
"A Tale of Two Cities."

00:00:55.006 --> 00:00:57.816
&gt;&gt;Ben: In the beginning of the year,
we had a lot of typing projects,

00:00:57.816 --> 00:01:00.476
you know, like writing
stories, stuff like that.

00:01:00.576 --> 00:01:03.546
Throughout the course of the year,
we've kinda expanded to PowerPoints

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:07.026
and video presentations
and stuff like that.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:09.446
It's actually gotten really fun.

00:01:09.446 --> 00:01:13.716
&gt;&gt;Jim: My main fears were, I think,
the same fears as every old person.

00:01:13.796 --> 00:01:18.246
First of all, I fear change a little
bit because I did it so many years,

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:21.066
you know, and I was so
comfortable with what I was doing.

00:01:21.066 --> 00:01:23.976
And the second fear I still
think is a legitimate fear,

00:01:23.976 --> 00:01:28.476
in that I'm heading into an arena
where the students know more

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:30.246
than I do and that's a scary thing.

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:36.526
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Slowly but surely,
Mister Wilson is overcoming his fear.

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:39.796
&gt;&gt;Jim: All right, don't panic,
don't panic, don't panic, do this.

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.816
&gt;&gt;It's absolutely changed
the way I teach.

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:46.956
I think I've given up some of
the control and become more

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:53.916
of a facilitator, as opposed to,
"This is the way you write the paper.

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:56.116
This is what you have to do."

00:01:56.116 --> 00:02:00.386
I think I've become more of somebody
who will guide them through it,

00:02:00.386 --> 00:02:04.056
rather than grab them by the
neck and drag them through it.

00:02:04.486 --> 00:02:06.026
&gt;&gt;What do you want to look up?

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Or French
government, anything.

00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:11.306
&gt;&gt;Jim: It's the French
revolution, it's pretty friendly.

00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:12.696
What else do you want
me to do for you here?

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:14.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Conveniently, some

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:16.716
of his best tech support
comes from students.

00:02:17.706 --> 00:02:19.326
&gt;&gt;Student: No, no, no, don't
use that, it won't work.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:20.726
&gt;&gt;Jim: A lot of times,
I'll just say, "Hey,

00:02:20.726 --> 00:02:22.426
who in this class knows how to?"

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:24.676
And they'll go, "Oh, I'll
show you how to do this."

00:02:24.676 --> 00:02:25.596
&gt;&gt;Student: Like, we
need the Geek Squad.

00:02:26.256 --> 00:02:27.486
&gt;&gt;Student: Larry should
be on the Geek Squad.

00:02:27.486 --> 00:02:28.926
&gt;&gt;Student: You should
be on the Geek Squad.

00:02:29.396 --> 00:02:31.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The next step for Mister
Wilson is better lesson planning.

00:02:32.086 --> 00:02:34.466
&gt;&gt;Jim: I've had a lot of
assignments blow up in my face

00:02:34.556 --> 00:02:35.886
that I thought were gonna be good.

00:02:36.336 --> 00:02:39.006
&gt;&gt;Narrator: All with a little help
from tech integration coach, Tom.

00:02:39.396 --> 00:02:41.866
&gt;&gt;Tom: Now it's just a
matter of fine tuning...

00:02:43.096 --> 00:02:45.446
&gt;&gt;Jim: A couple of years from
now, I would like to first

00:02:45.446 --> 00:02:48.496
of all be competent enough and
competent is the correct word,

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:52.796
that I feel very comfortable walking
in, saying, "Here's the assignment."

00:02:53.396 --> 00:02:56.356
Because right now, you know,
sometimes I give the assignment

00:02:56.356 --> 00:02:58.356
and go, "Okay, what's going next?"

00:02:58.356 --> 00:02:58.866
you know.

00:02:58.956 --> 00:03:02.106
&gt;&gt;Now you're challenging me, and I
want you to know that--

00:03:02.106 --> 00:03:05.026
&gt;&gt;And the second thing I'd
like to be able to do is

00:03:05.026 --> 00:03:07.286
with confidence say,
"You need some help?

00:03:07.286 --> 00:03:08.446
Here, I can show you how to do that."

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:11.426
And in a couple of years, I
think I will be able to do that.

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:13.606
&gt;&gt;Student: That is such
a great idea, yeah.

00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:15.156
That works.

00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:15.826
&gt;&gt;Okay.

00:03:20.546 --> 00:03:22.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For more
