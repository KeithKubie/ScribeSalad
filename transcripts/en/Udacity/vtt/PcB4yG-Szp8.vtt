00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.860
A modern operating system is a complex piece of software and lots going on, some

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.510
of which may be completely outside the user's

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.320
control. For example, a network message comes in,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.630
and your anti virus software goes into

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.440
high gear checking for attacks. The normal behavior

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.220
of a good operating system should provide an

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.400
application with the resources is it asking for.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.930
For example, more memory or access to a file, and so on.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.760
And get out of the way, as quickly and quietly as possible.
