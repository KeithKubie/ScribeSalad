1
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:10,430
Oh, hi, I didn't see you there. Sorry.

2
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:13,550
I brought the Burt Reynolds
play real close up. Tim Ferriss,

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:18,551
we're going to show you an exercise
that is called cathedral and it is very

4
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:23,780
useful for handstand practice or any type
of inversion practice and engaging the

5
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:26,990
musculature. That will be very
important for anything more advanced.

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,040
There are different ways to practice
handstands and of course one of the

7
00:00:31,041 --> 00:00:33,080
limiting factors for a lot
of people is the risks.

8
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,880
The risks will get really grumpy,
the forums will get a really lit up,

9
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:38,840
the elbows would get really lit up.
So how do you practice more?

10
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:42,620
How do you add volume without
destroying these joints? Uh,

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:45,200
especially as a novice, there are
few ways you can go about doing it.

12
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:46,034
Some people will do,

13
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,480
they'll do posts like this where
they'll actually post on their forearms.

14
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,800
Other people will use something called
a feed up or a shoulder stand up,

15
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:57,440
basically looks like a padded toilet
seat and they stick their head through so

16
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:01,490
that they can place the weight on their
shoulders and then perform exercises.

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,380
But what if you don't have
any of this equipment? Well,

18
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,100
it turns out you can use a partner
for a very simple exercise,

19
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,570
relatively simple and there's
a progression. So Kipling,
my good friend here, uh,

20
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,830
at Kipling,
Kip,

21
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:17,240
l I n n on Instagram and everywhere else
is going to demonstrate what this looks

22
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:21,350
like and in effect I'm just supporting
her in a shoulder stand and I'll give

23
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:25,090
some commentary as we go through.
All right,

24
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,240
so
like,

25
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:32,810
so now as I place my hands
on basically taking the,

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,320
the palms and putting them to the point
where they feel like they're going to

27
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:37,040
slip,

28
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,570
but just before my hands
are very widely open,

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,890
like so.

30
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,950
And you'll elicit that Kipling's given
me a little bit of weight so that I can

31
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,280
make sure they're not going to totally
slip. I do have a little bit of chocolate,

32
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,740
my hands too. Okay. From here? Yeah,

33
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:57,030
she's putting her hands on my thighs
stepping up, my arms are straight.

34
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,870
I'm pushing a bit with the fingertips
and then she's going to do a progression

35
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,990
straddle

36
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:17,310
and then you can do any number
of different things. Okay.

37
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,660
So that would be from pipe position.
If she did a Tuck,

38
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,890
that'd be a little bit easier.

39
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,870
And then you can also do straddle work.

40
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:32,670
So there are many different ways to work
in this position to get more mileage

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,720
without totally destroying your joints.
If you're putting all of your weight.

42
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,590
And then you can do things like this,
which I can't do,

43
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,830
but sometimes flexi flyers
can get it done. Okay.

44
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,153
All right.

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And the way this translates that position
that we just did is you want to do

46
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:56,620
bird to shoulder,
stand to helicopter.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,830
So the way that translates as a base,

48
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:04,750
you're developing the skill
to do stuff like this.

49
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,230
Okay? So this is the
beginner's version. Uh,

50
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:17,230
and then if we wanted to do
the free standing version,

51
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,200
looks like that. And then you
can do all sorts of cool things.

52
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,710
Like we'd come up and rotate helicopter
and we can even go through it the second

53
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,054
time.

54
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,883
Like so

55
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,030
there you have it. If you enjoyed
that video, let's talk about a list.

56
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,810
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jamie Foxx,
undisputed King of Big Wave Surfing.

57
00:03:50,811 --> 00:03:53,900
Laird Hamilton. The list goes on
and on. What do they have in common?

58
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,530
They're sharing their secrets, their
morning routines, favorite books,

59
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:02,240
everything with me on my podcast, the Tim
Ferriss show, 70 million plus downloads,

60
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,020
iTunes, best of 2015 check it
