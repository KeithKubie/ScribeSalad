1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,910
It's not good. He might
be. That's our mat. I um,

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,570
I bumped into someone's car once and I
left a note with my phone number and my,

3
00:00:11,791 --> 00:00:14,760
uh, my address. Nice.
And, uh, not my address,

4
00:00:14,761 --> 00:00:17,670
my phone number and my name and um,

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,500
they called me up and they
just so happened to be very
good friends with someone

6
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:27,360
who else friends with.
So then he calls me up and he tells me,

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:32,190
dude, you hit my friend's car. And then he
tells me, then I go tell him to call me.

8
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:36,060
Man. It's cool. Yeah,
it was undetectable. I,

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:39,420
it wasn't bad, but it was
something. Yeah know it was like,

10
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:44,290
it was a little scuff on the bumper,
but it was my, it was, I was like, oh,

11
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:49,080
thank God I left a message. I felt
like such a piece of shit up my friend.

12
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:49,914
And he was like,

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,210
and some fucking asshole hit
my friend's car and took off.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,580
You believe that shit. I'm like, no.
Crazy Bro. That's, that's bullshit.

15
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:03,180
And now cameras have everybody doing
everything so you'll always get busted.

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,270
Yeah. When do you think it's going
to be where you have a Tesla,

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,820
you know with those things do when you
think it's going to be where no one's

18
00:01:08,821 --> 00:01:13,080
driving. How many, how many
more years? We're, well,

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,760
we're a lot of people aren't driving 20
I would say 20 to 30 you remember when

20
00:01:17,761 --> 00:01:19,570
Prius's were a joke?
Yeah.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,510
Someone had a preach to like get that
fucking stupid thing away from me. Yeah.

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,000
Or even the early Tesla.
The roadster. Like,

23
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,590
do you know that top gear you want to,
you know that British show top gear?

24
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,641
Here's what's crazy.

25
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:37,641
I found out they did an episode where
they pretended that the Tesla roadster

26
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,820
died on them while they were
driving around the track.

27
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,960
But it didn't really die on though.

28
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,910
That was just the storyline was that
they wanted it to die. So that's gross.

29
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:49,950
Apparently the way the show is made,

30
00:01:49,951 --> 00:01:54,090
it's like a comedy show and it's
scripted so they can get away with doing

31
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:54,924
something like that.

32
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,310
So Elon Musk's sued them
and I think he lost,

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,630
believe it or not, cause they
don't claim to be. Exactly.

34
00:02:03,631 --> 00:02:07,200
They don't claim to be factual and they
complained, they, they, they don't,

35
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,310
they don't claim to not have narratives.
They create.

36
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:16,160
So gross that up just to make
sure that I'm bad. Grossly gross.

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,950
It's amazing how many shots that
they take. Elon Musk called top gear,

38
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:23,190
completely phony and his company
sued for libel and malicious falls.

39
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,580
So it's a judge dismissed the suit in
October saying no view or the program

40
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,660
could have reasonably be compared the
roadsters performance on the track to real

41
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:34,410
world performance on the street. That
seems fuzzy. I don't know what that means.

42
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,090
Okay. What is um, 2012
that way? What is the case?

43
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,410
What did he said?

44
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,500
What Elon Musk said that was that they
faked it and they claim the power Tesla.

45
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,520
Okay, let's see what it says.
We could figure out, I think,

46
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:54,630
I'm pretty sure that's the story.
After tests dropped the car off,

47
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,480
Elon Musk claim that one of his
employees was along for the delivery.

48
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:00,640
Notice that a script for the episode
inside there was a segment about the Tesla

49
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,310
breaking down,
but that was only the tip of the iceberg.

50
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,090
Top gear claim that the Tesla roadster
ran out of power while driving after just

51
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,540
55 miles, much less than the
200 miles quoted by Tesla,

52
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:15,130
albeit it was being driven hard.
A claim that must said was untrue.

53
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:15,964
According to him,

54
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,800
the roadsters logs show that the car
had never dipped below 20% charge during

55
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,000
the entirety of the filming.

56
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,380
The clip followed with the
roadsters motor overheating,

57
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:28,720
which wasn't addressed by mosque.
And finally a break failure,

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,840
which must claims was instead a blown
fuse and not an equipment failure.

59
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,750
Battery powered electric cars
will soon die altogether.

60
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,310
Former topcare host James
Mason. Ah, interesting.

61
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,930
Isn't that amazing?
So there were some,

62
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,330
it sounds like there was
some horseshit for sure,

63
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,750
but it does sound like there was a real
break problem and the brake problem was

64
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,090
a blown fuse, which there's
nothing you can do about that,

65
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:55,930
but just that it's such a
strange thing that like, yeah,

66
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,080
you just have to attack electric
cars. Like it's just a, well,

67
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,110
I think the wem them making a script.

68
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:04,930
If they had a script that said that
the test was going to break down,

69
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,850
they thought it was be funny.
It's a comedy bit.

70
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,500
It's a comedy show with Jeremy Clarkson
was fucking hilarious. He's really funny.

71
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,590
But there is definitely all
the people that are, yeah.

72
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,110
You believe a lot of the stuff that they
say and the performance of the car. I,

73
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,190
you know,
I always thought it was funny,

74
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:26,050
but I also saw them as experts.
Well, they kind of are.

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,380
Yeah. I mean, uh, they
know a lot of shit. Yeah.

76
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,260
They know a lot of shit about
cars, for sure. Jeremy Clarkson,

77
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,250
he knows a lot about cars.

78
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,870
The problem is people go to them for
advice and lap times and all that shit.

79
00:04:37,871 --> 00:04:41,470
And if you're saying a car is breaking
down you, you engineered that script,

80
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,180
it's pretty dirty. That is dirty. Well,

81
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,050
that's how like Sean Hannity gets away
with saying that he's not a news program.

82
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,770
Does he get away with that? So it's like
WWT give news. Yeah. He says it's a,

83
00:04:50,771 --> 00:04:55,680
it's a, it's entertainment. Really.
Yeah. Oh dude, that's hilarious. Way.

84
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:59,590
You have a little, a little out. We're
not a news program. We don't claim to be.

85
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,590
He says that. Yeah. Although
a lot of people are coming to,

86
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:08,380
to thinking that's news, but isn't
he, um, uh, commentary program?

87
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:11,980
Isn't that what they say?
Oh, he's not that. He's new.
He says it's entertainment.

88
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,950
Oh yeah. Do you find
entertaining? No. You should sue,

89
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,310
I should say. It's just so I could do,
besides this entertaining, he's a liar.

90
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,740
It's not that entertaining.
I didn't find it entertaining,

91
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,100
so I'm going to sue them.
And the game of Thrones people,

92
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,810
dragons.
