Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Hey, I'm Chad. I boom, rod. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       we begin on a plane. Thank you Brooke, which carried our newly married producer Tim Howard to the Galapagos. So I took the plane from Quito. We had just finished the honeymoon that morning. They got up [inaudible] they make announcements and at a certain point the flight attendants, they open up all of the overhead bins and they walk up and down sprayings some sort of insecticide for what? For like, uh, invasive species I think. Yeah, like whatever bugs might've snuck out in the brain. But at this point I'm getting super excited and I'm thinking about Darwin and I start reading voyage of the Beagle, his book on this new book that I had bought for the trip, but then my power supply didn't work and my nook died. That was a big problem for Darren to run out of power, his book. Okay. And then the islands come into site.

Speaker 2:          00:01:03       What is the color of the Pacific Ocean when you look at the plane window? That was actually the first thing I noticed. It's this totally wild, like I've never seen like this storybook blue, green iridescent aqua marine and I, I'm thinking like, wow, this is going to be like dropping into another world, you know, like nature in its purest form. My version was is my dream of what it would be like is you land on it and it sort of like low grassy knoll and an enormous turtle comes by. The one that you could sit on the top of it, it wouldn't notice that you were there just going to meet to the airport just wandering by and that it's very similar to to what I was

Speaker 1:          00:01:41       picturing, but maybe I need [inaudible] to land. We take the 40 minute bus ride to play Yarra [inaudible] our Toyota, which turns out to be kind of a big town. Tons of people live there. Oh, it's like a fishing village. Tons. No, it's way bigger than a fishing village. And just let me say that my first hours in Galapagos work totally different than I was expecting. I'm sort of the first thing that really just like, where the hell am I? I am walking through the towns kind of late Sun is just starting to set, I'm actually walking down Charles Darwin Avenue, just kind of getting the lay of the land when all of a sudden [inaudible] this line of cars comes around the corner honking endless honking and waving flags, blue flags. At first I didn't know what that was happening, but turns out it was an election and I was just really blown away that this continued this procession for like 15 minutes.

Speaker 1:          00:03:02       And I remember asking one guy who's gonna be up though, they're driving so slow, I can just walk up to them, go and say, I've got it up. I sold car. I'm like, who's your candidate? And they're like, I didn't know who the guy was, but it turns out he was the incumbent. And I'm like, is he gonna win? And this guy he like doesn't even say anything. He just kind of points you like points at the cars in front and behind as if like, dude, seriously. You see how many of us there are? But then at a certain point I noticed this one guy by himself standing on the sidewalk wearing a white shirt and jeans. He's waving a flag, but his flag is a different color. It's white and it's really loud. But I go up to him and I yell at him, who's your candidate?

Speaker 1:          00:03:47       He said, I am a candidate. And I'm like, what are you kidding? Seriously. So his name is laminate [inaudible] [inaudible] he is a naturalist guide. You actually ended up meeting a lot of people employed that way in Galapagos and he tells me [inaudible] outsider politica politically speaking, he's an outsider. And of course I'm wondering why he's standing there by himself waving a flag at this entire parade of people who don't support him at all. And he tells me cl moment, well I'm nervous [inaudible] if the party in power now the front runners, if they get elected, they [inaudible] [inaudible] and I see a dark and uncertain future. The hotel is more big hotels, more of these enormous boats, more people [inaudible] and if things keep going this way, who's going to stand up for nature? This is Radiolab and we are dedicating the entire hour to this little set of islands. And to that question, as the world is filling up with more and more and more people, is it inevitable that even the most sacred, pristine places on the planet will eventually get swallowed up? And how far are we willing to go to return a place to what it was before we got there? And more importantly,

Speaker 3:          00:05:14       can we, oh, I'm never a doubter. Okay, so this is Linda. Linda Caio currently the science advisor for Galapagos Conservancy. I began my work in Galapagos in 1981 she first came to study tortoises back then. You know, Galapagos was really isolated,

Speaker 1:          00:05:32       barely any cars, super limited electricity.

Speaker 3:          00:05:35       All I remember is having a smile on my face all the time because you know, as a biologist going to Galapagos is like going to Mecca.

Speaker 4:          00:05:46       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:05:46       she says you have islands with massive volcanoes, forests, tree ferns that grow, you know, well above a human's height.

Speaker 1:          00:05:54       Yeah, I mean powerful colors. You know, there's

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       green mangroves, black flower flows and pink flamingos. This is Mathias Espinosa and naturalist guide in Nicola was in like Linda, he says that when he first got to the Galapagos in the 80s he couldn't believe that the place was real to his breast taken. He visited an island called Fernandina and the first thing they saw was a of fluid was moving

Speaker 4:          00:06:22       [inaudible].

Speaker 5:          00:06:23       Yes. What's what's going on, you know? No, no, that's not the lava flow. This is like 1000 seat Iguanas taking a sunbath and he says he would go on these dive.

Speaker 4:          00:06:35       Can you imagine

Speaker 5:          00:06:37       the school itself, how the head checks like 500 800 passing in front of you like tuna? I mean like, like sardines. It shows you the power. It shows you all for evolution. There is revolutions, varies child.

Speaker 2:          00:06:54       Okay, so quick context, a Galapagos islands cluster of islands way off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific, 19 bigger islands, bunch of smaller ones. And this is the place, of course, we're Darwin landed in 1835 and as he went island to island, he started noticing that there were all of these creatures that were really similar to each other, but also a little bit different. The tortoise's had different shells depending on the kind of island they lived on. The finches look similar, but their beaks were always a little bit different. And this gets him thinking, what if it isn't the way that everybody always says? What if God didn't create every single species in the beginning and leave them unchanged? What if in fact life is purely change? What if everything has been changing all the time? Darwin's five weeks on Galapagos push him to develop his theory of evolution. And that's also why when we think of evolution, we think of the Galapagos and in particular

Speaker 5:          00:07:54       we think of two iconic creatures, the tortoise

Speaker 4:          00:08:00       and the finch.

Speaker 1:          00:08:04       Let me start by telling you about the tortoise. It's hot, it's bright. It's such a perfect day for tortoise. Something are not hunting. But you know, looking for fourth day I was there. Um, I went to the island of Floriana, which Darwin visited and they're up in the highlands basically in the middle of this yard. Oh my God. There are these three massive tortoise's just clustered together under a tree. Wow. That is freaking amazing. Describes them. What do they look like? These are such alien looking creatures. They're like the size of, Jeez, I don't even know what they're massive. They look like they would crush you to death. Well, now how many years these guys have been here for? They can live for over 150 years. Wow. [inaudible] is trying to get over a branch. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:09:01       who is that? That is the sound of a tortoise breathe.

Speaker 4:          00:09:05       That's cool.

Speaker 3:          00:09:06       So, uh, Linda, when she first went to Galapagos to study these [inaudible] is about 30 years ago. I did a trip where we backpacked around the Caldera. She took a trip to this island called Isabella hiked up the side of a volcano and looked at all the tortoise country and it was an impenetrable forest, basically tortoise heaven. And what makes it so perfect for tortoise's is in the dry season in Galapagos that go Roula, which is a very, very thick mist, comes onto the island.

Speaker 6:          00:09:37       It rolls over this forest and it catches in the branches of the trees. The water then drips down from the top of the trees down to the ground creating what we call drip pools, which provides tortoises with water during the dry season. And they liked to rest in water. And so there under the trees you have these ponds with dozens of Torrid's domes just rising out of the water.

Speaker 3:          00:10:06       So that was my first experience. It was a magical, magical area. And then, um, I actually didn't get back there for maybe 15 years from when I was there the first time. And when I returned that forest was 100% gone.

Speaker 2:          00:10:27       The drip pools were just dry dust bowls. Wow. There was no shade tortoises where we're sitting out in the sun or, or crowded around the couple of stalks that were still there. This is Carl Campbell. I work for island conservation and I'm based here in the Galapagos Islands. Carl's actually the guy who showed me those tortoises. Um, it was just a, yeah, it was a barren landscape.

Speaker 3:          00:10:49       Yeah. Barron Barron grounds. What happened to the forest? Um, goats.

Speaker 2:          00:10:56       Goats. That was definitely not what I thought you were going to say. I thought you were gonna say people, it was kind of a collaboration. So here's the story.

Speaker 7:          00:11:06       Goats were originally sort of brought to the Galapagos and probably by pirates and wireless back in the 15 hundreds. You had tons of sailors making these, these long voyages across the Pacific. And uh, Galapagos was, you know, the major port on, on the whaling route, um, where yeah, you'd come and get fresh water, but you'd also, uh, come in and pick up a tortoise's plan tortoises and boats and take away several hundred of them often and turn them upside down and they can last for up to a year and a half.

Speaker 2:          00:11:36       Shit, like lying there upside down. Yeah. Lying there upside down in order to make space for the tortoises. The whalers and pirates would often take goats that they brought with them and throw them onto the islands. That way when they're on their way back and sick of eating tortoises, they could grab those goats. So whalers and Buccaneers, they introduced goats to Galapagos, but on islands like Isabella, which is this massive island size of Rhode Island, the goats were actually penned in to just a little part of it because there was this black lava rock that ran across the island stream, Lee rough lava, that's extremely difficult to walk across 12 miles of it. So that had acted as a barrier basically with goats on one side, tortoises on the other. But according to Linda, some sometime in the late 1970s the goats got brave. We were probably talking just a few goats,

Speaker 3:          00:12:29       but by the 1990s those few goats, the population had exploded and you just about a hundred thousand goats. And if you think of 100,000 goats eating everything in their path, every sort of plant that even the bark off of trees, they destroy the forest.

Speaker 2:          00:12:52       So now they had a dilemma. On the one hand, the tortoise's needed help. On the other hand, you had all of these goats that didn't choose to be on the island. You know, it wasn't their fault. And the goats that were out there were gorgeous. You know, they had curled horns, different colored fur, just beautiful animals. And they'd been there for 500 years.

Speaker 7:          00:13:13       Some people were concerned, you know, with the goats have their own sort of, if you will, right to be there. Those arguments came up frequently. Do, which Carl would respond. Yeah. Are we going to let tortoise's go extinct? Yeah. There's thousands of islands around the world that have goats on them. These tortoises are only found here. So where do your values lie?

Speaker 4:          00:13:32       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:13:32       and so in 1994 we had what we called the tortoise summit in England. And that was where we started the discussions about what are we gonna do? Experts came from all over the world. Linda says, we want to get rid of the goats. And many of them thought we were nuts and that it was impossible. There's 100,000 of them. So many doubters. Carl says he even heard the idea, why don't you put lines?

Speaker 7:          00:13:58       Yeah, they eat, go and see in Africa. Yeah, why don't you get lines on there? And those are really interesting ideas, but at some point they're going to get hungry and they're gonna start eating all the other things that you know, you treasure bike, the occasional tourist.

Speaker 2:          00:14:12       In any case, after endless planning and meetings took eight years, I think they commence

Speaker 4:          00:14:21       project Isabella.

Speaker 9:          00:14:25       So the helicopters we used, they're [inaudible] MD five hundreds small helicopter there for four passengers with one pilot, single turbine, five blades. This is phrased phrase a Sutherland. I was the engineer pilot and sharp shooter 2004 through to 2006 almost everyday. During that time, Frazier would fly over Isabela island. Two guys with two shooters are the side of the helicopter. What you do is, so you come across when you're flying along and you might see one guy says he followed that goal, does it ran away till join its friends? Do you have to find all those other guides circled real low? You'd fly around them, around them up, try and get them in with a single grape, and then you start picking off the goats one by one by one. And there are actually videos online where you see these packs of goats running for their lives and then dropping to the ground.

Speaker 10:         00:15:21       The last goat or two might sort of run into a area where it's impossible to reach, oh actually go into

Speaker 9:          00:15:27       caves. And what would do is would find a location as close as we could or ride on top of the cave, drop out one of the two shooters that was in the helicopter and he'd physically go into the cave shoe, the goats out or shoot them on site.

Speaker 10:         00:15:42       And then you go on and actually in under a year through this aerial attack, they end up wiping out 90% of the goats on Isabella. But to give an example of the nature of this business, that's Josh Donlin. He runs an NGO that was involved in project Isabella. It's relatively easy to remove 90% of a goat population from an island. But as they become rare and rare, they're harder and harder to detect. The goats become quote, educated. They learn that

Speaker 9:          00:16:10       sound means

Speaker 10:         00:16:14       so the goats start hiding. So they'll go onto bushes, they won't move to learn to stand under a tree, holding their breath. And so you end up flying around and an expensive helicopter, not finding an it goes. Now the way we deal with that, it's an interesting one. We use this technique called Judas goats. Yeah, Judas goats. Initially it was, Carl's suggestion was goats, uh, gregarious and like being in groups. They're herd animals, right? And so, uh, the technique that we would use was you would fire them,

Speaker 9:          00:16:47       the helicopter, you fly around, you'd find some goats, you capture goats, capture them, lie, and then come back back to base camp. Offload Dan and

Speaker 10:         00:16:57       we put a radio collar on him and you throw them back on the island and then you wait. Instinctively that lone guy will go and find out the goats. A week. Two weeks go by, you fire up the helicopter, they get back over

Speaker 11:         00:17:14       the island with this little device. It's a directional antenna. Start Tracking the Judas go fill. They spot it with some other goats and then

Speaker 10:         00:17:25       everyone gets shot except the Judas go there. [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         00:17:30       go finds more friends and then

Speaker 10:         00:17:34       everyone gets shot except the Judas go. And then they do it again. Everyone will get shot except the Judas go. And you do that every two weeks for a year. Oh my God. And that is how they

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       go from 90% go free to 91 to 92 to 93 to 94 just like having a pogrom on you over and over and over again. Jesus, it gets worse. Now Judas Goat is a good Judas goat until it gets pregnant cause then it doesn't want to be social anymore. It goes off and has this kid and is very solitary, which is the last thing you want when you're trying to get goats off islands. So Carl kept mulling this problem. What would it take to basically make, you know, the the perfect year disco, the Ideal Judas goat, if you will. Um, is it goat that would search for and be searched for and that would never get pregnant. So curl Campbell figured out a technique where we could sterilize them in the field. It grabbed the goats Darden and then in a matter of minutes SnipSnap did you do this?

Speaker 2:          00:18:38       Yeah. Well I, I stood next to Karl and watched him do it and Carl took it one step further and he actually gave these females hormone implants, basically put them in the heat for an extended duration. Normally a female goat would be in heat for maybe a couple of days. These females would go for more than 190 days. And wherever they went, they would lower those male goats out of their caves. So that, you know, all in all over the course of this two year program, we had hundreds of Judas goats out and using those goats, they were able to go from 94% goat free to 96 to 97 to 98. And basically when you have only Judas goats meeting up with other Judas Coats, then you can say the goats have been eliminated, that you're down a point. They got to, at least on Isabella in mid 2006,

Speaker 4:          00:19:31       uh,

Speaker 2:          00:19:34       this kind of eradication program was far beyond anything that anyone had ever done anywhere in the room because it turns out they weren't just doing this on Isabella island. No, we're talking about island by island. Over the course of about seven years, they eliminate over 250,000 goats.

Speaker 4:          00:19:58       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:20:00       so you, um, you complete that with Isabella and did it work? Yeah. The results of this were absolutely impressive. You had plants re-emerging you had trees growing back and in a really short period of time and this allowed for those important drip pools and tortoises, they basically got their home back.

Speaker 9:          00:20:23       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       this is a real thing. Tortoise's walking around

Speaker 9:          00:20:34       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:20:35       same craven. So they did it. They got all the goats, not all the goats. What do you mean there's Judas goats? They kept them around. Why? I would just, I would've shot them first out of sympathy for them. Yeah, exactly. Well, they needed the goats because, well there was the problem of people

Speaker 4:          00:21:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:21:04       because during the 90s these demonstrations started.

Speaker 4:          00:21:07       That happened.

Speaker 9:          00:21:10       Demonstrations. So outrage and violent activities.

Speaker 4:          00:21:15       Yeah.

Speaker 9:          00:21:15       Constant conflict to explain [inaudible] [inaudible] this is Augustine Lopez, longtime fisherman. And he told me that in the 70s and eighties [inaudible] lobster was fished all year round. Have you have it yet? Okay, no restrictions. And then fishermen started making a killing fishing sea cucumber because there was this huge demand. But then the national park comes in, same group that's doing the goat eradication and they tell the fisherman they're overfishing, the sea cucumber. They've got to limit their catch. And the fishermen are like, who are you to tell me that I can't feed my family? So they lash out.

Speaker 4:          00:21:55       [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          00:21:56       they marched down Charles Darwin Avenue. They would come down the street throwing rocks and sticks and everything. And that's Paul Watson, founder of this East Shepherd Conservation Society. He was there counter protesting, and he says that at one point they went after national park buildings and they were attacking the ranger stations with Molotov cocktails. They blockaded roads. They literally drove the Rangers out of the National Park headquarters and took it over on Isabella. They burned down a building, the kidnap some people, including some of my crew. And they even killed dozens of towards

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       it says slitting their throats according to some accounts. They even hung them from trees. Uh, so, but not only that, but according to Linda, those goats, couple islands where they've been eliminated, fishermen have put them back. Really? Oh yeah. And so what they decided to do is leave the Judas goats on various islands where they can live out their sterilized days, chomping on grass, sharing war stories until such time

Speaker 9:          00:23:03       as they might be needed. Again.

Speaker 2:          00:23:11       It, the F is the war between the Greens and the and the fisherman and Sochi. Is that still hot and difficult and are they still, you know, killing tortoises and they're not the fishermen? Um, they seem to have stopped, you know, taking over national park and killing tortoises to know why it, it's a combination of reasons. On the one hand, fishermen have started to participate in the actual fisheries management more cause it seems like they realize if they're going to keep their livelihood, they can't just fish everything out. But then at the same

Speaker 10:         00:23:46       time the tourism economy has been taking off. And so all of these fishermen, they find that it's easier for them to actually survive by using their boats, um, to take tourists around island to island. So they're all kind of converting over into the tourism economy. We're going to take a short break. This is Radiolab. We'll be back with producer Tim Howard and this hour on Galapagos in just a moment.

Speaker 10:         00:25:09       I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab and this hour, well the honeymoon's over Galapagos. This is the place where Darwin began to develop his theory of evolution and it's the place 170 year or maybe, Eh, 180 years later where our producer Tim Howard landed wearing fishnets in a bad brains tee shirt to find, to find a very different landscape than what Darwin saw. And we just told you a story about how far humans are willing to go to protect something. This next part, it's about how far we're willing to go to get something back that we've already lost to sort of restore a place and a creature to its quote. Wild state. This story unfolds on one of Galapagos is most northern islands where they also had to get rid of some goats. Oh, it's called Pinta. Pinta. Pintos was a very special place. This is James Gibson, professor of conservation biology at the State University of New York. It's a one of those islands. It's not part of any tourist visitation site. So there are no people there. And uh, when you set foot first on Pinto, you immediately sense sure

Speaker 4:          00:26:18       [inaudible] birds

Speaker 10:         00:26:21       problem is on pin a, things were spinning out of control.

Speaker 2:          00:26:26       The vegetation was growing wild, the forest was getting overgrown with the wrong kind of plant. And the whole ecosystem was just teetering out of balance.

Speaker 10:         00:26:38       And one of the reasons for this, according to Linda Coyote is that we had an island with no tortoises

Speaker 2:          00:26:44       because tortoises are sorta like the lawn mower.

Speaker 3:          00:26:47       You know, they, they plow down vegetation, disperse seeds,

Speaker 2:          00:26:51       but for centuries had been hunted by those whalers. And in about 1906, the pinto tortoise went extinct. 1906 yeah, a little over a hundred years ago. They don't know the exact date, but then one evening in March of 1972 yes, this fellow pizza, she h partook. He's a well known tortoise researcher. He was on Santa Cruz island having dinner with some friends and we got to chatting about tours. And one of the people he's eating with says, Hey, uh, I was recently on Pinna island collecting snails and I saw this tortoise

Speaker 14:         00:27:26       and I thought, do you know what you have done? [inaudible] a hundred years.

Speaker 2:          00:27:31       He in some National Park Rangers race out to Pinta and there was this beautiful shoulders, one male tortoise, maybe 50 years old. They weren't sure they'd eventually name Him George Lonesome George. But at the time the immediate question was, are there any more? Because if they could find a female for George, then they could, you know, maybe de extinct the species.

Speaker 14:         00:27:56       So I poked around in the areas where we've got the one and I found a shell of a female dead animal. Oh, it won't happen.

Speaker 2:          00:28:06       Well, how had, how had this female toward his died?

Speaker 14:         00:28:10       Uh, someone chopped it in half. No, you see the marks where it was just chopped up. I felt violent. I wanted to borrow someone's gun. I'd gone kill the person.

Speaker 2:          00:28:23       Everyone held out hopes for just finding more tortoises back. James says they kept going back and combing the island with highly trained tortoise sniffing dogs. But in the end there was just, George then shifted the focus on, now what do we do? We then went to a wolf volcano island next door and collected two females, two females that sort of looked like George but weren't quite the same species.

Speaker 3:          00:28:45       And we put them with George to see if we could get him to breed. He never did

Speaker 2:          00:28:51       well. It's an interesting, so they thought, hmm, maybe he needs a pinto lady. So now of course there are no female tortoises on Pinta, but they thought, you know, maybe a zoo somewhere or private collection has one cause you really never know. So they called around, offered huge cash rewards. People sent in dozens of tortoises. But Linda took one look at them and was like, no, no, no, no, they weren't Pinterest. So then they thought we've got to take matters into our own hands.

Speaker 3:          00:29:18       Basically what you do is you sit at the back of the tortoise and first you have to get to where they'll allow you to touch them. Um, and eventually you start, um, you know, fondling their, their legs and tails and, and hoping to get them to ejaculate and had a volunteer working with me. Her name was viva greed, Gianni. She worked with

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       him every other day or so for a few months and was never successful. We were really starting to get kind of desperate about options. And James says, in a way it was a paradox because on the one hand, awesome, we have an actual living Pinta island tortoise. But on the other hand, he might've actually been like the worst possible candidate for last of his kind. He seemed to really like to keep to himself. He never really liked other tortoises much. He didn't seem to like humans and maybe that's why he survived. He wasn't curious. Yes. James says a lot of tortoises, they hear your footsteps, they raise their heads, they come out to see what's going on and then they get whacked. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:30:21       In any case, for about 40 years, scientists tried everything humanly possible to get loan, some George to meet with another tortoise so they could resurrect the species and bring Pinta island back to its original state. Nothing worked until one day in July of 2008 George turns to the two female tortoises that he had been ignoring for years and he says inexplicably, he just suddenly decides to me with both of them, they each lay eggs. Two clutches were ultimately laid in his corral and the scientists are like, doc George got our hopes up dramatically, but they ultimately were infertile.

Speaker 15:         00:31:13       Mother

Speaker 2:          00:31:15       mid eighties they were having a meeting about this. That's conservationist. Josh Donlin again, whole bunch of herpetologists were out there and some island conservationist and they're talking about what to do Pinta and they can't get one of them, George to reproduce, which we were hoping to do because then they could build a Pinta population and put it on Pinta and he says that as the meeting wore on, it got tense. Oh, for sure. In fact, one guy spoke

Speaker 16:         00:31:37       Harry Green, I'm a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Cornell University

Speaker 2:          00:31:41       said that at this meeting there was one guy who just couldn't take it.

Speaker 16:         00:31:44       Oh, all I remember is him just fuming. He sat there getting more and more and more frustrated. Then finally he just blurted out, shoot that tortoise and uh, quit wasting our time.

Speaker 4:          00:32:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:32:01       because in his view, this, the single individual was holding up this huge conservation [inaudible]

Speaker 16:         00:32:08       and of course the shock was there was a way went around the room when he said that. I recall seeing sort of second wave as the Spanish translation of passed around the room.

Speaker 2:          00:32:17       And really what that guy was specifically saying was, don't be precious. A tortoise as a tortoise, as a tortoise. Let's just take some tortoises from a nearby island and put them back on Penta, but there's a much bigger question here that that goes way beyond globe

Speaker 4:          00:32:32       [inaudible],

Speaker 2:          00:32:32       which is basically like, what is the right way to protect nature? Now people are right now throwing beers at each

Speaker 17:         00:32:40       other around what is the right strategy.

Speaker 4:          00:32:44       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:32:44       Josh says that there are basically two camps right now on the one side, you've got this classic, like what you might call Eden approach conservation biology.

Speaker 6:          00:32:53       It's foundation is this idea of pristine wilderness from the very beginning. I think all of us, well, I can't speak for other people, but, but you always have this idea of wanting to get it back to some kind of pre human condition.

Speaker 2:          00:33:08       Every human being the operative word. And, and if you think about it, we all have this. We all have this, this picture of what we want to bring it all back to, you know what might be like, oh, the planes just covered with buffalo, or, or maybe the Serengeti desert with lions and elephants, or maybe it's 10,000 hammerhead sharks, but whatever the scene is, it just doesn't have any people. But is carrying that idea, those pictures of your head even like youthful anymore. It's like so Sanuk no, but it just seems so unrealistic.

Speaker 17:         00:33:40       Right? But I mean, in the bigger picture, you can make the argument that humans now affect every square meter of the earth.

Speaker 6:          00:33:47       There's no place, no matter how remote we get, you can go to the North Pole. It's been affected by human activity. You can go, I don't know, the depths of the impenetrable jungle. It's been affected by human activity.

Speaker 2:          00:34:00       That's how they dream is she's an environmental law professor at the Berkeley School of law in California. You're radically remaking the world. And the question is, what's our responsibility? And this brings us to our second school of thought, which in its most extreme version goes something like this. We're God. Yeah,

Speaker 17:         00:34:17       we might as well get good at it. And we're going to have to create these ecosystems based on our best science.

Speaker 2:          00:34:28       And you could argue we're going to have to get a whole lot better at making some very, very difficult decisions.

Speaker 6:          00:34:36       Climate change seems to mean that a lot of species are pretty much doomed, 30% 40% 50% of the species now on the planet in a few decades maybe disappearing. And this is what I think is really the tough question now is if we can see EAD that we can't any longer save all the species, then does that put us in the situation of having to decide which ones we'll save and which ones we won't? And do we have any basis for making those kinds of decisions?

Speaker 4:          00:35:12       Hmm.

Speaker 6:          00:35:13       So you're saying that the, that the club, let's go back to when it was good. Let's go back to a better time. That's just silly. I didn't say it was silly. Okay. What did you yeah, I said it was impossible. Thinks might not be silly. They might not be stupid ideas, but we still might not be able to do them. Okay. So here's, um, a

Speaker 8:          00:35:38       plaque. It says lonesome George is the last survivor of the dynasty of land. Tortoise is from Pinta island. And in fact in 2012 after decades of trying to get him to, to Breed

Speaker 18:         00:35:53       [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          00:35:54       lonesome George Dies r I p 24th of June, 2012

Speaker 10:         00:36:01       and the [inaudible] went extinct. So damn case in point, I guess no, going back. Yeah, I mean that's what I thought. But then I spoke with this woman. Hello. Hello. Just tell it. Do you hear me? Yes, I do. Who kind of scrambled everything up for me. Can I get you to, um, introduce yourself? Yes. My name is [inaudible]. I am a senior research scientist at Yale University. And just tell us, come up with kind of a radical idea. I call it the Phoenix project. Here's the backstory. In the mid nineties we started in 94 to Cielo and some folks from the Galapagos National Park, they began taking a census of all the tortoises in the Galapagos, the population of tortoises on all the islands. They were going to do this big population studies. So they went island by island, took a little bit of blood from all these different tortoises, did a genetic analysis and Oh, pla found something they never expected. A group of tortoise is not on Pinta that had a lot of Pinto

Speaker 19:         00:36:58       DNA. I remember very clearly. That moment was very, very exciting. It's like, yes, look at this. Yeah.

Speaker 10:         00:37:06       Wait, you're saying this Pinta DNA was on a nother island? Yeah. None on Pinta. No. Well, how would that happen? Um, we don't think it was natural. Just Ella thinks it might've been the whalers made. They're the whalers or the pirates,

Speaker 1:          00:37:19       you know, because like we talked about in the 1718 hundreds these whalers would come along, grab a bunch of tortoises, put them on the ship, and then they would hunt for whales or [inaudible]. And sometimes when they were done in the, the ship was filled with Wale products. Here they throw a few extra tortoises overboard. Say a few from Pinta, maybe those pins, tortoises swam with occurrence to that nearby island set up a little ex-pat community

Speaker 18:         00:37:48       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:37:49       and started breeding with the locals. That's our working hypothesis, which brings us to her idea.

Speaker 18:         00:37:57       Perfect.

Speaker 19:         00:37:58       You know, on average 50% of your genome comes from your mom and 50% from your dad, but it's an average.

Speaker 10:         00:38:05       So just sell it though. Just by chance, some of these tortoises, they're gonna have a little bit more Pinta DNA from their Pinta ancestors than others. Yes. So what if we took those tortoises

Speaker 19:         00:38:15       and bred them together? So act them for the next generation so that you can give a push to this process. She says, if we keep doing this, taking the babies with the most painted DNA, breeding them together slowly, surely in four generations you could have 90% of the painter genome restored. Really? Yeah. But

Speaker 10:         00:38:36       that's four generations of tortoises, not rats, which means at least a hundred years. But in the meantime, the, the vegetation on Pinta is growing out of control from an ecological point of view. Painter can't wait. So in 2009 they come up with a stop gap. They take 39 tortoises raised in captivity and they use them as placeholders. They sterilize them and put them on Pinta. [inaudible]. Yeah. Well these are very purest sort of visions. Okay. Yeah. They sterilize them. 39 of them should, they're just basically the lawn mowers. They're not. Exactly, and they put them on Pinto and they're just chomping away right now. They're living out their lives really happily on Pinta, you know, until the originals are ready. Now Linda says in the end, you don't actually need to do the full aggressive for generation breeding thing. You can just take the best Pinta is tortoises you find

Speaker 6:          00:39:31       and put those on Pinto and you know, over the next 200,000 years they will evolve into a paint a tortoise and it could be a bit different than the past. Paint a tortoise because evolution and mutation and all of that doesn't occur the same. But eventually nature's going to take over and they will evolve into painted tortoises.

Speaker 4:          00:40:07       [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          00:40:08       is this the way that everybody who works on the tortoises thinks about it? This kind of deep time? I don't know. I'm not sure many other people think about that.

Speaker 10:         00:41:20       We'll be back in less than 200,000 years am but we will be different when we come back and we will stay tuned. Hi, this is Emily calling from rainy Vancouver, Washington. Radiolab is supported in part by the National Science Foundation

Speaker 20:         00:42:20       I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab today, a whole hour on the Galapagos Islands. The place that inspired Charles Darwin to create his theory of evolution, whose basic ingredients are lots of time isolation and then constant change. But Darwin didn't consider this possibility. What if on these islands, thousands of tourists arrive every day carrying fruits and chocolates and souvenirs, jumping from island to island. Now the Galapagos government spends millions of dollars checking all of the goods that come in and out trying to quarantine the ones that might have things that are a problem. But what if simply putting your foot on the ground can completely transform it?

Speaker 10:         00:43:02       A place that [inaudible] active producer Tim Howard. So I met this woman named Hunky Yeager, who is a like a plant scientist. I'm the restoration ecologist at the Charles Darwin Foundation, and here we are in Los Angeles. We were going to look at these incredible craters called low semi-loads. Oh, I almost got hit by a car. And as we're walking along the path, let's see. She's like, oh wait, look at this right here. She points just to the right of the path. Look at this species here. Small leafy green thing. They call it Yangton and Spanish. It is in it's plantar ago, I think in the u s they call it the, um, was it the wrench of the white man?

Speaker 10:         00:43:47       The range of the white man? Yes. It's actually the footprint of the white man. It doesn't matter. Point is an introduced species. It's introduced, it's found in Europe. North Africa shouldn't be here. And you have this one here. She points right next to it. It's called Titus Canthia sharpie thing. A green and white leaves. It has a terrible common name in English. I'm not going to say it. Wandering Jew basic house plant. You can buy it at home depot, but a, there it is in the Galapagos. And um, along this path, just looking to the right and the left. And then she just starts counting the number of invasive species at one, two, three, four. As you can see here, it's only right next to the trail, but not so much for them. You see that they're only there for this border of about to 10 inches

Speaker 2:          00:44:32       along the edge of that path. Why would that be? Because hunky said, what happens is it Taurus, they'll be back in their home country, there'll be walking around in a garden or a park and it'll be filled with tiny seeds. The seeds stick

Speaker 10:         00:44:46       tissues and socks and chowders. They wear the trousers on a plane and then they wear them when they come here, and then people walk and then just distribute or disperse the seats along the trail. Wow. Now most of these plants are actually probably harmless and you know, like you said, Galapagos National Park, they spend tons of money, tons of time trying to keep invasives out, but the fact is there's only so much you can do. And every once in a while, one of these hitchhikers slips under the radar and just wreaks havoc.

Speaker 21:         00:45:18       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:45:23       you just grabbed it just like that. You just put your hands around here. That's the only possible the first day. So while we were in the highlands of Santa Cruz, Hunky took me through the woods to meet this guy named Arno. My name is Onecima. Dom is an ornithologist from the University of Vienna. And shortly after we walked up, he reached out into this tree and he grabbed this tiny little baby fins right off the branch is the door. Well, he says, oh my God, he said he, he looks a little bit furry, almost really tiny vulnerable. A fledgling of a, of finch. [inaudible] is the smallest of the Darwin's finches. You can like see him pulsing kind of as he breathing. So Darwin's finches. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:46:04       In short, Darwin, when he visited Galapagos, he collected a lot of specimens of finches, took them back to England, and eventually he realized

Speaker 20:         00:46:13       that the beaks had all adapted. They were all little bit different depending on which island the finches lived on with the beaks. Beaks adapt to whatever the thing is you're eating. One islands finches had literally like the beak would be shaped sort of long. And then the next island it would look almost the same but much shorter. And this became one of the, one of the most important pieces of evidence that, you know, when animals would move from one place to another, that they would begin to differentiate based on what cities are very, very important things. Yes.

Speaker 10:         00:46:45       But speaking of beaks, that finch, that Arno is holding, it's just the Fred, his beak that you see the specially decide is extremely huge. Yeah. Oh, the nostrils. Nostrils have have big holes. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:47:03       Something had gotten inside this little finches, nostrils drilled these holes, and it was no eating the flesh on the inside of the birds nostrils. Scientists first began to see this in 1997 when they started to find nests full of dead baby finches. At first, nobody had any idea what kind of creature it was. So they began to frantically study it. I actually visited

Speaker 10:         00:47:30       one of the main researchers, PA doddling Congo. I keep the name of [inaudible]. She's lived in Galapagos for over a decade. And she showed me her lab.

Speaker 1:          00:47:39       I'm surrounded by shelves and on the shelves there are these tiny little plastic cups that are filled with, um, flies.

Speaker 10:         00:47:48       This is the villain. But I see say Solo [inaudible] a little black fly looks like every other flies is [inaudible]. In fact, P dot. Says that it's actually in the same family as the regular house fly, but it's actually a bot fly called the Lorena's down z. Can you just spell fullness down z? Yeah, it's p. H. I. L. I can't spell out loud feel lore. L. O. R. N. I. S. D. O. W. N. S. I. Okay. Following this actually means, but loving that Charlotte Coston, she's a researcher at the Charles Darwin Foundation. She says, there's actually very little known about the fly. They're not sure where it came from or quite how it got here, but here's what they do know.

Speaker 4:          00:48:37       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:48:37       the adult fly seems to be harmless, yet a fly is actually vegetarian. It feeds on flowers and we think decomposing fruits, baby flies. They're not vegetarian. That will, you know, suck blood. And what happens is that I'm, as soon as bad start laying eggs, mother flies swoop in and lay their eggs on the base of the nest, sort of underneath the finch eggs. Once the eggs hatch,

Speaker 10:         00:49:07       the eggs hatch of the flies as well. And the larvae wriggling little larva will crawl out from the bottom of the nest of the finches body into its beat. And they go into the noses and, um, of, uh, of the baby finches and just started eating. You know, they basically, um, feed on the blood of the, the baby beds. How did these little fly babies? No, I mean, that's a, that's a very specific trip to take. Good question. We're still trying to figure that out. Um, you know, we assumed that it was carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide from the breathing of the beds. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:49:49       She's opening a box of some of the birds that little, um, being sewn as the finches. Oh God. It's the noise. No to man.

Speaker 10:         00:49:59       Pa Dad showed me this, this tiny little dead finch in the spa.

Speaker 1:          00:50:06       [inaudible] wow. There's a little hole into the brain of this little finch. Oh my God. Wiggle in there and I spotted that they ate the whole back of this little finch.

Speaker 10:         00:50:18       It's a, how big a problem is this? Well, I talked to one scientist, Sonia Klein. Dorfer, I'm professor in animal behavior at Flinders University, South Australia. And she told only that researchers recently did a survey of finch nest for different species on two islands and all research groups found about 95% mortality in the nest. 95% of the babies were dead. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:50:43       And Arno told me that this year, small tree finches. So far we have only two nests with fledglings and all the others were on that. So it's a lot. Yeah,

Speaker 10:         00:50:53       but even worse so far, we found file on us on 39 islands. The flies spreading island to island. Is there any timescale we should worry about? Like are these finches disappearing very fast? Very slowly. Depends on the species. We have at least five species that are known to be facing extinction and another six in serious decline. These five species, does that mean that they may go extinct in the next five years, in the next 50 years? I hope not. Um, you know, we have the case of the mangrove finch. We have 60 to 80 individuals left. Wow. It's a race against time.

Speaker 22:         00:51:39       [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:51:39       So for starters, they put up all these tracks and [inaudible] and they took me outside. They showed me where the traps are. A trap hanging from a tree here and you see them actually all over Santa Cruz, these bright yellow traps hanging from trees. [inaudible] Lord in his own name. But, and this is to control the fly population? No, no, no. They would need like millions of drops every few feet to do that. This is just to grab a few flies, take them back to the lab

Speaker 10:         00:52:01       and study them so they can learn how to fight him. Charlotte and pay Dodd's fantasy is that the flies use a pheromone to attract the opposite sex CDO finally testicle. It would be lovely if we could find something like that because if they could find that chemical, that love chemical that the flies use to attract each other, they could disrupt it, confused the flies and screw up their mating. And another possibility is sterile insect technique, sterilize male flies and introduce them back into the wild so that the female, I'm mates with a starer fly and obviously doesn't produce fertile eggs. If they can't make babies, the population will crash. And in some cases you can successfully eradicate a species. This is very much like the mosquitoes that Andy talked about a couple podcasts ago. Right. But here's the problem. [inaudible] if they're gonna release sterilize male flies into the wild, they have to be able to raise [inaudible] million.

Speaker 2:          00:52:59       These fires in the lab [inaudible] and they're trying like crazy showing me all of the larvas that hatch today. And that showed me four baby flies that had just hatched and they're in these Little Cup [inaudible] but she told me that these four flies will probably die. Mm.

Speaker 10:         00:53:20       Because they always die. Right now we have huge problems trying rear file on this and captivity, which is ironic given you know how abundant it is in the wild [inaudible] when I was there. Yeah. That told me that so far they had only successfully raised three, $3 flies when you're saying they needed millions. Yeah. And meanwhile the finch populations are just getting decimated. Charlotte says that they're trying to respond. Ornithologists have started to notice some new behaviors. For instance, picking the Lafayette of the nostrils of, of the baby birds. And what we're starting to see is that they're beginning to consume them. You mean eat the fly lower? Yeah. Which 15 years ago they would never do. Back in the year 2000 Sonya and some colleagues tried feeding the finches some fly larva. And if ever there were a look of disgust on a finch face, that was it. So I think there's been a change. They're also seeing baby finches climbing up over each other, just struggling to get away from the larva on the bottom of the nest. I'm, and they'll even start standing on the nest room just to avoid being eaten by it. When I asked Charlotte what she makes of all of these changes, she said, um, I think probably too little, too late.

Speaker 4:          00:54:42       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         00:54:42       but then Sonia told me something really surprising. Yeah. That, that was a very unexpected discovery. Takes a couple steps to get there, but just to set it up, back in 2000 she was on Floriana island for the first time I started studying Darwin's finches in particular three Trufant species, the small, the medium and the large. And we went out and we, we set up our mist nets and we caught the birds and we measured them. And the thing to know is that even though these are three different species, they're actually really hard to tell apart visually. So she would end up relying on their songs, their mating calls. Yep. Do you remember the song types? Could you whistle them for me? Oh yes. It's, it's a very simple song. The small tree finch goes something like two, two, two two two two two

Speaker 19:         00:55:27       [inaudible].

Speaker 10:         00:55:28       That's a small tree finch and the, the medium tree finch is just a bit slower for the medium as a t, t t t for the large g, g G. G. Wow. It's like a soprano saxophone in an alto and the 10 or something like that. That's right. So we, we just, you know, sat in the forest and we're, and we would always quiz each other. What's that? What's that? And we all agreed because the calls are really distinct, easy to tell apart. But the interesting thing was from year to year, it got more difficult. As Tony says, each time she'd go into the field, the song sounded like they were starting to blur together.

Speaker 10:         00:56:13       Then when I showed up after a few years, again, I was truly even more perplexed. Should I dad, why can't I tell these finches apart? It was very confusing. Am I losing my touch? But that shouldn't really happen. You should actually get better with experience. Not Worse. And that's where I thought, oh, something's changed in the system. I like to think of it as a kind of, um, Darwin finch, you know, slew thing, adventure. So Sonia and your team rounded up some of the birds they tagged and we collected genetic samples, got some DNA and song samples, made some recordings. Yep. Brought all this stuff into the lab, analyze the genetic samples and had this terrible realization that the large tree finches now extinct.

Speaker 4:          00:57:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:57:00       totally gone from the island. So you really only had two species left. You had the small tree finches and the medium tree finches. And based on that genetic data, the small tree finches not doing great, but compared to the medium tree finches they are because the medium tree finches were on the brink of extinction like a large ones. Yeah. But then she sees something amazing in that genetic data. She sees a small group of birds who have mixed up genes, a hybrid cluster, some genes from the small tree finches and some from the medium tree finches. Huh? What does that mean? Well, it means that these two different finches had started having babies together, which should never actually happen because these are totally separate species. That's really the classical definition of a species is like a biological rule about who you're not going to make a baby with.

Speaker 2:          00:57:54       So they, they choose not to breed even if they could for who knows, maybe a million years. The medium tree finch has patrolled that boundary. Like, I've got my thing over here. You got your thing over there. But then along come the flies and all of a sudden like over maybe 20 years, these medium tree finches, they start to break their own biggest rule and they start to meet outside of their own kind. And these hybrid finches, are they doing better against the flies? Well, there's, there's a couple of clues that say maybe, yeah. For example, when you look at

Speaker 10:         00:58:29       in the nest, they seem to have fewer parasites and they seem to have more babies that survive 15% wow. Whereas the numbers were very small for the medium tree finch and smaller for the small tree finch. Wow. I dare say that sounds kind of hopeful. It does. Yeah. Now the jury is still very much out on what will happen, but if the hybrids do have a fitness advantage and if they survive, we may be witnessing in hyperspeed the creation of an entirely new species. It would possibly be one of the first vertebrate examples of speciation in real time that we can observe. So talk to into the story of these finches

Speaker 23:         00:59:20       is the story of Galapagos.

Speaker 4:          00:59:25       Uh,

Speaker 23:         00:59:25       same exact story that Darwin saw. These processes that you've described

Speaker 4:          00:59:31       [inaudible]

Speaker 23:         00:59:31       they just never ever stopped. It's this [inaudible] ending struggle.

Speaker 4:          01:00:25       [inaudible]

Speaker 10:         01:00:32       one last thing. My last night there, I went to meet up with that Guy Lonidas who was running for mayor. I met him at this pizza place. The election had happened the night before. And did he win? No. A Buccellati the incumbent one. So we, we go outside. Chelonian [inaudible] Paralis I was running as the mayor. Turns out he speaks some English. So we, you know, we do this interview in English and I'm, I'm almost embarrassed that I wanted to talk to him because I think that dude is just going to be so down and out. Exactly the opposite. He was so joyful to have lost. That's what I thought. You're not sad. You're not sad. Oh No. Never Fred. And he's like, friend, this is a field of four. The other three all have money behind them. And you see their flags all over Santa Cruz. I just came in second. Whoa. The guy who wins. He spent $500,000 I spent what, two grand? It's

Speaker 5:          01:01:28       the beginning. Is DV [inaudible] of a new, a new future for the Galapagos island. We are ascending and we keep, we have our dreams up. So nature has a boys. Now the sea lion has a boys in us. The tortoise as a Boise, not the penguin in everywhere. So something is happening. That's exactly how he sees it. So thank you very much for the interview. I hope you enjoy the Galapagos island. We call that the song [inaudible] producer Tim hour before we close. Very special thanks to Matthew Judas kilty without whom Tim have been crushed

Speaker 2:          01:02:20       just by the sheer amount of tape that he gathered from deed. Also, thanks to Dylan Key for original music. Thanks to Trish Dolman and screen siren pictures. Alex Galfond, Mathias Espinosa, the naturals guide from the first chapter who wrote this song, peak open zone. He's also a well known musician in Galapagos. Turns out thanks to the Galapagos National Park, Charles Darwin Foundation island conservation and the Galapagos conservancy. I'm Chan. I'm from Rod. I Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
