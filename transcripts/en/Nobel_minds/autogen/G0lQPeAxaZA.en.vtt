some say scientists that I wanted to be

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180
some say scientists that I wanted to be
 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.820

like that person I think this is also

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830
like that person I think this is also
 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.650
like that person I think this is also
part of a success story because you have

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
part of a success story because you have
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.749
part of a success story because you have
to find your own way it's very important

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759
to find your own way it's very important
 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.400
to find your own way it's very important
that they do something from the bottom

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410
that they do something from the bottom
 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.770
that they do something from the bottom
of your own heart and and you find

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780
of your own heart and and you find
 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.609
of your own heart and and you find
yourself in what you do or in the work

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619
yourself in what you do or in the work
 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.220
yourself in what you do or in the work
but of course I had my scientists who

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
but of course I had my scientists who
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.450
but of course I had my scientists who
had yeah come up with fundamental and

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460
had yeah come up with fundamental and
 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.589
had yeah come up with fundamental and
and interesting ideas with new new ideas

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599
and interesting ideas with new new ideas
 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.799
and interesting ideas with new new ideas
I mean clearly to some extent Iceland

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
I mean clearly to some extent Iceland
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630
I mean clearly to some extent Iceland
has always been a role model in a way of

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
has always been a role model in a way of
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.850
has always been a role model in a way of
course I'm there's no comparison with

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
course I'm there's no comparison with
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.760

things differently not caring about

conventions these are elements in his

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399
conventions these are elements in his
 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.369
conventions these are elements in his
attitude of course that that are there

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379
attitude of course that that are there
 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.380
attitude of course that that are there
should be role models for all of us

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390
should be role models for all of us
 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.779
should be role models for all of us
scientists and they are of course but I

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789
scientists and they are of course but I
 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.819
scientists and they are of course but I
also have great admiration for people

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829
also have great admiration for people
 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.110

like Richard Fineman I read his book and

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120
like Richard Fineman I read his book and
 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.740
like Richard Fineman I read his book and
his biographies and when I was a student

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750
his biographies and when I was a student
 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.100
his biographies and when I was a student
and I find I find very inspiring his

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110
and I find I find very inspiring his
 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.950
and I find I find very inspiring his
attitude she explained quantum mechanics

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
attitude she explained quantum mechanics
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960
attitude she explained quantum mechanics
in his own way and that was really great

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
in his own way and that was really great
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.330
in his own way and that was really great
because it gave you some insight and he

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
because it gave you some insight and he
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.410
because it gave you some insight and he
let that let him to do to a new way of

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420
let that let him to do to a new way of
 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.899
let that let him to do to a new way of
coming up with with with new things

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909
coming up with with with new things
 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.749
coming up with with with new things
quantum electrodynamics and these are

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
quantum electrodynamics and these are
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.359
quantum electrodynamics and these are
these are role models in a way but of

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369
these are role models in a way but of
 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.149
these are role models in a way but of
course I have to do my own thing and I

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
course I have to do my own thing and I
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.780
course I have to do my own thing and I
have to do it very much my own way
