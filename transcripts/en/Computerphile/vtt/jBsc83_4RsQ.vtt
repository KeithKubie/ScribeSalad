00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
This this two-factor authentication; so
basically to get in

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:10.920
I need my card and then I need a PIN and
this is a scrambler pad so basically

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.600
every time that you look at that the
numbers are in a different order.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.120
This is the High Performance Computing facility for the university of Nottingham.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.580
SEAN&gt;&gt; What do you use it for?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.740
All sorts of things it's
basically to do with the high compute

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.910
research so for example students and
researchers will use this for doing

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.410
calculations based on things like fluid
dynamics, aerospace, genomics...

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460
All sorts of things anything which requires
- astronomy - that's what anything that

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.600
requires a large amount of compute.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.780
SEAN&gt;&gt; And you've got earplugs in today for obvious reasons

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.040
Yes it's a litte bit noisy in
here yes yeah...

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.340
SEAN&gt;&gt; So we will do some talking outside (LINK IN DESCRIPTION) but can you show us a bit of it before we go outside?

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.180
Certainly yes yes the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:10.660
main HPC facility which we call
Minerva is...

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
...and then we've got some extensions in, on the racks on here.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.540
SEAN&gt;&gt; All of these's blinking lights what's going on is this data activity..

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.000
...or processing what's going on there?

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.940
Both! The actual lights that you can see there, the brighter ones, those are

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:32.880
actually the storage, the disk storage the
actual compute nodes don't actually

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.100
blink very much. The ones at the bottom
there that's the network activity.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.580
We do shut it down for maintenance once a year for a day or so

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.920
this at the moment is the third
generation of HPC - the first one...

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.720
...which was installed about eleven years ago and then we regularly refresh this.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.580
SEAN&gt;&gt; So this one's been going for how long or how long is this been? This one's been going for about four years.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.320
SEAN&gt;&gt; Okay and then I hear rumors of a
new one on the horizon?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.100
Yes we're in the procurement at the moment to put a replacement in

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.920
SEAN&gt;&gt; and will that mean this gets ripped out and the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.440
whole new one just gets put in?

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.620
Good question, we would like to utilize as

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.930
much as possible because although it is
old you know there is still life left in

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.480
it and we do try to - "sweat the
assets" as they say but certainly some of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.340
this will be replaced.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:32.260
SEAN&gt;&gt; What's it running, would we recognise any of the operating system or any of that?

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.900
It's, yes the; most of the Nodes are running a version

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:45.460
of Linux and the the storage is fairly standard but above

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.160
that we use PBS as our main
scheduler.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.500
SEAN&gt;&gt; How many people might be using this at one time?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.380
At any one time they're probably running hundreds of jobs

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.740
SEAN&gt;&gt; Do they run for a long time? Might they be running years? How does it work?

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.740
We wouldn't have jobs that are run for years but certainly we could have jobs which are

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.620
running for months. Most of the jobs -you
know- we're probably only running for days

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.220
SEAN&gt;&gt; Okay and so when you look at a system like this can you put a figure on how much it costs?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:24.400
Capital cost for a system like this
we're probably talking in terms of about

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.080
one and a half to two million pounds ($2.1m - $2.8m)

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:39.660
The ongoing costs - We have about 250 kilowatts of air conditioning.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.960
When we run this flat out - this particular block here running flat out pulls about 70 kilowatts of power

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.400
and you're drawing that all the time so to
run this whole facility you're talking

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.740
about thousands of pounds just purely in
power costs and then of course they're

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:06.900
all the ongoing licensing and the support for that... So it's not insignificant.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.200
SEAN&gt;&gt; So that's a lot of power is there a big red

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.880
switch somewhere someone has to pull to turn it on?

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.920
Yes there is - and no I'm not going to press it for you

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.000
SEAN&gt;&gt; So its obviously a lot of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.500
equipment and looks like it might be
quite complicated

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.520
does it ever go horribly wrong? Does it ever have big problems?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.560
Generally speaking it is pretty reliable. Individual nodes will fail.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.240
Individual disks will fail but generally speaking the equipment itself is relatively...

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:46.460
...modern computer equipment is inherently reliable - we probably have

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:52.000
more problems with the air conditioning
than we do with the actual compute itself.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.880
SEAN&gt;&gt; So the other thing I was thinking about when when you look at this it's is this

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.050
totally bespoke or is it's like a
template or how does it work in terms of

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.940
how do you buy one of these - How would
you go and buy a high-performance computer?

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:11.660
That's the $64,000 question
basically you have to start to think

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.470
"What do we need it for?" because there is
no one generic high performance compute job.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:26.099
Different departments, different
research, different requirements have

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:31.020
different computing requirements. Some are very very high performance computing you know

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.740
it's a lot of number crunching - others
it's about manipulating data so there's a lot of

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.840
data movement. Other things it's about
visualization.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.780
So you the first thing you've got to do is to say right "What is our mix of jobs?" because the way

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.740
which you set it up for high analytics
is a different hardware set to what you set

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.180
up for vizualization and things like
that. So that's the first thing you've got to do.

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.680
You've then basically got to say okay these are the jobs that we want to run.

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.660
Once you've actually got that you
then go up with a supplier to say right

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:10.540
this is what we want to do, this is how
much money we've got to spend. What can you give us?

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.420
Although this is fairly old now, you know there is still quite a lot

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.659
of life left in here okay it's not cutting edge - but it'll

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.740
still do a lot of the jobs because a lot
of the jobs are purely about number crunching.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.479
This is perfect for that so
basically we will put the new one in - We

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.639
will try and keep as much as we can of
the old one so that that we "sweat our assets "

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.300
and that also means that we've
got additionally capacity for our

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.620
researchers to use as well
and then basically we will then go for a

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:48.120
gradual replacement so as new processors come online and as new research projects

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.940
come you know the balance of the jobs
will change so that means we may have to

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.190
strip out a particular type of node
replace it with a different type of node

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.340
but you know so that will be far more
organic in the future we're not

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:07.650
expecting in the future to do a
complete rip and shred. Unless something

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:13.680
comes up and oh you know we build a new data center - but that's not on the cards at the moment.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.360
The equipment itself is fairly generic, you know, these are standard

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:25.919
blade enclosures. The storage is standard
storage - We have about two hundred and

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.980
forty terabytes in this block here - it's all
connected up by InfiniBand

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.660
SEAN&gt;&gt; Is InfiniBand a speed of network?

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:37.260
It's a standard - This is a 40 gigabit InfiniBand gigabit

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.300
SEAN&gt;&gt; So at home you might have Gigabit - this is 40 of those?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.880
Yes, 40 Gigabit yes - and also of course it's also multi path as well so..

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.039
...because you know there's no point
in doing a lot of calculations if you

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.680
can't then get the result of those
calculations off.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:57.500
There're effectively two types of jobs. There are parallel jobs where you've got a job running on

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:00.810
multiple nodes and then you've got
single node jobs where basically

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:06.100
it's all running on one node. So again, with the parallel jobs you need network

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:09.860
connectivity to make sure you're not processing the same bit twice.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:13.180
SEAN&gt;&gt; So for a researcher or someone who's a

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.760
part of a project what's the big benefit
of doing this rather than letting their

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:20.819
office computer do it? Is it the speed of
compute? It the fact that they can set

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:24.900
it off and come back another day or,
what's the main benefit?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:31.040
Yes it's the capacity.  Because basically the job will start to run it will then

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:36.740
continue to run and then so for example

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.449
Christmas is a very very busy time for
us because a lot of researchers will

00:08:41.449 --> 00:08:46.550
start a job going then come back after
Christmas and pick up the data

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:51.860
As I say, you you could do these things at home, it's just that it would take you

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.320
months or years to do what this can do in days or hours.

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:58.640
SEAN&gt;&gt; Are they 'hot' swappable then?

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.520
Yes they are

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.540
SEAN&gt;&gt; (Joking) Come on then, let's pull one out...

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:04.760
No!

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:09.000
They're all single-phase power but because the phase on this rack is

00:09:09.019 --> 00:09:13.370
different to the phase on this rack
there is the possibility of having a

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:18.560
potential difference of more than 400
volts across the two racks. It's unlikely

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.850
because each of the... but from a "health and safety" point... and it's exactly the

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:28.640
same why you'll see a lot of these have got laser [warning stickers]  because we use laser optics

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.720
SEAN&gt;&gt; For your networking?

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:30.760
Er, yes the fibre...

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.040
SEAN&gt;&gt; And what is that, the aircon?

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.520
Nope, that is the fire suppression

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.120
SEAN&gt;&gt; Oh let's go of a look at that then

00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:44.680
The fire suppression system that we have in here is it's an IG55 system which is an inert gas.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:46.800
It's 50% Argon, 50% Nitrogen

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.800
basically if there is a fire in here all
of the gas in there is released in one go that

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:58.220
replaces about half the atmosphere in here which takes the oxygen level down to

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.380
a point where it doesn't support combustion. It is just about breathable but you wouldn't want to

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:07.040
run a marathon in it you know it's like
trying to run at the top of Mount Everest.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.080
SEAN&gt;&gt; So it suppresses the fire without damaging the kit?

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.060
Yes. The gas is released through these nozzles here.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.320
SEAN&gt;&gt; They look like sprinklers but they're actually gas...

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.020
Gas nozzles, yes.

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:21.240
SEAN&gt;&gt; and how does it work with the cooling? Is it go in hot one side and out
cold the other?

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.200
This is - Yes basically we use aisle

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:27.520
containment so this is the cold aisle when we put cold air

00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.180
in it then goes through the equipment
we'd expect to see a delta T in terms of

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:37.980
20-odd degrees - and on the other side basically it gets vented through...

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.620
SEAN&gt;&gt; So through that glass is going to be 20 degrees warmer? Can we go in? yeah

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.720
OK I think I'd like to spend my time on this side...

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.260
If you come down here you
can definitely feel the temperature difference.

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.560
So these are compute nodes.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.280
SEAN&gt;&gt; ...and how many computers are in each one of those blocks then?

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:08.660
Each one of here so in this particular one you've got 1 2 3 4... ...8 individual blades in this blade enclosure here.

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:12.360
You asked about the big red button? That's the big red button

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.400
SEAN&gt;&gt; That would turn it off and on?

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:15.080
No, that would turn it off.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.640
SEAN&gt;&gt; Ah that's like a "Danger danger!" -
press that?

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.160
Basically if I press that then everything will die immediately

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.100
SEAN&gt;&gt; let's stay away from the big red button then...

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.000
But that is the big red button, yes....

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:30.940
Assuming that they are separate parts of the CPU if we look

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.660
back at our instructions here we execute
instruction 1 it uses the load/store unit..

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:40.730
complicated. The point is what we're doing is by multiplying G by various numbers or

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:45.020
adding it to itself - this point addition -
we're moving around this curve sort of

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.620
seemingly at random
