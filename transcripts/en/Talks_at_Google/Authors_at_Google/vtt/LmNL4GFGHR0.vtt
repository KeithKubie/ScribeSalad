00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.540
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.540
My name's Dave Sparks.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.920
I'm a software engineer on Google Project
Glass.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.020
I'm here to introduce Marty Brounstein, who
I've known for about 12 years now.

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:20.679
I first met Marty when I was managing an RND
center that had some organizational issues.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:23.740
Marty is the founder of the company called
Practical Solutions Group.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:31.029
He has written a number of books on, basically,
organizational effectiveness, and runs a practice

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.270
in training people.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.949
So Marty came in and helped me reorganize
the unit, and basically help our productivity,

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:42.920
things like that.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.870
I was very surprised when Marty approached
me, I guess it was about a year ago, and said

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.719
he'd been working on a new project.

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.710
It wasn't another management book.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.339
By the way, he's written, I think, four or
five--

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.339
&gt;&gt;Marty Brounstein: Seven.

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:00.960
&gt;&gt;Presenter: --seven management books.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.830
Communicating for Dummies and Managing Teams
for Dummies--

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.830
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Coaching.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.830
Mentoring--

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.320
&gt;&gt;Presenter: Yeah, Coaching and Mentoring
for Dummies.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.910
So he's quite an accomplished author already.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.950
But I was rather surprised by the book that
he decided he was going to write.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.920
It's basically a story of a Dutch couple during
World War II in occupied Netherlands who put

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.150
their lives at risk for other people.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.180
So take it away, Marty.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.180
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Okay.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.180
Thank you, Dave.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.700
Yeah, applause, I definitely would appreciate.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.770
[light applause and laughter] Thank you, thank
you.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:41.770
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.770
[audience mumbles]

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.920
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Let me try that again.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.920
&gt;&gt;audience: Good afternoon.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.070
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Get ready to get involved in
an amazing story that I'm going to take you

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.070
through.

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.590
To start this journey into this remarkable
story about two heroes, I want you to be thinking

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.840
about these three questions.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.420
Question number 1: would you be willing to
help others whose lives are in great danger?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.570
Think about that.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.460
Question 2: would you be willing to help others
whose lives are in great danger, knowing that

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.330
if you get involved to help, you'd probably
put your life in great danger?

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.110
Would you still help?

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.520
And question 3: would you be willing to help
others whose lives are in great danger, knowing

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.930
that if you get involved, you'd probably put
your life in great danger, when these people

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.530
who most need that help, most everybody else
wants to either hate them or be indifferent

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.800
to their plight?

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.200
Would you still get involved and help?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.530
[pause]
'Two Among the Righteous Few: A Story of Courage

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.140
in the Holocaust' is a true story about a
Christian couple who answered a definite "Yes"

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.710
to all three of those questions in a time
period when most everybody else said, "No."

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:54.730
And to give this book its just due, I should
say its title is this: [speaks Dutch] That's

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.260
the title of this book translated into Dutch.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.650
As you heard Dave mention, this story takes
place in the Netherlands, commonly referred

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.400
to as Holland, during World War II and the
Holocaust.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.950
This couple I'm referring to are a husband
and wife named Frans and Mien Wijnakker.

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.020
They are true heroes of this story.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.641
Doing something in a climate of hate and indifference
when most people wouldn't get involved, these

00:03:17.641 --> 00:03:20.870
ordinary folks will end up doing extraordinary
things.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.319
I'm going to take you into this story in just
a moment.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:27.099
I'm going to be starting with you, and we'll
see what you know about the greater context

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:29.290
of the history going on at this time period.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.830
Because when you understand that, it's going
to make what they did even look more remarkable,

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.349
because it was.

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.130
I'll also take you into life in Holland during
the war.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.410
Very difficult time period there.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.670
And then I'll be talking to you about who
Frans and Mien Wijnakker are, --who they were,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.820
they're not alive today-- and what they end
up doing that is so heroic.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.069
The last piece I'm going to talk to you about
is I have a personal connection to this story.

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.180
You see, as I pause for a moment here, this
is a story that I stumbled into by accident

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.160
a little over three years ago.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.430
As Dave was telling you, he knows me from
very different things.

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:03.880
This is not part of my normal work.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.880
It wasn't.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.660
It's become, now, a big part of my life.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.550
This story I stumbled into by accident, not
by design.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.489
It's developed over time.

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.590
We can talk about it when I open up the floor
afterwards for your questions about the journey

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.590
of this.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.860
I'm very, very much appreciative when I get
a chance to share this with an audience.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.860
Let's first give a hand.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.970
I want to thank Dave for helping make this
happen, for me today to come here.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.970
[applause]

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:33.300
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Since the book came out, which
is just last fall, today marks my 65th event

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.370
in sharing this story with an audience, of
all sizes, all places.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.870
We've often had, I hope, afterwards, you come
up and talk to us.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.009
Books, Inc. is here to help you if you want
to buy a book, as well.

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:45.870
We've had people come up and be supporters
for us.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:50.789
They've gotten this into their workplace,
or their church, synagogue.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.039
My kids' school, they said.

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.900
I've had some people came up and said, "I'll
host one in my home for you."

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.969
So we've had a variety of that kind of support.

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.389
Others just say, "I'll sign up on your list
and if you have other events, I'll help spread

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:01.389
the word for you."

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.069
If you can help in that way, it'd be most
appreciated, because this is what I keep getting

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:09.379
told by audiences that keeps me going at this:
"You have a special story.

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.379
People need to know it.

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.379
Keep telling it."

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.419
So that's why I'm here.

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:14.050
Well, let me take you into the story.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.789
I'm going to start with helping you understand
the greater context of the history behind

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:19.789
this story.

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.639
We're going to see what you know, here.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:22.749
Quiz today.

00:05:22.749 --> 00:05:23.749
Question 1.

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:25.919
I said the story takes place during World
War II in Europe.

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.180
Well, when does the war in Europe start, and
then finally end?

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.270
[pause]

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.520
&gt;&gt;Male #1: 1939-1945.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.939
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very good.

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:37.889
It started in 1939 and ends in '45.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:39.349
In fact, let's even go more in depth.

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:41.949
When in '39 does it begin?

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:45.130
[pause] You don't lose any points by guessing.

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.130
Yes, go ahead.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.130
&gt;&gt;Male #2: September 1st.

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:48.130
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very good!

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.130
September 1, 1939.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.099
Do you know the event that triggers the start?

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.099
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Kristallnacht.

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.449
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: No, that's before the war.

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:54.979
That would be in November of '38.

00:05:54.979 --> 00:05:56.400
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Germany invades Poland.

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.400
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very good!

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.139
Germany invades Poland.

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.169
The powers to be, Britain and France in particular,
declare war against Germany.

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.229
"Enough's enough, Adolf Hitler, and what you're
doing in Europe here.

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:07.240
The war will now begin."

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.689
Interestingly enough, by the way, just to
help you remember this, if you go back to

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:17.619
the movies, just a year past, 2010 Academy
Award winning movie, The King's Speech.

00:06:17.619 --> 00:06:18.699
Who saw it?

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:19.699
Hey!

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.129
Good, they go to the movies here.

00:06:21.129 --> 00:06:22.129
Good.

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:23.600
Remember the culminating scene in the movie?

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.439
King George is giving that major speech?

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.449
What's he talking about in it? [pause] You
were just worried whether he was going to

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:33.949
stutter or not, but what was he talking about?

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:38.300
[pause] The date of that speech is September
3, 1939.

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.960
That's the formal declaration by Britain.

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.960
That's what he's talking about.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:41.979
"We're declaring war against Germany."

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.339
So in between the stuttering, he did pretty
good that day.

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:45.339
That's what's happening.

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:46.789
This is going to become major.

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.900
But then you said the war then ends in '45
in Europe.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.210
By the way, when in '45?

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.280
You have 12 guesses here.

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280
[laughter]

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.280
&gt;&gt;Female #2: June?

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.280
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: June?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.280
Close, close.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.280
&gt;&gt;Female #3: April?

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.779
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Ah, between you two.

00:06:59.779 --> 00:07:00.779
&gt;&gt;Female #4: May.

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:01.779
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: May, that's it!

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:02.779
Good, good.

00:07:02.779 --> 00:07:03.779
What's that on that game show you can play
there.

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:04.779
Yes, you're very close.

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:05.779
Yes.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:06.779
May '45, it finally ends in Europe.

00:07:06.779 --> 00:07:10.860
August 1945, it will then end in Japan.

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.749
This war in Europe, over five and a half years,
almost six years in total.

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:17.880
This war, World War II, not all that long
ago when you think about it.

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:22.229
A lot of you certainly may have relatives
still alive who were there.

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:27.380
This war, when it's finally over, still true
today, is the most destructive war in humankind's

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.439
history.

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:31.409
Billions of dollars in property damage all
over.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:36.960
55 million people will be killed in this war,
worldwide.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.699
What we had never seen in wars prior, and
we'd seen destructive things in wars before,

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:44.009
more of that death will occur to civilians
than soldiers.

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:45.479
30 million of those will be civilians.

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:48.610
When you think about it, 25 million soldiers
is just humongous.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.210
It's going to even be worse for civilians.

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:52.710
They're going to be caught into this war.

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:56.580
Nearly 2/3 of this death and destruction will
occur in Europe.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.749
There will not be a single country in Europe,
and there's over 30 there, that will not be

00:08:00.749 --> 00:08:04.199
impacted adversely one way or another by this
war.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:07.660
If you're living in Europe during this time
period, your life will become a nightmare

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.610
after September 1, 1939.

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.169
Frans and Mien Wijnakker live in Europe.

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:13.409
You don't want to be there.

00:08:13.409 --> 00:08:17.999
Now, my next question, when we look at the
greater context of this: is this also, this

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:21.919
story takes place during the Holocaust, capital
H. The event.

00:08:21.919 --> 00:08:26.399
But when does the Holocaust start, and finally
end?

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:28.710
&gt;&gt;[Female #5]: 1932?

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.259
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: '32?

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:31.259
Close!

00:08:31.259 --> 00:08:32.570
Very close.

00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.630
1932 was close.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:35.630
She's only one year off.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.630
Big hint.

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:37.630
&gt;&gt;Male #4: '31!

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.630
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Ah, wrong way!

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:39.630
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Wrong way.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:40.630
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: So try again.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.630
[laughter]

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:42.630
&gt;&gt;Male #4: '33.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:43.630
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: 1933.

00:08:43.630 --> 00:08:44.630
We have a winner here.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:45.630
Yes, 1933 it begins.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:46.630
And where?

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.630
&gt;&gt;Male #5: In Germany.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:48.630
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: It begins in Germany.

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:49.630
And it finally ends when?

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.630
&gt;&gt;Male #6: [inaudible]

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:53.009
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: No.

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:54.589
Not quite.

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:57.769
It still was going on after that.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:02.670
1945, actually, May 1945, he was hitting it
right.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.190
When the war finally ends, the Holocaust will
end.

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:07.920
These two events are separate events, but
they're going to intersect.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.240
They'll be happening simultaneously.

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.399
12 years is the Holocaust.

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.680
Actually, it will go in phases.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.910
When you look back over time, the first phase
just begins in Germany, and that's all before

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:21.459
the war.

00:09:21.459 --> 00:09:25.200
Towards the end of the '30s, Austria, as Germany
will annex Austria.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.230
And even towards the very end before the war,
they'll annex Czechoslovakia.

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:33.070
The persecution and then violence will be
happening in this first phase, especially

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:34.889
targeting Jews.

00:09:34.889 --> 00:09:38.720
Then, the second phase becomes the conquering
phase.

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.209
This will start to spread throughout Europe.

00:09:41.209 --> 00:09:42.209
The final phase--.

00:09:42.209 --> 00:09:43.209
And that goes for a couple years.

00:09:43.209 --> 00:09:47.950
The final phase starts late 1941, known as
the Final Solution.

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:49.750
That will be the mass murder phase.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:59.279
For the Holocaust, this systematic, nation-sponsored,
racist effort to persecute, isolate, and mass

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:04.329
murder all these people on Hitler's so-called
list of Undesirables.

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:11.269
When it is finally over, 11 million people
will be murdered through the Holocaust.

00:10:11.269 --> 00:10:12.820
That's more than how many live in the Bay
Area.

00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:16.920
It's a third of the population of the whole
state of California.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.529
[pause] Top of that list of Hitler's so-called
Undesirables?

00:10:19.529 --> 00:10:20.529
Jews.

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:22.740
But they're not the only ones on the list.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.759
But when it's finally over, for Jews, 6 million
there.

00:10:25.759 --> 00:10:28.180
They're 6 of the 11 million.

00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:32.170
That's nearly two out of ever three European
Jews who lived on that continent prior to

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:34.160
this destruction happening.

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.740
If you're part of that group of 11 million,
and you turn to any governments or country,

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:39.740
who's going to help you?

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.740
The answer is--

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:41.740
&gt;&gt;audience: None.

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.740
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: None.

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:46.910
At best, you might find a few individuals
who had the courage and compassion to do the

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.760
right thing, but it was not going to be the
norm.

00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.759
By the way, besides Jews at the top of the
list, who was among those 5 million others?

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:54.759
&gt;&gt;Female #6: Gypsies.

00:10:54.759 --> 00:10:55.759
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very good.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:56.759
Gypsies, yes.

00:10:56.759 --> 00:10:57.759
Who else?

00:10:57.759 --> 00:10:58.759
&gt;&gt;Female #7: Communists.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:10:59.759
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Say again?

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:00.759
&gt;&gt;Female #7: Communists.

00:11:00.759 --> 00:11:01.759
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Communists, definitely.

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:02.759
Oh, Hitler hated them.

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:04.449
Yeah, they were near the top of the list.

00:11:04.449 --> 00:11:05.500
&gt;&gt;Female #8: Homosexuals.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.560
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Homosexuals, yes.

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.620
&gt;&gt;Female #9: Handicapped.

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.620
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Handicapped.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:09.620
Jehovah's Witnesses.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.620
Some Poles.

00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.620
People of Slavic heritage.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:13.079
The list went on.

00:11:13.079 --> 00:11:15.850
He just got stopped before he could continue
going on.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:17.610
That's the Holocaust.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:20.889
If you're on that list, in most cases, people
were not prepared and didn't know what was

00:11:20.889 --> 00:11:21.889
happening.

00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:22.889
It was often, your life is doomed.

00:11:22.889 --> 00:11:24.279
Not a nightmare, doomed.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:27.870
Now, my last major question, when you look
at the greater context of this historical

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.870
effort.

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:31.459
Let's go back into the war.

00:11:31.459 --> 00:11:35.740
What's going on in the war at the point in
time when the United States enters the war.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.709
When does the United States get into the war,
by the way?

00:11:37.709 --> 00:11:39.180
&gt;&gt;Female #10: 1941.

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:40.649
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Just 1941.

00:11:40.649 --> 00:11:41.649
When in '41?

00:11:41.649 --> 00:11:42.649
&gt;&gt;Female #10: December 6.

00:11:42.649 --> 00:11:43.649
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Almost December 6.

00:11:43.649 --> 00:11:44.649
&gt;&gt;Female #10: December 8.

00:11:44.649 --> 00:11:45.910
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes, December 8.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:47.130
Because what happened on December 7?

00:11:47.130 --> 00:11:48.250
&gt;&gt;[Female #11]: Pearl Harbor.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.250
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Pear Harbor.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.580
Japan attacks the United States, a major Naval
base.

00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:56.870
Next day, President Franklin Roosevelt declares
war against Japan with Congress' approval.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.200
Well, Japan is part of the Axis powers with
Germany and Italy.

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.860
Those two countries in Europe turn around
and go, "All right, we're declaring war against

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.060
you, too, United States."

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:06.199
And vice versa.

00:12:06.199 --> 00:12:09.529
The United States is finally going to get
into the war here.

00:12:09.529 --> 00:12:11.810
Worldwide, including Europe.

00:12:11.810 --> 00:12:14.860
We take it late 1941.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.300
Back into Europe.

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.400
What is the situation of the war at this time?

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.500
What do you think?

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:20.500
What's happening?

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.610
&gt;&gt;Female #12: It's bad.

00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:23.380
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Well, it depends what perspective.

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:24.380
Explain.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.380
&gt;&gt;Female #12: Well, for people in France and
the Netherlands.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:26.380
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Definitely.

00:12:26.380 --> 00:12:27.709
France had already been conquered.

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:29.339
&gt;&gt;Female #12: Yeah.

00:12:29.339 --> 00:12:32.050
Britain was barely holding on.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:33.509
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very true.

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:37.699
What's happening in the rest of Europe?

00:12:37.699 --> 00:12:39.560
She's on a roll here, she's getting close.

00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.890
What's happening in the rest of Europe?

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:42.890
Who's winning?

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:43.890
&gt;&gt;Female #13: Germany.

00:12:43.890 --> 00:12:45.120
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Big time!

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.610
They are winning big time.

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:50.550
If you were betting money at this point in
time, bet on the Germans, because you'd be

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:52.089
winning lots of money.

00:12:52.089 --> 00:12:53.139
Almost like winning the lottery.

00:12:53.139 --> 00:12:56.680
In fact, how bad is it if you're not on that
side?

00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:02.250
Well, here's what's left: at this point in
time, by the end of 1941, there were only

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:06.220
two countries left trying to fight against
Germany.

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:11.420
All the rest in Europe have either been conquered,
a few have joined as allies to Germany and

00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:14.879
Italy, and a few were left so-called neutral.

00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:17.459
But they're doing business actively with the
Germans, and hoping that the Germans don't

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:20.459
change their minds and decide to invade them.

00:13:20.459 --> 00:13:21.500
That's the situation.

00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:23.610
Those two who are left, you mentioned one.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:24.610
Who's one of them?

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:26.010
&gt;&gt;Female #14: The United Kingdom.

00:13:26.010 --> 00:13:27.970
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes, the United Kingdom, or
Great Britain.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:29.350
What's their status?

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.189
They've been bombed and battered, as you've
said.

00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:33.690
They're very nervous, they've been very much
shaken.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.570
Winston Churchill's trying to rally them around
British people.

00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:40.589
They're wondering, "When are the Germans going
to invade with forces?"

00:13:40.589 --> 00:13:42.800
Who's the other country left fighting?

00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:43.839
&gt;&gt;Female #15: Russia.

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:45.649
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yeah, what we would call Russia
today.

00:13:45.649 --> 00:13:49.450
Then, it was the bigger unit of the Soviet
Union, Russia being part of it.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.310
What's their status at this point in time?

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:57.259
Well, within six months, during the last half
of 1941, German forces have overrun nearly

00:13:57.259 --> 00:14:00.420
all the European portion of the Soviet Union.

00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.290
They're within 20 miles of the capital of
Moscow.

00:14:04.290 --> 00:14:06.740
The Soviet Union is ready to collapse.

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:07.740
There's life in Europe.

00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:11.879
If you're not on the side of the Germans,
you're life is about to change, and it's going

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:16.490
to turn into a nightmare, including Holland,
which is where I'm going to take you.

00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:19.050
Now, interesting enough, when the war broke
out-- We said September.

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.110
It started in September '39.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.540
The Dutch government said, "We're going to
be neutral.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:25.259
We don't want to be in this."

00:14:25.259 --> 00:14:29.579
And during World War I 20 years earlier, they
had declared neutrality and were left alone.

00:14:29.579 --> 00:14:32.430
Now, the Netherlands is not a big country.

00:14:32.430 --> 00:14:35.010
Take the state of Maryland, add a little bit
more area to it.

00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:36.399
Today, there's over 16 million people.

00:14:36.399 --> 00:14:38.440
It's the most densely populated country in
Europe.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.000
At that point in time, about 9 million.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.860
Fairly densely populated then.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:48.850
The little country to the south of it, Belgium,
said, "Yeah, we're going to be neutral to."

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:52.259
On the eastern border of those countries:
a big country called Germany.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:57.230
Well, interestingly enough, after the war
broke out, nothing happened.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.250
After a month, Poland falls.

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.540
The British and French, who said, "All right,
we're going to declare war against Germany"

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.269
watch Poland go down and go, "Oh, sorry.

00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:04.600
Didn't help a whole lot."

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.699
Then nothing happens for about eight months.

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:12.269
Spring '40, the war will now pick up and go
full rage from that point on.

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:14.100
Sorry, Holland.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:15.199
Your neutrality-- ehh!

00:15:15.199 --> 00:15:16.689
Ptooey to that!

00:15:16.689 --> 00:15:21.480
May 10, 1940: German forces invade the Netherlands.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:25.339
The Dutch, knowing that the neutrality likely
would not be honored, were prepared.

00:15:25.339 --> 00:15:26.339
Troops were ready.

00:15:26.339 --> 00:15:27.339
They put up a stiff fight.

00:15:27.339 --> 00:15:28.339
They lasted--.

00:15:28.339 --> 00:15:29.339
Take a guess.

00:15:29.339 --> 00:15:30.339
How long?

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:32.180
&gt;&gt;Female #16: Five days.

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:33.730
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: What's that?

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.130
&gt;&gt;Female #16: Five days.

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:36.130
I don't know.

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.130
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Five days.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:38.130
We have a winner.

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:39.130
Yes.

00:15:39.130 --> 00:15:40.130
Exactly five days.

00:15:40.130 --> 00:15:41.130
Wow.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.130
Wow.

00:15:42.130 --> 00:15:43.269
Normally-- We've had some audiences-- people
who actually were small children in the Netherlands

00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:44.269
at that time.

00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:45.269
Just had one earlier this week.

00:15:45.269 --> 00:15:48.180
I was at a place and she went, "Five days!"
before I even asked the question.

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.180
She was there.

00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.889
She was a child of seven or eight years old.

00:15:50.889 --> 00:15:52.899
They remember this very much.

00:15:52.899 --> 00:15:55.740
What happened is the week is now starting
to break on.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:58.250
The Dutch are actually putting up a stiff
fight.

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.290
The Germans don't like that, of course.

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.649
They turn to the government and say, "If you
keep fighting, we start bombing.

00:16:03.649 --> 00:16:07.940
We're going to last through one of your major
cities, your commercial port Rotterdam.

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.769
So what do you want to do?"

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:14.689
The prime minister, in consultation with his
Cabinet and the queen there, Queen Wilhelmina,

00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:15.839
go, "You're right.

00:16:15.839 --> 00:16:17.089
We don't want this major destruction.

00:16:17.089 --> 00:16:18.089
We're going to surrender.

00:16:18.089 --> 00:16:20.089
By the way, generals, you surrendered out.

00:16:20.089 --> 00:16:21.089
We're leaving."

00:16:21.089 --> 00:16:24.010
They're going to be a government in exile
in London for the rest of the war.

00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:25.089
"Good luck to you, Dutch people."

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:26.160
And out they go.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.060
By the way, the Germans said, afterwards,
"Sorry.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.189
Miscommunication."

00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:31.279
They bombed Rotterdam anyway.

00:16:31.279 --> 00:16:34.470
30,000 people will die in that.

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:39.430
And life in the Netherlands will begin to
change, because they will become an occupied

00:16:39.430 --> 00:16:42.040
country under Nazi Germany control.

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:44.110
This is where Frans and Mien Wijnakker live.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:48.279
Of all the different countries within Western
Europe, this country, the Netherlands, will

00:16:48.279 --> 00:16:52.480
suffer the most for a five year period of
occupation.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.629
Each year of this occupation, life will get
worse than the year before.

00:16:57.629 --> 00:17:01.410
Right away, the Germans put in charge on of
their own men as a ruling governor.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:05.100
Like Hitler, an Austrian Nazi, a man named
Arthur Seyss-Inquart.

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.771
He'll surround himself with his own henchmen
to run the country.

00:17:07.771 --> 00:17:12.020
In particular, another fellow Austrian Nazi
named Hanns Rauter.

00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:16.941
He will be the one in charge of the security
arm to keep control of the population, the

00:17:16.941 --> 00:17:19.280
SS, as it was known as.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.580
Brutal henchmen.

00:17:20.580 --> 00:17:22.380
Now, life will start to change.

00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:23.750
But not right away.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:26.820
Initially, for the first few months in the
summer of 1940, it seemed quiet.

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.820
It seemed okay.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:31.180
The Germans even seemed nice.

00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:32.890
The Germans were hoping this: "They're Dutch.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:34.030
You're kindred spirit to us.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.140
You're going to be so excited we're here,
you're going to want to join the empire with

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:39.140
us."

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.840
Most of the Dutch said, "No thanks."

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.920
And things will start to change slowly.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.260
But by 1941, it's going to get worse and worse
and worse.

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:51.220
This is what you're going to see happen: four
areas of emphasis in terms of how the Germans

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:54.710
ran this country, typical of many of the countries
they occupied.

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:55.920
1.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:57.540
control the flow of information.

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.970
Well, in those days, unlike today, how did
people get their major news?

00:18:02.970 --> 00:18:03.970
From what sources?

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:05.390
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Newspaper and radio.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.430
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Newspaper and radio.

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:07.430
That's it.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:08.430
Two sources.

00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:09.890
Television: we don't know what that is yet.

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.960
The internet and all its many features: who
had ever thought of that one yet?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:15.140
Where's Al Gore?

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.610
It hasn't happened.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:19.340
So that's not as hard to control.

00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:21.940
Especially newspapers, because they're going
to start censoring the newspapers.

00:18:21.940 --> 00:18:25.420
One of the early underground of resistance
efforts the Dutch do: underground newspapers,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:26.690
trying to get out the real news.

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.590
The Germans want their propaganda to rule
the day.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:34.770
Well, as the war goes on, the Germans don't
like that they think the Dutch are listening

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:40.570
to the radio, because what you start getting
on radio broadcast is broadcasts from London,

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.160
the BBC.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:47.260
And even the Dutch government in exile sets
up its own radio station, Radio Orange.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.670
The Queen starts to come on to give broadcasts
to try to rally the spirits of her Dutch people.

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:57.270
Well, by fall of 1943, the Germans don't like
that they think they'd already issued an edict

00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:58.390
earlier: "Don't listen to your radio."

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.210
Try enforcing that one.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:02.490
They think some of the Dutch are listening
to the radio and they're hearing these news

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.660
because the situation, the war, has started
to change.

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.640
By fall of 1943, the Germans are starting
to suffer defeats.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.050
If you're betting money now, you're losing.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:14.140
They don't want the people to know that.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:19.110
Hanns Rauter, the head of the SS, September
'43, issues an edict across the country: "All

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.510
Dutch, turn in your radios."

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.510
9 million people.

00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:23.510
Good luck trying to enforce that.

00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:25.120
He's even conducting raids in people's homes.

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.240
"I'm going to get your radio."

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.200
Now, some Dutch, and if you know some people
from the Netherlands who fit into this category

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:37.220
of wry sense of humor, complied by doing this:
turning in broken down, non-functional radios.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.750
"Here, take my radio."

00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:41.220
Frans Wijnakker, he's going to keep his radio
hidden.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.970
He didn't always follow the rules so well.

00:19:43.970 --> 00:19:49.990
In addition, as they're running this country,
another area of emphasis was exploit all resources.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:53.760
Well, the Netherlands is fairly well developed
economically.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.120
There's resources to be had.

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.910
Parts, machines, raw materials.

00:19:56.910 --> 00:19:58.810
The Germans are taking it, shipping it off
to Germany.

00:19:58.810 --> 00:20:00.630
Take a guess: for what reason?

00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:02.290
Why do they want that stuff?

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:03.360
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Supply the war effort.

00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:04.360
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: That's right.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.840
Supplying their war efforts.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:09.520
They never had enough of their own materials
to do it, so they're taking from all the occupied

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.520
countries.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.260
Food as well.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:17.840
In addition, as they're exploiting resources,
the biggest resource to exploit: people.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:23.490
During the course of the war, 350,000 people
from the Netherlands have to go work in Germany

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:25.950
in what was referred to as "forced labor."

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:28.120
That's your job.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:29.960
Guess what that labor was being used for?

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.260
&gt;&gt;Female #17: Building the war machines.

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:33.260
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: That's right.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.540
Building the war machines for the Germans.

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:37.080
Working the fields to get the food for the
war machine.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.440
Germans never had enough of their own labor.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.720
Their able bodied young men and women, what
are they doing?

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.950
What are they doing?

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:45.210
&gt;&gt;Male #9: In the military.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.210
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: They're in the military.

00:20:46.210 --> 00:20:48.450
Or-- By the way, there's two wars going on
that people don't often realize.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.560
This is the Holocaust, which we now call later
on the Holocaust.

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.490
They have all this concentration camp stuff
to run.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:56.150
That takes a lot of people.

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.310
Then you've got the military side of it too.

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:02.030
So they don't have enough people, especially
for the labor that they need, so they exploit

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:03.030
from other countries.

00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:08.430
Of the 350,000 people from the Netherlands
who go into forced labor, 30,000 will not

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:11.060
return home alive when the war is finally
over.

00:21:11.060 --> 00:21:12.900
That's not a job assignment you want.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:16.670
Frans Wijnakker, by the way, one of his challenges:
he gets the notice that he's supposed to do

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:17.840
this.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.970
If he does go, everything's going to be doomed
from what he's really trying to do.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.280
It's going to be one of his obstacles he has
to try to overcome.

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:29.030
In terms of exploiting resources people, I'll
add one other example.

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:35.330
The last six months of the war, when the Germans
were starting to really lose, now it's starting

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:36.330
into 1945.

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:39.640
I look, maybe a few younger gentlemen in here
would fit into this category.

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.680
They wanted you.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.340
What do they want?

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.340
What do the Germans want you for?

00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.020
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Join the army.

00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.390
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: That's right.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:47.390
Come join our army.

00:21:47.390 --> 00:21:49.010
By the way, it wasn't "We're recruiting."

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:50.010
No.

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.250
"We're drafting."

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:54.290
Guess who goes into hiding in large numbers
in the Netherlands in the last six months

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:55.290
of the war?

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:57.130
Young men, late teens, early 20s, mid 20s,
boom.

00:21:57.130 --> 00:21:58.430
You'd better go and hide.

00:21:58.430 --> 00:21:59.960
Nobody wants to serve in the German Army.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.900
That's basically a death wish.

00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:02.900
There's life in the Netherlands.

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:05.030
Not a pleasant place to be.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:09.750
In addition, a third area of emphasis in running
this country: stamp out all resistance.

00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:13.410
The Germans did not like resistance of any
form.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.790
Like our country today, if a country came
in and conquered us tomorrow, we're not prepared

00:22:16.790 --> 00:22:17.790
to resist anyone.

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.090
Neither were the Dutch.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:22.000
Slowly, they start to do things on a small
scale.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.980
A protest here or a strike there.

00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:25.700
A little underground newspaper here.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:27.460
It starts to pick up steam.

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.970
But the Germans react very harshly to those
things.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:33.300
"You want to organize a strike, you start
doing it, we're happy to move in forces to

00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.180
crush it, and arrest everybody we can.

00:22:35.180 --> 00:22:39.150
We don't care if we get them all right, we'll
just throw them all in prison."

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:44.200
As it picks up and the Dutch start to do the
underground efforts of hit and run attacks,

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:48.370
sabotage, espionage, many are getting caught.

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:52.230
They try to strike some of the Dutch helpers
to the Germans.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:53.820
Oh, the Germans don't like that.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.780
Mass arrests, sometimes executions.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:02.970
If you strike against one of the German authorities,
the reprisals were most brutal.

00:23:02.970 --> 00:23:08.270
For example, February 1943, one the high ranking
Nazi officials stationed in the country was

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:12.280
in the Hague, the capital, was a man named
Hendrik Seyffardt.

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.160
One night, his doorbell rings.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:15.220
He opens up the door.

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.020
Two Dutch resistance fighters shoot him dead.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:21.460
Hanns Rauter, the head of the SS, hears about
what happened.

00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:27.760
He rounds up 50 people and had them executed
so the public can all know it and see it.

00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.840
This is the beginning of a reign of terror
that the Germans will do throughout the Netherlands

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:35.530
through '43, '44, and '45 until the war finally
is over.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:36.530
There's life.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:39.702
You want to get involved to try to help and
resist, a lot of those people were trying

00:23:39.702 --> 00:23:41.410
to go into hiding once the Germans hear about
it.

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:43.800
It is not a safe place to be.

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.760
Their last major priority in running this
country was this: persecute.

00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.950
Isolate.

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.740
Round 'em up from around the country and put
them into ghettos in the major city, Amsterdam.

00:23:56.740 --> 00:24:01.790
Then deport them on the trains to the death
camps in Poland, the entire Jewish population

00:24:01.790 --> 00:24:02.790
of the Netherlands.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:11.590
Prior to the war, the Dutch Jewish population
was approximately 1 1/2% of the total.

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:14.320
Things started to happen, not all at once.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.930
But before 1940, the year the initial edicts
would come out targeting Jews.

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:23.270
For example, here's one of the early edicts:
all Jews who work in prominent positions,

00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:28.260
and university roles like professors, or in
government, civil service roles, you're out

00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.760
of a job because you're a Jew.

00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.190
Well, there weren't that many Dutch Jews in
those roles at this point in time.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:34.190
But there were a few.

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:37.200
The most prominent was a man named Lodewijk
Visser.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:41.800
His job was equivalent to what we have in
our country today, the job of John Roberts.

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:44.730
Civics lesson: what does John Roberts do in
the United States?

00:24:44.730 --> 00:24:47.960
&gt;&gt;Male #11: He's a Supreme Court Justice.

00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:48.960
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.060
He's a Supreme Court Justice, in fact, yes,
the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.080
That's what was basically Lodewijk Visser's
position.

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:56.320
He's out of a job now, before 1940 is over.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.580
His fellow justices, in response, guess what
they said?

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:01.530
&gt;&gt;Female #18: Nothing.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:02.840
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Correct.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.540
That's what they said.

00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:05.820
Nothing.

00:25:05.820 --> 00:25:09.200
That was the green light for the Germans to
go, "We will continue this because the Dutch

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.070
aren't going to say a whole lot or resist
a whole lot to it.

00:25:12.070 --> 00:25:13.260
Let's go after the Jews."

00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:15.510
It will continue throughout 1941.

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:20.100
The edicts just keep coming out on a monthly
if not a weekly basis that basically take

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.960
the Jewish population and isolate them from
the non Jewish population.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:29.620
For employment, education, cultural and social
life, you've now been removed.

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:34.370
Now, when you start going out into public,
by May 1942, you have to wear this yellow

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.850
badge that identifies you as a Jew.

00:25:36.850 --> 00:25:39.160
The public badge of humiliation.

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:44.090
By July 1942, the trains are now working full
blast.

00:25:44.090 --> 00:25:48.600
The deportations are going and taking the
Jews out of the country to the death camps

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:49.600
in Poland.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:53.570
It will continue for over a year until they
can round up all they can grab.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.590
By the end of September 1943, they've grabbed
as many as they can.

00:25:56.590 --> 00:26:01.660
If you're in that group, the Jews, if you
didn't figure out what's going on, you're

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.660
doomed.

00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:04.500
If you did, you tried to go into hiding.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:05.510
But will anybody help?

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:08.530
That, as I'm going to talk about in a moment,
it will be very challenging.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:12.210
Interestingly enough, too, the Germans were
masters of propaganda.

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:16.420
Often, the early people they were deporting
to the concentration camps and, really, the

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.090
death camps like Auschwitz, Sobibor.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:22.320
When they would arrive, they'd often have
to sign postcards, ready-made postcards.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:24.980
What did the postcards say, in essence?

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:28.700
"Dear friends and family, life at the camp
is not so bad.

00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.380
Yes, you have to work, but it's not so bad.

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.900
We look forward to seeing you soon."

00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:37.230
So the people waiting would receive those
postcards and go, "Oh, okay."

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:41.220
Masters of propaganda to fool people of what
was really going to happen.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.380
There's life in the Netherlands.

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.410
By the way, if you want to be one of those
people that says, "I don't like what's going

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:48.690
on" --because I'm going to talk about what
are the Dutch people doing about this-- and

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:55.380
you want to go help these Jewish friends or
even acquaintances, try to help them hide,

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.040
if you get caught, what happens to you?

00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.850
Take a guess.

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:01.650
&gt;&gt;Male #12: [inaudible]

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.150
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: That's right.

00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:04.150
That's right.

00:27:04.150 --> 00:27:05.910
Or a trip to the concentration camp, free
of charge.

00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.910
You go there too.

00:27:06.910 --> 00:27:08.430
The consequences could be the same for you.

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.890
So who wants to help the Jews?

00:27:09.890 --> 00:27:13.580
[groans] In fact, let's talk about what's
going on with the Dutch population as they're

00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:17.530
watching all this oppression and then persecution
to their fellow Jews.

00:27:17.530 --> 00:27:20.530
We can put those people into four groups.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:27.010
One group, I'll call them "the fearful, but
sympathetic" meaning they feel really bad

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:28.160
about what's going on.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.010
They don't like it.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:33.330
But they don't get involved because--

00:27:33.330 --> 00:27:34.330
&gt;&gt;Male #13: [inaudible]

00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:35.330
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Say again?

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:36.330
&gt;&gt;Male #13: [inaudible]

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:40.010
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Well, it's not only not them,
but back to-- Pardon me?

00:27:40.010 --> 00:27:42.080
"It's too dangerous, I'm too afraid."

00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:43.080
That's why I said the fearful.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:44.080
"Ah!

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.150
Sorry, if you ring my doorbell, I feel bad
for you, but I'm not opening my door.

00:27:47.150 --> 00:27:49.090
I can't help."

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.720
They're mixed in with this other group that
all you can say is a larger number called

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.580
"the indifferent."

00:27:53.580 --> 00:27:56.510
[pause] The indifferent, "I don't care.

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:00.460
I just want to survive this awful war and
just keep my nose down.

00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:02.490
I don't care about what's happening to anybody.

00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:04.060
I'm just trying to survive."

00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:07.820
The indifferent the Germans loved, because
they're actually helping the Germans.

00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:10.770
The Germans found many of the Dutch were very
much compliant.

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.990
For example, you work in the railroad.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.220
You help keep the trains running.

00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:17.820
The Germans love it, because "That's where
we get to ship out the materials we're taking

00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.630
from your country, and ship out the Jews who
we're sending to the death camps.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:22.220
Thanks for your help."

00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.850
Just by doing their jobs.

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.520
You work for the police.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.280
We say, "Help us, we're going to go on a raid."

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:30.160
Okay, you follow orders, you go help round
up people that are your own citizens.

00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.030
You work for the government, oh, the Germans
are big on record keeping.

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.530
"We need to identify who the population is,
keep the records."

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.370
You're just doing your job, helping keep records,
especially who the Jews are.

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:40.370
"Thank you very much."

00:28:40.370 --> 00:28:42.090
You have a lot of that going on.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:43.270
The indifferent.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:48.010
Put the indifferent with the fearful [pause]
and sympathetic, and you know what you have?

00:28:48.010 --> 00:28:51.750
97% of the population, contrary to popular
myth.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:53.760
There weren't a lot who were resisting this.

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:56.580
In fact, the last two groups, small in number,
then.

00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:59.460
I'll put it this way: you can all see that.

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.630
One's a little bit more than the other.

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:02.780
This one's the resistance and its various
helpers.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.970
Frans and Mien Wijnakker would be over here.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.950
But they're less than this group.

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:11.810
This group is "the collaborators and sympathizers
with the Germans."

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:17.030
In fact, what people often don't realize:
Adolf Hitler had a lot of help throughout

00:29:17.030 --> 00:29:19.160
Europe, not just in Germany.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:24.150
In every country, starting in the '30s, there
was widespread fascism and Nazi-like parties

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:25.290
that were forming.

00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.240
The Dutch had it as well.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.360
Prior to the war, the Dutch had their own
little Nazi party called the NSB by its initials.

00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.250
There were maybe about 5000 people in it.

00:29:35.250 --> 00:29:36.330
Not a lot.

00:29:36.330 --> 00:29:39.620
The Dutch, and much still true today, don't
like extremists on the political left or the

00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.080
political right, so they've pretty much looked
at them as extremists.

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:43.080
"Idiots.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:44.080
Ignore them."

00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.110
Well, within a year of the occupation, 100,000
people have now signed up for the NSB.

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:49.110
Why?

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:50.860
Why are they joining?

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:53.550
What do you think?

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.560
&gt;&gt;Male #14] [inaudible]

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.620
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes, they're betting on the
Germans winning.

00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:01.970
It's not so much for safety as for-- because
they want to be on the winning side.

00:30:01.970 --> 00:30:04.870
What do you get if you sign up and join the
winning side to help them?

00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:08.950
Especially if there's been a Great Depression
going on as well?

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.120
&gt;&gt;Male #15: Jobs.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.210
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: You get job opportunities.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:13.370
Loot.

00:30:13.370 --> 00:30:15.620
By the way, when they ship people out, there's
all this loot they take.

00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.220
"We get the good stuff, the Germans, but NSBers,
we'll give you something for helping out."

00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.610
Opportunity, perks.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:26.000
In fact, in many cases, Arthur Seyss-Inquart,
running this country says, "Okay, department

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000
head of the government.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.090
You're not real happy with what I'm going
to do.

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:31.210
That's okay, you can find something else to
do.

00:30:31.210 --> 00:30:32.620
NSBer, come in, take their job.

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.620
Are you qualified?

00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.970
We don't care, you're with us.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:35.970
That's what counts."

00:30:35.970 --> 00:30:40.660
And there's other sympathizers with them who
want to cozy up to the Germans.

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:46.650
As an example, one of the great sympathizers
was the actual prime minister of the country

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:48.190
when the Dutch get conquered.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:50.600
A man named Dirk Jan de Geer.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:53.480
Now, he goes off in exile with the government,
into London.

00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.250
But within five months, the Queen says, "Sorry,
you're out of that job.

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:58.110
I'm getting a new prime minister.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.640
You go off on a diplomatic mission to Indonesia."

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.790
He doesn't do that.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:04.370
Why does she remove him from the job?

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:08.890
Because he keeps preaching, "No, Netherlands,
don't try to cozy up with the Allied forces

00:31:08.890 --> 00:31:10.890
like Britain and the United States.

00:31:10.890 --> 00:31:12.190
Cozy up with the Germans.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.750
Just cooperate with them."

00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:17.431
So he sneaks out when he's supposed to go
to Indonesia and he goes back to the Netherlands.

00:31:17.431 --> 00:31:20.130
The Germans gladly take him because what is
he going to do?

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:23.590
He publishes a pamphlet during the war.

00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:26.470
That's what the pamphlet's saying: cooperate
with the Germans, get along.

00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.280
That's what will be the best for all of us.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.280
Wonderful sympathizer.

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.540
A man of power, here, doing this kind of thing.

00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.800
There were others, obviously not in power,
who would be like, "Maybe I'm not an NSBer,

00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:38.010
but I'm happy to help tattle."

00:31:38.010 --> 00:31:42.170
By the way, when the authorities are trying
to find the Jews who they didn't grab the

00:31:42.170 --> 00:31:46.850
first time who they think went into hiding,
if you helped find out that and report to

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:50.490
the authorities and they come and they get
the person, bonus for you.

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:52.090
Great way to make a little extra money.

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:54.790
That's life in the Netherlands.

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:56.110
Who's going to help?

00:31:56.110 --> 00:32:00.040
Not a lot, because this last group, smaller
numbered, various resistance groups.

00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:02.600
It takes time for many of them to organize.

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.830
One of the problems the Dutch had with their
resistance groups, about a half dozen eventually

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.550
get organized: they weren't united.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.850
[claps] Good luck to you there.

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.190
You're not strong enough together, let alone
individually, to try to do much damage to

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:15.860
the Germans, and often, are not very effective.

00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:20.590
Especially the hit and run, the espionage,
often, they're getting captured.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:21.960
Not working really well.

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:25.630
Of all the resistance groups, one, over time,
becomes quite effective.

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.770
It was called the LO by its initials.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:31.100
Dutch term: Landelijke Organisatie.

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:37.910
English translation: the National Organization
for Helping People in Hiding.

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:41.360
During the course of the war, by the way,
this group was led by a woman, too.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:43.700
Very unusual for that time period.

00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:48.840
By mid 1943, they've really got a national
network going and it's helping.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:53.871
During the course of the war, they will help
give false identity and hide 300,000 people

00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:55.410
from the Germans.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:59.820
But by the time they get involved and do any
help, especially to the Jews who most need

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:01.140
it, it's too late for many.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:05.190
At best, about 35,000 Jews will be able to
get into hiding.

00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:09.130
But over a third will get caught, because
they're always on the most wanted list.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:10.860
A bonus to be had if you get 'em.

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.910
That's life in the Netherlands.

00:33:13.910 --> 00:33:16.620
Frans and Mien Wijnakker, I'll talk about
them in a moment.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.020
They'll end up becoming helpers into this
almost by accident.

00:33:19.020 --> 00:33:24.410
But before I talk about them, I want to tell
you about something that makes them heroic.

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:28.240
Then I'll be explaining why they got this
special recognition.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:32.410
I want to go back to the title of this book
as I do so: Two Among the Righteous Few: A

00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:34.600
Story of Courage in the Holocaust.

00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.981
When this book was being produced last year
by my publisher Tate Publishing out of the

00:33:37.981 --> 00:33:43.130
Oklahoma City area, the person who's job was
to design the book cover called me and said,

00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.700
"I want to understand the significance of
this title, because then I can design a cover

00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.700
accordingly."

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.700
I think she did a great job.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:51.610
I said, "The key word in that title is the
word righteous."

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:55.060
It comes from a place called the Yad Vashem.

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:56.920
Anybody every heard of it?

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.920
Yad Vashem?

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920
Ah, we got a few!

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.920
You know what it is?

00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:02.140
&gt;&gt;Male #16: The Israeli Holocaust Museum.

00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.140
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very good.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.140
The Israeli Holocaust Museum.

00:34:04.140 --> 00:34:05.140
Very good.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:06.140
In Jerusalem, Israel.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:09.639
It was started in 1953, the first of its kind.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:14.220
Today, there's 100+ around the world in various
Holocaust education centers and museums.

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:16.460
Over the years, they've expanded.

00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.770
I've been there twice myself.

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:19.210
It's really quite large today.

00:34:19.210 --> 00:34:20.230
Very moving, very educational.

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:22.550
They get about a million visitors a year.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:27.320
Well, there's a section within the museum
called the Righteous Among the Nations.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:34.100
In support of that, the people who have gotten
that very special honor, they have plaques

00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:36.790
in trees planted on the grounds all around
the museum.

00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:39.030
That's referred to as the Avenue of the Righteous.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.129
Well, who are these righteous?

00:34:41.129 --> 00:34:42.770
What does this honor mean?

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:48.240
Those are people, non Jews, who, during the
course of the war and the Holocaust risked

00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.080
their lives to help save the lives of Jews.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.080
True heroes.

00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:55.710
Some of them lost their life trying to help.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.070
Among the most notable of the Righteous Among
the Nations, people are often aware of because

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.070
of the movies.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:01.990
1993 Academy Award winning movie?

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:03.830
&gt;&gt;Female #19: Schindler's List.

00:35:03.830 --> 00:35:04.830
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Very good.

00:35:04.830 --> 00:35:06.610
Schindler's List, in honor of Oskar Schindler.

00:35:06.610 --> 00:35:10.109
He is one of the righteous, well deserved.

00:35:10.109 --> 00:35:12.630
Frans and Mien Wijnakker are two Oskar Schindlers.

00:35:12.630 --> 00:35:15.700
They, too, will eventually get this honor.

00:35:15.700 --> 00:35:17.540
It usually comes years after.

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:22.960
For them, it came late 1983, when Yad Vashem
recognized their heroic acts.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.240
At that point in time, Mien, the wife, had
already passed away.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:26.910
She dies in 1980.

00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:30.060
Frans is still living, so he's there to accept
this special honor.

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:33.340
He'll live all the way to 1994, almost the
age of 86.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.870
Well, what did they do to earn this special
honor?

00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:38.520
Let me focus in on that with you.

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:43.530
In fact, when this war breaks out, they're
just a young married couple.

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.780
Frans, at this point in time, just a little
over age 30.

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.100
Mien's a few years younger.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:51.730
They live in the southeastern portion of the
Netherlands in an area of small towns and

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:54.290
villages, unlike the rest of the country that's
more urbanized.

00:35:54.290 --> 00:35:57.070
They're just trying to get through the war.

00:35:57.070 --> 00:35:59.960
What's important in their life at this point
in time is really three things.

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:00.960
1.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.190
Raise a family.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:08.020
By the end of 1942, they have four small children
under the age of five.

00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.020
Trying to raise a family.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:11.060
Anybody, any parents in the room here?

00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:12.470
Can you imagine that?

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.540
That's hard enough in itself, and then you
got a war on top of it.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:16.970
That's their life: raise the kids.

00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:18.670
I want to be a good family, here.

00:36:18.670 --> 00:36:21.940
They play the traditional roles which was
common in that time period.

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:23.410
Mien, you run the household.

00:36:23.410 --> 00:36:25.710
Frans, you go work and support your family.

00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:27.110
He's a semi-skilled laborer.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:29.700
Works at a grain mill the town over.

00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:32.620
Many people in that area, that's what they
were: laborers, farmers.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.820
Not a lot of high educated people in the area
at this time period.

00:36:35.820 --> 00:36:36.820
That's life.

00:36:36.820 --> 00:36:37.820
Work hard, support your family.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.950
And finally, what's important to them?

00:36:39.950 --> 00:36:42.530
Be good Catholics.

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:47.120
Unlike today in Europe, and one might even
argue in the United States as well, then,

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:50.000
the role of the Catholic church and Protestant
faiths in other parts of the country were

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.220
very dominant in many people's lives.

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:53.220
Especially in their area.

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:54.960
In their area in particular.

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:55.960
Small town area.

00:36:55.960 --> 00:37:00.950
The local parish priest was a huge authority
figure, beyond just the walls of the church.

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:02.700
What he said you do, you do.

00:37:02.700 --> 00:37:04.520
What he said you don't do, you don't do.

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.980
You make sure you go to church every Sunday,
and go to confession as well.

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:10.840
That's their life: be good Catholics, raise
your family, work hard.

00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:11.930
That's it.

00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:12.930
Ordinary folk.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:16.770
Well, after the war broke out, a short time
later, Frans takes a leave of absence from

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.120
his job at the mill.

00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.740
He decides he can make a little bit more money
by taking Mien, and exiting, get in the countryside

00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:27.050
here, and travel on the train to the major
cities-- two hours to Amsterdam, two hours

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:31.020
to the Hague-- and sell the food to people
there where food is in great need, especially

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.020
good food like that.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.860
He starting to build up a little business.

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:35.970
He's a pretty good salesman.

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:36.970
This is going on for him.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:38.900
It's not doing too badly.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.190
Spring 1943.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:43.280
He's on one of these business calls one day.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.470
Whoops, got a question there?

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.610
&gt;&gt;Male #17: [inaudible]

00:37:49.610 --> 00:37:52.750
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Pardon me?

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:59.830
&gt;&gt;Male #17: Basically the question was: were
the Nazis Catholics or any particular religion?

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:04.530
Many individuals had religion, but as a practice,
if you're part of the Nazi Party, religion

00:38:04.530 --> 00:38:06.270
played no role in your life.

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:07.270
Not at all.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.810
Let me go back to where I am in the story
here.

00:38:09.810 --> 00:38:12.210
Frans, spring 1943.

00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:14.770
As I said, he was on one of these business
calls.

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.020
He's in Amsterdam.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:19.760
He's calling upon this doctor acquaintance
he's done business with before.

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:24.250
As he's doing the business there, the doctor
turns and says, "Would you be willing to help?

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:28.600
You see, there's this young girl we have hiding
here in the city right now.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:31.750
We'd love to get her out to the countryside
where the German presence is obviously much

00:38:31.750 --> 00:38:32.750
less.

00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:33.750
You live somewhere in the countryside.

00:38:33.750 --> 00:38:34.750
What's the town?"

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.750
"Dieden."

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:36.750
"Yeah, Dieden, okay.

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:37.750
Maybe you take her for three weeks.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:39.480
She'll get a little fresh air, a little better
food.

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.240
Oh, by the way, she's Jewish.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:44.230
Would you be willing to help?"

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:45.760
Frans went, "Okay!"

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.100
Not exactly knowing what he's getting into,
but he is now starting into a new venture

00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:50.520
in his life.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.440
Before that day is over, he meets this girl.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.140
She's actually 14, but because of her small
stature, he thinks she's 12.

00:38:57.140 --> 00:39:02.060
He only knows her by her false Dutch identity
name, Freetje.

00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:05.030
By the time he gets home with Freetje on the
train, it's almost midnight.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:08.870
No cell phones in that day, so he couldn't
call Mien and say, "Hey, I'm going to be late

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:09.870
tonight."

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:10.870
She's worried, but there he finally arrives.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:11.870
He says, "Hey, we've got this girl.

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:12.870
We're going to keep her for three weeks."

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.800
Mien's reaction was, "Well, okay, let's get
her to bed."

00:39:15.800 --> 00:39:17.460
The new business has just begun.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.230
Now, who's Freetje?

00:39:19.230 --> 00:39:22.720
Freetje was actually a German Jewish girl.

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:26.670
She and her siblings are able to get out of
Germany at the end of 1938.

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:27.670
Someone mentioned Kristallnacht.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:29.461
Kristallnacht had happened a short time before.

00:39:29.461 --> 00:39:32.610
The massive rampage against the Jews in Germany.

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:36.360
Life was taking a turn for the really worse.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:42.210
Dutch were willing to take in a few thousand
what they call "unaccompanied children."

00:39:42.210 --> 00:39:43.210
Children, not families.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:44.590
They'll never see their parents again.

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.640
They'll get placed within Dutch Jewish homes
within Amsterdam.

00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.320
Life, for a couple years, will go on.

00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.090
She's going to learn Dutch right away, go
to school.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:54.040
Life's not so bad, other than that you don't
have your parents.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040
But she gets to see her siblings.

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040
She gets to meet new friends.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.550
In fact, one of the friends that she had,
among others, that just lived down the block

00:39:58.550 --> 00:40:04.280
from her was a girl of a similar age, who
was also German Jewish background as well.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.170
But her whole family will get out, because
they got out in the early '30s and made life

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:08.290
in Amsterdam.

00:40:08.290 --> 00:40:12.650
That family will try to stay hiding in Amsterdam,
where the German presence was the greatest.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:13.830
They don't get out.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.390
Luckily, Freetje does.

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:18.850
This girl, by the way, her friend I'm talking
about: a girl named Anne Frank.

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.710
Well, as you might guess, Freetje's going
to stay longer than three weeks.

00:40:21.710 --> 00:40:25.150
In fact, within a short time after she's arrived,
Mien goes to Frans one day and says, "You

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.240
know what?

00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.240
Freetje's Jewish!

00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240
Did you know that?"

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:29.240
"Yeah, I knew it."

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:31.970
"Well, she's been telling me she's got a younger
brother also in hiding in Amsterdam.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:33.090
This is where he's located.

00:40:33.090 --> 00:40:34.090
Go get him."

00:40:34.090 --> 00:40:36.170
Zoom, on the train, brings him home.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:38.080
Now there's two kids in their home.

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.260
Two Jewish children on top of their four kids.

00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:43.760
But these two were refugees, and they're dangerous
to have.

00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.822
The new business is starting to roll.

00:40:44.822 --> 00:40:48.760
In fact, a short time later, some acquaintances
who had heard about this Frans Wijnakker,

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.690
these two older women, come on the train and
deliver to him a 17 year old girl and say,

00:40:52.690 --> 00:40:53.690
"Hey, would you take her in?"

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:55.500
Frans and Mien go, "Yes, we'll take her."

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:59.540
Now there's three Jewish children who are
basically refugees.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.590
The new business is starting to really pick
up.

00:41:01.590 --> 00:41:04.680
Before long, a stranger shows up one day.

00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.290
Initially, Frans is a little suspicious, because
he's asking questions.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.840
He seems to know that he's got children in
his home.

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.640
How does he know this?

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.640
He's from the LO.

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.869
Remember that resistance organization that
helps people in hiding?

00:41:15.869 --> 00:41:20.100
Likely, that doctor acquaintance in Amsterdam
was also part of the LO.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.060
They started to figure out whatever people
we can help left, especially the Jews, who

00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:26.619
most of them have been caught, who are in
the cities, if we can get them out to the

00:41:26.619 --> 00:41:28.410
countryside, better chance to keep them hidden.

00:41:28.410 --> 00:41:33.220
So this gentlemen, goes by a code name, starts
to explain this to Frans.

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:34.220
"Would you be willing to help?"

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.320
Mien comes into the conversation.

00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:37.270
Yeah, there could be dangers in here.

00:41:37.270 --> 00:41:39.960
"We're trying to get the remaining Jews out
first.

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.190
Would you be willing to help find places for
more in the area, take a few more in your

00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:45.060
house, whatever you can fit?"

00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.710
Frans and Mien look at each other and go,
"Okay."

00:41:47.710 --> 00:41:52.270
Not exactly knowing what they're getting into,
but this new business now is full blast.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.660
Now, Frans will become a broker.

00:41:54.660 --> 00:41:59.490
As people come in and out, refugees, and he's
helping them from all ages, children to adults

00:41:59.490 --> 00:42:01.670
to older adults.

00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:04.790
He's going around, different acquaintances
throughout the small town area and go, "Hey!

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:07.810
Would you take somebody in hiding?" and often
would tell the story: "Well, the war displaced

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.260
people from their homes" or "It wasn't good,
someone got sick.

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:11.260
Could you take them in?"

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:14.490
Because in many cases, he didn't want to say,
"By the way, they're Jewish."

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.330
Because more non Jews were helping non Jews
hiding than helping Jews.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:19.720
Everyone he's helping were Jews.

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.280
Total strangers to him.

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.280
That's what he would be doing.

00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.830
Seeing if he could get people-- "And by the
way, we could pay you a little money for it,

00:42:24.830 --> 00:42:25.830
too."

00:42:25.830 --> 00:42:28.530
So he's getting people to help out, one by
one.

00:42:28.530 --> 00:42:31.960
The challenges now start to pick up in this.

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.119
They certainly learned.

00:42:34.119 --> 00:42:35.750
Shortly after both Frans and Mien go, "Uh-oh.

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:39.500
This is dangerous and there are numerous challenges."

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.610
For example, one of the most common ones you'd
hear, the term would be "betrayed", meaning

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.440
the person we have in our home.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.220
"They've been exposed.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.710
We think people know about it.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.740
The authorities come to get them, of course,
Frans, they're going to come to get us.

00:42:52.740 --> 00:42:53.740
We're going to be doomed.

00:42:53.740 --> 00:42:54.740
We've been betrayed.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:55.740
Get them out of here!"

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:57.150
Then there'd be the mad scramble to find another
place.

00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:59.890
Take them into another house temporarily.

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:02.140
He's dealing with this a lot.

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.520
There are numerous other challenges.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:08.170
When I reflect back on the challenges and
dangers that they ended up having to deal

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:12.780
with and face, I am stunned that they persisted.

00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:16.990
Because most people, like us, we would have
quit and ran fast.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.720
But they had the courage and compassion to
continue.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.130
Let me tell you just one other challenge among
many.

00:43:21.130 --> 00:43:26.170
It deals with the first adults they take into
hiding in their own home.

00:43:26.170 --> 00:43:30.730
First adult they took in, was around the fall
of 1943, was a gentleman named Lou.

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:32.950
He's a architect by trade.

00:43:32.950 --> 00:43:36.060
He was already in hiding in Amsterdam, was
able to sneak out and come into the home of

00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:37.490
Frans and Mien.

00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:41.880
Luckily, his trade was very helpful, because
he will help design and build within the Wijnakker

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.690
home a hiding room.

00:43:43.690 --> 00:43:47.810
By 1944, when the German presence starts to
increase in their area, that's going to be

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.930
very valuable to have.

00:43:49.930 --> 00:43:54.390
But Lou, similar in age to Frans, is not with
his wife.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.990
She got out from Amsterdam a little bit later,
a short time afterwards.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.700
Unbeknownst to Frans-- I mean, excuse me,
unbeknownst to Lou, Frans actually placed

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:02.920
her nearby.

00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.540
They often didn't want young married couples
together.

00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:08.110
His wife, Angelien, is at a place for about
a month.

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:11.840
Then she gets betrayed, gets sent out in the
middle of the night and say, "Go find the

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:12.840
house of Frans and Mien Wijnakker.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:14.280
I think it's over here."

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.210
Luckily, she's able to find it without getting
caught.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:19.870
Then has an emotional reunion with her husband
Lou.

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.130
Great.

00:44:21.130 --> 00:44:22.310
Frans and Mien say, "Welcome.

00:44:22.310 --> 00:44:23.730
We can keep you here."

00:44:23.730 --> 00:44:28.050
But a short time after arriving, Angelien
says, "I have a secret I can't keep secret

00:44:28.050 --> 00:44:29.440
any longer.

00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:31.560
I'm pregnant."

00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:32.820
How are you going to have a baby under these
conditions?

00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.080
These are not normal conditions.

00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.210
What are you going to do about that?

00:44:36.210 --> 00:44:39.260
In fact, one of the choices: send her away.

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:40.910
This is just among many of the challenges.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.500
You can see where they get this award, righteous
among the nations, in years later.

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:50.530
Because, when this is finally over, and all
these dangers all around them, when the liberation,

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:55.050
almost after their nearly two year effort,
they will save the lives of at least two dozen

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.350
Jews from certain death.

00:44:56.350 --> 00:44:58.390
And nobody will get caught.

00:44:58.390 --> 00:45:00.119
You can see why they're true heroes.

00:45:00.119 --> 00:45:04.080
The last piece, before I open up to more questions,
is I mentioned at the beginning I also have

00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.560
a very personal connection to this story.

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:10.970
I'm going to read you a little excerpt from
the book to give you some insight into that.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:15.191
Let me set up the piece I'm about to read
by first introducing my number 1 supporter

00:45:15.191 --> 00:45:17.100
in this special journey I've been going on.

00:45:17.100 --> 00:45:18.720
It happens to be with me today.

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:20.440
It happens to be my wife, Leah Baars.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.440
Here she is.

00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.440
[applause]

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes, please.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:28.090
[applause continues, then ends] Well, my wife
Leah, and her family, are actually immigrants

00:45:28.090 --> 00:45:30.160
from the Netherlands themselves.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:33.330
They moved to the United States when she was
just shy of 14.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.340
They moved to LA.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.240
She takes to American television right away.

00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.240
Her mother will worry what's going to happen
with her.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.411
But actually, surprising her mother, she goes
on to UCLA and graduates from there, then

00:45:42.411 --> 00:45:46.750
moves up here to the Bay Area, ends up having
a wonderful career as a school psychologist,

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:49.350
raises two young adult daughters today.

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.170
A little bit later in life, picks me up.

00:45:51.170 --> 00:45:53.260
We've been married a little over five years
now.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:57.130
Well, it's spring 2009.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:01.630
She has not been back to her original homeland
now for 25 years, because life got in the

00:46:01.630 --> 00:46:02.630
way.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:04.610
If you've ever lived somewhere else, you have
those roots.

00:46:04.610 --> 00:46:05.980
That often has a very emotional pull.

00:46:05.980 --> 00:46:08.310
She'd been talking with me for a while, and
I've never been.

00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:11.520
"We need to do a special trip and go and spend
some time there."

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:16.170
Spring 2009, we go for a six week trip traveling
throughout the Netherlands.

00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.100
Along the way, we stumbled into something
by accident that I thought was so significant

00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:24.340
that I end up writing a letter to her two
daughters, because I thought it would be important

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.340
to know.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:27.670
That's the piece I'm going to read you about
here.

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:29.300
One last thing before I do that.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:33.600
If you knew my wife Leah as a child in the
Netherlands, you didn't know her by the name

00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600
Leah so much.

00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.460
You knew her more by her Dutch nickname Ineke.

00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:40.390
Please keep that in mind as I read this piece.

00:46:40.390 --> 00:46:44.120
"Chapter 1: Historic Moment.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:51.020
Dear Shoshana and Alana" -- that's her two
daughters-- "Today is Tuesday, May 26, 2009.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:54.369
I'm writing to share more than just travel
stories from the wonderful journey your mom

00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:55.760
and I are having.

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:59.060
I want to document something to you that I
hope you will find of much value for your

00:46:59.060 --> 00:47:01.060
own family history.

00:47:01.060 --> 00:47:05.340
While I know some of the history, and you
probably do too, coming in contact with the

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:09.850
reality of it merges mind and heart into something
of great significance.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:11.570
I will explain shortly.

00:47:11.570 --> 00:47:16.460
Being in the Netherlands, much more than in
the United States, one is reminded of World

00:47:16.460 --> 00:47:18.490
War II and the Holocaust as well.

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:22.440
When we started our trip in Amsterdam, we
visited the Anne Frank house.

00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:25.660
It is a wonderful educational museum.

00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:30.109
Last Friday, we visited the museum in sight
of Camp Westerbork.

00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:34.850
Before World War II, there were 140,000 Jews
who lived in the Netherlands.

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:38.850
107,000 perished during the Holocaust.

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:43.350
Westerbork was the deportation center the
Nazis used to ship the Dutch Jews off to the

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:45.650
death camps in Poland.

00:47:45.650 --> 00:47:49.870
We arrived last evening in the city of Eindhoven
in the south of the country.

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:54.230
Of the places your mom's family lived prior
to immigrating to the US, Eindhoven was where

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:56.190
they were the longest.

00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:59.150
Before arriving there yesterday, we stopped
in an old town named Ravenstein.

00:47:59.150 --> 00:48:04.430
It is the big small town in an area of villages
in the southern section of the country.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:10.640
It is also near where your grandparents, Opa
and Oma, were hidden during the war.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:15.470
As we stop and walk around the charming 1600s
historic downtown of Ravenstein, all two blocks

00:48:15.470 --> 00:48:19.350
of it, we spot a tourist information office.

00:48:19.350 --> 00:48:23.580
We go in, and your mom asked the staff members
about the location of an old church in the

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.280
nearby small town of Dieden, and if the home
that once belonged to Frans Wijnakker is still

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.650
next to it.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:34.119
For the older folks in this area, which the
three office people on hand were, the name

00:48:34.119 --> 00:48:36.920
of Frans Wijnakker is a notable one.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:41.710
They tell your mom not only how to get to
this church, but also that one of the Wijnakker's

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.480
sons still lives in this particular house.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:46.690
So off we go, down the road, to Dieden.

00:48:46.690 --> 00:48:50.440
About ten minutes later, we find the church
in question.

00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.420
We park our car at the old church and walk
over to the house next door to it.

00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:56.620
The house has a long driveway.

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.690
As we walk up the driveway, we see a few people
sitting at a table in the front yard on this

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:01.990
warm day.

00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:06.860
We see the world "Shalom" written on the front
side of the house, probably a foot in side.

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:10.900
Your mom boldly walks up to the gentleman
sitting there and says in Dutch, "Hello, I'm

00:49:10.900 --> 00:49:11.900
Ineke Baars."

00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:14.820
A roar goes up along with a warm handshake.

00:49:14.820 --> 00:49:20.440
This man, and his wife sitting with him, know
who Ineke Baars is, and much more, the significance

00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:21.440
related to her.

00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:25.880
In the next few minutes, the Dutch starts
flying and phone calls start happening.

00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:30.420
Within ten minutes, his youngest sibling,
Irene drives over and joins in this lively

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.540
discussion.

00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.359
The man who has greeted us is Frans Wijnakker,
Junior.

00:49:35.359 --> 00:49:39.090
He's the youngest son of the aforementioned
Frans Wijnakker.

00:49:39.090 --> 00:49:46.119
His father Frans, with the support of his
mother Mien, saved your grandparents and your

00:49:46.119 --> 00:49:50.880
mom, baby Ineke, during World War II.

00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:55.360
They all survived the Holocaust because this
Catholic man and his wife hid them and other

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:57.450
Jews, and helped even more hiding from the
Nazis.

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.320
Do you recognize the significance of this
moment?

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:05.540
Frans' son and his wife, also named Irene,
visited Israel themselves last year.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:10.960
They showed us a blown up picture of the memorial
plaque and tree planted in Yad Vashem's Avenue

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.530
of the Righteous section in honor of their
parents, which is when the historic significance

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:18.410
of what I was witnessing really hit me.

00:50:18.410 --> 00:50:22.510
After visiting for over an hour, they've invited
us to come back Wednesday evening.

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:26.130
They have three other siblings who are all
alive and live in the local area.

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:31.700
Your mom will likely meet more of the Wijnakker
who she has not seen in 25 years."

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.210
[pause]
I'll open up the floor to your questions,

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:36.210
comments.

00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:41.570
&gt;&gt;Male #18: I just have a question, in your
story- telling, it seems like a quite easy

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:44.580
decision for those couples to help those Jewish
people.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.780
But I guess in such a situation, it's quite
dangerous.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:51.780
It's actually a huge decision to make to help
them.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:58.060
What do you think is the force or the motivation
to make the decision to help so many Jewish

00:50:58.060 --> 00:50:59.060
people?

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.630
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes, great question here.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:04.320
As you can hear as I told it, and you would
get the same thing if you read this more in

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.850
depth, is they stumbled into this by accident.

00:51:07.850 --> 00:51:12.360
But there was things thinking that Frans had
and Mien definitely along with him that said,

00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.970
"People are asking for help.

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:16.100
That's a Dutch thing to do.

00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100
You help."

00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:19.890
That wasn't a Dutch thing to do, as we find
out.

00:51:19.890 --> 00:51:22.460
But there was just that thing of "People are
asking for help."

00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:27.220
We even heard, years later, as we now know
the family, the siblings, that he always wanted

00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:29.290
to make a difference in his life in some way.

00:51:29.290 --> 00:51:30.430
So it was like this.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:31.800
But it's almost like they stumbled into it.

00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:34.380
And they don't realize it at first.

00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:38.920
Along the way, they get scared, even, and
almost back away, but then they don't.

00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.359
They'll continue.

00:51:40.359 --> 00:51:41.700
But they definitely get challenged.

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:46.880
But there's a moral fiber and character that
you can see come out that you don't always

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.910
know the why, you have to draw your own conclusions,
but at least it came through.

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.240
Thank God it did.

00:51:51.240 --> 00:51:52.470
Great question, thank you.

00:51:52.470 --> 00:51:53.710
What is your name?

00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:54.710
&gt;&gt;Female #20: Rachel.

00:51:54.710 --> 00:51:55.710
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Rachel.

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:58.840
&gt;&gt;Female #20: What happened when you came
back from that visit with the family that

00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840
Wednesday?

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:00.840
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Ah, great question, Rachel.

00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:01.840
&gt;&gt;Female #20: Thank you.

00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:02.840
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Thank you very much.

00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:03.840
Great question.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:06.050
As you finish reading here, it's a Monday.

00:52:06.050 --> 00:52:07.500
We stumbled into this area by accident.

00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.020
The Wijnakker family know who Ineke Baars
is.

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:13.920
This is Ineke Baars right here, folks.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.580
They started juts talking to their other siblings
and who can come.

00:52:16.580 --> 00:52:17.580
You can imagine that.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.420
Somebody who you have not seen in 25 years
shows up.

00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:24.190
You get a call from maybe a sister or brother
that says, "Hey, can you come over tomorrow

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:25.460
night?"

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:27.490
Most of us would say, "Oh, I'm busy, I've
got this going on.

00:52:27.490 --> 00:52:28.490
I'm sorry.

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:30.430
Give my regards."

00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:36.420
Because they heard Ineke Baars was in town,
all five siblings come, bringing their spouses

00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.570
with them.

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.640
They're excited to see her.

00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.510
The last time she had been there, I said it'd
been 25 years.

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.260
It was the summer of 1984.

00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:50.420
She traveled from San Francisco, with then
her oldest daughter who was five, to go visit

00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:57.660
Frans Wijnakker, who was still alive, because
the local area had heard about this special

00:52:57.660 --> 00:53:00.750
honor he gets from Yad Vashem, Righteous Among
the Nations.

00:53:00.750 --> 00:53:04.840
So they throw a parade for him, to say, "Here's
really a local hero."

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:06.170
Now they recognize that.

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.170
Who's in the parade?

00:53:07.170 --> 00:53:08.170
Ineke Baars.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.600
But then, as the years go by, life got in
the way.

00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:12.910
This has been a happy reunion.

00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:15.990
We are still in touch with the family today,
which has been a nice part of the journey.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:18.310
So thank you for your question.

00:53:18.310 --> 00:53:23.231
&gt;&gt;Male #19: How do we take the lessons we
learned from the dark period and apply it

00:53:23.231 --> 00:53:24.231
to the world today?

00:53:24.231 --> 00:53:25.410
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Good question, good question.

00:53:25.410 --> 00:53:28.700
Let me throw it back to all of you.

00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:30.030
What lessons can you take?

00:53:30.030 --> 00:53:32.220
How can you apply it to your life today?

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:33.220
From this story.

00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.220
It's a great question.

00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:37.180
Let me hear a few of your thoughts, and I
can offer a thought as well.

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:41.780
&gt;&gt;Male #20: I think all state [indistinct]
like the government and other entities should

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.240
take minority oppression very seriously.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:51.240
Whenever any country moves towards minorities'
oppression or at least has tendencies towards

00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:56.100
that, I think countries react very forcefully
to arrest that trend.

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:00.110
I think that's the lesson, because that can
actually get bigger and much worse if you

00:54:00.110 --> 00:54:01.820
leave it.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:04.359
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yeah, that's a very good point.

00:54:04.359 --> 00:54:08.660
In essence, too, and I've often had people,
to your great question here, speak up, going,

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.470
"Do I have that courage to speak out when
I see something going wrong?"

00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:13.470
Discrimination, oppression.

00:54:13.470 --> 00:54:15.180
Because those things are happening.

00:54:15.180 --> 00:54:16.760
Sometimes we don't notice them.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.450
It's easier to get caught up in our good life
and not see it.

00:54:18.450 --> 00:54:22.460
That's one of the lessons people will often
comment as, "Can I speak out, whether our

00:54:22.460 --> 00:54:23.790
government will do anything or not?

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.580
Can at least I speak out and say something
and try to help?"

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.300
Definitely is a great lesson you can take
away from this story.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.300
Others?

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:33.790
Other thoughts on that?

00:54:33.790 --> 00:54:38.670
[pause] Let me throw one to you, and I want
you to comment.

00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:42.920
One of the things, and this has been the neat
part of, I've talked about this in a variety

00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:44.460
of venues as I've shared this story.

00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:48.250
But in workplaces in particular, what I'm
being asked often to emphasize: this story

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:50.940
is a story of ethics.

00:54:50.940 --> 00:54:52.120
How's this a story of ethics?

00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:53.180
What are ethics?

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.590
What do you think?

00:54:54.590 --> 00:54:58.110
&gt;&gt;Male #21: It's the sense of doing the right
thing.

00:54:58.110 --> 00:54:59.110
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Uhuh.

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:00.640
I think you can take down your life every
day.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.540
How do you treat people?

00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:04.280
You get sometimes challenges in life.

00:55:04.280 --> 00:55:05.890
You could get away with doing it dis--.

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:07.360
Is that the right thing?

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:12.180
I think most people, in my experience, they
know deep down what's right and what's not.

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.320
These people not only were able to do that,
they did it with their life at risk.

00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.240
How many of us are willing to do that?

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.200
We don't usually have that pressure, thank
goodness.

00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.680
But can we know right from wrong?

00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.930
For those of you who are parents in the room,
are you teaching that to your children?

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:26.180
Those are definitely stories.

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:29.750
I think that one of the neat things is we've
got reacquainted and me, acquainted, with

00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:30.750
the Wijnakker family.

00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:33.390
You can see with all five of the siblings
there is a moral character.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:35.170
You know their parents passed it on to them.

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.200
They think it's important to care about other
people.

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:43.420
One of the messages from the story: can you
care about people beyond yourself?

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.510
Just in doing your job.

00:55:44.510 --> 00:55:46.380
Team members you work with.

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.470
If you can, you can be a valuable team member.

00:55:49.470 --> 00:55:51.890
Let alone a parent, person in the community.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:52.890
There's all those opportunities.

00:55:52.890 --> 00:55:53.890
Great question.

00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:54.950
Thank you for that.

00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:58.260
Let me take a couple more here before we'll
wrap up.

00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.260
Got one?

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:00.260
Please.

00:56:00.260 --> 00:56:01.470
&gt;&gt;Male #18: Can I ask one more?

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:05.090
I remember you mentioned three things about
the couple.

00:56:05.090 --> 00:56:10.660
One is they are just ordinary southern couples,
and they have four children.

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:13.640
You also emphasized that they are Catholic.

00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:18.670
Do you think this is very important, Catholic
or Christian, like their religion really helped

00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:21.910
them to make such a decision to really help
the people?

00:56:21.910 --> 00:56:22.910
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Ah.

00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:23.910
Good question.

00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:24.910
All right.

00:56:24.910 --> 00:56:28.220
It's one of those things I'd say, "Read more
about it and I'll let you draw your own conclusions."

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:30.020
I'll answer briefly.

00:56:30.020 --> 00:56:32.830
I'd say my answer is yes and no.

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:38.170
Their religion was important to them, and
it may have played a role in what they did,

00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:42.510
but in the reality of living their lives,
if they'd been following the religious leadership

00:56:42.510 --> 00:56:45.340
they had, they would not have been involved.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:50.000
The religious leadership, the clergy, weren't
always setting the examples.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.800
One could argue that's maybe still the case
today sometimes.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.950
It various, of course.

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:59.150
One of the biggest thorns for Frans in this
secret work that he's doing, trying to help

00:56:59.150 --> 00:57:03.700
save the lives of people, was his local parish
priest.

00:57:03.700 --> 00:57:05.140
It was different throughout the country.

00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.580
Some were helpful, some weren't.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:10.980
Some could care less, you don't bother, and
others would say, "I'll get involved."

00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:16.260
In the Netherlands, they'll lose over 90 Protestant
and Catholic clergy who will get executed

00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:18.720
or die in the concentration camps because
they do speak out.

00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:19.869
Many won't.

00:57:19.869 --> 00:57:21.830
He had the thorn in this case.

00:57:21.830 --> 00:57:23.900
So it's a mixed bag, who's going to help,
who's not.

00:57:23.900 --> 00:57:25.630
Is their religion driving them?

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.020
I think if you look more just as you draw
conclusions, there was a moral character.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:32.200
Whether it came from their Catholicism or
not, it was there.

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:36.470
If the Catholicism was not supporting it,
they would have the moral character to go,

00:57:36.470 --> 00:57:38.150
"We're going to still do the right thing."

00:57:38.150 --> 00:57:39.800
The ethics comes through.

00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.810
Great question.

00:57:41.810 --> 00:57:46.190
Let's make sure we get another question answered.

00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:49.320
Right, yeah, we always want to make sure of
this one here.

00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:51.150
Nadine, can you come on up here for a moment?

00:57:51.150 --> 00:57:55.540
We always want to make sure people get this
one.

00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:56.700
[pause]

00:57:56.700 --> 00:58:00.349
&gt;&gt;Nadine: [laughs] Whatever happened with
that baby?

00:58:00.349 --> 00:58:01.349
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Ah!

00:58:01.349 --> 00:58:03.110
Good question, good question.

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.550
Remember that challenge I mentioned, the baby?

00:58:05.550 --> 00:58:07.530
The woman is pregnant there?

00:58:07.530 --> 00:58:08.530
Uhuh.

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:09.831
Anyone want to answer that?

00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:10.831
What happens?

00:58:10.831 --> 00:58:11.831
[pause]

00:58:11.831 --> 00:58:12.831
&gt;&gt;Male #22: [inaudible]

00:58:12.831 --> 00:58:13.831
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Say that again.

00:58:13.831 --> 00:58:14.831
Say that again.

00:58:14.831 --> 00:58:15.831
&gt;&gt;Male #22: [inaudible]

00:58:15.831 --> 00:58:19.150
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: No, no, no, it was real.

00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:20.150
It was real.

00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:21.390
[laughs] She was about five months along.

00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:22.400
You can't hide that anymore.

00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.760
It wasn't just a pillow in there.

00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.100
I think you were starting to figure it out.

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.695
&gt;&gt;Male #22: Are we with the baby today?

00:58:29.695 --> 00:58:30.950
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: We are with the baby today.

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:31.950
[Leah Baars sings a note]

00:58:31.950 --> 00:58:33.099
&gt;&gt;Male #22: It looks just the same.

00:58:33.099 --> 00:58:34.099
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yes, yes.

00:58:34.099 --> 00:58:35.099
&gt;&gt;Baars: Oh, how do you know that?

00:58:35.099 --> 00:58:36.099
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Have you seen the pictures?

00:58:36.099 --> 00:58:37.099
You've seen the pictures.

00:58:37.099 --> 00:58:38.550
&gt;&gt;Baars: Oh, you've seen the pictures.

00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:39.550
&gt;&gt;Brounstein: Yeah, yes.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:42.070
I said I have a meaningful, personal connection
to the story.

00:58:42.070 --> 00:58:44.290
I brought her with me.

00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:46.060
[applause] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:47.830
Thank you, thank you.

00:58:47.830 --> 00:58:48.830
Your applause.

00:58:48.830 --> 00:58:52.810
[laughs] One of the things here, and I only
knew about this in terms of I knew her origins.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.400
I didn't know the specifics behind it.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:59.140
She's learned a lot in terms of all that went
going on there, not just for herself.

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:02.700
Well, Chapter 9 is the short answer to the
question.

00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:05.010
But this is one of their biggest dilemmas.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:07.619
Because if you think about it, how are you
going to have a baby under these circumstances?

00:59:07.619 --> 00:59:09.599
You can't go to the hospital.

00:59:09.599 --> 00:59:12.030
Good luck trying to find a doctor, because
most doctors are going to run from this.

00:59:12.030 --> 00:59:14.140
They don't want the authorities to know what
they're doing.

00:59:14.140 --> 00:59:16.940
It's too dangerous to touch a Jewish mother.

00:59:16.940 --> 00:59:19.240
So Frans and Mien have to deal with this.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:23.460
I'll just give you a little insight, because
they will decide that they will try to help.

00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:27.740
They have that-- Remember that first couple
they take into hiding, Lou and Angelien?

00:59:27.740 --> 00:59:29.400
Well, that's her parents.

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:33.580
They agree with them, this is the strategy:
however we get this pregnancy done, get the

00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:38.359
birth done, because we don't know how yet,
we're going to register her as our own child

00:59:38.359 --> 00:59:39.359
with the authorities.

00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:41.420
We can keep her with our children.

00:59:41.420 --> 00:59:45.140
In the event that danger comes, authorities
show up: "It's just one of our children.

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:47.020
We can keep her outside."

00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:49.420
That's pretty courageous.

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.920
They will perform a miracle.

00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:55.140
And I get to enjoy the miracle every day.

00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:58.750
I say, "Thank God for the courage and compassion
of Frans and Mien Wijnakker."

00:59:58.750 --> 00:59:59.750
Thank you all.

00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:00.750
Great audience.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.750
Thank you so much.

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:01.751
[applause]
