00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:18.610
The genesis of Sriracha hot 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:28.430
sauce (pronounced sir-ah-cha, contrary to
what many think) becoming the condiment staple

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.930
it is today can be traced back to 1975 and
an unassuming Vietnamese refuge called David

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.550
Tran- the founder and current CEO of Huy Fong
Foods.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.780
Following the Vietnam war, Tran, who was a
Major in the South Vietnamese army and otherwise

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.171
made his living making sauces, fled Vietnam
with his family in December of 1978, along

00:00:49.171 --> 00:00:56.310
with 3,317 other refugees, aboard a Taiwanese
freighter called the Huey Fong (meaning “Gathering

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:01.920
Prosperity”)- a name he’d later Anglicize
and use as the name of his massive, spicy

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
empire.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.630
Like many successful businessmen, Tran made
his fortune by noticing a consumer demand

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.200
that was going unfulfilled and filling it-
in this case, it all started with a demand

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.280
for hot sauce amongst the many Southeast Asian
immigrants in LA.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.450
More specifically, Tran got his start in the
U.S. by making a sauce he called Pepper Sa-te

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.800
(that he literally made in a bucket, bottled
in recycled baby food jars, and sold first

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.189
via bicycle and later out of a blue Chevy
van).

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.939
Tran noted, “I started the business with
my eyes closed.

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.319
There were no expectations at all…

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:37.869
My American dream was never to become a billionaire.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.319
We started this because we like fresh, spicy
chili sauce.”

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.659
Having a modicum of success in the industry,
he began experimenting with local ingredients,

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.819
eventually creating a slight variation of
a Thai recipe he liked that used, to quote,

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:55.000
“hybrid jalapeño peppers, vinegar, sugar,
salt, and garlic”.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.479
He named his version of this sauce “Sriracha”,
after the coastal town, Si Racha, in Thailand

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.799
where the base recipe he tweaked originated.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.039
Recipe perfected, he began selling his Sriracha
sauce alongside his Pepper Sa-te.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.650
To quite literally put his stamp on his sauces,
like he had previously done in Vietnam, Tran

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.129
attached a label with a rooster on every bottle
of sauce he sold.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.620
According to the man himself, he chose a rooster
as the symbol for his company because the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.560
year he was born, 1945, was the year of the
rooster according to the Vietnamese zodiac.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.909
As for who designed the now famous logo, not
even Tran knows and he credits the original

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:33.480
drawing, which he has long since lost, to
an unnamed Vietnamese street artist he met

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.650
in the 1970s.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.120
As Tran quipped, “I never thought that I’d
be successful so I didn’t keep any of my

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.120
souvenirs…”

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.519
Speaking of branding and failing to plan for
success, while the exact rooster logo cannot

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.659
be copied by other companies legally (though
many-a-company makes exceptionally similar

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:53.580
bottles and logos for their Sriracha to trick
people into thinking it’s Huy Fong brand),

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.400
Tran didn’t bother trademarking the name
Sriracha, so any company can call their product

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.140
that without fear of being sued.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.160
Given how popular the sauce has become, such
copying is now common practice.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.180
For instance, even the likes of Taco Bell
has jumped on the Sriracha knock-off train.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.689
The noted fast food chain chose to come up
with their own version of the sauce, rather

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.780
than just use the original Sriracha, despite
in some of their ads showing the Huy Fong

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.829
Sriracha bottle design and referring to their
Sriracha as the “Rooster sauce”…

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:25.140
In their case, their decision not to use Tran’s
sauce is somewhat inexplicable as Huy Fong

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.420
hasn’t increased the wholesale price of
Sriracha since Tran originally made it in

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.230
the 1970s, meaning it’s relatively cheap,
and Tran states he doesn’t charge royalties

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.090
to use his sauce in this way.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.000
Because of this, many restaurant chains just
go with the original, rather than the many

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.349
knock-offs or making their own.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.580
Of the Taco Bell situation, Tran laments,
“For us, it’s a disappointment if people

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.190
think it’s our product.”

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.120
Nevertheless, he states he doesn’t regret
not trademarking the name, noting that it’s

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.060
basically free advertising when major companies
like Taco Bell do this.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.999
Tran states, “We have lawyers come and say
‘I can represent you and sue’ and I say

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:00.999
‘No.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:01.999
Let them do it.'”

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:06.030
He also believes his company still makes the
best Sriracha (for reasons we’ll get into

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.269
shortly), so customers will eventually buy
his product anyway in his opinion.

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:14.019
Back to the hot sauce- during the early 1980s,
Tran was still selling his sauce from the

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.430
back of the aforementioned van that he had
personally hand-painted a large version of

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:24.670
his rooster logo; but in 1980, his budding
sauce empire had grown to require a 5000 sq

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.362
foot (about 460 square meter) warehouse which
he rented in LA’s Chinatown.

00:04:28.362 --> 00:04:34.520
At this point, he was making not just Pepper
Sa-te and Sriracha, but also Chili Garlic,

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.200
Sambal Badjak, and Sambal Oelek.

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.910
In the few decades since, the company has
expanded to a sprawling facility in Irwindale,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.010
comprising of a massive 650,000 square feet
(about 60,000 square meters) building.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.530
The location of this facility is critical
as, unlike pretty much every other major hot

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.070
sauce maker on the planet, Tran has always
insisted that his hot sauce be made using

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.040
fresh, rather than dried, chillies.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.760
To this end, all chillies used to create Huy
Fong Sriracha hot sauce are processed within

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.410
a day of being picked.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.070
Because of this, they only make new vats of
the sauce at a certain time of year and Tran

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.720
must source his chillies from a local farm,
in this case located just an hour away from

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.820
his factory in Irwindale.

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.920
Tran reports his choice of using local product
(including buying the other ingredients like

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.410
salt, sugar, and vinegar from U.S. companies)
is not just because of the freshness, but

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.570
is also to pay back the United States for
being the only country that would grant him

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.920
asylum when he was fleeing Vietnam.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.850
As you might expect, being restricted to just
one local supplier is a major problem for

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:40.760
Huy Fong as they quite literally cannot keep
up with the demand for their Sriracha, despite

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.310
never having spent a single cent on advertising,
nor, according to Tran, do they even have

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.360
a sales department, having used the same 10
distributors for decades.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.550
As Tran himself so eloquently puts it “I
don’t advertise, because I can’t advertise”.

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.330
That’s not to say they only produce Sriracha
in small quantities.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:01.460
With an initial contract of using 50 acres
of the Underwood family farms to grow chili

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.700
peppers, today that number has swelled to
a whopping 1,700 acres (about 2.7 square miles

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:13.570
or 7 square kilometers), resulting in well
over 100 million pounds (about 45 million

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:19.100
kg) of chillies harvested over a 10 week period
in which they make their entire year’s supply

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.100
of Sriracha.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:25.590
The result of all this is an estimated $100
million per year in revenue for Huy Fong-

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.680
a number that, according to Tran, has been
growing by approximately 20% per year for

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.740
many years now as they manage to slowly increase
production to attempt to meet demand of their

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:35.820
sauces- king among them being Sriracha.

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.680
Beyond not trademarking the name of his flagship
product, never advertising nor employing a

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.600
sales department, and never once raising the
wholesale price of Sriracha (a claim we have

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.600
to take his word on because he’s never publicly
revealed what exactly he charges his distributors),

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:48.230
Tran also bucks the normal trend in business
when demand outstrips supply, as it has pretty

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.400
much since the beginning for Sriracha.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:55.690
Instead of raising prices, he insists his
distributors never charge more than $7.99

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.910
for a bottle of his sauce, even in the largest
sizes.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.130
This is to keep in line with Huy Fong Foods’
motto of “a rich man’s sauce at a poor

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.130
man’s price”.

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:08.950
On top of this, Tran is famous for turning
down very lucrative business deals in connection

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.840
with his sauces, as well as several attempts
by major food manufacturers to outright buy

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.840
Huy Fong Foods, for no doubt obscene amounts
of money.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.810
When once asked why he was seemingly so against
maximizing profits on his product, a frustrated

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.540
Tran reiterated that his only goal is to sell
hot sauce to those who want it, and that businesses

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.440
that approach him “are never interested
in the product, only in the profits…”

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.930
Thus, given they don’t really care about
the product itself in his estimation, he has

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.150
no interest in making business deals with
them, regardless of how much money it might

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.150
make him.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.720
Again, as he so poignantly noted, his simple
dream “was never to become a billionaire.”

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.480
But rather, “to make enough fresh chili
sauce so that everyone who wants Huy Fong

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.480
can have it.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:10:37.089
Nothing more.”
