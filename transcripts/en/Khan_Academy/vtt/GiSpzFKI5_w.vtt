00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.750
We're asked to simplify 8 plus
5 times 4 minus, and then in

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.010
parentheses, 6 plus 10
divided by 2 plus 44.

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.120
Whenever you see some type of
crazy expression like this

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.360
where you have parentheses and
addition and subtraction and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.760
division, you always want
to keep the order of

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.000
operations in mind.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.970
Let me write them
down over here.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.420
So when you're doing order of
operations, or really when

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:24.820
you're evaluating any
expression, you should have

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.520
this in the front of your brain
that the top priority

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.770
goes to parentheses.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.060
And those are these little
brackets over here, or however

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.670
you want to call them.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.320
Those are the parentheses
right there.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.030
That gets top priority.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.120
Then after that, you want to
worry about exponents.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.240
There are no exponents in this
expression, but I'll just

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.150
write it down just for future
reference: exponents.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.000
One way I like to think about it
is parentheses always takes

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.730
top priority, but then after
that, we go in descending

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.610
order, or I guess we should
say in-- well, yeah, in

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.400
descending order of how fast
that computation is.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.520
When I say fast, how
fast it grows.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.800
When I take something to an
exponent, when I'm taking

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.270
something to a power, it grows
really fast. Then it grows a

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.730
little bit slower or shrinks
a little bit slower if I

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.760
multiply or divide,
so that comes

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.800
next: multiply or divide.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.910
Multiplication and division
comes next, and then last of

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:27.550
all comes addition
and subtraction.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.950
So these are kind of the
slowest operations.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.450
This is a little bit faster.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.610
This is the fastest operation.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.290
And then the parentheses,
just no matter

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.980
what, always take priority.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.180
So let's apply it over here.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.290
Let me rewrite this
whole expression.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.960
So it's 8 plus 5 times 4 minus,
in parentheses, 6 plus

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.150
10 divided by 2 plus 44.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.730
So we're going to want to do the
parentheses first. We have

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.050
parentheses there and there.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.170
Now this parentheses is pretty
straightforward.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.120
Well, inside the parentheses
is already evaluated, so we

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.009
could really just view
this as 5 times 4.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.000
So let's just evaluate that
right from the get go.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.935
So this is going to result in
8 plus-- and really, when

00:02:14.935 --> 00:02:16.650
you're evaluating the
parentheses, if your evaluate

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.980
this parentheses, you literally
just get 5, and you

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.070
evaluate that parentheses, you
literally just get 4, and then

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.930
they're next to each other,
so you multiply them.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.170
So 5 times 4 is 20 minus--
let me stay

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.960
consistent with the colors.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.290
Now let me write the next
parenthesis right there, and

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.050
then inside of it, we'd evaluate
this first. Let me

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.080
close the parenthesis
right there.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.280
And then we have plus 44.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.250
So what is this thing right here
evaluate to, this thing

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.800
inside the parentheses?

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.170
Well, you might be tempted
to say, well, let me

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.160
just go left to right.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.770
6 plus 10 is 16 and then
divide by 2 and

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.780
you would get 8.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080
But remember: order
of operations.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.760
Division takes priority over
addition, so you actually want

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.850
to do the division first, and
we could actually write it

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:05.790
here like this.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.960
You could imagine putting
some more parentheses.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.790
Let me do it in that
same purple.

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.200
You could imagine putting some
more parentheses right here to

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.110
really emphasize the fact that
you're going to do the

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.760
division first.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.740
So 10 divided by 2 is 5, so this
will result in 6, plus 10

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.560
divided by 2, is 5.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.730
6 plus 5.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.230
Well, we still have to evaluate
this parentheses, so

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.600
this results-- what's
6 plus 5?

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.050
Well, that's 11.

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.630
So we're left with
the 20-- let me

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.630
write it all down again.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.050
We're left with 8 plus
20 minus 6 plus 5,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.000
which is 11, plus 44.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.820
And now that we have everything
at this level of

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.580
operations, we can just
go left to right.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.770
So 8 plus 20 is 28, so you
can view this as 28

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.890
minus 11 plus 44.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.030
28 minus 11-- 28 minus 10
would be 18, so this

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.386
is going to be 17.

00:04:07.386 --> 00:04:10.630
It's going to be 17 plus 44.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.209
And then 17 plus 44-- I'll
scroll down a little bit.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.160
7 plus 44 would be 51, so
this is going to be 61.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.940
So this is going to
be equal to 61.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:26.460
And we're done!
