00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
We also learned about planning--in particular, breadth-first planning,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
A-star planning, and dynamic programming planning

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that all address slightly different use cases.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Those are being used to plan the trajectory of the Google Street-View car

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and the Darpa Grand Challenge cars.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In fact, you implemented a good number of those, which is quite amazing.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here is my quiz for planning.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
You learned about breadth first, A-star, dynamic programming,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and for the sake of this comparison I will also include the smoother,

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which is more like plan refinement.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Check any or all of those boxes if the corresponding planner

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
acts in a continuous space, if it finds an optimal solution,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
if it's a universal plan--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
that means the solution, once found, can be applied to arbitrary states--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
or if the solution is local, which means given an approximate initial solution,

00:00:56.000 --> 09:59:59.000
it cannot really do anything more than just locally refine the solution.
