well I have a science background I

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699
well I have a science background I
 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.460
well I have a science background I
studied biology well I had a different

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470
studied biology well I had a different
 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.500
studied biology well I had a different
imagination how biologists would work I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510
imagination how biologists would work I
 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.470
imagination how biologists would work I
thought they are much more dedicated to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
thought they are much more dedicated to
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.840
thought they are much more dedicated to
fieldwork and a lot of their work takes

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
fieldwork and a lot of their work takes
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.880
fieldwork and a lot of their work takes
place in labs and whatever so so I

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890
place in labs and whatever so so I
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.310
place in labs and whatever so so I
realized well I want to be out in the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
realized well I want to be out in the
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.799
realized well I want to be out in the
field and and I did already during my

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809
field and and I did already during my
 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.799
field and and I did already during my
study I financed my study partly with

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809
study I financed my study partly with
 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.780
study I financed my study partly with
photography and was traveling a lot and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
photography and was traveling a lot and
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.570
photography and was traveling a lot and
was out there a lot and and I was

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580
was out there a lot and and I was
 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.090
was out there a lot and and I was
important to me so it just became the

I love to explore new ranges in in the
 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.500
I love to explore new ranges in in the
environment and and and this are these

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510

acidic fluids or gases is it it's always

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710
acidic fluids or gases is it it's always
 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.760
acidic fluids or gases is it it's always
kind of difficult and I mean you try to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770
kind of difficult and I mean you try to
 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.830
kind of difficult and I mean you try to
find a way around and even if the

some way lighting is always a challenge
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.640
some way lighting is always a challenge
especially in these caves and ice I work

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650
especially in these caves and ice I work
 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.880
especially in these caves and ice I work
with all sorts of lighting technologies

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890
with all sorts of lighting technologies
 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.430
with all sorts of lighting technologies
yeah and combined and and you you can't

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440
yeah and combined and and you you can't
 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.030
yeah and combined and and you you can't
say a distinct way how I do it I make it

always dependent on the environment and
and how I could best light it and I

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700
and how I could best light it and I
 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.050
and how I could best light it and I
constructed my my personal trigger

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060
constructed my my personal trigger
 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.930
constructed my my personal trigger
devices which are capable to ignite even

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940
devices which are capable to ignite even
 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.120
devices which are capable to ignite even
flash bulbs things like that that they

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130
flash bulbs things like that that they
 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.200
flash bulbs things like that that they
are triggered according to the camera

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210
are triggered according to the camera
 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.190
are triggered according to the camera
and yeah well there a lot of things to

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200
and yeah well there a lot of things to
 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.600
and yeah well there a lot of things to
it and I always experiment and try to

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610
it and I always experiment and try to
 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.860
it and I always experiment and try to
discover some new ways that's

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870
discover some new ways that's
 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.180
discover some new ways that's
interesting to me to come up with

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190
interesting to me to come up with
 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:31.230
interesting to me to come up with
something new

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240
 
 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.770
 
yeah I'm not sure if I need my

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780
yeah I'm not sure if I need my
 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.750

flexible and surprised always from a
different angle and that's I I play a

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780
different angle and that's I I play a
 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.430
different angle and that's I I play a
lot with my motives and I might come in

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440
lot with my motives and I might come in
 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.410
lot with my motives and I might come in
future from a completely different angle

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420
future from a completely different angle
 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.860
future from a completely different angle
and maybe is a complete different way of

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870
and maybe is a complete different way of
 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.210
and maybe is a complete different way of
work but I always like to surprise so
