00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.070
We can just filter the image, right?

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.797
So we filter the image, tada.

00:00:03.797 --> 00:00:04.372
Yuck.

00:00:04.372 --> 00:00:05.527
All right.

00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:08.760
You know, the first thing
that happens is you realize

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.550
you've got all of these white pixels.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.270
Why is that?

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.171
Well, because they didn't have
a huge amount of V but they,

00:00:16.171 --> 00:00:20.685
they still had, a reasonable
amount of that Y, all right?

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:22.545
So how would filter out
these bright pixels?

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.745
Well duh, you would just reduce
the requirement on the luminance,

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:29.865
we're not going to allow all
of the Y pixels anymore.

00:00:29.865 --> 00:00:32.034
Instead, we'll filter,
we might say, well,

00:00:32.034 --> 00:00:36.960
we're going to allow the luminance of
just, I don't know, 0 to 150, let's say.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.660
And so that would eliminate, so
here we are in the same, right?

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.860
That, so
that would capture all of these pixels.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.550
All right?

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.920
So now if we use that, right?

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.880
We in,
we include the Y value of 0 to 150,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.520
we get a much better
selection of the red pixels.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.550
And this is just to show you comparison
that it's just easier to do this on the,

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.462
in the YUV space than the RGB space.

00:01:02.462 --> 00:01:05.450
The only reason this is easier
is because we're using boxes.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.110
Right.
Because there's a linear combination of

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.220
RGB that will give you almost prelim,
it'll give you YUV.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.260
If you could orient your boxes they
would end being the same filter, but

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.835
if your trying to limit the boxes
they would be straightforward.
