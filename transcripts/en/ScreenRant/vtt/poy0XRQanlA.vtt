00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.550
Not every movie needs a twist ending to drive
its point home, or even tries to stun audiences

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.990
before they leave the theatre.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.570
But just because a movie lacks a jaw-dropping
twist, it doesn't mean that was never the

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.570
plan.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.210
You'd be surprised to learn just how many
movies could have turned out completely different

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.160
if their original twists made it to the finished
film.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.210
Here are Screenrant's 10 Amazing Movie Twists
You've Never Seen.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.480
Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (New
Line Cinema)&nbsp;

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.301
The hours of extra footage released in the
Lord of the Rings Extended Editions show that

00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:40.460
plenty of key scenes had to be cut before
release, but one scene in the final movie

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.760
seems too incredible to have left out.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.330
When Aragorn and his assemble outside the
Black Gate for one last battle, the original

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.710
version of the scene saw Sauron himself take
a physical form, and fight the new king.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.220
It was an amazing twist, and in the end, too
amazing, since it made Frodo and Sam's ring

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.030
drama seem less important.

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.930
Sauron was replaced by a massive troll instead.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.850
The Avengers: Age of Ultron (Marvel/Disney)&nbsp;

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.899
The second team up of Marvel's biggest stars
ended on a bittersweet note, with speedster

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.979
Quicksilver dead, and a batch of new heroes
set to become the *New* Avengers.

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.720
But the hero's death wasn't always a sure
thing: director Joss Whedon admitted that

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.590
the final scene was filmed with Quicksilver
included, in a new costume to boot.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.400
To add insult to injury, Marvel taking longer
than expected to get a new Spider-Man and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.430
Captain Marvel off the ground meant Whedon
couldn't include them in the closing scene,

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.430
as he'd planned.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.320
Spider-Man would have had fans cheering, but
Whedon thought it would just be funny to include

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.010
Captain Marvel without any explanation.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.190
In the end, the bombshell, and the joke, were
nowhere to be found.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.000
World War Z (Paramount)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.220
Seeing Brad Pitt battle zombies in a blockbuster
movie seemed like a dream come true, but his

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.610
character Gerry's story didn't always end
so happily.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.350
Instead of a third act that saw Gerry discover
how to solve the zombie crisis, and return

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.740
back safely to his family, the original ending
told a completely different story.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.170
Gerry's plane would have landed in Moscow,
where he was forced to join a zombie death

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.830
squad for months, eventually taking part in
a massive battle in Red Square.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.260
And why did Lost Star Matthew Fox play such
a tiny role?

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.090
He had claimed Gerry's family as his own,
driving the lost father and husband to cross

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.250
an ocean back to America, storming the beach
in a storm of zombie carnage.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.260
Then the credits rolled, setting up an even
more intense sequel.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.260
Oh well.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.840
Happy endings are fun too.

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.600
Alien (20th Century Fox)&nbsp;

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.570
With Ridley Scott's alien horror, Hollywood
didn't just get one its most successful movie

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.230
monsters, but one of its greatest sci-fi icons,
and a badass woman for the ages.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.790
But it wasn't always going to play out that
way.

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.670
The original script ended with more horror
than victory, with Ripley being ambushed by

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.780
the Xenomorph, biting her head clean off before
sending a message to Earth using her own voice.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.720
It's definitely a creepy ending and a shocking
twist, but considering the franchise that

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.430
developed around Ripley, it was probably the
way to go.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.040
Rocky Balboa (MGM/Columbia)&nbsp;

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.450
Sylvester Stallone blurred the line between
fiction and reality with the 2006 return to

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.420
the role of Rocky, playing an old champion
whose best days are behind him, but refuses

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.420
to be forgotten.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.700
The movie sent a good message though, since
Rocky proved that youth isn't everything,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.670
losing to a younger, faster boxer, but not
really caring since he put up a good fight.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.540
If that sounds cheesy to you, the original
ending actually had Rocky win the fight, and

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.410
remaining as potent a fighter at an old age
as he was in his prime.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.260
In the end, they decided to keep it at least
somewhat believable.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.580
Se7en (New Line Cinema)&nbsp;

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.310
Sometimes, it's the idea of a studio NOT going
with a twist ending that seems insane in hindsight.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.260
In the case of the dark serial killer thriller
Seven, director David Fincher and star Brad

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.170
Pitt were set on keeping the movie's "what's
in the box" ending, no matter how hard the

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.290
studio pushed.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.760
The serial killer John Doe pushing Pittâ€™s
character to kill him meant the villain won,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.060
with an innocent woman killed in the process.

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.800
The studio tried to come up with a different
ending, from having the plan foiled to it

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.780
only be a dog's head in the box.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.360
But the strangest idea was to have Morgan
Freeman's soon-to-be-retiring cop gun down

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.660
the killer instead, sacrificing his own freedom
just to keep evil from winning the day.

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.380
Fincher stuck to his guns, and the darkest,
and most disturbing ending possible guaranteed

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.440
the movie's place in Noir history.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.539
Terminator Salvation (Warner Bros.)&nbsp;

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:25.100
It's no secret that more Terminator sequels
have been disappointing than cult classics,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.770
but the original version of Terminator Salvation
at least wanted to try something interesting.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.210
In the finished movie, John Connor's heart
was injured in a battle with a T-800, so a

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.180
Terminator/Human hybrid named Marcus sacrificed
his own to keep the resistance leader alive.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.430
But the original ending had Connor die, and
his inner circle decide to attach his face

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.710
to Marcus, letting the Terminator lead humanity
to victory in disguise.

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.930
If that wasn't dark enough, the director claimed
that HIS ending would have seen the operation

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.030
succeed.... before Marcus murdered everybody.

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.130
So Salvation could've been a lot worse.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.910
Superman II (Warner Bros.)

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.960
When Man of Steel ended with the controversial
death of General Zod, and some fans claimed

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.070
that showing Superman commit murder was heresy,
their opponents pointed to Superman 2.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.020
The movie where Superman stripped Zod and
his partners of their powers, then beat them

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:20.180
to a pulp and watched them fall to their deaths.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.800
It's a fair defence of Zack Snyder's reboot,
but the original cut of the movie showed the

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.300
Kryptonians didn't die after all.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.410
Instead they were arrested by - we're not
joking - Arctic police.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.120
The trip wound up serving hard time for their
crimes, which means the Man of Steel debate

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.860
will probably never end.

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.990
Dawn of the Planet of The Apes (20th Century
Fox)

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.330
The second film in the rebooted Planet of
the Apes series took audiences by storm, with

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.130
most of the credit given to the cast underneath
the cg makeup of the Apes.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.390
But the original ending of the movie set the
stage for an even bigger thriller.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.750
When the human forces are dealt with, the
apes' leader Caesar learns that reinforcements

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.120
are already in the way.

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.310
The final shot shows Caesar's eyes preparing
for the war ahead, but the movie was originally

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.090
planned to show the Navy arriving, and the
Apes squaring off on the Golden Gate bridge.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.400
It achieved the same goal, but the director
thought it only tied his hands for any sequel.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.680
Hancock (Columbia Pictures)&nbsp;

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.710
Will Smith's turn as a super powered super
slacker was a strange mix of action, comedy,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.639
superhero origin and mythical love story - but
while the original script and the finished

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.639
movie were pretty weird, it almost went to
a very, very dark place.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.479
Instead of learning that his friend's wife
was his super powered soul mate (Charlize

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.010
Theron clips from movie's second half), the
original script had Hancock kidnap and try

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.930
to force himself on her before slaughtering
the horde of police officers who arrive to

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:40.270
rescue her.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.740
Just to guarantee audiences left the theatre
with their jaws dropped, he would then try

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.490
to kill himself with one of the cop's guns.

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.949
The bullet didn't leave a mark, but it shocked
the studio into changing the film's direction

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:52.280
completely.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.580
