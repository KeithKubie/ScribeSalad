Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:05          let's shift, let's talk about the scary you right. Are you ready? I tried to do this. We did the happy stuff. Now we're going to plunge with, look, you know, Dave, when I began to research this thing, I probably ended up reading about 200 books on this topic when the end and, and I'm a happy guy. I like happy things. I like technology. I'm an optimistic guy, but this really put me in a dark place. Uh, digging through this history, uh, from, from Hagle essentially up to Julius Caesar Eveleigh and the, and the post were Nazi movement and realizing that there was an intellectual stream that stretched over all of these years. Let's go back 200 years. Yeah. So let's go back 200 years when you talk about right wing collectivism. Yeah. Because I think most of my audience now understands what left wing collectivism is cause that's what we've got right now.

Speaker 2:          00:54          Very in a very strong way. Talk to me about right wing collectivism. Okay, Dave, I'm going to tell you a story. Um, I, I love Ludi muses. I think he was a genius, right? And I thought I'd read all of his works, but in there is a transcript of a lecture he gave in 1956 at the San Francisco Public Library. And he had about three sentences in there that just knocked me over and I couldn't believe it. It cause it explains so much. He says something like this and he's speaking casually, right? He says, Hagle ruined German philosophy for a century. Uh, his original followers became, uh, believed that all of history would end in the Prussian state, in the Prussian church, having all power in the individuality, individualism, they became the right Hegelians. Galleons that became the Nazis is the dissonance of this, uh, of the writer. Gillian's became the lefty.

Speaker 2:          01:53          Gillian's they wanted a universal transformation of humanity and a, and a historical drive to, to something other than the commercial society. They became the Marxists and, uh, and the communists. And he said that that's, it's left, right yelling aneurysm. And that explains pretty much all political history. And I closed that. I thought, hmm, that explains more than practically any other book I've ever read. And so I began to, began to explore this. I understood the left to Galleon as I understood Marxism. I mean, those were, those were our professors, right? Um, and there are annoying. Um, but what I did not understand what the writer Gillion of them and what that, what that tradition looks like. It's the throne and alter, uh, this, this historic says to view that the nation should constitute its own unit of profound integrity, uh, that, that that is more important than the, than the individual.

Speaker 2:          02:53          And that commercial society was too chaotic. That it, that that was leading us, giving us wrong kind of progress. That it was flattening out the hierarchies that we need to have an orderly life. Right? This is, this is the writer Gelien pitch that ultimately by mid 20th century becomes this very dangerous, dangerous movement in Europe. You know, um, that became catastrophic. Uh, but it gradually emerged from all the way from, from Hagle because, uh, this is at the end of the endless, seemingly in those Franco Prussian wars. There's this battle at the battle of Jenna that, that Germany lost. And the explanation for that was that it was a temporary setback. That history was going to determine that Germany would rise despite, despite the choices of individuals. History has got its wind. It's like a Meta narrative that, that, that was going to override everything. Hegel himself was a theologian by the way.

Speaker 2:          03:54          Um, and, and so this, this view began to kind of spread throughout German academia. And it was, it ended up being imported to the United States through, through circuitous means, but what, but one of the great theorists of the, of the 1840 [inaudible] who, and 1850s who brought the suit to the United States, there's physical list, who was one of the first economist to repudiate the free trade tradition of, of, of the Smithian Manchester Rides. And that was celebrating the nation as a, as a unit, as a productive power, uh, and, and believed in tariff walls, uh, which was strange. And I've read his book, uh, but, and that had a huge influence of American trade policy is actually the late 19th century. And, um, and it began to flow out from there. So Thomas Carlyle and, and Britain now, uh, began to celebrate the great man theory of history.

Speaker 2:          04:52          And really we're nothing without Napoleon, without, without gigantic of figures that we can worship, admire, and s and our individuality should be subsumed within them. They act for us. They're God, like, you know, and, and, and it was Thomas Carlyle who first coined the phrase, um, uh, quite coin, the phrase to describe economics as being the dismal science. And the reason he said that is that every condoms team new imagined a world without slavery. And he said, kind of have a website slavery. That's a tread for world without slaves. You don't have masters, right? And we need a world with masters and slaves, so we can, we can have a vision of hierarchy and greatness without that, we don't have greatness. So he began to see this building of this intellectual apparatus that was not left together. And there wasn't Marxist who was actually anti Marxist in a strange way, but as an alternative form of collectivism, uh, it began with a kind of historicism and a celebration on nationalism of the German state.

Speaker 2:          05:55          It began to grow with this, this alternative theory of trade that we should, we should build up tariff walls and Carlisle with his, with his great man theory of history and then, and then, uh, Rueskin and Britain with his haste hatred of Commercial Society because they believed that somehow, uh, commerce was ruining quality and culture and was giving us mass production. But we all need to be really doing is, is, is, uh, uh, living in guilds and, and making our own stuff, you know, because we're going to destroy English life and English country life. And so, so, uh, a full scale reactionary trend on the right began to develop. And were you always a racial element to know? So that's what's interesting. I'm so glad you asked that because it comes about first of all, through, through nationalism now and the, and the early 1820s and 1830s, this celebration of nationalism.

Speaker 2:          06:46          Now you have to ask yourself, what is a nation, Bret, what do we mean when we say nation? And, and I'm taking this a lot of this from, um, uh, from, uh, uh, an essay gave it, given the 1882 by Erin ran in a great French historian. Uh, looking back at the rise of nationalism said, there's only five ways you can consider nationalism. Uh, you consider, uh, the geographic definition. So we're just live in this space. There's a dynastic element. We can all trace our lineage back to the great founders of our nation. There's a language theory of nationals and we all speak the same language. There's a religious theory of nationalism. We all worship God and it precisely the same way I believe in transubstantiation. You believe in consubstantiation, we can't be part of the same nation and that case, right? And then finally, and probably most insidiously, there was the ratio, the ratio of view.

Speaker 2:          07:39          And that came along and essentially the 1860s and 1870s, with a misapplication of Darwinian theory and scientific racism came along. And that's wept through academia, particularly in the United States. Like nothing you've ever seen. It's absolutely astonishing how much racism with Orthodoxy and American academia in the 1890 [inaudible], the very first monograph published by the American economy, Economic Association by gay men, I think his name is Andre Hoffman. It was called race traits of the American Negro. And the first chapter dress goes all in. You know, it's, it's, it's the, the horror of the black people that don't have the right values. They can't, can't save money. They're just terrible. A shiftless and lazy and ghastly and uncivilized double. And now chapter two, the Jews, you know, these people, I don't know what, they've got this crazy out of control commercial ethic. They can't stop hoarding money.

Speaker 2:          08:39          They really went for it. Yeah. And then the third chapter three is the slops and, and so on. And so the American Economic Association, you know, and then, uh, and there was essentially, no, what do you think was happening in the world there? That it was taking a time, what was happening? Dave? Laissez faire had transformed societies so dramatically that there the intellectuals felt that they had lost control. And that you might think that when the world becomes massively prosperous and we suddenly have cities rising up and we've got steel that is transverse in large bodies of water and we're developing the telephone and indoor electricity and, and people are living longer lives and, and so much wealth was being created that everybody was data per say. Hooray. We found the answers. But the gatekeepers who had controlled everything for so long. So that's so interesting because of revolt.

Speaker 2:          09:28          This is sort of what it feels like now to me, the gatekeepers, we've had so much success. There's so, there's so many reasons right now to understand how great everything is. That book right there by Steven Pinker enlightenment is, is all about how great things are. And a gratefully we are, there is less violence now and all sorts of the revolt you always have to be on the gatekeepers are having, are not in the narrative to intellectuals are what digital closet calls the clerisy. Right? So it's, it's the high end intellectuals, it's the power elite bureaucrats in the, in the public, the permanent peace keepers of our civic culture. You know, it's, it's the political class. And, uh, so this is sort of what for my audience that maybe not follow this, this is sort of what the New York Times is sort of, right. But like, yeah, maybe I shouldn't have said it so obviously, but like that's kind of what it is.

Speaker 2:          10:21          Like that class, the ruling class. Yeah. The ruling class. And they were in full scale revolted. They did not like what was happening to the world and the 18, 80s and 90s, because of the loss of control. And so the, the scientific racism came along to add to the celebration of dictatorship and the, and the, and protectionism and the new nationalism to add a very insidious element, which culminated in Eugenics ideology. And that's when it gets very strange. And this is where, this is where the reading gets very difficult because now you're reading all the way into, uh, you know, the, the, the 1910s with the works of Oswald Spangler, you know, the right, who galleon German theorist that enraptured every American, you know, they're all reading his book. Oh my God. The decline of the West. We better reconstitute ourselves as the tribe, or we're going to be eaten alive by flood out the other foreigners and then, but there's a strain of that that's still going on right now.

Speaker 2:          11:16          You know, there's nothing new, you know, like, um, and you know, this, this very funny book called the passing of the great race by Madison Grant, uh, that was on every coffee table in the late 19 teens and early 19th, 20th, you know, with this forecasting doom for the white race. You know, and he was, he was a fascinating figure because, um, you know, of course I've read his book as, as it everybody did. Everybody the great Gatsby makes a pass in reference to it. It was that popular. It was that popular. And I tell you, there's not a single outright racist alive today who hasn't, is not repeating those cliches that were written by Madison Grant has all pseudoscience is all just nonsense. And it's just ridiculous. Embarrassing. But, but it keeps being resurrected. But here's what's interesting. He was a thoroughgoing a Darwinian, because you recall that Darwin, Darwin had two great books, origin these pieces.

Speaker 2:          12:10          The other was called the descent of man. And the descent of man had the very unfortunate paragraph in there where he regret regrets. Um, the invention of mass, uh, disease killing, uh, uh, uh, cures essentially. It's like if we keep curing people and we keep feeding a inferior people and, and curing disease, then then our genetic stock students kind of go down and down, you know, so, so they were all kind of playing off this little, the passage. But Madison Grant was, was not an unusual by American x to academic standards at all. They, they, this was orthodox in the 18, Tencent 1820s. What made Madison Grant Interesting? You can look up his Wikipedia entry right now. Uh, if you look it up, it'll, it'll celebrate him as the, as the father of the National Park Service.

Speaker 2:          13:00          Well, in the course of my research, I'm wondering to know what is the connection between Madison's grants hardcore eugenics based racism and as environmentalist them? Hmm. What is the relationship there? And it's not just two people usually people have, have it figured out in their own heads. I went through and read some of his works on, on the environment. It turns out that he had a master race theory of nature, and he went to the California redwoods and he looked at these glorious mighty trees and he was horrified to see they're being cut down for, for, for, for making coffee tables and boats and things like that. And he thought it was dis genic to nature. So he wanted the master race, uh, the California redwoods to be protected. And that's that. So that's why he started the national park service. And now the left Harold's them as, as, as great as a great visionary, environmentalist. But actually he was like a tree Nazi. I don't know how else you want to call.

Speaker 2:          13:56          It's very creepy stuff. We don't have enough Nazi labels being thrown around now. We're going to have tree nuts even. Sure. That already was nuts. Um, but you know, you can just march through the history and it gets worse and worse. And then to me, Dave, it'll, it all culminates in the works of Karl Schmidt, uh, from the, from the late 1930s and his, and his amazing book called the concept of the political. And if you'll give me just one quick second to explain this, because, because you as a liberal, uh, need to read this book because it's the most passionate, I would say, and even competent attack on liberalism Britain in the 20th century. Now, Carl Schmidt, that's a jurist of brilliant man and a philosopher and a hardcore Nazi. Okay. He wasn't tried at Nuremberg. He escape. I'm merely an intellectual. Okay, sure. His book concepts with the political says, what's wrong with liberalism?

Speaker 2:          14:47          I tell you, it's still nothing happens, nothing dramatic. There's nothing requires no courage whatsoever. Liberalism is a life in which we all benefit from each other's presence. We all just trade with each other. What kind of life is that where we all just are kind of the same and like each other and hold backyard barbecues and go baseball games and, and just get richer and live longer lives and send our kid to college. This is terrible. We need to live big, dramatic, mighty, bold, courageous, transformative lives and live in times that, that, that, that, that, that are shocking, that are amazing, that make our lives worth living, that requires above all else politics. Liberalism imagines a world without politics. That's a terrifying world. What we need is a world of politics and, and he continues to lay it out chapter by chapter. Why we have to destroy the liberalism and celebrate the concept of the political and for him that means having friends and having enemies defeating your enemies and rallying around your friends.

Speaker 2:          15:52          Now who are your friends and who your enemies and Carl Schmidt says, at some level, it doesn't matter. What matters is that they exist and the state, the powerful men will choose them for us. They will decide who our friends and our enemies are. Now let's be clear what we mean by enemy. I don't don't mean somebody you don't like. I mean the willingness to kill there has to be the presence of real bloodshed in your time. For you to have a sufficiently prescient sense of enemies, this so that you'll feel the intense desire to rally around your fence for your friends and experience that, that, that the, the awesomeness that only comes with belonging to a group. So, so he says, so he, at the end feeling there is that you can't achieve what, what the real purpose of a human is that you can experience whatever the highs of belongingness essentially, and the life of drama that a big important life without being part of a kind of a, uh, a group on the move, the slaughtering and its enemies.

Speaker 2:          16:57          And so we have to have the presence of, of bloodshed. So it really is the opposite of live and let live. It is. It's so through, through, through bloodshed comes life and without, without bloodshed and death and violence in politics, then you're just going to live at an irrelevant life. And we can't have that. So he was in many ways the philosophical architect of the Holocaust. Again, not a leftist, not a Marxist, although he dabbled in it. You find that so from a lot of these, right? Collectivists the writing galleons that they dabbled. Guys like Verner some Bart, right? He was once a communist who later became a Nazi. Carl Schmitt dabbled in and leftism and then went full. Right? Um, and it was in many ways the culmination of the writing galleon ideology in crossfit. So it's a book worth reading and contemplating. And I would say to anybody who rejects liberalism, you know, be honest about where you're going with this.

Speaker 2:          17:47          This is the opposite of the celebration of death in the quirks of crush Schmidt, very powerful thinker, highly regarded, even today worth reading and worth reflecting on what kind of world do you want to live in to live in peace with others. Where do you want a slot at your friends, a slaughter your enemies and rally with your friends. So move me from that point 1930s into of course, obviously into Nazi Germany and, and then we'll, we'll finish where we, yeah, and, and you know, my book really does it 1958 not necessarily. It didn't have to, but I started to get really queasy about what happened after World War II. A lot of the writing Gelien movement went underground, you know, um, and, and became a kind of a, a quiet neo Nazi movement that never really had access to social media that clearly weren't in academia, obviously.

Speaker 2:          18:40          And, but the ideology never entirely went away. And, and it was just lying in, wait, wait, waiting for the failure of the left and for the resentment of the population against the left to rise up and receive would get a fever. It enough pitch that it would, it would then, ah, come on full force. And that's really what's happening in Europe. Russia, United States, it's an alternative form of collectivism has got a different flavor, a different orientation, a different kind of resentments, but it's still drags in this gigantic history of writing Ghillean ideology, the celebration of the Dick, great man, dictator, the protectionism, the anti-immigration, the nativism, the nationalism that could take any one of five forms, including the racism. Um, what do you make about how now, and it's obviously largely because of the Internet. It seems to be happening in so many places at once.

Speaker 2:          19:34          We're seeing this unholy. It's an oddly unholy alliance between the collectivists left and then that drives it made. It's exactly what you're saying. Then you've got this other thing that's just waiting there for these guys to go to bananas. I was like, oh, we got all these answers. Meanwhile you have the liberals and everyone, all the decent 80% of us that are trying to live and let live. Part of it really comes down to this. There's a weird sociological, cultural contradiction at the heart of social democratic leftist ideology. On one hand they, they wanted to build gigantic institutions that are redistributed worry and we're supposed to treat each other like a big family and we're supposed to have this homogeneous nation state and the other hand they're celebrating diversity and encouraging mass immigration and heterogeneous populations, and guess what? Those don't really work together. So you build gigantic institute, gigantic states that presume sort of that we're all one family.

Speaker 2:          20:28          And then you throw in this, this, this diverse set of people, especially with the refugee crisis in Europe and immigration in the United States, and people are looking around going down these people at my family, I don't even like these. Yeah. And yet I'm paying for them. That is a prescription. I mean that, that blows up. I'm, that's a disaster. It's a powder keg. And so it was the left and there's this core contradiction that they have between on a welfare state on one hand, and there's celebration and Hetero heterogeneous populations on the other welfare state and diversity. They don't, they don't work. And that basically puts us where Germany sort of is at right now, right. Where they said, okay, 3 million people come on in. Now all these people are going to have to pay for you. We're not going to integrate you properly. I mean, this is not only, you know, you've got that I did to Terrian movements rising up in Germany and in Hungary and of course in Russia in, and of course the US, you know, so it all just kind of follows.

Speaker 2:          21:17          It's, it's inevitable. The left created this, I mean, if, if after World War II we had just embraced liberalism by, we should have, like, we should have, we wouldn't be where we are today, but we have another chance. And that's why you're here. And that's why I'm here. We have another chance now to, to re-embrace liberal liberal theory and to, and to reject the left are, and don't feel yourself just because of the enemy of your enemy is there. It doesn't mean it has to be your friend. I mean, we really do need to think of ourselves as kind of a, uh, dissidence from a political culture that, that rally around freedom and human rights and universal human rights and, and the noble meant of humanity, the champion of the common person, uh, the rights of everyone to live freely with each other, to, to gain value from each other.

Speaker 2:          22:04          And to live in peace and stop thinking of our, of our fellow human beings as possible enemies. We don't want to get drafted into this, the political world that call Schmidt. Imagine for us, as I was describing crossfit, you, you see it happening, right? That Schmitty in view to slice and dice the population. Who Do you like? Who Do you hate? You know who is, who are your people? It's, this is not a good life. Yeah. And we feel like chopping away at both sides, right? Yeah, we do. We feel it. And so we don't, I just don't feel like we have to be part of it. I mean, as best we can, uh, let's find things we love, you know, and go places. We love me with people who love of all different backgrounds, all different kinds of cultures. Learn about alternative religions, learn, learn about new ways to do things, travel, right?

Speaker 2:          22:49          And the age of liberalism, there were no such things as passports, you know? All right, so let's, let's spend the last portion here on just these last five years really here in America, because I remember just even, it doesn't have to be the last five years, but let's say even three years ago, just, it's sort of the emergence of Trump as a candidate when people started saying the phrase, all right. Yeah. And I did a bunch of videos on it where I was basically saying, I see two strains to this thing and people are now using this video against me. And what I saw was there was the sort of fun money makers and the, all of the people who were having fun online doing often doing awful things and Nazi imagery just to upset people in power and whatever. But sometimes very fun things too.

Speaker 2:          23:35          And funny things. But I saw it like just the real sort of shit posters as they're known in the pet pay people. The whole idea was we could get, we can start sending a frog to some like intellectual and they're gonna think that's a racist thing. And then they would, they would say, I'm being under attack from racist. Like they would actually give them exactly what they want it. So I saw this, this sort of fun shit posting whatever part of it. Not to say it didn't have elements I didn't like, but there were, I saw that as the bulk of it. And then alongside of that, was this that you're talking about the identitarian part, the true racist part, the part that had been sort of underground for a long time and then because of social media now is finding that it could, yeah.

Speaker 2:          24:15          Actually you influence people and beat it up. Okay. And now and you know, and I think the media really fueled both of those things because basically when Hillary said that deplorables comment, she, she just lumped the whole damn thing together. And I think if she had not said that, I think it's very possible she be president. Aoun should help the Kashi almost made though. Right? Exist. So my question really is, how would you just define the alt right flat out? If I asked you right now, because I think the definition has changed and has it, but if I asked you right now, in, in the summer of 2018 the definition, you, the phrase all right, comes about what, 10 years ago, I think it was coined by Paul God prayed who himself as a follower of met. Yeah. Um, I, I would rather look at this as a, as, as a writer, Galleon collectivist movement, you know, and, and general that stretches from the early 19th century all the way up to the present that's characterized by love of dictatorship, a love of power, protectionist trade policy, nativist immigration policy and [inaudible], and a resentment against the commercial life because it's because it's, it's, it's too heterogeneous into an ennobling of humanity.

Speaker 2:          25:24          I mean that too. To me, the alt right is one species, I guess you could say. One flavoring, one instanciation yeah. Of a much larger problem that stretches way back, which is an illiberal theory of, of life in liberal theory of, of, um, of, of politics. So that's, I think the right way to think about it. My first time I heard Trump speak was July, 2015 and, and I don't even think we were using the term alt right at the time, but he opened his speech with, um, the immigrants are a problem. I thought, hmm. Then there was protection of their foreign goods protections when you protection some. I thought, hmm, that's third big point was I can fix everything. This is all sounding strangely familiar to me. You know, that's, that's like the three pillars of a writer Galleon ideology essentially. And, um, I realized we had a problem and I understand, I do, why people had a high regard for him.

Speaker 2:          26:20          He was going to save us from, from the problems that Obama had created. And God knows those problems. And, and the left has gotten just bonkers, right? So we need, we need protection from that. But he introduced his own form of problems and he unleashed it's own form of, of dangerous and, and potential, potentially very despotic arrangements of power. And some ways are more insidious because they appeal to bourgeoisie. The left is always been a little bit culturally as strange, you know, from, from mainstream of American life. Whereas Trump connects very closely with it. This is why fascist movements have been oftentimes much more successful than, than left socialist once I got to get this, because I would have thought the opposite. So if you, if you would have asked me before you said that, I would say the left is the one that is understood the culture part of this, at least in the American piece of this.

Speaker 2:          27:14          Certainly academia and culture, what you could and couldn't joke about that all agriculture. Yeah, the left is as high except you know, I mean, socialist ideology never came from below. It was never working man's philosophy. It was always an mental, I was always the intellectual. So it was a top down rule. There's always the ruling class that hatched associates, socialist ideology. They never would have been. It's communism, socialism, all these things without the intellectual class. But fascism, if you'll allow me to use that term, uh, kind of flips the narrative a little bit. It's more, it's much more of a from below that you can keep your religion, you can keep your nationhood, your identity, your race, your language, rally around your friends, your family, you know, all the things that you believe are true. You and, and, and, and, and, and within me as a person, as a leader, I will, I will embody all your values and collected by us in a way that that means something important, that, that connects with who you are.

Speaker 2:          28:11          So in that sense, it's a very effective, uh, way of being in liberal. All right? So all that said, what is our way out of this precarious position? I, I think I get what you're yeah, I get the theme of what you're doing here. I have is we have to just keep fighting for what we [inaudible] be better. Well, so Dave, I think we need to rethink who we are. I think we need to deepen and enrich our understanding of who we are and what we're here to do. And it goes back centuries. I mean, it was the liberalism. That dog is out of feudalism that ended the guilds that brought us free trade, that ended slavery, that really gave bursts and modern world. And we need to learn to take credit for that and make that ethos our ethos. Go back and read the works of Adam Smith and the greatest cautious Scottish enlightenment thinkers, you know, and and understand our history so we understand ourselves better.

Speaker 2:          29:09          I think this is important because maybe it stopped thinking of ourselves even though we are radicals. I think you are. I think I am. I almost believe that we should stop thinking of ourselves that way. We should think of ourselves as normal. If I'm a radical, then the phrase radical, it's definitely not as cool as it used to. I mean, I think I'm open to these ideas and I w I guess being, being open right now and lit, being really living up to the ideals that you've set forth here is radical these days. It kind of is. And maybe liberalism has always been a radical creed because it opposes power. It always been opposed to power. And that's what we have to do now. But we also have to celebrate regular life. You know, we have to, we have to celebrate the good life and the beautiful things and the things we love, the people we love in the choices that we can make and the technologies we can use.

Speaker 2:          29:54          And I, I fall in love with the new technology. Every single day I came over, I came over to see you. Or with this new funny pillow that I bought for $10 on Amazon, it allows me to sleep, sitting and stayed up. But I'm been raptured by that. I think this is the way to happiness and I think ultimately is the path to political victory for us to, to be, to be more hopeful, to be more cheerful, to be more, to celebrate life and celebrate love and celebrate wealth in a way in which neither left or the right or doing right now, it gives us as an opening to be awesome, to emancipate the world. We can do this. I've got nothing better to do for more on Jeffrey. Follow him on Twitter. Jeffrey, a talker.
