00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.040
BARACK OBAMA:
Fighting this disease

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.580
had to be a national
security priority.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.370
INTERVIEWER: In the
middle of this village,

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.890
we have Ebola victims.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.590
And there are two or three
here, these women and their baby

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.670
daughter and another
man just down the road.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.590
And they are all believed
to have the virus.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.100
They're just being left here.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.310
CECILIA ROUSE: The overall
goal of the Modern Plaques

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.140
Conference is to bring
together many people

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.490
from many different
perspectives, different fields,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.500
different occupations to have
an important conversation

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.830
about global health.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.970
We chose the topic of Ebola,
not to necessarily just focus

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.800
on Ebola, but
because it provides

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.440
a lens through
which we can discuss

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.760
many of the critical
issues facing many aspects

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.720
of global health today.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.090
CHRISTOPHER
EISGRUBER: There have

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.480
been a lot of conferences
on the Ebola crisis

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.510
on some of the public
health issues related to it.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.090
This particular conference
is different in that it

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.790
takes an interdisciplinary
view of the issues

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.960
and brings to bear a broad
range of disciplines.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.520
History, economics, policy
science, political science,

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.380
molecular biology,
draws them together

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.680
and draws not only on academics,
but also on policymakers

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.500
from NGOs and from government.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.170
KEITH WAILOO: I think
one of the lessons

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.020
that previous health care,
global health crises,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.460
can teach us is the omnipresence
of overreaction driven by fear,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.940
misunderstanding, confusion,
and the imperfections

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.160
of our political processes.

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.450
ADEL MAHMOUD: We were
caught unprepared,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.940
unprepared to detect
a disease happening

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.170
in a new area with
strong features.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.770
We had no drugs.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.160
We had no vaccines.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.030
We had really very little
public health measures.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.490
ANGUS DEATON: Anything you
might do is going to cost money,

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.390
and that money has to
come from somewhere.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.710
I think the simplicity
that when people

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.280
are in trouble, if you throw
money at it, that will fix it.

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.330
We know that, that's
not really right.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.540
JANET CURRIE: We like to
think about the crisis being

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.070
over when people
stop falling ill,

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.460
but as we're
discovering survivors

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.640
have a range of problems
that are going to be

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.560
with them for a long time.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.040
From what we know from a
variety of other circumstances,

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.940
children who are impacted
by this type of disaster

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.850
will bear long-term
effects, and that

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.730
should be kept in mind when
thinking about to aid them

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:54.680
down the road.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.640
AMANEY JAMAL: The takeaway
from this conference

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.640
will be the macro perspective
on how epidemic diseases are

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.120
conquered and how effective
policies are designed,

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.470
but you'll get a perspective
from a historical perspective,

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.230
a political perspective.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.540
You'll get a sense of how
the science and the health

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.330
care behind this or the
health research behind this.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:17.680
You get a sense of the cost
underlying these responses.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.240
So the nice thing about this
conference is that in one place

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.170
you'll have all
these conversations,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.310
all this engagement and social
engagement, that will be useful

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.510
for scholars and
[? policymakers ?]

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.230
in terms of how they think
about the spread of epidemic

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.100
diseases.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.130
And to have that world view
of all these moving parts

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.230
in one place is why this
conference is so valuable.
