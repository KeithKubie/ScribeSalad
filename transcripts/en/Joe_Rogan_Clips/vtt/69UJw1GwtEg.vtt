1
00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.880
The Joe Rogan experience.
So you get the key from this guy's car,
right?

2
00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:08.430
You can't use the APP.
Right.
So you,

3
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.590
you have to rely on the software in the state that it's out.

4
00:00:11.591 --> 00:00:15.060
There is no software updates.
No.
So here's a,
here's a long story.

5
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.160
So get the car going.
Everything's great.

6
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.080
In order to get mask mask from the TUSLA system.

7
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.170
So there's a certain system that the Tesla knows we're all their cars are and

8
00:00:25.171 --> 00:00:27.270
they could disable whatever they want.
They can do whatever they want.

9
00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:28.920
They see now.
Exactly.

10
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.780
So I had to reach out to like this Tesla black hat hacker pretty much.
Oh Jesus.

11
00:00:33.781 --> 00:00:37.620
You will go to the dark web.
I had to go to the deep dark web and um,

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.130
and he was able to mask Tulsa from seeing the car,

13
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:44.580
which is why can't have the Tesla App.
Oh.
So he matched that.

14
00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.810
So he got into the actual software itself in the actual software.

15
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.150
Tell guys a genius is Phil switched one to zero.
Exactly.

16
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.210
It took a bit and then it was able to be,
uh,
the car could supercharge a car,

17
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.330
could do everything.
I can do.
And the car gets updates too.
It's great.
Oh,
it does.

18
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:03.990
It does get updates.
Yeah.
And Tesla doesn't know it's getting updates.
No.

19
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:06.540
You know what's funny?
We shouldn't say this.
I'm just kidding.
Now they,

20
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.310
they know the deal.
And here's,
here's the problem with that is that,
um,

21
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.670
people love these cars a lot.
Man That didn't love these cars,
you know,
hence me,

22
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:17.760
I'm picking the car like a dirty lake,
you know what I mean?
In fixing this thing,

23
00:01:17.761 --> 00:01:19.650
you know what I mean?
So it's,

24
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.210
it's a lot of the times it's in their best interest,
I believe,

25
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:27.690
to help people out a little bit.
Um,
but,
but no,

26
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:30.120
the things that people go through for these cars is insane and people just,

27
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.640
they just love them.
My take on it is,

28
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.670
th what they have is this ingenious company with this mad genius scientist who's

29
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:40.710
running it,
who does a million other things at the same time.

30
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.170
And they don't have enough people to deal with someone like you.

31
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.041
They probably just don't,

32
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.760
they don't have like a section of the company to deal with someone like you.

33
00:01:50.761 --> 00:01:52.610
They,
do you remember when he was working,
when he was,

34
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.710
they were trying to put out the model three and he was working 16 hours a day

35
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:57.390
and sleeping on the floor and the cabinetry.
Yeah,

36
00:01:57.391 --> 00:02:00.270
pretty much shit that don't make any sense.
The people,
you know,

37
00:02:00.271 --> 00:02:04.020
it's funny people,
it doesn't make any sense,
but people love the company.

38
00:02:04.021 --> 00:02:08.520
They love this guy.
So,
so Cigna that um,
when he was working 16 hours a day,

39
00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.490
uh,
and he was sleeping on the floor in the factory,
right.
You know,

40
00:02:11.491 --> 00:02:13.950
it was a big sob story of billion years to be on the floor.
The factory,

41
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.440
a bunch of Tesla owners rallied together and they purchased a couch for him to

42
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:23.010
sleep on like tens of thousands of dollars.

43
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.550
What kind of couches they must than a nice ass count.
Crazy could be the way.

44
00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:26.940
Like they,

45
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.560
they rallied and they purchased a couch for him and like I made a video on it.

46
00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.110
I said to myself,
you know what?
This guy's a billionaire in B.

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.210
But the fact that everyone rallied together to help this guy to show that their

48
00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:42.990
support people are hands over fist with this company.
Man,
they are heels.

49
00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.920
It reminds me of apple back in the day.
Uh,
you know,

50
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.750
I remember there was a,
God,
God bless his heart who uh,

51
00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.830
was one of the editors on news radio,

52
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.660
the a sitcom that was on the 90s and he was such an apple head that he was like,

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.710
he was talking about it like it was a sports team who's was talking about it.

54
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.700
Well I think we're really going to get those PC guys team when the MAC books

55
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:11.410
come out but keep it.
But he really said something to that all along those lines.

56
00:03:11.411 --> 00:03:14.190
I think we're really gonna pull ahead.
Like who's we,

57
00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.820
we meet users where they were on this weird little tribe.

58
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:20.770
Mac and this is the same thing,
but you know what?

59
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.170
You don't picture the apple fan boys at Tesla Fan boys times 10.

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.390
Yeah,
they live in it.
It's like an apple.
You live in,

61
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.220
it's times 10 Trevena working cause not because apple has a technology aspect of

62
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:36.490
it,
like it's great.
You know android socks,
I have an apple phone.
Okay,
perfect,

63
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:41.290
perfect.
But for Teslas,
you're talking about technology.
So you have a tech nerds,

64
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.980
you're talking about sustainability as well.
For the green people,
Greens,

65
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
you have the tech and the green people and once they joined forces the scariest

66
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:53.950
force on the earth.
Right.
It isn't like war,
like guns and stuff.

67
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.270
It's actually a Mac owning Tesla vegan owner.

68
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.080
Yeah.
It's the scariest thing in the way.

69
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:04.390
It really is a serious thing in the world because they'll tell you all about it

70
00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:09.070
at a party.
Oh,
got it cornered.
They get corner.
But like they,
it and it's,

71
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.280
and I've struggled with that in a lot of cases because whenever I say something

72
00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.480
remotely negative about Tessa,
like,
Hey,
I think Tesla could do a better job here.

73
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.260
They're just like,
you're just a gas head.
I know you own a zoo.
Six,

74
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.830
you work for big one.
So I want to QT working for big oil.
Oh you do?
Yeah.

75
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.730
What do you do for them?
How do you work for the coil?
What does that mean?

76
00:04:27.731 --> 00:04:31.440
You work for big oil.
Yeah.
You A,
you're a part of the Illuminati.
Yeah,

77
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.020
pretty much.
That's like I just,
yeah.
You worked for big oil.
Well,

78
00:04:35.021 --> 00:04:36.610
how do it for big oil?
What does that,
what does that mean?

79
00:04:36.611 --> 00:04:40.210
How much could they pay you to,
first of all,
before people would realize it,

80
00:04:40.211 --> 00:04:43.040
all of a sudden you're walking around with like diamond chains on shit.

81
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.900
Think it'd be moved to a giant mansion.
Right?
You still fixing cars?
Yeah.

82
00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.500
Do you want for big oil?
You know,
I've got another thing going on.
Right?
Right.

83
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.950
Am I cutting billions for big oil?
Yeah.
By by a gas car.
Go to shell.

84
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:56.210
Shell's Great.
I don't understand how people think that the,

85
00:04:56.211 --> 00:04:59.350
that whole shield thing works.
Did you just get like a monthly check?

86
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.290
I don't understand.
Like hey rich,
say something negative about Tufts.

87
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.940
Every once in a while we'll give you a check for 20 grand.

88
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.080
You got to get that big oil check.

89
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.950
I suspect that what it is is similar to what my friend who was really addicted

90
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.430
to apple.
Yeah.
I think you just get on your tribe.
And that's my thing.

91
00:05:12.431 --> 00:05:15.150
I'm all about apple and as your camp windows or it's bullshit.

92
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.320
When this was bullshit,
what you want to play,

93
00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.520
what are you going to fuck with the config files?
Get in there and then use dos.

94
00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.200
Get outta here.
Yeah,
you lose it a loser.

95
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.460
But it's interesting because people like us are very different because we could

96
00:05:27.461 --> 00:05:31.810
appreciate both.
You have a phenomenal collection of cars.
Thank you.
And um,

97
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.650
and then you threw a Tesla in there,
but you love both.
Like you love the driving.

98
00:05:35.651 --> 00:05:38.890
You left the driving aspect of video of your Porsche.
You know,
you love,
you know,

99
00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.790
the,
the,
the silence and the,
the zero to 60 of your Tesla too.
So like you could,

100
00:05:42.791 --> 00:05:46.690
we could be part of both camps,
but a lot of cases they're only,
it's camp Tesla.

101
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.940
And if you're not with us,
you're against us.
