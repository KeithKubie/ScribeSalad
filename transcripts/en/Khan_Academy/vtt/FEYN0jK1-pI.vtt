00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
My wife is looking at me kind
of strange right now.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.350
So forgive me if I have a
problem doing some of these

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.460
problems. But anyway,
problem 177.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.770
She said she wanted to observe
me making videos.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.310
Let's see how this goes.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:14.270
Do you want to say hi?

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.100
No, no, OK.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.670
No, I'm not going
to record it.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.100
A company accountant estimates
that airfares next year for

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.880
business trips of 1,000 miles or
less will increase by 20%.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.990
So less than 1,000 miles.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.509
Airfares next year going
are going to go up 20%.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.920
And for all other business
trips, it

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.460
will increase by 10%.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.340
So essentially greater than or
equal to 1,000 miles, airfare

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.690
is going to increase by 10%.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.630
This year total airfares for
business trips of 1,000 miles

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.790
or less were $9,900.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.250
So that's the total for
1,000 miles or less.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.480
And airfares for all
other business

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.790
trips were 13,000 miles.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.965
According to the accountant's
estimate, if the same number

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:01.020
of business trips will be made
next year as this year, how

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.739
much will be spent for
airfares next year?

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.120
I have a problem with what they
say, because they say the

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.580
same number of business trips.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.020
But we really, I'm thinking,
have to assume that not only

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.120
are the same number of business
trips made, but the

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.580
allocation between less than
1,000 and greater than 1,000

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.420
is also going to have
to be the same.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.860
But anyway, let's just do what
I think they're assuming.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.620
So essentially you just have
to take the $9,900 and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.950
increase it by 20%.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.090
9,900 times 1.2.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.900
And then add that to the 13,000
increased by 10%.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490
So 1.1 times 13,000.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.945
That's a 13, not a B.

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:41.195
So let's see.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's just write 9,900
times 1.2.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.010
2 times 0 is 0.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.110
2 times 0 is 0.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.730
2 times 9 is 18.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.730
2 times 9, 18, plus 1 is 19.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.290
Add a 0 and then
you have 9,900.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:09.560
0, 0, 9, 9-- scroll down--
0, 0, 8, 9 plus 9 is

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.900
18, 2 plus 9 is 11.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.780
And we have one number
behind the decimal.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.660
So that's 11,880.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.760
And then 1.1 times 13,000.

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.050
So it's 13,000 times 1.1.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:38.480
1 times 13,000 is 13,000, 0,
1 times 13,000 is 13,000.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.050
0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 1.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.210
And we have one number
behind the decimal.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.630
So it's 14,300.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.560
And if we were to add
these two together.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.680
Let's see, if I add 11,880
to this, I get 0, 8.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.620
3 plus 8 is 11.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.810
So, 26,180.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.210
And that's choice B.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.600
Next problem.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.610
Problem 178.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:24.910
If x star y is equal to xy minus
2 times x plus y, for

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:28.616
all integers x and y,
then what does 2

00:03:28.616 --> 00:03:32.340
star minus 3 equal?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.130
So we essentially just have
to do pattern matching.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.570
Everywhere we see an x here,
we substitute with 2.

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.165
And everywhere we see a y, we
substitute with minus 3.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:42.580
And just to be clear, this isn't
an equal, that's a minus

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.420
right there.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:55.260
So it's 2 times minus 3, minus
2 times 2, plus minus 3.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.600
2 times minus 3 is minus 6.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.425
Minus 2 times 2 plus
minus 3 is minus 1.

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:04.880
That's the same thing
as 2 minus 3.

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.250
And let's see, you have a minus
and a minus, so we can

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.640
make those both plus.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.750
So you have minus 6 plus 2.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.550
When you multiply it by 1,
that's the same thing.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:17.160
So minus 6 plus 2 is
equal to minus 4.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.435
And that is choice C.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:22.890
Problem 179.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.670
I'll switch colors to
ease the monotony.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.080
179, the table above shows the
number of students in the 3

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.530
clubs at [? McCullough ?]

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.975
School.

00:04:32.975 --> 00:04:34.720
So let me write the table.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.970
So they have the club.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.935
And they say the number
of students.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.060
And they have chess, drama,
and math clubs.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:58.510
The chess club has 40 students,
drama has 30, and

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.880
math has 25.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.210
The table above shows the number
of students in 3 clubs

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.850
at [? McCullough ?]

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:04.660
School.

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.610
Although no student is in all
3 clubs, 10 students are in

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.095
both chess and drama.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.270
I feel a Venn diagram
coming on.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:18.680
10 students are in both
chess and drama.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.906
5 students are in both
chess and math.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.800
And 6 students are in
both drama and math.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.090
How many different students
are there in the 3 clubs?

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.140
Yeah, I think we need to
do a Venn diagram.

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.870
So let's draw the chess students
first in yellow.

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:45.706
Actually I'm not going to do
circles, because I think I

00:05:45.706 --> 00:05:46.990
have to draw it a little
bit different.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.270
Because there's no students
in all 3 clubs.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.600
So let's say that this
is the chess club.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.160
There's 40 people in that.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.520
And let's do drama next.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:03.840
There are 30 students
in the drama club.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.590
And then how many people
are in both?

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:06.810
Well they told us that
there are 10 people

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:07.840
in chess and drama.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.240
So this is right here is 10.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:14.010
And then let's draw math.

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.890
So math will intersect
with both of these.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:18.950
It looks like that.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.610
Math has a total
of 25 students.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:30.900
And their overlap with
math and drama is 6.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:37.150
And the overlap with math
and chest is 5.

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.530
So the main question we have to
ask is, if we were to add

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.820
up all of these-- if we were to
add up the 40 plus the 30

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.550
plus the 25-- how many
times are we counting

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:46.355
each of these sections?

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:48.270
So let's just try that, because
we just want to know

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.210
the total number of students
in 3 clubs.

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.750
So let's take the 40.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:57.200
We're already counting this 10
once, right, because they're

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.490
in that 40.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.890
So let's add the 30.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:03.990
So 40 plus 30.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.800
If we add the 40 plus the 30,
we're double counting this 10

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.100
that's in both clubs.

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.250
So if we were to subtract one
of them, this number right

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.160
here is the number of students
in the chess and

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.140
drama clubs, right?

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.570
So that is-- what is that-- that
is 40 plus 30 minus 20.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:22.910
That's 60 students.

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:25.750
So 60 students in
chess and drama.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:32.650
And now if we add 25 students--
so we're adding the

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.870
math club to that-- who are
we double counting?

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.340
Now we're double counting these
6 that we've already

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.000
counted right?

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.620
Because we added them in the
30 from the drama club.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.110
And we're also double counting
these 5, which we added when

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.710
we first took into account the
40 from the chess club, right?

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:52.760
So since we've already counted
those, we need to subtract

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.870
those from the 25.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.970
So minus 5 and minus 6.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:59.480
This problem is all about
not double counting.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:04.430
So let's see, 60 plus
25 is 85, minus 5 is

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.580
80, minus 6 is 74.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:11.010
So 74 total students.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:15.020
So that's choice C.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:21.170
Problem 180.

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:24.010
In a nationwide poll, N people
were interviewed.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.480
So question number one.

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.190
That's in the question,
question number 1.

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:35.549
So it said for question number
1, 1/4 said yes.

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:42.636
And of those, 1/3 answered
yes to question 2.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:49.610
Which of the following
expressions represents the

00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:51.850
number of people interviewed
who did not

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.560
answer yes to both questions?

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.520
OK, so first of all, you have
the people who answered no to

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:02.960
question 1.

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.590
So that was 3/4 of the
people, right?

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:08.620
No on question 1.

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:11.510
And who cares what they answered
on question 2, right?

00:09:11.510 --> 00:09:15.350
Because they definitely said
no to one of the questions.

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:16.830
Because they want to
say who did not

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:18.420
answer yes to both questions?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:20.010
So these guys fall into
that category.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.560
They said no to one
of the questions.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.270
And then you want to say, what
percentage of the total people

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:28.420
said yes on the first question
and then no on the second?

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.510
That combination would be if 1/3
of the people who said yes

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.340
on the first question, said
yes on the second,

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.560
then 2/3 said no.

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.360
And what percentage, or what
fraction is this of the entire

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.930
population?

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.250
Well it's 2/3 of 1/4.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:50.460
So that is 2/3 times 1/4
is equal to, 1, 2.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:53.500
That's equal to 1/6.

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.950
1/6 of the entire population
said yes on the first and no

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:57.750
on the second.

00:09:57.750 --> 00:10:00.790
So if we were to add these two
up, these are people who said

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:06.410
no in either or both questions,
you get 1/6 plus

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:10.860
3/4 is equal to-- let's give a
common denominator of 12-- so

00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:18.570
that's 2/6 plus 3/4,
that is 9/12.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:22.850
So that is 11/12.

00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:25.350
Oh, there were N people
interviewed.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.890
So 11/12 of the people did not
answer yes to both questions.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:32.820
And so if they want to know
the number of people, you

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:36.140
would say 11/12 times the total
population, which is N.

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.240
So 11N over 12.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.630
And that's choice E.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:42.680
And my wife is still
staring at me.

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:43.930
See you in the next video.
