I don't have to work

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:05.805 align:end position:100%
and I can just run errands
and look like trash.

- I know.
I'm not even wearing underwear.

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:08.775 align:start size:59% position:41%
- Yeah, me neither.

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:10.209 align:end position:100%
I mean, I'm not seeing
anybody I know,

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.344 align:start size:47% position:53%
so why would I?

00:00:11.377 --> 00:00:12.645
- I actually probably should.

00:00:12.678 --> 00:00:15.381 align:start position:0%

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.352 align:start position:0%
It's so embarrassing.

00:00:19.385 --> 00:00:20.686 align:end position:100%
- Why? Everyone knows
you have a butthole

00:00:20.719 --> 00:00:22.221 align:start size:78% position:22%
and poop comes out of it.

00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:24.057 align:start position:0%
- Hey, you're okay.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.391 align:end position:100%
- See?
She agrees.

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.794
- Hey, gay.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:29.695 align:end position:100%
- Huh, not sure
that's about your butthole.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.164 align:end position:100%
But, I mean,
I guess kinda?

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:32.532 size:78% position:39%
- Wait, what is going on?

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.467

from that video.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.170
- Oh, no, sorry.
I don't think so.
