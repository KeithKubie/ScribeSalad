00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.880
Okay so Michaell here's the tree version, of what I just

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:07.380
said. So remember I draw squares as chance nodes. And so,

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.880
chance takes a, chance. And half the time we end up

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.700
in a state, where I have, where A has a red card.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.480
And half the time I end up in a state where

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.760
A has, or we end up in a state, where A has

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.260
a black card. Okay? If A has the black card. Then

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.240
B gets to choose whether to hold or not, so let me

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.850
add a little bit of color for you since you wanted

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.540
some color. This is the place where A gets to make a

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.530
decision. Okay. Yep. And then this is the place where B

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.440
gets to make a decision. Got it. Okay? So, A is going

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.740
to either be in a red state or a black state.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.110
Only A knows this. B does not know this, does not know

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.460
what state He is in. And so let's say A is

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.650
in a black state. Well, A can only hold in that case.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.060
In part because it makes no sense to resign. And

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.290
then B gets to decide whether to resign, and therefore

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.360
A gets ten cents or to see, in which case

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.750
A gets thirty cents. By contrast, when we're in the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.880
red state A can either hold or resign. If A

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.960
resigns he loses 20 cents. If A holds then B

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.070
gets to decide whether to resign and which case A

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.800
gets 10 cents, or to see the card in which case

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.240
A loses 40 cents and B of course gains 40 cents. So this

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.460
is just a tree version of what I just wrote. Does that make sense?

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.010
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah I can see how this kind of captures the flow of information but

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.720
I feel like there might be a missing

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.250
constraint to it. So [INAUDIBLE] I don't know if

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.690
there's actually a constraint in this thing but

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.870
let me just point out something. And that

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.110
is that B has no idea which of

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.570
these two states his in, and its hidden information.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.840
&gt;&gt; And because B doesn't know what

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.230
states he's in. He doesn't know whether resign over see. In particular B knew

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.010
that he was in this left mode state then he would always say see.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.700
If B knew he was always in the rightmost state, then he would always

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.080
resign. But he doesn't know which one, so it's not entirely clear what to do.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.931
&gt;&gt; Neat! Where did you get this game? This game is awesome! .

00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:01.081
&gt;&gt; I got this game like I got all

00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:03.750
of the examples that we're using today, from Andrew Moore.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:04.930
&gt;&gt; He's clever.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.000
&gt;&gt; He is clever. And

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.150
I have shamelessly stolen... All of his examples

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:11.300
and materials for this. But he said it was

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.450
okay, by putting up slides in the world and

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.300
saying, feel free to steal all of the stuff.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.210
&gt;&gt; You want to write his name so that people can credit him?

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.380
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to write it at the very end. When we talk about.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.570
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.120
&gt;&gt; What we've learned.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.480
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.680
&gt;&gt; Okay. So here's a question for you Michael. We know that I wrote down

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.470
a bunch of words which describe the game, and then I made it a tree,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.200
because I could do that. And it makes it nice and easy

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.530
to see what's going on. But now we know, that at least

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.470
everything else we've done. We want to make a little matrix. And so

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.050
we want to figure out what the value is for different strategies for A

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.750
and B. So I'm going to assert, and I think it's pretty

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.550
easy to see, I hope. That A basically has only two strategies. Either

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.610
A is the type of person that resigns when a card is

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.610
read. Or A is the type of person who holds, when a card

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.750
is read. Agreed?

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.180
&gt;&gt; Interesting, okay. Yeah. Right. So

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.570
it really is a conditional policy, right?

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.390
It's basically If red hold to resign, if black hold to resign, but your

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.520
point is that black isn't really a choice, red is a choice, and

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:13.340
there's only two choices. Okay I can see that as the two strategies sure.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.400
&gt;&gt; Right and of course this does say,

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.340
this is, this does kind of say when you're

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.400
in the black case you know you're going

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.840
to hold. So you know what's going to happen. Ultimately

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.060
B can either be the kind of person who resigns,

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.930
whenever A holds or chooses to see, whenever A holds. Right?

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.060
&gt;&gt; I see so, like in the previous trees. B would have four different

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.370
strategies Resigner see in the left state, resigner see in the right state. Here

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.570
there's this kind of extra connection, this

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.380
sort of a quantum entanglement between these

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.990
two states that it, that makes them have to be the same. So there really

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.870
is just those two choices.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.250
&gt;&gt; That's exactly right, although, I probably wouldn't have used

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.510
the phrase quantum entanglement. But yes, there's an entanglement, certainly.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.510
because we can't tell which state we're in. You're either

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.810
going to resign or you're going to see. And you

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.060
just don't know what else to do. Okay so A's

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.850
a resigner or holder. B's a resigner or a seer.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.790
So the question is what numbers go in this matrix?

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.130
And we're going to figure that out by having a quiz.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.550
&gt;&gt; I kind of saw that coming.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.660
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, do you think you can figure this

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.360
out? yeah, yeah. Sure. Sure. Yeah, I think so.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, see, see, see. Yeah, I can

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.300
do that. Okay, cool. So, let's go then. Go.
