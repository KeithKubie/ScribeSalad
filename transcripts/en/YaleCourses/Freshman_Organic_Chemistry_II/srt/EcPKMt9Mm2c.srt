1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:01,711
Uh,

2
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:06,711
so we're talking about a oxidation
oxidizing and reducing reagents and about

3
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:12,150
alcohols and grin yar reactions to make
them. And if we have time at the end,

4
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:16,170
we'll get to a little bit
about green chemistry. Uh,

5
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:17,600
I've,

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,790
maybe you should apologize a little bit
about the last question on the exam. I,

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,310
I got carried away. I wanted to have
something that was relevant and, uh,

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,410
at least historically relevant so that
I could have chosen a better NMR problem

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,000
probably. But I wanted to show you
why it's a neat story. So I had,

10
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,110
I showed you a, during the
exam, this, a dissertation from,

11
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,380
from the University of Michigan in 1921
and notice it's about the color of free

12
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:50,510
radicals. Uh, it was found
originally that the, that the, um,

13
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,660
solutions were colored. Have any of
you ever had a colored solution in lab?

14
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,760
Have you, had any of you ever not
had a colored solution in lab?

15
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:03,900
Right there always colored.
So at first people put no, uh,

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,840
pay no attention to it.
But after they got good at doing it,

17
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:11,780
they observed that the solutions
were colored sort of a yell,

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,200
reddish yellow. But when you s swirled
the thing, the color went away,

19
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:20,520
it was called this, but then it came
back then just swirled it again.

20
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:23,100
It went away and came back,
went away, came back, went away,

21
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,780
came back several times.

22
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,350
And so this was something that required
an explanation of what the color was and

23
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:35,520
how it went away. So on page eight
of this, of this dissertation,

24
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:40,521
there's this thing up on top that as a
sort of a complicated scheme seems so at

25
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:45,090
the time at least, uh, to
explain the color, right?

26
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:49,500
So the idea is that a what, what compound
is a, in this, can you see what it is?

27
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,480
Hey, up at the top left,
let's try fennel, fennel,

28
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,440
fennel, ethane, right. That's what
Gomberg set out to make. Remember.

29
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,200
And then what's to the right of it?
What's B?

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,190
It's to try fennel methyl radicals.
Okay.

31
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:15,000
That's what he decided he had made
on the basis of their reactivity.

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,960
But he's drawn something
else here. Uh, down below it,

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,200
he explains the color by drawing what
we would regard as a resonance structure

34
00:02:26,511 --> 00:02:30,570
of the free radical, which
puts the, the radical, uh,

35
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,560
out on the para position of one of the
benzene rings and draws other double

36
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:38,560
bonds there. Uh, and that's they,

37
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,180
the theory then was that when you had
that double bond and two double bonds

38
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:47,610
conjugated like that,
that caused color, right?

39
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,390
So he explained the color
by saying that it was,

40
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:55,710
that it was what we would say a resonance
form, but he said in equilibrium,

41
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,950
a forum that was colored and the idea
was that the radical was colored but very

42
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:02,410
reactive,

43
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,950
but it was in equilibrium with the dimer
and the dimer was not colored light.

44
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,790
Tetra fennel, methane, right.
Was not color. Okay. But the,

45
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,730
but the monomer reacts
quickly with oxygen.

46
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,350
So when you swirl the flask and
let oxygen get into the solution,

47
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:24,910
it immediately destroys the
colored stuff that in his opinion,

48
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:28,120
the Quinn oid form this,
these double bonds, right?

49
00:03:28,121 --> 00:03:29,680
The resonance structure we would say,

50
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:34,480
but it destroys the free radical
then exhausts the oxygen.

51
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,250
Right.
And then if you let it sit a while,

52
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,120
the color comes back cause the equilibrium
between the dimer and the monomer

53
00:03:43,121 --> 00:03:46,960
reestablishes itself. So the color
gets back. But if you swirl it again,

54
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:48,760
you've got oxygen and it destroys it.

55
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,170
You can keep doing that until you've
used up all the radical. So that was the,

56
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,500
that's how color got into the,
to the act.

57
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,370
Right now, the Nmr I tried, I, I, uh,

58
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,500
asked you to explain and the number of
people got it is the dimer of trifle

59
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,150
mouthful was finally measured by Nmr in,

60
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,650
in 1968. And here's a
spectrum of it. And you see,

61
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:16,630
it can't possibly be hex a fan,

62
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:21,631
I'll ethane because it's got one group
of 25 hydrogens and other have to another

63
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:24,280
of two and another one,
right?

64
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,710
So if we look at Hexcel fan, LFA and of
course you should have six phenol groups,

65
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:33,940
six times five is 30. There should just
be that one peak. So this obviously,

66
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,780
isn't that,

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:40,080
what is it right that x a fennel ethane
is the product of Alpha Alpha coupling,

68
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:46,120
the two radical carbons coming together.
But notice what could have happened.

69
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,010
It's obviously not that,

70
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,060
but if you had the funnel
methyl radical up there at B,

71
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:57,310
and if we use a line instead of a.to
denote the extra valence that's not being

72
00:04:57,311 --> 00:05:01,210
used, and over here draw
the the resonance structure,

73
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:03,550
which has its extra
valence out at the right,

74
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,870
then you could imagine those are of
course it just resonance structures.

75
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,360
But you could imagine two of them coming
together like that to form this dimer.

76
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:14,740
So a different dimer.

77
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,610
What advantage would it
have over what disadvantage,

78
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:20,830
what had have compared
to hexa fennel ethane?

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,650
How about this ring here?

80
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,903
Right?

81
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,460
We've lost the aromatics
stability of the ring, right?

82
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:36,050
What have we gained
in what?

83
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:39,590
So that's a way in which this dimer
would be worse than x, a fennel ethane.

84
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,810
Is there any way in
which it would be better?

85
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,260
It's less sterically
hindered, right? And Spirit.

86
00:05:49,261 --> 00:05:51,780
Kendra's counts for a lot of these things.

87
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,990
Although that was much appreciated
really until after 1950 so,

88
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,880
okay. When people had talked about
it since the time of Victor Meyer,

89
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,150
but it really didn't convince any one
that you should think about another dimer

90
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,490
rather than hexa fennel ethane.
So anyhow, if you think,

91
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:12,080
if you consider this structure,

92
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,470
notice that you have
the explanation for uh,

93
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,660
two hydrogens here, the blue ones,
two hydrogens here, the green ones,

94
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,510
a hydrogen here,
the the red one.

95
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,710
And you have coupling between
these two of about 10 hertz.

96
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,560
So it's a double doublet,
right?

97
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,000
And it's distorted that because the,
that there's 60 megahertz spectrum,

98
00:06:35,001 --> 00:06:39,680
that chemical shift difference isn't
large compared to the, to the j coupling.

99
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,560
So the inner peaks are large
and the outer peaks are small.

100
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,630
But if you look even more carefully,

101
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,390
you can see that there's a three hertz
coupling between the red hydrogen and

102
00:06:48,391 --> 00:06:48,740
degree.

103
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,510
And there's a little bit of doublet
splitting here in a little bit of doublet

104
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:54,980
splitting here. Just it's
hard to see. And in fact,

105
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:56,840
in some related samples,

106
00:06:56,841 --> 00:07:00,050
you can see a little coupling between
this hydrogen and that one as well.

107
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:04,400
And these therefore are a little bit
split, but not enough that you can see it.

108
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:09,110
Why don't you see the splitting in that
one? If a splits be, we should split a,

109
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:17,240
because this hydrogen is being split into
a triplet by these and into us into a

110
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:21,830
small triplet by these only three hertz
and then into even smaller triplets by

111
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,270
these,
right?

112
00:07:23,271 --> 00:07:26,450
So it's just a whole bunch of peaks on
top of one another that just looked like

113
00:07:26,451 --> 00:07:27,470
a lump out here.

114
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,910
So it's quite clear what this structure
is at this that it's this Quinoa dimer

115
00:07:31,911 --> 00:07:35,030
once you have the Nmr to see it.
Okay,

116
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:40,031
so it's a Alpha to para toppling
the central Carbon Alpha,

117
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:44,330
right. Uh, with the Para position
of one of the benzene rings,

118
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:48,380
which are for avoids the steric hindrance.
Now,

119
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,570
how about the color? Remember that the
reason Gomberg thought it was this, this,

120
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:56,150
uh, uh, that it was this,

121
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,020
was that the radical was colored the
stuff that went away rapidly when you

122
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:05,510
swirled it, but the stuff that was in
equilibrium with that was not colored.

123
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,340
That's why the color went away,

124
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:11,120
but came back again when the
equilibrium was reestablished.

125
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,660
So the stuff that was in
equilibrium with was not colored.

126
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,440
This he thought should be colored,
right?

127
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:22,640
So he thought it couldn't be that
dimer and he was almost right.

128
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:26,120
This is the UV spectrum of that stuff.

129
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,720
So it has quite a strong
absorbance here at, uh,

130
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,490
three 18 nanometers,

131
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:36,170
but it Peters out just
at three 95 nanometers.

132
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:39,650
And as it turns out,
the ultraviolet,

133
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:43,820
the invisible part of the spectrum
ends at three 95 nanometers.

134
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,980
If it had been five nanometers more,

135
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,640
he would have seen the color of
that with his eye. So he was close,

136
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:53,840
but no cigar on that one. Right?
And because of that, for, for this,

137
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:58,110
for a whatever it, uh, uh, 46 years,

138
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:03,510
people had the wrong structure of this
important compound. Right now, in fact,

139
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,370
that's at minus 60 degrees where the
equilibrium lies toward the dimer,

140
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,320
away from the monomer. But if you
warm the 21 degrees, now you see the,

141
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,310
the absorption from the, from the
monomer. There's enough of it to see

142
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:24,280
that's at five, 13 nanometers. A S. Okay.

143
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,380
And the reason it's colored is not
because it has this crinoid structure,

144
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,450
which was his theory, but because
it has a non bonding. So Mo,

145
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,630
so normally you have bonding
and anti-bonding orbitals
Pi and Pi Star conjugated

146
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:44,110
ones, right? But this one has a non
bonding orbital right in the middle.

147
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,590
So a much smaller gap.
So the,

148
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,800
so the energy is much lower of the
quantum that gets absorbed by the free

149
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:55,270
radical. Okay. Now, uh,

150
00:09:55,780 --> 00:10:00,720
this was published, did in that,
that thesis that appeared here, uh,

151
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,750
was published the next year in the
Journal of the American Chemical Society.

152
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:08,980
Almost word for word about the
color of the free radicals, right?

153
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,570
And this is the, the passage
of that. It says, uh,

154
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,310
the relationship between
color and constitution to
try fennel methyl or briefly

155
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:23,311
stated the following first that you have
a colored free radical in equilibrium

156
00:10:23,531 --> 00:10:27,520
with the dimer hexa fan.
LFA Right. And second,

157
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,540
the color is attributed
to the Quinn oid tout him,

158
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:33,310
or we would now say resonance structure.
See.

159
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,980
So the color was attributed to that.

160
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:41,310
But notice what's interesting about
taking this paper from the dissertation to

161
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:45,340
the, to the printed form in the
Journal of American Chemical Society,

162
00:10:45,341 --> 00:10:49,000
the published warm,
what got left out,

163
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,280
the correct structure,
the diamond.

164
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,540
So it was intentionally left
out because of this color,

165
00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:04,250
the color thing, they, the, the,

166
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,410
the correct dimer was dropped for 46
years because they thought it should be

167
00:11:08,411 --> 00:11:10,330
colored and it just almost was.

168
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,810
So I think that's an interesting
application of spectroscopy.

169
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:19,810
Okay. Now, third thoughts on the Friedel
crafts reaction. Whenever we had thoughts,

170
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:24,220
we had second thoughts. Uh, now
we have third thoughts. And uh,

171
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,050
the second thoughts just to,

172
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:30,190
to remind you was that when you
do a Friedel crafts reaction,

173
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:35,191
you could imagine benzine
me in a nucleophile and
displacing chloride from an

174
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:38,430
propyl to give and propyl
benzene and [inaudible].

175
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,150
And that would be an sn two reaction.
Or,

176
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,950
or you could imagine if it broke the
bond a little more that the hydride could

177
00:11:44,951 --> 00:11:47,350
shift and you'd get
ice of pro ball either,

178
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,970
either with a aluminum chloride
tightly associated with it.

179
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:55,780
Or since it's a secondary, I
and may be much looser. Okay.

180
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:59,200
So that would be like an sn one
reaction that allowed the rearrangement.

181
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,220
But then we wondered what would happen
if we rotated, didn't had a meth.

182
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:07,210
I'd shift if we couldn't have a hydro.
If we instead of a hydride shift,

183
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,590
then we get the, if we had
the rearrangement, we get
the same thing back again.

184
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:14,530
It was still given propyl.
Uh, so the question is,

185
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:17,140
is it sn two or is it sn one?

186
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:22,120
And then there was this additional
complication that if the methyl got stuck

187
00:12:22,121 --> 00:12:26,230
halfway in a cycle of propyl protonated,
cyclo propane,

188
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,790
a structure that still would give the
end propylene benzine. And in fact,

189
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:35,440
dino found in 1968 that you did that
and that it was randomly distributed

190
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:39,810
because the hydrogen can zip around the
periphery of the protonated cycle of

191
00:12:39,811 --> 00:12:44,290
propane. Okay. So then I pose to you
a way to become famous of problem,

192
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,630
how to decide whether the,

193
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:51,490
whether the Friedel crafts reaction
really is an sn two where benzene is a

194
00:12:51,491 --> 00:12:54,550
nucleophile and displaces
chloride from a thing like this.

195
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:59,440
Either before or after the meth I'd
shift or whether it's an sn one reaction.

196
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,630
Did anyone have an idea how to solve that?

197
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,910
Yeah.
Used to Tyrian.

198
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:13,680
Well, we could label to see where the
deuterium ends up in the end pro ball.

199
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,240
And what I found, since I've posed
you this way, to become a famous,

200
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,690
was it somebody actually
did that experiment, right?

201
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,490
It was done two years later in 1970
and it didn't make them famous,

202
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,600
right?

203
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,600
That the paper has been cited only twice
in the succeeding 40 years or whatever.

204
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,373
Okay.

205
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,740
And it was done by Lee Ann Woodcock in
Saskatchewan in 1970 so they've prepared

206
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:44,430
the one with deuterium here and they did
the reaction with aluminum chloride at

207
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:47,340
five degrees for four
Centigrade for 45 minutes.

208
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,780
That's near the freezing point of benzene.
So it's about,

209
00:13:49,781 --> 00:13:52,350
it's cold as you can get if you're
going to use benzene as a solvent.

210
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:55,140
They also did it with
another inert solvent.

211
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,470
The idea is that that would
slow the nuclear file.

212
00:13:58,471 --> 00:14:01,320
Would that be more dilute the
benzene that's doing the thing.

213
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:05,670
So it would slow down the displacement
reaction if it were an sn two.

214
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,330
Okay.
So what would you expect

215
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:11,580
if it had been

216
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:16,640
an sn two, an sn? Two reaction
without any rearrangement.

217
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,490
If it had just been benzene
being a nucleophile,

218
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,270
the only thing aluminum chloride does
is help the chloride be a good leaving

219
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:26,000
group.
Then where would the deuterium end up

220
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,520
here? Here, here.

221
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,510
One, two, three Australian.

222
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,340
What do you say?

223
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:39,660
We just did the exam.
You should fried on this.

224
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,700
It should be here,
right?

225
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,650
Halted. Benzine just comes to the
taxes. Carbon and chloride leaves.

226
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:52,250
Then the deuterium should all be there.
What if it undergoes a meth?

227
00:14:52,251 --> 00:14:56,570
I'd shift right then
where would it be? Ashby.

228
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,473
Okay.

229
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,050
Material. Remember started
here, right? And then the meth

230
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,120
side shifted. If that's
the maximum. Some, yeah.

231
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,240
Then it would be here.
Right.

232
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,730
And what if it went through a
protonated cycle of propane?

233
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,793
All right?

234
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,670
Then it would be scrambled.

235
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:26,150
I already know what proteinated
cycle appropriate it would be.

236
00:15:26,151 --> 00:15:28,370
So now by studying where the deuterium is,

237
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,440
we should be able to figure out of what
the mechanism is with that to give an

238
00:15:33,441 --> 00:15:36,080
propyl benzene with an propyl chloride.

239
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,410
And what they found was that 90% of the
product was die deuterated there and

240
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:45,980
none of it was die deuterated elsewhere.
Right?

241
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,550
So it really is the case then that there's
less than 2% of partial or full meth.

242
00:15:52,601 --> 00:15:56,240
I'd shift en route to and propyl benzene,
right?

243
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,100
It's just the simplest thing.

244
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:02,720
You think that it's forms by of benzene
nucleophile doing an sn two reaction.

245
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,250
Okay. Now why isn't that a 100%? Uh,

246
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:12,280
because other cad ions are
able to abstract hydride
from this position to make

247
00:16:13,461 --> 00:16:17,930
this cat I had here and then the deuterium
to get washed out of the molecule.

248
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,850
But anyhow, that's, that's uh,
that's what they found. Uh, so,

249
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:23,730
uh,

250
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,530
you'll have to find out some other way
to become famous as an organic chemist.

251
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,013
Okay.

252
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,020
Now at the end last time we were doing
oxidation and reduction as bookkeeping.

253
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:38,810
Uh, not because there's
anything re real about it,

254
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:42,020
but because it could help
us to classify reagents.

255
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,880
We've been classifying reagents as
high homos, low Lumos, weak bonds,

256
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,050
for example, if you want to get
a free radical reaction, uh,

257
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,500
but there's a completely different
way of classify them in a,

258
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:59,240
in us a sense of very artificial way as
to whether they're oxidizing or reducing

259
00:16:59,241 --> 00:16:59,631
agents.

260
00:16:59,631 --> 00:17:04,631
So we went through a whole bunch of
reagents and classified them as oxidizing

261
00:17:04,881 --> 00:17:09,440
reagents. The elemental
halogen die sulfide, uh, uh,

262
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:13,220
chromium trioxide reducing agents.
Uh,

263
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,390
methane is a reducing agent,
but it's,

264
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,060
it's not very reactive because didn't
have good homos are Lumos, right?

265
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,380
Free radicals are what we need to get
a foothold on that or lithium aluminum

266
00:17:24,381 --> 00:17:27,140
hydride h minus sodium hydroxide,

267
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:32,300
potassium metal which can give up
electrons and r s h can give up,

268
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:35,600
uh, uh, can give up a h minus.

269
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,150
And we saw that when you oxidize back
and forth between die sulfide and,

270
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:44,330
and uh, thiol okay. But HCL,

271
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,660
Casey l the elements are in
their normal oxidation states,

272
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:49,340
so they're neither oxidizing,

273
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,280
reducing and it just at the end we
got to water and showed that in water

274
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:57,870
hydrogen is plus one and oxygen
is minus two. So it's neither,

275
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:03,480
right? Although, uh, and in fact
you can see that when it, uh,

276
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:08,481
the reaction of water with ethylene
catalyzed by acid and the carbon is minus

277
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,840
two minus two for ethylene,

278
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,880
after you've added it's
minus one minus three,

279
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,140
right?

280
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,140
So one carbon got oxidized but the other
carbon got reduced and there's no net

281
00:18:24,901 --> 00:18:29,340
change, right? So you don't need
either an oxidizing or reducing agent,

282
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,050
right? Because there is no net change in
the oxidation step. So water can do that.

283
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,030
So,
but water does a work in oxidizing,

284
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:43,920
reducing, uh, scenarios. And in
particular a very important one.

285
00:18:43,921 --> 00:18:48,780
Photosynthesis changes
oxidizes water to o two. Right?

286
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,730
But at the same time,
uh,

287
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,760
reduces the hydrogen and water to the
equivalent of h minus and that's nad takes

288
00:18:56,971 --> 00:19:01,170
up the age to become Nad h and remember
we've talked about that being a source

289
00:19:01,171 --> 00:19:05,430
of hydride h minus, right? So it
gets both oxidized and reduced.

290
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,223
Uh,

291
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:12,410
so not all reducing agents would work
satisfactorily is for any given reaction,

292
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:18,420
but it's typically few tile to try
a reagent from the wrong class.

293
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,680
You don't usually use bromine if
you need to do reduction, right. Or,

294
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,540
or a hydrogen chloride if you needed to
do either oxidation and reduction. Right.

295
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,470
So it can be a big help in narrowing
the field and choosing reagents.

296
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,090
Now I wanted to go to the board a little
bit to show oxidation states this was

297
00:19:39,241 --> 00:19:44,100
done, uh, in the class last year
by Professor Siegel from Zurich,

298
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,360
but I thought it was handy to do and
I will do it again on the board here.

299
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:53,240
Uh, that one and it, this one? Yeah. Okay.

300
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,910
So let me just put this screen up.
Okay.

301
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,130
And don't, I guess for the far
enough, we'll see. I think I can.

302
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,610
And can I blank that video mute.

303
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,723
Okay.

304
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,110
So we, we've, we've talked
about, uh, about arranging a,

305
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,260
uh, uh, let's see there. One other,
so there's one other set center.

306
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,573
There we go.

307
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,281
Okay.
No,

308
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:44,281
he chose to use ch four c h three o h c
h to formic acid and CO2 as examples of

309
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:49,660
oxidation levels carbon.
Let's just do it a little differently.

310
00:20:49,661 --> 00:20:53,920
Not that it's better or worse,
but let's just have an r on there.

311
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:58,720
So we get to have our c h three.
Okay.

312
00:20:58,721 --> 00:21:00,670
What's the oxidation level of the carbon?

313
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,140
Remember how we do with accounting or
bookkeeping if you have another car,

314
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,900
but attached to it they shared that

315
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:15,290
the pair of electrons evenly,
no contribution to oxidize and state.

316
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:20,090
But if it's hydrogen, hydrogen gives its
electron to carbon and making the bond.

317
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:22,280
So this carbon will be plus three

318
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,690
minus three minus three.
Pardon me.

319
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,890
Thanks for being on your toes.

320
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:37,430
Okay.
Then we could have our c,

321
00:21:37,431 --> 00:21:39,590
h two o h.

322
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,403
Okay.

323
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,520
Okay. So the oxygen cancels one of
the carbons. So this'll be minus one.

324
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:51,270
Notice we're going in steps of
two here, right? Is the same,

325
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:52,980
but when I went up there,
but I've,

326
00:21:52,981 --> 00:21:57,330
I've decided to put an r on instead
of one of the H's just for variety.

327
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,860
So now r,

328
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,640
c h double bond o right now it's plus one.

329
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:10,350
Hey, because you have two
oxygens, one hydrogen,

330
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:15,770
then we could go r a,

331
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:20,640
c o, o, h, a carboxylic acid,

332
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,410
now it's plus three.

333
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:25,040
All right.

334
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:30,320
And at the very end you can go to CEO
to then you don't have the are in there

335
00:22:30,321 --> 00:22:34,910
and that's plus four as it
says up there. Okay. Now let's,

336
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:35,870
uh,

337
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:40,870
let's look at different classes of
compounds at their levels of oxidation.

338
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,460
So we could have alkanes.

339
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,300
Yeah,

340
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:53,250
so we could have, uh, uh, let's see,

341
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,110
we've already got a r c h
three. Okay, so minus three.

342
00:22:58,111 --> 00:23:00,630
So we'll check that one.
Okay.

343
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:05,340
Now can we have an alkane which has the,

344
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,430
the oxidation state of carbon minus one.

345
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:15,770
So it'd be a carbon that has
all bonds to carbon, right?

346
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,900
Except one bond,
the hydrogen.

347
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:23,200
So a way to do that
would be to have R, c, h,

348
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,020
double bond, O, c, h, r. So on.

349
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,183
He

350
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:40,610
and then we could go to Al [inaudible],

351
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,980
a r c Si are.

352
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,800
So this would be

353
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,550
El con

354
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,290
and each of these is is minus one.

355
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:00,910
Overall it's minus two.
And each of these is zero.

356
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:02,600
Okay.

357
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,220
Right
now

358
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,650
what this means is

359
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,423
that

360
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,660
that if you wanted to get an alkene,

361
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:18,610
it has the same oxidation
level as the alcohol.

362
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,970
Right.
I got that right.

363
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:27,650
Actually, I should have worked
this through better ahead of time.

364
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:29,703
MMM.

365
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,520
It works.
That one works better in his scheme.

366
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:37,340
But notice that you could re the ALC,
uh,

367
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:40,540
you can get a or another
alkene would be r,

368
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:43,930
c h c h two.

369
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,830
Right.
Uh,

370
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:52,180
so this one you can get from
here just by a reaction.

371
00:24:52,181 --> 00:24:53,014
We know.

372
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,820
What's the reaction that would go from
the Alkane to the alkene from the alcohol.

373
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:02,640
Yeah.
How do you get there?

374
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,690
What do you call that reaction

375
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,620
to start with an Alkane, an
apartment. This, this is art.

376
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:13,860
This will be our pride because
the sea as part of the are here,

377
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,213
right?
Yeah.

378
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,680
So this one involves ill,
it's an elimination reaction.

379
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:23,910
You just treat it with acid,
you don't need an oxidizing
or reducing agent. Right.

380
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,870
And if you do, uh, and so,

381
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:32,020
so the idea is that you can
go down this way with neither,

382
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:42,300
but if you have to go back and
forth this way, you do oxidation.

383
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,510
Yeah.

384
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,950
Or reduction.

385
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,253
Right.

386
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:57,370
So you could have outfield,
hey lines,

387
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,773
right?

388
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:08,440
So here at you at have our x,
right?

389
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:13,810
And this would be the,
the carbon in the rx would be minus one.

390
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,430
Right?
The carbon that's attached to do the acts,

391
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,050
that is the ex ex nurse of it is
minus one. Right. Let me make,

392
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,290
I should make an RCH too.
Sorry.

393
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,333
Okay.

394
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,180
And how do we get,
say the bromide from the alcohol,

395
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,480
what reagent do we use?

396
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,640
Pbr three

397
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:44,013
or that

398
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,120
are the chloride, s o c l two. These
are not oxidizing or reducing agents.

399
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:51,580
Right? The, the elements are in
there. A normal thing. So we can,

400
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:56,620
we can go down without using
an oxidizing or reducing agent.

401
00:26:56,890 --> 00:27:01,480
You wouldn't, uh, now how,
how could we get from here,

402
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:04,150
from an Alkane over to here.

403
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:09,410
How would you put bromine in?
Say what reagent did you use?

404
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,760
Alipay in one way can help you overall

405
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:19,410
what reagent? No, that's,

406
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,313
that's very good.

407
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:25,210
If you have an Alkane,
so ch bonds and you want to make CBR.

408
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,420
Anybody remember a reaction to do that?

409
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,460
What's the problem?
And reacting an alkane.

410
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,920
They're not reacted. Why. Dot.
No high homos. Low Lumos, right?

411
00:27:40,921 --> 00:27:44,700
No functional group. How do you get at
something that's not a functional group?

412
00:27:44,701 --> 00:27:48,960
How do you get up the hydrogens?
You can't use combos at Lumos.

413
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:58,810
How would you change methane
in de Methyl Bromide?

414
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,583
Yeah,

415
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,700
we are two cl two.
What's up?

416
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,200
Free radical chain reaction.
Right?

417
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:11,940
But notice the things you're using
br two cl l two are oxidizing agents,

418
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,950
right? So to go across in this direction
from one column to the next, you use,

419
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,530
you'd need oxidation,
right?

420
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,980
Or You could do another
oxidation and get r c h x two,

421
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,180
right?

422
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:31,890
And that would require from here doing
a second free radical substitution.

423
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,280
But if you came down from
the Aldehyde to get there,

424
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,530
it's the same oxidation level. So you
don't need something like bromine, right.

425
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:45,370
To get from here down to
here. How bout a few, uh, uh,

426
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,360
we could do alcohols too

427
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:54,660
and of course we could not go also to the,
to the tribe bromide,

428
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,410
r c c a x three say,

429
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:05,430
and that we could get
from an acid right?

430
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:08,700
Without using an oxidizing
or reducing agent.

431
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,510
But if we have to get it from anything
over here from an alcohol or from an

432
00:29:12,511 --> 00:29:17,100
Aldehyde, we have to do oxidation
to get that somewhere. Okay.

433
00:29:17,101 --> 00:29:22,101
On the ultimate one is a co two would
be carbon tetrachloride for example.

434
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:28,010
That's the company that's completely
oxidized for them. Or if we have, uh,

435
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:31,200
uh, Alfio hides alcohols
here, we had an alcohol,

436
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,860
right?
Uh,

437
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:42,460
let's suppose we made a
dial r a o h taken twice

438
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,080
and with h in here, r c
h o h taken twice, right?

439
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:54,340
That if we've started from an alcohol
to get that we have to do an oxidation,

440
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,960
choose an oxidizing agent.

441
00:29:56,470 --> 00:30:00,100
But if we could make it
from an Aldehyde without,

442
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,010
without using an oxidizing
and reducing agent.

443
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,570
Can you think of any way of going from
an Aldehyde to a carbon that has two

444
00:30:07,571 --> 00:30:08,470
alcohols on it?

445
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,220
Do you remember what you call a
carbon that has two o h is on it?

446
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,250
Agenda dial.
Where do you get it?

447
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,753
MMM,

448
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,960
we need to do an observation
like rolling or something. No,

449
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:36,590
we immediately see you don't
because they're in the same column.

450
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,100
Same observation level.

451
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,720
So you remember what the
what, how, how do you make

452
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:46,430
the dial for me? Let's, let's uh,

453
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:53,020
r c o h and I want to get r,

454
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:59,270
c. O, h. O. H. H.

455
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,510
What do I do first?
Derek

456
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,380
protonate the oxygen protonate the oxygen
plus charge here.

457
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,870
And then an o h minus comes in
the talks with this. Oh, H minus.

458
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:16,480
So we bad at h plus a h mindless.
It's more likely that in,

459
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:20,600
if you're using acid ketalysis that
there's very little low h minus around.

460
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,150
Right, because the acid
would have reacted with it.

461
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,710
So what would you normally use?

462
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:27,870
Used to come here to make the CEO bond,

463
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,400
see the water and the water right.
And then lose a proton.

464
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,170
So the protons,

465
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,820
just a catalyst. Right? Uh, so, but, but
notice what we're using is just water

466
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:46,040
an h plus thousands or Ooh,
minus ketalysis eat too.

467
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,880
You can have hydroxide ed first and
then this pulls a proton off water.

468
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,253
Okay.
So,

469
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:57,270
so you go up and down using just
water and the acid things that aren't

470
00:31:57,271 --> 00:32:00,870
oxidizing, reducing agents. So you
can see how that might work out,

471
00:32:00,871 --> 00:32:03,030
that if you create in your,

472
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:08,040
on your study sheet a list of
oxidation levels of, of things.

473
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,980
And uh,

474
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:13,810
then you could see it when you're
faced with a given problem, uh,

475
00:32:13,811 --> 00:32:16,590
weather what kind of
reagent you need to choose.

476
00:32:16,591 --> 00:32:20,880
And if you can simplify to a third of the
reagents, you know, that's a big help.

477
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:25,860
Okay. Now, uh, so that's
just the bookkeeping.

478
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:29,160
There's also the question of the
mechanism by which you do this.

479
00:32:29,161 --> 00:32:32,700
So let's just consider br
two as an oxidizing agent.

480
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,910
So if you have an owl cane,
a r,

481
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:40,060
c h three say and you
react it with VR too,

482
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:44,090
to get the an oxidized form,

483
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,670
r c h two B are,

484
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:51,710
what's the mechanism by which you
do it? We just did this, Chris.

485
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,750
It's a free ride. All
right, so we get B R. Dot.

486
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:02,520
Taking the hydrogen and we've,
we've done this before.

487
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,920
You got the radical and then so free
radical chain reactions that bromines

488
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:10,860
oxidizing agent, but acting the
somo. It's different with alcohol's.

489
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,410
Let's suppose we have VR too.

490
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:15,463
Yes.

491
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,300
And we want to react with an alcohol.

492
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,240
How does the reaction begin?

493
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:33,110
I mean it would be possible to do it
by a free radical reaction. Right?

494
00:33:33,111 --> 00:33:36,410
If you had, if you put in an
initiator, get chains going,

495
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:37,490
it would be possible to do it,

496
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:42,050
but there's a better reaction
to react VR too with ethanol.

497
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,640
And how does that begin?

498
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:50,430
Maybe what makes B are too reactive.

499
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,710
Hi Hobo. Lumo what's high?

500
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,493
What's low?

501
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:14,110
Not many orbitals there. Sigma
Star. Okay, so we got signals

502
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,003
star here

503
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,480
and what's high homo then of the alcohol?

504
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,420
Yeah, fiction. Lone pair. On
the, Oh, okay. So long pair on,

505
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,730
yeah.
Let's see how these work.

506
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:28,970
Yeah.

507
00:34:28,970 --> 00:34:32,800
The Pr, pardon me. Um,

508
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,700
attacks the sigma star. That takes
about the VR, right? I want to do this.

509
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:44,420
A red, actually that's no
better read than the other one.

510
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,720
Okay. So this comes in here
and these leave and we've,

511
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:54,770
we've seen things like this forever.
So we have h O,

512
00:34:55,310 --> 00:34:57,430
B r and that,

513
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,080
let me write this with this unshared
pair just for, to be cumbersome about it.

514
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,780
Okay. And Bromide came away
and there's a plus charge here.

515
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,870
How do we get rid of the plus charge?
Maybe you're doing it

516
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:32,060
in age. Yep. Perfect Bro.

517
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,120
So now we got, Oh, br. Oh,

518
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,100
I was gonna make that

519
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:46,280
ch two
ch three.

520
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,760
Okay.
And here we got this

521
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,403
at fair.

522
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,720
And now can you see
anything that this might do?

523
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:11,560
What reactions, if we see we had, when
we have Adam's next to one another,

524
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,350
bromine on one hydrogen on the other

525
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,910
two reactions.
So we have some

526
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:23,960
base, it doesn't have to be a strong
base, it could just be the alcohol,

527
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,753
uh,

528
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:35,570
or it could be the bromide
that we lost here. Okay.

529
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,300
So this can take the h,

530
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:42,230
this goes in and these go on the bromine,
bromine.

531
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,530
So now we have,

532
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,093
yeah,

533
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:55,270
double bond o.
This h is still there,

534
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,520
c h three

535
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,280
and bromide,

536
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,310
which has that pair of electrons.

537
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:10,960
Yeah.

538
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,880
So we've oxidized the alcohol
to the Aldehyde. Right.

539
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,860
We've gone from here to here.

540
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,343
Okay.

541
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,120
And notice what the trick was that the
first oxidations and reductions we talked

542
00:37:27,121 --> 00:37:30,600
about where electron transfer
and actual electron transfer,

543
00:37:30,601 --> 00:37:35,580
like from a metal to a, to a sigma
star bond about how he'll haylight.

544
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:39,300
Right here we're transferring electrons,
but in pairs,

545
00:37:39,301 --> 00:37:41,760
the electron start
belonging to the oxygen.

546
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,240
Then they're shared between
the oxygen and the bromine,

547
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,430
and then they leave with the bromine.

548
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:52,080
So the bromine came in and took a
pee and shared a pair of electrons,

549
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:56,190
then went away carrying them away.
Right?

550
00:37:56,191 --> 00:38:00,300
So it removed this pair of electrons
and that's how the oxidation occurred.

551
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:09,730
Okay. So that's just an, so
the, these reactions are just,

552
00:38:09,731 --> 00:38:11,620
this is an sn two reaction.

553
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,390
Yeah.

554
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,340
And this is an e two reaction.

555
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,050
Yeah.

556
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:22,920
So they're just normal mechanisms, but
because of the way we look at it, it's a,

557
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:27,540
it's a oxidation reduction reaction.
Uh,

558
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,910
okay.
And now cro three,

559
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,380
chromium six.

560
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,840
Let's see what this way

561
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:48,200
that reminds you a little bit of a Ketone,
right?

562
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,440
The CRM.
So you could imagine adding water

563
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,310
to give cr.

564
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,370
Oh, Oh, oh h.

565
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,030
O. H. Okay.

566
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,590
What's the oxidation state if the
chromium is oxidation state here?

567
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,090
What's its oxidation state here?

568
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,690
What's its oxidation state here?
Still

569
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,320
still plus six.
You know,

570
00:39:19,350 --> 00:39:24,090
you could add a photo box to use water
to be the same observation state.

571
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:31,900
All right. Or You could,
uh, you could imagine, uh,

572
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,670
making having two of these.

573
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,980
So these are a little bit like alcohol's
you could imagine to make an ether from

574
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:41,450
that.
So you could have cr,

575
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,620
oh, CR, right?

576
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:49,120
With a o.
O h.

577
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,280
O h.

578
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,420
O.

579
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:00,250
O. O. O. H.

580
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:04,660
So this is a chromium trioxide,
chromic acid,

581
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:09,700
dichromate and so on. So there are lots
of different forms, or you can get,

582
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:12,340
if you reacted it with Hcl,

583
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,723
you could

584
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:20,180
protonate lose, lose water,
add the chlorine instead.

585
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,340
So you could get c, r, O, O, c,

586
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:27,860
l, O, h.

587
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,270
But all of these are just different
disguises of the same thing.

588
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,970
Chromium six.
Okay.

589
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:40,270
Now let's consider the reaction of any
of these with an alcohol like a h o c h,

590
00:40:44,451 --> 00:40:46,820
two ch three,
right?

591
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,500
So we can have the unshared pair
and I'll do it in red again,

592
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,880
right?
Attack the chromium.

593
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:00,833
So we got

594
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,460
h o

595
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:11,540
CR, no bond, no double bond. O,

596
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:13,123
uh

597
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,530
Oh minus or Ooh,
let's do the o h

598
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,333
right?

599
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:27,850
And now notice that we're in the
same business we were with bromine.

600
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,610
We have now, uh, let me,

601
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,550
let me write this out so that it
looks like the one over there.

602
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:39,050
H H.
So now we can bring up some base,

603
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,510
uh,
take this age.

604
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,770
This goes in here and the chromium
leaves with that pair of electrons,

605
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:50,330
right? So again, just as before,
we'll let, we'll have lost the proton.

606
00:41:50,331 --> 00:41:53,930
It looks just like what happened
over there. The chromium came in,

607
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:57,530
shared the pair of electrons
and then left with them.

608
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,970
And the elimination reaction,
right? So again, it's a, it's,

609
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:07,520
it's oxidation oxidation. And if you
look at the chromium chromium afterwards,

610
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:12,500
it's CR. Oh, oh, Oh age,

611
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,580
right? And what's, uh, my right here?

612
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:21,410
A minus.

613
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:25,433
Yeah.

614
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,450
So it's got one, two, three, four, five.

615
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:33,580
It's giving to oxygen, but it gets
an electron back with the minus.

616
00:42:33,581 --> 00:42:34,820
So this is plus four.

617
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:36,800
Yeah.

618
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,090
So chromium goes from plus six plus
four in the process of doing this,

619
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:45,410
this, uh, oxidation. Okay.

620
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,540
Now there's a problem in doing
this to make an Aldehyde.

621
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,750
And the problem is that
if you're, if you're, uh,

622
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:58,990
when you're working in water,
if the pro,

623
00:42:59,030 --> 00:43:01,400
the product you're going to
get here from this elimination,

624
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:04,640
you've lost this proton,
you'll lose this h break this bond.

625
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,390
So you have c double Bondo.

626
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,040
No.
If that's what you want to make,

627
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,000
there's a problem because Aldehydes,
you know,

628
00:43:16,001 --> 00:43:19,420
have an equilibrium constant
about one with water.

629
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,140
So this is going to add
water to make a dial.

630
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:28,280
Yeah.

631
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,630
And why is that a problem?

632
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:33,740
Because alcohol's

633
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,100
react with chromium trioxide to get
oxidized. So you would, you could,

634
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:44,600
you could, uh, uh, uh, lose, lose this,

635
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:48,330
uh,
uh,

636
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,790
so this option and give up.
It's pair of electrons get oxidized.

637
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:54,500
You've lose this age and this age.

638
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:59,240
And then you would have
o h c double bond o

639
00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:03,050
so you over oxidize.

640
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,280
Yeah,

641
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,060
right. All the way to the carboxylic
acid. We go on another step up there.

642
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,900
Now how can you avoid that problem?

643
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:17,883
Let me

644
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,370
ask you this one.
This one.

645
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,980
Okay.
You could do

646
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:35,580
it by making this, the
reagent shown here. Whoops.

647
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,780
Uh,
video

648
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:44,800
pira Denny young chloro chromate so
notice you added Hcl to cro three,

649
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,900
which made chromic chloro chromic acid,

650
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:54,390
and then the proton has given to
parody and to make a Pyridium cad at.

651
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:59,990
Now that is organic enough that it's
readily soluble in organic solvents,

652
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:01,651
right?

653
00:45:01,651 --> 00:45:05,940
Which the other forms of chromium that
we talked about or not now can you see

654
00:45:05,941 --> 00:45:10,941
what advantage that PR that might
provide to do it in an organic

655
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,610
salt
water?

656
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:19,360
So the reagent is called all

657
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,360
period idiom chloro chromate and here's
an example where you get a 92% yield of

658
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:30,850
the Aldehyde from an a straight chain
alcohol use in period end IOM crow,

659
00:45:30,851 --> 00:45:31,890
chloro chromate.

660
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:37,250
The crucial thing is the solvent is
methylene chloride ch two cl two,

661
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,840
right?
No water,

662
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:45,620
no gem dial and therefore
no over oxidation because
the mechanism requires the

663
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,350
alcohol to react with.
Okay,

664
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:55,440
I took that example from Loudon's
textbook. However, if you,

665
00:45:55,650 --> 00:45:59,700
so textbooks often, uh, I
have no doubt that, that,

666
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:03,750
that that happened and that they got
92% yield. But as a general reaction,

667
00:46:03,751 --> 00:46:06,810
there can be a problem. If you look
at what Wikipedia says about this,

668
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,550
there seems to be the voice of
experience writing. It says in practice,

669
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:15,840
the chromium byproduct deposits with
peer Dean is a sticky black tar,

670
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:17,880
which can complicate matters.

671
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:22,930
You've gotten a rose colored
picture in your lab. I mean you're,

672
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,050
you've often had frustrations.
I know,

673
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,820
but those reactions are carefully chosen
so you don't get sticky black stars.

674
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:34,470
But you find very often, and when you
try to do something in organic chemistry,

675
00:46:34,471 --> 00:46:38,550
you get something that's very difficult
to filter or deal with and that that can

676
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:40,470
happen in this reaction.
But anyhow, period,

677
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,700
any employer and chromate is what
you use on an exam when it's asked,

678
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:48,810
how are you going to oxidize and
alcohol to an Aldehyde without getting a

679
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:53,650
carboxylic acid? Now you can have, oh,

680
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:56,730
sorry. We're going to have to carry
on with this next time. Thanks.
