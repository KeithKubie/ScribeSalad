Hey downloaders and downloadettes, Jules here
for DNews!

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.580
If you’re one of the lucky few mobile phone
users who have been grandfathered in on an

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.010
unlimited data plan, your days are numbered.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.439
Companies left and right are dropping unlimited
data or targeting those using more than, say,

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:28.910
200 gigabytes a month.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.140
Now, that certainly sounds like a lot, and
maybe even like some users are abusing their

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.140
unlimited plans.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.690
200 gigs is about 200 hours of Netflix streaming,
or 3 and a third marathon sessions of Game

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.860
of Thrones.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.980
Clearly, these companies are just trying to
recoup their costs.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.980
Or are they?

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.100
Okay, data is sent over the air, by electromagnetic
radio waves, similar waves those used by radio

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.410
and television and WiFi… phone carriers
in particular are limited to a certain spectrum.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.490
Mobile data tends to run in the 800 megahertz
range.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.530
But that range means there is a limited amount
of physical space for all the data to flow

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.530
through.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.740
The reason for this is that each layer of
the wave can only hold a certain amount of

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.740
information.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.140
Basically, a cell phone has a virtual pipeline
from the phone to the nearest cell tower,

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.070
which only has so much space.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.100
You can only send a certain number of bits
per second through your pipe.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.280
In real life, this capacity is determined
through something called “Shannon’s law”,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.900
which calculates the physical limit for the
amount of data that can be transmitted per

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.811
second, while being bombarded with “noise”
of every other electromagnetic force in the

00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:34.811
air.

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:39.500
So, when you upgrade your phone from 3G to
LTE, you’re upgrading the encoding of information

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.390
you can fit into each slice of the spectrum,
and also how much of the spectrum is being

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.890
used at once: basically, you’re getting
a bigger pipe.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.060
That’s why each upgrade makes your wireless
speed faster.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.310
But those who stream hundreds of gigabytes
from one device take up larger amount of over-the-air

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.640
bandwidth that other people could be using
at the same time.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.730
Even though we’ve never come close to this
limit defined by Shannon’s law, our LTE

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.250
pipes are now full.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.080
To deal with this problem, companies need
to install more cell phone towers for our

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.630
data, or develop new technologies to send
data better.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.670
And infrastructure development is incredibly
expensive.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.240
Sprint has plans to spend $15 billion dollars
over three years just to add and upgrade new

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.080
cell towers, while AT&amp;T is spending $3 billion
dollars to bring LTE to Mexico.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.850
So plans to shaft the 200 gig club might not
just be about the money, but about actually

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.310
freeing up some space for the rest of us.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.520
The real cost of getting the data from those
towers to you is much more difficult to figure

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520
out.

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.270
The information is proprietary, and of course,
most of the companies don’t share that information.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.980
When it comes to wired transmission, one independent
service provider in Canada, Radiant Communications,

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.860
said the cost is less than 5 cents per gigabyte.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.240
Netflix claims it’s around 1 cent.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.490
Of course, these are both established companies
with infrastructure already built.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.700
The cost of wired and wireless data depends
on a variety of factors, including how much

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.050
infrastructure they have available and when
you use your data (if you use it at high traffic

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.050
times).

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.240
One thing we do know about is how much texting
costs.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.640
As it turns out, texting is virtually free
from a purely “data transfer” standpoint.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.700
Your phone is constantly in communication
with cell towers, it is ALWAYS sending information

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.340
to let the tower know you’re still there,
which is how cell phone tracking is possible.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.490
But when you send a text, it simply piggybacks
off the existing communication, and in particular,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:43.540
occupies, what is referred to as “unused
space”.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.370
It’s like going on a road trip and filling
an extra seat with a passenger.

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.330
Although it is nice to have them pitch in
for the cost of the trip, the cost overall

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.040
would be roughly the same with or without
them.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.380
And, in this analogy, instead of chipping
in for a tank of gas, the passenger is actually

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.100
paying for a tanker-truck full of gas.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.860
Texting costs have been estimated to be up
to 7,314 percent higher than what companies

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.550
would charge for the equivalent amount of
data, which is only about 1/1000th of a penny.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:15.000
And while modern unlimited texting plans don’t
generally comprise such insane overages, texts

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.160
still cost more than 1/1000th of a cent for
the end user… for communication the cell

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.180
company was already doing anyway.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:27.160
Whoever thought of that “charging for texts”
thing definitely got a corner office.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.560
And a parking spot.

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.719
But what if you want to get in touch with
astronauts in space?

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:33.020
Do you send them a text?

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.499
Or maybe… you can use a radio invented in
the 1890s.

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:39.830

plan?
