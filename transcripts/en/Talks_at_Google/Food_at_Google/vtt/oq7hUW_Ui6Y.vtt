00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.260
MALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.560
Thank you guys for joining
us for another guest chefs

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.840
at Google LAX.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.979
We're very excited to
have chef Dakota Weiss.

00:00:16.979 --> 00:00:19.020
And this is also going to
be our first guest chef

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.450
event here at Google LAX.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.950
It's branded under to the Gap.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:23.990
So thanks for being
a part of this.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.020
Today Dakota of Top Chef fame
and 9:30 in The Backyard,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.530
as well as the W Hotel,
but specifically 9:30

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.330
in The Backyard
from Westwood, is

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.580
going to do a low calorie, low
fat, three course meal for you

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.920
guys that you can pull
off in 20 minutes.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.470
DAKOTA WEISS: Well, possibly.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.970
MALE SPEAKER: We're going to
give you all the time you like.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.830
She's going to give you
the basic steps right here.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.488
I just didn't want to
put any pressure on you.

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:49.982
DAKOTA WEISS:
Seriously, oh my god.

00:00:49.982 --> 00:00:50.980
MALE SPEAKER: Cool.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.980
DAKOTA WEISS: Cool guys.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.050
Thank you for
coming, and ladies.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.540
So I prepared this
low calorie, which

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.610
is very not so much my nature.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.040
I'm really into the butter,
and the cream, and the cheese.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.130
However, we're in California,
we're next to the beach.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.260
It's Google, I know everybody's
very conscious these days

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.750
about what they're eating,
organic, and fresh,

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.970
and light, and stuff.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.970
So I created this for
you all, just for you.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.880
We're going to start with a raw
vegan dish which actually, this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.080
is squash carpaccio version 3.1.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.130
I've taken this dish
and kind of changed it

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.440
throughout the seasons just
update it a little bit.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.660
But it is something that
we do serve at 9:30,

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.290
but that's version 3.0.

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.590
So don't get those confused.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.820
So basically we'll
get started here.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.450
We're going to take
a cousa squash.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.060
Does anybody know what
a cousa squash is?

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.000
It's also known as the
Mexican Gray Squash.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.640
It's obviously kind of a
cross between a yellow squash

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.810
and a zucchini.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.270
But this particular
squash, and the reason I

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.520
use this one is because
it has less seeds.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.470
And the meat inside of it has
got almost a creamy texture

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.950
to it.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.180
So we're just going to slice
the top off, shave it very thin.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.680
Watch your fingers.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.515
If you don't have a man--
does anybody cook at home?

00:02:16.515 --> 00:02:17.460
All right.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.760
Does everybody have
a mandolin at home?

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.200
It is one of the
most fabulous tools,

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.700
I highly recommend you have.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.260
It slices just about anything,
including your fingers.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.950
So please be careful.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.970
So we're just going to kind
of line this down the plate.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.100
This really is technically
like a five minute dish,

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.555
if even that.

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:41.520
And it's really
delicious and fresh.

00:02:48.854 --> 00:02:50.770
Well, you know in
California everything's kind

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.400
of in season year round.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040
But it's primarily summer.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.040
We're going that thin.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.010
You can't quite read
a newspaper through it

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.810
but it's still
pretty paper thin.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.360
So we're going to add on to
this a yuzu soy white truffle

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.390
vinaigrette.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.620
The most awesome thing
about this vinaigrette

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.380
is you don't need any equipment.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.420
You just need a cup and a lid.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.970
And so I call it my
shaker vinaigrette.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.325
So we're going to start with
a little yuzu juice, which

00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:25.950
I'm pretty sure you can probably
get at Whole Foods these days.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.735
If not, there's plenty
of Asian markets

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:28.860
around that you can get it.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.170
This is a little white soy
sauce, rice vinegar, and then

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.760
our white truffle oil.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.650
And you don't need to add any
salt to this because the soy

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.086
sauce adds enough of that.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.085
That's it.

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:50.755
How easy that was.

00:03:50.755 --> 00:03:54.290
And we're going to
season our squash here.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.180
I use a little bit
of Maldon salt, which

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360
is a salt that
comes from England.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.430
And it's these really
beautiful crystals.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.850
When you come up you
can kind of see them.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.650
We're going to add a little
shaved Serrano pepper to this

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.800
to give it a little spice.

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.720
Kind of sprinkle it around
kind of like a Pollock design,

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.896
I'd like to say.

00:04:27.504 --> 00:04:30.170
And then we're going to add some
fresh sliced heirloom tomatoes.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.852
This dish is already
screaming summer, right?

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:39.060
Don't you want to get in
your bikini and bathing suit

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.580
right now?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.696
And I toasted earlier some
fresh sunflower seeds just

00:04:46.696 --> 00:04:48.320
to give it a little
crunch and texture.

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.710
And then the dressing you
can be very liberal with it

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.520
because it doesn't
have a lot of oil.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.250
And it's really
packed with flavor,

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.970
and you want to make sure that
the squash gets completely

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:04.620
doused in it.

00:05:16.106 --> 00:05:17.480
And then lastly,
we're just going

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.410
to add some aromatic
herbs to it.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.922
And it can be whatever you like.

00:05:21.922 --> 00:05:23.880
If you've got something
growing in your garden,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.170
I highly recommend those.

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:32.520
But we're going to add
a little bit of basil,

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.920
and then a little bit
of micro bulls blood.

00:05:43.452 --> 00:05:45.760
All right, and that
is your first course.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.460
Anybody want to try it?

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.127
Yeah, all right.

00:05:49.127 --> 00:05:50.293
I'm going to come over here.

00:05:50.293 --> 00:05:52.000
And you guys can
just kind of come up.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.035
Bring you some forks.

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:11.370
You just pick them
right off there.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.465
Yeah, go for it.

00:06:13.465 --> 00:06:15.215
You'll see it's very
light and refreshing.

00:06:53.436 --> 00:06:54.185
What do you think?

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:28.260
You guys like it?

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.447
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:07:29.447 --> 00:07:31.530
DAKOTA WEISS: It's surprising,
well in my opinion,

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:33.654
it's always surprising that
something raw and vegan

00:07:33.654 --> 00:07:36.190
tastes so good just because
I'm not a vegetarian.

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:40.360
But by golly, it sure can.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.070
And you saw how
easy it is to do.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.310
You just need a mandolin.

00:07:43.310 --> 00:07:44.976
And you can do it
with a knife if you've

00:07:44.976 --> 00:07:47.250
got mad skills at
home with a knife.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:48.536
Go for it, but yeah.

00:07:48.536 --> 00:07:49.910
It's so simple to
make good food.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.190
All right.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.030
So our second
course, we're going

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.617
to make a slow
roasted arctic char.

00:08:00.617 --> 00:08:02.200
Does anybody know
what arctic char is?

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.120
AUDIENCE: Fish.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.340
DAKOTA WEISS: Yeah.

00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.510
It's very similar
to salmon and trout.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:12.640
I like to call it the sea trout.

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.490
And we're going to serve
it with a lemon shitaki

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:20.035
broth and some roasted
spring vegetables.

00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:26.840
That's where you guys go Oooh.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.110
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.705
DAKOTA WEISS: Ahh, right.

00:08:30.705 --> 00:08:31.330
I'll queue you.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.340
Next time it'll be this.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.720
OK, so we're going to
start with our broth.

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:39.429
So this starts to get
steeping in with the shitakis

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:41.615
and the lemon-- very simple.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.820
Some dried shitakis.

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.890
You can get these at
any of the Asian markets

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:54.080
off Sawtell or the
big one off Pico.

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.210
Can never the name of that one.

00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:57.850
And then I like
to take the lemons

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.810
and zest them right
into the shitakis.

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:04.708
When you zest any
citrus, I don't

00:09:04.708 --> 00:09:07.160
know if I can get this on
camera, but it's pretty cool.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.970
It kind of explodes
with essential oils.

00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:17.500
And when you twist it, kind of
have to be really close to it,

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.870
you can see the oils
kind of shoot off.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:21.670
And even more, so
you can smell it.

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:23.600
So what I'm trying
to do with this broth

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.970
is captured those
oils into the broth.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.900
That's why I don't zest
them ahead of time.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.310
No, if it's not going
to-- the shitakis

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.830
are so powerful that
you're not going

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:41.640
to get any sort of
bitterness from it.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.990
And then you can make this with
water if you're a pescaterian.

00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:48.470
That's fine, but I chose to
make it with a chicken stock

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.886
to give just a
little more flavor.

00:09:58.499 --> 00:10:00.040
And then basically,
you're just going

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.540
to kind of let this steep
for about 20 minutes.

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:04.410
Once it's ready
and it comes off,

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:11.720
it's going to be a
beautiful, dark brown color.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.960
Can you guys see that?

00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:19.690
It's got a really nice, golden
brown, mushroom-ey flavor to it

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:22.740
as well, which you'll see.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.196
See, I'd let it steep
like this 20 minutes.

00:10:25.196 --> 00:10:26.820
And then you can
strain everything off.

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.830
If you want to season it with
a little bit of soy sauce,

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:30.500
to add a little salt
to it, that's fine.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.130
If you want to go low sodium
just leave it as it is.

00:10:33.130 --> 00:10:35.290
Because all the other
vegetables and the fish

00:10:35.290 --> 00:10:37.010
have a lot of flavor
on them as well.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:42.450
I try to not use too
much, because I really

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:44.160
want to intensify
and get the most

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:46.980
flavor I can out of
all the ingredients.

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:49.570
Dried shitakis can
be a little expensive

00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:51.090
but they do pack a punch.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.730
So a little does go a long way.

00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:57.390
And then when you do strain it
off, really kind of press it.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:00.650
Try to get all the liquid and
everything out of the shitakis

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:02.510
once we're over.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:04.820
So that's going to go.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.600
While this is on
your stove boiling,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.030
you can get your fish ready.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.905
So arctic char,
like I said, it's

00:11:17.905 --> 00:11:20.710
this really gorgeous
pink fleshed

00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:22.525
fish, very similar to salmon.

00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:24.400
Sort of what I like to
call it the sea trout.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.000
And it's got this
really gorgeous skin

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.244
with these little, beautiful
pink polka dots on it.

00:11:29.244 --> 00:11:31.160
I don't know about you,
but I love polka dots,

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.230
so that makes me love
this fish even more.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:41.330
Really simple to season with
salt and pepper, both the skin

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:42.210
and the flesh.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.330
Let your pan get pretty warm.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:54.210
Just put a little bit
of olive oil in it,

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:56.810
and then you're going to
start it skin side down.

00:11:56.810 --> 00:11:58.340
My little tester
is usually to grab

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.080
just a little bit of liquid.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.830
Flick it in there.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.180
If you hear that,
you're good to go.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.915
Stand back, you want
to burn your face.

00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:31.020
So once you have
this in your pan

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:32.990
you're going to let the
skin get super crispy.

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.740
It's going to take about
two to three minutes.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.630
At that point, you're going
to keep it on the skin

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.390
and you can pop it in
the oven at about 325

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:44.045
and just slowly roast it.

00:12:47.406 --> 00:12:49.030
Is everybody familiar
with cooking fish

00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:50.500
and how it should feel, look?

00:12:53.718 --> 00:12:55.122
What?

00:12:55.122 --> 00:12:56.590
Why not?

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.710
What I like to tell people, the
easiest way, or how I learned

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:02.160
is when you see that albumin
start to come out of it,

00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:05.960
and that's like
the little, white,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.916
it looks like cheese
curds kind of.

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:10.040
That's when you know your
fish is starting to cook.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.270
Arctic char is one of
those great fish where

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.080
you don't need to
cook at all the way.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.159
I like to serve it medium.

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:19.200
But I do know people that
like it completely well

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:21.490
done as well, such as my mother.

00:13:24.005 --> 00:13:25.660
All right, well hot now.

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.070
So you can see once
it starts to smoke,

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:32.230
you know your skin's going
to get crispy like that.

00:13:32.230 --> 00:13:34.156
See on the bot-- well,
that's a little burnt.

00:13:34.156 --> 00:13:35.780
We'll look at this
a little bit better.

00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.490
Nice, crispy, golden brown skin.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.270
Nevermind that one.

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.290
That's why we always
bring two pieces.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.370
So you're going to
take this unburnt one

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:52.330
and pop it in the oven for
about 230 degrees, sorry, 330.

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:52.872
Let it roast.

00:13:52.872 --> 00:13:55.205
When you start to see the
little white albumin come out,

00:13:55.205 --> 00:13:57.340
then you know you're right
about where you want it.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.990
You don't need to
cook it all the way,

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:02.610
because we're going to add
it into our warm broth.

00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:04.660
And as it sits in
that broth, it's

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:08.770
going to continue to carry
over cooking as well.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.470
For this, I think
the vegetables,

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.570
I used in baby carrots,
beats, and turnips.

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:20.190
But I suggest the best thing
because these are really

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:22.180
beautiful right now and
at the farmer's market.

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.917
But the best thing to
do is honestly just

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:25.000
go to the farmer's market.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.810
See what vegetables they have.

00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:30.120
It's better to cook
seasonally, as we all know,

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.775
and to buy your stuff
from the market.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.430
So what I did with these
is I took the carrots,

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:40.430
peeled them lightly, and
just quickly blanched them.

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:42.220
The baby turnips, same thing.

00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.090
See the cute little guys here.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.330
And then just quartered them.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:46.880
And then the beets
are the only thing

00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:51.100
that I roasted in the skin,
olive oil, salt, pepper,

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.120
oven at 350 for
roughly-- if it's

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.570
about that size,
roughly 25 minutes.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:14:59.190
Same thing with the
fish, is you don't

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:01.815
want to cook the vegetables all
the way through, because you're

00:15:01.815 --> 00:15:03.207
going to put them
in a hot broth.

00:15:03.207 --> 00:15:05.290
And that's going to continue
to cook them as well.

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:10.230
Plus we all know you're going
to retain work nutrition and all

00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:13.610
the vitamins from al dente
vegetables as opposed

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:17.560
to mushy vegetables.

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.943
Right.

00:15:19.943 --> 00:15:22.970
Let this heat up a little.

00:15:22.970 --> 00:15:24.080
Any questions so far?

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.539
Because we have a
little lull here.

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:27.496
We're going to wait for
our vegetables to heat.

00:15:27.496 --> 00:15:28.020
So hit me.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.660
What's that?

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:35.520
What about it?

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:42.680
Well the cool thing about
dried mushrooms in particular,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.290
it's very similar to
canned vegetables, tomatoes

00:15:46.290 --> 00:15:47.950
in particular.

00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:49.940
When they pick the
mushrooms to dry them,

00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:53.245
they're at their best ripeness.

00:15:53.245 --> 00:15:55.620
They're like prime condition.

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.670
They take them, and
they dehydrate them.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.860
So when you rehydrate
them, they're

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:01.460
just perfect, more or less.

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:02.980
Same thing with canned tomatoes.

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.150
Everybody's like oh,
canned food is awful.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.840
But tomatoes are
really the only one

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.670
that I would ever use
this example with.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:11.420
But they pick them when
they're just perfectly ripe.

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:13.910
That's when they can them,
and they're perfectly ripe

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:16.181
no matter whatever
you do with them.

00:16:16.181 --> 00:16:17.555
You go to the
store, you're going

00:16:17.555 --> 00:16:20.590
to get a mealy tomato no
matter what almost always.

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:23.745
Because it's not necessarily
the season for them.

00:16:23.745 --> 00:16:24.675
Does that make sense?

00:16:27.470 --> 00:16:28.310
What else you got?

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.840
Come on, give me something.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.340
Yeah?

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.970
Everybody knows the Santa
Monica Farmer Market's probably

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:40.421
the biggest and the best I would
say in LA as far as diversity

00:16:40.421 --> 00:16:42.920
and all in all, the different
purveyors and everything where

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.670
you can get soap, oil,
beeswax, dates, and olives,

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:53.100
also to your proteins,
cheese, and vegetables.

00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.140
A couple others
that I really like,

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.870
the Brentwood market is fun.

00:16:58.870 --> 00:17:01.000
And plus, it's right
next to my hotel,

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.596
so it's easy to get there.

00:17:03.596 --> 00:17:05.720
Downtown's got some pretty
cool ones coming up too,

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.819
especially on Sundays
I believe there's

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:14.430
one on Fourth and Spring, Fifth
and Spring, I take that back.

00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:17.680
That's kind of a cool
farmer's market as well.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:20.670
All time favorite farmer's
market in California

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.559
is San Luis Obispo.

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:24.167
Is anybody familiar
with that one?

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.250
It's probably the coolest.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.210
It's every Thursday night,
and they shut down probably

00:17:29.210 --> 00:17:31.800
three blocks of one street.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.990
And each block has its own
band, all the restaurants

00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:39.020
come out, there are restaurants
set up, these cool barbecues.

00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:40.510
It's just super festive.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.285
They've got food,
they've got dancing,

00:17:42.285 --> 00:17:45.660
they've got gymnastics,
and comedians.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.910
It's pretty cool, I
highly recommend it.

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:51.540
Plus SLO is just a really
awesome town as well.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:52.840
Let's see how we're doing here.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.150
So these veggies you
can prep ahead of time.

00:18:04.942 --> 00:18:05.810
Let's see, sorry.

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:10.672
Very interesting, trying
to get it to get hotter.

00:18:10.672 --> 00:18:12.800
Get hot.

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.879
I wish I had my inspector
gadget tools with me

00:18:14.879 --> 00:18:15.920
today, and just did that.

00:18:19.210 --> 00:18:20.165
All right.

00:18:20.165 --> 00:18:23.255
These are going to take a
little long, or a little longer.

00:18:23.255 --> 00:18:25.640
Come on, give me
some more questions.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:28.130
Anybody, come on.

00:18:28.130 --> 00:18:28.780
The popcorn?

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:30.030
Oh, that's a great question.

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:32.050
I can answer that.

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:37.780
Very simply, I take the popcorn,
and I air pop everything.

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:40.260
After that's done,
I make a toffee.

00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.090
So none of it is vegan, although
I'm working on a vegan one

00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:46.620
right now as I was shamed
at the artisinal market

00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:47.653
for not having one.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.400
So it's in the process.

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.670
But make a toffee base.

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:55.100
Whatever the flavor is,
like the Napa, nirvana,

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:57.070
I'll take two
gallons of red wine

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:59.530
and reduce it down to two cups.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:00.575
Add that to the toffee.

00:19:00.575 --> 00:19:04.522
Then you take the popcorn, and
you mix it all up together.

00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:06.480
Then depending on what
goes in it, whether it's

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.415
rosemary or brie,
that particular one I

00:19:08.415 --> 00:19:10.440
take brie pieces and
kind of spread it

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:11.520
throughout sheet tray.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:14.090
And then they bake in
oven for about an hour.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.690
Once they come out,
toss them with the rest

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:22.400
of the ingredients, rosemary,
crackers, whatever it may be.

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:23.400
And that's it.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.380
Well we've had a test jar
for about a year and a half

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.460
just to kind of see
how it would hold.

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:35.260
And we opened it up
about two months ago,

00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.326
and it was still
pretty good and crispy.

00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:38.080
Yeah.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.010
I don't suggest
holding it that long.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:43.820
You put it in your
emergency basement kit.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:53.985
To get, what was the last part?

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.750
Well any balsamic
I like, obviously

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:02.250
I love the aged
balsalmics, but I'm really

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:06.430
having this love affair right
now with golden balsalmics.

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:10.030
It's really sweet but it's
got a nice acidity to it.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:14.014
And you can pretty much, Base
Cities has a great selection.

00:20:14.014 --> 00:20:16.180
And they've got a couple
different golden balsalmics

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:16.679
there.

00:20:16.679 --> 00:20:20.550
But any aged balsalmic in
barrel's the way to go.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:26.850
Raw food recipes, I
wouldn't really know where.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:28.420
I mean obviously
you can Google it.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.620
I'm sure there are a
hundred places, that's

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.290
just like everyday language,
everybody knows that, right?

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.220
And I'm sure 100 different
websites would open up

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:36.890
for that.

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:38.650
However, you've
inspired me, and I

00:20:38.650 --> 00:20:41.910
will put some raw
vegetable or dishes

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:45.930
in general up on my website
at chefdakota.com just for you

00:20:45.930 --> 00:20:47.320
in a week.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.540
Check back, it'll be there.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.880
What's that?

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.100
Yeah, you have to be
really inventive and really

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:04.680
creative to make raw food in
my opinion, taste really good.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.680
If you have a great
product it's going

00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:07.980
to taste great no matter what.

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.440
But to make it
interesting and just step

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.330
outside of the normal kind
of chopped salad, raw thing,

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.390
then it takes a little
bit of creativity.

00:21:30.470 --> 00:21:35.910
There is a restaurant, I
think it's called Salt Air,

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:40.880
and they make a really good
cashew nut cheese there.

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:44.200
Probably, I would assume it's
probably the same thought

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.200
process.

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.840
Yeah.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.520
All right, we are almost
ready to plate here.

00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:50.960
So all the time
has gone through.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.080
Our fish is beautifully
cooked, right?

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.060
Our sauce has stepped,
and it tastes delicious.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:04.050
Our vegetables are roasted,
and we're going to plate.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:04.900
It's very exciting.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.910
Everybody knows
the state law now

00:22:10.910 --> 00:22:13.440
is to wear gloves
pretty much for anything

00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.240
you do in the kitchen these
days, even bartenders.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.910
So if you don't see your
bartender wearing their gloves,

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:19.840
you shame them.

00:22:24.438 --> 00:22:25.900
I'm a glove person.

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:28.410
I prefer them just because I
go home, and I had two dogs.

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:31.550
And if I felt like
food I'll get mauled.

00:22:31.550 --> 00:22:35.560
But I do know a lot of chefs,
sushi chefs in particular

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:37.940
are very upset about
it because it does,

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:42.160
it's not going to leave
a very strong flavor.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.870
But when you're talking about
raw fish that's very oily

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:49.620
and it sucks up flavor it
can alter it a little bit.

00:22:52.426 --> 00:22:54.050
But for the overall
health of everybody

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.486
it's probably just
better and safe.

00:22:56.486 --> 00:22:58.610
All right, so we're going
to season our vegetables.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:09.650
So this is going to be
our little sample bowl.

00:23:09.650 --> 00:23:11.170
So we've got our gorgeous broth.

00:23:17.031 --> 00:23:21.958
And you're going to
ladle that into the bowl.

00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:25.840
It's not necessarily a soup, so
you don't want to do too much.

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.560
But once the fish goes in
there and the vegetables,

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.430
it's really going to soak
up a lot of that liquid.

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.970
And to make it even
more delicious.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.945
We have our beautiful
cooked fish.

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.470
You can be your own artist and
put your vegetables however

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:47.020
you like.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.262
If you're OCD, you can line up
all the carrots, all the beets.

00:23:51.262 --> 00:23:52.720
And then we're
going to finish this

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.820
with a little bit
of pea tendrill

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.814
because it's what's in season.

00:23:57.814 --> 00:23:59.480
You can just toss it
with a little olive

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.340
oil, a little salt.

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.145
Twirl it around.

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:10.965
Right on top there.

00:24:13.692 --> 00:24:15.400
You probably can't
see in there too good.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.020
But when you come up try
your sample you will.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:19.520
All right.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.620
Give me just one minute.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:21.875
You guys ready to try this?

00:24:21.875 --> 00:24:22.500
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:25.160
DAKOTA WEISS: Awesome.

00:24:25.160 --> 00:24:28.560
Pea tendrills are
the leaves of peas.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.930
Yeah.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:36.374
And they're a little more
verdant, a little more grassy.

00:24:36.374 --> 00:24:38.040
But they're just is
cute as they can be,

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.681
because they've got these
little spiral vines on them that

00:24:42.681 --> 00:24:43.430
are just adorable.

00:24:47.667 --> 00:24:49.750
And you'll see them all
over the market right now.

00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:57.790
Anybody have any
other questions?

00:25:02.330 --> 00:25:05.510
For what?

00:25:05.510 --> 00:25:07.680
Harry's Berries.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:11.650
Its all time best berries
I've ever had really,

00:25:11.650 --> 00:25:13.960
and they're at the farmer's
market here in Santa Monica

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.370
every Wednesday and Saturday.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:23.100
I've never seen them in a store.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.100
So I'm not sure, I would
say probably yes for now.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.710
But surely they've got
to be somewhere else.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:34.100
But their farms are
not far from here.

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.710
They're Oxnard and Gaviota.

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:38.920
So I imagine they're in
stores probably more locally

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.940
to where their farms are.

00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:45.180
Have you guys had
Harry's Berries?

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:48.105
It is like just
eating a strawberry.

00:25:48.105 --> 00:25:51.360
You know that really intense,
fake strawberry flavor

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:53.580
you get out of candy sometimes?

00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.060
It tastes just like that.

00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:57.547
And it's so succulent,
and gorgeous, and sweet,

00:25:57.547 --> 00:25:58.130
and delicious.

00:26:01.270 --> 00:26:03.910
What's that?

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.170
Yeah, you'll be like this
is not a Harry's Berry,

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:07.000
I'm not eating it.

00:26:23.401 --> 00:26:25.519
Does everybody eat fish in here?

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:27.560
All right, because I could
make a vegetarian one.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:31.380
Oh, you know what?

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:32.710
I can make you some vegetables.

00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.430
I forgot I put chicken
stock in the broth.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:38.830
I'd hate to tell you it's
vegetarian, then it's not.

00:26:38.830 --> 00:26:40.260
My brief moment
of forgetfulness.

00:27:26.539 --> 00:27:29.400
All right, I'm just going to
get a couple ready for you guys,

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.096
and you can start coming up.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:46.080
They're a little cumbersome
to eat in these little cups,

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.314
but get the point.

00:28:10.191 --> 00:28:12.977
Does everybody have to go
back to work after this?

00:28:12.977 --> 00:28:15.959
Yeah.

00:28:15.959 --> 00:28:19.192
It's a nice break, right?

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.730
All right, you can start
coming up here if you like

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:28.170
and grab the ones with green.

00:28:28.170 --> 00:28:29.330
And then fork right there.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:48.730
And I'd say the
liquid you could,

00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:51.310
once you eat the
fish and the carrots,

00:28:51.310 --> 00:28:55.020
kind of do a little shot of it.

00:28:55.020 --> 00:29:00.415
Well, I think everybody's go to
is probably a seitan or a tofu.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:06.130
Like mushrooms are always
great although there's

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:07.630
no protein in there,
but to give you

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.330
that kind of steak-ey texture.

00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:12.430
Those are always a go to as
well, especially portobellos.

00:29:12.430 --> 00:29:13.710
Porcinis are great.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:17.870
OK.

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:23.680
So for dessert in our very
healthy, light, low calorie

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.720
meal, we're going to make a
homemade almond milk yogurt.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.800
Has anybody made yogurt before?

00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:32.580
Very fun.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.210
Any time I get the
chance to ferment

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:38.330
anything I get super excited.

00:29:38.330 --> 00:29:40.890
And actually I was a little
intimidated at first to make

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:43.010
yogurt.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.440
But just because it's
kind of scary process,

00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.490
leaving stuff out and
hoping it magically

00:29:48.490 --> 00:29:52.540
comes from milk to
this beautiful cream.

00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:55.900
But if I can make it, I've got
to say anybody can make it.

00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.132
Because I'm not much of a baker.

00:29:58.132 --> 00:30:00.090
Not that you have to be
a baker to make yogurt,

00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:04.490
but you have to be very precise
in your measurements and stuff.

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:04.990
OK.

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:08.000
So the first step to this
is to make your almond milk.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.484
You're totally welcome
to just buy almond milk.

00:30:10.484 --> 00:30:11.900
And there's some
great places that

00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:15.000
actually make it artisinally
here in Los Angeles as well.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.470
But it's so simple
to make, and I

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:18.380
feel like if you're going to
go through the hassle of making

00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:20.880
your own yogurt, you might as
well just make the almond milk

00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.820
from scratch.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.400
It is just that easy.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.550
The ratio for almond milk
is usually three to one.

00:30:29.550 --> 00:30:33.300
One being the almonds,
and three being the water.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:37.400
For a yogurt though, I take
it actually down to two to one

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.300
just so you're going to get
a more intense almond flavor.

00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:44.170
And it'll help make the yogurt
a little bit thicker as well.

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:48.440
It helps if you have a really
awesome blender as well.

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:54.570
If you don't, you can buy,
they're called a nut milk bag.

00:30:54.570 --> 00:30:57.630
And it's kind of basically
this really cool sieve.

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:01.120
And once you puree this you
would pour it into this bag

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:03.777
and you literally just
squeeze out all the liquid

00:31:03.777 --> 00:31:04.360
from the milk.

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:05.740
And it keeps all the pulp.

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.786
If you have a badass
blender like this,

00:31:08.786 --> 00:31:10.410
then I say just leave
the pulp in there

00:31:10.410 --> 00:31:12.440
because it's going
to puree it enough

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.720
where it doesn't leave any
weird, fibery textures.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.095
And plus, it's going to add
a little more flavor as well.

00:31:19.980 --> 00:31:21.200
No, the almonds can be whole.

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.610
I just happen to have slivered.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.229
You can toast them if you
want to toastier flavor to it,

00:31:26.229 --> 00:31:27.520
or you can just leave them raw.

00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.880
It's completely up
to you and how much

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.129
you would like your almond
milk to taste like almonds.

00:31:33.650 --> 00:31:36.860
I've not, but I imagine
you can probably

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.235
make a milk out of any nut
as far as I'm concerned.

00:32:02.570 --> 00:32:03.526
OK.

00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:04.960
See how easy that was?

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:06.760
You have almond milk.

00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.482
Awesome.

00:32:07.482 --> 00:32:08.690
So you're going to take that.

00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:10.260
You're going to strain
it or you're just

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.385
going to leave it as it is.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.990
You're going to take
this almond milk.

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.620
There's two ways
you can make yogurt.

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:27.265
You can buy a culture
starter, which

00:32:27.265 --> 00:32:29.475
is kind of like a
powdery substance.

00:32:29.475 --> 00:32:30.850
If you want to
keep it completely

00:32:30.850 --> 00:32:33.050
vegan then go with
the powdery substance.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.410
If you don't care
it's vegan or not,

00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:37.910
you can take any yogurt,
your favorite yogurt

00:32:37.910 --> 00:32:42.860
as long as it has active
cultures inside of it,

00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.170
and you just simply
add it to your milk.

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:55.510
I use clover yogurt.

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:58.170
It's local to California,
and they're just

00:32:58.170 --> 00:32:59.280
a really good farm.

00:33:06.965 --> 00:33:10.450
You just want to lightly
kind of stir it in there

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.690
because you don't want to upset
any of those cultures that

00:33:13.690 --> 00:33:16.220
are in there, because
they're very sensitive.

00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:19.490
Not unlike me sometimes.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:20.800
Just give it a little stir.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:26.670
You're going to cover it up.

00:33:26.670 --> 00:33:29.800
You're going to find a place
somewhere in your house

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.170
or wherever you choose to make
this that's around 90 degrees.

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:36.640
If you don't have a
place that's that hot,

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:41.790
my little MacGyver rig is
if you have a heating pad,

00:33:41.790 --> 00:33:43.900
or you can go to Target
and buy a heating pad,

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:44.820
take that heating pad.

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.220
Put it in a corner
in your kitchen.

00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.880
Wrap this with just a
light towel around it,

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:52.390
and let it sit there
for eight hours.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.692
Forget about it.

00:33:53.692 --> 00:33:55.400
Don't even look at
it, it's like watching

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:58.710
a boiling pot of water, right?

00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:00.750
After eight hours you're
going to refrigerate it

00:34:00.750 --> 00:34:05.080
for about four hours without
opening it or messing with it.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.660
After four hours
you're going to get

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.142
this beautiful
looking substance.

00:34:09.142 --> 00:34:10.929
Right?

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:13.469
Don't be scared.

00:34:13.469 --> 00:34:15.400
What you're going
to do with this part

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.330
is basically cheese cloth
into another container.

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:21.870
If you have really cool Mason
jars like I have the popcorn,

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.420
they make really
awesome little jars,

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:25.900
and they're cute to put them in.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:27.820
And it's kind of hard to see.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:30.409
But you can kind of see
the floating fermented part

00:34:30.409 --> 00:34:31.820
where it's all coagulated.

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.139
Awesome.

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:38.110
And if you smell it, it smells
amazing, just like yogurt.

00:34:38.110 --> 00:34:41.540
And this is going to separate
the liquid from the curds.

00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:53.840
These are more, yeah.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.330
This is big kitchen batch,
this little home batch.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.420
Unless you like a lot of
yogurt, then by all means

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:02.730
go get a big kitchen batch.

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:05.110
So once this completely
strains you're

00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:06.705
going get this
cool looking stuff.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.000
And this is your yogurt.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.599
It's gorgeous, it's going
to look a little curdled.

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:16.515
Don't be alarmed by that,
it's totally normal.

00:35:24.490 --> 00:35:27.240
But it gets this
really amazing texture.

00:35:36.290 --> 00:35:38.950
You can kind of see,
it's pretty thick.

00:35:38.950 --> 00:35:41.490
The more you let it sit, the
thicker it's going to get.

00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.410
And at this point it's
completely ready to go.

00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:49.690
There's no sweetener in this.

00:35:49.690 --> 00:35:52.630
Even though almond milk tends to
be a little sweet, once it goes

00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:56.020
through the fermentation process
it adds that sourness to it.

00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:58.410
So if you like,
you can add sugar,

00:35:58.410 --> 00:36:03.330
or raisins, honey, maple syrup,
whatever it is that you like.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.893
So for our purposes, we're
turning this into a dessert.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:20.700
And we're just going to
take this beautiful yogurt

00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:22.595
and layer it with some berries.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.015
These are not Harry's
Berries for today.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:35.430
If the market was open, I may
have been productive enough

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.170
to go get some.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.225
But not today.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:51.450
Then for this, I wanted to add
a little bit of a tropical note

00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:51.950
to it.

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.610
So I brought some passion fruit.

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:56.160
Has anybody seen
passion fruit before?

00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:00.590
It looks really kind of
boring, and almost like a rock.

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:05.770
Until you open it and you
get this gorgeous pink-ey,

00:37:05.770 --> 00:37:08.722
orange, beautifulness.

00:37:08.722 --> 00:37:11.180
So we're just going to scrape
a little bit of passion fruit

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:12.096
season seeds on there.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.730
Yep.

00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:18.210
It'll only scrape so much.

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.209
The seeds are really going
to be the only thing.

00:37:20.209 --> 00:37:22.786
This white stuff in
there won't really

00:37:22.786 --> 00:37:24.786
come off unless you're
super aggressive with it.

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.790
And then we're just
finish this off

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.248
with a little bit
of almond brittle

00:37:31.248 --> 00:37:35.670
just to make it more
desert-ey, and also to give it

00:37:35.670 --> 00:37:37.410
another fun, crunchy, texture.

00:37:40.098 --> 00:37:43.170
And that is your
healthy dessert.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:43.670
Ooh.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:45.130
All right, here we go.

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:46.470
AUDIENCE: Ooh.

00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.310
DAKOTA WEISS: All right,
who wants to try this?

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:50.214
Me, yeah.

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.470
Conveniently have
them done for you.

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.510
So does seem easy enough?

00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:08.707
Do you feel confident you
could go home and make it?

00:38:08.707 --> 00:38:10.415
Absolutely, yeah that's
the right answer.

00:38:20.450 --> 00:38:23.640
And then if you want the
recipes for all of this

00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:26.640
they will be uploaded on my
website later this evening.

00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:39.940
Oh my lord, that is
a loaded question.

00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:43.240
I'm going to have to go
with probably the simpler

00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:45.760
things such as like
a beef bourguignon.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:48.440
I really like the
comfort-ey, braised meats

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.240
that you really put
a lot of time into.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.410
Yeah, I would say that.

00:38:53.410 --> 00:38:56.730
Plus it's classic, and I
love those classic dishes.

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.120
And it reminds me of my grandma.

00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:07.130
Underrated?

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:10.400
Well about six months ago I
probably would've said kale,

00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.985
but now you can't
get away from kale.

00:39:11.985 --> 00:39:14.990
It's pretty much everywhere.

00:39:14.990 --> 00:39:18.020
I have to say just a lot
of the random bitter greens

00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:23.420
like tot soy, lola rosa, frisee.

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.369
I think usually when
you get a mesclun salad

00:39:26.369 --> 00:39:28.160
and you see all the
crazy lettuce in there,

00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:29.910
people are like, I
don't want these weeds.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:31.410
Why are they feeding me weeds?

00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:34.282
Those weeds taste
really delicious.

00:39:34.282 --> 00:39:35.990
And I don't think
they're utilized a lot.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:42.690
What's that?

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:43.930
Do I eat Cajun foods?

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:50.890
Not too much, however
I did used to work

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.670
at the Ritz Carlton in Sarasota.

00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:54.616
And my restaurant
there was based,

00:39:54.616 --> 00:39:56.240
because it was on
the Gulf, we based it

00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:59.000
on all the different
areas of the Gulf Sea.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.290
And so I did have
some Cajun stuff.

00:40:02.290 --> 00:40:05.930
And I made a really
good jambalaya risotto,

00:40:05.930 --> 00:40:07.910
which basically you
just make a base risotto

00:40:07.910 --> 00:40:11.960
and then add the ingredients
of a jambalaya to that.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.620
We did the shrimp
brazed in molasses.

00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.390
So that's probably the
extent of my Cajun cooking

00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:19.680
but I do love eat it.

00:40:24.870 --> 00:40:27.070
The andouille sausage?

00:40:27.070 --> 00:40:28.030
Absolutely.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:29.790
You can't have Cajun
food without that.

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:36.270
Probably not very traditional
to what it should be.

00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:41.050
All right.

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:44.620
Go ahead and grab a
spoon and a parfait.

00:40:48.770 --> 00:40:51.660
You can see in this once
you get into there the bits

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.300
and pieces of the almond too.

00:40:58.421 --> 00:40:58.920
Yeah.

00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:01.920
We'll put it on my
website, chefdakota.com

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:05.070
soon as we get home.

00:41:05.070 --> 00:41:06.160
The dressing on those?

00:41:18.511 --> 00:41:20.760
Kind of hard to get everything
on those little spoons.

00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.390
But it serves the point.

00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.800
So any last questions
on anything?

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.830
You can actually with it.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:38.130
I've not made it, but the class
that I took to make yogurt,

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:39.840
they made it from coconut milk.

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.520
They did something
else really outrageous,

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:47.230
I was like oh my god.

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.165
It wasn't a nut though,
but it's really fun.

00:41:50.165 --> 00:41:52.540
I think just as long as you've
got the temperatures right

00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:55.520
and you let it sit long enough,
and you don't peak or poke

00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.370
at it, it's going to happen.

00:41:57.370 --> 00:41:58.700
Science, it's awesome.

00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:03.546
Anything else?

00:42:03.546 --> 00:42:05.490
You guys like it?

00:42:05.490 --> 00:42:06.110
Good?

00:42:06.110 --> 00:42:08.110
All right, well thank you
so much for coming in.

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:11.420
I appreciate it.

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:12.990
I don't.

00:42:12.990 --> 00:42:15.557
Thank you.

00:42:15.557 --> 00:42:16.640
Yeah, we didn't bring any.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:18.556
We just brought a few
jars, but you can always

00:42:18.556 --> 00:42:20.610
get some at chefdakota.com.

00:42:20.610 --> 00:42:23.090
Just click on Pop Parlor.

00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:24.000
So thanks again.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.150
I appreciate it.
