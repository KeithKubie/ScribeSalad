00:00:12.881 --> 00:00:16.532
Jeanie, Will and Adina
are three senior citizens

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:19.380
connected by a special relationship.

00:00:19.873 --> 00:00:23.893
They view their bond as a shield
from the loneliness of aging.

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:27.475
I first met them at a retirement
home in Los Angeles,

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.545
where I had been photographing
for three years.

00:00:30.569 --> 00:00:33.244
I saw as they approached
the gate one night,

00:00:33.268 --> 00:00:36.001
and felt an immediate connection to them.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:40.434
Although I didn't know the details
of their love triangle,

00:00:40.458 --> 00:00:44.656
I intuitively felt
that I had to find out who they were.

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.196
Questioning a nurse
a day later, she said to me,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.173
"Oh, you're talking about the threesome."

00:00:52.197 --> 00:00:53.378
(Laughter)

00:00:53.402 --> 00:00:54.934
I was intrigued.

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:57.703
(Laughter)

00:00:57.727 --> 00:01:01.823
The trio set out on a daily adventure
to coffee and doughnut shops,

00:01:01.847 --> 00:01:03.780
bus stops and street corners.

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:08.133
I soon learned that the purpose
of these outings was solace

00:01:08.157 --> 00:01:10.014
and a search for meaning.

00:01:10.038 --> 00:01:13.268
The trio sought to combat their alienation

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:17.069
by literally integrating themselves
in public streets.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.287
Yet, even when arm in arm,
no one saw them.

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:28.061
We often think that as we age,
we lose the desires held in our youth.

00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:32.244
Actually, as a teenage photojournalist
when I met the trio,

00:01:32.268 --> 00:01:34.674
I saw their behavior as a mirror

00:01:34.698 --> 00:01:38.880
to the fears of exclusion
and desires for intimacy

00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:40.793
that I also carried.

00:01:41.196 --> 00:01:43.903
I related to their invisibility,

00:01:43.927 --> 00:01:46.410
which pained me during my childhood

00:01:46.434 --> 00:01:51.506
but has become my greatest asset
as an immersive documentarian,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.616
because I can just fade into my empathy.

00:01:55.498 --> 00:01:57.569
As we walked down
the streets of Hollywood,

00:01:57.593 --> 00:02:01.061
in a neighborhood of screenwriters,
actors and filmmakers,

00:02:01.085 --> 00:02:05.423
the trio assumed the invisibility
that each senior does.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.680
I would ask myself,

00:02:07.704 --> 00:02:11.974
"How is it that no one else
sees these three human beings?

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.093
Why is it that I am
the only one who sees them?"

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:20.490
Years later, as I began to share
this work with the public,

00:02:20.514 --> 00:02:24.712
I noticed that people are largely
uncomfortable with this story.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:29.315
Perhaps it is because the trio
doesn't assume conventional notions

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:33.156
associated with love,
romance or partnership.

00:02:33.617 --> 00:02:37.579
They were unseen in public
and shunned by their peers.

00:02:37.898 --> 00:02:40.318
They wanted to belong somewhere

00:02:40.342 --> 00:02:43.142
but only seemed to belong with each other.

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:45.895
I wanted to belong somewhere, too.

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:50.185
And my camera has been a catalyst
for me to belong everywhere.

00:02:50.744 --> 00:02:54.617
But beyond challenging sociocultural
norms about the elderly,

00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:57.982
the trio sheds light
on fear of remoteness.

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:03.045
At the end of each day, they return
to their respective retirement homes.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.414
Under the surface of their aloneness,

00:03:06.438 --> 00:03:10.844
there is a desire for community,
for their people.

00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:15.609
There was a sense that they were each
yearning for their tribe,

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:18.545
but that comfort comes with compromise,

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:21.386
because Will cannot commit to one woman.

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:26.019
Sitting with Jeanie one day
in her apartment, she said to me,

00:03:26.043 --> 00:03:29.408
"Sharing Will is a thorn in your side.

00:03:29.432 --> 00:03:33.570
A relationship between a man
and a woman is private.

00:03:33.926 --> 00:03:36.886
It is a couple, not a trio."

00:03:37.926 --> 00:03:41.299
My process is to essentially
become the people I document

00:03:41.323 --> 00:03:45.172
by spending years with them
as an observer-occupant,

00:03:45.196 --> 00:03:49.679
to create a safe space,
to then become hidden in plain sight.

00:03:50.315 --> 00:03:52.855
I was about 17 when I met the trio,

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:55.212
and I shadowed them for four years.

00:03:55.784 --> 00:03:58.974
We actually see, in the breakdown
of social development,

00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:03.378
that adolescence and old age
look strikingly alike,

00:04:03.402 --> 00:04:06.744
because both are periods
of identity confusion.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.878
I identified with the women.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:15.481
But also with Will, who made me
aware of the divide in me.

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.713
The schism that we each often have

00:04:18.737 --> 00:04:23.067
about what we crave
and the actuality of our situation.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:25.697
Before shooting this series,

00:04:25.721 --> 00:04:29.386
I was also in love with two different
people who knew about each other,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.077
being the object over which they fought.

00:04:32.411 --> 00:04:36.403
But I also knew what it was like
to be at the base of the triangle,

00:04:36.427 --> 00:04:38.149
like Jeanie or Adina,

00:04:38.173 --> 00:04:39.831
asking myself,

00:04:39.855 --> 00:04:42.704
"Why aren't I enough?"

00:04:43.442 --> 00:04:47.387
I would look through my viewfinder
and see three elderly figures,

00:04:47.411 --> 00:04:51.792
and it became impossible to deny
that regardless of age,

00:04:51.816 --> 00:04:56.928
we were each in pursuit of filling
the proverbial hole through other people.

00:04:58.305 --> 00:05:02.718
Perhaps the discomfort of looking
at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story

00:05:02.742 --> 00:05:07.807
is truly a reminder
that even at the end of life,

00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:13.082
we may never reach the fantasy
we have envisioned for ourselves.

00:05:13.548 --> 00:05:14.744
Thank you for listening.

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:19.880
(Applause)
