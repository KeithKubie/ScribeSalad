00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.430
Here is a image that describes a common place example of

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.950
the dependency inversion principle. It features, a, situation,

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.180
describes a situation, which there's a lamp that you want to get electricity to.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.870
And the way you do this is by plugging, the lamp into the wall. The lamp depends

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.560
on the abstract plug interface and not on the underlying electrical wiring.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.680
It enables you to plugin a variety of different kinds of lamps and

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.640
other devices as well. We want to, we want to

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.470
come up with a similar way of dealing with that in, in our software designs.
