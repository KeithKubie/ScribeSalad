00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.500
No matter how big a movie may get, or how
many years fans have to watch, and re-watch,

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.059
some incredible secrets can always be found,
guaranteed to make viewers rush for another

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.059
viewing.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.440
There's no studio in the world like the one
founded by Walt Disney, so it's no surprise

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.600
that their animated films have more secrets
to give than most.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.500
Here's another dose of rapid fire movie trivia
in our next instalment of Know Your Movies:

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.470
20 Disney Movie Secrets That Will Blow Your
Mind.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.700
Frozen
Despite appearing in just a single scene,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.090
fans will never forget Wandering Oaken - what
they probably don't know is his heavily-accented

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.160
voice is actually provided by Chris Williams,
a story artist on the movie, and the co-director

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.700
of Disney's Big Hero 6.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.980
It wasn't just Disney directors who lent their
voice to the movie, but their kids, too.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.150
During the opening song "Do You Want to Build
a Snowman," the voice of young Anna is actually

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.250
Katie Lopez, the daughter of the movie's songwriting
duo.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.520
The teenage Anna gets her voice from Agatha
Lee Monn, the daughter of co-director, Jennifer

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.520
Lee.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.180
Disney's influences come full circle in Frozen,
when Anna's first song sees her mimic the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.030
painting "The Swing" by Jean-HonorÃ© Fragonard.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.869
The painting was recreated as the first piece
of concept art for Tangled years earlier,

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.510
making Rapunzel's cameo appearance even more
fitting.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.409
Tangled
The heroine's heart is stolen by the dangerous

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.829
Flynn Rider, but it's not by accident.

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:28.340
Before production started, the directors gathered
every woman in the studio in a single room,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.799
showing video footage and photos of celebrities
to find out exactly how to make the most attractive

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:33.799
man possible.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:34.799
Hard to argue with the results.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.979
Singer Mandy Moore may have landed the role
of Rapunzel, but it was Natalie Portman who

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.210
the animators looked to for their initial
designs.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.000
The first pencil tests of the princess were
even animated to her performance in the movie

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.619
Closer.

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.780
Fans spin wild theories about every Disney
princess being somehow related in the same

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.369
Royal Family, but as crazy as it sounds, their
genetic traits seem to back it up.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.829
When Tangled added Rapunzel to the studio's
royalty, she was the first Disney Princess

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.710
to have green eyes - EVER.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.159
Who knew?

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.290
Beauty and The Beast
It's hard to imagine anyone but actress Angela

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.069
Lansbury, the voice of Mrs. Potts, singing
the title ballad to this Disney classic, but

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.620
she originally refused, believing a professional
singer should do the job.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.620
The directors convinced her to record a single
version of it just in case - which is the

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.540
exact one in the finished movie.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.190
Disney's artists take months, sometimes years
to design their heroes and villains, but fans

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.260
hardly ever see the original designs.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.900
Luckily, Beauty and the Beast is the exception.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.120
The Beast's animal inspirations are obvious,
but nearly all of the statues seen in his

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.050
mansion were earlier designs of his character.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.000
Aladdin
Robin Williams took a tiny paycheck for his

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.239
role as Genie, in exchange for assurances
his memorable dialogue couldn't be used in

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.069
toys and merchandise - but the studio did
it anyway.

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.890
Williams refused an apology, and even an original
Picasso painting from Disney's CEO, meaning

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.120
the role had to be re-cast before things were
patched up years later.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.120
The movie and its soundtrack helped kick of
the Disney Renaissance, but at first, people

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.329
didn't realize just how special it was.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.670
When test audiences sat in silence for each
song, the animators added an "Applause" sign

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.280
after Genie's big number as an inside joke.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.430
It worked, so the sign stayed in the finish
cut.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.420
The Lion King
Every movie looking to make animals act like

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.410
humans can take cues from The Lion King - but
fans probably don't know that not a single

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.970
real lion's roar was recorded for the movie.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.129
Despite sounding like they were recorded in
the wild, legendary voice actor Frank Welker

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.909
created them all himself.

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:31.549
Toy Story
Not many fans know that the part of Buzz Lightyear

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.700
was first offered to Billy Crystal, who claimed
turning it down was the biggest mistake he'd

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.700
ever made.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.959
So when Pixar boss John Lasseter called years
later, he picked up the phone and answered

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.459
"yes" before his part in Monsters, Inc. could
even be offered.

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:45.900
Monsters, Inc.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.620
While recording her dialogue as Mike Wazowski's
girlfriend, actress Jennifer Tilly raved to

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.400
the Pixar staff about a movie script being
written by Brad Bird, a director on her husband's

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.590
show, The Simpsons.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.769
Just a few years later, Bird's story of a
superpowered family in the 1960s would be

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.750
made a reality as The Incredibles.&nbsp;

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.640
The Incredibles
When director Brad Bird offered the role of

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.370
Violet Parr to Sarah Vowell, the author, essayist
and regular guest on the This American Life

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.360
radio show refused, claiming she wasn't an
actress.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.190
Determined to get her one of a kind voice
into the movie, Bird had Violet animated to

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.250
one of her guest spots, proving she was more
of an actress than she realized.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.150
Finding Nemo
To get his story of a lost clownfish into

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.550
production, director Andrew Stanton delivered
an hour long pitch to Pixar boss John Lasseter.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.500
Relying on voices, acting out scenes, and
claiming the movie could be Pixar's biggest

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.300
hit yet left Stanton exhausted once the hour
was up.

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.690
It was then that Lasseter broke the silence
by simply saying: "you had me at 'fish.'"

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.200
Stanton's performances must've been good,
too.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.620
When his temporary dialogue tracks as Crush,
the laid back, surfer sea turtle earned praise

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.860
from his co-workers during test screenings,
he took the part for good.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.860
To get the beach attitude perfect, Stanton
recorded all of his lines while comfortably

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.420
reclining on the couch in his office.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.380
Wreck-it Ralph
Disney had been developing a movie following

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.340
video game characters since the 1980s, and
"High Score" became "Joe Jump" with the success

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.370
of Super Mario in the 1990s.

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.360
In fact, it re-entered development as 'Fix-it
Felix' in the 2000s - before they realized

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.000
that the 'bad guy' would make an even better
hero.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.811
Inside Out
The idea of actually casting actors as the

00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:28.310
emotions inside a young girl's head was an
instant hit with Pixar's leadership, with

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.090
the idea of casting comedian Lewis Black as
Anger apparently the first example offered.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.510
There was no better option, which meant their
first prediction came true, and Black played

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.849
the part to perfection.

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:42.259
Cars
Pixar decided to bring their world of cars

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.590
to life a bit differently, using the windshields
as eyes, instead of the cars' headlights,

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.120
like most cartoons.

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.551
The result was a unique look for the studio
and franchise, but it was actually over 50

00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:57.449
fifty years old - first used in the 1952 Disney
cartoon Susie the Little Blue Coupe (one of

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.180
John Lasseter's favorites).

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.500
Ratatouille
The movie might seem like pure fantasy, but

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.849
celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain praised Ratatouille
as the most faithful and accurate film about

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:09.490
cooking he had ever seen.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.729
From the attention to actual food, flavors
and recipes, down to the almost invisible

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.590
scars marking the characters' forearms - badges
of honor among veteran chefs.

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:18.590
scars visible on hands/wrist.

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:19.590
&nbsp;

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.520
Those are some of our favorite details and
behind-the-scenes stories from Disney's animated

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.530
