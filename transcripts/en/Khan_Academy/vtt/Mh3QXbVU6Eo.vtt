00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.470
- [Instructor] The folks
you see in this picture

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.170
are two NASA astronauts

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.870
who also happen to be identical twins.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.990
On the left here, this is Mark Kelly,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:12.530
you can see his name on
his patch right over there,

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.850
and then this is Scott Kelly.

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:16.780
And the reason why we want to look

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.160
at these two astronauts in particular

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.090
is to think about genotype and phenotype

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.730
that we have been introduced
to in other videos.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.470
So just as a bit of a review,

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.370
when people talk about genotype,

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:32.060
they're talking about the
actual genetic information

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.760
encoded in an organism's genes.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.840
So, if you go inside a
cell we have chromosomes

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.310
and then on those
chromosomes, there are long,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.430
each chromosome's a long stretch of DNA.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.540
And then sections of
that long stretch of DNA

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.300
will code for various things,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.490
often usually various proteins.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.250
But there's a difference
between what is actually,

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.470
what information is in one's genes

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.830
versus what actually gets expressed.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.623
The observable characteristics,
that is phenotype,

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.580
and two people with the same genotype

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.010
they might have a very similar phenotype

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.210
but they won't necessarily
have an identical phenotype

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.090
because above and beyond the
genes affecting phenotype,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.250
you also have the environment

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.390
affecting someone's phenotype.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.330
So, as you can see here,
Mark and Scott Kelly,

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.680
they're identical twins,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.400
they have the same genotype.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.390
But if you just look at
their facial characteristics

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.870
you can see that you could tell

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.940
the difference between the two,

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.250
and it's not just the fact
that Mark has a mustache

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.530
and that Scott doesn't, we
could draw in a mustache,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.890
we would still see that
they look different.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.270
And that's because their bodies
developed in different ways

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.030
based off the environment
that they happen to be in.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.540
And this idea that the same genotype

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.870
could result in variations of phenotype,

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.810
this is known as phenotype plasticity.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.023
Phenotype.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.420
Phenotype plasticity.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.090
And maybe in one of the
most extreme experiments

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.570
ever conducted on phenotype plasticity,

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.170
NASA was intrigued to see,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.710
well, what would happen
to the gene expression

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.830
if Scott Kelly spent an
extensive period of time in space

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.960
while his twin brother didn't.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.230
So they looked at how
their bodies expressed

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.010
certain characteristics before Scott spent

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.030
an extended period of time in space.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.030
And then after he spent that time in space

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.020
they studied his body

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.960
and they saw that there was
differences in the mitochondria,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.380
differences in which genes were expressed.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.580
In fact, there was a 7%
difference in the gene expression

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.170
after the extended time
in space for Scott.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.710
So that's the example of
that space environment

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.570
changing Scott's phenotype.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.800
And the NASA scientists theorized

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.440
that it was a low oxygen environment

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.150
there was a lot of carbon
dioxide in that environment,

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.120
there were stressors from space travel

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.320
that would have affected how the genotype

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.670
which is identical to his
brother, Mark's genotype,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.450
how it might have been expressed

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.770
resulting in the phenotype plasticity

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.140
above and beyond what
other changes in phenotype

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.500
between Scott and Mark accumulated

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.100
over the course of their lives

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.413
despite having the same
genetic information.
