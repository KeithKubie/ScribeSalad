MALE SPEAKER: Is it here yet?

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:09.674
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: No,
still showing 7.3.

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:11.590
MALE SPEAKER: I'm sure
they haven't forgotten.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.570
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: I'll tell
you what, they'd better not

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.460
have forgotten.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.585
MALE SPEAKER: That's right.

00:00:19.842 --> 00:00:22.000
What about now?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.820
[CHIMES]

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.695
MAGNUS HYTTSTEN: Yes!

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:24.290
Yes!

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.290
It's here!

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.820
Google Play services
7.5 just got installed.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.630
It's here!

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.540
It's here!

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.920
Welcome to Google
Play services 7.5.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.060
This is an epic release
with lots of new features

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.750
that allows you to
build better apps.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.300
That's right, because that's
what this is all about.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.520
Enabling you to
build better apps.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.790
We're so excited and there's
so much new stuff in here

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.450
that we must get
started right away.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.310
Google Cloud Messaging is
one of the most powerful APIs

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.200
in Google Play
services, providing

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.640
messaging between your mobile
app and the back end server.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.880
And now we've made
it even better

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.630
with support for topic
based subscriptions.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.520
Before topics, all the apps
running all the devices

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.480
had to filter out messages
that were not relevant.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.440
Because it was not
possible for the running

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.160
app to tell GCM which
messages it was interested in.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.590
Well, with the new topic
based subscriptions

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.010
this problem is solved.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.170
Simply define the topic
string that you subscribe to.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.960
For example, topics
hockey, and then GCM

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.020
will send messages only
to the devices that

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.870
have subscribed to the topic.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.850
This saves bandwidth,
battery resources,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.710
and you write less code.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.850
That's why this is amazing.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.780
And the subscription filters
are really flexible too.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.110
You can use any classification
after the topics keyword

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.550
to define your topics.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.120
For example, the latest
episode of my favorite show,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.980
my favorite hockey
team, or my only stock.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.130
In this release we also have
the GCM network manager,

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.020
which will schedule your
background tasks whenever

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.570
most appropriate for
efficiency and battery savings.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.919
Perfect when syncing data with
servers when new information

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:11.400
becomes available.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.570
Using GCM network manager
you can configure tasks

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.320
to run either as one offs,
meaning that they run once,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:19.880
or periodically.

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.700
And in addition
to that, it's also

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.730
possible to specify conditions
that must be satisfied

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.550
before the task is executed.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.830
For example, the task
probably requires network.

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.770
But it goes even beyond that.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.740
You can also require that
the network is unneeded.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.050
For example, a Wi-Fi network.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.050
Or that the device needs
to be charging white

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.310
executing the task.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.690
So lots of good
flexibility here.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.270
And that brings us over
to-- yup, that's right,

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.910
we got a new API.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.835
Let's welcome the app Invites
API with a round of applause.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.280
How many times per day do you
receive generic information

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.860
from big corporations
that want your attention?

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.230
Lots of times.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.300
And most of the times
you ignore them.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.120
Just because it's coming from
a big corporation and it's

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.750
a generic message.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.880
But what if you instead
receive the recommendation

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.580
from a friend?

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.570
That's a completely
different situation.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.850
Your friend invested
time and energy

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.610
to send you a recommendation.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.790
You'd better look at that.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.710
That's what app
Invites is all about.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.700
And now we're
launching it in beta.

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.470
Enabling your users to
invite their friends

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.110
to check out your app, like
a friend recommendation.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.870
They just select
the people they want

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.160
to invite from their Google
contacts, or use email, or SMS.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.510
And it's even possible to
have a deep link in the invite

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.450
so users can get directly to
a particular piece of content

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.180
in the app that you
are recommending.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.780
Now over to Cast,
that allows your app

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.270
to show things on many
millions of displays.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.660
And in this release
Cast includes a new API

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.280
called the Remote Display API.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.610
Wouldn't it be great if
an app on your device

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.170
could display content
on the Cast receiver

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.930
and at the same time show
other content on your device?

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:14.910
That's exactly what the
Remote Display API enables.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.510
With this API you're app
would have two screens it

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.880
can read the content to.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.530
One of the screens is
displayed by the Cast receiver

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.930
on the remote display.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.530
And the other is
displayed on your device.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.530
This means you
could for example,

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.480
create a game where you see
the action on a big display,

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.490
and you use your device as the
remote control for the game.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.320
And hey, now the Maps API
is now natively supported

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.000
on Android Wear devices.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.320
It's now possible to present
fully interactive maps

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.540
on a wearable device that
includes scrolling and zooming.

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:49.170
You could also show Street View.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.560
This baby uses current position,
uses lites mode maps, and much,

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.770
much more.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.075
Another feature in this
release is Smart Lock

00:04:57.075 --> 00:05:01.210
for password, which allows
you to be automatically signed

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.130
in to a Chrome website or
Android app with your Google

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.400
account.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.080
Let's look at an example
of how this can work.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.840
Say you sign into a website and
choose to save the password,

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.860
then this password gets
securely saved in the cloud.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.100
At a later time you decide to
start a corresponding Android

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.730
app.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.990
The Smart Lock for password API
can then allow a sign in simply

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.390
by selecting the
stored credential.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.380
This is possible since
you have previously

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:31.620
decided to store the
password from Chrome.

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.610
And the Android device has
your Google account registered.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.960
This is just one use case
for Smart Lock for password,

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.070
which has many more features.

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.730
So be sure to check out the
details in the reference

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.550
sections at the
end of this video.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.600
And rounding this release
off with news in Google Fit

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.030
that now support a very large
number of exercise types.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.900
Here they are, all of them.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.210
And the java log will even
include descriptions of how

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.320
to physically perform them.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.600
And for each of
these you can record

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.020
the number of repetitions, the
resistance, and the resistance

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.970
type.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.760
And while I have no idea
what most of these are,

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.500
there is one I do recognize.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.230
Bicep curl.

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.440
Let's try that out
in the real world.

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.422
[HEAVY BREATHING]

00:06:24.422 --> 00:06:29.630
[SQUEALING]

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:33.830
That's it for this release video
of Google Play services 7.5.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.550
But be sure to check out
these resources as well.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.080
Now it's your turn to
build those better apps.

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.725
So go out there and
create some great apps.

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.078
And don't forget to
tell us all about it.
