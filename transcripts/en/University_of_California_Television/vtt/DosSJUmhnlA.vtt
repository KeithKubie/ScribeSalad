00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.910
- [Rachel] So I want to start this story
actually in the 1800s. So in 1800 a young

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:14.390
physician named Itard, decided to take on
the task of teaching a young boy French.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.660
Turns out that this young boy, they think
was between 10 and 12 years old, he had no

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.590
language and he'd been discovered running
in the woods naked and unable to

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.120
communicate. Itard thought that this was a
very important task because he thought

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.550
that civilization was based on the ability
to empathize and also on language. So he

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.440
tried valiantly for two years to teach
this young boy named Victor, he named him

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.840
Victor because over this two year time
spent the only language that or sounds

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.880
that this young boy could make was the
French Er, which sounds like Victor and he

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.850
had his name. But after two years Victor
was unable to speak any French and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.450
comprehended very little French and
primarily communicated with objects. And

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.150
then Itard wrote this up, after two years
he wrote up his findings and he said that

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.070
he thought that a major reason why Victor
didn't learn French was because he was

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.040
simply too old. But of course, this was
the 1800s and he didn't speculate as to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.680
what it was about being 10 years old with
no language, that would prevent you from

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.150
learning language if you had a daily tutor
trying to teach you French. There's an

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.120
enormous amount of irony in this
particular story because Itard was the

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.040
house physician for the first school for
the deaf in the entire world and here we

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.170
have a picture of it. The first school for
the deaf was begun in 1760 in Paris and at

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:52.360
the time that Itard was teaching Victor,
he was at the school with all of these

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.480
children who use sign language and all of
these teachers who use sign language.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.680
Nonetheless it never occurred to him, to
try to teach Victor sign language.

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.270
But we can't blame him because in the
1800s, sign language was not considered to

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.770
be a language. And in fact, that
particular discovery and realization

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.660
wouldn't happen for another century and a
half, and so we can imagine why he didn't

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.040
teach Victor sign language. The question
is, could Victor have actually learned

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.360
sign language if Itard had tried to teach
it to him? And so, I'm going to try to

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:32.360
answer that question today through a
series of studies. But before I talk about

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.700
our studies, I want to talk about
something that all of the speakers who

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.810
have preceded me have talked about, which
is that one thing that's the defining

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:45.240
characteristic of language is that it's
highly structured. And it's highly

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.810
structured at all of these multiple
levels, so that the speech sounds make up

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:56.290
words, words make up words and phonemes
and these words are strung together in

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.010
sentences with syntax, and this specific
syntax helps us understand and produce

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:10.010
very specific kinds of meanings.
Now one aspect of this language structure

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:15.430
is that humans have evolved to the point
where children learn this structure

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.790
naturally, nobody has to teach them,
nobody has to have a tutor to sit with

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.380
them for two years, to teach them the
structure of French or the structure of

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.830
English, or the structure of ASL. Simply
by being around people who use a language,

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.920
young children naturally acquire all of
these multi-leveled and complicated

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.830
structure. That is to say all children do
this if in fact they can access the

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.480
language around them, if they have normal
hearing they're born with normal hearing,

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:47.650
they hear people talk and before you know
it they're talking themselves. But if

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:53.060
children are born profoundly deaf, they
cannot hear the speech around them and we

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.040
know that lip reading is insufficient to
learn language because most of the speech

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.760
sounds are invisible. What happens to
these children if there's no sign language

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.720
in the environment, they can't learn a
visual form of language either.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:11.130
So it happens that there are large numbers
of children who actually are like Victor

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:15.060
in the sense that they grow up without
language, without learning a language but

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.500
they are unlike Victor in that they were
running around in the woods nude and

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.360
having a very harsh life. So how does a
lack of language in childhood affect the

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.810
ability to learn language or does it
affect ability to learn language? And this

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.400
has been the focus of studies that we have
been doing for many years in our

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.810
laboratory. Because we're using deaf
children and sign language is a means some

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.940
model, language acquisition and its effect
on the brain. I think it's appropriate

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.700
that I talk a little bit about the kinds
of stimuli we do and about American Sign

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:54.320
Language. So first of all, you should know
that American sign language unlike many

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.990
the sign languages that have been
discussed up to this point is a very

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:03.330
sophisticated language, it's evolved
clearly over 200 years. You might even say

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:07.530
that American sign language evolved with
the development of the United States of

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:13.210
America and spread as civilization went
across, as white man went across the

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.410
continent.
So American Sign Language has a

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.880
phonological system and more phonological
system syntax and so forth. So for those

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.910
of you who don't know sign, I know there
are many people here who didn't know sign,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:30.120
I want to show you what some of this
structure looks like. So I'm going to play

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.400
you two video tapes and for those of you
who don't know sign, I would like you to

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.950
guess which one is syntactically
structured, and for those of you who do

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.060
know sign, maybe you could keep the answer
to yourselves.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:54.560
That's one, here's two.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:08.560
So how many think two? How many think one?
Okay, for those of you who think 2, I

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:21.880
captioned this. So this is really Kon dird
lun blid mackers gancakes. Number 1 is

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:33.700
A fully formed sentence with a subordinate
clause. The reason I'm showing you these

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.880
two sentences is for those of you who
don't know the language, you can't

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.740
perceive or parse this particular
structure. This is what knowing a language

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:47.360
is about. For those of you who know ASL
and who know this language, you know that

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.770
the second example had all of these signs
which were non-signs, possible signs but

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:57.790
really just non-signs. This is part of
what knowing language is about, how do

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.640
people learn this particular structure and
the question that we're interested in

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:08.550
this, how does being a young child help
people learn this particular structure? So

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.540
we did a series of experiments, when we
started this work it wasn't even clear

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.140
that age would make a difference in sign
language acquisition. Sign language is

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:20.470
gestural, sign language is mimetic maybe
anybody can learn sign language at any

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:24.540
time in their lives.
So in one experiment what we did is we

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:30.070
recruited a number of people, this is in
Canada, who are born deaf and who use ASL

00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:35.100
and we asked them, we created an
experiment where we had a set of sentences

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:39.260
that varied in complexity and we showed
them these ASL sentences, and we asked

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:43.490
them simply to point to a picture that
reflected the meaning of the sentence that

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:50.870
they saw. And we were quite struck by our
findings, what you see here is that deaf

00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:54.780
people who learned ASL from birth, from
their parents perform very very well in

00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.150
this task. In contrast to deaf people who
were adults who've been signing for over

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.940
20 years performed at chance.
So they had great difficulty understanding

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:10.210
some of these basic sentences in ASL. So
this suggest that there are age of

00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:14.900
acquisition effects for sign as they are
for spoken language, everybody sort of the

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.260
word on the street is it's much harder to
learn a language if you're an adult than

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.010
if you're a child. But what if it's
something deeper than this? What if

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:26.160
there's something about learning a
language in childhood that sets up the

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.890
ability to learn language that creates the
ability to learn language? And so we did

00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:36.690
another experiment also in Canada, but we
decided in order to test this particular

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:42.440
hypothesis we should switch languages. So
we're no longer testing ASL here, what

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:47.390
we're testing here is English we devised
an experiment in English where we had a

00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:51.710
setup sentences and some of them are
ungrammatical and some of them were

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.030
grammatical. This is a common kind of task
that's psycho-linguists use.

00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:02.420
And notice here that the people who were
born profoundly deaf, and for whom ASL was

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.620
a first language are near native in
English. So this is a second language, so

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:12.130
learning a language early even though it's
in sign helps people learn a second

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.590
language, and notice also that their
performance was indistinguishable from

00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:22.440
normally hearing people who had learned
other languages at birth, German, Urdu,

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:27.170
Spanish and French. So there seems to be
that there's something about learning a

00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:31.030
language early in life regardless of
whether it's a sign language or a spoken

00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:35.490
language that actually helps people learn
more language. It's not simply learning

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:40.480
language when one is little. But as also
part of this experiment we tested a group

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:44.690
of individuals who've been signing for 20
years and had gone through the educational

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:50.210
system in Canada who were born deaf. And
on this task they performed at chance. In

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.940
the grammaticality judgment task it's
either yes or no, so it's a chance. So we

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.770
see that individuals who are deprived of
language, who aren't able to learn

00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:04.280
language at a young age performed poorly
on their primary language sign language

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:08.940
and they perform very poorly on a second
language which is ASL and we see the

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.530
reverse.
So there's something really special going

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:16.700
on here about learning language at an
early age and what might this be and might

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:24.200
it be in the brain? So in another set of
studies, what we did is take this

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:28.080
population that we have been looking at
and we decided to neural image their

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.350
language processing. To see whether this
might give us some clues to differences

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.570
between first and second language learners
and people who had language and people who

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:41.320
did not have language. So in this study
also done in Canada with colleagues at the

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:47.640
Montreal Neurological Institute, we did
MRI or FMRI and maybe many of you have had

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:53.410
MRI's. And we showed the subjects
sentences like the sentences that you saw

00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:59.080
and we ask them to make grammatical
judgments on these sentences. And we

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:04.180
tested 22 people, they were all born
profoundly deaf, they all used American

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.450
Sigh Language as a primary language, they
had all gone through the educational

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:13.150
system but they ranged in the age of which
they were first able to acquire language,

00:13:13.330 --> 00:13:16.000
this is all the way from birth up to age
14.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:21.060
So if the age at which you learn your
first language doesn't make a difference,

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.460
then we should expect the neural
processing patterns of all of these

00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.830
individuals to be similar. If age of
acquisition makes a difference, we should

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:34.620
see different patterns in the brain and in
fact this is what we found. When we did

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:39.160
the analysis, we found that there were
seven regions in the brain primarily in

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:44.410
the left hemisphere and as you know now
the left hemisphere has areas that are

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:49.940
responsible for language. And one fact
that we found was that in the language

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.480
regions of the left hemisphere, the
earlier the person learned their first

00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:59.870
language the more activation we saw in the
language hemisphere. However, the older

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:04.740
the person was when they learned their
first language, the less activation we got

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.840
in the language areas of the brain.
So if there's less activation, is there

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.410
something else going on here? And we
actually found a second effect which we

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:19.600
were not expecting at all, which is in the
back part of the brain, the posterior part

00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:26.230
of the brain, in visual processing which
is this particular effect was that the

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:31.360
longer the person matured without
language, the older they were when they

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:37.400
learned language we found greater
activation, more neural resources being

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:42.550
devoted to visual processing. So we see
that here in this group of deaf signers we

00:14:42.730 --> 00:14:49.360
have two complimentary reciprocal effects
of when a child learns his or her, when an

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:53.460
individual learns their first language and
what the brain seems to be doing in terms

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.620
of processing that language. So that for
people who learned language early in life

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.460
almost all of their neural resources are
devoted to processing the meaning and

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.230
structure of that language.
For people who learned their first

00:15:04.410 --> 00:15:08.510
language later in life, more neural
resources are devoted to just trying,

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:13.570
perhaps to figure out what the signal was,
was it this'll work, was it glum or was it

00:15:13.750 --> 00:15:19.600
gleam. So we have this reciprocal
relationship between perceptual processing

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:24.290
and language processing. This particular
pattern is not unique to deaf signers

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.970
there's work by Tim Brown and Schleger
that show that younger children often have

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:33.980
more posterior activation than older
children, and there are also some clinical

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.790
population such as autistic individuals.
Particularly those who's language skills

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:44.660
are not well developed, will often show
more processing in the occipital lobe, so

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.490
this is not a pattern that is unique to
deafness. So the next question we had is

00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:56.090
whether in fact is, how does language
develop when an individual first starts to

00:15:56.270 --> 00:16:01.010
learn it, when they're much older for
example, when they are a teen.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:06.190
We have been very fortunate to have
followed five or six children in our

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:12.670
laboratory who had no language until they
were 13 to 14 years of age for a variety

00:16:12.850 --> 00:16:17.870
of reasons. Two of these children are from
the United States, these other children

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.030
are from other countries. And actually,
this particular circumstance where we

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:26.110
might think of it as being very rare is
actually very common particularly in

00:16:26.290 --> 00:16:31.860
underdeveloped countries. And so, the way
in which we have observed or analyzed the

00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.280
language acquisition is to use normal
procedures that people used to study

00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:40.520
children's language acquisition, we get a
lot of spontaneous data from them and we

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.410
analyze it. And the one question we have
is, if you are 13 years old and you don't

00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:49.420
have a language system, will you develop
language like a baby or will you do

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:53.040
something else because you have a
developed cognitive system, we jump in the

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:57.260
middle of the task and how will this
progress?

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:02.070
To answer this question we need to look a
little bit at how normally hearing

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:07.370
children or deaf or hearing children
develop language when they are exposed to

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:13.320
it at a young age. The major hallmark of
children's language acquisition is that

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.130
they vary quickly as they are acquiring
the grammar of their language, their

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:22.130
sentences get longer and longer and the
reasons their sentences get longer and

00:17:22.310 --> 00:17:27.390
longer is because they're learning all of
these, the morphology, the syntax and as

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:33.540
they're expressing their ideas they're
better able to use grammar to express

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:39.740
them. And so, these data show the average
length of children's expressions. Two of

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:44.580
these children are normally hearing and
acquiring English, and two of these

00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.730
children are acquiring ASL. So we see that
in fact the teens that we have been

00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:54.510
following show no increase in their
language, they're able to learn language

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.410
and put words together but in fact we
don't see an increase in their grammar. In

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.840
the last study we wanted to neural image
these children, we wanted to see what are

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:09.140
their brains doing with the language that
they have and so we used a magno--

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:13.300
We used MAG, Magnetoencephalography which
is a different technique, which is

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:19.040
complementary to the FMRI. And what we did
for this is we studied their vocabulary

00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:22.980
and we made stimulate that we knew that
they knew the words that were in their

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:33.010
vocabulary and it looked something like
this.

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.380
In the first instance the picture matched
sign and the second instance it didn't,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:43.610
and when that happens the brain goes uh-oh
and you get this M400 response and that's

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:47.140
what we were localizing in the brain for
these children. And because we're using

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:53.000
vocabulary that they have, we know that
they knew this words, we asked them to

00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:56.120
press buttons and while they were doing
this task and we knew that they were

00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:01.130
accurate. We didn't only test these
children we also tested control groups, so

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.990
some of these control groups are deaf,
some are hearing, some are first language

00:19:05.170 --> 00:19:09.020
learners and some are second language
learners. The first panel shows the

00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.130
response of a group of normally hearing
adults doing this task while looking at

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:20.700
pictures and listening to words, and this
is data that Katie Travis used also to

00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.540
look at young children's development--
neural development.

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:29.690
The second panel, these are deaf adults
who learned ASL from birth. And you can

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:34.100
see that their processing is very much
like the hearing adult who were speaking

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:38.470
English primarily left hemisphere in the
language areas with some support or help

00:19:38.650 --> 00:19:42.870
from the right hemisphere. And actually,
these patterns are indistinguishable. Both

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:47.170
the hearing adults and the deaf adults
learned language from birth even though it

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:52.200
was in a different form. What's this last
panel? These are college students who are

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:56.600
normally hearing, they have been learning
sign for about three years which is about

00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:02.350
the same amount of time that our cases
were learning language. So we see that

00:20:02.530 --> 00:20:08.250
responding on this task in speech or ASL
whether it's a first language or second

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:13.730
language, so long as the subject had
language from birth looks fairly similar.

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:18.460
What about the cases, we were able to
neural image two cases and you can see

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.530
that their neural processing patterns are
quite different and they look neither like

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:30.220
second language learners nor do they look
like deaf adults. These children have been

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.090
signing for three years and they had no
language before they started to learn how

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:41.090
to sign. You can see primarily that
there's a huge response in the right

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:47.810
hemisphere and the Occipital and Parietal
areas. One of the subjects also show some

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.740
response in the language areas. We can see
that even though they are acquiring

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:54.790
language, they're doing it in a very
different way and their brains are

00:20:54.970 --> 00:21:00.620
responding very differently. So we see
that, in fact, that there are huge effects

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.520
of language environment on both the
development of language, but also how the

00:21:06.700 --> 00:21:10.520
brain processes language.
So we see that it seems to be that the

00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:15.300
human language capacity, both
understanding language and expressing

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.900
language, but also the brain's ability to
process language is very dependent upon

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:26.180
the baby's brain being exposed to or
immersed in language from birth. And it's

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:31.820
through this analyzing language and
working on the data that it's being fed,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.040
that in fact I think that the neural
networks of language are being created. So

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.280
language is a skill that is not innate,
but emerges from the inner action of the

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.310
child with the environment through
linguistic communication, and that was

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:49.970
probably the answer that Itard was looking
for and might be the reason why Victor did

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:53.512
not acquire language. Thank you.
