00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, the best answer is mgh--in fact, that's the only answer. Let's see why.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, let's do a diagram of for example this bucket--there's mass m and weight mg.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The force you exert must balance mg, so actually the magnitude of this force

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that you're pulling on the bucket with must be equal to mg.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
You'll know that this is the equation which describes work and this case,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000
your force is mg and that's upwards which is also the direction of the Δx,

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but here Δx becomes h--so that's how we get that answer.
