00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:15.450
again it's very identifiable you
 

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:19.310
again it's very identifiable you
actually kind of get into the choice

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:19.320
actually kind of get into the choice
 

00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.090
actually kind of get into the choice
he's making and why he's doing it which

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:23.100
he's making and why he's doing it which
 

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:25.250
he's making and why he's doing it which
I really like and again it's one of

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:25.260
I really like and again it's one of
 

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:26.360
I really like and again it's one of
those situations where you identify

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:26.370
those situations where you identify
 

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:27.680
those situations where you identify
because you're saying well if I was

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:27.690
because you're saying well if I was
 

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:30.620
because you're saying well if I was
there what would I do it's tricky and

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:30.630
there what would I do it's tricky and
 

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:32.630
there what would I do it's tricky and
they make it kind of a time crunch to

00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640
they make it kind of a time crunch to
 

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.740
they make it kind of a time crunch to
where you had to make these decisions

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:33.750
where you had to make these decisions
 

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.500
where you had to make these decisions
fast I thought was pretty clever and

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:36.510
fast I thought was pretty clever and
 

00:09:36.510 --> 00:09:40.490

even kind of the weirder song sequences

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:40.500
even kind of the weirder song sequences
 

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.580
even kind of the weirder song sequences
there's there's a wrap done in the

there's there's a wrap done in the
 

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.050
there's there's a wrap done in the
second half I think that's like the only

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:45.060
second half I think that's like the only
 

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.610
second half I think that's like the only
other song done in the second half is

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:49.620
other song done in the second half is
 

00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.190
other song done in the second half is
actually done kind of well it is done

00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200
actually done kind of well it is done
 

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:54.710
actually done kind of well it is done
very intimidating it doesn't quite feel

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720
very intimidating it doesn't quite feel
 

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.900
very intimidating it doesn't quite feel
it starts off feeling a little phony

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:56.910
it starts off feeling a little phony
 

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:58.760
it starts off feeling a little phony

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:00.450
then it kind of turns into this big
 

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:02.720
then it kind of turns into this big

of makes me appreciate this I can help
 

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.290
of makes me appreciate this I can help
even more is because I so thought it was

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:27.300
even more is because I so thought it was
 

00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.600
even more is because I so thought it was
gonna go the direction that the first

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:29.610
gonna go the direction that the first
 

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.890
gonna go the direction that the first
half is setting up

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:30.900
half is setting up
 

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:32.660
half is setting up
because it was so playing it by the

00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:32.670
because it was so playing it by the
 

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.760
because it was so playing it by the
numbers and then suddenly the second

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:34.770
numbers and then suddenly the second
 

00:10:34.770 --> 00:10:37.700
numbers and then suddenly the second
half gets really interesting and I wish

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:37.710
half gets really interesting and I wish
 

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:39.830
half gets really interesting and I wish
the first half was either as interesting

00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:39.840
the first half was either as interesting
 

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.490
the first half was either as interesting
or was a lot funnier but with what we

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:43.500
or was a lot funnier but with what we
 

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.190
or was a lot funnier but with what we
got I think this is pretty good so if

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:46.200
got I think this is pretty good so if
 

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.130

these characters are coming from and why

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:55.270
these characters are coming from and why
 

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.050

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480
that so I would say this is actually a
 

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.139
that so I would say this is actually a
very good film for kids even though it

00:13:07.139 --> 00:13:07.149
very good film for kids even though it
 

00:13:07.149 --> 00:13:09.449
very good film for kids even though it
starts off as a very standard film for

00:13:09.449 --> 00:13:09.459
starts off as a very standard film for
 

00:13:09.459 --> 00:13:11.160
starts off as a very standard film for
kids if someone gets really good for

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:11.170
kids if someone gets really good for
 

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.380
kids if someone gets really good for
kids and it turns into

00:13:13.380 --> 00:13:13.390
kids and it turns into
 

00:13:13.390 --> 00:13:17.280
