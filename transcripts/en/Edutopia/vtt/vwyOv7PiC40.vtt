&gt;&gt;Sal Khan: So when most people
think about what education is,

00:00:02.766 --> 00:00:04.256
there's actually a
whole spectrum of stuff.

00:00:04.256 --> 00:00:06.896
So if you imagine over here,
this is kind of the most-

00:00:07.276 --> 00:00:09.136
the most rote form of education.

00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:11.956
This is, you know, your
multiplication facts or dates

00:00:11.956 --> 00:00:13.506
in history or vocabulary.

00:00:13.506 --> 00:00:15.746
And then as you go in this
direction you get kind

00:00:15.746 --> 00:00:17.886
of the more open-ended
and creative things.

00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:23.806
So this is creativity --
creativity and open-endedness.

00:00:24.076 --> 00:00:26.726
And what's happening right now
is there's definitely creativity

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.516
and open-endedness
happening in classrooms,

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.026
but I think almost every
educator I talk to says

00:00:31.026 --> 00:00:34.086
that they wish they had more time
for doing that type of stuff.

00:00:34.146 --> 00:00:37.226
So in a trad- right now our
traditional education system is

00:00:37.226 --> 00:00:40.126
focused kind of on this
part of the spectrum.

00:00:40.296 --> 00:00:43.186
So this is- this is
where it's focused now.

00:00:43.696 --> 00:00:46.466
Now what's been interesting about
Khan Academy is we've been able to --

00:00:46.786 --> 00:00:51.026
with a combination of -- obviously,
we've got videos, we've got software,

00:00:51.026 --> 00:00:53.346
which are our exercises
and our dashboards.

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:55.486
We're gonna have our
community of students

00:00:55.486 --> 00:00:57.206
who are able to help each other.

00:00:57.816 --> 00:01:00.976
We think this virtual
component can start to address --

00:01:01.356 --> 00:01:02.896
can start to address a lot of this.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:05.936
And it goes into things
that are quite conceptual

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:08.126
and quite open-ended
and project-based.

00:01:08.126 --> 00:01:09.886
We have computer science
and other things.

00:01:09.886 --> 00:01:10.876
We have simulations.

00:01:10.876 --> 00:01:13.786
A lot of the videos go into the
conceptual understanding of things,

00:01:14.196 --> 00:01:16.426
but the value here, the value

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:22.186
of what Khan Academy we think can
be over time, is not to replace this,

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:23.386
by no means to replace this.

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:26.086
I have kids myself and I do
not want them to just learn

00:01:26.086 --> 00:01:29.876
from a virtual school or spend
all their time in the classroom.

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:33.566
We think the opportunity is that
the physical classroom then moves

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:34.106
over here.

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:38.526
It becomes even more
open-ended and more creative.

00:01:38.896 --> 00:01:41.716
And so our view of the summer
camp is to really experiment

00:01:41.946 --> 00:01:43.376
with what we can do over here.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:48.126
So this is what we're doing right
over here in our Discovery Lab.

00:01:48.126 --> 00:01:52.156
And that's why you're gonna see at
this "camp" I guess we can call it --

00:01:52.416 --> 00:01:54.896
you're gonna see a lot
more kinds of simulations.

00:01:54.896 --> 00:01:58.386
And when I talk about- we're talking
about real world games: kids trading,

00:01:58.386 --> 00:01:59.516
kids talking to each other.

00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:03.316
We're gonna see a lot of
projects: students building robots,

00:02:03.316 --> 00:02:06.196
students tearing down
electronic devices and figuring

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:07.456
out what all of the things do.

00:02:07.716 --> 00:02:12.466
You're gonna see a lot more real
world, real-world mathematics,

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:14.856
so a lot of probability
and statistics,

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:17.766
and also kind of tactile mathematics.

00:02:17.766 --> 00:02:19.456
We will see three-dimensional
geometry.

00:02:19.456 --> 00:02:22.876
These kids are going to build
three-dimensional Sierpinskis,

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.556
tetrahedrons, and whatever else.

00:02:25.086 --> 00:02:28.986
And so, really, this is all
about "What could the future

00:02:28.986 --> 00:02:30.526
of physical classrooms look like?"

00:02:30.816 --> 00:02:33.206
And this is a really important
point, because whenever people think

00:02:33.206 --> 00:02:36.406
about virtual education, they always
think of it as an either/or: oh,

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:38.256
virtual education versus physical.

00:02:38.256 --> 00:02:40.336
But we think virtual
education is going

00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:44.116
to make physical education
more valuable and, in actuality,

00:02:44.116 --> 00:02:45.596
it makes it even more valuable.

00:02:45.596 --> 00:02:48.956
So, ironically, the kind
of, the school of the future,

00:02:48.956 --> 00:02:52.276
"the physical," in our minds, are
going to become even more important.

00:02:52.556 --> 00:02:54.406
And so what we're hoping to
do is we're gonna experiment

00:02:54.406 --> 00:02:57.906
with all these things, see what
works, what doesn't work and then see

00:02:57.906 --> 00:03:00.946
if we can scale it up to
the rest of the world.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:03.766
We can share what has worked,
and so any teacher, any student,

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.596
any parent anywhere can do
some of these simulations,

00:03:06.646 --> 00:03:09.586
projects and real-world games.
