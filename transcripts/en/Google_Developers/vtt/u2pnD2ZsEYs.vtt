00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:03.320
MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and
gentlemen, please welcome

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.570
Brady Forrest.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.830
BRADY FORREST: Hey there.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:19.710
I'm Brady Forrest.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.240
Thank you all for coming out.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.600
This is the fourth or fifth
Ignited I/O and I think it's

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.860
the biggest one.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.760
At least this year we won't be
hearing Jane's Addiction play

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.470
during our Ignite.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.820
So thanks for coming out.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.200
We've got 12 great speakers,
we're going to hear from a

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.100
number of Googlers.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.860
And in case you've never
actually been to an Ignite

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.340
before, if you don't know what
Ignite is, it's a geek event

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.230
that has spread around
the world.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.590
And it gives people a chance to
share their ideas and share

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.330
their passions in a highly
structured format that really

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.040
lets them to kind of bump up
against constraints and become

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.750
just a bit more creative in how
they present their ideas.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.860
So each of these speakers gets
20 slides that auto-advance

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.650
every 15 seconds for a total
of just five minutes.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.250
So they've had to really
condense their ideas down and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.300
really be able to
drive them home.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.370
And normally this is done
with beer at night.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.590
We don't have that right now
but I think you'll still

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.960
really enjoy the show.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.750
As I mentioned, we've got 11
great speakers and our first

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.680
one is here to talk
about hackathons.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.930
Please welcome up Chiu-Ki.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.580
CHIU-KI CHAN: Hello, my
name is Chiu-Ki Chan.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.653
I'm here to tell you how
to win hackathons.

00:01:48.653 --> 00:01:50.930
I went to my first hackathon
last year in

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.870
September and I won.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.710
That app is actually an
app to teach people

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.740
how to write Chinese.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.730
And it went so well
that I decided to

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:01.373
put it on the market.

00:02:01.373 --> 00:02:05.030
How many of you here have
Android devices?

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.620
All of you?

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.040
Great.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.850
Go download it.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.800
I would really appreciate it.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.740
So after Monkey Write I went on
to three other hackathons

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.970
and one demo.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.470
So I figure that I'll share
my tips with you.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.850
But first, what are
hackathons?

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.540
As this picture shows, just a
bunch of people in front of

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.000
computers, typing away, building
some software.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.160
Usually there's a theme,
sometimes there are prizes.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480
There are three type
of hackathons,

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.810
in my mind, at least.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.195
The first type is the business
model type, where not only do

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:35.770
you have to build software,
you also have to show how

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.290
you're going to make money.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.360
The second type is the
complete opposite.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.850
You are there to help
a nonprofit to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.735
build a technical solution.

00:02:42.735 --> 00:02:45.840
The third type, the type I love,
is the API hackathon,

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.510
where the sponsors will come
dangling lovely gadgets in

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.480
front of you so that you will
build something to the API.

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.160
And then they can showcase
how awesome the API is.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.060
So the best way to think
of that is Iron Chef.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.830
The API is your secret
ingredient and your job is to

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.330
cook up something that looks
good and tastes good.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.620
Now, how does a hackathon
actually go?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.030
Usually, it goes like this.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.440
Come up with an idea, spend
all day hacking along,

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.760
building up your software, and
then you get onstage and you

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.540
present and you demo.

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.360
Now here comes the secret.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.240
There are arrows on this slide,
but they're in the

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.840
wrong direction.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.740
You need to work backwards.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.190
You need to think about the demo
first, because that is

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.560
how you show how awesome
your software is.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.430
You need to figure out how much
time you have and how

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.450
you're being judged.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.890
Once you figure out that part
then you're ready to dazzle

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.180
your crowd.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.225
From there work backwards.

00:03:48.225 --> 00:03:50.020
Figure out how much
time you have.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.910
Don't think of it as, oh, I
have a full-day hackathon.

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.040
Uh-uh-uh.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.750
You need to eat, your
Wi-Fi will go down.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.460
All kinds of stuff
will happen.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.650
So count it in the
number of hours.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.270
A full-day hackathon, I would
say, is a six-hour hackathon.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.110
So know exactly how much time
you have and then budget

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.990
accordingly.

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.980
Don't think of too much
stuff to build.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.000
So the first step is then you
need to study your secret

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.985
ingredient.

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:18.870
So in Iron Chef you
have your crab.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.410
In our case we have APIs.

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.830
Figure out what they do, but
more importantly what you can

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.930
learn within that day and
build something with it.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.190
Once you have those gathered up,
you are finally ready to

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.080
come up with your idea.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.280
Now what makes a good hackathon
idea is something a

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.910
little bit not obvious.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.280
What I mean by that, well, if
your idea is a dime a dozen,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.290
everybody's implementing that,
you won't stand up in the

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.700
crowd, right?

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.800
But then if there's something
that is super out there, you

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.230
don't have time to
implement that.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.500
You have a very short amount
of time during a hackathon.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.710
Besides it's so complicated to
explain that there's no way

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.620
you can show at a demo
why it's a cool idea.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.460
Once you have distilled a very
simple idea that's awesome to

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.270
show, go talk to
this sponsors.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.790
Ask them, see if they think it's
a good idea, and then ask

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:13.960
for pointers.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.720
How can you guess that and
which functions you code.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.480
Take shortcuts.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.880
The sponsors are there
to help you.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.290
Another shortcut that you can
take is only implement the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.735
thing that you are
going to demo.

00:05:25.735 --> 00:05:28.130
I mean sure, go ahead and build
up the whole screen with

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.190
five buttons, but just make one
button work and demo that

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:33.550
button onscreen.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.810
And very importantly,
seek help.

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.570
Give yourself at most a minute
if you are stuck.

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.720
And then ask.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.510
Ask somebody.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.620
You can ask the sponsors, but
you can ask people around you.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.890
Yes, it's a competition, but
the spirit is to help each

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.270
other so just go ahead and ask
and help others as well.

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.040
Remember focus, focus, focus.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.240
Yes you're helping other people
but think about what

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.210
are you going to demo
and focus on that.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.040
Work on that.

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.290
And one tip that I would give
is make sure that you have a

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.920
one-hour alarm right
before the demo.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.390
At that point it's a
real code freeze.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:10.020
You are not touching
that code base.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.050
At that point you need to
rehearse your demo, make sure

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.980
that your projector is hooked
up properly, so that you're

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:17.480
ready for showtime.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.040
Then you can get on stage, show
that one feature, and

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.350
dazzle the crowd.

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:26.990
So if I may summarize the whole
thing in just one single

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.350
word, it's demo.

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:31.600
The whole day, think about what
you're going to demo,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.550
focus on that, work backwards,
and you will win.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.800
Thank you very much.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.310
MALE SPEAKER 2: What do you
think of when I say the word

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.060
chaos and chaos theory?

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.530
Is it a fantastic pickup
line for a scientist?

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.500
Maybe how crazy and complex
the weather is.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.860
But here's the thing, every
single one of you already

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.720
knows about chaos theory.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.740
Think for a moment about if
you were a quarter second

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.970
early or late to some critical
moment in your life.

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.320
How radically different
the world would be.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.330
That idea's been around science
fiction, been around

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.430
books, but how did it
really come to be

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:19.840
in terms of a science?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.150
Well it starts with this
fundamental question back in

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.620
the early 1800s.

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.400
Is Jupiter going to go careening
off into the moon?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.470
Are we going to have the
sun go crazy on us?

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.650
Or the moon crash
into the Earth?

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:36.950
It was such a critical problem
that King Oscar II for his

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.260
60th birthday commissioned
the first Oscar.

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.980
And in that prize, he invited
all the mathematicians and

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.460
physicists to test out their
theories and ideas.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.960
And 12 entered and three years
later one of them had a

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.770
magnificent 150 pages of
equations so they said, wow

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.010
it's so full equations,
you win.

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:58.950
And the biggest part of it was
he didn't solve the problem.

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:01.180
He said, well let me take the
Sun, the Earth, and the Moon

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.390
and see what happens.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.320
But then a graduate student
came along.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.180
And as the graduate student is
looking at it there's this

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:11.400
problem and they realize that
with the math this crazy stuff

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.860
could happen.

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:15.630
It was almost as if there was
chaotic trajectories.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:19.100
And the problem would remain
this way for nearly 100 years

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:21.140
until Ed Lorenz would
come along.

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:23.080
And he was working on
atmospheric models and he put

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.560
these models into one of the
first computers and put in

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.730
something like 3.17825 as one
of the starting conditions.

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:31.415
And one day he decided he wanted
to get a coffee and

00:08:31.415 --> 00:08:34.090
didn't want to enter that
so he put in 3.12.

00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.880
And then when he looked at the
results it was the same for a

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.140
little while and then wildly,
wildly different.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.295
So he took apart the computer,
tried to figure out what the

00:08:42.295 --> 00:08:44.380
heck was wrong, see if there's
any real bugs or roaches

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.830
inside there, put it
back together,

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.830
the same thing happened.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:51.000
And what he realized is that
the world with weather is

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.490
incredibly interconnected.

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.170
And this idea that a butterfly
flapping its wings in one part

00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:58.030
of the world could cause
a tornado on the

00:08:58.030 --> 00:08:59.970
other side was born.

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:02.340
And the problem, once again,
would stay this way because

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.960
nobody knew what
to do with it.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.140
And it would stay this way for
10 years until Jim Yorke would

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.720
come along.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.130
And Jim had two fantastic
things going for him.

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:12.260
The first is he titled his paper
"Period Three Implies

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:14.390
Chaos," thereby naming
the field.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:18.270
The second is this new type of
device that could sit on top

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:19.490
of your desktop.

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:20.980
This, the personal computer.

00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:23.450
Because now, for the very first
time, he could put in

00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:26.390
those same equations Poincare
was working on, he could see

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:29.710
the behavior that Lorenz
was also seeing.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:33.100
All this rich behavior, the
fractals, all that stuff that

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:34.470
was coming about.

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:36.830
And in fact, as they were
starting to dig into it they

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:39.610
realized that there were very,
very simple systems that would

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:40.400
come about.

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.870
Not like this table, but what's
underneath the table.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.330
And this thing, which is this
very simple device which is

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.380
one of the first original ones
to describe chaos theory.

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.900
And you realize that you can
get incredibly complex

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.480
behavior out of such a very
simple, elementary system.

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.570
And as they realized and dug
into this it was all over the

00:09:57.570 --> 00:09:59.930
place, all over the world
in math, weather.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:00.750
All over things.

00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:03.540
But as you get to this there
came a question.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.810
Well, great, what are we
supposed to do with it?

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.560
How do we actually
think about it?

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.040
And so a remarkable experiment
happened in 1978.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.300
A satellite was launched
on ISEE 3.

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.750
And it had all these whiz-bang
sensors and all this great

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.890
stuff on it.

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.850
But after a few years it was
running into a problem.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:24.270
It had only two spray cans
worth of propellant left.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.510
But the guy said, hey you know
what, we got this comet coming

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.360
at us, we've got all the right
sensors, we don't have time to

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.600
build a new satellite.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:30.920
Why don't we try to
fly this through?

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:33.020
And the guy said, uh,
two spray cans.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.170
That's all we got.

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.600
But wait, this is the same
problem Poincare did.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.980
A big planet, a small planet,
and a tiny one.

00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:43.630
So 37 controlled burns later
of spray paint, five lunar

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:46.900
fly-bys, getting as close as 80
miles to the surface of the

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:49.380
moon, they were able to not
fly through one comet but

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.550
through two comets using
controlled chaos.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.472
Let's get back to the weather.

00:10:54.472 --> 00:10:55.710
What can we say about chaos?

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.420
If we know that there's small
changes that lead to big

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:01.280
changes why run one
weather model?

00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.160
We should run lots of
weather models.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:05.310
In fact, that's what
we do today.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.420
We run an ensemble of them and
where the forecasts line up,

00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.680
we have a good forecast.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.470
Where they don't line up,
we have a bad forecast.

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.780
For the first time this was
used in the early '80s to

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.140
predict one of the
major snowstorms

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:19.510
over the Eastern seaboard.

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:23.050
And what you can see over here
is all that kind of spaghetti

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.600
lining up over the East coast.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.040
But you'll notice over
the Atlantic you've

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.720
got horrible forecasts.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.620
And so when you listen to
weather these days and you

00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:32.620
hear this and they say, well
we're going to watch this,

00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.910
this is actually what
they're looking at.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:38.170
And if I have to leave you with
one thing, what chaos

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:40.890
tells us is the world is
incredibly interconnected and

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:44.410
that interconnectedness is
really what drives the world

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:47.450
and, from a sci-fi angle to
now what you take as a

00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:50.630
science, is something that
lives in everyday life.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.880
Thank you.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:00.970
CHRIS VEIN: And now,
as they say, for

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.680
something completely different.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.290
I am Chris Vein, I'm the Deputy
United States Chief

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.490
Technology Officer and I'm here
to talk to you about open

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:09.740
innovation.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:12.800
Open innovation.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.680
What we're really talking about
is how we're opening up

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.780
government, making it more
participative, collaborative,

00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:21.100
and enabling folks like you
to help us solve problems.

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:24.370
I think that I have the coolest
job in Washington

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:26.980
because I get to travel around
the country, if not around the

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:29.290
world, really looking at
what's happening in an

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.150
innovation space, in the private
sector, public sector,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.200
and extract kind of the secret
sauce, the stuff that makes it

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.440
all worthwhile.

00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:39.070
Actually, he's got the
coolest job in

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.900
Washington, especially today.

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.710
But let me tell you, that the
president understands that the

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.840
problems we face are
just too great.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.870
We don't have time
to use the usual

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:50.120
ways of solving problems.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.740
We have to innovate, we have
to use technology.

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:54.270
Let me tell you about
three problems.

00:12:54.270 --> 00:12:56.790
The first is that the population
of the United

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:02.370
States and the world
is approaching 9.3

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:06.060
billion people in 2050.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:10.150
And May 23, 2007, that's
when the world became

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:11.950
the majority urban.

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.980
And in the next two decades
we're going to be

00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.920
even 2/3 to 3/4 urban.

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.710
The last stat that I've
got for you is 12%.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:24.680
That's the arable land left in
the planet that we can use to

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:25.840
plant crops.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.060
So what this all means is that
we have to double down, we

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:31.410
have to use technology, and
figure out how we're going to

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.760
make our current land more
efficient in order to feed all

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.660
those people.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.140
That's why the president says,
and he said this to me many

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:42.700
times, we need to think about
how technology can be used to

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.770
solve these problems and we need
to think about that every

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:47.940
second of every day in
order to do that.

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:53.480
Blank screen.

00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:57.650
There we go.

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:59.800
When I was Chief Information
Officer for the city and

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.440
county of San Francisco, I often
worked on this problem

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.260
of, how do we reduce
bureaucratic barriers?

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:07.910
What could happen if government
actually got out of

00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:11.650
the way and allowed citizens and
hackers and everybody to

00:14:11.650 --> 00:14:13.710
really work on solving
problems?

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:16.320
This is what we've done with the
Data.gov platform and I'm

00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.330
going to be talking about
data from now on.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.700
We've actually open sourced the
Data.gov platform and made

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.130
it worldwide in its
applicability.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:27.990
Imagine if we had data from
cities and counties and states

00:14:27.990 --> 00:14:31.110
and tribes and governments
around the world all on the

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:32.380
same platform.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.040
Imagine what we could do with
that data, the problems that

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.030
we could solve.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:39.010
And it's not something that
we haven't tried before.

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:43.530
Decades ago, NOAA released all
of the data around weather and

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:45.610
the weather industry
was created.

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:47.960
The defense department did the
same thing with GPS and now

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.690
we've got GPS everywhere.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.440
That all came from
the government.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.060
So let me tell you about four
current examples of what we're

00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.840
doing with Blue Button.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:58.940
We are allowing vets to download
their personal health

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:01.960
care record and take that
personal health care record

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.790
wherever they go.

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.170
And when it comes to energy,
we're doing the same thing but

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:07.900
we're working with the
private sector.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.470
And we're getting energy
companies to let citizens

00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:13.590
download their personal data so
that they can make better

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.220
purchasing decisions.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.510
When it comes to education, a
big topic these days, we're

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.650
doing the same thing.

00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:23.700
We're allowing folks to
start downloading

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.410
their financial data.

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.100
We're looking at releasing all
of the new tools around

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:34.160
learning registries and all of
the educational data to help

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.070
citizens make better-informed
decisions.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.400
The last example I want to
talk about is safety.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.290
Tens of thousands of
people die every

00:15:42.290 --> 00:15:43.570
year in traffic accidents.

00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.090
Imagine, if we could get the
data out of every vehicle

00:15:47.090 --> 00:15:49.740
that's involved in every one of
those traffic accidents and

00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:52.130
extract it, what we could do.

00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:54.860
It's a model that's working and
what I want to tell you is

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.220
what we're doing is we're
taking groups of people,

00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.870
bringing them to Washington,
we're focusing on solving

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.250
problems in 90 days, and we're
releasing the solutions.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:05.015
It's that minimum viable
product that

00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:06.560
Eric Ries talks about.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.740
And one of the ways that we've
actually put this on steroids

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:14.140
is to develop the Presidential
Innovation Fellows Program

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:17.460
where we're actually letting
people sign up to come to

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:19.880
Washington and help
us work and solve

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.250
some of these problems.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.200
But we know that that's
not enough.

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:26.090
We know that we need to make
some structural changes in how

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.580
the federal government works.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.900
We need to create government
as a platform.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.380
We need to make everything API
and we need to make our data

00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.770
automatically released.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.180
So here's my pitch.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.050
My pitch is that we need you,
we're working with you, and

00:16:42.050 --> 00:16:45.870
we're creating opportunities for
you to work with us from

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:48.620
Washington to where
you sit every day.

00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:51.557
As we release all of our
projects, and our data, and

00:16:51.557 --> 00:16:54.080
our APIs, we ask
you to help us.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.830
Come work with us and create
the next generation of

00:16:56.830 --> 00:16:57.410
government.

00:16:57.410 --> 00:16:58.660
Thank you.

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:06.975
JOHN VLACHOYIANNIS:

00:17:06.975 --> 00:17:08.260
[SPEAKING GREEK], San Francisco?

00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:09.630
I'm John, I'm from Greece.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:13.510
And I'm going to talk to you
about music, data and how

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.690
actually we geeks
are rockstars.

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:17.834
You have less than five seconds,
I believe, to follow

00:17:17.834 --> 00:17:18.619
my Twitter.

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:19.900
Do it right now.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:23.859
So we don't really know
the origins of music.

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:27.430
Scientists believe that we
started creating music the

00:17:27.430 --> 00:17:30.170
moment we started to
imitate nature.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:32.440
I believe that we actually
haven't created any music if

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:34.340
you're listening to
Justin Bieber.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.920
But whatever.

00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.190
So as I said previously
I'm from Greece.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:45.680
So we Greeks, I won't say that
we created music, but where

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.660
music comes from, muses.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.000
Muse is actually the word
for Goddesses of art, of

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.420
inspiration, everything.

00:17:52.420 --> 00:17:55.520
So we Greeks tried to
correlate music and

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.490
mathematics a long time ago.

00:17:57.490 --> 00:17:58.930
This guy Pythagoras, let
me tell you a little

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:00.000
bit about this guy.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.770
This guy was so obsessed
with fractions.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:05.150
So one time he was passing
through an anvil store.

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:09.400
He realized that the size of the
anvil determines how the

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.670
sound actually--

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.000
you can hear the sound.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.080
And that's how the diatonic
scale, the twelve notes we

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.120
have today were created.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.970
Now moving a little bit forward
in time, we realized

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.750
that actually tones, music
tones, are actually sound

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.170
waves and we can manipulate
their attitude and tones and

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:27.910
everything.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:30.580
So of course, geeks
took control.

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.000
And realized that we can create
programs where we can

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.550
manipulate sounds on the fly,
creating electronic music and

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.470
everything and interesting
stuff.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.870
Actually if you guys were here
at Google I/O last year,

00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:44.755
SexyVisuals, which were
from Pixar, Lucas

00:18:44.755 --> 00:18:46.290
Arts, Apple, and Google--

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:48.690
there were some guys that were
creating music, live

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.520
programming music on the fly.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:54.390
Yeah and audio and vision was
pretty, pretty, pretty good.

00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:55.980
You should check them out.

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.590
So I'll tell you about
my personal epiphany.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:01.110
My personal epiphany came the
moment I realized that

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:04.090
actually music is nothing
more than data.

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.180
And code is data so data is
music and all this stuff.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.500
So we started and implemented,
like a

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.400
proper geek, a language.

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:15.960
A programming language where it
enables you to write music

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.940
in real time.

00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:20.020
The language called MAD, it's
based on LISP and it's using

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:20.940
the processing framework.

00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:23.350
It's the best framework
for audio and visual.

00:19:23.350 --> 00:19:25.860
So combining all this we'll
have some time.

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:27.710
So here's the specification.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.530
We just play a pattern and
the pattern is a kick.

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.760
So when you execute this
one you have [THUMP].

00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:38.920
So by executing this, the kick
is data but it also is music.

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.170
Doesn't sound so much
right now, but

00:19:43.170 --> 00:19:44.530
give me a couple seconds.

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:47.450
So now we are adding kick,
high hat, and tom.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:49.010
So if we play this pattern,
you have it

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.260
[MAKING DRUM SOUNDS].

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.210
All together, don't be afraid.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:55.070
Come on, come on guys.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.200
So let's try something
more difficult.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.240
Now let's say that we would
define a pattern that's

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.060
actually musical note.

00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:06.890
The first example plays
the [SINGING].

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:07.740
A pretty easy scale.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.740
But if we apply data
transformation, the reverse,

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.590
we get the [SINGING].

00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:16.400
And of course we can start with
writing some interesting

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.700
cues like the [SINGING].

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:21.540
This is the Tron soundtrack.

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.540
And it's pretty easy to--

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.880
okay, it's not that easy.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:27.890
But you can see that actually
music is data.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:31.500
And of course, of course, if
you are fans of dubstep you

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.150
can apply these functions and
you have the [MAKING SOUNDS]

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.830
and all this strange
stuff that dubstep

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.230
is all about today.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.230
But imagine, music
is actually data.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:43.790
So when I released the language,
a guy came and told

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:45.430
me, okay, but can you Bach?

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.570
I told him, come on man,
I'm just a geek, I

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:49.450
can't do that stuff.

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.430
So this guy went a little
bit crazy so he started

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:56.410
implementing all this in my
programming language.

00:20:56.410 --> 00:20:58.410
And this is exactly
the same thing.

00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:00.530
And this is the right hand,
he's also written the left

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:03.540
hand, and he's playing all of
them in unison and all of this

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:04.250
crazy stuff.

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:08.220
And once in a while, he emails
me videos of him playing Bach

00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.380
and he's in his house.

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.540
He's a crazy guy.

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:14.140
So actually data is
music, right.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.170
So what if I get the latest
tweets, I convert them to

00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:18.640
notes, and play them?

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.100
Guys, you won't believe that.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:22.330
This actually makes sense.

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:24.690
If you go [INAUDIBLE] on this
on the site, on MAD's site,

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:27.440
you'll see in a couple of
slides, actually makes sense.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:28.630
It's unbelievable.

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.950
So I was using processing
framework, I told you a couple

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:32.960
of minutes ago.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:34.690
You could use Overtones,
another framework

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.850
again built on LISP.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.650
And of course you could use
ClojureScript so you can run

00:21:38.650 --> 00:21:40.400
everything on your browser.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.480
You could create this music
on your browser.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.680
So let's disrupt, a
little bit, music.

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.790
So imagine that all albums
are Github, right.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:50.390
So you could clone them, fork
them, make modifications in

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:51.170
the [? bag. ?]

00:21:51.170 --> 00:21:54.800
And also, you have revisions,
you could share music as code.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:56.450
That disrupts everything.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:58.220
So we're building a band.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:00.170
Of course we're geeks, we wanna
be rock stars, so we're

00:22:00.170 --> 00:22:01.010
building a band.

00:22:01.010 --> 00:22:06.000
If you're Skrillex or someone
else, please join us at--

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.040
again my Twitter, follow
it right now guys.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.340
And let's rock.

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:10.280
Thank you, everybody.

00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.530
Have fun.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:23.190
THOMAS PARK: We live in a
world full of questions.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.910
Deep, philosophical questions
like if I bike to work

00:22:25.910 --> 00:22:28.250
tomorrow, will it rain
on me on my way home?

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:30.770
What's GOOG's sticker price
going to be next week?

00:22:30.770 --> 00:22:33.180
And that cute brunette over
there, will she be into you

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.800
given the information on
your public profiles?

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.510
So I'm Thomas Park, I
work for Google in

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.580
Seattle on cloud computing.

00:22:39.580 --> 00:22:41.640
Before that I worked at a
bunch of other places.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.520
And tonight we're going to
talk about solving these

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.570
problems using technology.

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.570
But before that, I'd like to
make sure that we're all on

00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:50.330
the same page with regards
to analytical modeling.

00:22:50.330 --> 00:22:52.500
So quick overview, you ready?

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.650
Here we've got a
bunch of data.

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.560
It's two data classes,
red and blue.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.910
If we want to build a model
describing this data, we'll

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:01.140
take about 70% of it, call it
the training set, draw a line

00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:03.880
along the geometric median such
that blue's on one side,

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.670
red's on the side
for most part.

00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:08.860
Then we can evaluate the
performance of this model by

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.940
putting the data points in the
rest of the data set through

00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:14.270
the model and comparing
the red-blue result

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:16.620
with the known result.

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.060
Pretty simple.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:23.420
So now that we know all about
analytical modeling, phew,

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.880
let's talk about machine
learning.

00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.970
So this is the application of
algorithms to find interesting

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:29.780
patterns in groups and data,.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:33.310
Such as, for example, if we look
at the shape, color, and

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:35.620
texture of these mushrooms,
will they be delicious,

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:38.930
poisonous, or make me
see funny colors?

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:40.230
So let's turn up the
heat a little bit.

00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:42.040
Let's say that Google
is launching dating

00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:42.810
functionality.

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.050
We're going to use the
information in your G+ profile

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.940
to find interesting people
for you to meet.

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.850
Now there's a clear vector
for abuse here.

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.790
You can create a lot of
profiles with a lot of

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.710
interests and get a
lot of hookups.

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:57.810
So maybe the G+ team wants to
use machine learning to detect

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:00.610
whether or not a user creating
an account is a bot.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:02.650
We can use variables
like this.

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:04.820
Now one of the interesting
things about machine learning

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.660
is that it still requires
human intuition.

00:24:07.660 --> 00:24:10.050
It's easy for you and I look at
these and see that one of

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.310
these is not a very plausible
email address.

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.580
So we need to extract
features from these.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:18.510
Such as, do Google hit results
exist from the name, and are

00:24:18.510 --> 00:24:21.040
the letter sequences possible?

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.550
So now I want to talk to
you about something

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.550
called random forest.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:27.470
Please raise your hand if you're
familiar with these.

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.890
Now it's a pretty powerful
technique, it's been around

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.050
for about 15, 20 years but
almost nobody's heard of it.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:33.580
So I'll spend the
rest of my talk

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.730
focusing on random forest.

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:37.600
What are these in a nutshell?

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.220
The idea is that instead of
building a really great model,

00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:42.520
we're going to build a large
number of crappy models kind

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.210
of like a red-blue
[? pacifier. ?]

00:24:44.210 --> 00:24:47.090
We'll let them vote and then
take the aggregate or the

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:49.370
average across all the models
and then that'll give us

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.030
actually pretty good behavior.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:53.720
So how does this look
in practice?

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.310
We're going to use a large
number of variables, ideally

00:24:56.310 --> 00:25:00.120
much more than what I have here,
and build decision trees

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.580
that fit this model exactly.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:05.290
Each of the decision trees is
going to use a small random

00:25:05.290 --> 00:25:06.430
subset of the data.

00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:07.820
That's the random in
random forest.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.520
Why is this interesting?

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.350
So what we'll see is that we're
building models that

00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:16.340
work OK for a lot of data but
in some cases, since we're

00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:18.470
building these models from
reserve data, we'll have

00:25:18.470 --> 00:25:20.420
variables that are very
predictive and so they work

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:21.800
really, really well.

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:24.900
Except for when our users'
script decides to stop

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:28.630
advertising it's user agent
as libwww-perl.

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.860
So now the performance in
model one has tanked.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.490
But in an ideal situation, we'd
have enough models that

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:37.050
still perform well that will
get good overall results.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:39.570
Now in a real world situation
we'd be using a very large

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:41.720
number of these trees, hundreds
more, each using

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.560
maybe five to ten variables.

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:46.430
It's interesting to note also
that these trees are totally

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.980
independent.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.740
We can grow them and evaluate
them in parallel.

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.990
Not all machine learning
algorithms can do this.

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:53.130
That's cool.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:55.390
Now let's talk a little bit
more about variables.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.000
Most of these require human
intuition, like I said.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.770
But random forest will help
us out there as well.

00:26:00.770 --> 00:26:03.750
You also notice that we're not
using variables with a huge

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.150
value space like IP
address, raw IP.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.980
There's just too many values
to it, too much noise.

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:11.700
So in a situation like this we
can use something called

00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:15.610
binning, where we separate the
data into categories that make

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.090
more sense.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:20.090
If you guys have answered
surveys that ask your age

00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:23.550
it'll often say under 18,
18 to 24, et cetera.

00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:26.270
Now when we're feeding data to
the trees, one of the cool

00:26:26.270 --> 00:26:29.370
things about the random forest
algorithm is that it can

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:31.990
actually tell us what variables
are predictive.

00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:34.900
So we can feed it a lot of
data without necessarily

00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:39.190
caring too much about whether
or not it's a good variable.

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:42.160
So we've been talking mostly
about using random forest as a

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.780
classifier, a binary
classifier.

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.290
Is bot, is not bot.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:47.080
But it can also be
used to recognize

00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.600
interesting groups of data.

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.170
Which in our dating case
might be interesting

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:52.210
people for you to meet.

00:26:52.210 --> 00:26:54.450
So 15 seconds less, how
does this work?

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.970
When we are running data through
our models, we're

00:26:56.970 --> 00:26:58.640
going to see what terminal
node, what leaf

00:26:58.640 --> 00:26:59.670
node it winds up in.

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.180
All of the data goes through
all of the trees, so we can

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.970
keep track of how often two
data points wind up in the

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.300
same terminal state.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:08.780
And that'll tell us how
similar the data is.

00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:10.920
So hopefully I've piqued your
interest about machine

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.060
learning and random
forest there.

00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:15.140
I'd just like to thank Ignite
for bringing me on to talk.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.740
And thank you to all the artists
who've put your photos

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:19.960
out there under Creative
Commons.

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.210
Thank you.

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:32.120
CHRISTOPHER MARKS: It was late
on a summer night as I sat

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:35.350
typing "Your offer is too low,"
into Google Translate to

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.010
sell my 10 gallon hat with the
scorching flames particle

00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:41.130
effect to a Japanese man
that I wondered,

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:43.010
how did I get here?

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:44.600
This is my story.

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.430
When I was a noob, my friend Joe
told me to kill cows and

00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.960
lumber so I could train my
combat and sell the hides for

00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.850
100 GP each at the local bank.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:53.780
I thought I was going to be the

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.610
richest player in RuneScape.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.460
I set off to collect
10 million of them.

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.690
But when I got to the bank I saw
someone was selling them

00:28:01.690 --> 00:28:03.660
there for 50 GP each.

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:06.790
At first I thought I was going
to lose all of my profit as I

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:08.020
had been undercut.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.690
But then I realized that I could
buy his hides for 50 GP

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.530
each and then sell them
for 100 GP each and

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:15.960
make a quick profit.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:19.440
And this was incredible to
10-year-old me because I

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.370
realized that I could make
money by not actually

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.890
gathering materials but
by simply buying

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:27.170
low and selling high.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:30.780
And this is the what got
me into trading.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:34.800
Later on I was on a quest and
I noticed an NPC that sold

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.580
dragon daggers for 17k each
which I could poison for 1k

00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:43.870
each and then hop to a PVP world
and sell for 55k each.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:46.950
And this was an incredible
profit for little effort.

00:28:46.950 --> 00:28:50.350
RuneScape implemented a Grand
Exchange which allowed players

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:53.510
to not just shout outside of
banks but go to a building and

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:56.190
sell their items and have trades
match up automatically.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:57.660
And have prices change
according

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.910
to supply and demand.

00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:03.060
And with this came Grand
Exchange price graphs, which I

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:06.500
analyzed to see that when items
were at their lower

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.760
price I would buy them up
and cause the price to

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:11.085
artificially rise to turn
a quick profit.

00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:17.220
And this idea eventually led to
clan merchanting which was

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:20.810
essentially the same thing but
involved a larger group of

00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:22.520
people to buy more items.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.540
However be higher-up members of
the clan would usually sell

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:28.330
their items before the other
people and would cause people

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:31.000
to lose most of their profits.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.610
Now RuneScape imposed a trade
limit which was a maximum of

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:37.820
60k in order to stop scamming
and real-world trading.

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.540
But to get around this traders
would add junk items, which

00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:44.640
had a market price value but
no actual real value, to

00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:47.080
change the price of the items.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.600
Flipping is essentially over
bidding on an item and then

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.080
under bidding on an item
to find its price.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.650
Then you buy the item for one
GP over the lower bound and

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:58.900
then sell it for one GP under
the higher bound so you can

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.060
undercut everybody and
make a quick profit.

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.880
Now there are two main types of
items in RuneScape, there's

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.580
useful and there's cosmetic.

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:09.500
However of course there are
higher-level armors which cost

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.290
a lot of money because they are
useful, so they fall into

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.000
that category.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.520
But there are a set of items
which are the most important

00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:20.420
cosmetic items because
they're discontinued.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.450
And since they aren't going to
be released into the game

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.090
anymore they're only going to
rise in the long term even if

00:30:26.090 --> 00:30:27.730
they drop in the short term.

00:30:27.730 --> 00:30:30.180
As well as players getting
enough money to buy them,

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.140
increasing the demand
of the item.

00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.040
Now there are items like this
that are not only in RuneScape

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.800
but in Team Fortress 2.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.250
And the currency in RuneScape
is set in stone because they

00:30:39.250 --> 00:30:40.470
have gold coins.

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:44.230
But in Team Fortress 2 it's much
more based on arbitrage

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.060
which changes it quite a bit.

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.200
So in Team Fortress 2 there's
metal keys and buds which are

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.420
the primary currency.

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:56.315
Buds were a promotional item
released by Valve when Team

00:30:56.315 --> 00:30:59.200
Fortress 2 was released for Mac
and they are the preferred

00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:01.000
currency to be paid
in unusuals.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.770
And there are four main
ways to make money

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:04.180
when trading unusuals.

00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.550
The first is to buy buds for
$31, then sell them for 24

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:12.730
keys, then sell the keys for
$1.49 each and make $4.76 per

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.300
bud that you sell.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.730
And it may not seem like a lot
but it adds up pretty quickly.

00:31:17.730 --> 00:31:20.990
The second way is unusual
trading, which is what I did.

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.960
And it would take forever to
explain it but basically you

00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:29.770
buy the hats that have a good
effect and that have the good

00:31:29.770 --> 00:31:32.930
class as well as the specific
hats that people want.

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:36.250
But the main trick when dealing
with unusual trading

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:38.850
is to find people who actually
want the hats and

00:31:38.850 --> 00:31:40.060
to be nice to them.

00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:44.200
Because being an asshole loses
you 99% of your trades.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.070
The third way that people make
money is by idling, by setting

00:31:48.070 --> 00:31:50.570
up 10 or so accounts to collect
the five to seven

00:31:50.570 --> 00:31:53.070
items that Valve releases
per week.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.820
And they would use the items
they gather to sell them to

00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:58.700
get metal to buy the hats and
stuff that they wanted.

00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:01.670
And the fourth way that people
would make money, which is

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:05.090
obviously the most frowned upon,
is by finding people who

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.120
don't know what their
hats are worth.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:10.250
So it's essentially finding
someone and scanning them for

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:17.160
their hat which you can sell
for between $20 to $1,500.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.155
And recently Valve hired an
economist whose name is Yanis

00:32:20.155 --> 00:32:23.680
Varoufakis and he's been
analyzing the economy from a

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:26.300
real-life perspective by
looking at equilibrium.

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.930
And so far he has most
of it right but he's

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:30.160
still a bit of a noob.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.410
Thank you.

00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.060
DAVID WEEKLY: Hey everybody.

00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.300
I'm David Weekly.

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:48.080
A number of years ago I was 25
living in a city and looking

00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.110
for ways to throw
awesome parties.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:54.060
So I did what any reasonable
young gentleman would do and I

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.600
started finding some housemates
that I could go and

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.040
split a crazy mansion with
in Hillsborough.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.220
We decided to call it Super
Happy Fun House after the

00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:05.040
Happy Fun Ball from Saturday
Night Live.

00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.820
And we resolved to go and
throw crazy parties.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:11.570
So our very first party that
we had, we had about 150

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:15.320
people including a California
gubernatorial candidate who I

00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.310
briefly ended up dating
and a film crew.

00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:20.060
And so it was pretty clear we
were on to something, we

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:20.790
should do it again.

00:33:20.790 --> 00:33:23.490
So we started throwing these
parties once every six weeks.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:27.250
We had professional DJs, we had
two story high banners to

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.655
welcome people there, we
had in-ground hot tubs.

00:33:29.655 --> 00:33:30.780
It was a lot of fun.

00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.560
Two of my roommates worked at
IDO so we had all kinds of

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.620
custom built stuff.

00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.190
Like a freezer we custom
converted into a photobooth.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.960
That's Aaron Patzer
from Mint.com.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.740
We even went ahead and built a
custom dance cage that people

00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:46.830
would go and dance in.

00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:47.790
These parties were great.

00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:49.680
And they became very,
very popular.

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.600
So popular that by the time we
got to the ninth one of these

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.290
parties more than 400 people
showed up, they'd cordoned off

00:33:56.290 --> 00:33:58.490
the surrounding two blocks, they
had put the SWAT team on

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.360
high alert, and we
got into trouble.

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.340
So they cops said, you need to
stop throwing these parties.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.920
They wrote the landlord
a pretty angry letter.

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.260
So we were bummed out.

00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.139
We were thinking, these
parties were great.

00:34:09.139 --> 00:34:12.020
They actually contributed to
the fabric of society.

00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:14.480
People are getting to meet each
other and connect with

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.600
each other in meaningful
ways, right?

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.179
There were actually six couples
who met at these

00:34:19.179 --> 00:34:21.100
parties who ended up
getting married.

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:24.280
So what can we do to bring
people together that's not

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.920
going to get the cops
called on us again?

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:30.199
So one of my really nerdy
friends proposed something

00:34:30.199 --> 00:34:30.960
really interesting.

00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:33.969
He had been part of a LAN party
scene down in Los Gatos

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:36.190
and he suggested that we do
something that's like a LAN

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:37.850
party but it's productive
instead.

00:34:37.850 --> 00:34:39.219
It's LANing plus Deving.

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:41.510
So it's a party, a LAN party,
and its productive.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:43.630
So we'd have beer and
Red Bull and fast

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:44.659
internet and all that.

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:49.360
So we had the very first
SuperHappyDevHouse in mid 2005

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:52.900
and we got about 15 people to go
and show up between 7:00 PM

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.290
and 7:00 AM and it was
a tremendous success.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.190
I ended up coding the first
version of PBwiki, which ended

00:34:59.190 --> 00:35:01.440
up becoming a real company,
between 1:00

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.230
and 8:00 in the morning.

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.950
And so we said let's do this
every six weeks and we did.

00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:06.920
And it got bigger and bigger
and bigger just like Super

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:09.700
Happy Fun House did and by the
time we had done nine of them

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.940
at my house my roommates got
really sick of a couple

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.850
hundred nerds going in
taking over the house

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.050
all day on a Saturday.

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:19.600
So we started rotating where
we had them and then by the

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.260
time we got to the 30th DevHouse
at Sun's Executive

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:23.960
Briefing Center, which is
now Facebook's global

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.160
headquarters, we had people
overflowing this facility.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.830
And I said, you know what
I would hate to do at

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:29.740
the end of the night?

00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:31.470
I would hate to go and
kick you all out.

00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:33.100
But I'm going to need to,
because otherwise Sun security

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.150
is going to get mad at me.

00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:36.120
So what if there was a
place where I didn't

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:36.900
need to kick you out?

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.300
We could call it Hacker Dojo.

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.140
And this could be a place that
was open 24/7 for you to build

00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.350
whatever the hell you want to.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.260
You could wake up at 3:00 in
the morning and be like, I

00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:46.830
want to go and build
something cool.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:49.840
We'd have fast internet and
tables and chairs and not a

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:50.830
whole lot else more.

00:35:50.830 --> 00:35:54.270
So after about six months of
figuring it out and getting an

00:35:54.270 --> 00:35:57.290
initial membership base we
opened Hacker Dojo at 140A

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:58.750
South Whisman in
Mountain View.

00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:59.820
I encourage you to come visit.

00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:01.650
It's open 24/7.

00:36:01.650 --> 00:36:03.000
We started getting
more and more

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.570
membership at $100 a month.

00:36:04.570 --> 00:36:06.490
We were able to very quickly
make ends meet.

00:36:06.490 --> 00:36:09.630
We've leased out more and more
parts of the building until

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.250
now today we're the largest
hacker space in the world.

00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:14.080
We've rented out the entire
building, some

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.410
13,000 square feet.

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:18.690
There are some minor
difficulties we're still

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.795
undergoing with the city in
terms of a quarter million

00:36:20.795 --> 00:36:25.000
dollars of renovations that we
need to make to fire safety

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.582
and all that.

00:36:26.582 --> 00:36:28.840
So your contribution would
be appreciated.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.550
But come on by, drop on by.

00:36:30.550 --> 00:36:33.100
Pinterest was actually started
at Hacker Dojo.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.480
Dozens of companies have
started there.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.370
It's just a tremendous
community resource.

00:36:37.370 --> 00:36:38.700
What about SuperHappyDevHouse?

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.410
We recently celebrated the
50th SuperHappyDevHouse.

00:36:41.410 --> 00:36:43.780
A Super Happy block party
was advertised by the

00:36:43.780 --> 00:36:44.910
mayor of Palo Alto.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:47.450
About 2,000 people showed up.

00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:50.340
We cordoned off a whole
block of Palo Alto.

00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:53.540
It was tremendous just to see
those many people building.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:55.270
DevHouse has also
been replicated

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:56.310
all around the planet.

00:36:56.310 --> 00:36:58.060
I just came back from Singapore
where they were

00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.960
doing one of their
DevHouses there.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:02.720
They're have been dozens of
DevHouses down in Mexico.

00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.000
They're pretty easy to throw.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.160
You just get a bunch of people
together and you hack all

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:06.930
night long.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:08.680
It doesn't have to have a
winner, doesn't have to be a

00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:09.670
competition.

00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:12.460
DevHouse has also inspired other
DevHouse-like events,

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:14.700
things like BarCamp that's been
all around the world.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:16.950
Corporate hackathons
like Facebook.

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:19.180
And here we see a bunch of kids

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.360
going and doing a hackathon.

00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.510
Hack the Future is what
that's called.

00:37:23.510 --> 00:37:26.870
So getting kids involved in
coding and production.

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:28.200
These things are really
important.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.250
Because they inspire folks,
they get folks started.

00:37:30.250 --> 00:37:33.420
Woz actually was first
introduced to a computer at a

00:37:33.420 --> 00:37:35.830
very early hackathon some 30
years ago at the Homebrew

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.150
Computer Club.

00:37:37.150 --> 00:37:40.340
That's where he got introduced
to his first computer.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:41.760
So you can do this.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.350
Go build a hackathon.

00:37:43.350 --> 00:37:45.130
Get a dozen people
together in your

00:37:45.130 --> 00:37:47.960
room and go copy DevHouse.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.210
Thank you.

00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:58.640
RICHARD WARP: Good evening.

00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.230
Everybody here, I'm sure,
has a question

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:03.340
that they dread answering.

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:05.550
Whether it's at a conference
or a party or a friend's

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:09.030
wedding, it comes at you from
nowhere and there's nothing

00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.840
you can do about it.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.760
So for me that question
is, what do you do?

00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:16.200
So the conversation would
go something like this.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.170
What you do?

00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:18.130
I'm a composer.

00:38:18.130 --> 00:38:20.280
Oh, what do you play?

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.520
I don't really play
an instrument.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.200
OK so what kind of
songs you write?

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:26.040
Well I don't really
write songs.

00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:28.170
OK so what kind of music
do yo write then?

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:31.160
Well I'm not sure I'd really
call it music.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.330
Interesting.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.500
I'm just going to go
and get a drink.

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:37.070
So the conversation doesn't
always have to go like that

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.800
but generally speaking, if you
want to have a nice quiet time

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.140
at a party, tell them you're
an avant-garde composer.

00:38:44.140 --> 00:38:47.530
So avant-garde composers have
historically had this image of

00:38:47.530 --> 00:38:50.720
themselves as being on the
leading edge of musical

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.830
frontiers and breaking
down barriers.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:55.450
Sticking it to the man, all
this kind of thing.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:38:57.990
But audiences, at least these
days, have a sort of slightly

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:02.540
different idea of avant-garde
composers as definitely less

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.110
than heroic.

00:39:04.110 --> 00:39:06.170
And that's a shame because
there's a huge amount of

00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:09.620
really great experimental music
out there but the stigma

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:10.480
sort of still remains.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.870
So why is that?

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:14.520
Well if we rewind a couple
hundred years, if you want to

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:16.430
hear new music you'd
go to a concert.

00:39:16.430 --> 00:39:19.720
It was all about concerts, and
audiences, and premiers.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.370
But as soon as recording
technology came around-- and I

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:26.380
love recording technology,
by the way--

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:29.060
composers could then experiment
till the cows come

00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:30.670
home and there were studios and
they didn't have to show

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:31.790
it for an audience.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:34.810
So studios became like
laboratories.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:36.890
But the problem was that
composers thought they could

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:40.530
take that stuff out on the road
and it didn't go down so

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.240
well with public.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:45.530
So against that backdrop of
experimental music, I'm going

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:48.090
to share a few of my experiences
with you.

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.150
So I've been very interested,
the last couple of years, in

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:52.650
the relationship between
music and the brain.

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:55.370
So my wife's a neuroscientist,
my drinking buddy's a

00:39:55.370 --> 00:39:58.650
neuroscientist, there's just
brains all over the place.

00:39:58.650 --> 00:40:01.630
So I got to asking, well what
can we do with this?

00:40:01.630 --> 00:40:07.120
So I started working with the
EEG signal and neurofeedback

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.580
and started developing with some
neuroscientist friends

00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.580
what's called a BCMI, or Brain
Computer Music Interface.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.370
EEG is great.

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:19.170
It's cheap, it's non-invasive,
it looks cool.

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:24.090
And so we started working on
an installation that we got

00:40:24.090 --> 00:40:27.610
approached to do involving
the internet.

00:40:27.610 --> 00:40:31.490
And we came up with this
idea of redoing a

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:33.500
classic piece from 1965.

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.970
We called ours, Music for
Online Performer.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:39.210
So what we did was we streamed
the live brain signal, split

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:42.370
between the four frequency
bands, over the web via open

00:40:42.370 --> 00:40:46.310
sound control to the UK into a
concert space which was hooked

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:49.340
up to an Arduino interface that
controlled robots that

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:51.780
would play acoustic instruments
in real time.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:55.320
We also had a live stream chat
room going on where people

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.990
could log in, they
could comment.

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.540
We even took requests.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:00.280
It was like, more drum.

00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:02.380
OK, increase beta power.

00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:06.070
It was a complex dynamic
system which is kind of

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.710
multi-level with social
interaction and robots on the

00:41:09.710 --> 00:41:11.250
other side of the planet.

00:41:11.250 --> 00:41:13.260
So how did it sound?

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.050
Well I have to tell you, it
sounded pretty terrible.

00:41:17.050 --> 00:41:18.720
It really didn't sound
that good.

00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:21.090
And that wasn't the point.

00:41:21.090 --> 00:41:23.410
The point was that we wanted to
show that we could connect

00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:26.150
all this stuff together and
that it could work over an

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.040
hour long performance with
various different time zones.

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.520
But at the end of the day,
this was a music concert.

00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:34.700
And our robots ended up sounding
like that candy

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:37.500
making machine out of Charlie
and the Chocolate Factory.

00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:40.370
So it was great proof of concept
but as a piece of

00:41:40.370 --> 00:41:42.080
music maybe not so great.

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:45.000
So we as artists, I think,
want to get from proof of

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.790
concept to what I would
call proof of context.

00:41:47.790 --> 00:41:49.030
So what do I mean by that?

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.950
Basically that you as the
audience shouldn't have to

00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:53.130
bring the context
in which you.

00:41:53.130 --> 00:41:55.470
You shouldn't have to have read
a book on experimental

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:59.150
music in order to be able to
kind of appreciate the output.

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:02.170
So in our case, the context
was a quartet of robots.

00:42:02.170 --> 00:42:05.080
Now in a real quartet the
instrumentalists listen to

00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:08.310
each other and they kind of put
it all together and they

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:09.450
vibe off each other.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.810
So if we had just tweaked the
algorithm a little it so that

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:14.140
the signals were listening to
each other and not all playing

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:15.500
at the same time it would
have had a better

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.210
sort of musical context.

00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:19.100
So just to demonstrate the
power context little

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:20.580
bit, this is Bob.

00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.690
He's a theremin.

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:25.400
And he's two oscillators
heterodyning and you probably

00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.360
recognize the sound.

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.960
It's kind of this sort of
sci-fi, kind of annoying sound

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.265
after a while.

00:42:33.265 --> 00:42:36.900
But if we just tweak the
algorithm ever so slightly by

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:40.090
applying some musical rules
we can have a very

00:42:40.090 --> 00:42:42.480
different kind of sound.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.414
Bob has a lovely singing
voice now.

00:42:44.414 --> 00:42:46.270
At least to my Western ears.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:49.070
So that's what I would
call context.

00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:53.490
And in terms of what we're doing
to do contextual music

00:42:53.490 --> 00:42:57.140
in the future, we're working
on a project for next May

00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.390
which will take music
as emotion.

00:43:00.390 --> 00:43:05.110
And we're looking to output that
in a more contextual way.

00:43:05.110 --> 00:43:07.880
So next time you see me, you
ask me what I do, I'll

00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.740
hopefully be able to say, I'm
glad you asked me that, let's

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:11.190
get a drink.

00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:12.440
Thanks very much.

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:18.570
AMY JO KIM: Hi, I'm Amy
Jo Kim and I have a

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:20.440
confession to make.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:24.230
Although I design rating systems
for a living, I hate

00:43:24.230 --> 00:43:26.020
competing with other people.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.720
What I love is collaborative
gaming.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.190
I love working together to
create something bigger than

00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:33.560
we could do on our own.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.510
When I first started working in
the games industry gaming

00:43:36.510 --> 00:43:38.080
meant competition.

00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.860
Here's a textbook example, a
system where players engage in

00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:45.720
a conflict with rules and
a quantifiable outcome.

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:48.200
Well that certainly describes
some kind of games.

00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:50.040
Game theory can help
us with this.

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.050
It defines zero-sum games.

00:43:53.050 --> 00:43:54.860
Games where there's a
winner and a loser.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.940
We're opponents.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:59.550
These kind of games are what
most people think of when they

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:00.750
think of games.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:02.950
Good examples are any
war simulation.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:06.110
Chess, Go, Polo.

00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:09.490
Head to head battles,
rank-ordered competitions,

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:12.490
gambling, where you're playing
either against other players

00:44:12.490 --> 00:44:15.800
or against the house, these
are all zero-sum games.

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.320
What I found as I worked in the
games industry was that

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.150
the games I was working on and
loved didn't fall neatly into

00:44:22.150 --> 00:44:23.900
this definition.

00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.110
Ultima Online, The
Sims, Rock Band.

00:44:27.110 --> 00:44:29.770
All of them were structured
more around having fun

00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:33.880
together and not around
pummeling your opponents.

00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:36.450
So I tried to invent a different
definition and I

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:40.010
slowly realized what these were,
were non-zero-sum games.

00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:42.610
Games where rather than
opponents, we're partners.

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.200
We win together and
we lose together.

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:49.270
Some examples are double dutch
on the playground, Pictionary

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:54.620
and other party games, martial
arts like karate where you

00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:58.050
have social support for your
personal progress, any charity

00:44:58.050 --> 00:45:02.740
walk or event, these are
all non-zero-sum games.

00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:07.170
And the reason that you should
care about this is because the

00:45:07.170 --> 00:45:10.970
games industry is undergoing
massive disruption.

00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:14.220
And that's creating big
new opportunities for

00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:17.060
collaborative games and
services, particularly those

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.580
the target females.

00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.780
Three trends are driving this.

00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:23.940
The first trend is ubiquitous
connected devices.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:26.000
Games used to be played
on consoles.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.130
But the shift to smartphones
and tablets and mobile

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.470
computing has disrupted this.

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:33.260
That's where the
action is now.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:35.340
That's where people are looking
to play their games.

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:37.350
And that's where they're
spending more money.

00:45:37.350 --> 00:45:40.560
If you look at the overall games
industry shown here, the

00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:42.850
overall industry's growing
but at the bottom

00:45:42.850 --> 00:45:43.940
there that's consoles.

00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:45.700
Flat, it's even declining.

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:48.770
All the growth is coming
from mobile and online.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.560
It's not just living
room consoles

00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.040
that are being disrupted.

00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.300
Portable gaming.

00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:56.020
Here you have a slide that
basically shows portable

00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:00.450
gaming consoles' lunch being
eaten by iOS and Android.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:03.540
These mobile computing devices
are where people are more and

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:06.390
more playing games and they are
bringing in a different

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:07.940
and more mainstream audience.

00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.930
That's the second trend.

00:46:09.930 --> 00:46:12.800
Gamers are mainstream
and all-ages.

00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:14.610
Gaming has matured
into a mainstream

00:46:14.610 --> 00:46:16.040
entertainment medium.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.390
And the audience, which is
gender balanced and many ages,

00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:20.410
reflects that.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.110
Did you know, for instance,
that the fastest growing

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:26.820
demographic on Facebook
is women 55 plus?

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.660
And that 93% of kids 8 to 13
play games online and they

00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.550
cite Facebook as the main
place they do it.

00:46:33.550 --> 00:46:36.170
What's happening is people are
playing games and they're also

00:46:36.170 --> 00:46:38.330
getting on social media,
staying up to

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:39.820
date, sharing photos.

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:42.650
Which leads us to the third
disruptive trend.

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.210
Mutual entertainment.

00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:46.860
More and more people are engaged
in sharing content

00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.400
they and their friends
have created.

00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.930
That's sucking time away from
highly crafted experiences

00:46:51.930 --> 00:46:53.120
like traditional games.

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:55.600
Look at the hours people
are spending.

00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:57.380
Here what you see is
games are popular.

00:46:57.380 --> 00:47:01.540
Absolutely very popular, but
those hours are dwarfed by the

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.780
hours people are spending on
sites like Facebook, YouTube,

00:47:04.780 --> 00:47:06.860
and Twitter.

00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:09.490
If you look at Instagram, it's a
great example of this mutual

00:47:09.490 --> 00:47:10.730
entertainment trend.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.540
It's a photo sharing app.

00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:16.290
It's got this addictive loop
where you don't know what's

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.390
coming next and the likes and
comments from friends give you

00:47:20.390 --> 00:47:23.720
a pleasing but unpredictable
feedback loop.

00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:26.150
Draw Something is another
great example.

00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:29.560
You play with a friend, if you
draw the right word, they

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.930
guess it correctly
you both win.

00:47:31.930 --> 00:47:33.900
If they don't guess
it, you both lose.

00:47:33.900 --> 00:47:35.340
Its non-zero-sum.

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:37.670
Great example of mutual
entertainment.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:42.330
Now we know from recent studies
in happiness that a

00:47:42.330 --> 00:47:45.590
way to make yourself reliably
unhappier is to do social

00:47:45.590 --> 00:47:46.890
comparison.

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:49.060
It's also very motivating which
is why everyone wants a

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:51.440
leaderboard on their website
even when it's a

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:53.080
really stupid idea.

00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:57.540
We also know from happiness
studies that investing in

00:47:57.540 --> 00:47:59.400
social relationships
will reliably

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:00.970
lead you to be happier.

00:48:00.970 --> 00:48:03.190
Collaborative games
can deliver this.

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:08.890
It's a blue ocean market with
a big audience of gamers.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:13.180
Male and female, smartphones
in hand, waiting for games

00:48:13.180 --> 00:48:15.730
that they can play together that
will bring them together.

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:17.850
There's a Zulu word Ubuntu
that captures this

00:48:17.850 --> 00:48:19.410
non-zero-sum mentality.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:22.540
So the next time you're doing
any project, gamification,

00:48:22.540 --> 00:48:25.340
games, think collaboration
first.

00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:27.000
See where it takes you.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.250
Thank you.

00:48:38.801 --> 00:48:40.300
PETER NORVIG: Hi.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.530
I'm Peter Norvig.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:46.790
And I taught a class too 100,000
students at a time.

00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:50.070
I started this off because I
had written a traditional

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:53.270
textbook, a textbook on
artificial intelligence, and

00:48:53.270 --> 00:48:56.470
we were happy that my co-author
and I were able to

00:48:56.470 --> 00:49:00.770
capture over 90% of the
market for textbooks.

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:02.500
And so that was great.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:06.610
But the experience of writing
a textbook felt so limiting

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.570
because everything was stamped
on paper, or you can now get

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:13.670
an electronic version,
it's stamped on PDF.

00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:14.760
And it's static.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.890
And I knew people were
interacting with it in a

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:17.620
non-static way.

00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:20.590
They were underlining the
parts that they liked.

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.790
They were underlining in a
different color the parts that

00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:24.210
were confusing.

00:49:24.210 --> 00:49:26.290
They were bookmarking the
important places.

00:49:26.290 --> 00:49:28.790
That was all happening and I
wasn't capturing any of that

00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:30.320
so I want to get it back.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.390
Also there were complex things
like these charts that I

00:49:34.390 --> 00:49:36.750
created with data that I
manipulated with a program.

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:39.230
I learned a lot from that
manipulation and then all they

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:41.290
see is the static paper.

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:42.620
So I wanted to go beyond that.

00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:44.940
I wanted to give them that
hands-on experience.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:48.020
So my co-teacher, Sebastian
Thrun, and I said, we're going

00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:48.570
to do that.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:51.600
We're going to bring an
interactive experience, more

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.670
interactive than a textbook, and
we're going to bring it to

00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:54.320
more people.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.390
We're going to bring it to
thousands of people at a time.

00:49:57.390 --> 00:49:59.360
We didn't know how many
we were going to get.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:03.880
But it turned out the answer was
160,000 people signed up.

00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:08.260
By the end of the class of
80,000 were 7 day actives and

00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.030
23,000 finished all the
homework, did the equivalent

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.570
of a complete Stanford class.

00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.180
Now how do we deliver that?

00:50:15.180 --> 00:50:20.180
Well we learned from Benjamin
Bloom that one-on-one

00:50:20.180 --> 00:50:24.700
mentoring delivers teaching
that's two standard deviations

00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:26.290
above the norm.

00:50:26.290 --> 00:50:28.950
So you deliver a regular class
and compare that to

00:50:28.950 --> 00:50:31.350
one-on-one, you get two standard
deviations better.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:34.230
So we wanted to emulate that
one-on-one experience.

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:37.480
We saw Sal Khan had done a great
job with short videos.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.080
That short, 10 minute videos
are better than

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:41.220
an hour long one.

00:50:41.220 --> 00:50:42.460
We want to go even shorter.

00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:44.620
So we went one or two
minutes and then

00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:46.620
interspersed the questions.

00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:50.690
And it was ironic, I think,
that in trying to disrupt

00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:54.110
regular education we ended up
being more like a traditional

00:50:54.110 --> 00:50:56.010
education, a traditional
college.

00:50:56.010 --> 00:50:59.890
Because we found that what's
most important is the social

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.830
experience.

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:03.910
Interacting with each other,
not interacting with the

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.120
online components.

00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:07.990
And these are some of the social
networking sites that

00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:11.430
the students use and sort of
spontaneously developed.

00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:14.530
They went out and used all these
online tools so they can

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:16.120
interact with each other.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:19.260
The thing I learned the most
from was Teach For America.

00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:24.530
Where I learned about teachers
who did an amazing job taking

00:51:24.530 --> 00:51:27.510
students who were two years
behind grade level and in one

00:51:27.510 --> 00:51:30.870
year they brought them all
up to where they belong.

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:34.770
Now this was a shock to me
because I worked at Google for

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:39.090
many years and I thought what
my role was, is you take a

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:42.310
hard question like that and
you do all this tough

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:46.570
algorithmic stuff and then
you get the right answer.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:48.750
And I was proud that we can
do that kind of thing.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:51.370
But then I realized,
wait a minute.

00:51:51.370 --> 00:51:54.090
Getting the right answer,
that's the easy part.

00:51:54.090 --> 00:51:56.970
The hard part is asking
the questions.

00:51:56.970 --> 00:51:59.820
Getting people motivated so that
they want to engage and

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:01.330
ask questions.

00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:03.950
Now finally, this is a
college transcript.

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.780
It transmits about 48 bits
of information per year.

00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:09.110
This is an iPod.

00:52:09.110 --> 00:52:12.860
It translates about 192,000
bits per second.

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:14.300
So that's a trillion
times more.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:16.650
By cost, it's a quadrillion
times more.

00:52:16.650 --> 00:52:20.580
We can get more data by
interacting online.

00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.190
We can duplicate this one-on-one
experience, we can

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:27.480
bring it to 100,000 students,
but the real power is them

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:28.840
interacting with each other.

00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:32.230
These 100,000 squared pairs
of students working

00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:33.480
together in a community.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:43.280
MIKE TYKA: Hi.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.612
My name is Mike and I want
to talk to you about the

00:52:45.612 --> 00:52:47.950
invention of the wheel.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:50.360
As engineers, I think you will
appreciate that if you look to

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:53.340
nature, you're humbled
essentially.

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.510
Nature has come up with
helicopters and submarines and

00:52:57.510 --> 00:53:01.330
color screens and high speed
cameras and all that stuff.

00:53:01.330 --> 00:53:04.270
But one invention, to me,
that is typically

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:06.230
human is the wheel.

00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:09.170
We have used wheels since the
beginning of our civilization

00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:11.050
and they've really driven
a lot of the

00:53:11.050 --> 00:53:12.270
progress we've made.

00:53:12.270 --> 00:53:15.710
And we've made them small,
we've made them big.

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.970
Especially in the production
of energy.

00:53:17.970 --> 00:53:20.610
For example, this one is 30
feet across and produces

00:53:20.610 --> 00:53:24.090
electricity for millions
of people in China.

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:27.290
So the question I asked was, OK
so how does nature produce

00:53:27.290 --> 00:53:29.200
its energy?

00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.080
And to find out, we need
to look at some cells.

00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.620
This is, for example, these are
protrusions from cells in

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:39.620
your ear that allow me
to hear me right now.

00:53:39.620 --> 00:53:43.120
So let's take for example
a muscle cell.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.480
Cut it open, look at it with
an electron microscope.

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:51.260
And so on the right, there's
the nucleus of the cell.

00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:53.700
The fibers at the top are the
actual muscle fibers.

00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:57.960
And then the green blobs are
mitochondria where all the

00:53:57.960 --> 00:53:59.320
energy gets produced.

00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:04.640
And you only have to eat food,
you breathe oxygen, and you

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:06.440
exhale carbon dioxide.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:09.810
And of course there are no
fires inside your body.

00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:13.620
Instead what happens is that
your body breaks down that

00:54:13.620 --> 00:54:17.260
reaction into small steps
using enzymes.

00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:21.010
And in each step the energy
released by the oxidation is

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:25.640
coupled to the production of
a molecule called ATP.

00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.660
And that molecule, which will
come up in a minute, acts like

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:33.120
a battery, like a common
currency of the body.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.550
You can charge it and you can
discharge it somewhere else

00:54:35.550 --> 00:54:37.030
and use the energy to
do whatever you need

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.280
to do in the body.

00:54:41.369 --> 00:54:44.370
Let's see, where are
we going from here?

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:44.690
Right.

00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:46.720
OK, enzymes.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.580
Enzymes are proteins.

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.730
Proteins are molecules that are
very large that are made

00:54:51.730 --> 00:54:54.400
from small molecules
called amino acids.

00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:57.320
And these are strung together
basically in a linear fashion,

00:54:57.320 --> 00:54:58.830
just like there.

00:54:58.830 --> 00:55:01.870
And then they fold up in these
very complicated shapes that

00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:04.550
are determined by the sequence
of amino acids

00:55:04.550 --> 00:55:06.000
that were put together.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.100
And so the previous picture
is very complicated.

00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:12.400
If I redraw it like this you can
sort of see how the chain

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.690
sort of folds up in is very,
very interesting shape.

00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:16.260
And that was a very
small protein.

00:55:16.260 --> 00:55:18.790
Typically proteins are much,
much larger like that one.

00:55:18.790 --> 00:55:20.270
But the same principles apply.

00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:22.080
There's a sequence that
determines the structure of

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:25.330
the protein and the structure
determines what it does.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:29.590
How does the cell know which
order to put these together?

00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:31.270
It basically reads
them off the DNA.

00:55:31.270 --> 00:55:34.830
That is in fact what
DNA does, mostly.

00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:36.760
So it reads off the sequence,
it makes the protein,

00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:38.030
and it folds up.

00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.740
How the sequence determines the
structure is actually one

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:47.250
of the big unknown,
unpredictable phenomenon of

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.000
biochemistry.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.030
It is very computationally
intensive.

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.210
And actually at Google here,
we've done a bunch of stuff on

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:58.070
G-compute to try and get
around that problem.

00:55:58.070 --> 00:56:00.370
OK, so back to bent
mitochondria.

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:03.760
So when you burn food, what
happens is that all of these

00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:08.530
different reactions pump protons
into a space between

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.400
two membranes in these
mitochondria.

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.170
So it doesn't matter what
reaction it is, it all ends up

00:56:13.170 --> 00:56:16.640
in this common currency
of proton pressure.

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:20.370
And then what happens is that
pressure that gets built up,

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:23.770
flows out of this interstitial
membrane space through this

00:56:23.770 --> 00:56:24.700
molecule there.

00:56:24.700 --> 00:56:27.980
And that's a very big protein
that people have examined and

00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:30.090
it wasn't clear for a
while how it works.

00:56:30.090 --> 00:56:32.780
We knew that the protons were
leaving on the bottom, they

00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:35.490
were going through the membrane,
and somehow this was

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:39.080
powered to the production
of ATP at

00:56:39.080 --> 00:56:40.120
the top of this molecule.

00:56:40.120 --> 00:56:43.190
And how this coupling worked was
not clear until a bunch of

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:46.220
Japanese researchers did this
really cool experiment.

00:56:46.220 --> 00:56:49.910
They drove the engine backwards,
attached it to a

00:56:49.910 --> 00:56:53.700
glass slide, and then attached a
fiber at the top that is big

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:55.100
enough that you can
actually see it.

00:56:55.100 --> 00:56:57.320
Remember this is a
single molecule.

00:56:57.320 --> 00:56:59.630
And what they saw when they
looked down an optical

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:01.130
microscope was this.

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:04.210
This is actually the actual
data from the paper.

00:57:04.210 --> 00:57:05.650
It basically rotates.

00:57:05.650 --> 00:57:09.130
It moves the fiber around
in a circle.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:14.330
And there's a single molecule
sitting at that axis.

00:57:14.330 --> 00:57:17.390
So more work basically showed
that what is in fact happening

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:20.140
is that this is a tiny,
tiny turbine.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:23.670
The protons flow out through the
membrane and they make the

00:57:23.670 --> 00:57:27.360
bottom of the molecule rotate
and the rotation mechanically

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.380
couples the energy to the
production of this chemical

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.700
molecule, sort of charging
it with energy.

00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:34.610
And the way that works is
essentially the camshaft

00:57:34.610 --> 00:57:36.680
inside of that molecule--

00:57:36.680 --> 00:57:38.770
once the molecule is bound
and has reacted,

00:57:38.770 --> 00:57:40.240
the molecule is stuck.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:43.340
And so the camshaft pushes up
the molecule so that it frees

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.720
up the binding site for
the next molecule.

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.320
So in conclusion--

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.880
oh, I should say if you look at
hand right now, there are

00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.490
literally trillions
of these turbines

00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:55.120
whirring away right now.

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.280
And I'm afraid to say, we're
pretty late with the invention

00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:57.720
of the wheel.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:58:01.268
About 3.5 billion years.

00:58:01.268 --> 00:58:02.518
Thanks.

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:11.100
BRADY FORREST: All right, thank
you all for staying.

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:12.380
Thank you to our speakers.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:13.630
Let's give them a hand.

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:23.505
And as I mentioned, there are
Ignites around the world so

00:58:23.505 --> 00:58:26.170
definitely support your local
chapter or just start one.

00:58:26.170 --> 00:58:27.805
You can contact me
about that later.

00:58:27.805 --> 00:58:28.970
I'm Brady on Twitter.

00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:30.220
Take care.
