00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.340
While Joseph Stalin’s cult of personality,
subsequent statues, and certain photos and

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.320
paintings may have you thinking he was a giant
of a man, in truth the former Soviet leader

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.530
and glorious moustache owner was only around
5 feet 5 inches tall (165 cm), give or take

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:26.530
an inch.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.539
While this is decidedly below average in many
regions of the world for men today, in his

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.830
own time, it wasn’t quite as much so, with
the average height of men in Russia as Stalin

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:42.280
ventured into adulthood only ringing in at
just under 5 feet 8 inches (173 cm) tall.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:47.280
Despite only being a little below average,
Stalin went to some rather extreme lengths

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.809
to hide his true stature, as well as other
less literal shortcomings, from the general

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:53.809
public.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.739
Stalin’s propensity to try to make himself
appear taller was no doubt spurred on by comments

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.390
such as the one United States President Harry
Truman (who was approximately 5 feet 8 inches

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.640
tall) made, referring to Stalin as “little
squirt”.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.310
Likewise, Grigol Uratadze, a man who was imprisoned
alongside Stalin during his time as a revolutionary,

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.630
described him as unassuming with a “creeping
way of walking, taking short steps…”,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.900
while Milovan Đilas, a former Yugoslavian
politician mentioned that he was “small”

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.229
with an “ungainly build” in a later book
describing their encounters.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.840
Along with his below average stature, Stalin’s
left arm was shorter than his right with a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.849
slightly withered hand due to an injury he
sustained at age 12 when he was hit by a horse

00:01:35.849 --> 00:01:38.319
and ultimately suffered severe blood poisoning.

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:43.649
Although Stalin retained most of the use of
his left arm throughout his life, it was noticeably

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.590
more stiff and clumsy than his preferred appendage
and he was reportedly unable to fully extend

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.470
his elbow from that age onward.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.470
He mostly hid this injury by folding his hands
over one another when taking photographs or

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.380
by putting his left hand into his pocket.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.179
On top of this, Stalin’s face was covered
in pockmarks from a bout of near fatal smallpox

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.750
he contracted at age 7, which he hid in later
life with, among other methods, his gloriously

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.590
maintained facial hair.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.000
Despite all this, Stalin’s cult of personality
painted a very different picture, as did the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.390
actual artists who painted him.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.420
Presumably because of the fact that displeasing
Stalin at the height of his power was a great

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.900
way to find yourself no longer breathing (and
possibly even erased from all records, see

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.730
Bonus Facts below), most every “official”
photo, painting and sculpture of the Father

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.160
of Nations depicts him as being a man of gigantic
size who towered over his subordinates.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.879
Stalin also insisted that Mikheil Gelovani,
an actor given Stalin’s personal blessing

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.109
to portray him in films and other propaganda,
not accept roles that would require him to

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:59.170
portray “a mere mortal” because of how
similar in appearance the two men were (though

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.219
Gelovani was reportedly much taller).

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.930
To maintain this illusion in face-to-face
meetings, Stalin also took to wearing boots

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.680
with cleverly masked, significantly raised
heels and would often pose for photos while

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.829
standing on a raised platform or positioned
well in front of or above those around him.

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.630
Of course, few of Stalin’s subordinates
would dare ever make fun of Stalin’s penchant

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.150
for trying to look taller, and the propaganda
machine continually depicting him as having

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.069
“characteristics akin to those of a god,”
according to Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev,

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.450
no doubt helped them rationalize Stalin’s
need to maintain the image.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.709
However, the same cannot be said for the likes
of President Truman and Winston Churchill

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.689
who both found the lengths Stalin went to
make himself appear taller amusing when they

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:40.689
met with him.

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:44.200
(And lest you think Truman was just trying
to be insulting with the “little squirt”

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.780
quip, he also had a lot of positive things
to say about Stalin after their 1945 meeting,

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.249
including writing in his diary on July 17th
that “He [Stalin] is honest, but smart as

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.249
hell.“)

00:03:56.249 --> 00:04:01.609
Besides the high heels, platforms in photographs,
and exaggerated stature in paintings, Stalin’s

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.659
private residence in Sochi was specially constructed
with his frame in mind and everything in it,

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:12.200
from the chairs to the staircase were made
slightly smaller than usual so that Stalin

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.739
could use them perfectly comfortably and otherwise
appear especially tall in stature.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.430
Even his pool was only a little over four
feet deep at its maximum depth because he

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.750
couldn’t swim (he did, however, enjoy taking
little walks back and forth in it) and didn’t

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.610
want to be submerged if he ventured into the
deep end.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.460
Other features of Stalin’s mansion, which
you can still tour today, include a smaller

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.360
than regulation size billiards table complete
with a smaller than average, weighted cue

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.300
the dictator used to make his shots more powerful.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.229
Not that he needed it because, once in power,
Stalin reportedly never lost a single game

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:47.009
of billiards against any of his guards…

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.220
(And if that’s not just propaganda akin
to Kim Jong Il’s claim that he shot 11 hole-in-ones

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:51.780
his first time ever playing golf, it no doubt
had something to do with the fact that Stalin

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.460
could have any of his guards killed if they
displeased him.)

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.139
Beyond having numerous people killed for various
reasons, Stalin was also famous for erasing

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:06.669
any record of people he didn’t like from
photos and official documents (a practice

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:13.430
the Ancient Romans referred to as Damnatio
Memoriae), such as the picture on the right.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.289
The disappearing man is Nikolai Yezkov, one
time very powerful head of the NKVD (People’s

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.509
Commissariat for Internal Affairs).

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.050
In his post there, he presided over numerous
tortures and mass-executions during the Great

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:31.120
Purge, but later fell out of favor and himself
was tortured until he admitted to being a

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.729
traitor; after this, he was purged.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:38.349
Once this happened, he became “The Vanishing
Commisar” with records of him, including

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.379
in photographs, suddenly disappearing, which
was no small feat given the high profile position

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:47.249
Yezkov had previously held and the lack of
Photoshop.

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.860
😉
After his presidency, Harry Truman returned

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.479
to his home in Missouri with his only income
his old army pension, which was no more than

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:02.990
$112.56 per month or about $982 today (largely
as a response to his somewhat impoverished

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.780
situation, Congress later passed the Former
Presidents Act to give U.S. President’s

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:08.780
pensions).

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.580
Truman had numerous offers from large corporations
for work, but turned them all down, stating:

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.580
“I knew that they were not interested in
hiring Harry Truman, the person, but what

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.580
they wanted to hire was the former President
of the United States.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.330
I could never lend myself to any transaction,
however respectable, that would commercialize

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.949
on the prestige and the dignity of the office
of the Presidency.”

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:34.690
Another famed leader who is equally famous
for being short of stature, Napoleon Bonaparte,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.699
actually wasn’t, at least by the standards
of the day and region he lived in.

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:42.010
The myth that he was short stems primarily
from the fact that he is listed as 5 feet

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:44.449
2 inches tall at the time of his death.

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.200
However, this is 5 feet 2 inches in French
units.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:51.750
In modern international units, he was just
shy of 5 feet 7 inches.

00:06:51.750 --> 00:06:56.180
Now I know you are saying, “Well, that is
still pretty short for a man”.

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.280
That is true by modern day standards in certain
places in the world, such as the United States.

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:06.971
However, at the time in France, the average
height for an adult male was about 5 feet

00:07:06.971 --> 00:07:08.310
5 inches in modern international units.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:12.180
So in fact, he was slightly above average
in height for his day.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.319
Despite this fact, Napoleon is primarily remembered
for two things; being a master tactician and

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:18.440
being short.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.689
The so called “Napoleon Complex” named
after him, describes men who have an inferiority

00:07:22.689 --> 00:07:38.690
complex or more aptly “Short Man Syndrome”.
