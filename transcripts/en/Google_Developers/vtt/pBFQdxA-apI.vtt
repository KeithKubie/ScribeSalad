00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.080
In the old world of
the personal computer,

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.240
most applications came
in the form of a disc.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.410
To run an application,
you would install it

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.440
onto your computer, where
there you could execute it,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.030
creating and saving files as
needed to your hard drive.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.840
The problem with
this is obvious.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.298
You may have multiple
computers you

00:00:18.298 --> 00:00:20.755
want to access
your project from.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:24.360
It's stuck on one, and if
that computer isn't backed up,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.170
you could easily end up losing
your progress due to computer

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.270
failure.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.550
Luckily, with the
growth of the internet,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.180
most of these
applications, which

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.070
were traditionally offline,
have been moving online

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.920
as web applications.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.690
With this improvement,
we can easily

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.230
access these apps
from any computer

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.250
and not have to worry about
keeping our data in sync.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.370
However, with this
evolution, we've

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.020
shifted a lot of responsibility
onto the developer

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.360
of these websites to
properly store user data,

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.150
keep backups, and
facilitate sharing properly.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.560
As you can imagine,
this is no small task.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.750
This is where Google
Drive comes in.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.140
Google Drive can be thought of
as a user's personal hard drive

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.530
in the cloud.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.220
What does that mean exactly?

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.390
Well, let me tell you.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.310
Drive is built to be the
place where you store,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.650
share, and collaborate
on personal files

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:17.970
across multiple desktops
or mobile devices.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.600
And it's all stored on
Google's infrastructure,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.470
ensuring your data is safe,
secure, and always backed up.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.630
Here's where it starts
to get interesting.

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.000
See, Google recently
created a Drive API,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.210
which allows developers to
easily store and retrieve data

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.320
from a customer's Google Drive,
their personal hard drive

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.620
in the cloud.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.500
This data could be anything, a
document, image, video, song,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.480
or even save game data
recording how far you

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.570
got in your latest dungeon raid.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.200
All this data can be saved using
Google's infrastructure, which

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.320
will take care of backups,
scale with your application,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.220
and make it super simple to
sync across multiple devices.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.250
This way, developers
can focus more

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.590
on building great applications
and leave the cloud storage

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.580
to the experts by using
the Google Drive API.
