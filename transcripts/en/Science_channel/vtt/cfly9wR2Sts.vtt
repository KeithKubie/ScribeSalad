00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:07.334
WE HAVE LIGHT, AND THE VISUAL
SPECTRUM GOES FROM RED TO BLUE,

00:00:07.334 --> 00:00:08.601
JUST LIKE A RAINBOW.

00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:11.501
BUT OUTSIDE OF THAT,
THERE'S LIGHT THAT WE CAN'T SEE,

00:00:11.501 --> 00:00:14.033
AND ON THE BLUE SIDE,
THAT'S CALLED ULTRAVIOLET.

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:16.901
Narrator: U.V. LIGHT
CAN BE CREATED ARTIFICIALLY

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:20.033
AND HAS MANY USES, FROM
STERILIZING HOSPITAL EQUIPMENT

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:24.901
TO GROWING INDOOR PLANTS
TO AFFECTING SKIN COLOR.

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.400
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF
U.V. LIGHT -- UVA AND UVB.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.634
NOW, UVA IS A LONGER WAVELENGTH.

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:33.834
IT CAN PENETRATE DEEPER,
AND IT'S THE U.V. RAYS

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:37.667
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE IMMEDIATE TAN THAT YOU GET.

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:41.634
UVB LIGHT GIVES YOU VITAMIN D,
WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH

00:00:41.634 --> 00:00:44.868
BUT CAN ALSO CAUSE SKIN CANCER
DOWN THE LINE.

00:00:44.868 --> 00:00:46.734
U.V. LIGHT DAMAGES
THE SKIN CELLS

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:49.334
BY BASICALLY DESTROYING THE DNA.

00:00:49.334 --> 00:00:50.634
WHEN YOU TAN,

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:54.934
WHEN YOUR SKIN CELLS ARE EXPOSED
TO ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION,

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:58.334
THE DAMAGE TRIGGERS THE RELEASE
OF MELANIN.

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.133
MELANIN IS THE DARK PIGMENT
THAT CAUSES TAN.
