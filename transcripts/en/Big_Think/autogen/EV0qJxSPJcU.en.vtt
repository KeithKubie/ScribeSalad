what I find particularly upsetting is

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690
what I find particularly upsetting is
 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:18.170
what I find particularly upsetting is
not just what's happening to people who

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
not just what's happening to people who
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.910
not just what's happening to people who
have been working their whole lives in

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920
have been working their whole lives in
 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.519
have been working their whole lives in
the auto industry but also that the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529
the auto industry but also that the
 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.460
the auto industry but also that the
United Auto Workers you know founded by

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470
United Auto Workers you know founded by
 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.279
United Auto Workers you know founded by
the Reuther brothers to me were kind of

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289
the Reuther brothers to me were kind of
 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.800
the Reuther brothers to me were kind of
like the you know the Harvard and Yale

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810
like the you know the Harvard and Yale
 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.450
like the you know the Harvard and Yale
of the labor union movement and its

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460
of the labor union movement and its
 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.210
of the labor union movement and its
really a testament to them that auto

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:38.220
really a testament to them that auto
 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.220
really a testament to them that auto
workers were able to work and have

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230
workers were able to work and have
 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.860
workers were able to work and have
careers and really be middle class and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
careers and really be middle class and
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.950
careers and really be middle class and
really do well and you know in the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
really do well and you know in the
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.680
really do well and you know in the
middle of all of this situation and our

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690
middle of all of this situation and our
 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.070
middle of all of this situation and our
whole economy is essentially this view

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080
whole economy is essentially this view
 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.170
whole economy is essentially this view
that there's something in that that's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180
that there's something in that that's
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.490
that there's something in that that's
not workable and I think some pieces of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500
not workable and I think some pieces of
 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590
not workable and I think some pieces of
that may very well not be workable and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600
that may very well not be workable and
 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.729
that may very well not be workable and
some pieces of that I think are showing

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739
some pieces of that I think are showing
 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.940
some pieces of that I think are showing
what what the next phase of our economy

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
what what the next phase of our economy
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.570
what what the next phase of our economy
is going to look like and by that I mean

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580
is going to look like and by that I mean
 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.670
is going to look like and by that I mean
if you look at Detroit as one of our

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680
if you look at Detroit as one of our
 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.010
if you look at Detroit as one of our
large economic centers in this country

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020
large economic centers in this country
 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.080
large economic centers in this country
you had a whole group of people who

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090
you had a whole group of people who
 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.209
you had a whole group of people who
could afford a lot of things and paid a

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:20.219
could afford a lot of things and paid a
 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:22.580
could afford a lot of things and paid a
lot of taxes and supported a whole lot

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590
lot of taxes and supported a whole lot
 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.859
lot of taxes and supported a whole lot
of other industries all brought to you

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869
of other industries all brought to you
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.389
of other industries all brought to you
in large part by the United Auto Workers

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399
in large part by the United Auto Workers
 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.929
in large part by the United Auto Workers
and so we have to be careful that we

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939
and so we have to be careful that we
 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.599
and so we have to be careful that we
don't you know kill the patient by

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609
don't you know kill the patient by
 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:34.910
don't you know kill the patient by
curing you know one one piece of this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920
curing you know one one piece of this
 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.239
curing you know one one piece of this
this problem so I think it is a good

00:01:38.239 --> 00:01:38.249
this problem so I think it is a good
 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.380
this problem so I think it is a good
thing that the Obama administration is

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390
thing that the Obama administration is
 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.749
thing that the Obama administration is
recognizing that this is really nuanced

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759
recognizing that this is really nuanced
 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.940
recognizing that this is really nuanced
this isn't just about fixing the auto

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950
this isn't just about fixing the auto
 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.830
this isn't just about fixing the auto
industry per se but that it's a whole

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840
industry per se but that it's a whole
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.560
industry per se but that it's a whole
ecosystem and system together

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570
 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.719
of course I wish I had like a very short

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729
of course I wish I had like a very short
 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.060
of course I wish I had like a very short
and pithy answer to that but you know my

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070
and pithy answer to that but you know my
 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.700
and pithy answer to that but you know my
hunch is that because this is called

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710
hunch is that because this is called
 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.320
hunch is that because this is called
like big think big ideas that we're

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330
like big think big ideas that we're
 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.380
like big think big ideas that we're
realizing that you can't expect a

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390
realizing that you can't expect a
 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.730
realizing that you can't expect a
certain rate of return on manufacturing

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740
certain rate of return on manufacturing
 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.949
certain rate of return on manufacturing
in the auto industry and expect to have

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959
in the auto industry and expect to have
 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.890
in the auto industry and expect to have
one in America that is that we can't

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900
one in America that is that we can't
 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.870
one in America that is that we can't
have private equity rates of return of

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
have private equity rates of return of
 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.970
have private equity rates of return of
eighteen to thirty five percent and that

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980
eighteen to thirty five percent and that
 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.380
eighteen to thirty five percent and that
we're going to have to be thinking that

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390
we're going to have to be thinking that
 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.850
we're going to have to be thinking that
there's something important about having

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860
there's something important about having
 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.320
there's something important about having
certain industries and there's going to

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
certain industries and there's going to
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.229
certain industries and there's going to
be a governmental role in keeping these

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239
be a governmental role in keeping these
 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.090
be a governmental role in keeping these
alive that it's crucial that we make

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100
alive that it's crucial that we make
 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.620
alive that it's crucial that we make
things in America and I think this is

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630
things in America and I think this is
 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.780
things in America and I think this is
the beginning of that realization i

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790
the beginning of that realization i
 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.640
the beginning of that realization i
think that people are starting to see

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650
think that people are starting to see
 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.560
think that people are starting to see
there's something important here i think

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570
there's something important here i think
 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.510
there's something important here i think
sometimes people think this is just

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520
sometimes people think this is just
 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.479
sometimes people think this is just
about bailing out the auto industry you

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489
about bailing out the auto industry you
 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.220
about bailing out the auto industry you
know beginning middle and end and done i

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230
know beginning middle and end and done i
 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.800
know beginning middle and end and done i
think hopefully there are people who are

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810
think hopefully there are people who are
 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.600
think hopefully there are people who are
saying wow there is something deeper

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610
saying wow there is something deeper
 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.130
saying wow there is something deeper
here that we need to understand that

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140
here that we need to understand that
 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.410
here that we need to understand that
government can be a source of capital or

government can be a source of capital or

government can be a source of capital or
can subsidize some parts of capital or

can subsidize some parts of capital or

can subsidize some parts of capital or
compare some pizza the risk because we

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640
compare some pizza the risk because we
 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.460
compare some pizza the risk because we
recognize that it's really important to

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470
recognize that it's really important to
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.590
recognize that it's really important to
have a middle class in America and I

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600
have a middle class in America and I
 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.090
have a middle class in America and I
think that's really what's at stake you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100
think that's really what's at stake you
 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.470
think that's really what's at stake you
know we may very well come out of this

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480
know we may very well come out of this
 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.789
know we may very well come out of this
but the question is are we going to come

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799
but the question is are we going to come
 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.140
but the question is are we going to come
out of it looking you know like

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150
out of it looking you know like
 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.600
out of it looking you know like
Argentina you know with a very small

group of rich people in a very large

group of rich people in a very large
group of everybody else and I don't

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880
group of everybody else and I don't
 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.990
group of everybody else and I don't
think that's what America is about

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000
 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.200
I just think that's just factually wrong

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210
I just think that's just factually wrong
 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.600
I just think that's just factually wrong
if you say that there are elements in

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610
if you say that there are elements in
 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.310
if you say that there are elements in
terms of the costs of health and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320
terms of the costs of health and
 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.300
terms of the costs of health and
pensions which i think is true then

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310
pensions which i think is true then
 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.450
pensions which i think is true then
that's a piece of it you know it's also

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460
that's a piece of it you know it's also
 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.370
that's a piece of it you know it's also
a piece of not having a government

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380
a piece of not having a government
 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.220
a piece of not having a government

Americans may very well when asked say

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540
Americans may very well when asked say

Americans may very well when asked say
they want the biggest behemoth cars and

they want the biggest behemoth cars and

they want the biggest behemoth cars and
you know that they can get their hands

you know that they can get their hands
 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.260
you know that they can get their hands
on but that's not why we have government

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270
on but that's not why we have government
 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.570
on but that's not why we have government
leaders and that you know one of the

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580
leaders and that you know one of the
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.000
leaders and that you know one of the
reasons why people want bigger cars is

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010
reasons why people want bigger cars is
 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.190
reasons why people want bigger cars is
because other people have big cars and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200
because other people have big cars and
