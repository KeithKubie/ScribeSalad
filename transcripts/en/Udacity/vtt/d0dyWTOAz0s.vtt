00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.982
We've just reviewed a bit of new material on the shape of a function and how

00:00:03.982 --> 00:00:07.454
that's affected by its degree, and also how changing the sign of the

00:00:07.454 --> 00:00:13.816
coefficient flips the graph over the x axis. Now, I've drawn four different

00:00:13.816 --> 00:00:18.680
graphs here, and labeled them a, b, c, and d. They represent 4 types of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.904
functions which I've listed right here. One of them shows a polynomial with an

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:27.565
even degree and a positive leading coefficient. One shows a polynomial with an

00:00:27.565 --> 00:00:31.481
even degree and a negative leading coefficient. Another shows a polynomial with

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:35.537
an odd degree and positive leading coefficient. And the last one shows a

00:00:35.537 --> 00:00:39.868
polynomial with odd degree and a negative leading coefficient. I'd like you to

00:00:39.868 --> 00:00:44.546
tell me which one of these graphs matches each of these categories. Please put

00:00:44.546 --> 00:00:48.753
the letter of each graph next to the description over here that it matches.
