00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.060
To film school, or not to film school?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.060
That is the question.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.280
Or it might be, if you’re interested in
becoming a filmmaker.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.650
And it doesn’t have an easy answer.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.579
Some filmmakers, like Francis Ford Coppola,
Martin Scorsese, and George Lucas, attended

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:16.990
film school and have thrived making feature
films.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.010
On the other hand, James Cameron and Steven
Soderbergh have both won Academy Awards for

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:23.990
Best Director without ever attending a single
class.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.539
Everyone’s experience is going to be different,
but there are some things that you can generally

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.300
expect to get from going to film school.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.010
And with some careful consideration, you might
be able to chart a course that’s right for

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.360
you and emerge as the next big thing.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:48.060
[Opening Music Plays]

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.220
The world’s first film school was founded in 1919.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.920
As with many early film schools, the focus
at the Moscow Film School was on studying

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.199
films that already existed, rather than actually
making movies.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.650
The theories developed by the students and
teachers in Moscow eventually gave birth to

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.170
the Soviet Montage film movement
and movies like Battleship Potemkin and Man

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.910
with a Movie Camera.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.280
In 1929, the University of Southern California’s
School of Cinema Arts was founded by early

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.900
cinema big-shots like Mary Pickford, Ernst
Lubitsch, and D.W. Griffith.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.320
USC has maintained that close connection to
Hollywood right up to the present day, counting

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.180
George Lucas, Judd Apatow, and Star Wars:
Episode 8 director Rian Johnson among its alumni.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.420
And in 1965, two major film schools were founded
in New York City: one at New York University’s

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.900
Tisch School of the Arts, and the other as
part of Columbia University’s School of

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.900
the Arts.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.240
Although younger than the Southern California
schools, NYU and Columbia have caught up in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.190
terms of the success of their graduates.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.479
Spike Lee, Martin Scorsese, and Brokeback
Mountain director Ang Lee all went to NYU,

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.960
while Columbia boasts Hurt Locker director
Kathryn Bigelow, James Mangold who made 3:10

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.060
to Yuma and Logan, and Jennifer Lee, the writer
and co-director of a little movie called Frozen.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.240
These days, there are film schools in almost
every state in the United States, as well

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.860
as in many other countries around the world.

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.680
You can find them in big international cities
like Paris, London, and Beijing, to smaller

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.509
places like Austin, Texas; Mahwah, New Jersey;
and Anchorage, Alaska.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.119
Some are well known, like the programs at
CalArts, the American Film Institute or AFI,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.580
or the University of California Los Angeles,
better known as UCLA.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.750
Others are hidden gems, like Emerson College
in Boston or Denver’s Colorado Film School.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.580
The point is: if you decide that film school
is right for you, you have options, no matter

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.580
where you live.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.100
So what will you learn if you go?

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.320
Film schools can be undergraduate or graduate
programs at universities, colleges, and community

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.320
colleges.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.820
They might be free standing degrees at those
schools, or they might be housed in other

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.800
departments, like English, Fine Arts, Theater,
Media Studies, or Communications.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.370
Most film schools will teach you to both study
and make films.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.730
Education isn’t necessarily just about practicing
a trade.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.170
It can also be about exposing yourself to
other ways of thinking, writing, creating,

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.170
or watching.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.260
In other words, it can be a time for experimentation!

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.421
Classes on film history, theory, and criticism
will introduce you to films, filmmakers, film

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.310
movements, and various ways to think critically
about them.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.670
While courses on things like screenwriting,
cinematography, directing, and editing will

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.060
give you the skills and experience you’ll
need to produce your own films.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.130
These same subjects are taught in many film
schools, but teaching methods can differ.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.980
Most schools follow either the conservatory
or liberal arts approach.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.930
Conservatory schools, like the American Film
Institute, the New York Film Academy, and

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.910
to some extent NYU, focus on educating world-class
artists and technicians devoted to a single

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.370
field within filmmaking.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.270
Very early on at a conservatory school, you’ll
choose a “track” with help from faculty

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.400
and advisors, and you’ll study that subject
almost exclusively.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.540
You might decide to become an editor, a cinematographer,
a director, or a sound designer, and your

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.980
classes and exercises will be geared toward
the craft, art, and technology of that particular role.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.120
As a result, conservatory schools tend to
turn out graduates who excel at their particular

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.850
job and know it inside and out.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.420
If you’re looking for a broader understanding
of cinema and its place in the world, or you

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.160
don’t yet know which track you want to pursue,
a liberal arts-based film school might be

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160
a better fit.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.180
In practice, liberal arts film schools offer
students the chance to try a variety of filmmaking

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.790
roles, and gain a deeper understanding of
the whole filmmaking process, rather than

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.380
just one specific part of it.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.840
And while students will still learn how to
line up a shot or make a rough cut, they’ll

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.880
also be encouraged to think about cinema in
its larger cultural, economic, historical,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.120
and political contexts.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.570
Of course, you’ll also find film schools
that split the difference between these two

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.150
approaches, providing a broad liberal arts
education for initial courses, and pivoting

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.530
to a more track-based curriculum for the later
ones.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.040
So what does film school really get you?

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.540
First and foremost: time.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.900
School gives you the time to focus on the
craft of filmmaking in a structured environment.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.290
Time to fail, learn from your mistakes, and
try again.

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.970
And time to experiment and find your artistic
voice, while you’re given critical feedback

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.980
from teachers and your fellow students.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.060
Depending on where you go, film school might
also let you move closer to a filmmaking hub,

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.730
be it New York, Los Angeles, or even Chicago,
Atlanta, or Austin.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.540
Just being close to the action can be a powerful
motivator for aspiring filmmakers.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.870
In terms of technology, many film schools
give you the opportunity to get your hands

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.030
on a lot of the equipment you’ll find on
sets – like jibs, dollies, cameras, or microphones

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:52.650
– while an expert helps guide you.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.180
And you’ll learn to collaborate!

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.190
Film is an intensely collaborative industry
and medium, and being forced to rely on and

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.480
work with your peers is a big part of the
film school experience.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.590
Even more importantly, film school gives you
access to a community of people who are just

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.010
as obsessed with films and filmmaking as you
are!

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.691
That network of teachers, mentors, and trusted
peers will become your allies as you all develop

00:05:12.691 --> 00:05:16.020
your creative projects and find opportunities
to work in the film industry.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.520
Many film school graduates think of this community
as one of the biggest benefits of their formal education.

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.520
And, of course, you’ll earn a degree.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.700
A degree can have value as a symbol of your
passion, commitment, and follow-through, but,

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:28.150
sadly, it doesn’t guarantee you a job or
a career.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.770
And that leads us into some arguments against
attending film school.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:32.770
It’s expensive.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.700
Not only will you pay tuition, but you’ll
have to fund your own films.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.800
And don’t forget, you might have to move
to a bigger, pricier city to pursue your dreams.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:43.750
Not to mention, film is an exceptionally competitive
industry that often depends on who you know

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.650
and how good you are at your job.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.750
There’s a lot of luck and timing mixed in
with the tenacity, hard work, and talent required

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:50.750
to succeed.

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.460
Also, your learning style might not be suited
to a classroom.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:57.480
Some people thrive in an academic environment,
while others do better with a hands-on approach

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.660
or more unstructured exploration.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.420
If that’s you, film school might not be
the best option.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.830
But if you decide film school is too expensive
or not a good fit, there are a number of other

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:08.860
paths you can take to become a professional
filmmaker.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:12.139
Many directors started out working as crew
members on other people’s films before making

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:13.139
movies of their own.

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.570
Alfred Hitchcock began as a title designer,
and worked his way up to directing classics

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.370
like Psycho and Rear Window.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.870
Before dreaming up The Terminator, Aliens,
Titanic, and Avatar, James Cameron got his

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:26.380
start as a set painter for famous B-movie
producer Roger Corman.

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.580
Cameron reportedly mastered so many different
skills that, today, his crew members talk

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.050
about upping their game because he can probably
do their job at least as well as they can.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.700
This kind of apprenticeship approach was even
built into the structure of some international

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.750
film industries until fairly recently.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:44.670
Up until at least the 1980s in England, for
example, most directors were obligated to

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.330
put in their time as an Assistant Director
before they were given the chance to make

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.330
their own films.

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.180
In the 1990s, though, A-list directors like
Quentin Tarantino and Steven Soderbergh took

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:54.770
an entirely different path.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.610
Instead of apprenticing for other filmmakers,
they both studied hundreds if not thousands

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.870
of films on their own, with a focus and intensity
most film students couldn’t muster.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:07.780
Their feature film debuts – Reservoir Dogs
and sex, lies, and videotape – both display

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.870
an incredible grasp of storytelling, film
grammar, and tone, at a level remarkable for

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:14.080
self-taught directors.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:17.270
Paul Thomas Anderson, acclaimed director of
Boogie Nights and There Will Be Blood, split

00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.300
the difference.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.280
He was an intense student of film long before
he got to film school… and then dropped

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.500
out after the first day!

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:27.550
The proliferation of things like Blu-ray special
features and online tutorials make this kind

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:30.140
of DIY approach more possible than ever before.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:33.590
“Lessons from the Screenplay” on YouTube
and the website and podcast ScriptNotes are

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.560
great resources for screenwriters.

00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:39.470
While sites like Cinematography.com can teach
you tips and tricks about cameras, lighting,

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.470
and special effects.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.090
In fact, the falling cost of film equipment
and the ability to distribute your work on

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:48.180
the Internet has done more to change the film
school equation in the last decade than anything else.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.680
You can build online communities and peer
groups of like-minded filmmakers from around

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:54.590
the world, which might make film school less
necessary.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:57.690
And it’s not like Warner Brothers is gonna
turn you down for a directing job because

00:07:57.690 --> 00:07:59.580
they find out you don’t have a degree!

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.580
Think about it this way.

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:03.050
If you want to become a doctor, you need to
go to medical school, right?

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:06.490
If you can afford it and your grades are good
enough, you’ll graduate and – boom – you’re

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.490
a doctor.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:10.669
It doesn’t guarantee you a job, but it does
mean you’re very likely to find work in

00:08:10.669 --> 00:08:11.669
the medical field.

00:08:11.669 --> 00:08:13.419
It’s also the only way to become a doctor.

00:08:13.419 --> 00:08:17.199
For filmmakers, film school is just one
of many paths you might take.

00:08:17.199 --> 00:08:20.930
That’s the great advantage and drawback
to pursuing a career in film: you can get

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.560
there any number of ways… but none of them
are guaranteed.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.350
So, is film school the right choice for you?

00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:26.610
I can’t tell you that.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.870
But luckily, the person who can tell you
is watching this video right now.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:31.510
...It’s you, I’m talking about you.

00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:35.150
Take some time and think about the environments
in which you learn best, the communities you

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.930
could build and be a part of, and what you
can afford.

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:41.760
And remember: whatever form your education
takes, it’s the work you do, and the kind

00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:43.990
of collaborator you become, that matter most.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.040
Today we talked about the history of film
school and the different approaches they take

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.520
to educating filmmakers.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.900
We discussed the benefits of film school,
from access to equipment, peer groups, and

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:54.270
mentors to the time to make mistakes.

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.330
And we looked at other options, from apprenticeships
to self-education and building your own community

00:08:58.330 --> 00:08:59.740
of collaborators online.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:03.200
Next time, we’ll focus our attention on
the history and exciting current state of

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.480
television production.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:08.140
