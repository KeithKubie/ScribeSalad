00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:01.533
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we can find

00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:07.200
the Maclaurin series
representation of f of x,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.633
where f of x is equal to x to the third

00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:12.767
times cosine of x squared.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:14.993
I encourage you to pause the
video and now try to do it.

00:00:14.993 --> 00:00:16.500
Remember, the Maclaurin series is just

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.700
the Taylor series centered at zero.

00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.933
Let's say our goal here is
the first five non-zero terms

00:00:24.333 --> 00:00:26.635
of the Maclaurin series representation,

00:00:26.635 --> 00:00:28.600
or Maclaurin series approximation of this.

00:00:29.967 --> 00:00:31.900
I'm assuming you had paused the video

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.533
and you had attempted to do this.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.267
There's a good chance
that you might have gotten

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.833
quite frustrated when you did this,

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:39.702
because in order to find a
Taylor series, Maclaurin series,

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.367
we need to find the
derivatives of this function,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.566
and as soon as you start to do that,

00:00:43.566 --> 00:00:44.833
it starts to get painful.

00:00:45.134 --> 00:00:47.400
F prime of x is going to be,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.635
let's see, product rule,

00:00:48.635 --> 00:00:52.800
so it's three x squared
times cosine of x squared

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.366
plus x to the third

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.833
times the derivative of this thing,

00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:02.266
which is going to be two x
times negative sine of x,

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:05.200
negative sine of x squared.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.566
Just that was be pretty painful.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.938
But it's only going to
get more and more painful

00:01:07.938 --> 00:01:10.559
as we take the second and
third and fourth derivative.

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:11.500
We might have to take more,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.766
because some of these terms
might end up being zeros.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.066
We want the first five non-zero terms.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.466
The second derivative, this
is going to be painful.

00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:22.003
This is going to be painful.

00:01:22.003 --> 00:01:23.400
Then the third and fourth derivatives

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.266
are going to be even more painful.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.867
So what do we do here?

00:01:26.867 --> 00:01:27.833
You could just do this.

00:01:27.833 --> 00:01:29.334
Let's evaluate them each at zero,

00:01:29.334 --> 00:01:31.900
and then use those for our coefficients,

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.935
but you're probably guessing correctly

00:01:34.088 --> 00:01:36.266
that there's an easier way to do this.

00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:38.633
I will give you a hint.

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:45.600
We know what the Maclaurin
series for cosine of x is.

00:01:45.866 --> 00:01:47.200
We've done that in the previous video.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.261
If you want to see that
again, there's another video.

00:01:50.266 --> 00:01:53.733
Look up "cosine Taylor series
at zero" on Khan Academy,

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:54.966
and you'll find that.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:55.966
But we already know from that,

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:59.566
and this is one of the most
famous Maclaurin series,

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:01.866
we know that this is a g of x.

00:02:01.866 --> 00:02:03.200
We say g of x

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.101
is equal to cosine of x.

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:09.800
Well, we know how this, what this is like.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:13.301
There are the Maclaurin
series approximation of that

00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:16.700
is going to be one minus x squared

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:18.666
over two factorial,

00:02:18.803 --> 00:02:23.400
plus x to the fourth over four factorial,

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:28.566
minus x to the sixth over six factorial,

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:30.900
plus, and I could keep
going on and on and on.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.200
You kind of see where this is going.

00:02:32.205 --> 00:02:35.933
Plus x to the eighth over eight factorial,

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:37.633
and it just keeps going,

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.619
minus, plus, on and on and on and on.

00:02:40.033 --> 00:02:42.967
But we wanted first five
terms, so this is a start.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.044
I know we wanted the first
five terms of this thing,

00:02:45.044 --> 00:02:45.733
but bear with me.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.100
We'll see how this thing right over here

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.407
is going to be useful.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.433
Now that I've given you a
little bit of a reminder

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:53.633
on the Maclaurin series
representation of cosine of x,

00:02:54.101 --> 00:02:56.666
my hint to you is, can we use this

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:01.067
to find the Maclaurin series
representation of this,

00:03:01.233 --> 00:03:02.433
right up here?

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:06.405
Remember, all this is, this
is x to the third times ...

00:03:06.405 --> 00:03:07.933
And I'm just rereading it for you,

00:03:07.933 --> 00:03:12.400
this is x to the third
times g of x squared.

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:15.833
That's a sizable hint.

00:03:16.366 --> 00:03:17.733
I encourage you to pause the video again

00:03:17.733 --> 00:03:19.633
and see if you can work through this.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.266
Let me rewrite.

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:23.833
I'm assuming you had a go at it.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.568
Let me rewrite what I just wrote.

00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:28.800
I just told you that g of x ...

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.367
or f of x. F of x ...

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:34.266
If I wanted to write it as,

00:03:35.927 --> 00:03:37.656
I guess you could say as a function,

00:03:37.656 --> 00:03:40.533
or if I want to construct it using g of x,

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:44.159
I could rewrite it as x
to the third times ...

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.367
instead of cosine of x squared,

00:03:45.367 --> 00:03:47.300
that's the same thing as g of x squared.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:50.133
So x to the third times g,

00:03:51.034 --> 00:03:53.000
g of x squared.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:57.566
G of x squared.

00:03:58.867 --> 00:04:00.066
G of x is just cosine.

00:04:00.066 --> 00:04:02.134
G of x squared is going
to be cosine of x squared.

00:04:02.466 --> 00:04:04.500
Then you're going to multiply
that times x to the third.

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:09.900
Well, can't we just apply this
insight to the approximation?

00:04:10.502 --> 00:04:11.866
You might be asking that question.

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:14.900
My answer to you is,
"Yes, you absolutely can."

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.566
Notice, when you substitute
your xes for x squared,

00:04:18.566 --> 00:04:20.066
you'll just get another polynomial.

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:22.000
And if you multiply
that by x to the third,

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.634
you're just going to
get another polynomial.

00:04:23.634 --> 00:04:27.766
That actually will be the
Maclaurin series representation

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.734
of what we started off with.

00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:32.233
We actually will get the
Maclaurin series representation

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.333
of this thing right over here.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:36.466
So we could say that f of x

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.800
is approximately equal to

00:04:40.433 --> 00:04:42.700
x to the third times

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:44.700
x to the third times ...

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.667
Let me get myself some
space right over here.

00:04:47.304 --> 00:04:49.500
G of x squared.

00:04:49.804 --> 00:04:52.400
Over here, this is
approximation for g of x,

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.873
and if we kept going on and on forever,

00:04:53.873 --> 00:04:57.000
it would be a representation of g of x.

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.003
So every place where we see an x,

00:04:59.003 --> 00:05:00.433
let's replace it with an x squared.

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.967
This is going to be one minus ...

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.567
So x squared squared is x to the fourth,

00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:08.133
x to the fourth over two factorial,

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:08.873
which is really just two,

00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:10.867
but I like to put the factorial there

00:05:10.867 --> 00:05:12.033
because you see the pattern.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.433
Plus, if our x is now x squared,

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:18.100
x squared to the fourth
power is x to the eighth,

00:05:18.874 --> 00:05:22.400
x to the eighth power over four factorial,

00:05:23.233 --> 00:05:26.800
minus x squared to the sixth power

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.533
is x to the 12th over six factorial,

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.933
and then plus x squared to the eighth

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:38.268
is x to the 16th power
over eight factorial,

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:41.004
and of course, we can keep
going on and on and on.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:43.433
Minus, plus. But we just care
about the first five terms,

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:45.133
the non-zero terms, and we're just saying

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:47.139
this is an approximation, anyway.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.333
So we can say that this is going to be

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.535
approximately equal to,

00:05:50.535 --> 00:05:52.000
we distribute the x to the third,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.200
and I'm going to do it
in magenta just for fun,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.968
so distribute the x to the third,

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:57.833
we get x to the third,

00:05:58.435 --> 00:06:03.435
minus x to the seventh over two factorial,

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:09.166
plus x to the 11th over four factorial,

00:06:10.001 --> 00:06:14.733
minus x to the 15th over six factorial,

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.674
plus x to the 19th ...

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:23.433
x to the 19th over eight factorial.

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:25.133
That's the first five non-zero terms,

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:26.633
and we are done.

00:06:26.633 --> 00:06:28.666
When you actually see what we got,

00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:32.233
you realize it would have
taken you forever to do this

00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:35.467
by, I guess you could say, by brute force,

00:06:35.467 --> 00:06:38.833
because you would have had
to find the 19th derivative

00:06:38.833 --> 00:06:40.169
of all of this madness.

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:41.533
But when you realize that, "Hey, gee,

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:43.733
"if I can just re-express this function

00:06:43.733 --> 00:06:45.967
"as, essentially,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.767
"x to a power times

00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:53.066
"something that I know
the Maclaurin series of,

00:06:53.066 --> 00:06:53.833
"especially ..."

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:55.067
Well, if you view it this way:

00:06:55.067 --> 00:06:58.000
if I can write, if I can rewrite ...

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.800
Let me say it in a less confusing way.

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:02.267
If I can rewrite my function

00:07:02.267 --> 00:07:04.967
so it is equal to some ...

00:07:04.967 --> 00:07:06.400
Actually, I can even
throw a coefficient here.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.266
If it's equal to some A x to the n power,

00:07:10.673 --> 00:07:12.800
times some function ...

00:07:13.166 --> 00:07:14.100
Let me just use a new color.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.933
Times, purple.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.500
Times g of B,

00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:25.200
B x to some other power,

00:07:26.036 --> 00:07:28.534
where I can fairly easily,

00:07:28.534 --> 00:07:29.667
without too much computation,

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:30.804
maybe I already know,

00:07:30.804 --> 00:07:34.534
if I know the Maclaurin series
representation of g of x,

00:07:34.867 --> 00:07:36.600
if I know what g of x is going to be,

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.800
then I can do exactly what
I did just in this video.

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.233
I find the Maclaurin series
representation for g,

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:42.266
every place where I saw an x,

00:07:42.266 --> 00:07:44.366
I replaced it with what I have over here,

00:07:44.366 --> 00:07:47.633
the B x to the m power,
where m is some exponent.

00:07:47.933 --> 00:07:49.567
That will give me another polynomial,

00:07:49.567 --> 00:07:50.833
another power series,

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:52.900
and then I multiply it time A x to the n,

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.033
and that's going to, once again,

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:54.733
give me another power series,

00:07:54.733 --> 00:07:57.702
and that will be the power
series for my original function.

00:07:58.133 --> 00:07:59.333
Very exciting.
