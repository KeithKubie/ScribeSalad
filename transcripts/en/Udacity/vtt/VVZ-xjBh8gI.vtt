00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.790
The first kind of relationship we look at is generalization.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.550
This relationship between two classes indicates that an instance of one of

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.500
the two classes, the child class are, are the instances of one of

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.990
the two classes are a kind of instance of the other class,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.050
called the parent class. This means that the instances of the child class

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.580
are the subset of the instances of the parent class. In our text,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.580
words like kind of and type of, indicate a generalization relationship.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.150
Even if these words aren't explicit in the text, the class names, themselves,

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.320
can serve as indicators. For example, cars are a sub class of vehicles.
