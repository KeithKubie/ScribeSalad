00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
Hi, I'm John Green, this is Crash Course: US History, and today we begin discussing the American Revolution.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.339
So two things to keep in mind here:

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.679
One, the American Revolution and the American
War for Independence are not the same thing.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.620
And two, while I know this will upset some of you, the American Revolution was not really about taxes.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.660
Mr. Green, Mr. Green!
It was about tea, right?

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:20.181
Also, it was not about tea.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.360
The Boston Tea party was about taxes and our
God-given right to smuggle.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.660
It's a little confusing, me from the past,
but that's why Crash Course is here!

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:36.380
[Theme Music]

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:47.800
So as you'll recall, the Seven Years War ended with the Treaty of Paris in 1763 which made the colonists cranky because it limited their ability to take land from the Indians, and it also left them holding the bag for a lot of war debt.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:56.500
Wars, as you may have noticed, are expensive, and the British government had to borrow 150,000,000 pounds, and the interest payments on that money ate up half of the national budget.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.460
So in order to pay for the war, the British
decided to raise taxes.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.960
And since the primary beneficiaries of the war had been the American colonists, the British government felt it was only fair if some of the burden fell to them.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.020
Now, taxes on colonial trade were nothing
new.

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:15.680
The British government had placed taxes on a bunch of items in order to reduce competition with Britain, including wool and hats and “mole-asses.”

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.320
Why did they place a tax on mole-asses?

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.330
It doesn’t seem like that would be a huge market.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.620
Oh, molasses.
Right, of course.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.240
But those taxes were about trying to regulate trade in a mercantilist way more than trying to pay back war debt.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.490
And also they were easy to avoid via smuggling,
which we did because this is America!

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.800
[Patriotic Rock Music]

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.660
But mostly the colonists were angry because they didn’t have any say about the new taxes that Britain was imposing.

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.520
I mean after all, by 1760, some colonies had been setting their own taxes through their own legislatures for 100 years.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.280
So the taxes themselves weren’t really the problem;
it was their lack of Parliamentary representation.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:04.400
The first purportedly oppressive tax, the Sugar Act of 1764, extended the Molasses Act by changing the tax on imports from the Caribbean from 6 cents per gallon all the way up to 3 cents per gallon.

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:08.619
So they actually cut the tax, but they decided
to start enforcing it by stamping out smuggling.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:15.560
And to that end, the Act also gave British courts the right to try colonial smugglers, taking that power away from colonial courts,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.420
which had been notoriously lenient when it came to smuggling on account of how they enjoyed smuggled rum as much as the next guy.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:27.100
But those initial acts weren’t nearly as
annoying as the Stamp Act passed in 1765.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.940
The Stamp Act declared that all printed material
had to carry a stamp.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.580
Unsurprisingly, that stamp was not free.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.040
This was purely to gain revenue for Britain, and it mostly affected people who used a lot of paper.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.760
You know, like newspaper printers and lawyers.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.440
Just the kind of people you want to anger
about taxes!

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.200
So in October, protesters organized the Stamp Act Congress, which after a meeting, decided to boycott British goods.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.380
And this was the first major coordinated action by the colonies together, and it might be the first time that we can speak of the colonies acting in a united way.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.480
Almost like, say, a government.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:08.480
Committees of correspondence, which had been created to encourage opposition to earlier acts, now grew to coordinate the boycott efforts, and they helped people become aware of their "liberties."

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.920
And they also spurred street actions that
occasionally became violent.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.040
These direct actions were organized by groups calling themselves the Sons of Liberty, and guess what?

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.180
Coordinated action worked!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.400
The British Parliament repealed the Stamp Act, but they did pass the Declaratory Act which was all like,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.900
“Listen, you’re not the boss of us.
We can tax you.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.500
We don’t want to tax you right now as it
happens, but we could if we wanted to.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.739
But we won’t, but we could!”

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:36.700
So the repeal of the Stamp Act was seen by many in the colonies as a huge victory, but most of the people organizing the protests were elites.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.449
You know, the kind of people who use paper.

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:42.649
But once you start talking about the idea
of representation, everybody wants in.

00:03:42.649 --> 00:03:49.260
Meanwhile, Great Britain still needed money, so Chancellor of the Exchequer Charles Townshend got Parliament to pass new taxes in 1767.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.280
The so called “Townshend Acts” also created a new board of customs to stop smuggling which we didn’t like one bit.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.520
You don’t like it when I say we?
Well tough luck, I’m an American.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.360
Bring back the libertage, Stan!

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.000
[Patriotic Rock Music]

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.460
Many colonists again responded with a boycott, and women got in on the act this time, with the Daughters of Liberty, encouraging homespun clothes to replace British ones.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.400
But not all the states were on board, like artisans loved the boycotts because they got more money.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:22.260
But merchants from cities like Philadelphia and New York weren’t so happy, because they made their livings by importing and selling the very goods that were now being boycotted.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:32.040
On occasion, protests did get out of hand as in the Boston Massacre of March 5, 1770, which, while it was not much of a massacre, was definitely the worst outcome of a snowball fight in American history.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.880
I mean five colonists were killed, including most famously Crispus Attucks, a sailor of mixed race ancestry.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:44.620
And then of the nine British soldiers put on trial, 7 were acquitted and 2 were convicted only of manslaughter, thanks to the top-notch lawyering of one John Adams.

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.690
Don’t worry though, that guy comes around
to the American cause.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:53.330
But overall boycotts and protests were effective, and British merchants pushed for the repeal of these acts, leaving only a tax on tea.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.680
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:05.420
The 1773 Tea Act offered tax exemptions and rebates for tea coming in from the British-East India Company, which allowed them to dump cheap tea on the colonies, which actually lowered the price of tea.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:15.440
So why were the colonists so mad that on December 16, 1773 they dressed up as Indians and dumped enough tea into Boston Harbor to cause the modern equivalent of a $4,000,000 loss?

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.700
Some colonists were upset that cheap tea would cut into the profits of smugglers and established tea merchants, but most were just angry on principle.

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:28.160
To our great national shame, tea was at the time as important a beverage in the colonies as it was to Brits living in Britain,

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.720
and to allow the British to tax a near universal product set a precedent that Britain could tax whatever they wanted.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.780
But the tea partiers miscalculated, thinking that the British would back down in response to their protest.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.600
Instead, the British responded by passing a series of acts that colonists came to call the “Intolerable Acts.”

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.700
The Massachusetts Government Act curtailed
self-government there.

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:52.980
The Quartering Act forced colonists to house British soldiers in their homes when ordered to.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:06:01.200
The Quebec Act extended the southern boundary of Quebec and granted religious toleration to Catholics, which was none too popular with the Great Awakening crowd, having recently awoken.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.140
The colonial response to these acts is really
the start of the American Revolution.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:13.880
First Massachusetts passed a set of resolutions calling for colonists to: one, disobey the Intolerable Acts, two, stop paying taxes, and three, prepare for war.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.900
And in September 1774, a group of delegates from 12 of the 13 colonies – Georgia! – met in Philadelphia to coordinate the resistance of the Intolerable Acts.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:33.220
This was the First Continental Congress, which in setting up the continental association to police the boycott and encourage domestic manufacturing, was the first real colony-wide government in British America.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.740
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So this sort of phenomenon is known by historians as kind of a big deal.

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:45.980
I mean coordinating action to achieve some end is what governments do, so it’s not an exaggeration to say that the First Continental Congress was the first government of America.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:54.900
You might even say that sending delegates to Philadelphia in 1774 was the first truly revolutionary act of the American Revolution, but it was not a call for independence.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:06.000
However, there was a change in attitude among many colonists because rather than seeing themselves as standing up for their rights as English people, they began to make claims based on abstract ideas about freedom and natural rights.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.480
In this respect, the Continental Congress was between worlds, because it justified its actions as liberties of free and natural-born subjects within the realm of England.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.500
But it also talked about immutable laws of nature.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:26.080
And this idea that all humans have certain rights derived from natural law has become a pretty big deal, not just in the United States, but also in the green lands of “not-America.”

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.840
I mean these days “human rights” is a
phrase that we bandy about with – Putin!

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:34.920
Do you show up every time the words “human rights” are mentioned to make sure that we’re talking about China and not you?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:41.800
And this brings me back to an important point: although we tend to equate the two, the American Revolution and the American War for Independence were not the same thing.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.651
I mean for one thing, the fighting started
15 months before the Declaration of Independence.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:51.280
For another, simply declaring independence does not make you an independent nation, as I will now demonstrate.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.560
I hereby declare this studio the independent
nation of John Green-sylvania!

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.940
Yeah, see nothing happened.

00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:09.300
The war between colonists and Britain began in 1775 – on April 19th to be exact – when fighting broke out between the British soldiers and Massachusetts militiamen, the minutemen, at Concord and Lexington.

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.180
Or Lexington and Concord, depending on whether
you live in Lexington or Concord.

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:18.140
This was the famous “shot heard around the world” immortalized in Longfellow’s poem "The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere."

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:27.360
So while the colonists actually lost the famous battle of Bunker Hill, which was technically fought on Breeds Hill, the British suffered such heavy casualties that soon thereafter they were forced to abandon Boston.

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.060
But then they got some revenge by taking over New York, which they held for most of the rest of the war.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.100
But in thinking about the war, it’s very important to understand that not all colonists were pro-independence.

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:45.880
Like elites in colonies like New York and Pennsylvania were very nervous about all this revolutionary fervor that was whipping up artisans and small-time farmers to think that they deserve to have say in the political process.

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:51.600
Oh it’s time for the Mystery Document?
Awesome, I love getting shocked.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.480
The rules here are simple: if I guess the author of the Mystery Document correctly, I do not get the shock pen.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.040
If I’m wrong, I do get the shock pen.

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.980
All right, let’s see what we got here.
[clears throat]

00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:05.240
"The Americans are properly Britons.

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:10.160
They have the manners, habits, and ideas of Britons; and have been accustomed to a similar form of government.

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:14.800
But Britons could never bear the extremes,
either of monarchy or republicanism.

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:18.060
Some of their kings have aimed at despotism;
but always failed.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.020
Repeated efforts have been made towards democracy,
and they equally failed.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:32.800
If we may judge of future events by past transactions, in similar circumstances, this would most probably be the case in America, were a republican form of government adopted in our present ferment."

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.920
Hmm.

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:44.140
All right, so we’ve got an educated person who thinks that Americans are Britons who will inevitably want to walk a middle path between republicanism and monarchy and therefore that the revolution is not a good idea.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.340
I know it’s a colonist, because of the reference
to “our present ferment.”

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.460
All right, I’m going to guess that it is
Ben Franklin’s son William Franklin.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.100
[Buzzing Noise]
Ahhh! Dang it! Who is it?

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:58.320
Who the hell is Charles Ingles?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.040
Charles Ingles?
Charles freaking Ingles?

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.500
I’ve never even heard of that guy! It’s not fair!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:07.680
[Sigh] [Shock Noise]
Ahh! Oh I hate that.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.480
Apparently he’s a bishop or something.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.340
Anyway, people like Ingles reminds us that not everyone in the colonies was all fired up to be an independent nation.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:25.620
In fact, in July of 1775, the Continental Congress sent the Olive Branch Petition to King George III suggesting that Americans were loyal British subjects who wanted reconciliation with the mother country.

00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.620
But then along came Thomas Paine’s pamphlet
Common Sense.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.240
Why couldn’t that have been the Mystery
Document?

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:36.580
Common Sense appeared in January of 1776 and it was like the Harry Potter of its time, only with liberty instead of wizard school.

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.120
Written in relatively straightforward English, the pamphlet contains many powerful rhetorical arguments like:

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:47.700
“of more worth is one honest man to society and in the sight of God than all the crowned ruffians that ever lived.”

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:50.380
Others were just common sense, like this nugget:

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:55.940
“There is something absurd in supposing a continent
to be perpetually governed by an island.”

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:56.760
Pow!

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.160
Also there is the beautiful sentiment: "The
weapon we have is love.”

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.660
Oh that’s from Harry Potter?
I told you they were similar.

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:07.760
Ultimately Paine’s arguments all contributed to the idea that America is somehow special, even exceptional.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.540
I mean, talking about independence and freedom he said, “The cause of America is in great measure: the cause of all mankind.”

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.540
That’s powerful stuff, and Paine’s pamphlets sold 150 thousand copies, and it was extremely widely read.

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:24.620
By the way, he still managed to die penniless, and only 8 people attended his funeral because of his vitriolic ridicule of Christianity.

00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:30.560
But anyway America eventually declared independence for many reasons, but Paine’s persuasive arguments were one important reason.

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.220
And it marks a moment when the pen truly was, if not more powerful, then at least more important, than the sword.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:44.700
I mean, within 6 months of the publication of Common Sense, the Second Continental Congress had declared independence and signed one of the most important documents in the history of the world.

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.940
Which is where we’ll pick up next week.
