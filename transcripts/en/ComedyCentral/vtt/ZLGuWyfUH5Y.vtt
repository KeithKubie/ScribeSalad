TODAY WE'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT LEWIS AND CLARK.

00:00:12.112 --> 00:00:14.448 line:0%
 
- SO THOMAS JEFFERSON
WAS PRESIDENT.

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.149 line:0%
 
HE'S, LIKE, YEAH,
I'M GONNA TAKE--

00:00:16.183 --> 00:00:19.586 line:0%
 
I'M GONNA DOUBLE THE EXPANSE
OF AMERICA.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.321
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S OUT THERE.
- YEAH.

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:22.556
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- WELL, WHAT IS OUT THERE?

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:23.957
- I'M GONNA BUY IT.
I'M GONNA BUY IT.

00:00:23.991 --> 00:00:27.227
SO HE BOUGHT IT, AND THEN HE HAD
THIS DUDE WHO WAS HIS FRIEND

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.829
NAMED...
- MERIWETHER LEWIS

00:00:28.862 --> 00:00:31.732
- JEFFERSON IS TELLING THEM...
- WE BOUGHT THIS LAND.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.834
EXPLORE IT.
MAKE ME A MAP.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.202
HERE'S YOUR DEAL.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.505
- LIKE A BANK, MAKE FRIENDS
WITH THE [bleep] INDIANS.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:41.008
- HERE'S THE DEAL
WITH MERIWETHER LEWIS, THOUGH...

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.676
HE WAS SUCH A BUMMER--
- [belches]

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:45.245
- HE WAS SUCH A BUMMER.
- HE WAS SUCH A BUMMER.

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:48.482
SO LEWIS IS TASKED
WITH PICKING A PARTNER,

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.684
AND HE PICKED CLARK.

00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:52.219
UH, LEWIS SAYS, LIKE...

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.721
- THERE'S NO ONE
I WOULD RATHER EXPLORE

00:00:54.755 --> 00:00:57.991
THIS [bleep] UP TERRITORY WITH
THAN YOU.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.627
THEY WANTED TO FIND
A WATERWAY PASSAGE

00:01:00.661 --> 00:01:02.062
TO THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

00:01:02.062 --> 00:01:04.264
SO THEY STARTED
IN MISSOURI.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.066
- THEY'RE SEEING THESE
BEAUTIFUL [bleep]...

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.535
- LIKE, VALLEYS AND RIVERS
AND MOUNTAINS

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.438
AND GORGEOUS ROCK FACES
AND VALLEYS,

00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.576
AND THESE CRAZY PLAINS
THAT GO ON FOREVER.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.077
- AND THERE THEY [bleep] ARE.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.446
SO THEY WERE, LIKE...
- WE'RE--THIS IS OURS NOW

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.648
BECAUSE WE BOUGHT IT
FROM THE [bleep] FRENCH.

00:01:21.682 --> 00:01:24.785
- SO THEY'RE ON THE RIVER,
AND THEY HEAR...

00:01:24.818 --> 00:01:26.854
- THE NEXT TRIBE OVER

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.856
- THEY'RE--DUDE.
THEY'RE TOTAL DICKS.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:30.557
I REMEMBER THIS, YEAH.

00:01:30.591 --> 00:01:33.160 line:0%
 
- THE LAKOTA INDRIANS
SAW LEWIS AND CLARK,

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:34.695 line:0%
 
AND THEY WERE READY
TO KILL THEM.

00:01:34.728 --> 00:01:35.896
THEY WERE, LIKE...

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.798
- WE'RE GONNA [bleep]
YOUR [bleep] UP.

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.299
- SO THEY WERE, LIKE...
- OH, WE MIGHT NEED

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.468
TO BE DICKS ABOUT THIS.

00:01:41.502 --> 00:01:45.973
- THE CHIEF OF THE LAKOTA TRIBE
SEES THAT IT'S ABOUT TO BE

00:01:46.006 --> 00:01:48.475
A STAB-ON-STAB BRAWL
AT THE RIVERBANK,

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.477
AND HE SAYS...
- EVERYONE CHILL OUT.

00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:52.179
CHILL OUT.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:55.282
YOU GUYS CAN STAY, AS LONG AS
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

00:01:55.315 --> 00:01:56.783
COME AND LOOK AT YOU.

00:01:56.817 --> 00:01:59.953
- EWW, THAT'S CREEPY.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:01.188
- THEY WERE ABLE TO STAY
WITH THE LAKOTA TRIBE

00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:02.890
FOR ALMOST TWO WEEKS.
[tribal music]

00:02:02.923 --> 00:02:05.592
AND SO EACH
OF LEWIS AND CLARK'S MEN

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:06.860
GOT, LIKE, FOUR WIVES.

00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:08.896
LATER DAYS,
I'M GONNA GO CHECK OUT THESE--

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.631
- LIKE, HOOKERS.

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:13.967

EVERYONE ON THE EXPEDITION,

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:16.236
THEY GOT [bleep]
CRAZY STDs.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.272
- CRAZY VD.
AND LEWIS...

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:20.641
HE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE THEM
A MERCURY TONIC.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:24.178
- MERCURY ON YOUR GENITALS!
COME ON!

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.079
- IT'S CRAZY-POISONOUS!

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.915
- I DON'T MEAN TO,
LIKE, COMPLAIN,

00:02:27.948 --> 00:02:29.716
BUT THAT SOUNDS AWFUL.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.816
