00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.800
Water was in short supply in England during
the summer of 1976.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.550
Officials understood as early as September
1975 that water levels would be low the next

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:25.460
year thanks to 1975 being the fifth driest
year of the 20th century in the region.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.439
While an average of 278 millimeters, or nearly
11 inches, of rain fell on England between

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.700
May and August from 1916 all the way through
1950, only 140 millimeters or about 5.5 inches

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.730
of rain fell during the same time period in
1976.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.440
The months between April 1975 and August 1976
ultimately marked the driest period for the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.339
region in recorded history, with data going
back well over two centuries.

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.319
If the dry weather wasn’t bad enough, abnormally
high temperatures made a bad problem even

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:00.670
worse.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.080
Temperatures soared in the early summer, reaching
daily highs over 32 degrees Celsius, or nearly

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.940
90 degrees Fahrenheit for a record 15 consecutive
days from June 23rd to July 7th with the surrounding

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.340
weeks also being much hotter than normal.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.180
For a country not only running short of water,
but also largely without air conditioning,

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.760
the whole thing was a sweaty mess.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.659
Ladybirds, also known as ladybugs, flourished
in the dry conditions.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.630
(See: The Fascinating Reason Ladybugs are
Called That) Martin Wainwright lived through

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.790
the drought in 1976 and described the immense
number of the insects:

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.210
No one had ever seen so many ladybirds – a
colleague remembers the sound they made when

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.600
you walked on them – crunch, crunch, crunch!
– and the absence of green on the ground

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.020
was made up for in the air by apocalyptic
swarms of aphids [ladybirds].

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.619
1976-2The English government used just about
every method available–leaflets, newspapers,

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.970
radio, television, and road signs— to encourage
limiting water use to only what was absolutely

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.030
necessary.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.250
Most considered owning a dirty car during
this time to be downright patriotic.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.530
People were encouraged to use no more than
five inches of water when taking a bath.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.980
One television personality showered live on
television to show viewers how much water

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.610
could be saved with a quick shower as opposed
to a bath.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.519
(Showering being fairly uncommon for people
at the time.)

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.630
But if a person decided to take a bath, the
government and national newspapers like the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.890
Times and the Sun had helpful hints so as
not to waste the used water.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.690
For instance, at one point the government
suggested “Save water, bath with a friend”,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.370
which was soon a slogan that found its way
onto T-shirts, bumper stickers, and other

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.730
such product across the nation.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.400
Newspapers encouraged readers to reuse old
bath water by using it to water plants in

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.690
their gardens or dumping it into toilets in
order to use it to flush with.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.480
droughtWater became so scarce that water companies
could no longer supply tap water to certain

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.660
areas in Wales and England.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.610
They instead installed standpipes, upright
and freestanding metal pipes with a tap, for

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.019
residents to get needed drinking water.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.739
The use of hoses was also banned in some areas
with cars patrolling neighborhoods looking

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.560
for offenders, ready to hand out a steep fine
up to £400.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.129
Officials’ big fear was the impact of the
drought on the economy.

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.940
Businesses in industries that used a significant
amount of water warned that forcing compliance

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.731
with water restrictions would lead to a decrease
in work for their employees and fear of a

00:03:25.731 --> 00:03:27.150
three day work week.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.980
While businesses certainly felt the squeeze
from the drought, such as seaweed processing

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:37.049
plant forced to lay off all of its 125 workers
when the nearby reservoir dried up, others

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.420
rose to the challenge.

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.800
Breweries across the country claimed to have
reduced their water use by between 14% and

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.970
25%.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.239
One food production company reported cutting
down on their water use by 90% simply by changing

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:51.880
how they cleaned bottles.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.930
Despite the water restrictions and the fears
of how they would hurt workers, English citizens

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.970
did not see much of a change in the unemployment
rate as a result of the extreme drought.

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.829
Water restrictions also applied to sporting
facilities, such as horse race tracks, golf

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.569
courses, and rugby fields.

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.650
Those locations that decided not to abide
by the rules and watered their grass anyway

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.439
faced repercussions from busybody neighbors.

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.720
For instance, women in Surrey took issue with
a local golf course and its groundskeepers

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.120
who decided to water the greens to keep them
abiding by their name, despite the restrictions.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.090
They staged sit-ins at the course, even staying
overnight to make sure the sprinklers never

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.310
turned on, as well as harassed the club’s
employees.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.280
Their methods worked, and the golf course
stopped watering its grass.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.031
drough3Politicians passed legislation known
as the Drought Act in early August to help

00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:37.310
curb water usage.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.810
They also formed a Cabinet Drought Committee
to make recommendations on how best to get

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.710
the country through the ordeal.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.140
Prime Minister Jim Callaghan even appointed
his sports minister, Denis Howell, to the

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:52.780
position of “Drought Supremo,” in charge
of coordinating water conservation efforts;

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.870
it was joked that Howell must have really
got on the wrong side of Callaghan to be given

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:02.050
such a position that was virtually guaranteed
to make sure nobody in the public liked him.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.150
Beyond many suggestions, like putting a brick
in one’s toilet tank to reduce the water

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.280
used in a flush, Howell warned citizens the
water restrictions would be in place until

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.020
at least December.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.150
But within days of the Drought Act being passed,
it rained during the August Bank Holiday.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:23.440
At first just a trickle, ultimately the rainfall
began to ramp up into September and October,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.139
with the following year being abnormally wet.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.860
Howell soon became extremely unpopular due
to continuing to try to enforce restrictions

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.240
despite the heavy rainfall, sensibly wanting
to get the reservoir levels back to normal

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.620
before easing up on restrictions; for his
diligence to his duty, he was ultimately derisively

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:55.819
dubbed the ‘minister of the floods’.
