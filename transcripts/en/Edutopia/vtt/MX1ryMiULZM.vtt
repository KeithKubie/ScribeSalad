00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:13.536
&gt;&gt;Narrator: On the Kona Coast
of the big island of Hawaii,

00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:16.196
there's a ramshackle
collection of fish tanks,

00:00:16.296 --> 00:00:19.206
pipes and mobile housing
units that looks more

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.166
like a laboratory than a school.

00:00:21.196 --> 00:00:24.726
The ambiance is appropriate,
because there's a bold experiment

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:26.216
in education underway here.

00:00:26.216 --> 00:00:28.246
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I need student
helper to be in charge of this

00:00:28.246 --> 00:00:30.486
to help me put the packets together.

00:00:30.546 --> 00:00:33.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead of taking
biology, history and math,

00:00:33.426 --> 00:00:35.746
these high school students
spend the school day working

00:00:35.746 --> 00:00:38.266
on various projects that
encompass everything

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:44.256
from restoring ancient fish ponds,
to surveying reef ecosystems,

00:00:45.496 --> 00:00:50.726
to building exotic electric
vehicles and racing them.

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:54.576
Opened in the Year 2000 as an
alternative public high school

00:00:54.646 --> 00:00:58.596
for tenth through twelfth grade, the
West Hawaii Explorations Academy,

00:00:58.656 --> 00:01:03.206
or WHEA reflects the educational
philosophy of Principal Bill Woerner.

00:01:03.776 --> 00:01:06.446
&gt;&gt;Bill: Education is not a
collection of information.

00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:10.196
Education is being able to
function well in a society.

00:01:10.346 --> 00:01:14.266
These students function really
well, because they've learned how

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:17.196
to operate on small
teams, and to lay out how

00:01:17.196 --> 00:01:20.416
to solve complicated
problems in a reasonable way.

00:01:20.416 --> 00:01:21.156
&gt;&gt; Like two, three, four, five.

00:01:21.646 --> 00:01:22.946
&gt;&gt; Any color, or white?

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:24.776
&gt;&gt;Bill: The little
pieces and snippets

00:01:24.776 --> 00:01:28.996
of information they might get along
the way, that's sort of irrelevant,

00:01:28.996 --> 00:01:30.646
that's the risk that they work with.

00:01:31.116 --> 00:01:33.786
But the structure of how
you go about learning

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:36.986
and being a lifelong learner,
those are the things that, I think,

00:01:37.106 --> 00:01:38.576
this program does very well.

00:01:39.076 --> 00:01:41.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [speaking
foreign language]

00:01:42.226 --> 00:01:45.816
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Williams 130 students
receive some traditional instruction

00:01:45.816 --> 00:01:48.166
in math, reading, writing
and language arts.

00:01:48.906 --> 00:01:52.306
But they earn most of the credit
for their core subjects by managing

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:54.196
and staffing a variety of projects.

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:58.246
They develop their own research
parameters, conduct online research.

00:01:58.496 --> 00:01:59.786
And consult with mentors.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.906
&gt;&gt;Student: To take sea
water, you have to bleach it,

00:02:01.906 --> 00:02:05.676
then you have to add the sodium
phosphate, and neutralize it.

00:02:05.676 --> 00:02:08.116
And then you can put the
algae in and grow it.

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:09.026
So it says...

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:11.026
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They review
their evidence portfolios

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:13.796
with their teachers each
week, and make a final written

00:02:13.796 --> 00:02:17.146
and oral presentation of their
findings at the end of the semester.

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:19.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And see if you
can find the contact for him.

00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:23.126
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While the
environment is at times chaotic,

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:26.916
some researchers insist that
WHEA's approach is effective.

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:30.686
&gt;&gt;Nina: I have done research
that led me to believe

00:02:30.776 --> 00:02:35.436
that the important parts
of education are number one

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:38.676
that people have choice and
control over their own learning.

00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:44.046
And number two that they're in
a collaborative environment.

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:47.826
And thirdly, that kids are
engaged in content worth knowing.

00:02:47.986 --> 00:02:49.156
&gt;&gt;Student: Now let it sit here.

00:02:50.106 --> 00:02:52.946
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These WHEA students
are restoring an ancient fish pond,

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:56.916
a project that combines
anthropology, ecology, biology,

00:02:57.026 --> 00:02:59.026
community service, and manual labor.

00:02:59.026 --> 00:03:03.106
&gt;&gt;Student: It's an old ancient
incline pond from back in the day

00:03:03.106 --> 00:03:05.946
when Kamehameha ruled
the Hawaiian Islands.

00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:10.826
And this was one of his personal
ponds that used to hold fish in.

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:14.106
This is where he got much of
his fish supply for eating,

00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:18.266
and guppies were introduced
a long time ago,

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:21.596
and they've overrun the pond.

00:03:22.506 --> 00:03:24.096
And we're trying to restore the pond

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:26.526
to its natural state,
which is pristine.

00:03:28.306 --> 00:03:30.576
&gt;&gt;Student: Cleaning out this
pond is really important.

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:36.166
it's really important to show the
children of the future how back

00:03:36.166 --> 00:03:39.596
in the past that these
ponds were used.

00:03:39.596 --> 00:03:43.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: He's been moved around
all day, so he's hiding in there.

00:03:43.186 --> 00:03:46.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The projects WHEA
students participate in are as varied

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:49.216
as the imagination of the
students who design them.

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:51.586
But most have a public
service aspect,

00:03:51.706 --> 00:03:55.326
like this ecology education
program for primary school kids.

00:03:55.326 --> 00:03:56.926
&gt;&gt; C'mon, I can't breathe well.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:04:00.076
&gt;&gt; She is so frightened because
she can't have a trouble-free...

00:04:00.076 --> 00:04:01.436
&gt;&gt; What a cruel world!

00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:03.256
Someone please help me!

00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:05.026
&gt;&gt; What if don't want to?

00:04:05.086 --> 00:04:06.426
I guess I could try.

00:04:06.596 --> 00:04:08.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: For new teachers
like Shari Harada-Shrai,

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:11.886
WHEA's project-based
learning approach offers an

00:04:11.886 --> 00:04:13.126
exciting challenge.

00:04:13.126 --> 00:04:16.316
&gt;&gt;Shari: If somebody told me when I
was student teaching that, you know,

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:18.846
ten months from now you're going
to be in the water snorkeling

00:04:18.846 --> 00:04:20.696
with your kids and
taking data and trying

00:04:20.696 --> 00:04:22.736
to explain this, I'd
be like, "No way!"

00:04:23.276 --> 00:04:25.286
&gt;&gt;Student: There's a lot of
different reasons to graph,

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:28.106
whether it's dwarfing
and that kind of stuff.

00:04:28.106 --> 00:04:29.046
&gt;&gt;Shari: And I'm learning
from my students.

00:04:29.046 --> 00:04:29.806
And that's the real gift.

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:33.676
When you model, and then you show
it to your other students that,

00:04:33.676 --> 00:04:34.776
"You know, I'm a learner, too.

00:04:34.776 --> 00:04:36.206
Not only a teacher, I'm a learner.

00:04:36.206 --> 00:04:37.406
And I love to learn."

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:40.676
Then everybody's just in a
whole learning community.

00:04:40.676 --> 00:04:41.586
[laughs]

00:04:41.586 --> 00:04:43.746
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The learning
community at WHEA ranges

00:04:43.746 --> 00:04:45.806
from special ed to gifted.

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.976
and the project approach
seems to work well

00:04:47.976 --> 00:04:49.396
at both ends of the spectrum.

00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:50.936
&gt;&gt;Shari: This one particular student,

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:53.906
she decided that she wanted
to try this school out.

00:04:54.096 --> 00:04:57.876
And at the first semester, she
just-- paperwork would come in,

00:04:58.076 --> 00:05:02.596
but it was real sloppy, no
effort, hardly any journals.

00:05:02.596 --> 00:05:05.666
&gt;&gt; Put numbers inside the tank, so
it's like one, two, three, four.

00:05:05.866 --> 00:05:09.286
&gt;&gt;Shari: The second semester,
she has turned in everything.

00:05:09.696 --> 00:05:11.826
From a research paper
to a literary critique,

00:05:12.186 --> 00:05:15.066
to her evidence folder,
weekly paperwork.

00:05:15.476 --> 00:05:18.436
Always asking me and
inquiring for help.

00:05:18.686 --> 00:05:22.906
You know, just the whole motivation
turnaround is total and complete.

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:24.826
And she keeps telling me,
"Thank you, thank you.

00:05:24.826 --> 00:05:25.276
I love you."

00:05:25.276 --> 00:05:27.116
And I said, "No, thank yourself.

00:05:27.636 --> 00:05:32.746
You did it, you pushed yourself."

00:05:33.176 --> 00:05:35.646
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The WHEA staff
has developed partnerships

00:05:35.646 --> 00:05:37.736
with local companies, universities

00:05:37.736 --> 00:05:41.206
and community organizations
recruiting project mentors

00:05:41.306 --> 00:05:45.076
and opening up career opportunities
for students like Jared Willeford,

00:05:45.356 --> 00:05:48.656
who landed a job at a
nearby microalgae farm.

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:51.476
&gt;&gt;Jared: I was really interested
in what they were doing,

00:05:51.476 --> 00:05:54.106
and I caught on really fast,
so they kind of integrated me

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:57.696
into the process, and now I'm getting
paid, and I'm moving up the field,

00:05:57.866 --> 00:06:00.906
so I'll be a technician pretty soon.

00:06:00.906 --> 00:06:02.656
In the future, maybe
if I can get a farm,

00:06:02.656 --> 00:06:05.446
and I've already learned all the
different fertilization methods,

00:06:05.586 --> 00:06:09.346
and things such as that, so I
could set up my own system and kind

00:06:09.346 --> 00:06:11.506
of live off my own stuff, you know?

00:06:11.916 --> 00:06:12.976
Pretty much live off
of what I've learned.

00:06:24.316 --> 00:06:26.356
&gt;&gt;Mentor: Notice how they have
those spot patterns on their back?

00:06:26.756 --> 00:06:29.126
That's totally unique.

00:06:29.126 --> 00:06:32.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Mentors play a key
role in many WHEA projects.

00:06:32.536 --> 00:06:35.436
Erin Rletow has been
studying water quality issues,

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:38.156
working with the staff at
the Four Seasons Resort.

00:06:38.476 --> 00:06:41.176
&gt;&gt;Mentor: We do a salinity test.

00:06:41.176 --> 00:06:45.526
&gt;&gt;Erin: Got about a 26;
How come it's so low?

00:06:45.756 --> 00:06:47.586
&gt;&gt;Mentor: Well, it's low
as compared with the ocean,

00:06:47.586 --> 00:06:50.696
which is about 34-35 parts per
thousand, but we keep it low

00:06:50.696 --> 00:06:53.426
like that so that the
fish can't reproduce.

00:06:54.696 --> 00:06:57.076
&gt;&gt;Erin: Compared to
books, magazines, articles,

00:06:57.526 --> 00:06:59.526
working with mentors has
been my biggest source

00:06:59.526 --> 00:07:01.936
of information all
throughout the three years

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:02.926
that I've been at the school.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:08.246
And not only can you ask direct
questions, and they can answer them,

00:07:08.296 --> 00:07:11.396
but they also give you more
than what you asked for.

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:12.886
&gt;&gt;Mentor: The lone
female, she's the biggest.

00:07:13.606 --> 00:07:15.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Erin has been
conducting an experiment

00:07:15.456 --> 00:07:18.886
for the past three years on a
brackish water pond at the resort

00:07:18.976 --> 00:07:22.406
to see if the introduction of
bacteria will improve water quality.

00:07:23.206 --> 00:07:25.106
&gt;&gt;Erin: I love what I do [laughs]

00:07:25.336 --> 00:07:28.556
and it's really exciting,
and it feels good!

00:07:28.556 --> 00:07:33.826
Instead of-- compared to being where
I was before, sitting in a classroom,

00:07:34.936 --> 00:07:37.176
four walls, lights, textbooks, desks.

00:07:38.336 --> 00:07:41.396
This is my classroom now
,this is where I learn.

00:07:43.286 --> 00:07:45.596
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Part of the learning
process is demonstrating what

00:07:45.596 --> 00:07:46.566
you know.

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:50.106
For Erin, that meant presenting
her research findings to a panel

00:07:50.106 --> 00:07:53.186
of graduate students at the
University of Hawaii on Oahu.

00:07:53.186 --> 00:07:57.586
&gt;&gt;Erin: For those of you who
aren't sure what incline pools are,

00:07:58.006 --> 00:08:02.336
they're pretty much
landlocked brackish water ponds.

00:08:02.736 --> 00:08:05.726
There's three characteristics
that really define a pool.

00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:09.066
&gt;&gt;Erin: If you want to excel
and you want to push yourself,

00:08:09.686 --> 00:08:12.406
there isn't any class
in a public school

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:14.806
that could give you what
you can give yourself,

00:08:15.056 --> 00:08:19.036
and that's what the greatest
thing is is because it's all you.

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:24.406
I'm so blessed to have been able
to go to this school, it's great.

00:08:29.506 --> 00:08:31.526
