00:00:00.637 --> 00:00:02.720
In this video we're going
to do with the hyperbola

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.350
the exact same thing
we did with the circle.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.030
We're going to find
constraints on the y-intercept

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.072
for the tangent
line in terms of m.

00:00:11.072 --> 00:00:13.030
But this time we're going
to use the hyperbola.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.904
And then we can set them
equal to each other,

00:00:14.904 --> 00:00:16.530
and solve for the m.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.880
So let's remind ourselves what
the equation of the hyperbola

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:20.740
is.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.239
They give it to us
right over there.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.930
It's x squared over 9 minus y
squared over 4 is equal to 1.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:27.470
Let me write this over here.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.040
So it is x squared over
9 minus y squared over 4

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.100
is equal to-- I'll
write the y squared--

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.100
minus y squared over
4 is equal to 1.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.360
But now we can
substitute the y squared

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.530
with the y is equal
to mx plus b that we

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.620
got from the last video.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.010
And we actually figured out
what y squared is equal to.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.100
Y squared is equal to all
of this business up here.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.280
Because it's the same line.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.790
Remember, this is the
whole point of it.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.081
We're trying to find two
constraints on that same line.

00:00:58.081 --> 00:00:59.842
So we can rewrite
this same thing.

00:00:59.842 --> 00:01:01.300
And actually one
thing I want to do

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.466
is I'm going to multiply
both sides of this equation

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.270
by 36, the common
multiple of 9 and 4,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.230
so that I can get rid
of these fractions.

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:14.000
And so this is going to become
36-- let me write it this way--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.690
so 36 divided by 9 is 4.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.820
So it's 4x squared minus--
36 divided by 4 is 9--

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.660
and I would put a y
squared here but we

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.550
know that y squared is
the exact same thing

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.120
as this thing over here.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.990
So y squared is the
same thing as m squared.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.000
x squared plus 2
mbx plus b squared.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.042
And then this is going to
be equal to-- remember,

00:01:42.042 --> 00:01:43.750
we multiplied both
sides of this equation

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.210
by 36-- so this is
going to be equal to 36.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.839
And let me simplify this.

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:52.630
And we're going to do
the exact same thing.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:02:00.340
We know that the m and
b have to be such that,

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.040
or the line has to have a slope
and y-intercept where it'll

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.390
only intersect with the
hyperbola at one point.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.410
It'll only have one solution to
this quadratic in terms of x.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.890
But let's simplify it first
before we worry about that.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:18.900
So this is equal to 4 x
squared minus 9 m squared

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:30.530
x squared minus 18
mbx, minus 9 b squared.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.650
Just multiply it there.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.730
And let me subtract
this 36 from both sides,

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.880
so then we have minus
36 is equal to 0.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.080
So this is a quadratic
in terms of x.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.600
But let me combine the
various degree terms.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.390
So these are the x squared
terms right over here.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:55.940
So this is the same thing as
4 minus 9 m squared times x

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:56.900
squared.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.460
And then our only x term
is this right over here.

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:01.800
That's our only x term.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.620
So this is minus 18 mbx.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.370
And then our constant
terms are right over here.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:18.260
So this over here is minus
9 b squared-- and let

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.230
me write it this way, let
me write it as minus 9--

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.842
well I'll just write it,
minus 9 b squared minus 36.

00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:30.050
I'll just write it like that.

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.710
And of course that is
going to be equal to 0.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.340
And remember, quadratic
formula, if we

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.840
wanted to solve for the Xs,
we'd have the quadratic formula,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.110
but we only want to
have one solution.

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.240
So the discriminant part
of the quadratic formula

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.150
is going to equal 0.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.230
The b squared minus 4 ac
is going to be equal to 0.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.790
This is exactly what we
did in the last video.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.876
So let's take the
b squared minus 4ac

00:03:49.876 --> 00:03:51.500
and set that equal
to 0, and then we'll

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.740
have our constraints on m and b.

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:59.985
So b squared is-- and
remember don't get the squared

00:03:59.985 --> 00:04:01.360
in the quadratic
formula confused

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.860
with the b in the y-intercept.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.120
But this term
squared is-- so this

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:11.870
is going to be-- 18 squared
m squared b squared, right?

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.250
Negative 18 squared
is just positive 18.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.416
Minus 4 times a.

00:04:17.416 --> 00:04:23.620
a is 4 minus 9 m
squared times c.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:38.197
So I can rewrite c as negative
9 times b squared plus 4.

00:04:38.197 --> 00:04:39.030
Did I do that right?

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.220
Negative 9 times b squared
is negative 9 b squared.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.200
Negative 9 times
4 is negative 36.

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.760
I want to make sure I don't
make any careless mistakes.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.950
And so this becomes--
so if we just

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.120
take the negative 9
and the negative 4--

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.620
they become a positive 36.

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:55.260
They become a positive 36.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.880
And then we can actually,
just to simplify things

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.270
so we don't have to do
too much fancy math,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.190
this 18 squared--
let's remember--

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.910
18 squared is the same
thing as-- well 18 squared

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.350
is going to be divisible--
well I won't worry too much

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:13.840
about that just yet.

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.600
I just want to make
sure that-- Actually

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.160
let me write it this way.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:23.560
So 18 squared is 2
times 9 times 2 times 9.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.280
Or another way to think about
it is 4 times 9 times 9.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.200
That's the same
thing as 18 squared.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.600
4 times 9 times 9.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.430
Now we can divide both of these
terms-- and this whole thing,

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.220
remember we want this whole
thing to be equal to 0.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.150
The discriminant has
to be equal to 0.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.430
So we can divide both
sides of this equation

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.540
by 36, which is the same thing
as dividing by 4 times 9.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.870
So this term right over here,
we could get rid of one 4

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.960
and one 4.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:03.750
And we're going to get a 9 m
squared b squared over here.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.250
And then we divided by
36, so these all go away.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.400
So it's going to be
9 m squared b squared

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.720
plus this thing
times this thing.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.530
So let's see what that is.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.100
So we have a 4
times a b squared.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.560
So we have plus 4 b squared.

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.190
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.490
I'll do it in blue.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:26.954
So plus 4 b squared.

00:06:26.954 --> 00:06:28.120
And then you have 4 times 4.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.000
So plus 16.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.500
And you have negative 9 m
squared times b squared.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.720
So it's negative 9
m squared b squared.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.710
And then you have negative
9 m squared times 4.

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.410
So negative 36 m squared.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.110
And that's going
to be equal to 0.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.980
Lucky for us, that
and that cancel out.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:55.252
And then we are
left with something.

00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:56.710
And actually, what
we're left with,

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.020
everything is divisible by 4.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.390
So let's divide what
we're left with by 4.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.790
So then we're left with b
squared-- that's that term.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.490
And then minus 9 m squared.

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.810
That's that term over there.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:14.580
Just divided it by 4.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:20.240
And then plus 4 is equal to 0.

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:23.852
And once again, we could
use-- well actually here,

00:07:23.852 --> 00:07:25.060
we don't have to do anything.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:26.160
We don't have to use
quadratic formula.

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:27.360
We could just solve for b.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.960
We could subtract
this from both sides.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:38.720
And so we'll get b squared
is equal to the square root

00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:50.280
of 9 m squared minus 4.

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:53.090
Sorry-- let me
just write this-- I

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:54.830
don't want to skip steps here.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:08:01.057
b squared is equal to
9 m squared minus 4.

00:08:01.057 --> 00:08:02.640
They're painting the
office right now,

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.400
so maybe it's making me a
little bit-- making my brain not

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:06.070
work properly.

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:11.790
Then b is equal to the square
root of 9 m squared minus 4.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.640
Did I do that right?

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:13.490
Let's see.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:14.820
I got the 4.

00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.044
Yeah, it looks right.

00:08:17.044 --> 00:08:18.710
And so we're left
with a situation where

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.770
the b-- if we're saying
that if the line is

00:08:20.770 --> 00:08:23.030
tangent to the
hyperbola it to be this,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:26.570
and if the line is
tangent to the circle b

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:30.855
has to be equal to this,
this business over here.

00:08:30.855 --> 00:08:35.630
So let me copy it and
then let me paste it.

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.480
Let me paste it.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.549
Just like that.

00:08:38.549 --> 00:08:40.950
And so we now have two
equations with two unknowns.

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:44.049
We can set these equal to
each other and solve for m.

00:08:44.049 --> 00:08:48.070
And this will give us the m or
the slope of that tangent line.

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:52.420
And then we can go
ahead and solve for b.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.790
I'll do that in the next video.
