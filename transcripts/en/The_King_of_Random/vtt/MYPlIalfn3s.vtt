00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:07.469
Hey guys for this video. I'm going to show you how to make [one] of my easiest desktop weapons yet

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.469
The mini RPG the materials for this product are so simple you may already have them lying around the house

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.850
You're just going to need some drinking straws a hot glue gun a pair of scissors and some of these pop snaps

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.260
Now the length of your drinking straw could be measured very easily by using some Lego blocks

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.229
I put them together in this pattern so we're six studs

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.660
Deep if you line your straw up and hold it with one finger

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.889
You can very easily cut off the end and we're going to be building some fins as well

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.669
We're going to need to make four cuts along the lines of the straw two studs deep

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.180
Now these don't have to be super precise

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.469
All you need are basically four flaps that will fold upward and form a cross like this

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.960
But they have a natural tendency to fold back and take the shape of the straw in so we need to heat treat them with

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.320
Something like a barbecue lighter

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.899
All you need to do is slowly lower from the top until you see the fins start to move downward

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.079
Then push your thumb up there and hold it for about three seconds

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.279
The heat helps reform the plastic and makes the fins very very springy now you probably know that these pockets come encased in

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:06.070
sawdust

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.000
that's because these little things are impact sensitive when they hit the ground they explode and that's because all they are are little bits of

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
Gravel covered with fulminated Mercury, which is a contact explosive

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.759
Spread your pop snaps on the table and give the sawdust a little blow

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.210
the inside of our straw is hollow and the pop snaps have these little streams that pop off the top so I like to put

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.509
Them down inside, and then just use a couple dabs of hot glue to secure them in place

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.460
Now they're fun to use like this you could just throw them like darts, and they will explode

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.140
But just to power things up a little bit

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.680
I went to the gas station and picked up a whole handful of straws now these straws

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.049
Come in all different sizes shapes and varieties

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.960
I found the bigger ones that are used for soda or pretty well

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.140
And here's how they work take your fins of your RPG and tuck [them] back into a straw shape and then slowly push them into

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.020
The end of the one of the straws so it tucks in nicely like that

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.089
These micro rPGs are only intended to be shot at little paper Targets and at my house

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.299
There's nothing scary than a Minecraft zombie or a creeper, so let's put them to the test

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.119
The coolest thing about these cartridges is they're reusable so after you snap one off

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:14.989
Go ahead and pull out the hot glue

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:19.119
Grab a new snap it add a little more hot glue to that reload it the exact same way

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.919
And while a straw is functional. It's not very cool. So let's power up once again to make a bona fide RPG launcher like this

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.139
Start at one Edge and gently roll the straw until it touches the entire strip of duct tape roll

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.449
It slowly and evenly just like that

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.640
We've got a digital camo Rocket launch or Tube

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.610
And if we snip the ends we can clean it up and make it look super professional

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.549
Next I'm going to use a little bit of electrical tape for aesthetics

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.039
We're going to put a strip of electrical tape on both ends

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.239
And then a couple more in the middle just for decoration and this one is going to be quite a bit thicker

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.699
That's just going to give us a little bit more of a 3D effect

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.389
So when I was at the gas station I also found these very small clear tubes

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.519
and if we take a strip of duct tape and wrap it around the clear Tube we can instantly turn it black and then with

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.849
A bit of an angled cut we can make the optical scope look pretty cool

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:14.379
While that's cooling, we can move on to making our handles and for that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.199
I'm just using a popsicle stick and a sharpie marker then we're going to cut off the tip I'd say about half an inch

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.069
Cut it up the middle

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.629
We color the center of it with the sharpie that will complete the handle for us

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.729
Once you press that in flip it over make sure everything's lined up symmetrically so that when it's upside down

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.239
It should look like a little shark fin with the scope hanging directly below it

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.220
So these things work exactly like they did before because it's literally the same straw just pinch the fins

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:45.160
Push it down into the rocket launcher Tube until the warhead rests against the tip now just grab the handles

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.769
Place it in your mouth [and] give it a quick burst of air

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.520
Now these things are pretty fun

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.829
but if you want to go to the extreme, you can get some of these

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:01.549
These are the adult version of Snappers and they contain ten times as much fulminated Mercury which means a much bigger explosion

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.240
These things load

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.450
Exactly the same way a little hot glue the straw goes on and the cool thing is they [are] the exact width that you need

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:14.659
To fit into one of these straws you can rest that flush, and they shoot out exactly the same way with a lot bigger bang

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.900
Wow, that's pretty cute

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.780
So there you have it guys the mini RPG an awesome project done with very simple materials someone that you can try it

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.160
Thanks for joining me for this project. I'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.940
Nailed it!

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.880
That was unexpected

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.560
*Laughter*
