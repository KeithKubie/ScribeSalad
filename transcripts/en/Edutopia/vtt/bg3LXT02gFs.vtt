00:00:08.856 --> 00:00:12.016
&gt;&gt;Student: This plan specifically
called for a transitional government

00:00:12.336 --> 00:00:16.126
which would govern Iraq until
the elections would be held

00:00:16.126 --> 00:00:17.836
in the summer 2005.

00:00:18.086 --> 00:00:22.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: This mock United Nations
caucus is part of the curriculum

00:00:22.216 --> 00:00:25.466
at ISA, the International
School of the Americas.

00:00:25.466 --> 00:00:26.976
&gt;&gt;Student: Every nation
in here would have a copy

00:00:26.976 --> 00:00:28.756
of the coalition's timeline.

00:00:28.866 --> 00:00:32.996
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At this magnet school in
San Antonio, Texas field trips begin

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:35.896
at the local museum, move
to the local mission,

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:39.656
and end in the interior of Mexico.

00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.746
&gt;&gt;Shari: We asked the question,
could we use our proximity

00:00:44.746 --> 00:00:47.946
to Mexico two hours away as an
international learning laboratory?

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.226
Could this become the
International School of the Americas

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:52.566
where kids were immersed
in global learning?

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:54.466
Could we do high schooling
differently?

00:00:55.076 --> 00:00:58.236
Could we create a place that
felt personal and involved

00:00:58.696 --> 00:01:00.976
where students' voice
was really important?

00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:03.416
&gt;&gt;Student: I think community
also plays a role almost bigger

00:01:03.416 --> 00:01:03.936
than religion.

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:08.116
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The ten-year ISA
experiment has succeeded thanks

00:01:08.116 --> 00:01:11.756
in large measure to the
imagination of its teaching staff.

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:14.516
&gt;&gt;Kathy: When we have a new idea and
we say "Hey, I have this crazy idea,

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:17.856
we want to take 120 students
to Mexico for six days."

00:01:18.126 --> 00:01:20.036
Many people would say
"What are you crazy?

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:21.126
We can't do that."

00:01:21.506 --> 00:01:23.416
And here that type of out-of-the-box,

00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:25.006
innovative thinking
is really encouraged.

00:01:25.416 --> 00:01:27.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: I think at this point
then, it's more important to get

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:31.236
as many ideas out on the table as
you can, so you got teen pregnancy-

00:01:31.386 --> 00:01:33.306
&gt;&gt;Kathy: We've get kids who are
looking for something different.

00:01:33.776 --> 00:01:36.296
Sometimes it's kids who want to be
more challenged more academically.

00:01:36.886 --> 00:01:39.666
Sometimes it's kids who
want a smaller environment.

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:41.346
&gt;&gt;So will you talk a little bit

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.036
about what you were trying
to show in this image?

00:01:43.146 --> 00:01:45.696
&gt;&gt;I think at this point
we've built this culture

00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:48.996
where it is cool to be academic.

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:52.426
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To build the school
culture teachers work in teams

00:01:52.426 --> 00:01:56.976
across disciplines doing whatever
it takes, even driving the bus.

00:01:57.696 --> 00:02:00.896
&gt;&gt;Kathy: Unfortunately taking field
trips is expensive and we have

00:02:00.896 --> 00:02:03.596
to pay our drivers and
it's very expensive.

00:02:03.816 --> 00:02:06.926
And so I went and got my bus driving
license as did several other members

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:09.916
of our staff so that when we go on
field trips I can drive the bus,

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:14.046
and then it doesn't
cost the kids anything.

00:02:14.046 --> 00:02:15.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At ISA every
field trip is a focused,

00:02:15.876 --> 00:02:17.856
interactive learning experience

00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:20.306
that links the classroom
with the outside world.

00:02:20.846 --> 00:02:23.376
&gt;&gt;Linda: These particular
masks were used for what?

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:26.126
&gt;&gt;Student: Religious purposes?

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:30.086
&gt;&gt;Linda: So much of what
you see, you learn from.

00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:32.576
On a trip out of the country
you learn every moment.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:36.656
If we can use that learning and
incorporate it into what we're trying

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:39.796
to do then it enriches what
we're doing in the classroom

00:02:39.796 --> 00:02:41.556
and it makes the experience
more whole.

00:02:42.296 --> 00:02:43.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: When we go to
Monterey I believe we're going

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:45.906
to go to the museum there.

00:02:45.906 --> 00:02:50.446
You're going to see many
portraits of monjas coronadas.

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:52.886
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ISA has become a
professional development school

00:02:52.886 --> 00:02:57.306
for nearby Trinity University giving
their student teachers a global

00:02:57.306 --> 00:02:58.496
perspective on learning.

00:02:58.736 --> 00:03:00.716
&gt;&gt;Student: The purpose was
it's like the focal point

00:03:00.986 --> 00:03:03.176
of the costume for a dance drama.

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:07.196
&gt;&gt;Angela: We're creating this
idea in our beginning teachers

00:03:07.196 --> 00:03:10.526
that you are a teacher not only
in the classroom but a teacher

00:03:10.526 --> 00:03:13.696
of the world, that you are
an expeditionary teacher

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:16.606
who takes students out into the
world to learn a little bit.

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:19.506
It's very intense, it's very
challenging to travel with students

00:03:19.756 --> 00:03:23.376
but the benefits curricularly,
intellectually, socially,

00:03:23.476 --> 00:03:24.856
emotionally, are immeasurable.

00:03:25.216 --> 00:03:28.886
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm Captain Kelly
Mason of the United States Navy,

00:03:29.316 --> 00:03:32.316
and I'm here today on leave to join
you today in this town meeting.

00:03:32.956 --> 00:03:35.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While a typical high
school American History lesson might

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:37.996
focus on dates, this turn

00:03:37.996 --> 00:03:42.996
of the century town meeting role
play teaches context and tolerance.

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:47.076
&gt;&gt;Student: We've been chosen by God
for greatness and it is our job,

00:03:47.076 --> 00:03:50.046
it is our duty and
our obligation to go

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:55.386
to these troubled heathen-filled
countries and teach the Word of God

00:03:55.386 --> 00:03:57.756
and to teach them how to be educated.

00:03:58.316 --> 00:04:00.396
&gt;&gt;Student: I think really
the economical standpoint

00:04:00.396 --> 00:04:03.056
and all the trading would be
what we'd have to focus on

00:04:03.056 --> 00:04:05.756
and not all the moral
standpoints because I don't know

00:04:05.756 --> 00:04:07.366
if that's really going to
help the United States.

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:10.566
&gt;&gt;John: The idea that they have
a voice that they're expected

00:04:10.676 --> 00:04:15.336
to vocalize for themselves, I
think encourages that ability

00:04:15.426 --> 00:04:17.796
to speak up, to be heard.

00:04:17.886 --> 00:04:19.066
&gt;&gt;Student: It's the same issue,

00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:20.906
different presidents,
different countries.

00:04:21.116 --> 00:04:24.896
&gt;&gt;John: And then I think the skill is
also developed to sit back and listen

00:04:24.896 --> 00:04:29.846
to others and not always have to be
in the forefront of what's going on.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:34.246
&gt;&gt;Student: A lot of my good
friends have totally different views

00:04:34.296 --> 00:04:34.846
than I do.

00:04:35.216 --> 00:04:42.376
And before I was just like I had no
idea like "Why would you think that?"

00:04:42.596 --> 00:04:46.526
But after this simulation and
past simulations that I've done,

00:04:46.796 --> 00:04:49.786
now I understand why they think
that way, even though I don't agree,

00:04:49.976 --> 00:04:50.966
at least I understand why.

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:53.796
&gt;&gt;Student: The coalition forces
have had a lot of problems

00:04:53.796 --> 00:04:56.136
with the Islamic militant
groups in Iraq.

00:04:56.716 --> 00:04:59.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To help students
understand and accept the views

00:04:59.196 --> 00:05:03.666
of people around the globe ISA
established a Model United Nations

00:05:03.736 --> 00:05:05.756
program sponsored by the city

00:05:05.756 --> 00:05:10.366
of San Antonio the group hosts an
annual convention and participates

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:12.886
in other Model U.N.
gatherings around the world.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:14.786
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: All those
wishing to speak to the pro,

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:18.086
please raise your placards:
China, United States.

00:05:19.136 --> 00:05:21.246
&gt;&gt;Russell: There is
intensive academic research.

00:05:21.676 --> 00:05:23.606
There is intense writing involved.

00:05:23.676 --> 00:05:26.846
There is important
interpersonal skills that kids have

00:05:26.846 --> 00:05:29.886
to really learn how to work with
each other in a diplomatic fashion

00:05:30.346 --> 00:05:35.126
and that's something that's not- does
not come natural to the teenager.

00:05:35.386 --> 00:05:38.886
&gt;&gt;Student: Motion unmoderated
caucus for ten minutes.

00:05:38.886 --> 00:05:41.696
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Every ISA sophomore
takes a class that prepares them

00:05:41.696 --> 00:05:43.256
to act as a country's delegate.

00:05:43.596 --> 00:05:44.286
&gt;&gt;Student: All closed.

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:45.956
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And some students elect

00:05:45.956 --> 00:05:48.156
to continue their Model
U.N. experience

00:05:48.236 --> 00:05:50.126
in a club that meets after school.

00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:52.066
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: So one
year I represented Iran

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:56.846
and Iran's official position at the
time was not my official position

00:05:57.006 --> 00:06:01.406
on women, I can tell you, so by
using Model United Nations as a tool,

00:06:01.406 --> 00:06:04.056
you can teach students
to take the position

00:06:04.056 --> 00:06:07.336
of a country whose views may
not necessarily be their own.

00:06:07.336 --> 00:06:08.816
&gt;&gt;Student: We need
to foster that idea

00:06:08.816 --> 00:06:10.596
of local government
at the root which-

00:06:10.596 --> 00:06:13.066
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: I've seen students
come out of their shells,

00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.876
learn to speak eloquently,
succinctly,

00:06:15.986 --> 00:06:20.336
and to think on their feet and
know when their ideas are good

00:06:20.336 --> 00:06:23.086
and should be heard and know when to
shut their mouths which is something

00:06:23.086 --> 00:06:24.606
that real professionals
need to do sometimes.

00:06:24.986 --> 00:06:27.366
&gt;&gt;Student: The United States
considering the topic we're here

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.346
to debate doesn't feel the
need to answer that question.

00:06:29.876 --> 00:06:31.956
&gt;&gt;Shari: I think they graduate
with an emotional intelligence

00:06:32.136 --> 00:06:34.586
and that's really important
for success in our world today.

00:06:35.206 --> 00:06:38.536
They're very savvy at understanding
group dynamics and I think that's one

00:06:38.536 --> 00:06:40.086
of the most important
gifts they walk away with.

00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.096
I think they also walk
away as learners.

00:06:42.286 --> 00:06:46.636
It is very cool to be smart
here, and our students walk

00:06:46.886 --> 00:06:49.466
out the door believing that.

00:06:49.566 --> 00:06:51.526
