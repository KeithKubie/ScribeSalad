00:00:00.141 --> 00:00:01.473
- [Voiceover] Let's
see if we can take this

00:00:01.473 --> 00:00:05.351
quadratic expression here, X
squared plus 16 X plus nine

00:00:05.351 --> 00:00:07.091
and write it in this form.

00:00:07.091 --> 00:00:08.021
You might be saying, hey Sal,

00:00:08.021 --> 00:00:10.485
why do I even need to worry about this?

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:12.900
And one, it is just
good algebraic practice

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.386
to be able to manipulate things,

00:00:14.386 --> 00:00:16.661
but as we'll see in the
future, what we're about to do

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.798
is called completing the square.

00:00:18.798 --> 00:00:21.525
It's a really valuable
technique for solving quadratics

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.475
and it's actually the basis for the proof

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:26.725
of the quadratic formula which
you'll learn in the future.

00:00:26.725 --> 00:00:30.059
So it's actually a pretty
interesting technique.

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.181
So how do we write this in this form?

00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:36.003
Well one way to think about
is if we expanded this

00:00:36.003 --> 00:00:39.436
X plus A squared, we know if
we square X plus A it would be

00:00:39.436 --> 00:00:42.779
X squared plus two A

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:45.775
X plus A squared,

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:49.722
and then you still have that
plus B, right over there.

00:00:49.722 --> 00:00:51.390
So one way to think about it is,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.724
let's take this expression,

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:56.160
this X squared plus 16 X plus nine,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.181
and I'm just gonna write
it with a few spaces in it.

00:00:58.181 --> 00:01:01.866
X squared plus 16 X

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:05.581
and then plus nine, just like that.

00:01:05.581 --> 00:01:08.460
And so, if we say alright,
we have an X squared here.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.340
We have an X squared here.

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.740
If we say that two A X is
the same thing as that,

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.088
then what's A going to be?

00:01:16.088 --> 00:01:19.917
So this is two A times X.

00:01:19.917 --> 00:01:22.438
Well, that means two A is 16

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.837
or that A is equal to 8.

00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:28.775
And so if I want to have
an A squared over here,

00:01:28.775 --> 00:01:33.466
well if A is eight, I
would add an eight squared

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:35.693
which would be a 64.

00:01:35.693 --> 00:01:38.376
Well I can't just add numbers
willy nilly to an expression

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:40.083
without changing the
value of an expression

00:01:40.083 --> 00:01:42.662
so if don't want to change
the value of the expression,

00:01:42.662 --> 00:01:45.448
I still need to subtract 64.

00:01:45.448 --> 00:01:47.642
So notice, all that I have done now,

00:01:47.642 --> 00:01:50.208
is I just took our original expression

00:01:50.208 --> 00:01:53.447
and I added 64 and I subtracted 64,

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:56.720
so I have not changed the
value of that expression.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.318
But what was valuable about me doing that,

00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:02.067
is now this first part of the expression,

00:02:02.067 --> 00:02:04.329
this part right over here,

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.790
it fits the pattern of a perfect square

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.064
quadratic right over here.

00:02:10.064 --> 00:02:13.188
We have X squared plus
two A X, where A is 8,

00:02:13.188 --> 00:02:15.300
plus A squared, 64.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.949
Once again, how did I get 64?

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:21.407
I took half of the 16 and I
squared it to get to the 64.

00:02:21.407 --> 00:02:24.645
And so the stuff that I just squared off,

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:28.569
this is going to be X plus eight squared.

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:32.180
X plus eight, squared.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.463
Once again I know that because
A is eight, A is eight,

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:38.879
so this is X plus eight squared,

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:41.768
and then all of this business
on the right hand side.

00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:44.787
What is nine minus 64?

00:02:44.787 --> 00:02:47.922
Well 64 minus nine is 55,

00:02:47.922 --> 00:02:50.859
so this is going to be negative 55.

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.644
So minus 55, and we're done.

00:02:53.644 --> 00:02:56.302
We've written this
expression in this form,

00:02:56.302 --> 00:02:57.603
and what's also called

00:02:57.603 --> 00:03:00.535
completing the square.
