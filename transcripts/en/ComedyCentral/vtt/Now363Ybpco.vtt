THIS IS HUGE PROGRESS FOR THIS
BUT AS WITH ALL THINGS PROGRESS

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:06.706 align:start position:0% line:85%
IS INCREMENTAL.

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:09.375 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONE STEP FORWARD, TWO BILL
O'REILLY'S BACK.

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:15.415 size:81% position:41% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE AMERICAN PROPAGANDA
CONTINUES WITHOUT FAR LEFT

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:17.950 align:start position:0% line:91%
ZEALOTS TRYING TO DIVIDE
AMERICANS ALONG COLORED LINES.

&gt;&gt; Larry:  I LOVE KNOWING WHEN
I'M GOING TO START SCREAMING AT

00:00:21.253 --> 00:00:22.588 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE TV.

00:00:22.621 --> 00:00:25.091 align:start position:0% line:91%
[LAUGHTER]
SO I CAN ALERT MY DOWNSTAIRS

00:00:25.124 --> 00:00:26.292 align:start position:0% line:85%
NEIGHBORS, RIGHT.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.528 align:start position:0% line:91%
BASICALLY MY NEIGHBORS KNOW
THERE ARE TWO TIMES WHEN THINGS

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:36.936 line:91%
GET LOUD AT CASA WILMORE, ONE
DURING BILL O'REILLY AND THE

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:40.406 align:start position:0% line:91%
NEXT IS WHEN HALLE BERRY IS IN
TOWN

00:00:40.439 --> 00:00:41.741 size:88% position:44% line:85%
SOMETIMES WE WATCH O'REILLY.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:43.209 line:85%
ALL RIGHT, THIS BE GREAT STUFF.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:45.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:51.717 line:91%
ACCORDING TO THE FBI THERE WAS 1
MILLION 163,000 VIOLENT CRIMES

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.818 align:start position:0% line:85%
IN 2013

00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:58.858 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONLY 3,500 WERE CLASSIFIED AS
RACE-BASED HATE CRIMES.

00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:02.795 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  ONLY 3,500? THE LAST
TIME BILL O'REILLY SAID

00:01:02.828 --> 00:01:13.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
ONLY 3,500 IS WHEN SOMEONE ASKED
HIM

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:18.678 size:88% position:44% line:85%
ABOUT HIS CHOLESTEROL LEVEL.

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:23.382 line:91%
LET'S ASSUME THESE NUMBERS
ARE TRUE. EVEN THOUGH BILL IS

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:24.617 line:91%
NOT A BIG NUMBER GUYS WHO SAID
HE WAS COVERING THE FALKLANDS 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.022 align:start position:0% line:91%
WAR BUT WAS 1,200 MILES AWAY.
OKAY, 3500.

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:35.428 size:88% position:44% line:91%
STILL WORKS OUT TO 9.58 RACE
BASED HATE CRIMES PER DAY.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:41.067 align:start position:0% line:91%
ACCORDING TO MY ANALYSIS THAT'S
ABOUT 9.58 TOO MANY.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.801 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.703 align:start position:0% line:91%
[APPLAUSE]
TOO MANY.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:44.904 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES.

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:48.241 line:91%
I AM WILLING TO CONCEDE THERE'S
.01 THAT PROBABLY DESERVES A

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:51.010 align:start position:0% line:85%
LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:54.547 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROBABLY SHOULDN'T SAY THAT I
DON'T KNOW.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:58.818 line:91%
AT LEAST BILL O'REILLY ALWAYS
HAS GUESTS ON TO TALK DOWN TO.

00:01:58.851 --> 00:02:01.754 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT BROTHERS IS HE GOING TO
HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:03.422 align:start position:0% line:91%
IS IT JUAN WILLIAMS? HE'S ON THE
LEFT. HE'S NOT ANGRY ENOUGH.

00:02:03.455 --> 00:02:07.193 size:88% position:44% line:91%
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAYBE IT WILL
BE THAT BLACK LADY FROM OUT

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:07.827 align:start position:0% line:85%
NUMBERED.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.463 size:88% position:44% line:85%
GOT A BIT OF A 'TUDE, RIGHT.

00:02:10.496 --> 00:02:14.133 size:88% position:44% line:91%
OH NO, IT WILL BE THAT CRAZY
BLACK PREACHER TALKING ABOUT

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:15.368 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVING GUNS IN CHURCH.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.269 align:start position:0% line:85%
REMEMBER HIM.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.637 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHICH BLACK FOX ARE YOU GOING TO
BRING OUT.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.642 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; WITH US HERE IN NEW YORK CITY
MONICA CROWLEY.

00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:27.046 align:start position:0% line:85%
AND KIRSTEN POWERS

&gt;&gt; Larry:  TWO WHITE LADIES?

00:02:28.814 --> 00:02:32.585 line:91%
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE A NUANCED
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS RACIAL.

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.921 align:start position:0% line:91%
OKAY, I GUESS THIS IS THE
CONVERSATION I'VE BEEN WAITING

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:37.056 align:start position:0% line:85%
FOR. 

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.060 size:84% position:42% line:91%
FOX, YOU ALWAYS SURPRISE ME
BUT NEVER DISAPPOINT ME.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:50.736 size:81% position:41% line:91%
ACTUALLY, TO BE FAIR, THE
CONTRIBUTOR KIRSTEN POWERS

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.740
ACTUALLY DID TRY TO BRING SOME
REASON TO THE PROCEEDINGS

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:56.742 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; RACISM IS A SERIOUS ISSUE
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU'RE

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:58.277
UNABLE TO SEE THAT.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.914 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DON'T THINK IT'S AN
EPIDEMIC OF RACISM IT'S NOT

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.550 line:91%
INGRAINED IN THIS SOCIETY AND
EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH HAS

00:03:04.583 --> 00:03:06.185 align:start position:0% line:85%
RACIST ELEMENTS IN IT.

00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.087 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  RACIST ELEMENTS.

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:19.899 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT'S A RACIST ELEMENT,
 --NEGRONIUM?

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:24.403 size:88% position:44% line:91%
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND TONS OF
NEGRONIUM IS SOUTH CAROLINA.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:28.207 line:91%
IF O'REILLY CAN'T FIND A BROTHER
TO HAVE ON HIS SHOW, I'M GOING

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.609 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO INVITE MYSELF.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:31.010 size:81% position:41% line:85%
PLAY THAT LAST CLIP AGAIN.

00:03:31.043 --> 00:03:34.480 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I DO THINK RACISM IS A
SERIOUS ISSUE IN THIS COUNTRY.

00:03:34.513 --> 00:03:36.649 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU ARE SO
UNABLE TO SEE THAT.

00:03:36.682 --> 00:03:39.518 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S AN
EPIDEMIC OF RACISM, I DON'T

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:41.821 align:start position:0% line:91%
THINK IT'S INGRAINED IN THE
SOCIETY.

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:45.324 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: HOLD ON KIRSTEM, I
GOT THIS THIS TIME, OKAY.

00:03:45.357 --> 00:03:46.993 size:88% position:44% line:85%
ACTUALLY BILL, YOU'RE RIGHT.

00:03:47.026 --> 00:03:50.796 size:88% position:44% line:91%
IT'S NOT AN EPIDEMIC BECAUSE
THIS [BLEEP] HAPPENS ALL THE

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:51.764 align:start position:0% line:85%
TIME.

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:56.769 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S NOT A PLAGUE IT'S THE
COMMON [BLEEP] COLD.

00:03:56.802 --> 00:03:58.003 align:start position:0% line:85%
NEXT.

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE WORLD IS BEING TOLD BY
ANTI-AMERICAN HATERS THAT WE ARE

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.010 align:start position:0% line:91%
RANK RACIST SOCIETY AND THAT IS
A LIE.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.545 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT, YOU MONICA.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:10.916 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; ARE INDIVIDUAL RACISTS SADLY
YES.

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:13.486 align:start position:0% line:91%
DOES INSTITUTIONAL RACISM EXIST
ANYMORE.

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:14.420 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO IT DOES NOT.

00:04:14.453 --> 00:04:16.422 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  OKAY, OKAY.

00:04:16.455 --> 00:04:20.660 size:81% position:41% line:91%
FIRST OF ALL WHY IS MONICA
CROWLEY ANSWERING HER OWN

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:21.794 size:75% position:38% line:85%
QUESTIONS, I DON'T KNOW.

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:24.196 size:88% position:44% line:91%
DOES IT CONCERN ME ABOUT THE
STATE OF HER MENTAL HEALTH?

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:26.532 align:start position:0% line:85%
YES IT DOES.

00:04:26.565 --> 00:04:35.841 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I'M SAYING IT'S BAD ENOUGH
YOU HAVE THREE WHITE PEOPLE

00:04:35.874 --> 00:04:37.410 align:start position:0% line:91%
DEBATING ABOUT RACISM. BUT THEN
TO HAVE ONE ANSWERING 

00:04:37.443 --> 00:04:39.979 line:85%
HER OWN SOFTBALL RACE QUESTIONS?

00:04:40.012 --> 00:04:43.616 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SLAVERY THAT'S PART OF THIS
COUNTRY'S HISTORY.

00:04:48.987 --> 00:04:51.357 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry: SLAVERY GETS US SO
WHAT.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.095 line:91%
THAT ARGUES YOUR POINT WHY WE'RE
STILL DEALING WITH THIS RACIAL

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:56.862 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROBLEM IN AMERICA.

00:04:56.896 --> 00:04:59.031 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE
HOLOCAUST.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:06.005 line:91%
WHATEVS. SLAVERY IS WHAT THE
CONFEDERATE FLAG DEBATE'S ABOUT

00:05:06.038 --> 00:05:10.843 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE MISSING -- NO IT'S NOT
THE LUNATIC FRINGE.

00:05:10.876 --> 00:05:15.047 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO
ARE RACIST.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.283 align:start position:0% line:85%
RACIST.

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.451 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Larry:  WHAT KIND OF NOISE IS
THAT.

00:05:18.484 --> 00:05:21.187 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN'T SEE WHAT'S
HAPPENING BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.055 align:start position:0% line:85%
ARE NOT RACIST.

00:05:23.088 --> 00:05:23.456 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE'RE NOT.

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:24.257 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; REALLY.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.258 align:start position:0% line:91%

ARE RACISTS, I'M ASHAMED OF YOU.

00:05:33.265 --> 00:05:36.902 align:start position:0% line:91%
[CROWD CHEERING]

FRIENDS DO YOU HAVE AND YOU GOT
ALL MAD

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:44.643 align:start position:0% line:91%
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY
HERE.

00:05:44.676 --> 00:05:49.181 align:start position:0% line:91%
IN FACT, CAN WE JUST PLAY THAT

&gt;&gt; Larry:  SHE ASK YOU AGAIN
AND YOU SAID THE SAME THING.

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.193 align:start position:0% line:85%
OH, MAN.

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:04.930 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I SAY
TO THE FACT THAT YOU THINK

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:06.265 line:85%
RACISM DOESN'T EXIST IN AMERICA.

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:07.298 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO WHAT?
