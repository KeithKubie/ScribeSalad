00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.048
- When we looked at glycolysis

00:00:02.048 --> 00:00:04.509
and the conversion of Pyruvate

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.392
to Acetyl-CoA and then the
Krebs or the Citric acid Cycle,

00:00:09.392 --> 00:00:12.639
we were sometimes directly producing ATPs

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.213
but we were also doing a lot
of reduction of NAD to NADH,

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:19.725
and we later said that NADH,

00:00:19.725 --> 00:00:22.089
that that can later be oxidized, too,

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.915
and that energy from that oxidation,

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:26.178
that energy that's
released from the electrons

00:00:26.178 --> 00:00:29.383
can be used to actually create ATP,

00:00:29.383 --> 00:00:31.305
and NADH is the main character here,

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.239
but there are other
coenzymes that are involved,

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.741
like coenzyme Q, and you
see that right over here.

00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:37.985
And what I want to talk
about in this video

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:42.606
is the process by which we
actually are able to produce ATP

00:00:42.606 --> 00:00:46.477
from the oxidation of these coenzymes,

00:00:46.477 --> 00:00:49.138
and that process is what we call

00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:51.959
Oxidative Phosphorylation.

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:55.893
Oxidative, Oxidative Phosphorylation.

00:00:55.893 --> 00:00:57.735
Now the main player, when we're talking

00:00:57.735 --> 00:01:01.086
about cellular respiration
and Oxidative Phosphorylation,

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:03.508
is NADH.

00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:08.151
NADH, in the process of being oxidized

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.941
to NAD,

00:01:09.941 --> 00:01:13.242
so it gets oxidized to N...

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:17.636
it gets oxidized to NAD,
which has a positive charge,

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:21.079
I often call it NAD+, but let's
think about what this says.

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.656
If we just look at this
reaction from the point of view

00:01:24.656 --> 00:01:27.287
of NADH being oxidized, remember,

00:01:27.287 --> 00:01:31.587
oxidation is losing electrons,

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:34.503
so NAD+, and then you're gonna have

00:01:34.503 --> 00:01:36.936
plus a hydrogen proton

00:01:36.936 --> 00:01:40.559
plus, you're going to have two electrons,

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:42.996
plus two electrons.

00:01:42.996 --> 00:01:45.059
So this is what's happening when NADH

00:01:45.059 --> 00:01:48.234
is being oxidized into NAD,

00:01:48.234 --> 00:01:50.131
so this is Oxidation right over here.

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:51.568
Let me do this in another color.

00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:56.180
So this is Oxidation, and
this process of Oxidation,

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.466
if these electrons get the
appropriate acceptor molecule,

00:02:00.466 --> 00:02:02.810
it can release a lot of energy,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.102
and the eventual acceptor
of those electrons,

00:02:05.102 --> 00:02:09.003
and I can show the corresponding
reduction reaction,

00:02:09.003 --> 00:02:12.501
is we have two electrons,

00:02:12.501 --> 00:02:17.366
two electrons plus two hydrogen protons,

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:19.553
or really, just two
protons, a hydrogen nucleus

00:02:19.553 --> 00:02:21.535
is just a proton, it
doesn't have a neutron

00:02:21.535 --> 00:02:23.883
for the main isotope of hydrogen.

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.852
So two protons

00:02:25.852 --> 00:02:30.689
plus half of an oxygen molecule yielding,

00:02:31.038 --> 00:02:32.967
you put all of these
two, all of these three,

00:02:32.967 --> 00:02:35.060
all of these things
together, I should say,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.916
and you are going to get a water molecule.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:40.400
So you can think of it as the oxygen

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.120
being the final acceptor of the electrons,

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.424
and oxygen likes to be doing oxid--

00:02:45.424 --> 00:02:46.693
likes to oxidize things,

00:02:46.693 --> 00:02:49.008
that's where the whole
word Oxidation comes from.

00:02:49.008 --> 00:02:50.908
So here, (mumbles)

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:52.789
oxygen likes to be reduced.

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.147
It likes to hog electrons,

00:02:55.147 --> 00:02:58.738
so this is oxygen is being reduced.

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:02.985
Oxygen, Oxygen reduced.

00:03:03.336 --> 00:03:06.404
So if you just directly
transferred these electrons

00:03:06.404 --> 00:03:09.357
from our NADH to the Oxygen,

00:03:09.357 --> 00:03:10.916
it would release a lot of energy

00:03:10.916 --> 00:03:12.142
but it would release so much energy

00:03:12.142 --> 00:03:13.505
that you wouldn't be able
to capture most of it.

00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.766
You wouldn't be able to use
it to actually do useful work,

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:19.971
and so the process of
Oxidative Phosphorylation

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:23.801
is all about doing this
at a series of steps

00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.367
and we do it by
transferring these electrons

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.721
from one electron acceptor
to another electron acceptor,

00:03:29.721 --> 00:03:32.904
and every time we do that,
we release some energy,

00:03:32.904 --> 00:03:35.800
and then that energy can be,
in a more controlled way,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.729
be used to actually do
work, and in this case,

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:42.065
that work is pumping hydrogen protons

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:45.002
across a membrane, and then
that gradient that forms

00:03:45.002 --> 00:03:46.983
can actually be used to generate ATP,

00:03:46.983 --> 00:03:48.659
so let's talk through
it a little bit more.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.221
So we're gonna go, these electrons,

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:51.247
they're gonna be transferred,

00:03:51.247 --> 00:03:52.544
and I won't go into all of the details,

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.319
this is to just give you a
high-level overview of it.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:57.815
They're going to be transferred
to different acceptors

00:03:57.815 --> 00:03:59.735
which then transfer it
to another acceptor,

00:03:59.735 --> 00:04:02.456
so it might go to a Coenzyme,

00:04:02.456 --> 00:04:05.798
Coenzyme Q, and a Cytochrome,

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.999
Cytochrome C, and it keeps
going to different things,

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.974
eventually getting to this
state right over here,

00:04:12.974 --> 00:04:15.381
where those electrons can be accepted

00:04:15.381 --> 00:04:18.590
by the oxygen

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.149
to actually form the
water, and the process,

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:24.496
every step of the way,
energy is being released.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:27.677
Energy is being released,

00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:30.451
and this energy, as we
will see in a second,

00:04:30.451 --> 00:04:34.089
is being used to pump hydrogen protons

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:37.441
across a membrane, and we're
gonna use that gradient

00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:40.174
to actually drive the production of ATP.

00:04:40.174 --> 00:04:42.194
So let's think about
that a little bit more.

00:04:42.194 --> 00:04:44.275
So let's zoom in on,

00:04:44.275 --> 00:04:45.798
on a mitochondria.

00:04:45.798 --> 00:04:47.621
So this is mitochondria.

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:49.733
Let's say that's our mitochondria,

00:04:49.733 --> 00:04:52.334
and let me draw the inner membrane

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:55.770
and then, these folds
in the inner membrane,

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.574
the singular for them is crista.

00:04:57.574 --> 00:05:00.074
If we're talking about plurals, cristae.

00:05:00.074 --> 00:05:03.364
So we have these folds in the inner,

00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:05.760
in the inner membrane right over here.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.815
So just to be clear, what's going on,

00:05:07.815 --> 00:05:10.211
this is the outer membrane,

00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:11.632
outer membrane.

00:05:11.632 --> 00:05:15.483
That is the inner
membrane, inner membrane.

00:05:15.483 --> 00:05:18.483
The space between the outer
and the inner membrane,

00:05:18.483 --> 00:05:19.840
the space right over here,

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.049
that is the intermembrane space.

00:05:23.049 --> 00:05:25.947
Intermembrane,

00:05:27.032 --> 00:05:29.728
membrane space.

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:34.414
And then the space inside
the inner membrane,

00:05:34.414 --> 00:05:37.047
let me make that sure you
can read that space properly,

00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:41.414
this space over here, this is the Matrix.

00:05:41.414 --> 00:05:45.063
This is the Matrix, and
that is the location

00:05:45.063 --> 00:05:48.062
of our Citric acid Cycle
or our Krebs Cycle,

00:05:48.062 --> 00:05:50.962
and I can symbolize that
with this little cycle,

00:05:50.962 --> 00:05:52.952
we have a cycle going on here.

00:05:52.952 --> 00:05:56.195
And so that's where the bulk
of the NADH is being produced.

00:05:56.195 --> 00:05:58.738
Now we also talked about
some other coenzymes.

00:05:58.738 --> 00:06:01.677
In some books or classes,
you might hear about FAD

00:06:01.677 --> 00:06:06.055
being reduced to FADH2,
which can then be oxidized

00:06:06.055 --> 00:06:08.505
as part of Oxidative Phosphorylation.

00:06:08.505 --> 00:06:11.407
Other times, well actually,
that's going to be attached

00:06:11.407 --> 00:06:14.737
to an enzyme, and then that FADH2

00:06:14.737 --> 00:06:19.352
is used to reduce
Coenzyme Q to produce QH2,

00:06:19.352 --> 00:06:22.014
and then that participates
in Oxidative Phosphorylation,

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:24.709
so you could think about
either one of these.

00:06:24.709 --> 00:06:26.531
I'll focus on QH2.

00:06:26.531 --> 00:06:27.972
Well, why should we focus on NADH

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:30.077
because it's all a similar process?

00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:33.431
FADH2 or QH2 enters a little bit later

00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:34.493
down this process,

00:06:34.493 --> 00:06:37.848
so they don't produce as much energy

00:06:37.848 --> 00:06:41.285
but they still can be
used to help produce ATP,

00:06:41.285 --> 00:06:44.621
but anyway, our Citric acid Cycle,

00:06:44.621 --> 00:06:47.713
which we have shown in previous videos,

00:06:47.713 --> 00:06:49.892
that occurring in the matrix,

00:06:49.892 --> 00:06:52.183
and now let me do a little zoom in here,

00:06:52.183 --> 00:06:53.739
let me do a zoom in.

00:06:53.739 --> 00:06:56.662
So if I were to zoom in, let's say,

00:06:56.662 --> 00:06:59.185
let me do this in a color that we can see,

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:03.306
so if I were to zoom in right over there,

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:06.765
let's show this fold
in the inner membrane,

00:07:06.765 --> 00:07:08.639
and it's very, and let's make it clear

00:07:08.639 --> 00:07:10.833
that this is, like all of these membranes,

00:07:10.833 --> 00:07:13.711
these are all phospholipid bilayers,

00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:17.414
so, let me draw,

00:07:17.414 --> 00:07:20.293
let me do the same
color that I did in the,

00:07:20.293 --> 00:07:22.011
the actual diagram.

00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:24.799
So, we have...

00:07:26.912 --> 00:07:30.258
all these, we have a
bilayer of phospholipids

00:07:30.258 --> 00:07:33.879
and I'm clearly not drawing
any of this stuff to scale,

00:07:34.445 --> 00:07:39.215
so, almost done.

00:07:39.215 --> 00:07:42.233
All right, just to make it clear.

00:07:44.757 --> 00:07:46.262
And you have these enzymes

00:07:46.262 --> 00:07:49.443
that go across the phospholipid bilayer,

00:07:49.443 --> 00:07:51.444
and these enzymes are,

00:07:51.444 --> 00:07:54.187
and these protein complexes
are actually what facilitate

00:07:54.187 --> 00:07:56.125
Oxidative Phosphorylation

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:59.475
and this chain of enzymes,

00:07:59.475 --> 00:08:02.637
this chain of proteins, is
what we call the electron,

00:08:02.637 --> 00:08:05.938
or what we call the
electron transport chain.

00:08:05.938 --> 00:08:08.074
So we draw that.

00:08:08.074 --> 00:08:11.376
So maybe this is one protein,

00:08:11.376 --> 00:08:14.811
and I'm just drawing them
as kind of these abstract...

00:08:15.735 --> 00:08:17.755
You could refer to the
electron transport chain as

00:08:17.755 --> 00:08:19.695
these proteins or you could
view it as this process of

00:08:19.695 --> 00:08:21.513
these electrons going from
one acceptor to another,

00:08:21.513 --> 00:08:24.137
eventually making its way
all the way to the oxygen.

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:26.215
So that might be one protein,

00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:29.984
this is another protein right over here.

00:08:29.984 --> 00:08:30.932
I'll just do a couple,

00:08:30.932 --> 00:08:33.489
and this is really about
a high-level overview,

00:08:33.489 --> 00:08:35.193
and what's happening

00:08:36.974 --> 00:08:39.818
is as the, and this is
just gonna be a very

00:08:39.818 --> 00:08:42.135
high-level simplification of it,

00:08:42.135 --> 00:08:45.305
as you have your, let's say initially,

00:08:45.305 --> 00:08:47.929
your NADH comes in,

00:08:47.929 --> 00:08:50.935
so your NADH comes in,

00:08:50.935 --> 00:08:53.521
and it donates the
protons and the electrons

00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:56.319
and then it become NAD+,

00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:58.896
so it just became oxidized,

00:08:58.896 --> 00:09:00.907
those electrons will go to an acceptor

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.946
which then gets transferred
to another acceptor

00:09:02.946 --> 00:09:05.008
then get transferred to another acceptor,

00:09:05.008 --> 00:09:07.332
and it goes through this
electron transport chain

00:09:07.332 --> 00:09:09.022
and as that energy is released,

00:09:09.022 --> 00:09:13.606
that energy is used to pump
hydrogen protons from the Matrix

00:09:13.896 --> 00:09:15.951
so this side right over here,
the left side right over here,

00:09:15.951 --> 00:09:17.663
this is the Matrix.

00:09:17.663 --> 00:09:20.798
This is where our Citric
acid Cycle occurs,

00:09:20.798 --> 00:09:23.730
so we have protons being pumped out,

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:27.179
so we have these protons being pumped out

00:09:27.179 --> 00:09:28.850
as we release energy,

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.589
as we go from one electron acceptor

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:33.819
to another electron acceptor,

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:36.406
and so electrons are going
from higher energy states

00:09:36.406 --> 00:09:39.180
and they're releasing
energy as they go down

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.892
this kind of a, towards more
and more electronegative things

00:09:42.892 --> 00:09:44.605
and they feel more
comfortable with the water

00:09:44.605 --> 00:09:47.484
than they feel, than
they felt with the NADH,

00:09:47.484 --> 00:09:50.780
and by doing so, by these
electrons going down

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:52.232
that gradient, I guess you could say,

00:09:52.232 --> 00:09:54.497
or maybe a better way, from going from a,

00:09:54.497 --> 00:09:56.674
a higher energy state
to a lower energy state,

00:09:56.674 --> 00:09:59.194
we are creating this proton gradient,

00:09:59.194 --> 00:10:01.271
so the concentration of protons

00:10:01.271 --> 00:10:03.477
on the right side of this membrane,

00:10:03.477 --> 00:10:05.020
just to be clear where this is.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:08.138
This space right over here,
this is right over there,

00:10:08.138 --> 00:10:10.240
that's the intermembrane space

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.593
where the hydrogen proton
concentration is building up.

00:10:14.593 --> 00:10:17.810
Now, this is stored
energy because this is a

00:10:18.213 --> 00:10:20.490
electrochemical gradient,
all this positive charge,

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.680
they want to get away from each other,

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.234
they want to go to this less
positive Matrix right over here

00:10:25.234 --> 00:10:27.005
and also, just you have
a higher concentration

00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:29.362
of hydrogens and just natural diffusion.

00:10:29.362 --> 00:10:31.684
They would want to go down
their concentration gradient

00:10:31.684 --> 00:10:32.621
into the Matrix.

00:10:32.621 --> 00:10:34.699
There's less of the protons here.

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:37.741
There's less of the protons in the Matrix

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.189
than there are

00:10:40.189 --> 00:10:43.036
in the intermembrane space,

00:10:43.036 --> 00:10:47.181
and so, that's the opportunity
to now take that energy

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:49.364
and produce ATP with them,

00:10:49.364 --> 00:10:52.189
and the way that this
happens, the way this happens,

00:10:52.189 --> 00:10:54.149
let me extend my membrane a little bit,

00:10:54.149 --> 00:10:56.167
that's a different color,

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:59.011
so let me extend my membrane a little bit,

00:10:59.011 --> 00:11:02.611
is using a protein

00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:05.224
called ATP synthase.

00:11:05.224 --> 00:11:08.913
ATP synthase is actually a
protein complex, I should say.

00:11:08.913 --> 00:11:11.509
So ATP synthase, really an enzyme,

00:11:11.509 --> 00:11:13.883
and ATP synthase goes across...

00:11:13.883 --> 00:11:16.339
It's actually a fascinating,
fascinating molecule.

00:11:16.339 --> 00:11:18.720
I'll show a better
diagram of it in a second,

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.418
but your ATP synthase
goes across the membrane,

00:11:21.418 --> 00:11:23.969
it actually has a fairly
mechanical structure

00:11:23.969 --> 00:11:25.698
where it has a bit of a housing

00:11:25.698 --> 00:11:29.016
and it has an axle in the housing,

00:11:29.016 --> 00:11:31.867
so it looks, maybe, something like this,

00:11:31.867 --> 00:11:32.903
and it actually has something,

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:34.988
you can view this as a, as a thing

00:11:34.988 --> 00:11:36.888
that maybe holds it together,

00:11:36.888 --> 00:11:38.220
so it's going across the membrane,

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:41.017
I'll show a better
diagram of it in a second.

00:11:41.017 --> 00:11:44.313
So then, of course, the
membrane continues on,

00:11:44.313 --> 00:11:47.924
the membrane continues
on, and what happens is

00:11:47.924 --> 00:11:49.794
it allows these hydrogen protons

00:11:49.794 --> 00:11:52.413
to flow down their
electrochemical gradient,

00:11:52.413 --> 00:11:54.706
so these hydrogen protons go down

00:11:54.706 --> 00:11:57.388
and they actually cause the axle to spin,

00:11:57.388 --> 00:11:59.020
and so maybe I'll draw it this way.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:03.141
They actually cause the axle to spin

00:12:03.141 --> 00:12:05.157
as they go

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.141
down their electrochemical gradient,

00:12:07.141 --> 00:12:10.537
and as this axle spins,
this axle is not the smooth,

00:12:10.537 --> 00:12:11.997
it's not like it's made
out of metal or something,

00:12:11.997 --> 00:12:14.254
it's made out of amino
acids, so it's got this,

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:17.246
it's all bumpy and all the rest,

00:12:17.246 --> 00:12:18.918
so it looks something like this,

00:12:18.918 --> 00:12:21.657
and what happens is you have ADPs,

00:12:21.657 --> 00:12:23.452
you have ADPs that get lodged in here,

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:26.865
so let's say that's an ADP,
and then a phosphate group,

00:12:26.865 --> 00:12:28.422
and they have actually
three different sites

00:12:28.422 --> 00:12:29.943
where this can happen,

00:12:29.943 --> 00:12:32.569
so that's an ADP and a phosphate group,

00:12:32.569 --> 00:12:34.305
and there's another site
that I'm not drawing,

00:12:34.305 --> 00:12:36.099
but as this thing rotates,

00:12:36.099 --> 00:12:38.673
it essentially keeps changing
the confirmation protein

00:12:38.673 --> 00:12:41.244
and jams the phosphate group into the ADP

00:12:41.244 --> 00:12:43.289
which takes energy and
locks them into place

00:12:43.289 --> 00:12:44.444
to form the ATP.

00:12:44.444 --> 00:12:45.804
When they form the ATP,

00:12:45.804 --> 00:12:49.579
they no longer attach to the active site

00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:50.879
and they let go.

00:12:50.879 --> 00:12:52.686
So you have this,

00:12:52.686 --> 00:12:54.172
actually, this mechanical motor,

00:12:54.172 --> 00:12:56.384
you can view this almost like
a turbine, a water turbine.

00:12:56.384 --> 00:12:58.226
The water goes through
it and then that energy

00:12:58.226 --> 00:12:59.610
is used to generate electricity.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:01.592
Here, hydrogen protons go down

00:13:01.592 --> 00:13:03.063
their electrochemical gradient,

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:06.645
that rotary motion is then
used to jam phosphate groups

00:13:06.645 --> 00:13:09.356
onto ADPs to form ATPs,

00:13:09.356 --> 00:13:12.455
and so this is the actual
ATP production going on.

00:13:12.455 --> 00:13:15.760
And to get a better appreciation

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:16.579
for what's going on,

00:13:16.579 --> 00:13:17.876
this is going on in your body right now,

00:13:17.876 --> 00:13:18.789
this is going on in my body,

00:13:18.789 --> 00:13:19.899
otherwise I wouldn't be able to talk.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:22.842
This is how I'm generating my energy.

00:13:22.842 --> 00:13:26.233
This is a more accurate depiction

00:13:26.233 --> 00:13:29.355
of ATP synthase right over here,

00:13:29.355 --> 00:13:31.979
and based on this diagram,

00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:33.260
this is our...

00:13:34.852 --> 00:13:36.763
let me make sure I...

00:13:36.763 --> 00:13:39.006
So this right over here,

00:13:41.962 --> 00:13:45.522
I'm having trouble drawing on this,

00:13:45.522 --> 00:13:47.026
let me see if I can...

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.110
So this part right over here,

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.061
this area right over there,

00:13:53.061 --> 00:13:55.371
that's our intermembrane space.

00:13:55.371 --> 00:13:58.187
This right over here is our,

00:13:58.187 --> 00:14:00.646
this over here is our Matrix.

00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:04.692
This membrane, this is
a phospholipid bilayer,

00:14:04.692 --> 00:14:08.799
so if I wanted, I could draw
the bilayer of phospholipids

00:14:09.378 --> 00:14:10.574
right over here,

00:14:10.574 --> 00:14:11.644
and this is our inner membrane

00:14:11.644 --> 00:14:13.439
or we could say this is a
fold in the inner membrane,

00:14:13.439 --> 00:14:15.842
this could be on our crista,

00:14:15.842 --> 00:14:18.338
and so the hydrogen protons, they build up

00:14:19.508 --> 00:14:21.089
in the intermembrane space

00:14:21.089 --> 00:14:23.348
because of the electron transport chain,

00:14:23.348 --> 00:14:24.929
and then they flow down

00:14:26.284 --> 00:14:28.452
their electrochemical gradient,

00:14:28.452 --> 00:14:29.767
turn this rotor,

00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:32.710
and then they cause the
creation of the ATPs over here,

00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:35.419
so you have ADP

00:14:36.863 --> 00:14:38.311
plus a phosphate group

00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:41.592
and then you produce your ATP.

00:14:41.592 --> 00:14:42.894
So this is fascinating,

00:14:42.894 --> 00:14:44.537
this is going on in
the cells of your body,

00:14:44.537 --> 00:14:45.886
this is going on as we speak.

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:48.200
It's not some abstract thing
that is somehow separate

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.437
from your reality.

00:14:49.437 --> 00:14:52.438
This is what is making
your reality possible.

00:14:52.438 --> 00:14:54.429
So hopefully, you get a
nice appreciation for this.

00:14:54.429 --> 00:14:55.870
I mean, we spent a lot of time

00:14:55.870 --> 00:14:57.495
talking about cellular respiration,

00:14:57.495 --> 00:14:59.090
we spent a lot of time talking about,

00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.282
OK, we can produce some ATPs directly

00:15:01.282 --> 00:15:04.770
through glycolysis and
through the Citric acid Cycle,

00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:06.489
but mostly, most of the energy

00:15:06.489 --> 00:15:08.404
is because of the reduction
of these coenzymes

00:15:08.404 --> 00:15:10.930
and especially, NAD to NADH,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.573
and then in Oxidative Phosphorylation

00:15:13.573 --> 00:15:15.163
and the electron transport chain,

00:15:15.163 --> 00:15:19.304
we use the Oxidation of the NADH

00:15:19.304 --> 00:15:22.874
to pump hydrogen protons from the Matrix

00:15:22.874 --> 00:15:24.429
to the intermembrane space,

00:15:24.429 --> 00:15:26.211
and then let them go back through,

00:15:26.211 --> 00:15:29.203
through the ATP synthase
which jams the phosphate

00:15:29.203 --> 00:15:31.941
into the ADP to produce the ATP,

00:15:31.941 --> 00:15:35.153
which is our biological
currency of energy.
