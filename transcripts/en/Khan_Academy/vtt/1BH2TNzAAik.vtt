00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.210
A circle has a
circumference of 20 pi.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:11.060
It has an arc
length of 221/18 pi.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.479
What is the central angle
of the arc in degrees?

00:00:15.479 --> 00:00:16.770
So they're asking for this one.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.686
So this is the arc that
they're talking about,

00:00:18.686 --> 00:00:21.760
that's 221/18 pi long.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.720
And they want to know this
angle that it subtends,

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.012
this central angle
right over here.

00:00:27.012 --> 00:00:28.470
So we just have to
remind ourselves

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.630
that the ratio of
this arc length

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.479
to the entire
circumference-- let

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.320
me write that down-- the
ratio of this arc length,

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.460
which is 221/18 pi, to the
entire circumference, which

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.840
is 20 pi, is going to
be equal to the ratio

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.430
of this central angle,
which we can call theta,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.142
the ratio of theta
to 360 degrees

00:00:54.142 --> 00:00:56.100
if we were to go all the
way around the circle.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.390
This will give us
our theta in degrees.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.920
If we wanted it in radians,
we would think of it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.500
in terms of 2 pi radians
around the circle,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250
but it was 360 degrees
since we're in degrees.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.802
Now we just have to simplify.

00:01:11.802 --> 00:01:13.510
Now the easiest thing
is just to multiply

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.200
both sides times 360 degrees.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.770
So let's do that.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.290
So if we multiply the
left-hand side by 360 degrees,

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:33.190
we get 360 times 221
times pi over-- let's see,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.280
we have 18 times 20 times pi.

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.850
And on the right-hand side,
if we multiply it by 360,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.160
we are just left with theta.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.820
So we really just have
to simplify this now.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.920
Pi divided by pi
is going to be 1.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.580
360 divided by 20,
well, it's going

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.464
to be the same thing as 36/2,
which is the same thing as 18.

00:02:04.464 --> 00:02:07.330
And 18 divided by 18 is 1.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.690
So this all simplified
to 221 degrees.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.007
Theta is 221 degrees.
