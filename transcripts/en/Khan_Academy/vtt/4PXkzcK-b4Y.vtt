00:00:00.135 --> 00:00:01.772
- [Voiceover] In this video, I wanna do some examples

00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:04.615
looking at distributions, in particular, different features

00:00:04.615 --> 00:00:08.489
in distributions like clusters, gaps, and peaks.

00:00:08.489 --> 00:00:10.549
So over here, I wanna do some examples.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.699
Which of the following are accurate descriptions

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:14.550
of the distribution below?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.787
Select all that apply.

00:00:16.787 --> 00:00:20.060
So the first statement is the distribution has an outlier.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.163
So an outlier is a data point that's way off

00:00:23.163 --> 00:00:24.930
of where the other data points are,

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.077
it's way larger or way smaller

00:00:27.077 --> 00:00:28.619
than where all of the other data points

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.109
seem to be clustered and if we look over here,

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.448
we have a lot of data points between zero and six.

00:00:34.448 --> 00:00:35.842
And let's just think about what they're measuring:

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:38.411
this is shelf time for each apple

00:00:38.411 --> 00:00:41.921
at Gorg's Grocier.

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:45.183
So, for example, we see there's one, two, three, four,

00:00:45.183 --> 00:00:49.667
five, six, seven apples that have a shelf life

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:52.877
of zero days, so (laughs), they're about to go bad.

00:00:52.877 --> 00:00:56.709
You see you have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:59.299
eight apples that are gonna be good for another day.

00:00:59.299 --> 00:01:00.987
You have two apples that are gonna be good

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:03.968
for another six days, and you have one apple

00:01:03.968 --> 00:01:06.020
that's gonna be good for 10 days, and this is unusual.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.127
This is an outlier here, it has a way larger shelf life

00:01:10.127 --> 00:01:12.339
than all of the other data, so I would say

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.076
this definitely does have an outlier.

00:01:14.076 --> 00:01:15.445
We just have this one data point

00:01:15.445 --> 00:01:18.147
sitting all the way to the right, way larger,

00:01:18.147 --> 00:01:20.633
way more shelf life than everything else, so it definitely

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.874
has an outlier, and this one would be the outlier.

00:01:23.874 --> 00:01:26.772
The distribution has a cluster from four to six days.

00:01:26.772 --> 00:01:29.767
And we indeed do see a cluster from four to six days.

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:33.392
A cluster, you can imagine, it's a grouping of data

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.780
that's sitting there, or you have a grouping of apples

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.857
that have a shelf life between four and six days,

00:01:37.857 --> 00:01:40.478
and you definitely do see that cluster there.

00:01:40.478 --> 00:01:42.040
And since I already selected two things,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.671
I'm definitely not gonna select none of the above.

00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:45.963
Let me check my answer.

00:01:45.963 --> 00:01:50.413
Let me do a few more of these.

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.805
Which of the following are accurate descriptions

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:54.336
of the distribution below?

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:57.458
And once again we're going to select all that apply.

00:01:57.458 --> 00:02:00.163
So the distribution has an outlier.

00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.103
So let's see this distribution.

00:02:02.103 --> 00:02:04.281
I do have a data point here that is at the high end

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:06.608
and I have another data point here that's at the low end,

00:02:06.608 --> 00:02:08.697
but I don't have any data points that are sitting

00:02:08.697 --> 00:02:12.254
far above or far below the bulk of the data.

00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.258
If I had a data point that was out here, then yeah,

00:02:14.258 --> 00:02:16.417
I would say that was an outlier to the right,

00:02:16.417 --> 00:02:19.355
or a positive outlier, if I had a data point way to the left

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.507
off the screen over here, maybe that would be an outlier,

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:23.459
but I don't really see any obvious outliers.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.450
All of the data, it's pretty clustered together.

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.676
So I would not say that the distribution has an outlier.

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:34.728
The distribution has a peak at 22 degrees.

00:02:34.728 --> 00:02:36.745
Yeah, it does indeed look like we have,

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:38.199
and let's just look at what we're actually measuring:

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:42.619
high temperature each day in Edgeton, Iowa in July.

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:44.996
So it does indeed look like we have the most number

00:02:44.996 --> 00:02:49.060
of days that had a high temperature at 22,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.925
most number of days in July had a high tempurature

00:02:51.925 --> 00:02:55.853
at 22 degrees Celsius, so that is a peak.

00:02:55.853 --> 00:02:57.710
You can see it, if you imagine this as kind of a mountain

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.488
this is a peak right here, this is a high point.

00:02:59.488 --> 00:03:03.856
You have, at least locally, the most number of days

00:03:03.856 --> 00:03:06.748
at 22 degrees Celsius.

00:03:06.748 --> 00:03:08.862
So I would say it definitely has a peak there.

00:03:08.862 --> 00:03:10.746
Since I selected something, I'm not gonna select

00:03:10.746 --> 00:03:12.066
none of the above.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:14.486
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:03:14.486 --> 00:03:16.308
Which of the following are accurate descrptions

00:03:16.308 --> 00:03:17.827
of the distribution below?

00:03:17.827 --> 00:03:20.629
So the first one, the distribution has an outlier.

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:21.244
So...

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:26.004
number of guests by day at Seth's Sandwich Shop.

00:03:26.004 --> 00:03:28.594
So, let's see, the lowest...

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:31.884
They have no days...

00:03:31.884 --> 00:03:36.074
No days where he had between zero and 19 guests,

00:03:36.074 --> 00:03:38.888
no days where he had between 20 and 39 guests,

00:03:38.888 --> 00:03:40.343
looks like there's about nine days

00:03:40.343 --> 00:03:42.417
where he had between 40 and 59 guests,

00:03:42.417 --> 00:03:45.625
looks like 20 days where he had between 60 and 79 guests,

00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.011
all the way where it looks like maybe 8 days

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.441
that he had between 180 and 199 guests.

00:03:51.441 --> 00:03:54.402
But the question of outliers, there doesn't seem to be

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:57.833
any day where he had an unusual number of guests.

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.774
There's not a day that's way out here,

00:03:59.774 --> 00:04:02.061
where he had, like, 500 guests.

00:04:02.061 --> 00:04:05.713
So I would say this distribution does not have an outlier.

00:04:05.713 --> 00:04:09.272
The distribution has a cluster from zero to 39 guests.

00:04:09.272 --> 00:04:13.557
So zero to 39 guests is right over here, zero to 39 guests.

00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:16.958
And there is no days where he had between zero and 39 guests

00:04:16.958 --> 00:04:19.730
neither zero to 19, or 20 to 39.

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.063
So there's definitely not a cluster there.

00:04:21.063 --> 00:04:23.743
I would say that the cluster would be between days

00:04:23.743 --> 00:04:27.851
that had between 40 and 199 guests.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:30.029
Definitely not zero and 39, there was no days

00:04:30.029 --> 00:04:32.469
that were between zero and 39 guests.

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:35.903
So I would say none of the above very confidently.

00:04:35.903 --> 00:04:37.875
Let's do one more of these.

00:04:37.875 --> 00:04:39.550
Which of the following are accurate descriptions

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.053
of the distribution below?

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.224
(laughs) Alright.

00:04:42.224 --> 00:04:45.905
The distribution has a peak from 12 to 13 points.

00:04:45.905 --> 00:04:50.650
Let me see what this is measuring, what this data is about.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.950
Test scores by student in Mrs. Frine's class.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.484
So you had one student who got between a zero and a one

00:04:58.484 --> 00:05:01.049
on a 20-point scale, so got between,

00:05:01.049 --> 00:05:04.926
I guess out of 20 questions, got between zero and one point.

00:05:04.926 --> 00:05:07.278
And then you see that there's no students got

00:05:07.278 --> 00:05:09.932
between two and three, or four and five, or six and seven.

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:12.142
Then we have another student who got between eight and nine,

00:05:12.142 --> 00:05:14.560
looks like three students got between 10 and 11,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.435
and then we keep increasing, this looks like about

00:05:16.435 --> 00:05:20.600
12 students got either a 16 or a 17,

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.748
or something in between maybe,

00:05:21.748 --> 00:05:25.303
if you could get decimal points on that test.

00:05:25.303 --> 00:05:29.316
And then it looks like 10 students got from 18 to 19.

00:05:29.316 --> 00:05:31.877
Alright, so this says the distribution has a peak

00:05:31.877 --> 00:05:35.986
from 12 to 13 points, 12 to 13 points,

00:05:35.986 --> 00:05:37.952
there were five students, but this isn't a peak.

00:05:37.952 --> 00:05:40.591
If you just go to 14 to 15 points, you have more students.

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:41.611
So this is definitely not a peak.

00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:43.833
If you were looking at this as a mountain of some kind,

00:05:43.833 --> 00:05:46.078
you definitely wouldn't describe this point as a peak.

00:05:46.078 --> 00:05:48.165
You would say this distribution has a peak,

00:05:48.165 --> 00:05:49.462
it has the most number of students

00:05:49.462 --> 00:05:51.327
who got between 16 and 17 points,

00:05:51.327 --> 00:05:54.414
so that's the peak right there, not 12 to 13 points.

00:05:54.414 --> 00:05:57.137
So I would not select that first choice.

00:05:57.137 --> 00:05:59.614
The distribution has an outlier.

00:05:59.614 --> 00:06:01.480
Well, yeah, look at this: you have this outlier.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.411
Most of the students scored between eight and 19 points,

00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:07.104
and then you have this one student

00:06:07.104 --> 00:06:09.338
who got between zero and one, it's really an outlier.

00:06:09.338 --> 00:06:11.293
You even see this when you look at it visually,

00:06:11.293 --> 00:06:13.669
it's not even connected to the rest of the distribution.

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.130
It's way to the left.

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:17.464
If something is way to the left or way to the right,

00:06:17.464 --> 00:06:21.655
that's an outlier if it's unusually low or unusually high.

00:06:21.655 --> 00:06:23.733
So I would say this distribution definitely does

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:26.207
have an outlier, and I'm not gonna pick none of the above

00:06:26.207 --> 00:06:27.905
since I found a choice.

00:06:29.135 --> 00:06:30.761
And I think we're all done.
