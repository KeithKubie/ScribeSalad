WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
Do you want to get

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.420
your apps on the big screen?

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.550
Well, we've made it
easier than ever before.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.020
I'm Wayne Piekarski, a
Developer Advocate at Google.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.180
And today, I'm going to tell you
about the new Cast SDK Version

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:14.200
3.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.380
In January 2013, we
launched the Google Cast SDK

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.990
to allow developers to extend
their Android, Chrome or iOS

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.630
apps to the big screen
in people's living rooms.

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.270
Since then, we've learned a
lot from our content partners

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.260
and from third-party developers
about what it takes to create

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.462
great Cast-enabled apps.

00:00:32.462 --> 00:00:35.720
Based on their feedback, we've
developed a new, simplified

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.030
Version 3 API for
the Google Cast SDK.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.450
It simplifies several complex
parts of the previous SDK

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.090
and addresses the
major pain points.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330
This new SDK
significantly reduces

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.250
the amount of code needed
to Cast-enable your app.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.220
It also provides a consistent
API across Android and iOS,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.410
with Chrome following later.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.090
The new Cast SDK
provides UI widgets

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.190
that fully comply with the
Cast UX design checklist.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.640
For example, this includes
an introductory overlay

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.190
to introduce users
to the Cast button,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.820
and a Cast button widget
that automatically manages

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.010
its visibility and
state and provides

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.060
all the necessary
dialogs for users

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.780
to select and
disconnect devices.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.670
On Android, we show a Cast
notification with media

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.770
controls when the user
is casting content,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.030
and lockscreen controls
to control media

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.950
playback without
unlocking your phone.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920
There are also
[? persistent ?] controls

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.500
for controlling
the media playback

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.190
while the user is
browsing within your app,

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.370
and a fullscreen
expanded control

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.560
to show the media playback
status there, as well.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.920
Similarly for the
Cast device UI,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.780
the new Cast SDK now provides
reusable receiver widgets

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.620
that comply with the
Cast Design Checklist.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.450
These widgets can be used in
your own custom receiver app

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.470
so you can add
custom business logic

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.190
and support for
your media's DRM.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.890
The new receiver SDK
will be available soon.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.840
The new Cast SDK has
a singleton context

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.040
object to manage all the
interactions with the API.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.030
And on Android, it
eliminates the need

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.720
to deal with Google API client.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.690
The new SDK now provides
automatic device discovery

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.910
so that you don't have to
manage that in your code.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.730
The Cast dialog supports
audio devices, video devices,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.220
and device groups
with no extra work.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.880
There is centralized Cast
session state management

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.820
that makes it easy to launch
your app on the Cast device

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.250
and start media playback.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.770
There's also an automatic
reconnection service

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.360
that handles network issues
and automatically reconnects

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.860
media sessions if you
return to the living room.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.380
There is a media control
object, and associated listeners

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.510
are provided to manage
all the media playback.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.870
And finally, physical
volume buttons

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.160
are automatically
handled as well.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.430
So the new Cast SDK
enables developers

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.720
to target all Cast
devices, including

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.370
Chromecast, Cast for audio,
Cast TV, and Android TV devices.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.870
This new SDK makes
it faster and easier

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.920
to develop a Cast-enabled app.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.830
And as new Cast
features are added,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.140
your app will get these
features automatically

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.890
when you use Version 3
widgets and code modules.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.940
So that's a quick tour
of the great new features

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.640
in the Google Cast
SDK Version 3.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.120
Make sure you check out
our online resources,

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.900
and also join us on our Google+
community to ask questions

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.250
and share information.

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.810
So that's it for now.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.600
I'm Wayne Piekarski, and
I'll see you next time.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.150
