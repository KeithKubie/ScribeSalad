00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:03.302
- [Voiceover] A volunteer
group is planting trees

00:00:03.302 --> 00:00:05.110
at five different parks.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.382
They planted 90 trees at each park.

00:00:07.382 --> 00:00:11.672
How many trees did the group plant in all?

00:00:11.672 --> 00:00:13.730
Here's what we know,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.722
we know that this group went
to five different parks,

00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:18.117
very kind of them,

00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.784
and planted 90 trees
at each of those parks.

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:24.674
If we want to know the total amount,

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:25.729
we could do a couple things.

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:29.905
We could say they planted
90 trees at park one,

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.338
plus 90 more at park two,

00:00:32.338 --> 00:00:36.033
plus, you see where this is
going, 90 more at park three,

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.369
plus 90 more at park four,

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:41.217
and finally 90 more at park five.

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:44.962
One way to solve this would
be to add all those 90s.

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:48.321
We could do it, it'll take a
while, but we could get there.

00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:52.898
Or, we could say that the
group planted 90 trees,

00:00:52.898 --> 00:00:53.815
five times.

00:00:55.186 --> 00:00:58.801
Five times, they planted 90 trees.

00:00:58.801 --> 00:01:00.301
So, 90 times five.

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:02.706
Let's solve both of these.

00:01:02.706 --> 00:01:05.073
Either are great ways
to get to our solution,

00:01:05.073 --> 00:01:06.482
but maybe solving both of 'em

00:01:06.482 --> 00:01:08.481
will help us see if we
liked one way better

00:01:08.481 --> 00:01:11.361
or if one felt simpler for us.

00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:13.111
So, 90, the number 90

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:17.276
we can think of as nine 10s,

00:01:17.276 --> 00:01:19.116
I'll write that up there,

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:20.588
and that'll help us add

00:01:20.588 --> 00:01:23.967
nine 10s plus nine 10s is 18 10s,

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.293
plus nine more 10s is 27 10s,

00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:30.204
plus nine more 10s is 36 10s,

00:01:30.204 --> 00:01:33.954
and the last nine 10s
gets us 45 10s, or 450.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:37.965
That zero is because
we're talking about 10s,

00:01:37.965 --> 00:01:39.215
45 10s, or 450.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.033
The group planted 450 trees.

00:01:46.524 --> 00:01:49.404
Let's try the multiplication
way and see how that goes.

00:01:49.404 --> 00:01:53.237
Again, 90 10 90, we could
think of as nine 10s

00:01:55.895 --> 00:01:59.334
times five, so if you
have nine 10s five times,

00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:00.667
you have 45 10s,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.786
and 45 10s

00:02:04.786 --> 00:02:05.869
is again 450.

00:02:07.843 --> 00:02:09.394
Get that zero on the end.

00:02:09.394 --> 00:02:11.782
Both ways, we see this
is a very generous group.

00:02:11.782 --> 00:02:13.699
They planted 450 trees.

00:02:16.067 --> 00:02:18.307
Either way, we could add
or we could multiply,

00:02:18.307 --> 00:02:21.220
for me, the multiplication
gets me there faster.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.748
I like the multiplication
way, but either way,

00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:27.915
we can see 90 trees at five
parks is 450 total trees.
