&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: So you might ask
yourself why numbers are important

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.140
in the life of a man of letters,
but I'd like to share with you some

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:19.900
of the numbers that struck me when
I was thinking about Ernest Gaines.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.090
The fifth generation born
on a Louisiana plantation.

Four of his works made into movies.

that applause was for me,

up here for a bit,

but we will definitely
take your questions.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.600
I will try to give
you enough notice,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.900
so it's not a fitness contest.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.550
I was asked to let you know
that if you do ask a question,

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.940
you will be part of our

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.730

We're really glad that you made it.

might not be able to.

You know, you said you were done.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.080
In an interview that I found
with the New York Times in 2010,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.490
you said that you had
nothing original left to say.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.790
Do you remember saying that?

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.090

don't remember saying that?

&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: No.

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.140
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: What
made you decide

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.440
that you did have more to say?

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.220
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well,
I don't know.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:31.180
One day I woke up and I thought
about writings and things, and,

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.210
[inaudible] which was originally
titled "The Man with Children."

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:48.480
And thought about why
as a man with children.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.500
There was about three men on
this plantation where I grew up

00:03:53.500 --> 00:04:00.800
and they all sort of looked
after the children [inaudible]

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:11.530
and that was to keep the children
out of jail, and keep the children

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.640
out of trouble with
the law and sheriff.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.780
And especially keeping children
from ever going to Angola,

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.570
so they knew any other way
to control the children.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.190
What had happened, this
would be part of the --

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:46.800
well, during the war when the
military took the young man

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.970
into service, and most
of the other people

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.540
at the same time you have the
tractors taking over the work

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:04.590
that many had done with, you
know, mill and plow and so many

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.700
of the people were sort
of pushed off the land,

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.410
because they had no work there.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:15.040
And the children was
left with the old people

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:21.480
until people got established
someplace in the town or north

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.270
or east or wherever west.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.280
My people went to the West
Coast and I went to California

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:42.370
at an early age, age 15 I went to
California to study, to educate.

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:52.280
And many of the as I say the
younger children were left

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.130
with the old people, and some

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.160
of the old people could
not control the children,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:04.470
and so they got somebody to
help them, and it was that man

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:12.010
who love children and
had put all of his --

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:21.570
three men I knew who did this on
this plantation I made them all

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.190
into this one man, Brady Sims.

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.670
So he is the man that
whipped children.

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:29.970
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: And
when you say "whipped,"

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.350
you don't mean a stern talking to?

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.650
You don't mean don't do that?

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.950
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: No,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.250
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Don't
do that again.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:37.550
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: No,
I mean a switch.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:38.850
I'm in a switch, and
then at the time you had

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.130
to break your own switch, you
know, go out and break it.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:49.150
And you come back and
give you your punishment.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.270
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: The book starts
with something quite shocking.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.150
Do you want to tell it or
do you want me to tell it?

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:00.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well, I thought --

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.430
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: No,
I'm going to reach up to.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.730
I'll take you up there.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.030
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Oh, you're
going to take me up there?

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.990
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: The book
starts in the courtroom

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.140
where a young man who's
just been sentenced

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.510
for a terrible crime
has just been shot.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.800
A man, an elderly man stands up
in the courtroom, and shoots him.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.610
And then the sheriff for
whatever reason, he says,

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.250
"You know what, I need two hours.

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:27.790
Tell them to come get
me in two hours."

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:32.360
And they let him go for two hours.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:39.120
And the young -- it turns out
that the man had shot his own son.

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:40.420
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Yeah.

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.720

read that [inaudible].

00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:31.360
We all got up to leave.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.890
Two deputies had the
prisoner by the arm.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:41.330
I was sitting in the back of the
courthouse, because I had been

00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:45.840
on another assignment and
I had gotten there late.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.680
I was near the aisle
when I heard someone call

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.760
out loud and clear, Boy.

00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.060
I looked back over
my shoulder and saw

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:03.050
that the two deputies had
stopped with their prisoner

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.770
and were facing old Brady Sims.

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:13.690
Next came the loudest sound
that I had ever heard.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:21.320
I saw the prisoner fall back with
blood splashed from his body,

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:27.410
and both deputies let go of
his arms at the same time.

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:36.840
Brady Sims stood there in
that old faded blue jumper

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:43.410
with the smoke still rising
from the gun in his hand.

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:48.090
Then came the screaming, and the
scrambling to get out of the place.

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.970
I'll get down on the floor.

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:54.910
The members of the jury who
didn't run out of the room got

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.540
down behind their chairs.

00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:01.180
The judge went under his desk.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.770
The two deputies stood frozen

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:09.250
with their hands near the
guns, but not on the guns.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:16.640
Brady raising them, his head as
white as cotton is in September,

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.470
stood as straight and tall
as a picket in a fence.

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:24.340
I watched him.

00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:29.680
I watched them all afraid to run,
afraid to get down on the floor."

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.970
"Tell mates, give me
two hours," Brady said.

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:43.500
"Now you don't think you're walking
out of here, do you," Claude said.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.800
"He was the younger
of the two deputies.

Brady got his head off
the chair next to the one

where he had been sitting.

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:57.040
He adjusted well on
that pile of cotton."

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.390
"I didn't come here for no
foolishness, boy," he said.

"Tell me what I said.

He said to Russell, the order
deputy, go on," Russell said,

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:17.400
"Go on like hell, go
on," Claude said.

00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:21.710
"Then I heard that definite
sound again and the smoke rising

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:26.960
up between the old man
and the two deputies."

00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:41.440
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: You know, this is
obviously a very particular place

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.190
and not quite clear when, but
it's very current in some ways

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:50.140
because it's very much about it,
well, it's about a lot of things.

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.390
It's about there's a whole question

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:58.580
of the way law enforcement treats
young black men, which is very much

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:00.720
on people's minds right now.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:04.270
And increasingly if you saw the
video yesterday of that incident

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.750 position:56%
in Salt Lake City, it's also the way
law enforcement treats everybody.

00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.940
No disrespect to law
enforcement here.

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.430
We appreciate you, but that's
very much on people's minds.

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.920
But it's also about how black
people treat each other.

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.950
Do you want to talk a
little but about that?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.250
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Now
if I could read it.

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.040
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Here I'm
going to ask you the part.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.340
Can you read my part?

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.640
Read my part.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:28.940
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I'll
read your part, yeah.

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:30.240
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Then
read the part I like.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:31.540
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Okay.

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:32.840
Good.

00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:34.140
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: We're sharing.

00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.440
We're not really directing,
we're sharing.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.350
This part is the one I like.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.620
Okay.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:45.500
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: "Jamison went
on one Sunday after church.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.600
Tyree told the people
not to leave yet.

00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.980
He had been getting
complaints that children,

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:56.510
the old people couldn't control.

00:12:56.510 --> 00:13:02.750
The mamas and the poppers had
gone to war or up north for work,

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:06.070
leaving the children
with the old people.

00:13:06.070 --> 00:13:12.500
The children stayed in
trouble, always going to jail.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:14.880
Some going to Angola.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.820
They brought up mobile.

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:24.350
For an example what happened
went they went to Angola,

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:33.170
and they didn't want to see
that happen to their children.

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:38.230
They wanted Tyree to
tell them what to do.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:43.840
Tyree told that if they couldn't
control the children get somebody

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.140
on the place who could, but who?

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:53.650
Then they came up with
Brady, Brady Sims.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:57.100
Brady could stop them.

00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:00.590
None of the Brady's kids
ever got into trouble.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:03.650
Brady was the man to do the job.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:05.550
They went to Brady.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.990
Brady said if that's what
they wanted, he would do it.

00:14:09.990 --> 00:14:13.850
They said that's what they wanted.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.270
And they warned their
children, keep it up.

00:14:17.270 --> 00:14:18.600
Keep it up.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:25.160
Just keep it up, you will meet
with Mr. Brady, Mr. Brady's whip.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:29.960
Jamison looked back
at Lucas [inaudible].

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.080
You still with me, Lucas?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.500
You're mighty quiet back
there in that chair.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.890
I'm with you all the way, man.

00:14:37.890 --> 00:14:42.450
Lucas [inaudible] said,
you're telling it to a T.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.750
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Thank you.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:45.550
Beautiful.

00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:49.330
[ Applause ]

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:51.410
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Did anyone
of you all meet a Brady Sims

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.760
when you were growing up?

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:56.630
Did any of you all meet
a Brady Sims, a whipper?

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.640
Were any of you all hit as kids?

00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.940
[laughs] I'm not the only one here.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:06.850
Am I the only one telling
the truth up in here?

00:15:06.850 --> 00:15:09.200
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: We had
it in school at that time.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.750
You know, your teacher had the
authority to whip the children,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:20.680
and [inaudible] of the
children and do their lesson

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.710
or if they did something
wrong, that's it.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.360
They [inaudible] or made
noise or did something.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.510
The teachers controlled
them at that time.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.740
I'm talking about the
40s, the 50s, you know.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.430
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Did
you ever get the switch?

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:40.730
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Oh, yeah.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:43.040
Fighting, and the teacher
would whip you.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:48.270
And they would make you
open your hand out to them

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:52.700
and they would have you
with the ruler and pop, pop,

00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:54.890
pop both hands like this.

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:56.740
So we went to all of that.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:59.090
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: You have a
deep sympathy it seems to me

00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:02.200
for everybody involved
in the situation.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.200
I mean, you have sympathy for the
kids, but you also have sympathy

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.770
for the ones doing the
whipping, it seems to me.

00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:12.200
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well,
I'm God, my people.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:19.750
No matter what you all are, I have
sympathy for you and God loves all

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.650
of us, whether we're
criminals or saints down here.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:27.320
So I have love for all of my
characters, whatever I create.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:32.060
You know, a mean guy, and
Brady Sims can be awful mean.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.920
You know, of course I have
great sympathy for Brady,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:40.280
just as I have sympathy for
the other adults, everybody.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.460
I sure love my people,
I love my characters.

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:44.980
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: One time
a interviewer said to you,

00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:47.450
"There is a high price
attached to bravery."

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:49.740
And you said, "I like
pride in people.

00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:56.540
I try to show the strength
of black people."

00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:00.270
You are showing the
price of that strength.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:01.790
Does that seem right?

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.010
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: The price
of that strength, in what way?

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:09.440
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: The price of what
sometimes it takes for people to be

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.930
who they are, that there is
a price attached to that.

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.230
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Yeah.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.420
I look at like my characters.

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:24.470
Anyone who when you say "brave,"

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:28.860
they go beyond a certain
point, a line.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:38.260 position:56%
A line is drawn for you by your own
people as well as the law out there.

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.540
And you cross that line
then you get punished.

00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.400
You get punished.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.610
You usually get punished when
you question the old people

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:49.350
about why do I have to do this.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:53.480
And of course you get
punished by the, you know,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.520
the white law out there as well,

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.260
that when you do something
really punished.

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.990 position:56%
And that's why the people to try to
keep the people from doing anything,

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:06.790
to keep the people
from going to Angola.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.090
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Angola
being the prison there.

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:09.390
A lot of you heard of that.

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:15.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: That's the number
one -- Angola during the 40s the 40s

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:20.470
and 50s was the worst
prison in this country,

00:18:20.470 --> 00:18:22.480
state prison in this country.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.740
It's in state prison
in Louisiana, Angola.

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:30.240 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: I don't know if
any of you grew up with this notion,

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:33.740
I'm beating you because I
don't want them to kill you.

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.070
Do any of you grow up with that
hearing, I'm going to beat you

00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:41.100
because I don't want that one
out there, the police, the law,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:44.010
the white society to kill you.

00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:47.620
And I think that's -- do you
think that's still with us?

00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.150
Do you think that attitude
is still here?

00:18:49.150 --> 00:18:50.790
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Oh, I think so.

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.820
You know, to a certain degree.

00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:02.140
I don't think about it
[inaudible] well I don't know.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:07.660
But I think they will do
anything to keep children from,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:11.820
you know, going to prison.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.720
They're simply going to stop them.

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:18.020
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Well,
let's open up.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:19.320
Why don't you start
thinking about what it is

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:20.620
that you might want to talk about.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:22.260
You see there are two microphones.

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:25.040
There's one here, and there is
one here, and then we'll take

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.710
as many questions as we can.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.730
I'll give you a chance -- we'll
talk a little bit more up here

00:19:30.730 --> 00:19:32.450
and give you a chance
to come up to the mics,

00:19:32.450 --> 00:19:36.250
and we'll talk a little
bit more as long as we can.

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.070
And also I want to mention that
there's a book signing after this

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:44.100
from 12:00 to 1:00, I believe
wherever it is they are doing

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.400
book signings.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.610
I think that's on the first floor.

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:51.230
And can I ask you about your --

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:54.410
while folks are getting
ready to ask their questions.

00:19:54.410 --> 00:20:01.470
What is your take on the whole
question of Black Lives Matter.

00:20:01.470 --> 00:20:07.010
And the way that a lot of young
folks these days are engaging

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.500
with not just young people, but
mainly they're kind of at the front

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:12.840
of this engaging with law
enforcement right now.

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.630
Many of them are saying
that they're kind of tired

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.470
of the traditional approaches that
people in our generation have used

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:24.640
to engage on these questions.

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.430
Like, you know, protests
and things like that.

00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.120
So they're saying, you know,
they've had it with that.

00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:31.090 position:56%
They don't feel like we're making
enough progress, and I just wondered

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:32.430
if you have thoughts about that?

00:20:32.430 --> 00:20:38.670
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: No, I don't
understand what they're saying.

00:20:38.670 --> 00:20:41.260
I say Black Lives Matter of course.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.040
What else do they have to
say but black lives matter?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.780
I don't know what those kids, youth
you're talking about is saying.

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.240
I don't know how they're
going to protest.

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:54.700
I don't know what they're talking
about they're talking about.

00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:59.800
Yeah. Do you have a question, sir?

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.100
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Sir.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:06.080
&gt;&gt; Frasier O'Leary: Hi, my name
is Frasier O'Leary, and I teach

00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:08.160
or I just retired from teaching

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.680
at Codozo High School
here in the district.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:19.140
And Mr. Gaines came to my class in
1993 to talk to my students as part

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.000
of the Penn Faulkner
Writers in Schools Program.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.680
I don't know if he remembers.

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.650
I know the students do.

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:28.000
And I don't have a question.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.540 position:56%
I just have a comment that I've been
teaching a lesson before [inaudible]

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:36.460
since 1993 to my students
at Cardozo,

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:41.080
and it's always had an
incredible impact on their lives.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.430
And I just wanted to thank
you so much for honoring us

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:48.640
with your visit back in 1993.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:49.940
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Where is this?

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:52.030
&gt;&gt; Frasier O'Leary: At
Cardozo High School here in DC.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:53.330
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.630
&gt;&gt; Frasier O'Leary:
You came to the class.

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:55.930
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Okay.

00:21:55.930 --> 00:21:59.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Frasier O'Leary: And the students
got the book before it was even

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.740
in the book stands,
the hardback copy.

00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:03.040
I still have mine.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.340
You have to sign it today.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:06.040
[ Laughs ]

00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.340
&gt;&gt; Frasier O'Leary: But I just
wanted to thank you for all

00:22:08.340 --> 00:22:12.000
of our students for making such
an impression on their lives.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.300
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Thank
you very much, sir.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.100
&gt;&gt; Frasier O'Leary:
Thank you so much.

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:21.050
[ Applause ]

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:22.350
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Thank
you for that.

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.930
There's some questions
coming up here.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:25.710
You can come here.

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.100
There's a lady here
who has a question.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.750
&gt;&gt; Actually, it's not a
question, and I just wanted

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.890
to let Mr. Gaines know
that my book club,

00:22:33.890 --> 00:22:36.350
the African American
Discussion Group

00:22:36.350 --> 00:22:40.880
in Rockville Memorial
Library read his book,

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.470
discussed his book
on October 16, 2014.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.920
There were about 15 of us.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.580
Everybody loved the book.

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:59.170
The biggest argument was whether
or not the teacher was the one

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.550
who got the lesson as opposed

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:04.480
to the person he was
supposed to be teaching.

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:10.170
And some of us argued that he did
teach the doomed boy something,

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:16.310
and the rest of the said no, it
was the teacher who got the lesson.

00:23:16.310 --> 00:23:17.610
[laughs]

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:18.910
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well both.

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:20.210
&gt;&gt; Both, okay.

00:23:20.210 --> 00:23:22.240
Thank you.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:28.390
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: The
teacher until he --

00:23:28.390 --> 00:23:38.630
Jefferson realized he was a
human being, was running in.

00:23:38.630 --> 00:23:45.460
He wasn't really teaching
until he reached Jefferson,

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:50.360
and then Jefferson's a prisoner.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:58.850
And then he realized that now I
am, you know, he was surprised

00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:04.150
that he had taught anything,
as he hated teaching.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:10.220
But after visiting Jefferson
in jail over and over and over,

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:17.700
and he saw this person who thought
he was an animal as described

00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:30.600
by the lawyer, changing from that
kind of person to a, you know,

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.220
a real human he realized that
by doing that for Jefferson,

00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:40.910
Jefferson had also helped him.

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:46.950
By helping Jefferson,
Jefferson helped him.

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.320
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Thank you.

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:50.620
And here.

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:51.920
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.920
Mr. Gaines, do you have
a favorite of your books?

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.220
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Do I
have a favorite book?

00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.560
&gt;&gt; Yeah. A favorite
of your own books,

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.860 position:56%
which one would you recommend to us?

00:24:58.860 --> 00:25:00.160
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Oh, I
don't have a favorite book.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:01.610
I have a favorite short story.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:02.910
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:05.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Of mine, and that
is Christ Walked Down Market Street.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:11.400
I don't have a favorite
now both, no.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:15.750
And I guess Christ Walked Down
Market Street is my favorite story.

00:25:15.750 --> 00:25:23.210
And it's the oldest story that
I written about California.

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:34.440
Everything else has been written
about as a Louisiana background,

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:39.840
but one story, Christ Walked

00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.380
Down Market Street is
my favorite short story.

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.350
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:48.680
[ Applause ]

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.620
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I could say
one thing more about that story.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:26:03.130
It is a man who meets Christ
twice, and never recognizes it.

00:26:03.130 --> 00:26:05.360
And then he has done, so each time.

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:09.600
He always recognize and
after they have separated,

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:15.270
but he meets him twice, and
that's what my story is about.

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:20.390
&gt;&gt; Dr. Gaines, in reading
your books one character

00:26:20.390 --> 00:26:28.100
that I see represented strongly
is a teacher in each case.

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:33.200
And I like to hear you talk about
your experience with teachers

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:37.060
that brought them into a
prominent role in your writing.

00:26:37.060 --> 00:26:39.570
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Oh, I
have to say in this book,

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:43.010
the character it's a journalist,
and were very happy about that.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:44.570
[ Laughs ]

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:48.940
&gt;&gt; And I will be reading
that one next.

00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:50.240
[laughs]

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.790
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: What role
does the teachers play in --

00:26:51.790 --> 00:26:53.090
&gt;&gt; Your life.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:54.390
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: -- in my life.

00:26:54.390 --> 00:27:02.000
Well, I guess that's why I'm
here today, because of teachers

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:09.470
in my life whom taught me
writing and taught me everything.

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:22.160
Other than your home I think
the teacher is the next greatest

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.170
influence on a student,
especially young people.

00:27:25.170 --> 00:27:29.160
So that's why there's
always some teaching,

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:36.020
somebody's teaching somebody
in my books, I suppose.

00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.280
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Sir.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:44.920
&gt;&gt; Yes. Dr. Gaines, my mother
was from Pointe Coupee,

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.620
and she moved to [inaudible]
for high school.

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:51.630
Then we lived in the St.
Bernard projects until seven

00:27:51.630 --> 00:27:53.400
and moved to Los Angeles.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.920
Before moving to Los
Angeles my whole world

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:59.330 position:56%
in that area was black and Catholic.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:02.720
I went to Los Angeles
in south-central,

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:07.750
the Catholic school became more
than black and all the religions

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:11.360
in my area be mostly black
was I think Catholic.

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.700
It gave me a whole
new take on the world.

00:28:13.700 --> 00:28:17.730
As two things, one, what's
special about Pointe Coupee?

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:20.470
I've never visited it
in your background,

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:24.310
and what events gave
you a broader prospect

00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:27.360
of the world other
than in that area?

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:30.710
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: You say what
is special about Pointe Coupee?

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:36.280
&gt;&gt; Pointe Coupee, and then what
leaving there gave you a more world

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:40.650
view just about people in general?

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:41.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well I've lived --

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:48.090
my first 15 years of my life
is spent in Pointe Coupee.

00:28:48.090 --> 00:28:51.970
Of five generations of my people
lived there from slavery to,

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:56.890
you know, and I still have people

00:28:56.890 --> 00:29:00.710
in Pointe Coupee Parish,
so it is my home.

00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:08.690
It is my home, and much more than
my home than any other place,

00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:17.580
any other part of the state
or in the part of the country.

00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:24.000
You know, the church, well, after
we moved, after we bought a piece

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.700 position:56%
of property on that plantation, my
wife and I, we moved a little church

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:42.960
from the water to our property,
and so to hang onto our history.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:49.430
I went to the little
church as a child

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:56.750 position:56%
and I was taught there my first six
years, six grade, six, seven, eight,

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:01.140
sixth grade, yes as a child
in that little church.

00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:12.690
That is my entire world the
Parish of Pointe Coupee Parish.

00:30:12.690 --> 00:30:14.440
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.740
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Hi.

00:30:15.740 --> 00:30:21.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Hi. Dr. Gaines, I grew up in
Louisiana, and there's a part of one

00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:26.160
of your books that really changed
my view of things of Louisiana,

00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.840
particular part in
my father's house.

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:29.720
I'm just curious, and I know

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:32.820
that I've heard you've been asked
a couple of political questions.

00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:36.160
It doesn't seem to be your
primary interest, but I'm curious

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:40.780
if you think in Louisiana right
now we look at Mitch Landrieu

00:30:40.780 --> 00:30:44.260 position:56%
and New Orleans taking the monuments
down, and those kind of actions.

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:51.330
Do you think anything's changing
deeply in Louisiana toward a view

00:30:51.330 --> 00:30:55.920
of rethinking the past that you're
thinking of from the point of view

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.480
of really taking an
honest look at that past?

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:09.150
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: You know, I never
did notice those little statues.

00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.840
[laughs] I never seen them.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:17.250
I went by them, but it had
no effect on me at all.

00:31:17.250 --> 00:31:21.650
And I think taking them down now,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.900
not that I'm against
taking them down.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.200
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.500
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: But what's
happening now that's really

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.700
separating people much more
than when they were there.

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:41.450
I never did, you know, I don't
think my younger, my siblings

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:47.720
or my older people thought
much of those statues.

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:52.600
They just didn't think about it.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:58.340
But it's a contemporary
feeling by the young people.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:32:03.680
And Jefferson once said
that every generation,

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:06.280
there's a change every generation.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.580
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:12.020
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I mean 20 years
and they have the right to complain

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:19.650
about this, but personally
I haven't been affected

00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:24.960
by the statute being
they are not there.

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.260
&gt;&gt; Right. Thank you.

00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.130
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: But I know
it's happening in a sense

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:33.300
that not taking them down you can
feel this tension now is growing

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:37.980
between the races there.

00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.820
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: In my area.

00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:43.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.900
&gt;&gt; Dr. Gaines, I know how in the
Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman,

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:53.030
it was published that you have
been asked whether it was fiction

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:56.490
or whether it was real,
and you were saying that,

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.250
you know, people were confused.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:02.240
And you came and said, "No, I did
not interview people for this.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.880
These people were my creations."

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:10.450
I want to report to you an odd
occurrence that I had when teaching

00:33:10.450 --> 00:33:13.500
at a middle school in
Frederick many years ago

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.490
that the social studies
teacher there was one

00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:18.950
of the many confused
people you had heard about,

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:26.650
and she had presented the novel
to her students as a real piece

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:32.260
of primary evidence, and
didn't realize it was fiction.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:36.340
In fact, the students themselves
kind of wondered and looked it up

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:41.770
and caught on that in fact it was
fiction, and when they spoke to her

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.350
about it she was very
irate and denied it.

00:33:44.350 --> 00:33:47.810
I came to know of it, and
she told them, you know,

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:49.300
"How dare you question me."

00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:55.170 position:56%
So some of those students came to me
for confirmation, and I said, "Well,

00:33:55.170 --> 00:33:58.880
yes, it's fiction," and then
they told me what was going on.

00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:01.930
At the end of the day
I just had lunch

00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:04.520
with her very quietly
one time, and said that,

00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.800
you know really it was a work
of fiction, and, you know,

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.770
you should probably think

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:11.400
of something you should
say to your students.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:17.250
But I wonder how do you react to
such a thing going on, fiction

00:34:17.250 --> 00:34:22.010
and reality and how
the two of them --

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:24.520
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well, I when
that book first came out, you know,

00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:30.460
a lot of people thought it was
a real person, and Ruby Dee,

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:34.920
the actress wrote in the I think
"Black World," reviewed the book

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.550
for "Black World," and she
reviewed it as a real person,

00:34:38.550 --> 00:34:40.480
several others did the same.

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:49.990
I think it was CBS, one of the
national radio stations called me

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:56.170
on the phone and wanted to know,
they wanted a picture of Mrs. Jane,

00:34:56.170 --> 00:35:02.140
[laughs] so I had to explain she
was not, she was just a creation,

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:05.760
my creation by my imagination.

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.510
But we've had that
since the beginning.

00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:17.000
I just didn't know I could create
a character that could be so real,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.390
and that people would think
that she was actually based

00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:24.650
on a live person, but she was not.

00:35:24.650 --> 00:35:26.030
I've never known one Miss Jane.

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:28.780
I've never in my life
known one Miss Jane,

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.950 position:56%
but I've known a thousand Miss Jane.

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:34.680
See this is no one but
a thousand of them,

00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:36.930
because every time I see
a little old lady walking

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:40.360
down the street that's Miss Jane.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.570
That's Miss Jane to me.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:43.870
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.280
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Thank you, ma'am.

00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:47.760
&gt;&gt; Hi, Mr. Gaines.

00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:51.040
I was one of your students at the
University of Louisiana Lafayette,

00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.340
and one of your neighbors.

00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.070
I'm Lisa Gornick, and I
just want to thank you.

00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.650 position:56%
I know that you inspired me and a
cohort of graduate students who were

00:35:59.650 --> 00:36:04.120
in Louisiana in the
90s to be passionate

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.030
about teaching and
about our students.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:10.420
And my question to you is
about your wife, Diane's work

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:14.800
and how it's influenced you to look
at the populations that you looked

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.100
at with the prison system?

00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.210
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I'm
sorry I didn't.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.740
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: She's asking
you about your wife, Diane.

00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.040
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Yes.

00:36:23.040 --> 00:36:25.040
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Her work has
influenced you in some way,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:29.480
and she also of course wanted to
thank you as an aspiring teacher.

00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.780
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Oh.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.050
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: And she
was one of your students.

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:34.850 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I heard that part.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.490
[ Laughs ]

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.720
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: And we're going
to have time for one more question,

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.160
after this sir, I think
you have a question.

00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.040
We're going to have time for one
more question after this answer.

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.070
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I don't know
how my wife had influenced me

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:48.720
in any way in writing.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:51.600
She likes my writing.

00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.900
That's enough.

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.410
[ Laughs ]

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.710
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Thank you.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.010
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Sir.

00:36:57.010 --> 00:36:58.310
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:59.610
Good morning, Dr. Gaines.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:05.050
You spoke about the fear of
the youth going to Angola.

00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:09.740
I wanted to know if you could
describe the impact of Angola

00:37:09.740 --> 00:37:13.800
on the community that you
grew up in as a child?

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:19.420
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well I've seen
people who've gone to Angola,

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:27.640
and broken -- I mean,
physically and mentally broken.

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:33.650 position:56%
And I've seen people who have come
back from Angola who were more mean,

00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:46.730
more mean or more worse than
they were before they went in.

00:37:46.730 --> 00:37:50.270
I don't know.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.500
I mean I seen people broken down,

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:59.140
and then made more of
a monster by Angola.

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:02.340
But the old people
were just against,

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:05.690
and those were the
ones that came back.

00:38:05.690 --> 00:38:08.950
Many of them never did come back.

00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:10.900
They were sentenced
there for a longer period

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:14.560
of time and they died there.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:21.620
But I'd say they stayed five
years or they were broken.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:23.540 position:56%
They were broken one way or another,

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:30.830
be more cruel toward their own
people or, you know, to anybody

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:38.970
or really become nothing like but
a, you know, helpless creature.

00:38:38.970 --> 00:38:41.070
You ever seen that?

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:42.680
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Before we
let you go, and we're thankful,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.860
so thankful that you are here.

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.160
We are thankful for your work.

00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.400
I was asked to say that
again there's a book signing

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.710
from 12:00 to 1:00.

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.010
It's where all the
book signings are.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:53.310
I think it's on the first floor.

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:57.340
When you exit if you could use
that door, the one that's closest

00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.440
to the stage where we are
now, it would help the folks

00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:03.170
who are managing this room.

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:07.740
Dr. Gaines, one more
question for you from me.

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.870
A lot of us, a lot of people,

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:13.170
just let me just put it
this way are wondering

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:16.310
about what they should
be doing right now.

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:18.110
You spoke of meanness.

00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:23.190
Many have observed that
we are in a mean moment.

00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:25.520
That a lot of our public
discourse is mean.

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:32.010 position:56%
A lot of our politics is mean, and
I wondered if you have some thoughts

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:36.620
about how you would wish
us to meet this moment.

00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:38.350
I know we all have our work.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.670
Your work is as a writer.

00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:42.640
A lot of us do different work.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.320
Do you have thoughts about
what people should do right now

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.010
in the current moment, when you
lived through mean moments before.

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:58.290
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: You know
those questions have been asked

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:01.140
since the beginning of
time, what should people do.

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.400
And what can people do
but try to, you know,

00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:15.920
get along with other persons, the
person around him or around her.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:18.660
I have no answer to that.

00:40:18.660 --> 00:40:21.510
I can't answer that question.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:25.220
I just, you know,.

00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:26.520
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: You do you.

00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:27.820
You do your thing.

00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:29.120
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: I'm sorry.

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:30.420 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: You do your thing.

00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:31.720 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: You do your thing.

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:36.960
You just try to live the best you
can with the people around you.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:41.430
I cannot tell you how to live.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:46.720 position:56%
I will not try to tell anyone how to
live, because I don't know exactly.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:53.930
I know how I live, but what can
I tell you to live the way I do.

00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:55.230
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Well,
thank you for this book.

00:40:55.230 --> 00:40:56.530
Do you have another one in you?

00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:59.650
You said you got up one morning
and just started writing.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:00.950
You got another one?

00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:03.190
You're going to get up tomorrow
around another one for us?

00:41:03.190 --> 00:41:05.310
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Well I
have intended to write.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:13.150
This is a novella really,
and rather than a full novel.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:19.870
And in the beginning I
wanted to write two novellas

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:26.330
to make it a hardback
book, but this small book.

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:33.330
So that's the next project I
have, and I will go back home

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:36.340
and start back over it again.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:40.680
It's about the same
length as this one.

00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.850
The title is The Daughters
of the Creole Lady.

00:41:45.850 --> 00:41:52.650
And I've been playing with that
a long, long time, that title

00:41:52.650 --> 00:41:56.340
and that subject for a long time.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.400
So that's my next project.

00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:06.760
Let's hope I can get it done this
time, because I really wanted

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:14.030
to [inaudible] at the same type
as this one to make it hardback.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:15.330
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Okay.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:17.190
Well we like this one.

00:42:17.190 --> 00:42:18.490
&gt;&gt; Ernest Gaines: Thank
you very much.

00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:19.790
&gt;&gt; Michel Martin: Ernest Gaines.

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:21.090
[Applause].

00:42:21.090 --> 00:42:28.660
His latest book, The
Tragedy of Brady Sims.

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.090
Thank you both.

00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:32.400
Thank you so much for being here.

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.700
Thank you.
