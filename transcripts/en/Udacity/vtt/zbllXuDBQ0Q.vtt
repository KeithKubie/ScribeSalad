00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.130
So so far we have talked about a journal script of going to a restaurant, or

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.192
an abstract script for going to a restaurant. This is like a class. We can

00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:13.200
instantiate it. So let's do this same script instantiated with these values with

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.080
the greatest variables. So, Salwa is not a customer. Lucas is the waiter.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.880
And so on. And this instantiation is an important aspect of intelligence. Let's

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.040
go back to our intelligent agent. It might be that Salwa is really a robot. Now,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.980
how would a robot know what to do in a restaurant? How do we program a robot

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.400
in such a way that it would know what actions to take in a particular situation?

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.850
Well, suppose that, Salwa the robot, in its memory, had a number of scripts like

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.170
this one? And when it entered a restaurant, it invoked the restaurant script,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.460
which told it exactly what kind of actions to take. We could also see how this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.160
script allows Salwa, the robot, to generate expectations, to guess what will

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.870
happen even before it happens. There is one more thing worth noting here.

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.650
Notice how we are composing scripts of these primitive actions here,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.770
the same primitive actions that occurred in the last lesson.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.230
So, these primitive actions are now providing the fundamental units of

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:15.740
frames that compose together in some causally coherent sequence, make a script.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.030
This brings up another point. Notice how some knowledge structures

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.330
are composed out of other knowledge structures. Earlier, we had frames for

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.540
these primitive actions, gave them social knowledge structures. Now,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.860
we have scripts which are composed out of these framelike knowledge structures.
