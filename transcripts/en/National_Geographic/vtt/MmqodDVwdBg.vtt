00:00:01.167 --> 00:00:02.501
- It's fair to say
that North Korea

00:00:02.501 --> 00:00:04.704
is one of the most isolated,

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:07.439
least understood
places on Earth.

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:11.877
Part of the reason that
it is so misunderstood

00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:13.078
and nothing is know about it,

00:00:13.078 --> 00:00:14.413 align:start size:84% position:16%
is there's been
very few photographs

00:00:14.413 --> 00:00:17.083
that have ever been taken there.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:20.587 line:0%

The Associated Press in 2011

00:00:24.157 --> 00:00:27.226 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
came up with the idea to open
an office in North Korea,

00:00:27.226 --> 00:00:29.696 line:0%
and I begged them to let me
be the Pyongyang photographer

00:00:29.696 --> 00:00:31.464 line:0%
if it worked.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:32.932
And they did.

00:00:32.932 --> 00:00:34.767 align:start size:94% position:6%
I went there, and that
meant that I was the first

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:36.135
western photographer to ever

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.704 align:start size:84% position:16%
have regular access
to the country.

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.238
And between then and now,

00:00:39.238 --> 00:00:42.575
I've made about 40 almost
50 trips to North Korea.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.176 align:start size:88% position:13%
It was a very difficult
place to work,

00:00:44.176 --> 00:00:45.645
unlike any other.

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:47.080 align:start size:81% position:19%
You can't just
move around freely

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.648
and do whatever you want.

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.516
A guide goes with
you everywhere,

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:54.987 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they are sort of half
facilitator, half babysitter.

00:00:54.987 --> 00:00:56.689
They didn't censor what I did,

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:59.225 align:start size:94% position:6%
they didn't put their
hand in front of my lens.

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.227
But they did have a
very different idea

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:05.665 align:start size:94% position:6%
of how I should be
portraying their country.

00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:06.866
In fact they had a
very different idea

00:01:06.866 --> 00:01:09.268 align:start size:84% position:16%
of what photojournalism
is completely.

00:01:09.268 --> 00:01:12.071
The word propagandist is not
a dirty word in North Korea,

00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:14.673
it's what they do at
their news agency.

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:17.843 align:start size:94% position:6%
But I went there, I
think, with an open mind,

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:20.746 align:start size:84% position:16%
and a free mind,
and a point of view.

00:01:20.746 --> 00:01:23.549
This is their version of NASA.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.218
(laughing)

00:01:25.218 --> 00:01:27.019
On the week that
the North Koreans

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.856 align:start size:81% position:19%
were going to test
fire a missile,

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.291 align:start size:84% position:16%
the whole world
was condemning them

00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.393 size:81% position:41%
and saying that it was

00:01:33.393 --> 00:01:36.128 align:start size:88% position:13%
a test of a
nuclear-capable rocket.

00:01:36.128 --> 00:01:37.363
The North Koreans
were saying no,

00:01:37.363 --> 00:01:39.565
this is a rocket we're
gonna put into space

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:42.201
to put a weather satellite.

00:01:42.201 --> 00:01:43.268
So they took us there,

00:01:43.268 --> 00:01:45.738
so that I could photograph it.

00:01:45.738 --> 00:01:47.707 align:start size:88% position:13%
This is the best
example what my job was

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:49.241
while I was in North Korea.

00:01:49.241 --> 00:01:51.211
I was interpreting reality,

00:01:51.211 --> 00:01:53.613
trying to decide what was
real and what was not real.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:55.414 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I did that
through photography.

00:01:55.414 --> 00:01:56.582 align:start size:84% position:16%
Through the content
of photography,

00:01:56.582 --> 00:01:57.984
but also the composition,

00:01:57.984 --> 00:01:59.819
the humor, the whimsy.

00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:05.658 align:start size:97% position:3%
I wasn't the (laughing)
senior most American diplomat

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:07.694
in North Korea.

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:09.329
It was this guy.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:11.030
Here he is smoking
a cigar in the gym,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.367 align:start size:94% position:6%
helping pick the
national basketball team.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:15.535
Dennis Rodman.

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.906 align:start size:88% position:13%
I covered the spectacles
and the propaganda.

00:02:19.906 --> 00:02:22.641 align:start size:97% position:3%
This was a mass
synchronized swimming event

00:02:22.641 --> 00:02:24.277
for the birthday of the leader.

00:02:24.277 --> 00:02:25.778
They were swimming
or dancing to a song

00:02:25.778 --> 00:02:29.515 align:start size:97% position:3%
called We Will Defend Kim
Jong-un With our Very Lives.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.585 align:start size:88% position:13%
And this is the national
football stadium.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:35.220 align:start size:94% position:6%
They hold this thing that
they call mass games.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.256
It's like a wonder of the world.

00:02:37.256 --> 00:02:39.058
100,000 people in the stands,

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:42.495
holding these books
with colored pages,

00:02:42.495 --> 00:02:45.831
and they flip them, and they
create these mass mosaics.

00:02:45.831 --> 00:02:46.965
They look like little pixels,

00:02:46.965 --> 00:02:48.467
but you with a long enough lens,

00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:50.837
you can see that they're
actually human pixels,

00:02:50.837 --> 00:02:54.907
little faces peeking over
the tops of the books.

00:02:54.907 --> 00:02:58.043
Eggs with legs. (laughing)

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.612
Sometimes you just
have to photograph

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:01.314
whatever's right
in front of you.

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.581
(laughing)

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:04.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't really
have to try so hard.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.586 align:start size:94% position:6%
That's kind the way I
worked everywhere I went.

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:09.121
You know if they took me to
a patriotic flag factory,

00:03:09.121 --> 00:03:12.224
or a school for performing arts,

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
I just pretty much photographed
what was in front of me.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.528
I thought it was
revealing to show

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:17.563
how the Koreans wanted
to present themselves

00:03:17.563 --> 00:03:19.632
and their country.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.266 align:start size:88% position:13%
And over time I got
further and further away

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.302
from the spectacles and
away from the capital

00:03:23.302 --> 00:03:25.705
and out into places that
really no other foreigners

00:03:25.705 --> 00:03:27.173
had ever been.

00:03:27.173 --> 00:03:30.143 align:start size:97% position:3%
And certainly very few
photographers had ever seen.

00:03:30.143 --> 00:03:32.978
And maybe it was even
more important to me,

00:03:32.978 --> 00:03:34.981
that I found my way
into people's homes

00:03:34.981 --> 00:03:36.716
and into people's offices.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:38.183
Like this woman,

00:03:38.183 --> 00:03:40.019
who's a secretary at the
Korean Central News Agency,

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.788 align:start size:84% position:16%
with her little
aquarium full of fish.

00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:44.323
And I could look
into people's eyes

00:03:44.323 --> 00:03:47.626
and feel like I actually could
make a connection to Koreans.

00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:50.663
I traveled with then Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright.

00:03:50.663 --> 00:03:53.365
As she met with then
leader Kim Jong-il.

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:57.103
We stood in this Wizard
of Oz looking palace,

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.639
and we were all alone waiting
for him to come in the room.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.874
And she looked at me and said,

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:04.142 align:start size:84% position:16%
"what should I do,
where should I stand?"

00:04:04.142 --> 00:04:05.478
And I said, "I have no idea."

00:04:05.478 --> 00:04:06.511
(laughing)

00:04:06.511 --> 00:04:07.680
We stood on these big flowers,

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then the door
opened and he walked in.

00:04:10.583 --> 00:04:12.518 align:start size:81% position:19%
And it was like
I'd only seen this

00:04:12.518 --> 00:04:15.554 align:start size:81% position:19%
kind of fantasy
in a movie before.

00:04:15.554 --> 00:04:17.290
And it was like he just
stepped out of the screen

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.524
into this room.

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.126 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was the first time
that I understood

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:24.230
how I connected to that country

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:27.332 align:start size:97% position:3%
and how surreal and how I
connected as a photographer.

00:04:27.332 --> 00:04:28.601
But also it was the
first time I realized

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:31.003
how important the work
that I could do there,

00:04:31.003 --> 00:04:34.173 align:start size:97% position:3%
if I could only invest my
time and commit to the place.

00:04:34.173 --> 00:04:35.941
Now it wasn't easy
at the beginning.

00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:37.843
Everyone watches you there.

00:04:37.843 --> 00:04:39.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
And on my first trip
with Madeleine Albright,

00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:40.913
when I came out of the airport,

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.815 align:start size:84% position:16%
they drew the
drapes on the bus.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:45.785
They put black plastic over
the windows of my hotel.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:47.019
I couldn't see out.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.088
I felt like there was
nothing real out there,

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:51.557
it was all just a facade.

00:04:51.557 --> 00:04:53.593
But over the years,
through photography,

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:57.597
I could peek around out to the
other side of those curtains.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:00.633
And I came to understand
that there was real life

00:05:00.633 --> 00:05:02.434
in North Korea.

00:05:02.434 --> 00:05:03.969
And through my pictures,

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:06.605
I tried to take everybody
else on that same journey.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:07.973 align:start size:84% position:16%
There was no better
place than North Korea

00:05:07.973 --> 00:05:10.710
to test the power
of photography.

00:05:11.844 --> 00:05:14.213
Photography carries
meaning and mood

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:17.749
in ways that writing or
any other medium can't.

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:20.653 align:start size:84% position:16%
So when this pale pink
curtain comes down,

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:24.790
just covers the eyes of
the people in Pyongyang,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.826
I can say something that
I couldn't say in words.

00:05:27.826 --> 00:05:31.730
And photography has multiple
meanings and interpretations.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:34.466
This is kinda how
I survived there,

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:35.901
the line that I walked.

00:05:35.901 --> 00:05:38.036
This was a vocational
school for children

00:05:38.036 --> 00:05:39.705
to teach them how to be farmers.

00:05:39.705 --> 00:05:40.940
The Koreans took me there,

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:42.175
and they were very
proud to show me

00:05:42.175 --> 00:05:44.710
this very high-tech
tractor simulator.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.279 align:start size:97% position:3%
Of course for people outside,
they see it differently.

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.248
We see their care and their
love for their children,

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:51.484
but to us this is
a practice tractor

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:55.655
with this sort of DOS-level
computer terminal on top.

00:05:57.489 --> 00:05:59.258 align:start size:84% position:16%
We had a lot of
very tough arguments

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:02.294 align:start size:84% position:16%
about why did you
take that photograph?

00:06:02.294 --> 00:06:05.231
We saw that picture, that
doesn't make us look good.

00:06:05.231 --> 00:06:07.533
But I could always fall
back on photography.

00:06:07.533 --> 00:06:08.800
I could hold it up and say,

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.337
this is what I saw, I was there.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.005
This is what we saw.

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:15.441 align:start size:84% position:16%
I used many different
camera formats,

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:17.543
not just to be arty,

00:06:17.543 --> 00:06:21.280
but because of the cat and
mouse game I had to play

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.681
when I worked.

00:06:22.681 --> 00:06:24.650 align:start position:0%
This is an old-fashioned
camera they don't make anymore,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.086 align:start size:81% position:19%
a Hasselblad XPan,
a film camera.

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:29.354
I wore it around my neck.

00:06:29.354 --> 00:06:31.690
I had a cable release so I
could just talk and smile

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:33.459
and take pictures.

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.463 align:start size:97% position:3%
And I had a little carpenter's
level in the flash mount

00:06:37.463 --> 00:06:40.966
so I could make sure that my
horizons were all straight.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.902 align:start position:0%
And when I picked up my big
fancy National Geographic camera

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:46.005
sometimes people were
a bit intimidated,

00:06:46.005 --> 00:06:49.075 align:start position:0%
and the guides certainly watched
me a little more closely.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:50.543
But when I used this one,

00:06:50.543 --> 00:06:52.678 align:start size:97% position:3%
they would say aw that's just
David's old-tiny camera.

00:06:52.678 --> 00:06:56.015
And I did the same
with my mobile phone.

00:06:56.015 --> 00:06:58.117 align:start size:84% position:16%
I took my mobile phone
into North Korea.

00:06:58.117 --> 00:07:00.920 align:start size:94% position:6%
Everybody by now is a
mobile phone photographer.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.421
We all are, even
the North Koreans

00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.724
take pictures with their
phones, believe it or not.

00:07:05.724 --> 00:07:07.827 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I was able to do
things that I couldn't do

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:09.595
with my big cameras.

00:07:09.595 --> 00:07:10.829
It was normal for them

00:07:10.829 --> 00:07:13.131
to see me with a mobile
phone taking pictures.

00:07:13.131 --> 00:07:15.735
And I would also
stop and photograph

00:07:15.735 --> 00:07:17.136 align:start size:84% position:16%
things that I wouldn't
normally notice

00:07:17.136 --> 00:07:18.971
if I was working as
a photojournalist.

00:07:18.971 --> 00:07:20.473 align:start size:84% position:16%
Things that you rush
past on your way

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:21.674
to telling the news,

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.875 align:start size:84% position:16%
things that are simple
little still lives

00:07:23.875 --> 00:07:25.611
that make up the life around you

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.079
and are pieces of the puzzle

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:29.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
in explaining a country
like North Korea.

00:07:29.781 --> 00:07:30.783 align:start size:84% position:16%
But they didn't
allow mobile phones

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:33.385
into the country until 2013.

00:07:33.385 --> 00:07:35.020 align:start size:84% position:16%
Used to be I would
arrive at the country,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.890
and they would take it away
and lock it up in a box.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:39.325
2013 they suddenly said,

00:07:39.325 --> 00:07:42.862 align:start size:97% position:3%
oh foreigners can bring their
phones into the country.

00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:46.265 align:start size:97% position:3%
Not only that, but they opened
a 3G Network, Koryolink.

00:07:46.265 --> 00:07:47.767 align:start size:97% position:3%
And you could do everything
that we do anywhere

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:50.469
with our phones, right in
the streets of North Korea.

00:07:50.469 --> 00:07:53.472
Suddenly I was sending
pictures to the world,

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.441
tens of thousands of
people following me,

00:07:55.441 --> 00:07:58.311
right from a village
or on the streets.

00:07:58.311 --> 00:08:00.012
And that way, sort
of everything became

00:08:00.012 --> 00:08:03.649 align:start size:97% position:3%
worthy of photography, worthy
of my attention I think,

00:08:03.649 --> 00:08:05.618
a piece in the puzzle.

00:08:05.618 --> 00:08:07.519 align:start size:88% position:13%
I started buying things,
collecting things,

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.754
and photographing them,

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:10.622
and putting them out on
my Instagram account.

00:08:10.622 --> 00:08:12.257
I started an artifacts series,

00:08:12.257 --> 00:08:14.993
North Korean artifact 101, 102.

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:18.230
This was the first one, The
Great Teacher of Journalists,

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:20.900
a book I bought in the bookshop.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.337
North Korean artifact 102,
Mountain Mushroom Moonshine.

00:08:25.337 --> 00:08:27.205
(laughing)

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.374
Hangover Chaser Tea (laughing)

00:08:29.374 --> 00:08:32.511 align:start size:84% position:16%
I think this one
was made for export.

00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.613 align:start size:84% position:16%
Money that was no
longer in circulation,

00:08:34.613 --> 00:08:36.882
a debit card from the bank,

00:08:36.882 --> 00:08:41.053
sheet music for piano, a
cookbook from North Korea.

00:08:41.053 --> 00:08:42.421
Here's a good one.

00:08:42.421 --> 00:08:45.023 align:start size:97% position:3%
The Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile Test Firing

00:08:45.023 --> 00:08:47.660
Commemorative Greeting Card.

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.096
(laughing)

00:08:50.096 --> 00:08:53.332 align:start size:88% position:13%
And these were hedgehog
quill toothpicks.

00:08:53.332 --> 00:08:54.834
I photographed them all,

00:08:54.834 --> 00:08:57.536
and they became this sort of
popular like museum series

00:08:57.536 --> 00:09:00.306
on my Instagram account.

00:09:00.306 --> 00:09:01.340 align:start size:84% position:16%
So everyday I would
go out to some

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.409
new and strange place.

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.744
This was a flower festival
for their national flowers,

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:08.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
the Kimjongilia
and the Kimilsungia.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.182
And I would go back to my hotel,

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:11.516
and I would send
my pictures back

00:09:11.516 --> 00:09:12.951
to the newspapers and magazines,

00:09:12.951 --> 00:09:14.386
and I would post
these on Instagram.

00:09:14.386 --> 00:09:15.320
And I had nothing else to do.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.722
The only thing that I could do

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:19.992 align:start size:94% position:6%
was watch state sponsored
propaganda on TV.

00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:23.462 align:start size:94% position:6%
So I would sit and read
the comments on Instagram.

00:09:23.462 --> 00:09:24.897
And people would
ask me questions.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.932
And I would answer them.

00:09:26.932 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start size:84% position:16%
And they would have
all these stereotypes,

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:29.868
and I would get into arguments,

00:09:29.868 --> 00:09:33.872 align:start position:0%
and it was my form of
entertainment while I was there.

00:09:33.872 --> 00:09:35.374 align:start size:88% position:13%
They call them
followers on Instagram,

00:09:35.374 --> 00:09:37.310 align:start size:97% position:3%
but it felt like that, it
felt like they followed me out

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.577
into the field,

00:09:38.577 --> 00:09:39.879
that they were with
me when I was there.

00:09:39.879 --> 00:09:41.247 align:start size:84% position:16%
They became interested
in North Korea,

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.249
they became invested in
me and what I was doing.

00:09:43.249 --> 00:09:45.584 align:start size:84% position:16%
And it was a very
different experience

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.186
than I'd ever had as
a photojournalist,

00:09:47.186 --> 00:09:48.887 align:start position:0%
instead of just publishing 
at people.

00:09:48.887 --> 00:09:52.224 align:start size:84% position:16%
It was a more
dynamic conversation.

00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.725
And it wasn't just Instagram.

00:09:53.725 --> 00:09:56.829
I was doing all social media
with my phone in North Korea.

00:09:56.829 --> 00:10:01.300
Instagram, I was Tweeting,
I started using Foursquare.

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.304 align:start size:94% position:6%
I rated and did restaurant
reviews in Pyongyang.

00:10:08.807 --> 00:10:10.576 align:start size:84% position:16%
And I opened up
Google Maps one day,

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:12.911
and I saw that it was
practically empty.

00:10:12.911 --> 00:10:16.248
And so through Foursquare I
started plotting red flags,

00:10:16.248 --> 00:10:20.653 align:start size:97% position:3%
naming streets, naming
intersections and buildings.

00:10:20.653 --> 00:10:23.089 align:start size:88% position:13%
Where else in the
world can you feel like

00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:25.457
in the 21st century,

00:10:25.457 --> 00:10:28.160
feel like a National
Geographic explorer

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.128
from the 19th century?

00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:33.565
Besides North Korea,
with a mobile phone.

00:10:33.565 --> 00:10:34.834 align:start size:84% position:16%
All I really wanted
to do when I was there

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:36.935 align:start size:84% position:16%
was just open a
window onto a country

00:10:36.935 --> 00:10:39.638
that people knew nothing about.

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.574
To get past all the geopolitics

00:10:41.574 --> 00:10:45.243 align:start size:94% position:6%
and all the saber
rattling between countries

00:10:45.243 --> 00:10:48.246
and to show that some young
army conscript like that

00:10:48.246 --> 00:10:49.748
was a real person,

00:10:49.748 --> 00:10:51.850 align:start size:97% position:3%
to show that there was
something worth understanding

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:54.186
and worth discovering there.
