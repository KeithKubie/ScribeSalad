00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.210
Hi, my name is Desiree Motamedi.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.217
I cover mobile app
advertising at Google.

00:00:05.217 --> 00:00:07.300
We're going to look at the
various business models

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.520
you can use to make
money on your apps.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.450
A successful business model
maximizes the lifetime value

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.630
of every user while delivering
the best experience.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.840
You'll want to evaluate
all revenue stream options

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.631
and pick a strategy
that includes some sort

00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:21.450
of hybrid monetization model.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.600
At a high level, mobile
has three categories

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.390
of monetization, free,
freemium, and premium.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.310
Free is either
purely ad supported

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.850
or directly connected to
a larger brand, generally

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.650
for promotion of a product or
service, such as Uber or Lyft.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.680
Freemium offers users an
app that's free to download,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.280
but might include in-app
billing, in-app ads,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850
subscriptions, or donations.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.750
Premium apps require a
payment before installing.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.762
These types of apps
include paid apps,

00:00:48.762 --> 00:00:50.470
apps in which
subscriptions are required,

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.890
or even a hybrid
model, such as paid app

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.060
that has an in-app purchase.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.960
Now, let's dive deeper into
these three approaches.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.984
We love anything that's free.

00:00:59.984 --> 00:01:02.400
So it's no surprise that users
are more likely to download

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.069
free apps and games.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:05.964
But you've got to
make money somehow.

00:01:05.964 --> 00:01:08.380
If you have a separate business
that's driven by your app,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.570
like that of eBay
or Netflix, you

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.780
don't need to generate income
directly from your app itself.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.810
But if your app
is your business,

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810
you could give it away
for free and place ads

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:19.930
inside the app to
make your money.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.670
Every time someone sees
the add or, in other cases,

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.972
clicks on it, you get paid.

00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:26.680
Different ad networks
have different ways

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.860
of integrating the ads.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.090
For example, with AdMob,
Google's mobile ad network,

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.100
you'll have control over the
types of ads your app will show

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.430
and where they're
placed in your app.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.150
A purely ad
supported model isn't

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.030
your only option for making
money from free apps.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.120
There's a freemium model.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.300
One very popular freemium
solution is in-app billing.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.050
This allows you to
sell digital goods that

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.760
are durable or consumable.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.960
Durable, once purchased, the
item, like an additional app

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.560
feature, for
example, will always

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.090
be available to the user.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.460
Consumable, these are items
that might be used progressively

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.010
or expire after a period
of time, such as currencies

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.120
or points.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.050
Between the two, by
far the most common

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.340
is consumable for
in-app currency.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.449
Most games allow you to
buy currency that can then

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.930
be spent on in-game items.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.570
Comparatively, few will
sell you the items directly.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.000
It's common to have two
forms of currency in a game,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.320
one that can easily be earned
by advancing in a game,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.140
and another that's
very difficult to earn

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.530
and must be bought
with real money.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.160
In-app purchases
are often impulse

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.390
buys and can be a big
moneymaker, especially

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.940
in gaming.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.860
Using Google Analytics and
AdMob also allows you to segment

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.920
your users.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.610
If a user's providing a revenue
stream through in-app purchase,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.450
you can choose not
to show them ads.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.660
We'll explain this in greater
detail in a later video.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.170
Another freemium
strategy would be

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.630
to offer the app for free
with limited features,

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.130
or with full features
for a limited time.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.940
Then, highlight that there are
in-app purchase items available

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.660
that can unlock the
full, unlimited app.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.430
In addition to games,
the freemium model

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.740
has successfully expanded
into other categories,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.100
such as dating, music,
messaging, and news.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.710
Premium apps.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.280
Charging users to
download your apps

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.350
is a simple, convenient
monetization model.

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.270
You create a merchant
account in the app

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.170
store you're using
for distribution.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:10.970
Then set your price.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.210
While the premium model
can be a great approach,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.970
it may limit your app's
monetization potential.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.060
You may be able to achieve
greater revenue using

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.180
a combination of ad
supported, freemium,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.100
or subscription models.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.270
Increasingly, apps and
games are finding success

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:26.140
with hybrid monetization models.

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.165
In fact, Google found
that game developers who

00:03:28.165 --> 00:03:30.510
are combining ads
with in-app purchases

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.690
are getting more than
double revenue per download

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.590
than the developers only
focusing on in-app purchases.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.460
Some other hybrid options
would be show ads in your app

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.242
and remove them if a
user buys a subscription.

00:03:41.242 --> 00:03:42.950
In addition to selling
your app outright,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.380
you could also choose to
include advertising or use

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.170
in-app billing to sell
additional features or content.

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.624
This model could work
well for any app or game,

00:03:50.624 --> 00:03:53.040
but it's most appropriate for
apps with extensive features

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.730
or those that address
a narrow niche.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.860
An example would be
productivity tools,

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.810
like creating tasks, and paying
a monthly fee for reminders.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.720
You can also dynamically
combine in-app billing with ads.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.880
Since only about 50% of
users make in-app purchases,

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.810
you can use Analytics to
identify the other 85%,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.060
and shift to showing them
ads instead of offering them

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.120
in-app purchases.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.120
You'll need to consider
the function of your app

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.249
and your user base to choose
the right monetization approach.

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.540
For our next session, we're
going to focus specifically

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.560
on monetization with ads.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.520
Thanks for watching.
