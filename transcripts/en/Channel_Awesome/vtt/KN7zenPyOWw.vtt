00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.740
[Raptor] Critic!

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.380
Aaah! What the hell?

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.360
Ugh, sorry. I just had a "night-meme".

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.200
A what?

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.940
A "night-meme", something you swear you're never gonna do again,

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.600
but then it works its way into your subconscious so it keeps popping up.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.940
Don't you mean "nightmare"?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.280
(sigh) No...

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.840
That's yet to come.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.440
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic, I remember it so you don't have to!

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.560
Once upon a time there was an awesome movie called "Jurassic Park."

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.920
Then it gave birth to a shitty sequel called "The Lost World."

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.340
[Dr. Malcolm] I don't think so!

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.220
And then that gave birth to the lost cause, "Jurassic Park 3."

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.240
This is the one that many people consider to be the absolute worst of the series.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.320
But... is it really the worst?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.380
I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a bad movie, it's a complete waste of time.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.340
But, in a strange way it kind of knows it's a waste of time,

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.460
so it doesn't even try to be anything big and massive like its predecessors.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
On the one hand, it's kind of refreshing,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.160
as it's only an hour and a half long instead of two and a half hours,

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.940
and most of the time is focused on the dinosaur chases and not annoying characters.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.840
[Amanda] BEN?

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.780
... well, I said "most."

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.840
But does that mean the movie should be hated more, or less?

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.940
It's kind of like punishing a child for doing nothing wrong,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.340
but the punishment is so ridiculously lenient that it's obvious the child isn't gonna learn his lesson.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.160
What's more tragic, the child wrongfully being punished,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.020
or the parent not giving a crap if the punishment's effective?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.760
Let's finish off this "trilogy" sixty-million years in the sucking.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.960
This is "Jurassic Park 3."

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.620
It begins with a kid paragliding with some tour guides

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.980
along the island from the second film that's apparently restricted.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.840
And in case that wasn't clear for all the kindergartners this movie was made for,

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.580
they write it in big cartoon letters to clarify.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.220
Thank you.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
Why don't you just spell it out a little bit more in case we're too fucking stupid to follow?

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.580
So... yeah, the movie's pretty much emphasizing you'd have to be a goddamn idiot to go here,

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.000
so we see some goddamn idiots who decide to go here.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.460
[Ben] Make sure you get us as close as you can!

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.140
[Driver] Not to close, eh? You don't wanna be eaten!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:06.520
I mean, c'mon, they KNOW they're taking a kid into a restricted area filled with fucking dinosaurs.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.220
What could possibly go- ?

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.760
Yeah, after the dinosaurs eat the boat,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.040
the kid and the other guy obviously there just to get eaten cut loose and get blown onto the island.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.120
This leads us to Dr. Grant, a man who says he has no interest in returning to Jurassic Park

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.640
unless he's paid a shit-ton of money.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.820
He's played by Sam Neill, a man who says he has no interest in returning to Jurassic Park

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.320
unless he's paid a shit-ton of money.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.100
Hey, can't fault good casting.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.080
[Dr. Sattler] My editor thinks he's a paleontologist.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.120
[Dr. Sattler] (muttering) That's good.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.240
[Dr. Sattler] Hey, Mark!

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
We see what absolutely nobody wanted to see:

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.800
Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler completely split up, as she decided to have a family with someone else.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.680
Oh, yeah. You nailed that one, movie.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.740
That's EXACTLY what everybody was hoping was going to happen by the end of the first film.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.100
Just like Tommy Lee Jones splitting up with his wife in "Men In Black 2",

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.020
or the orphanage being shut down in "Blues Brothers 2000",

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.120
or all the supporting characters being killed in "Alien 3"!

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.620
You made one of the most likable elements in the previous film mean completely nothing.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.080
(scoff) Why don't you just write a big sign at the ending of the first movie saying:

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.600
[Jake from "Blues Brothers"] Bullshit!

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.080
[Dr. Sattler] So, you know, Mark's been working with the State Department now?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.740
[Dr. Grant] Yeah, what do you do, Mark?

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:28.500
(imitating Grant) Yes, what do you do aside from pumping out children for my baby-obsessed former girlfriend?

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.560
[Dr. Sattler] So what are you working on now?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:30.660
[Dr. Grant] Raptors mostly.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.560
[Dr. Sattler] My favorite.

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.620
The even stranger thing is, they still have chemistry!

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:39.500
When they talk, I want to see them together, I want to see them figure out dinosaur shit!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.820
[Dr. Grant] We found what looks like a very sophisticated resonating chamber.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.620
[Dr. Sattler] Wait a second. So we were right. I mean, they had the ability to vocalize.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.240
But nope! His girlfriend in this movie is replaced by this guy: Billy,

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.800
played by Castor Troy's brother from "Face Off."

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.480
And this time instead of focusing on swapping faces, he's focusing on swapping raptor voices.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:06.280
As, (scoff) get this: they recreate a raptor's vocal chamber, so they can "flawlessly" recreate a raptor's call.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.640
[Billy] Listen to this.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.940
Yeah. I'm SURE that's how it works.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.980
Hey look! I have the vocal chambers of Keanu Reeves!

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.280
(imitating Keanu Reaves) Whoa!

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.680
(imitating Keanu Reaves) Bogus!

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.800
(imitating Keanu Reaves) Somebody put me in a good movie!

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.120
*Guitar riff*

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.920
But it comes too late, as Dr. Grant has to go from fundraiser to fundraiser

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.560
to try and raise money to continue his digging work.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.200
[Principle] Does anyone have a question?

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.100
[Dr. Grant] Does anyone have a question that does not relate to Jurassic Park?

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.580
Hey, it's like the real Sam Neill at a comic convention.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.520
[Male Student] Isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.780
[Male Student] Once the UN and Costa Rica and everyone decides how to handle that second island?

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.320
[Dr. Grant] What John Hammond did at Jurassic Park...

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.240
[Dr. Grant] was create genetically engineered theme park monsters.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.460
[Female Student] You wouldn't want to get onto Isla Sorna and study them, if you have the chance?

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:04.500
[Dr. Grant] No force, on Earth or heaven, could get me on that island.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.900
That's right, no force on heaven or earth, could possibly get him on that island...

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.620
...Except for the exact same thing that got him there in the first movie.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:17.100
[Paul] I could write all kinds of numbers on this check, Dr. Grant.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:24.720
This expedition is run by Paul Pussy and Amanda Pussy, played by William H. Macy and TÃ©a Leoni,

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.100
who tell Dr. Grant they want to explore Isla Sequel on a plane for their anniversary.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.180
And because this movie is just eager to get itself over with, he blindly agrees.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.240
But he can't help but feel something terrible lies in the future...

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.540
[Raptor] Alan!

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.960
[Billy] Alan!

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:50.180
And that was our first big scare everybody! A pre-historic version of the Muppet show!

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.480
[Raptor] Alan!

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.140
Fucking FAIL.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:59.000
I'm sorry, I don't care at what strategic point you put it or in what area you have it pop out,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.920
there is no way a dinosaur saying -

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.840
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:04.980
- is ever going to be scary.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:06.400
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.960
No, I told you, it's not gonna work.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.040
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.740
No, I told you, it's not happening!

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.280
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.400
That's it, I'm outta here.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:17.380
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.300
Will you piss off?!

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.120
[Tamara] Hey Critic, I've got this pain in my stomach, could you check it out?

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.920
Yeah, sure.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.780
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.380
Dammit!

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.380
Will you get lost?!

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.480
[Raptor] Alan!

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.720
Hello?

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.540
[Doctor on phone] Hello, is this Nostalgia Critic?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.080
Yeah?

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.360
[Doctor on phone] This is the St. Joseph Hospital.

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.740
[Doctor on phone] I regret to inform you that you mother has just passed away.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:45.080
Wh-What?

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.100
[Doctor on phone] Yes. She died last night peacefully in her sleep.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:53.380
God, I... I didn't even know she was sick!

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.480
[Doctor on phone] She wanted to keep it from you.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.560
[Doctor on phone] She knew how busy you were, and didn't want to interrupt your work.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:03.380
I... S-Sweet Jesus.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.760
[Doctor on phone] She fought hard. She put up a good fight. But in the end, there's simply nothing we can do.

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:10.780
[Doctor on phone] I'm sorry, son.

00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:16.160
W... D-Did she leave any final words?

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.720
[Doctor on phone] As a matter of fact, she did.

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:20.100
Well what were they?

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.700
[Doctor on phone] It was one, single, solitary word.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.200
Well, what was it, please!

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.500
[Doctor on phone] Alright. Are you listening?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:29.000
Yeah.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.960
[Doctor on phone] (quieter) Are you listening?

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.520
(quieter) Yeah.

00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.080
[Doctor on phone] (even quieter) Are you listening?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:31.580
(even quieter) Yeah.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.080
[Doctor on phone] (even quieter) Are you listening?

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:32.760
(even quieter) Yeah.

00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.620
[Doctor on phone] Alright. Here is her final word:

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:38.660
[Raptor] Alan!

00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.540
I HATE THIS SCARE!

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.280
[Dr. Grant] My God, I'd forgotten...

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.680
(imitating a plane announcer) And if you look down below you'll see the leftover animation from "The Land Before Time 6."

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:57.120
(imitating a plane announcer) Oh, I mean, uh, don't they look real! Wow!

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.380
[Nash] We have a landing strip up ahead, do you want me to put her down?

00:08:59.380 --> 00:09:01.540
[Dr. Grant] What do you mean "set her down," you can't land here, what are you talking about -

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.220
[Paul] Hold on, hold on -

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:06.780
However, when they look for a place to land, Dr. Grant urges them not to, but gets knocked out.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:11.260
When he wakes up, he finds out that the whole point of this journey wasn't to just go sight-seeing,

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:14.140
but to bring back their son who got lost while paragliding.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.000
They also have little-to-no money, are currently divorced,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.640
and really enjoy annoyingly shouting their son's name.

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:20.520
[Amanda] ERIC!

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.180
[Paul] ERIC!

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:21.900
[Amanda] ERIC!

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.460
[Paul] ERIC!

00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:23.360
[Amanda] ERIC!

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:23.940
[Paul] ERIC!

00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.640
[Amanda] ERIC!

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.220
[Paul] ERIC!

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:25.900
[Amanda] ERIC!

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:26.520
[Paul] ERIC!

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:27.260
[Amanda] ERIC!

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:27.960
[Paul] ERIC!

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:31.920
Do you think this island is the police office from "Home Alone"?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.000
I don't think you can just randomly find someone by shouting across the room!

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.140
[Dr. Grant] Will you tell your wife to stop making that noise, that is a very, very bad idea!

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.140
[Paul] Dr. Grant said that's a bad idea.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.880
[Amanda] WHAT'S A BAD IDEA?

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:46.720
[Paul] What was that?

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:48.740
George of the Jungle. What d'ya think?

00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:54.900
So as our team is clearly wondering why the hell they didn't bring a helicopter,

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.900
seeing how they don't need a runway,

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.020
the plane is knocked over by something obviously hungry for extras.

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:06.360
(imitating Nash) Oh please let this be one of those monster movies where the black guy doesn't get- GOD DAMMIT!

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.020
It's okay, just use the bullhorn to call the police!

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.120
[Dr. Grant] Follow me!

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.180
(imitating the Spinosaurus) Alright, your guys go ahead, I'm gonna keep looking for you in here -

00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:21.360
(imitating the Spinosaurus) Oh, hey, I see what you did there!

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.580
But sure enough, who makes another appearance?

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:28.720
â«I'M A MOTHERFUCKIN' T-REXâ«

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.440
YEAH! FUCK YEAH!

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:36.540
GO IN THERE AND TEACH THAT SQUIGGLY JAWED BITCH!

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.500
â«I'M A MOTHERFUCKIN' T-REXâ«

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.460
YEAH! YEAH!

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.180
YEAH! YEAH!

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.620
â«I'M A MOTHERFUCKIN - OH SHIT!

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:55.680
Huh?

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:06.920
No.

00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:08.300
No no no.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.240
No no no no no no no,

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.180
that didn't just happen.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.620
That didn't just happen.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:16.920
That was the motherfuckin' t-rex, nobody outdoes the motherfuckin' t-rex!

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:21.700
Who's this bitch that thinks she's the motherfuckin' t-rex, she's not the motherfuckin' t-rex!

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.580
In the poster for "Transformers 4: The Splooging of the Dong,"

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:30.920
That's not a dinosaur that looks like Daffy Duck's beak after it got shot, it's the motherfuckin' t-rex!

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.400
It's like killing off Batman and replacing him with Super-Duper-Better Man, no no no,

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.820
there's just some things you do not fuck around with!

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.840
I-It's like taking a kids favorite toy and being like...

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.080
[Father] Hey there, kiddo. You like your Dora the Explorer doll?

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.320
[Kid] Sure do!

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.640
[Father] Well, what would you think if I got you a brand new Barbie doll?

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.360
[Kid] Oh, that's okay, I love Dora.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.600
[Father] No, you love Barbie.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.940
[Kid] Um... I'm pretty sure I love Dora -

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.520
[Father] Oh, look at that, Barbie killed Dora, now you have to love Barbie!

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:02.720
[Kid] Poor Dora!

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.060
[Father] YOU CARE NOTHING FOR HER, YOU INSTEAD LOVE YOUR BARBIE DOLL!

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.260
[Kid] I DON'T WANT TO!

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:07.220
[Father] YOU WILL LOVE HER!!!

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.940
[Kid] NO, DADDY, NO!

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:10.680
[FATHER] AAAAAAAAAA -

00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:12.960
Wow...

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.060
I was in a dark place when I wrote that.

00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:16.660
Well, what do you expect?!

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:21.080
Can you really fucking blame me after seeing the motherfucking t-rex be -

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.260
I -

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:23.080
I -

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.140
I need a break.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.460
Here's a donation site to give money to the greatest dinosaur who ever existed.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.540
(choked-up) That was the motherfuckin' t-rex...

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.220
So after the t-rex is killed by the who-cares-asaurus,

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.560
Dr. Grant lets out his frustration on Mr. and Mrs. Pussy.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:01.000
[Amanda] N-N-No no no, please, please, don't, stop, please.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:04.460
And as is typical with every TÃ©a Leoni performance,

00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:08.320
Willy Wonka feigning interest still comes off as more convincing.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.020
[Amanda] Please, please, don't, stop, please.

00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:12.380
[Willy Wonka from "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"] Stop, don't, come back.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:18.120
The whole movie she's like a robot who's trying to figure out this human thing called "emotion."

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.780
[Amanda] Because we have permission to fly low.

00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:22.200
[Amanda] We're not gonna look for Dr. Grant?

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.720
[Amanda] You drive five miles under the speed limit, Paul.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.840
[Amanda] I shot this the morning they disappeared.

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.400
[Amanda] If he'd been with you he'd be completely safe.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:32.700
[Amanda] We even have to seats reserved on the first commercial flight to the moon.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.420
[Data from "Star Trek"] I find it extremely difficult to predict what you will find acceptable.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.400
[Data from "Star Trek"] Perhaps hunger will compel you to try it again.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:44.660
It also doesn't help that she breathes through her mouth more than Kristen Stewart does.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.900
Look at this scene! She doesn't say a line, convey an emotion, or anything!

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:52.080
It just holds on her fucking leaving her mouth open! It's really kinda baffling!

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.220
[Paul] Something... See from the air...

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:59.780
(imitating TÃ©a Leoni) DUUUUUUUUUUH...

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.760
By a pretty big fucking amount of luck they find the kid's parachute,

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.660
as well as Ben, the guy who was paragliding with him.

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.900
Or... at least what's left of him.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.980
Uuugh.

00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:24.380
Y'Know, I didn't think it was possible to out-Capshaw Kate Capshaw, but lady,

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:27.700
you are seriously cutting off the nuts of my patience.

00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.680
[Paul] Okay, okay, you're free -

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.020
(imitating TÃ©a Leoni) I'm gonna go star in an Adam Sandler movie to make his acting look good!

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.260
[Dr. Grant] Get her back, Mr. Kirby!

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.000
[Paul] Amanda!

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:40.240
But they come across not the safest of environments...

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:43.880
[Dr. Grant] (whispering) Raptor...

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.060
[Indiana Jones from "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"] I hate these guys.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.620
Things don't get any better when they come across a research lab where the worst kind of raptor is waiting:

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.040
the mohawk raptor!

00:14:54.620 --> 00:14:58.420
(imitating a Californian accent) Dude, I just wanna be the drummer from Blink 182!

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:01.280
[Dr. Grant] My god...

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.880
[Dr. Grant] It's calling for help.

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:07.520
(imitating Dr. Grant) I'm intrigued by this thing I said I'd never be intrigued by in the opening.

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.080
So the raptors let out the call of...

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.320
Darth Vader with mucus build-up?

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.620
... as everyone gets to safety except Grant.

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.880
(imitating male raptor) Oh no! Maybe we should have actually eaten him

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:37.720
(imitating male raptor) instead of looking at him for a couple seconds!

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.900
(imitating female raptor) I just wanted another one to say "clever girl!"

00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:40.640
(imitating male raptor) Julie!

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.620
(imitating female raptor) I'm sorry, it was just so cool when he said it,

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:44.660
(imitating female raptor) I just wanted to hear somebody else say it again!

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:45.960
(imitating male raptor) You are SO insecure, Julie!

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.660
(imitating female raptor) SHUT UP!

00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:47.460
(imitating male raptor) YOU SHUT UP!

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.020
Thank God Princess Mononoke comes in to save the day,

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:54.200
which turns out to be Eric von Plot-point.

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.020
[Eric] When InGen cleared out they left a lot of stuff behind.

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.240
[Dr. Grant] Any weapons?

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.280
[Eric] No, and I just used the last of the gas grenades.

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.280
[Dr. Grant] Eric, I have to tell you that I am astonished that you've lasted eight weeks on this island.

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.620
[Eric] Is that all it's been?

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:14.360
Okay, I'm all for strong kid characters contributing more to the story aside from being a helpless waif,

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.640
but EIGHT WEEKS on his fucking own?

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.360
On a goddamn island filled with DINOSAURS?

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.240
[Dr. Grant] This is t-rex pee?

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:23.920
[Dr. Grant] How'd you get it?

00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:24.720
[Eric] You don't wanna know.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.260
Why the hell did we even need to rescue this kid?

00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:33.820
We could just drop a bunch of paper-clips and a balloon and he'd have an army style raft in a millisecond!

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.260
They shouldn't be saving that kid, he should be saving them!

00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.580
[Dr. Grant] Did you read Malcolm's book?

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.300
[Eric] It was kinda preachy.

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:43.560
[Eric] And, and too much chaos, everything's "chaos."

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.400
[Eric] It seemed like the guy was kinda high on himself.

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.680
That and he included all his "ums." Who does that?

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:55.120
But when looking for one another they hear a phone ring and conclude that it must be the other group.

00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:59.260
[Paul] I knew it! My God...

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.420
However, strangely enough, neither of them seem to have the phone.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:03.360
[Paul] I don't have it!

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.640
[Paul] I loaned it to Nash.

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.700
[Paul] He must have had it when he -

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:16.240
(imitating the Spinosaurus) You have a voicemail...

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.760
[Dr. Grant] (whispering) Run!

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:23.500
Boy, strange how they could hear the ring of a tiny phone and yet the giant clomping sounds

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.640
of a monster even bigger than the t-rex, who shook the ground whenever she walked,

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.680
for some reason didn't catch their ears.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:46.540
Yes, obviously, if she could crash through a giant spike-filled gate surely a small steel door would be too much for her.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:49.680
I'm sure she shares in the same pain as the aliens from "Signs".

00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.380
But we do discover why the raptors have been pursuing them as long as they were:

00:17:54.380 --> 00:18:00.400
Billy, a fucking expert on dinosaurs, thought stealing a few eggs wouldn't piss them off at all.

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:05.420
[Billy] I took them on an impulse, I thought they'd be worth a fortune, enough to fund the dig site another ten more years.

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:07.240
[Billy] But I did it with the best intentions.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.200
[Dr. Grant] Some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions.

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:14.980
Just look at every Academy Awards show!

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.600
So he decides there's only one thing to do with the eggs...

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:25.040
[Elrond from "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"] DESTROY IT!

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.060
[Paul] What if they catch us with them?

00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:30.480
[Dr. Grant] What if they catch us without them?

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:34.540
(imitating Paul) I thought we agreed we do not negotiate with raptors!

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:41.080
So Indiana Schmo tries to lead them out safely, but guess what the fuck they come across? More dinosaurs!

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:47.700
Oh, God, Pterri's never been the same since they canceled "Pee-Wee's Playhouse."

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.600
[Ptrerri from "Pee-Wee's Playhouse"] Will you come outside and play with me?

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.560
[Ptrerri from "Pee-Wee's Playhouse"] Will you go outside and play with me now?

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.360
[Eric] No!

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:01.460
Huh... I guess the mother wants the kids to work for their food?

00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:05.500
I know whenever I feed a baby, I put the food at least five feet away from him!

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.820
Lazy bastards should work for their own damn grub!

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:09.600
[Dr. Grant] BILLY!

00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:17.040
Of course, he manages to pack the parachute PERFECTLY, despite it being ripped up by a tree,

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:18.860
and manages to save the kid.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.840
[Pee-Wee from "Pee Wee's Playhouse"] Pterri, I told you not to play Acapulco Cliff Diver in the Playhouse!

00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:34.700
[Pee-Wee from "Pee Wee's Playhouse"] Pterri, what's the matter with you? That's the fish's water!

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.820
[Billy] GET AWAY!

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:39.460
But sadly, it seems like he's not able to save himself.

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.360
[Pollux from "Face-Off"] Bye bro.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.100
Despite the loss of their wingman -

00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:52.940
they still manage to throw in a few seconds of, "oh yeah, dinosaurs are magical 'n shit."

00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:01.260
And I mean, literally, a few seconds. Thirty-seven, to be exact.

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:02.360
[Dante from "Clerks"] THIRTY-SEVEN?!

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.640
Yeah, thirty-seven.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.660
This whole movie is like a "Jurassic Park" Paint-by-Numbers.

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:12.600
There's no flow or segue, it's just hitting the points you know you need to hit.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.660
Hit the buildup,

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:14.740
hit the big dino-moment,

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.240
hit the little dino-moment,

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.020
hit the "ooh, ahh" moment.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.720
Except in that "ooh" and "ahh" moment, not only is it incredibly short,

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.220
but the dinosaurs aren't even that whimsical looking!

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.500
They look creepy as fucking shit!

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.800
They look like Purplesaurus crossed with that new faceless Joker.

00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.160
This isn't charming, it's scary as hell!

00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.460
Well, thankfully, they come across one of the intentionally scary ones, though.

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.380
This ought to get a few thrills at least.

00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:57.060
Okay, I think I've figured out the problem here:

00:20:57.060 --> 00:21:01.800
All the dinosaurs that are supposed to be really threatening are either laughably useless or distractingly cute,

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:06.260
and all the dinosaurs that are supposed to be harmless are terrifyingly frightening or horrendously hideous.

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.580
I think someone in the design department got a few notes backwards!

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.580
Oh, it's time to paint number "Obligatory Rain Scene with Monster in it,"

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:17.100
as Flintstone-asaurus attacks yet again.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:23.640
What is this dinosaur's deal with these guys?

00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:30.400
It's not like there isn't bigger game to chase. Hell, the fucking t-rex probably would've fed her for a month,

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.360
so why does she keep going after them?

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.040
Maybe to dinosaurs, all people look like running middle fingers.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.420
Hey, it makes about as much sense as any other reason.

00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.860
But Grant finally manages to get the cell phone to work.

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:46.260
So, who does he call? The police? The army? The navy?

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.480
Okay...?

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.800
[Dr. Sattler's son] Hello?

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:51.720
[Dr. Grant] Take the phone to Mommy, now!

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:56.840
Unfortunately, the kid gets distracted by the Irony Channel, and they have to fight the dino off themselves.

00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.640
[Dr. Grant] THE RIVER! SITE B!

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.540
[Dr. Sattler] HELLO?!

00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.340
[Dr. Sattler's son] Rawr, rawr rawr!

00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:12.120
Well, to be fair, that was scarier than most of the other dinosaurs in this movie.

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.040
But they manage to swim their way out just in time to paint number âAction Breakup Dialogue."

00:22:17.100 --> 00:22:20.020
Oh, it doesn't matter what it is they talk about,

00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:22.540
It can be anything! Really, fucking anything!

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:27.680
Just to make people think theyâre not watching anything but mindless action when clearly thatâs exactly what theyâre doing.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:30.080
Come on. Just a solid minute of filler!

00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.560
[Paul] Remember when we went fishing a couple summers ago?

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:37.120
[Paul] I was putting the boat in the water and the trailer sank.

00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.900
[Paul] The tow truck tried to pull us out and it got dragged in, too.

00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.700
[Paul] The truck driver wanted to knock my lights out.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.240
[Paul] I miss fishing.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.320
Or... ten fucking seconds will apparently do, too!

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:56.420
Wow, that must have been like a record! Possibly the fastest pointless exchange ever in an action movie.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.100
But like I said, nobody cares about getting invested this time around,

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.900
just show us what toys you want us to buy and weâll be good.

00:23:03.740 --> 00:23:04.700
Ah, here we go.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.480
Okay, these are built up as like, the GREATEST hunters,

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:24.580
Why do they always just look at them instead of attacking them and/or getting their eggs back?

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.540
What, is this some kind of power trip for them?

00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:30.960
(imitating male raptor) Well, well, what've we got 'ere, Squiggy?

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:34.200
(imitating another male raptor) Looks like a couple of dweebos that donât need their lunch money.

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:37.440
(imitating male raptor) It'd be a shame if somethin' were to happens to thems.

00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:38.900
(imitating another male raptor) You said it, Squints.

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:48.660
But, of course, Grant manages to communicate with them via bullshit horn.

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:51.840
The translation might have gotten a little jumbled, though.

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:13.740
They manage, of course, to get away and come acrossâ¦

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:18.960
A scene from Lost?

00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.340
...as it turns out Sattler called the right people to save the day.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.080
(imitating a soldier) Thank God we dropped off that guy in the suit totally alone ahead of time

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:33.900
(imitating a soldier) or else youâd be less likely to commit that visual to memory!

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:36.900
Okay, hold on.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.280
So a scientist whoâs not very rich or famous,

00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:44.240
gets help to go after another scientist whoâs not very rich or famous,

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.740
and gets the fucking Army.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:52.680
But when a little kid, who would obviously make headlines if he showed up dead is in trouble, what do we get?

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:53.820
[Amanda] BEN!

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:58.780
UH, BULLSHIT!

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.420
BULLSHIT.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.420
Even Billy seems to have somehow made it out okay.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:08.240
I donât know, the movie doesnât care to explain it. Why should we care to hear it?

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.780
Until it seems the adventure is not quite over.

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.680
[Pilot] What the hell is that?

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:15.340
[Eric] Dr. Grant. look!

00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.760
[Eric] Where do you think they're going?

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:20.740
[Dr. Grant] I donât know, maybe just looking for new nesting grounds.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:22.760
[Dr. Grant] Itâs a whole new world for them.

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.600
[Paul] Let's go home.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:27.480
Except for the fact that it is over.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.000
Well what the flying fuck was the point of that?

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.380
Oh good, the things that tried to peck our dicks off are looking for a new nesting ground!

00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.180
Whoopity-fucking-do, why is this worth mentioning?

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:40.120
Hell, why are you even trying to make it look like a good thing?!

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.260
Killer dinosaurs can take flight and are flying towards your homes!

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:47.340
Whatâs with the whimsy music, this is horrifying news!

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:52.460
(imitating Fievel from "An American Tail") Henri, is that America?

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:57.820
(imitating Henri from "An American Tail") Yes, my dear Fievel. There is still so much America left to eat!

00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:59.860
(imitating Fievel from "An American Tail") Will we devour them all?

00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:06.400
(imitating Henri from "An American Tail") Yes, Fievel! We will make their insides their outsides! Hon hon hon hon!

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:10.960
And thatâs "Jurassic Park 3". Is it the worst of the series?

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.500
Kinda, sorta.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:14.260
But it is mercifully short!

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:18.920
At only an hour and a half, the film plays more like a B-movie.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.520
Just bring in who you like, get them into action quickly, and then have them leave just as quickly.

00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:31.020
While "Lost World" was technically a bigger film, it was so long and so heavy-handed with its message and bland characters,

00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.860
that I remember it being more painful to sit through.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:39.840
Here, the movie kind of knows it has no reason to exist, so it just sort of comes and goes.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:46.080
Itâs obvious less effort is put into it, so itâs kind of hard to get truly that angry with it.

00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:52.700
It comes off as less of an insult and more something that obviously is just pointless in its existence.

00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.440
I guess in the long run, itâs a personal preference which one is the worst.

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.500
But, one thing is definitely for sureâ¦

00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.560
[Dr. Malcolm] That is one big pile of shit.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.400
No, that's what I'm going to take on this MOVIE,

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.060
because not only does it deserve it,

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:09.720
but it would also make it at least a little bit more interesting!

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.840
Iâm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you donât have to!

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.260
[Raptor] Alan!
