00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.230
The benefits of bootstrapping are, I
mean there's so many, I could go on for

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.172
hours but I won't.

00:00:05.172 --> 00:00:10.350
Benefits of bootstrapping essentially
come down to manifest destiny.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.970
You are in control of
everything that you are doing.

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.150
Assuming that you're a sole proprietor
if you have partners, well you have some

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.010
control might be limited with with
a little bickering between your team.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.090
But fundamentally you are in
control of your life, or

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.710
you will feel in control of
your life in what you're doing.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.700
It's a very powerful sense
of being when you have that.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.804
Second thing is you get to define
your own rules for the most part.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:37.837
I mean, obviously, you can't stray off
the path and start breaking the laws.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:42.951
But you are free to dictate
the path forward for yourself and

00:00:42.951 --> 00:00:47.867
what that value means for
your company or your business.

00:00:47.867 --> 00:00:50.942
The other advantages are you're not
going to ever become beholden to

00:00:50.942 --> 00:00:53.070
somebody for the actions you're taking.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.380
Now if the value that you are trading is

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.819
parts of your company or parts of your
product that go into perpetuity like

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.760
giving someone a percentage in exchange
for money, that's not bootstrapping.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.030
That's selling your business or
selling your products, and

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.800
you want to steer away from
that if you're bootstrapping.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.540
Bootstrapping is the pure creation
process of taking something or

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.540
creating something that
wasn't there before and

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.740
making it a thing that generates
value for you into the future.
