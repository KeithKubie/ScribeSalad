00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The reason why I change the actions this way is for my next quiz.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Suppose we punish left turns. Why would we do this?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, in real traffic, left turns are harder to do than the right turns.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Often you have to wait for oncoming traffic.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's say in our planning, left turns are more expensive.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In fact, I should mention that parcel delivery services

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
that plan for optimal routes of trucks like FedEx and UPS in the States,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
they actually plan routes that try to avoid left turns during rush hours,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
because it just takes much longer to do left turns.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If they can go right turns, they prefer those.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
In this example here, let's now say that forward motion will cost you 1.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
A left turn costs you 10, and a right turn costs you 1.

00:00:42.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Now, what is the optimal path, and specifically what's the cost of the optimal path?
