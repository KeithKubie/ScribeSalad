Vsauce, Michael here to tell you that episode

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.040
3 of Leanback is ready. This week the
topic is temperature from very high

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.259
to very low.
It's a television show length

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.940
playlist that I host containing videos from
people all over YouTube.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.820
Now, this one's kind of science-y this time, but I think
the videos that make it up are pretty

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.050
awesome no matter what.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.100
Now, because I can't send a playlist out to you the way
I can upload a video,

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.060
you're going to have to click the first,
top most link in this video's description to

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.109
get things rolling.
If you're on a phone,

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.170
playlists might not work and if you can't wait
for a better time to lean back,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.780
I've put links to every video in the playlist
down below.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.899
And if you have a site and you wanna embed this entire experience,

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.840
guess what? The description has the code you need.
So what are you waiting for?

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.930
To get it started and let the videos play
themselves and the Internet do the work,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.670
get some knowledge, click the link...

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.840
And as always,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:53.960
thanks for watching.
