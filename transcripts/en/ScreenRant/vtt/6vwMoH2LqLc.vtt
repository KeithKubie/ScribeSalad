10 Amazing Movie Special Effects That Are
Not CGI

00:00:09.302 --> 00:00:12.330
As technology evolves, CGI has become a prevalent
tool filmmakers use for the visual effects

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.620
they need in their movies.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.050
Just about anything is possible with computers,
meaning that the only limit is the director’s

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.050
imagination.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.151
While digital effects are extremely photorealistic
and an easy, safer method, there are those

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:26.050
who still prefer to do things to old-fashioned
way.

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.780
Practical effects still have a place in Hollywood
and are arguably making a comeback in big

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.780
budget productions.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.510
Here are 10 amazing movie special effects
that are not CGI.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.940
The Dark Knight Rises

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.290
In the opening sequence of this threequel,
Bane and his mercenaries hijack a CIA plane

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.740
and crash it, jumping to another aircraft
for their getaway.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.920
It seems tailor made for CGI, but Christopher
Nolan did it for real.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.990
Stuntmen jumped out of a real C-130 jet in
the beginning, and their exterior shots on

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:56.690
the CIA plane were accomplished by hanging
a piece of fuselage from a helicopter.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.790
A model was used for the part when the plane’s
wings blew off, and an actual aircraft was

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.650
dropped from the sky at the end.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.369
The jaw-dropping scene took only two days
to film, which is even harder to believe now.

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.799
Star Wars: The Force Awakens

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:13.090
J.J. Abrams used motion capture for two new
characters in his Star Wars sequel, but the

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.840
lovable droid BB-8 was the real deal.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.289
Seven props were constructed for the film,
including one that had to be operated by a

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:21.289
puppeteer.

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.979
Having an actual robot on set was beneficial
for actors Daisy Ridley and John Boyega, who

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.009
shared a number of scenes with BB-8 in the
movie’s first act.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.009
Knowing that the droid was a practical effect
was a prime example of movie magic, and wowed

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.360
fans that saw BB-8 attend conventions and
events throughout the year.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.040
It was so successful, Rian Johnson will be
using the props for Episode 8.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Speed

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.570
This action-thriller was made before CGI became
too advanced, so the filmmakers had no choice

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.520
but to pull off one of the film’s most daring
stunts for real.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.829
In one sequence, the bus has to jump over
a 50-foot gap in the incomplete highway so

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.069
it can keep going.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.090
A ramp was built and an actual bus accelerated
to 61 miles per hour.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.240
The vehicle traveled 109 feet through the
air, and the front wheels reached an altitude

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.549
of 20 feet from the ground.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.520
It was a greater leap than anyone anticipated,
and the bus went out of frame due to incorrect

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.520
camera placement.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.880
The gap was added digitally, but that was
the easy part.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.880
Skyfall

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.260
In the cold open of this James Bond film,
007 tracks his prey to a train and they engage

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.450
in a fight on top of it.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.220
The actors – including Daniel Craig – were
attached to the speeding locomotive by extremely

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.920
thin wires while they acted out the physical
scene.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.280
This was the only thing keeping them from
falling off to impending doom.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.489
It was a highly dangerous stunt, but it added
authenticity to the project and delivered

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.250
a hard-hitting sequence that Bond fans won’t
soon forget.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.269
The Craig era has been defined by practical
visual effects, and this is quite possibly

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.320
the finest instance of that.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.610
Jurassic Park

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.150
Steven Spielberg’s seminal tale of dinosaurs
brought back to life was noteworthy for ushering

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.519
in CGI effects and pushing the next wave of
technology forward, but he still found the

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.580
time to blend the two techniques seamlessly.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.099
A good portion of the dinosaur footage was
handled practically, including a full scale

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.099
t-rex animatronic.

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:06.940
For the famous sequence of raptors hunting
the kids in the kitchen, performers were wearing

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.200
rubber suits as opposed to be digitally inserted
in post.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.680
Maybe this is why the film holds up more than
20 years later.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.380
It wasn’t too reliant on CG and maintained
real world elements.

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.579
The Amazing Spider-Man

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.930
Sam Raimi’s trilogy used digital effects
to show Peter Parker swinging through New

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.830
York, so Marc Webb tried something different
for the reboot.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.549
The 2012 film used stuntmen hanging from wires
that were allegedly “no thicker than a bootlace”

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.390
60 feet in the air.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.620
The wire was connected to a winch on a rail,
which would move down to create the full arc

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.620
of the swing.

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.250
It’s kind of incredible that Webb went to
these lengths to bring Spider-Man alive, demonstrating

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.720
extra determination and effort.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.340
Hopefully, the MCU films with the new Spidey
will carry over some of these techniques to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.849
ground the hero in reality.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.430
127 Hours

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.500
When a character needs to lose a limb nowadays,
the easy trick is to cover it in a green screen

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.480
sleeve and remove it later in post.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.750
For the infamous arm cutting sequence of the
biopic 127 Hours, director Danny Boyle relied

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.459
on classic prosthetics.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.769
Three fake arms were created for the scene.

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.069
One was a recreation of star James Franco’s
arm, and the other two contained the muscle

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.560
and bone he needed to chop through.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.040
They were made in a way that Franco shouldn’t
have been able to cut all the way through,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.440
but that’s exactly what he did when the
cameras started to roll and the take ended

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.050
up in the finished film.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.050
Star Trek

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.289
To deactivate Nero’s drill, Kirk, Sulu,
and a poor red shirt need to perform a jump

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.500
from space into Vulcan’s atmosphere.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.650
Initially filming the actors on harnesses
facing downward, J.J. Abrams had to resort

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.169
to a different method when they kept passing
out.

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.949
It wasn’t CGI. Abrams shot the actors standing
on mirrors from an angle so that the reflection

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.960
of the sky from behind the actors created
the illusion of them falling through the air.

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.270
It would have been simple to stick them in
front of a green screen, but this proved to

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.000
be a creative solution to a problem and nobody
knew the difference when watching it for the

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.250
first time.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.250
The Dark Knight

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.710
The centerpiece of The Dark Knight is the
car chase through Gotham City, where the Joker

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.270
attempts to take out an armored vehicle escorting
Harvey Dent.

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.250
Always one for practical effects, Christopher
Nolan crafted it so that it could all be captured

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.250
in-camera.

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.091
This included the money shot of the sequence:
an eighteen-wheeler flipping over in the streets.

00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:16.840
The crew actually used a real truck for filming,
building a steam-piston mechanism to put in

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.280
the trailer to create the needed upward force.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.490
After testing it out, they closed off a section
of Chicago and flipped the truck, delivering

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.550
an iconic cinematic moment.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.550
Inception

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.030
By now, fans are aware that Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s
hotel fight was accomplished by building a

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.669
rotating set, but Christopher Nolan did even
more outrageous things practically.

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.370
When the team first enters the first dream
level in the third act, a train comes shooting

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.910
through the street, knocking over all the
cars in its path.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.009
A life sized train was actually constructed
and then molded to a semi, which would then

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.540
drive through the set creating the needed
effect.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.690
Even though the train is only in the film
for a fleeting moment, it was still important

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:59.020
for the crew to do it for real, and audiences
are all the more appreciative of their efforts.

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.710
Those are just some of the most incredible
instances of practical effects being used

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.099
instead of digital.

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.460
