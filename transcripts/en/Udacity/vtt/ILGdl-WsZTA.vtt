00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.750
Whatever system you choose to build your
game, take advantage of the objects and

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.920
patterns it provides to decouple
the pieces and simplify development.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.240
These might be special abstract data
types that hide private data, or

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.510
a type safe way to pass
messages between game objects.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.540
There might be a built-in mechanism to
create actors or items in the world, or

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.990
maybe even behaviors that can
be attached to these objects.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.210
The system might provide object pooling
to automatically recycle unused items

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.550
and optimize memory usage.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.730
If you're using a game engine or library
that includes features like these,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.470
they can greatly speed development and

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.970
usually end up making your code
more robust in the process.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.370
You don't have to build these
components from scratch, and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.120
you don't have to debug them usually.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.960
Even if you're not using
a game development framework,

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.980
the programming language you choose may
offer features that can help you create

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.830
solid game code.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.140
Type safety, object-oriented features
like classes and interfaces.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.390
Private data access,
threat synchronization mechanisms,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.000
memory management,
standard collection types.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.150
These are all useful features that
can reduce your coding burden.
