00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.879
What we focus on is the simulation of
complex natural phenomenon. We are mainly

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.650
concerned with it from an aesthetic
perspective â€” so essentially what looks

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.970
interesting. We use a lots and lots of
the same tools that they use in physics or

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.980
computer science, but we of course adapt them to
our own special needs. Around the early

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.710
2000s, computer-generated smoke
and fire, they really started showing up

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.580
and looking very nice in films and this
was because an algorithm was developed

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.649
that actually deals with very broad, fluid
swirls. This is actually the icon that

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.840
you would draw for steam rising off of
a mug or even when children draw wind.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.750
So obviously the swirls are what is the
visually important aspect. The problem is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.170
when you want to do something larger
like a house on fire. In that case, the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.430
visual aspect that is missing is that
there are smaller swirls that are

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.149
layered on top of the large swirl and
these are really what sell the idea that

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.829
something much larger is going on. These algorithms, they are capable of doing

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.339
this sort of thing, it's just it takes a
very long time to compute them so

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.979
instead of waiting maybe a few seconds
to see if the mouse click had the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.670
effect you wanted, you might have to wait
a few hours or maybe overnight. We

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.409
published this paper called Wavelet
Turbulence back in 2008 that dealt with smoke

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.729
simulation and at the highest level what
wavelet turbulence did was it made it

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.590
much faster to get the details needed in
order to make something look like a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.150
forest fire. As with all science, we have to
build on research from other universities. So

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.079
there was a very nice algorithm and they
actually showed how to make these little

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.759
swirls very, very quickly. So we looked at
that and said, "maybe there's a way to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.200
actually couple this to the larger scale flow."
This actually was not a new idea and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.079
the problem was if you have these tiny
little swirls everywhere, it does look a

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.259
little bit larger, but

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.549
the ones that are, you know, way out here
it does look wrong. So we had to answer

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.000
the question: where she's tiny swirls
actually appear and where should they

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.399
not appear? And for this we used a tool called a wavelet transform. Once you've injected

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.820
these tiny vortices, they do need to move
along with the flow. So we added another

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.209
detail to pull these along with the flow.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.190
This is a method called texture
advection. There was one last piece

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.750
though

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.140
that was creating some visual problems
for us. Say we have this vortex. The flow

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.380
that's pulling it along, it actually pulls
things apart. There's actually the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.540
opposite process as well. You have a large
flow that's actually pushing them

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.420
together. And we were seeing that this
physics was missing. So what we did was we

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.940
built a Jacobian matrix. This will
actually tell you which situation you

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.110
may be in. We checked if we were in either of
these situations and if it was we

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.530
actually removed that whirl. It seemed to
fix the visual artifacts that we'd seen

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.910
before and with that we considered the
algorithm complete. When we presented a

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.750
paper at the end we said, "oh and by the
way you can play with the source code if

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.440
you want to." So we sort of released into
the wild, then a colleague that we knew a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.170
DreamWorks actually contacted us saying
well this looks kind of interesting. They

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.920
were working on Monsters vs Aliens and
our tool had actually made it in to production fast

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.280
enough that they used it for the final
sequence. So that was the first time we

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.630
got to see it on the screen. It was used
during the train crash sequence in Super

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.430
8. It was really exciting to find out about
that because when I first saw the movie

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.799
I didn't actually know it was used in that and it
was spectacular sequence in its own

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:24.100
right. But maybe my favorite movie going
experience was my colleagues had told me

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.360
beforehand that it actually was used in
Iron Man 3 so when me and my wife went

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.400
to go see it we actually both could
point at the screen at the exact moment

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.070
that it appeared, so we had that nice
little private moment in that theater.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.000
And that was a nice experience. Ever
wonder how filmmakers created special

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
effects before computers? Watch how it
was done during the silent era in this
