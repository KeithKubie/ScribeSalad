00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:11.345
THEIR MINDS.

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:12.813

OKAY, BUT THIS
SO-CALLED YOGA STUDIO

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.920
HAS TAKEN
AN ANCIENT INDIAN ART FORM

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.589
AND MUTATED IT
INTO [bleep] JAZZERCISE

00:00:22.623 --> 00:00:24.892
FOR RICH MOMS
AND HOMOSEXUALS.

00:00:24.925 --> 00:00:26.627

THIS BIG BOSS MAN, YOU KNOW.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.438
GUY WAS ACTING LIKE THE SECOND
COMING OF MASTER P, YOU KNOW?

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:39.940
YOU HEARD ME?
[laughs]

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.141
HE WAS A JERK.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:43.010
LOOKS LIKE A CALIFORNIA RAISIN.

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:45.145
- DO YOU LIKE LIVING
IN THAT CAVE OF YOURS?

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:49.216
HOW ABOUT YOU COME
OUT OF THE CAVE INTO THE LIGHT?

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:50.417
- PREACH.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.519
- AKA REALITY,
AKA CONSCIOUSNESS.

00:00:52.553 --> 00:00:53.754
- MM-HMM.

00:00:53.787 --> 00:00:55.189

I AM YOUR BITCH, SIR.
