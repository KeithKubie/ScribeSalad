00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.990
Alright, so we've got our two attendees. Johnny Concert and Misty Music.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.469
&gt;&gt; Yup.

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:05.720
&gt;&gt; And we've got our two festivals,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.480
ROFLpalooza and Cloudstock. I really like those names.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.480
&gt;&gt;

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.549
[LAUGH].

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:10.142
Me too.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:10.750
&gt;&gt;

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.000
&gt;&gt; But can you see the problem here?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.970
&gt;&gt; I mean, they don't have anything to do, like this festival doesn't

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.290
know anything about the attendees, so there's no way to like match them.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.140
&gt;&gt; Right. We don't know which festival either of those people are going to.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.460
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.040
&gt;&gt; So we'll need to relate those two tables.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.060
&gt;&gt; Okay. And so how do we, how do we do that? How do we think about that?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.960
&gt;&gt; So let's take a look at it on the tablet to make it a little more clear.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.680
&gt;&gt; So, start off by

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.720
looking at our festival object. We have the festival here. The, all of

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.290
the different field names. And then we

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.670
have individual records, like Cloudstock and ROFLpalooza.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.680
&gt;&gt; Right, right. And the fields were our columns. And, I get that.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.840
&gt;&gt; Yep.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.230
&gt;&gt; So, we could also think about what our attendee object could look like.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.480
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.150
&gt;&gt; Here we have same sort of thing. All of our

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.400
fields as the columns and then our records as the rows.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.870
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.680
&gt;&gt; But if we were trying to relate these two tables, we would need to create

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.550
a relationship field on one of them.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.550
&gt;&gt; Okay. So like, can I think of that as a new column?

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:05.510
&gt;&gt; Think of it as a new column in

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.360
the table, exactly. So, what would make more sense, to

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.130
add a column onto Attendees relating it to Festival, or

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.650
to add a column onto Festival relating it to Attendees?
