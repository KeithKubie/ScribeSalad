RACHAEL O'MEARA: Welcome
and thanks everyone

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.920
for coming today.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:04.860
I'm Rachel O'Meara.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.664
I'm based in San
Francisco, but I

00:00:06.664 --> 00:00:08.580
love to bring authors
to Mountain View and San

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.012
Francisco, because I think they
have authors and coaches, too,

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:14.470
in Mountain View
and San Francisco.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.930
There's a lot of good stuff
that they have to share.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.070
So I'm happy today to be in
Mountain View with all of you

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.850
and on video conference to
introduce Shir Nir who's

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.210
here today from New York.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.710
And today Shir, he's a partner
at the Handel Group, which

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.580
is a coaching firm that's
based throughout the country.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:38.350
What we're going
to talk about today

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.000
is how to get results
through personal integrity

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.880
and meaningful inner dialogue.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.030
So a little bit about Shir
before we get started.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.280
Shir brings more than 20
years of experience working

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.940
with executives, teams,
and organizations

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.460
to increase performance and
create organizational personal

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.950
and financial growth.

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.920
Throughout his career,
Shir has focused

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.630
on working with
senior executives

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.920
to expose and enhance
their innate abilities

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.569
to lead effectively.

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.340
And a fun fact that I'd
like to share about Shir

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.320
is that he also works
with the Burning Man team

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.150
and recently got a new option
to work with the entire Burning

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.270
Man staff to be better and
more effective leaders.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.120
So he's worked with Larry
Harvey and a few others there.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.230
So if any of you are in
the Burning Man crowd,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.280
he's also connected to that
group, as I am as well.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.410
And so today we're
going to cover the three

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.250
levels of personal
integrity that

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.610
are designed to be on the
path to design and obtain

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.900
measurable results.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.450
And how you can also understand,
based on the mastery of each,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.250
in succession creates
breakthrough performance.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.707
So without further ado
I'll hand it over to Shir

00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.540
to talk about this for
the rest of the hour.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.559
Thank you.

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:51.600
SHIR NIR: Well, thank you
very much for having me

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.070
here on your lunch.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.470
I appreciate your time,
and hopefully, I'm

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.022
going to reward
you for that time.

00:01:58.022 --> 00:01:59.480
Thank you, Rachael
for inviting me.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.390
It's a real pleasure and it's
real fun to be here today.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.270
I'll tell you a little bit-- you
can obviously detect an accent,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.530
and you can obviously,
I have a weird name,

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.374
so you don't have to
think where is he from?

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:15.040
I'm from Israel.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.620
I was born in Israel,
raised on the Kibbutz,

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.410
grew up working the fields, went
to the Israeli Special Forces,

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.210
and then came to the US.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:28.515
I've been in the US
for about 30 years now.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:32.340
I came with almost nothing,
worked my way through school,

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.050
and now I am part owner of
the Handel Group with my two

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.920
sisters-in-law.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.330
My two sisters-in-law
started with this company

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.890
nine years ago.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.765
And today, we have somewhere
about 65 people working for us.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:48.890
The Handel Group, I'll give
you a little background

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.540
about who we are and what
we do so you can have that

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.620
before I start talking
about the subject for today.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.060
The Handel Group has been
in business for nine years.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.720
We are very unique
in what we do.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.520
We are basically what we call
a coaching and consulting

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.060
company.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.340
And we're unique for two things.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.180
We're unique by the
structure we created,

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.960
and we are unique because
of our methodology,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.310
what we work on with people.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.630
So the first thing
is the structure.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.260
We have four main divisions in
the company, and two of them

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.230
are not traditional divisions.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.360
So the first one is a media
division and the media division

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.310
at our company what we do
is we actually focus on

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.450
media outlets to make
a difference to people

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.360
in the world.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.310
So we are working on TV shows.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.240
We working on radio shows.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.836
We working on contributing
to magazines and newspapers.

00:03:49.836 --> 00:03:52.640
Two of my colleagues were
just on the "Dr. Field Show"

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.140
working with a married
couple last week,

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.810
and it's going to air
in a couple of weeks.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.060
Oh, maybe it's aired
already, I'm not sure.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.810
But we have several
things in development.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.960
I'm a triathlete, so I'm working
with a producer, a Hollywood

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.190
producer, to create
a TV show where

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.450
I'm going to coach
returning vets from Vietnam.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.310
And we were going to coach them
both physically and mentally

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.900
at the same time.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.400
So we are really
committed to media

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.000
and to make a difference
through the media.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.170
The second part of
our media organization

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:37.010
is we're creating a digital
platform for our services.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.970
Obviously, for me to do
one-on-one or even group work,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.500
I can't get to enough people.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.850
Through digital media
and through creating

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:51.330
a digital platform, we can
reach a lot more people.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.485
So we're in the
process of doing it.

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:56.650
The complexity of
our program, it

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.620
makes it a lot longer and a lot
more complex to create that.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.970
But that's one of
our goals this year.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.360
The second division which is
very unique to our company

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.270
is we have an
education division.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.980
Nine years ago we made
actually a commitment

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.590
to make a difference
for students,

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:20.860
and we start teaching at MIT.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.070
We've been teaching
at MIT for nine

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.390
years about two to
three courses a year.

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.800
And since then we grew.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.400
We went to NYU, Columbia
University, Yale.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.010
We are in 38 universities.

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:37.140
The biggest thing
that we're doing

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.890
is we actually got to the
Stanford University Business

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.540
School and Medical School.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.650
And we teaching in the
Stanford Business School

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:50.280
for full credit, both
in undergraduate school

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.960
and the graduate school.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.830
And the course we call
Leading Your Life,

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.730
it's called in
Stanford University.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.860
And we do it every year.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:03.180
So that's education division.

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:07.530
We also work with us school
systems, the Palm Beach school

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:10.420
system, we've been working
with them for three years.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.050
And we work with some of
the New York school system.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.970
And really, in our
education division,

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:19.212
we are about to
make a difference.

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:20.670
It's all about
making a difference,

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:22.840
because as you know,
education doesn't

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.370
pay much money to
do those courses.

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:30.010
On top of those two divisions,
which are unique to what we do,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.550
we have a Life
Coaching division.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.630
In our Life Coaching division we
work with individual one-on-one

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.530
in workshops through
Skype all over the world.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:42.630
And in our Life
Coaching division,

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.150
we're really committed
to people's life.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.220
We have about 1,000 people we
work with on a daily basis,

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:55.875
on a weekly basis,
1,000 clients at a time.

00:06:55.875 --> 00:07:00.230
And again, we go to every
aspect of your life.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:04.790
Our goal is to really help
you enhance your life.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:08.730
Finally, the division
I run on a daily basis

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:09.960
is the corporate division.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.440
In the corporate division,
we do mainly four things.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.490
The first thing we do
is Executive Coaching,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:20.800
so we can work with any
executive in any level

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.670
and enhance their
abilities to succeed.

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:26.770
We mainly get called
for three reasons.

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.990
The most popular
reason is a CEO,

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:34.840
a VP, an executive wants to
increase their ability to lead,

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.570
and they want to
develop themselves,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.320
get themselves to the next
level, and we can do that.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.980
And we can do it with any
executive at any level,

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:48.100
because what we focus is not
on the traditional things.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.560
The second most popular
reason why we get called

00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.780
is because an executive did
something bad in the company.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.040
Something that is not allowed.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:02.656
Something that created
a mess and, as you know,

00:08:02.656 --> 00:08:05.320
that happens too often.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.600
So we get called in,
and we get called in

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.330
to help them clean it
up, get themselves back

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.400
into their position
of leadership,

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.370
and to start
succeeding from there.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.560
The third reason
why we get called

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.720
is because two executives
don't get along

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.890
and that takes down the
entire organization.

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:27.790
And when two executives
don't get along,

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.750
they really don't
produce results together.

00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:33.330
So we come in, and
we work with them.

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:37.690
We clean up the relationship,
and we put them back together

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:41.929
to work in partnership and
succeed in the business.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.810
So that's kind of the
Executive Coaching part.

00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:47.900
What we do with
executives one-to-one,

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.030
we can do with teams.

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:52.750
So we can take a
team and develop it.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:54.200
So we do our high potentials.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.580
We do leadership developments.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:59.030
We do team development.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:01.160
We do a lot of different
things like that.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:04.100
We also, some teams
make messes, so we

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:07.140
come and help them clean it
up, get back in integrity,

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.650
get back in accountability and
clean it up and go succeed.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:14.880
Sometimes two teams
don't get along,

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.410
and then that creates a mess.

00:09:17.410 --> 00:09:20.000
So as an example, I work
with an organization

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.950
where they're selling a
product, but a product

00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.880
came with service.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.520
The problem was
sales hated service,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:28.380
and service hated sales.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.640
Guess how were the sales?

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.320
Not very good.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.470
So after three years and
no increase in sales,

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:39.210
we started work with them,
and even within six months

00:09:39.210 --> 00:09:45.820
we produced 25% increase
in sales across the board,

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:48.740
just by fixing
that relationship.

00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:51.761
So that's what we do with teams.

00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:53.010
That's the second thing we do.

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:55.030
The third thing we
do is we actually

00:09:55.030 --> 00:10:00.970
can work with any team, and
within a short amount of time

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.150
increase their ability
to produce results.

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:04.350
So we did it in sales.

00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:06.300
We did in product to market.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.470
We did it with quality.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:12.530
We did it with cost of projects.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.500
So we can come in,
work with the team,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:21.140
and six months later or a
year later results are up.

00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.250
And the fourth, the
last thing that we do

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:26.910
is we take all these
together, and we

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:28.930
work with the
organization to call

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.220
to build what we
called honest cultures.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.180
Basically, to work
with the executive

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:39.480
to design and implement
a culture of honesty

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:42.130
and communication.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:44.610
So this is kind of
like what we do.

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:47.140
Now why we are so
successful at this

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.710
is what I'm going to
talk to you about today.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:52.990
Where we come
from, what we deal,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:56.150
what we work with
people on is different

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:58.170
than traditional things
that people work on.

00:10:58.170 --> 00:11:01.050
We do the traditional
stuff, too.

00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:04.000
We talk about communication.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.010
We talk about behaviors.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:08.920
We talk about a lot of things
that most people talk about.

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:11.890
But some of it is untraditional.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.850
So at the Handel
Group what we believe

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:20.780
is that happy people produce
happy result, period.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:27.200
And if you make an individual
happy, proud, inspired

00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.900
about every aspect
of their life,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.200
and I mean every
aspect of their lives,

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.160
that person shows up
to work differently.

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:40.270
That person start producing
result that are inconsistent,

00:11:40.270 --> 00:11:43.960
good inconsistent, with the
result they're producing now.

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:49.090
And all we did is make them
happy, and inspired, and proud.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.180
So in our work-- I've been
doing this for 20 years,

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.900
and some of the
executives in my company

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.775
have been doing it for
20 years, and the work

00:11:56.775 --> 00:11:58.830
that we've been
doing, what we found

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:01.820
is what it takes to
make a person proud,

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:06.200
inspired, and empowered about
their lives are several things.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:11.190
The first thing is connecting
you to your dreams.

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:16.910
So what we found consistently
with 100% of the people

00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:22.260
we work with that we,
as people, most of us,

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.700
are not connected to our dreams.

00:12:24.700 --> 00:12:26.520
We're connected to something.

00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:28.350
We're connected to some dreams.

00:12:28.350 --> 00:12:31.420
We're connected to dreams
in one or two areas,

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.280
but if I ask you
what's you dream

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:36.790
about specific
areas in your life,

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.760
you wouldn't know
what to tell me.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.730
Or what you told me would
be a somewhat made up story

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.110
that you created on the fly.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:51.440
So as people, as
we grow up, we get

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.620
disconnected from our dreams.

00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:56.830
And what we found is if
we actually do the work

00:12:56.830 --> 00:13:01.510
and tell the truth about what
you want, about what will make

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.430
you happy, about what
will make you proud,

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:10.210
all the time, you
will start seeing

00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.890
a picture that's
going to emerge.

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.530
And the more connected
you are to this picture,

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:17.280
the more successful you become.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.330
Why?

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.250
Because you're going to
start having a direction.

00:13:22.250 --> 00:13:26.020
So most of us, although we have
some direction in our life,

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:29.260
don't have a powerful
direction in our life.

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:32.720
So we spend time with people
to work on their dreams.

00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:39.950
The more detailed, the
more juicy, the more you're

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:44.950
connected to your dreams, the
more successful you become.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:46.290
That's number one.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:49.090
Number two, as
people, as we've seen,

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:54.410
is that as people, we are driven
by one thing and one thing

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.910
only.

00:14:00.965 --> 00:14:01.465
Results.

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:09.500
So we are driven by results
and we have results,

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.020
and we look for results in
every aspect of our lives.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:15.890
We measure everything by result.

00:14:15.890 --> 00:14:17.930
Results drive everything.

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:22.486
So some of you, like think
about three results you

00:14:22.486 --> 00:14:24.110
want to produce by
the end of the year,

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:26.510
however big or however
small they are.

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:30.200
Three results you want to
produce by the end of the year.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.935
Anybody, throw one
result you want

00:14:31.935 --> 00:14:33.351
to produce by the
end of the year.

00:14:37.222 --> 00:14:38.980
AUDIENCE: Purchase an
investment property.

00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.730
SHIR NIR: Purchase an
investment property.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.330
OK, good.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:44.760
Somebody else, one result
you want to produce, however

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.460
small or large.

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:47.462
AUDIENCE: Get promoted.

00:14:47.462 --> 00:14:48.420
SHIR NIR: Get promoted.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.710
OK, good, somebody else.

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:51.540
One result.

00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:55.570
AUDIENCE: Run the
Boston Marathon.

00:14:55.570 --> 00:14:57.169
SHIR NIR: OK, good.

00:14:57.169 --> 00:14:58.544
AUDIENCE: I'm
going to deter him.

00:14:58.544 --> 00:15:00.510
Find a renter for
my rental property.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.590
SHIR NIR: Find a renter
for your rental property.

00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:03.660
Good.

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:04.780
Run a marathon, good.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.890
Somebody else, one result
you want to produce,

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:08.960
however big it is.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:14.110
Get connected to some
of the results you want.

00:15:14.110 --> 00:15:17.920
I don't care if it's make
more money, buy a new car,

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.260
find a house, find the
man of your dreams,

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:24.360
find the woman of your dreams,
get engaged, get married,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.620
have a kid.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.080
It's always results,
results, results.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:28.710
Yes?

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:31.220
So in life what drives
us, how we think

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.620
about everything
is in result terms.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.630
Make sense?

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:43.090
And usually in life we
have result or we don't.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.990
We either have the result
by the end of the year,

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:50.250
if you want to find an
investment property,

00:15:50.250 --> 00:15:52.590
by the end of the year
you're either going to find

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:54.670
the investment
property or you won't.

00:15:54.670 --> 00:15:55.660
Yes?

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.100
And that's what happens in life.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:01.600
And the results you have in life
are a result of one thing only.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:08.470
The actions that you take.

00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:20.830
So give me one action that
will produce the result.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.052
AUDIENCE: Speak to a realtor.

00:16:23.052 --> 00:16:24.260
SHIR NIR: Speak to a realtor.

00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.050
OK, good.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:28.120
One action that produce
running a marathon.

00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.930
AUDIENCE: Training.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:29.721
SHIR NIR: Training.

00:16:29.721 --> 00:16:31.730
There you've got to get
a training schedule.

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:32.640
OK, good.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.826
One action that
produce a renter?

00:16:34.826 --> 00:16:36.539
AUDIENCE: Hounding
my property agent.

00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:37.330
SHIR NIR: OK, good.

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:40.374
Hounding your property agent.

00:16:40.374 --> 00:16:41.790
One action that
gets you promoted?

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:45.760
AUDIENCE: Taking initiatives.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.370
SHIR NIR: Taking
initiatives, good.

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:52.750
So those actions might get
you what you want, right?

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.610
You don't know.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:59.420
So action that we have we
define in three different ways.

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:02.650
The first do is very
clear, what you do.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:05.317
Everything you do
produces a result,

00:17:05.317 --> 00:17:07.150
whether it's going to
be the result you want

00:17:07.150 --> 00:17:11.349
or not, different question,
but everything you do

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:14.710
produces a result.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:18.819
The second thing is
what you don't do.

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:22.900
If you don't do something,
it also produces a result.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:24.920
So if you don't
train, and you're

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.760
going to show up
for the marathon,

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:28.770
it will have a result.

00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:31.440
Might not be the one you want.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.400
But it will have a result.

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.199
So what we do produces
a result, and what

00:17:35.199 --> 00:17:36.490
we don't do producers a result.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.310
And this is clear to everybody.

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.840
That's not even like a question.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:43.990
Everybody knows that
this is what you do.

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:45.710
Here's the third one.

00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:52.840
How do you do what you
do also has a result.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.330
So you can do something
in one way, which

00:17:56.330 --> 00:18:00.750
will produce one result, or you
could do exactly the same thing

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:03.820
in a different way, which would
produce a different result.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.110
You can have a conversation
in one way, even

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:12.240
say the same words, and it
will produce one result.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.250
You can have a conversation
in a different way

00:18:14.250 --> 00:18:16.230
will produce a different result.

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.010
If you're nice, it will
produce one result.

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.970
If you're nasty, it would
produce a different result.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:28.010
How you do what you do
makes a big difference.

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:32.520
So the likelihood that
you do that you actually

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:37.300
will produce a result is given
by not what you do or don't do,

00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.340
but also how you do what you do.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:41.710
Make sense?

00:18:41.710 --> 00:18:46.770
And if you work on these,
if you work on these,

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:49.890
it might not make a
lot of difference.

00:18:49.890 --> 00:18:52.190
It's this that would
make the most difference.

00:18:52.190 --> 00:18:57.660
Now this is also a result.

00:18:57.660 --> 00:19:02.010
Your action, what you do, what
you don't do, and how you do it

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:02.710
is a result.

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.120
Therefore, this is
very hard to change,

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:11.880
because it's a result
of how you think.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.080
So every thought
you have give you

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:22.970
an action, which
gives you a result.

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:25.315
In the Handel
Group, we don't say

00:19:25.315 --> 00:19:29.020
that you think, you actually
we call it inner dialogue.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.350
Because you don't
just think, you

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:36.820
talk to yourself all the time.

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:41.580
And even now, when I'm talking,
you're not listening to me,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:47.380
you listening to what you
say about what I say, period.

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:52.180
And that's the mechanic
of human beings.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:56.690
We talk, and we have an opinion,
or we have an interpretation,

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:01.730
and we say what we hear.

00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:03.705
So you're in a dialogue.

00:20:09.984 --> 00:20:10.650
Here's the boss.

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160
It dictates everything you
do, everything you don't do,

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.860
and how you do what you do.

00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:26.330
And it dictates the results you
can have in your life, period.

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.140
There's a guy named Dr. David
Hawkins, he's a little weird,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.140
I don't recommend
you read this book.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:37.240
He wrote a book called
"Power Versus Force,"

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.840
and he says couple interesting
things in that book,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.820
and what that's why
I'm quoting him.

00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:49.470
So David Hawkins said that
at best as humanity we

00:20:49.470 --> 00:21:03.540
are 60% negative and 40%
positive in a dialogue.

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.600
60% at best.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.930
He said we have people like
Gandhi, which are very,

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.890
very highly positive, and
people like Osama bin Laden that

00:21:11.890 --> 00:21:15.600
are very, very high
negative or low.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.560
But most of us as
people are at best 60%.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:25.220
So if you have a result
in mind, take a big result

00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:26.740
that you have in your mind, OK?

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:31.330
A big one that you want
by the end of the year.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:33.860
OK?

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:38.870
And think about what you need
to do to produce that result.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:41.160
So if you want a
investment property

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.740
by the end of the
year, if you want

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.365
to get promoted by
the end of the year,

00:21:44.365 --> 00:21:47.250
if you want to run a marathon
by the end of the year,

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:52.210
what do you need to do the
aggregate the whole thing?

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.330
What do you need to do
to make that happen?

00:21:54.330 --> 00:21:58.760
To think about that OK.

00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:01.280
People in your chairs,
think about your result

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.710
and what you need to do also.

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:04.390
OK.

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:10.420
Now think about why this
is happening this year.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.840
Why are you making
it happen here?

00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.540
Why this is going to have
a have and not a don't?

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:20.590
Think about that.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:24.151
Why is this result
happening this year?

00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:25.900
AUDIENCE: Do you mean
why is it important?

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.441
SHIR NIR: No.

00:22:26.441 --> 00:22:29.161
Why is it going to happen?

00:22:29.161 --> 00:22:29.660
Why?

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:31.050
AUDIENCE: You're assuming it's
definitely going to happen.

00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:32.210
SHIR NIR: I'm not assuming.

00:22:32.210 --> 00:22:33.240
I'm saying why?

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.480
So if she wants to get promoted,
I'll take-- you have one?

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:40.540
SHIR NIR: OK, if she
wants to get promoted,

00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.970
why is it happening this year?

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:46.230
Well, it's happening
because I already

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:47.740
have the project in mind.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:48.920
I got the team.

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.820
I know that if I do this
I'm going to get promoted.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.720
I already said it up is a
plan, everything is set.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.870
I am like, I'm getting
promoted, right?

00:22:57.870 --> 00:23:01.480
The why it's happening
is because I got it down.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.530
OK.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:05.980
So first thing, why
is it happening?

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:11.100
OK, now think, why
isn't it happening?

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.450
Why is the result not
happening till this year?

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:19.470
So why are you finding one, and
why are you not finding one?

00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:22.100
What are all the reasons
that you find one,

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.020
and what all the
reasons that you don't?

00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.240
What are all the reasons
that you get promoted?

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.850
And what are all the
reasons that you don't?

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.580
What are all the reasons
you running this marathon?

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:34.950
And all the reason
that you don't?

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:36.916
OK?

00:23:36.916 --> 00:23:38.310
AUDIENCE: With all the excuses.

00:23:38.310 --> 00:23:41.550
SHIR NIR: All the excuses,
all the reasons, right?

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:42.670
So tell me something.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.602
I don't care about the whys.

00:23:45.602 --> 00:23:47.810
I want to hear from you,
even from people that did it

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.237
in their heads, what did you see
about those two conversations

00:23:52.237 --> 00:23:53.570
that you just had with yourself?

00:23:56.916 --> 00:23:58.715
AUDIENCE: The first
one is exciting.

00:23:58.715 --> 00:24:01.340
The second one is safe.

00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:03.380
SHIR NIR: The first
one is exciting,

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:04.656
and the second one is safe?

00:24:04.656 --> 00:24:05.280
AUDIENCE: Safe.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.752
SHIR NIR: OK, good, what else?

00:24:07.752 --> 00:24:09.411
AUDIENCE: I feel
the first one is

00:24:09.411 --> 00:24:15.096
kind of internally, and
the second one [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:17.470
SHIR NIR: So the first one is
you take in accountability.

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:18.475
The other one is you--

00:24:18.475 --> 00:24:23.427
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] because
of other external reasons

00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:24.541
[INAUDIBLE].

00:24:24.541 --> 00:24:25.040
OK,

00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:26.706
SHIR NIR: So then
you're blaming others,

00:24:26.706 --> 00:24:28.680
you blame the environment,
you blame-- Good.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.180
Excellent.

00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.070
Accountability
versus blame, good.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:31.960
What else?

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:35.660
What else did you see
in that conversation?

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:38.060
AUDIENCE: Controllable
versus noncontrollable.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.790
SHIR NIR:
Controllables, say more.

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:41.410
AUDIENCE: Versus uncontrollable.

00:24:41.410 --> 00:24:41.750
SHIR NIR: Say more.

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.958
AUDIENCE: Like I was supposed
to run a 10K yesterday,

00:24:43.958 --> 00:24:46.440
but I didn't because
I got bronchitis.

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.260
That's uncontrollable.

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.810
So things like why you didn't
do something you wanted to do.

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:52.560
SHIR NIR: Perfect.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.570
That's similar to what he says.

00:24:54.570 --> 00:24:55.150
Perfect.

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:55.720
Right?

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.290
What else?

00:24:56.290 --> 00:24:59.401
AUDIENCE: Self-doubt
in the second one.

00:24:59.401 --> 00:25:00.276
SHIR NIR: Self-doubt?

00:25:00.276 --> 00:25:00.970
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:02.550
SHIR NIR: Yes.

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:03.420
OK, good.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:05.840
You're not doubting here,
and you're doubting here.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:06.520
Very good.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:07.936
AUDIENCE: I think,
in general, you

00:25:07.936 --> 00:25:10.360
have one or two strong
reasons why you would,

00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:14.200
but then you can come
up with a [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.560
SHIR NIR: Thank you.

00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.970
Much easier to
think of negative.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.010
Much easier.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:20.540
Right?

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:23.540
You can come with a
major list on why not,

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.370
and like this list
about why yes.

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:28.120
Yes?

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:31.350
And this is how we run
our life, and you guys

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:38.280
are successful with actually
80% negative dialogue

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.470
and 20% positive dialogue.

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:42.890
And it's not a bad thing.

00:25:42.890 --> 00:25:47.040
It's just that we, as people,
are designed to think why not,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.200
not why yes.

00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.555
We shoot ourself in the foot
and say let's go run a marathon.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.710
Now let's succeed, right?

00:25:58.710 --> 00:26:01.410
Our inner dialogue is the boss.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:05.370
It impacts all our actions.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:10.560
What we do, what we don't
do, and how we do it.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:15.830
It impacts all our results,
and mostly, we are negative.

00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:20.290
Mostly you come up with reasons
why not, not reasons why yes.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.490
So if you have something,
you immediately say,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:24.140
oh no, I'm not going
to get that one.

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.930
That's too hard.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.844
And why is that is
one, because you're not

00:26:28.844 --> 00:26:29.885
connected to your dreams.

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.500
But then the second
is because you're

00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.280
in a dialogue is
mostly negative.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.820
OK, so impacting
one's inner dialogue,

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:46.160
impacting the mechanism,
makes a huge difference.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:50.100
So when we work with people,
when we work with teams,

00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:55.030
when we work with companies, we
investigate the inner dialogue.

00:26:55.030 --> 00:26:57.500
We investigate the culture.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:01.580
We investigate what
runs the machine.

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.900
Now, the second thing that
David Hawkins said, not

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.330
only this thing is negative
and controls your actions

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:15.520
and your result, this is
how you derive energy.

00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.105
We, as people, are
an energy entity.

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:21.330
Right?

00:27:21.330 --> 00:27:23.080
We generate energy.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.580
Negative inner dialogue
equal negative energy.

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:29.590
Positive inner dialogue
equal positive energy.

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:30.790
You have that experience.

00:27:30.790 --> 00:27:32.450
You know that once
you go to people,

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:34.350
you can immediately see.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.750
You can feel the energy.

00:27:37.750 --> 00:27:39.440
You walk into a room
sometime and say,

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.930
what's going on in this room?

00:27:42.930 --> 00:27:46.570
Because the negative
dialogue is going in the room

00:27:46.570 --> 00:27:50.390
generates negative
energy and you feel it.

00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:53.200
I had one of my
clients and friend

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.290
came over with his
family this weekend.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:01.890
I have an apple
orchard, 30 apple trees

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.274
where I live in New York.

00:28:03.274 --> 00:28:05.190
And they came to pick
up apples with his kids,

00:28:05.190 --> 00:28:11.820
and they were in-- I could sense
that there's something going on

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.870
with them as a family.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:14.400
Right?

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.649
So this is something I'm
going to have to talk to him,

00:28:16.649 --> 00:28:18.730
but I sensed there was
something going on.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.370
Because you can sense that.

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.690
So negative energy,
and negative energy

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:25.300
you know that negative
energy doesn't

00:28:25.300 --> 00:28:28.050
attract anything
but negative energy.

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.890
So as long as your inner
dialogue is negative, as long

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:33.300
as you're generating
negative energy,

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:36.030
the only thing you can
get is negative results.

00:28:36.030 --> 00:28:40.510
Now, obviously, it's in a scale.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:41.700
It's not that bad.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.130
It's not bad, but
it's not great.

00:28:45.130 --> 00:28:49.900
So one way to impact results
is start impacting this.

00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:52.610
You impact this, you
impact the entire thing.

00:28:52.610 --> 00:28:56.610
Now, impacting this is
hard, and why is it hard?

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:01.380
Because your inner
dialogue is automatic.

00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.060
You don't say, oh, let
me think negatively now.

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.440
You don't say I want
to think this way

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.480
about her or about him.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.380
You just think, you
like you breathe.

00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.980
OK, and why your
negative inner dialogue,

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.280
or your inner
dialogue is automatic

00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.260
is because your
inner dialogue is

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:25.460
a result of three main sources.

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:27.525
Number one.

00:29:27.525 --> 00:29:28.025
Traits.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:38.180
Traits, behavioral
traits, You have traits.

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.959
We all have traits.

00:29:39.959 --> 00:29:41.000
They are inherent in you.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.610
They're hard wired.

00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:49.430
They come from two people,
mom and dad, and unfortunately

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:53.360
guys and girls, you are your
mom and you are your dad.

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.340
And you can't escape that.

00:29:55.340 --> 00:29:58.900
And your kids, they're
going to be you.

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.150
It's in your lineage.

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:02.410
We have traits.

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:05.220
I get annoyed by people
just like my mom get annoyed

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:07.040
with people.

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.580
I'm tough just like
my mom is tough.

00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:11.780
Right?

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:15.890
So you get your
mom's and your dad's

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:18.080
traits, the good ones
and the bad ones.

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.270
Right?

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:24.400
Now, traits are tricky,
because traits come in two,

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.610
obviously, sounds.

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:28.100
Negative and positive.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:32.310
Negative traits lead to negative
inner dialogue, negative action

00:30:32.310 --> 00:30:34.440
and negative result.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.520
One of my negative
traits is I get annoyed.

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.110
The minute I get annoyed, the
only thing I can think about,

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:42.500
you're annoying me.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.420
Get the hell out of my face.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.210
Right?

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:47.970
The only thing I
can do is be nasty,

00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:52.470
and the only result I can
produce is not very good.

00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:57.240
So traits produce negative
results if they're negative.

00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:59.870
The problem with traits and here
are the problem with traits.

00:30:59.870 --> 00:31:03.120
They could be negative
in one context

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.440
and positive in another.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.430
And that's tricky.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:12.620
OK, so one of my negative
traits that I found out about

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:15.790
is I am tough.

00:31:15.790 --> 00:31:19.450
OK, grew up in the Kibbutz
in Israel, work in the fields

00:31:19.450 --> 00:31:22.430
since I'm 10, went to
Israeli Armed Forces,

00:31:22.430 --> 00:31:26.170
was in a special forces
unit, came to the States

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:29.120
with nothing, put myself
through business school,

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:31.330
started company.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.940
Sold the company, joined my two
sisters-in-law, and here I am.

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:36.700
OK, I'm tough.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.900
I could take it.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:42.520
My favorite thing to do
was Ironman Triathlons.

00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:47.630
At age 45 I participated in
the first inaugural Ironman

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:51.020
Triathlon after not being
a competitive athlete

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:52.530
in my entire life.

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:53.420
OK?

00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:57.630
So I'm tough, and it's
good when I do triathlons

00:31:57.630 --> 00:31:59.930
because I can run forever.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:03.250
But it's not good
when I'm a dad.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:10.010
So seven years ago when my
son was 10, I did a study.

00:32:10.010 --> 00:32:13.860
And my study was I asked my wife
and my daughter, my daughter

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:20.180
was-- my son was 10, my daughter
was six and my wife I said,

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.840
how much do you feel
that I love you?

00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.690
Not how much do you know.

00:32:24.690 --> 00:32:26.300
How much do you feel
that I love you?

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.060
So my daughter was
very generous to me,

00:32:28.060 --> 00:32:29.450
she gave me a six out of 10.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:36.100
My son and my wife
gave me a two.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.630
And that was a slap in the face.

00:32:39.630 --> 00:32:41.070
OK.

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:43.670
So that wasn't good, and
the reason why I got a two

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.700
was because I was tough.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:46.460
I was tough.

00:32:46.460 --> 00:32:48.050
I was not nice to my son.

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.195
He didn't feel like
I cared for him.

00:32:52.195 --> 00:32:53.528
I gave him everything he wanted.

00:32:53.528 --> 00:32:58.620
He had everything he wants,
but except love and attention.

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.840
So I had to change that.

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:01.440
And I did.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.900
I actually created a plan
with him, and in two weeks,

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:05.610
I was an eight.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:13.080
But I had to maintain
it for a year,

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.130
and every time I didn't
maintain that, I didn't

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.089
get an eight from him, I
had a consequence to pay.

00:33:18.089 --> 00:33:19.380
And this is part of our method.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:22.940
What we do is we
create a mechanism.

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.130
My consequence was,
you'll think it's silly,

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:31.190
I used to ride 180 miles
on a bike every week.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:34.840
And I love my bike
clean, loved it's clean.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:39.500
So every time I rode it, I
would clean it for half an hour.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:41.980
And I couldn't clean
my bike for a week

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.980
if I didn't get an
eight from my son.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:46.090
It killed me.

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:49.470
It happened once, and then
it didn't happen again.

00:33:49.470 --> 00:33:54.490
So traits impact your
thinking, impact your action,

00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.000
impact your results.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.810
So one of the things you
need to start looking at

00:33:58.810 --> 00:34:03.980
is you can start looking and
exploring to your traits.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.100
One of the things you
need is a sense of humor

00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:11.400
like, this is the ceiling, this
is the floor, and I'm tough.

00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:14.670
This is the ceiling, this is
the floor, and I'm annoyed.

00:34:14.670 --> 00:34:15.750
So we have traits.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:20.280
So one of the things we
do is we call them names.

00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:26.800
And we then work to
identify how they work.

00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:31.469
Because if the trait hits, and
you already have the thought,

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:34.489
took reaction, and you
now in the result of it,

00:34:34.489 --> 00:34:37.800
very, very hard to
take it all way back.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.650
Now if you learn
about that trait,

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:45.340
and you can detect it here
when it only shows its head up,

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.100
and you cut the
head off, you then

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.429
prevented this entire
thing from happening.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:54.409
So one of the
things we recommend

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.070
is get to know yourself.

00:34:57.070 --> 00:34:58.950
The more you know
yourself, the more you

00:34:58.950 --> 00:35:02.110
would admit to yourself
about your traits,

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:04.940
the more you're going
to evolve consistent

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:07.420
with the results you
want in your life.

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:09.410
And traits are
one of the sources

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:14.440
of all your inner dialogue,
which then impact what you do,

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:17.250
what you don't do,
and how you do it,

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:20.650
which then impacts the
results you have in your life.

00:35:20.650 --> 00:35:22.980
The second one is your beliefs.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.050
And I'll do the second
and third together,

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.470
because they're similar.

00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:31.893
The third is theories.

00:35:34.830 --> 00:35:37.710
So you may wonder what's the
difference between beliefs

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.690
and theories?

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.390
Beliefs are pretty much I
believe you're a good guy.

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.340
I believe this room is great.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.650
Theories are more equation like.

00:35:48.650 --> 00:35:53.710
If I go down that road, and
I could beat the traffic,

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.600
and then I can get
there ahead of it,

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.280
and then I will be
it there on time.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.130
Theories are more
equation like, right?

00:36:01.130 --> 00:36:07.000
So beliefs and theories
are not hard wired.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.570
You created them.

00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:15.540
You created them from learning,
experience, and observation.

00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.750
Could be your dad said
something, could be you

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:21.410
read something, or you
experience something.

00:36:21.410 --> 00:36:24.270
You created and
you have thousands

00:36:24.270 --> 00:36:27.330
of beliefs and
thousands of theories.

00:36:27.330 --> 00:36:30.040
You have beliefs and
theories about everything,

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.590
about people, about food,
about rooms, about companies,

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:39.810
about cultures, about
anything, about curtains.

00:36:39.810 --> 00:36:42.700
And those beliefs
and theories come

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:50.770
in two ways, in two sounds,
negative and positive.

00:36:50.770 --> 00:36:53.740
And the problem is with
beliefs and theories

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:59.250
is that you are constructed
to prove all of your beliefs

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.230
and theories correct, period.

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:06.440
If I ask you everything you
believe, and you could tell me

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.535
what you believe, and I
ask you to give evidence

00:37:09.535 --> 00:37:12.455
for that belief, you
will find evidence.

00:37:12.455 --> 00:37:15.260
A lot of evidence.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.880
If one day you
change your belief,

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.720
you will find a lot of
evidence with that belief.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:25.390
So as people, we are created to
prove our beliefs and theories

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:30.560
correct, which means that if
you have a negative belief,

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.040
you will find evidence for that.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.550
You will believe that.

00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:39.000
It will impact you in a dialogue
it will impact what you do

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.560
and it impact your results.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:53.860
These three are basically the
source of all your performance.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:56.100
The source of all your results.

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.600
They dictate what
results you can produce,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.100
and they dictate what
results you can't produce

00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:04.890
in a combination
or by themselves.

00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:09.510
So the trait can go by
itself an impact it,

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:14.900
or it could be a trait with
two beliefs and three theories,

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:22.410
all working together
to create a one result.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:27.060
Basically this,
inner dialogue, is

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:32.790
the medium by which your traits,
beliefs, and theories show up,

00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:35.750
and the way that they
impact your action.

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:48.135
We call this your reality.

00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:55.070
Or another way to
say it, your truth.

00:38:55.070 --> 00:38:57.260
This is what's true to you.

00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.990
This is what you believe
is the truth about life.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:03.930
And it's given by your
traits, beliefs, and theories

00:39:03.930 --> 00:39:07.840
coming into the way you think.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:10.730
In company, by the
way, it's the culture.

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:18.970
Between two people
is a relation.

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:24.720
My reality about him
and his reality about me

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.720
gives us our relationship
and makes everything

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:33.050
that's possible or
impossible between us.

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:36.760
How we relate to
things is our reality.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:39.370
Our reality is made
out of all our traits,

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:41.120
all our beliefs,
all our theories,

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:46.770
which is a compilation of
our history and who we are,

00:39:46.770 --> 00:39:51.380
and our experiences
and our traits.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.675
And that is extremely complex.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:02.750
So our reality is the
source of every result

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:06.800
that you can produce, period.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.720
So if you want to
have different result,

00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.810
if you want to have more sales,
if you want to make more money,

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:15.450
if you want to move to
another career, if you want to

00:40:15.450 --> 00:40:18.480
have a new profession,
whatever you want.

00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:20.550
If you want to find
you want to find

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.040
the love of your life,
what you need to work on

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:26.310
is not your action.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.545
What you need to work
on is your reality.

00:40:31.750 --> 00:40:34.342
Now what would you work on?

00:40:34.342 --> 00:40:35.580
It's a good question.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:44.330
First, we say design your
dreams, design your life.

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:48.290
So we believe that your life
exists in 18 different areas,

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:49.950
and if you actually
tell the truth

00:40:49.950 --> 00:40:54.080
about each one of those
areas, a picture emerges.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.950
And when you design
your dream and tell

00:40:55.950 --> 00:40:57.960
the truth about
your dream, you take

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.280
that design and you put it here.

00:41:03.570 --> 00:41:05.450
And you ask yourself
what reality

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:09.910
would enable this design
to show up as a result.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:13.950
If I dream of this, what's
the reality that I need

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:18.060
to create that would enable me
to take the actions that will

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:19.860
produce the result
I want in my life.

00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:25.640
And if you do this,
you will start

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.720
seeing results showing up.

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.835
We call this model.

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:39.863
The integrity/accountability
model.

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:47.150
Why do we call it the
integrity/accountability model?

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.950
So what we believe is
that if you actually

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:57.944
take the case that you can
design and author every result

00:41:57.944 --> 00:41:58.860
you want in your life.

00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.530
You can actually
design and author

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:03.400
every result you
have in your life,

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:07.340
and you know it because you
have the experience of it.

00:42:07.340 --> 00:42:10.410
You just don't remember, and
mostly you don't do that.

00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:13.440
As people, we don't
author everything.

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:16.610
Or actually, we author
some things we don't want.

00:42:16.610 --> 00:42:21.190
So if you take the case that
if you design and author

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:23.880
every result you
want in your life,

00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.970
and you take a case
that the only thing that

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:29.410
will produce that result,
the only thing that produce

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.570
that result is what you
do, what you don't do,

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:35.140
and how you do it.

00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:36.250
It's all on you.

00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:42.535
Then you could start
seeing your accountability

00:42:42.535 --> 00:42:45.240
in the matter for
every result you want.

00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:47.280
It's the good news
and the bad news.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.800
The good news is
you're accountable,

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:52.090
the bad news is
you're accountable.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.430
And if you shift, it will shift.

00:42:55.430 --> 00:43:01.160
And you will start believing
that your actions, what you do,

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.400
what you don't
do, and how you do

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.080
it is a function of one
thing and one thing on only.

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:11.240
Your inner dialogue,
and your inner dialogue

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:14.140
is a function of your traits,
beliefs, and theories,

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:17.380
and that your inner dialogue
beliefs, theories and traits

00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:20.640
make up your reality,
if you believe that,

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:25.890
and you start aligning
these together,

00:43:25.890 --> 00:43:29.540
this is what we what we
call your accountability.

00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:32.990
So maybe if you start
considering that maybe,

00:43:32.990 --> 00:43:36.730
maybe, maybe, maybe just you.

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:39.870
And maybe if you actually start
telling the truth about what

00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:43.720
you want, and you get
connected, and you

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.980
hold yourself
accountable, you can

00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:48.330
have everything you
want in your life.

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:50.800
And I mean everything
you want your life.

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:56.170
Integrity is because
we believe that there's

00:43:56.170 --> 00:43:59.760
a level of integrity
that has to exist

00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.910
between your design
and your result that

00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:04.300
includes your reality.

00:44:04.300 --> 00:44:06.210
The integrity that
needs to exist

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.080
exists in three
different levels.

00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.360
First level is what we
call physical integrity.

00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:15.100
What's physical integrity?

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.980
Physical integrity is
the physical aspect

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:21.230
of what needs to happen for
every result to show up.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:23.920
So if he wants to
run a marathon,

00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.900
there's certain
distances that he

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:30.380
needs to run to
finish a marathon.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:35.240
If he doesn't get
himself trained,

00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:37.440
the likely that is going
to finish the marathon

00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:41.270
running is going to
be not very good.

00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:44.520
Because the physical reality,
the physical integrity

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.760
has to exist.

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:52.100
The bottle is a physical
integrity that holds the water.

00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.830
No bottle, water's going
to spill on the floor.

00:44:55.830 --> 00:44:59.290
Physical integrity
is complex and large.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.610
If you build a power
plant, you need

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.120
a lot of physical integrity.

00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:06.320
Physical integrity has
to do with coordination,

00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:09.442
with processes, with
practices, with skills.

00:45:09.442 --> 00:45:11.150
Physical integrity
has to do with people,

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:12.840
like keeping your promises.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.390
If you said you're going to
be somewhere, be somewhere.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.320
That's physical integrity.

00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.800
Any breakdown in
physical integrity,

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.210
however big or small, causes
a breakdown in results.

00:45:25.210 --> 00:45:28.410
So if you want the
result, you want

00:45:28.410 --> 00:45:30.730
to figure out what's the
physical integrity that

00:45:30.730 --> 00:45:33.590
will produce this result.

00:45:33.590 --> 00:45:36.240
Number one.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:38.200
Second level of integrity.

00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:41.760
The second level of integrity
we call emotional integrity.

00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.280
What's emotional integrity?

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.400
Emotional integrity has
nothing to do with physicality

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.770
of the result you
want to produce.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.650
Nothing to do with the
physical integrity.

00:45:52.650 --> 00:45:55.210
It has to do with you.

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:59.510
It has to do with your
beliefs and your theories.

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:04.280
It has to do with, even if you
have the physical integrity,

00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.680
and you don't
trust your partner,

00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.520
how well are you going
to produce the results?

00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:12.960
Not very well.

00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.640
If you have a fight
with somebody,

00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:17.940
and you need to go and do
a presentation together,

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:21.180
how good is the
presentation going to be?

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.310
Not very good.

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:27.320
If I look at physical integrity
and emotional integrity

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:31.560
in the context of Ironman
which I used to do

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:37.130
is the physical integrity will
get me to finish the Ironman.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:40.480
And you need a lot of physical
integrity to finish it.

00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:44.060
Emotional integrity will
get me to do many Ironmans,

00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:46.820
and then be good at this,
because I am emotionally

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:50.660
connected, I believe in
myself, I love doing it,

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:51.840
and I enjoy it.

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:58.060
Emotionally integrity makes
the results higher, bigger,

00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:58.590
and better.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:04.170
The more emotional
integrity that you have,

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.340
the more result you're
going to produce as a person

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:09.850
and as a team.

00:47:09.850 --> 00:47:12.559
Team emotional integrity
is extremely important.

00:47:12.559 --> 00:47:14.600
The more you get along,
the more you collaborate,

00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.950
the more you work together,
the more result you're

00:47:16.950 --> 00:47:17.920
going to be producing.

00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:22.030
Emotional integrity
could sometime

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.620
cover breakdowns in
physical integrity.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.120
So sometime, even if there's
no physical integrity,

00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:31.280
if you have a high
emotional integrity,

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:35.360
results are going to show up,
because energetically you're

00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:38.650
going to call in
certain things and make

00:47:38.650 --> 00:47:41.290
certain things possible.

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:45.390
The last level is what we
call spiritual integrity.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.740
Spiritual integrity
is when you are

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.200
at the highest
level, or individual,

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.240
when we are at the highest
level of our physical

00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.310
and emotional integrity.

00:47:55.310 --> 00:48:00.150
When our physical and emotional
integrity are at high levels,

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.680
we get to a point where we can
start to see as human beings,

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.920
and you may have that
experience that you

00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.680
are the source of everything.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:13.700
That really you create
the results around you.

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:17.340
That when you show up,
and how you show up,

00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:21.060
impacts everyone and
impacts everything.

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:25.700
This is very hard for us to
get as people, very hard,

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:28.690
but when you get
that, you then can

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:31.300
show up consistently or
at least consistently

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.430
work to get yourself
up to that level.

00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:37.920
And this is when you
get there, it's awesome,

00:48:37.920 --> 00:48:42.120
because you literally start
seeing how the world falls

00:48:42.120 --> 00:48:45.980
and how you show up, and how you
make a difference in the world.

00:48:45.980 --> 00:48:49.330
For a team, spiritual
integrity has

00:48:49.330 --> 00:48:56.530
to do with the connection
or the alignment of all

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.650
the emotional integrity.

00:48:57.650 --> 00:49:00.740
So one of the things I've
been doing with my company

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.040
is we create something
called the mastermind.

00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:07.540
Mastermind came from a guy named
Napoleon Hill who wrote books

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.770
in the 20s, and he used to
work with people like Carnegie

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.770
and Ford and some of those guys.

00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:19.760
And one of the things,
he wrote a book called,

00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:26.100
"The Secret of Success in 16
Chapters", and he wrote a book,

00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.520
and he actually worked
with those guys,

00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.080
and he created a
mastermind with them.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.020
And what he said
that nobody knows

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.780
is those guys used
to meet once a month,

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:40.150
and they created a team of
very successful entrepreneurs

00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:43.410
that were committed to
each other's success.

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.380
And once a month they
used to get together

00:49:45.380 --> 00:49:50.210
and they use to help
each other with their

00:49:50.210 --> 00:49:53.360
with their personal
aims and personal goals.

00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:57.770
So a mastermind is created or
spiritual integrity in a team

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:01.620
is created when all the
emotional integrity is aligned,

00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:04.840
where everybody's moving
in the same direction.

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:08.130
Your personal goals fits
with the team goals,

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.900
and the team goals fits
your personal goals.

00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:13.530
When that happens,
the team is successful

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:15.930
no matter how bad the market is.

00:50:15.930 --> 00:50:19.040
The company's successful no
matter how bad the market is.

00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.510
You know that there are some
companies that consistently

00:50:22.510 --> 00:50:25.240
excel no matter
how the market is,

00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.090
and that has nothing to
do with anything else

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:31.710
other than the team and
the people in the company

00:50:31.710 --> 00:50:33.880
are just working differently.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:36.900
And they drive the
success of the company.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:41.610
So what we say is,
if you continuously

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:46.530
work, design your dreams,
understand yourself as a human

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:52.820
being, who you are and how you
think, look at your traits,

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:55.010
look at those traits
that don't work.

00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:58.380
The ones that get
you in trouble,

00:50:58.380 --> 00:51:04.430
the ones that get
you off the mark.

00:51:04.430 --> 00:51:06.120
Look at your
beliefs and theories

00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:08.640
and see how my beliefs and
theories are enabling me

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.520
or disabling me.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:14.090
And if they disable
you, get rid of them.

00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:17.060
Why do you need them?

00:51:17.060 --> 00:51:18.730
They only disable you.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:25.420
And start aligning your
reality with your dreams,

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:30.990
sooner or later you're going
to get your results to go up.

00:51:30.990 --> 00:51:34.480
So that's kind of it.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.020
I'll give you time
to ask questions,

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.366
and I would be glad
to answer any of them.

00:51:40.366 --> 00:51:43.530
You've got five minutes.

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:46.220
Wow, I thought I had more time.

00:51:46.220 --> 00:51:47.310
So any questions?

00:51:47.310 --> 00:51:49.034
AUDIENCE: Can you
talk a little bit

00:51:49.034 --> 00:51:52.040
on the designing your
life bit and connecting

00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.584
that to impacting
your inner dialogue?

00:51:55.584 --> 00:51:57.000
Like, how do you
design-- what are

00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.850
like quick reasons [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:02.520
SHIR NIR: So what are quick
ways to design your life?

00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:09.860
A quick way to design your
life is really tell the truth.

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.280
It's hard for people to design
life, because most of us

00:52:12.280 --> 00:52:15.850
think that we know
what we want, right?

00:52:15.850 --> 00:52:18.600
But really tell the
truth and go down deep,

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:25.060
and say to yourself, OK, in this
area what would I really want?

00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:27.290
What's my dream?

00:52:27.290 --> 00:52:34.390
And put away all the nos, and
I can't, and all that noise.

00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:36.840
What if you can get
anything you want?

00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:39.410
What would you want to get?

00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:40.830
Not a pie in the sky.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:44.860
I want to be a millionaire
in five minutes.

00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:46.270
It's not going to happen.

00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:50.950
But you know,
something reasonable.

00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:53.570
I want to have a community
of people that love me.

00:52:53.570 --> 00:52:58.140
I want to have my own company.

00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:01.324
I want to help
people doing this.

00:53:01.324 --> 00:53:03.240
There's a lot of different
things in your life

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:07.200
that you really can
see and that you want.

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.720
And the only thing
that stands between you

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:15.920
is I don't have enough time,
who am I to want these things.

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:21.210
On this, on that, they I can't,
I won't, and all that stuff.

00:53:21.210 --> 00:53:25.540
So your life, there are
certain things in your life

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.900
that you made happen, right?

00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:32.600
That were not easy
to make happen.

00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:34.640
Get connected to them first.

00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:36.450
See where you made
something happen

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:38.270
that wasn't going
to happen anyway.

00:53:38.270 --> 00:53:41.350
Get connected to your
ability to author something.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:47.670
And then go and answer the
question, if I wanted anything

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:48.960
in my life, what would I want?

00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.480
And then look at
different areas.

00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.140
Look at love, look at
intimacy, look at friendships,

00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:55.970
look at career,
look at money, look

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:59.210
at every aspect of your
life, and then start

00:53:59.210 --> 00:54:03.510
designing each one
on its own and give

00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:05.728
as much details as possible.

00:54:05.728 --> 00:54:08.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
October weekend?

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:12.400
SHIR NIR: We have a, by the
way, a Designing Your Life

00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:17.110
weekend in Menlo Park
October 19 and 20

00:54:17.110 --> 00:54:19.680
that is given by my
Life Coaching division,

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:24.250
and we have some brochures here,
and you can go online and look

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:28.810
at it as well if this is
something you're interested in.

00:54:28.810 --> 00:54:29.440
Yes.

00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:30.913
AUDIENCE: Some of
the examples you

00:54:30.913 --> 00:54:32.386
gave in the beginning of
your coaching practice?

00:54:32.386 --> 00:54:32.877
SHIR NIR: Yes.

00:54:32.877 --> 00:54:33.859
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
situational.

00:54:33.859 --> 00:54:35.823
Like with companies in
a particular situation,

00:54:35.823 --> 00:54:40.310
and I'm curious when you
bring such a broad perspective

00:54:40.310 --> 00:54:44.910
to a situation, can you
talk about some instances?

00:54:44.910 --> 00:54:47.250
I mean, it seems like
you have, in one sense,

00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:50.270
you have a commitment
to solve a situation,

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.180
but what you're bringing
is a lot broader.

00:54:53.180 --> 00:54:54.750
And it seems like
sometimes you might

00:54:54.750 --> 00:54:57.375
get results that are completely
inappropriate for what you were

00:54:57.375 --> 00:54:59.670
brought in for, like
an executive realizes

00:54:59.670 --> 00:55:02.470
this is totally what
they want to do in life.

00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:04.415
How you deal with--
can you give examples,

00:55:04.415 --> 00:55:06.830
or can you talk about
those kind [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:08.880
SHIR NIR: Yeah, so
usually and executive

00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.950
that come to a conclusion like
this is something they totally

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:16.680
didn't want to do
in their lives,

00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:18.420
actually, finally
telling the truth.

00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.600
So mostly, those executives
are not as successful

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.420
as they could be.

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.840
So telling the truth is
actually good for both

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.310
of them and their bosses.

00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:31.600
Because why they're
not producing

00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.260
is because they're
not connecting.

00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.570
Why they're not producing
is because they're

00:55:35.570 --> 00:55:39.530
not happy and is because
that's not their dreams.

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:42.550
So when you move
a person like this

00:55:42.550 --> 00:55:44.340
and get them connected
to their dreams,

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.450
and they finally go and do
what they really love to do,

00:55:48.450 --> 00:55:51.450
they excel.

00:55:51.450 --> 00:55:54.870
And then you could put
somebody else in their position

00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:59.169
who can excel, too,
because it's their dreams.

00:55:59.169 --> 00:56:00.460
Does that answer your question?

00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:01.110
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:01.110 --> 00:56:05.800
SHIR NIR: So our method is
really about telling the truth.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.920
And we believe that if
you tell the truth, which

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.350
a lot of time
executives and company

00:56:10.350 --> 00:56:14.590
don't, because they're afraid
of whatever is going to happen.

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:18.500
If you tell the truth, you
can work out everything.

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.970
And when you tell
the truth, and you

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:23.970
deal with the truth
with integrity,

00:56:23.970 --> 00:56:26.530
your ability to take the
business to the next level

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:28.430
is going to increase.

00:56:28.430 --> 00:56:30.780
And we've seen it over,
and over, and over again

00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:32.510
in businesses.
