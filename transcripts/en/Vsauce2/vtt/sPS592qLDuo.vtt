Stranger Visions is a project by Heather Dewey-Hagborg
where she uses DNA to create portrait sculptures

of people she has never met.

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:23.970
To create them she collected DNA from cigarette
butts, hair, gum, and other sample and then

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.210
used software to translate the DNA into computer
models and made 3D printed sculptures.

so they overlooked everything.
