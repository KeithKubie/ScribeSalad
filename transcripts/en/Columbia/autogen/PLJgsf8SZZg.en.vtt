into the environment and we developed
 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.399
into the environment and we developed

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.170
the 1970s and 1980s one of the problems
here is that conceptually this is what

locked in this idea in people's minds
 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.490
locked in this idea in people's minds
that there was a trade-off between

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
that there was a trade-off between
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.249

growth retrofits added cost to the
 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.310
growth retrofits added cost to the
production process okay you you had your

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320
production process okay you you had your
 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.340

you didn't think about and you didn't

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630
you didn't think about and you didn't
 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.819
you didn't think about and you didn't
worry about and you didn't pay for so

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829
worry about and you didn't pay for so

then it got thrown into the waterways

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739
then it got thrown into the waterways
 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:21.160
then it got thrown into the waterways
and then we dug a big hole for it in

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170
and then we dug a big hole for it in
 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.110
and then we dug a big hole for it in
Staten Island and we didn't we put it

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120
Staten Island and we didn't we put it
 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.750
Staten Island and we didn't we put it
there then the hole got filled up and

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760
there then the hole got filled up and
 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.720
there then the hole got filled up and
now we send it to holes in the ground in

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
now we send it to holes in the ground in
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.809
now we send it to holes in the ground in
Virginia and Pennsylvania but and and

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819
Virginia and Pennsylvania but and and
 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.910
Virginia and Pennsylvania but and and
now the cost of these things is going up

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920
now the cost of these things is going up
 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.930
now the cost of these things is going up
so we have to start paying some

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940
so we have to start paying some
 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.770
so we have to start paying some
attention to that but environmental

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780
attention to that but environmental
 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.750
attention to that but environmental

you start to think about pollution as a

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290
you start to think about pollution as a
 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.509

form of waste
 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:59.680
form of waste
if pollution is waste then if I can

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690
if pollution is waste then if I can
 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.830
if pollution is waste then if I can
produce less waste then I can make more

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840
produce less waste then I can make more
 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.729

down the production line and then at the
 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.870
down the production line and then at the
end of the production line if the

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880
end of the production line if the
 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.720

three weeks I brought it in for the
 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.850
three weeks I brought it in for the
first checkup and they know they fixed

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860
first checkup and they know they fixed
 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.310

I was a happy customer what do I know
so then I bought a Honda in the mid-80s

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460
so then I bought a Honda in the mid-80s
 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.879
so then I bought a Honda in the mid-80s
and they I finished the deal and I say

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889
and they I finished the deal and I say
 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.860
and they I finished the deal and I say
to the Honda dealer so I'll keep a pad

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870
to the Honda dealer so I'll keep a pad
 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.270
to the Honda dealer so I'll keep a pad
on the seat next to me and I'll write

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280
on the seat next to me and I'll write
 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.129
on the seat next to me and I'll write
down anything that's wrong with the car

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139
down anything that's wrong with the car
 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.409
down anything that's wrong with the car
and you guys will fix it right and the

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:05.419
and you guys will fix it right and the
 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:06.879
and you guys will fix it right and the
guy looked at me like I had done

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:06.889
guy looked at me like I had done
 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:10.510
guy looked at me like I had done
something horrible to him and he said he

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520
something horrible to him and he said he
 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.890
something horrible to him and he said he
said there will be nothing wrong with

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:11.900
said there will be nothing wrong with
 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.740
said there will be nothing wrong with
this car this car is perfect and so yeah

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750
this car this car is perfect and so yeah
 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.140
this car this car is perfect and so yeah
he's a car salesman that's perfect so I

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150
he's a car salesman that's perfect so I
 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.879
he's a car salesman that's perfect so I
drove around for several weeks with the

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889
drove around for several weeks with the
 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.040
drove around for several weeks with the
pad and there's nothing on it the car is

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:21.050
pad and there's nothing on it the car is
 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.200
pad and there's nothing on it the car is
perfect and started to occur to me that

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210
perfect and started to occur to me that
 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.320
perfect and started to occur to me that
when I bought the the Duster I was still

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330
when I bought the the Duster I was still
 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.480
when I bought the the Duster I was still
helping to make the car I was the

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490
helping to make the car I was the
 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.270
helping to make the car I was the
quality control inspector but the Honda

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280
quality control inspector but the Honda
 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.500
quality control inspector but the Honda
got to be and it was all working okay

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510
got to be and it was all working okay
 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.620
got to be and it was all working okay
and what they had done with the Honda is

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630
and what they had done with the Honda is
 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.379
and what they had done with the Honda is
that they looked at every aspect of the

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389
that they looked at every aspect of the
 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.939
that they looked at every aspect of the
car over time so if a windshield wiper

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949
car over time so if a windshield wiper
 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.890
car over time so if a windshield wiper
motor worked seventy thousand times and

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900
motor worked seventy thousand times and
 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.540
motor worked seventy thousand times and
they could make it work ninety thousand

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
they could make it work ninety thousand
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.520
they could make it work ninety thousand
by changing a little brush in if they

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530
by changing a little brush in if they
 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.560
by changing a little brush in if they
would put the brush in and they did this

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:53.570
would put the brush in and they did this
 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:55.839
would put the brush in and they did this
to every part of the car over a long

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849
to every part of the car over a long
 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.610
to every part of the car over a long
period of time in the Japanese cars

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620
period of time in the Japanese cars
 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.710
period of time in the Japanese cars
which in the 1970s were seen as of

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720
which in the 1970s were seen as of
 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.710
which in the 1970s were seen as of
inferior quality soon became the

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720
inferior quality soon became the
 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.909
inferior quality soon became the
standard because they applied this these

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919
standard because they applied this these
 

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.010
standard because they applied this these
processes to thinking about the

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020
processes to thinking about the
 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.399
processes to thinking about the
production line so if you think about it

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409
production line so if you think about it
 

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.240
production line so if you think about it
then you don't in the case of pollution

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.250
then you don't in the case of pollution
 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:17.370
then you don't in the case of pollution
you don't want to treat and

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:17.380
you don't want to treat and
 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.320
you don't want to treat and
decontaminate waste you want to drive it

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.330
decontaminate waste you want to drive it
 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:22.390
decontaminate waste you want to drive it
out of the production process because

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400
out of the production process because
 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.430
out of the production process because
that means you're using something in the

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440
that means you're using something in the
 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.529
that means you're using something in the
course of production that you're not

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539
course of production that you're not
 

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.020
course of production that you're not
selling isn't the idea when you make

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030
selling isn't the idea when you make
 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.149
selling isn't the idea when you make
something to sell it and make money off

00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.159
something to sell it and make money off
 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:33.040
something to sell it and make money off
of it so if I'm spewing into the

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050
of it so if I'm spewing into the
 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:34.750
of it so if I'm spewing into the
environment or trying to dump it into

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:34.760
environment or trying to dump it into
 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.969
environment or trying to dump it into
the river that means I'm not using it in

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:36.979
the river that means I'm not using it in
 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.190
the river that means I'm not using it in
production and so that's one of the

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:39.200
production and so that's one of the
 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.560
production and so that's one of the
core concepts of sustainability

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570
core concepts of sustainability
 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:43.120
core concepts of sustainability
management that you want to be

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:43.130
management that you want to be
 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:45.280
management that you want to be
parsimonious in your use of resources

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290
parsimonious in your use of resources
 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.650
parsimonious in your use of resources
not because you're you know Pete Seeger

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660
not because you're you know Pete Seeger
 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.080
not because you're you know Pete Seeger
or because you're thinking about the

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090
or because you're thinking about the
 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.900
or because you're thinking about the
environment but because you don't want

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:52.910
environment but because you don't want
 

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.520
environment but because you don't want
to pay for stuff you're not going to use

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:54.530
to pay for stuff you're not going to use
 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.280
to pay for stuff you're not going to use
and you want to sell everything that you

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:57.290
and you want to sell everything that you
 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:59.410
and you want to sell everything that you
that you buy and that you want to make

00:06:59.410 --> 00:06:59.420
that you buy and that you want to make
 

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.240
that you buy and that you want to make
sure your production processes work that

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250
sure your production processes work that
 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.030
sure your production processes work that
way so as this kind of thinking goes

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:04.040
way so as this kind of thinking goes
 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.920
way so as this kind of thinking goes
into organizations you start to

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930
into organizations you start to
 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.220
into organizations you start to
eliminate the growth environment

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:08.230
eliminate the growth environment
 

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:11.950
eliminate the growth environment
trade-off in fact the goal is to start

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960
trade-off in fact the goal is to start
 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.900
trade-off in fact the goal is to start
getting people to think about the

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:13.910
getting people to think about the
 

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:17.050
getting people to think about the
environment as the source of wealth that

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060
environment as the source of wealth that
 

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.560
environment as the source of wealth that
you actually want to use it as

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570
you actually want to use it as
 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.710
you actually want to use it as
efficiently as possible so what are the

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:23.720
efficiently as possible so what are the
 

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.810
efficiently as possible so what are the
technical challenges then of sustainable

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820
technical challenges then of sustainable
 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.520
technical challenges then of sustainable

system production this is what's the

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:34.940
system production this is what's the

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:48.340
out okay there's no if you if you're
producing something in there steam

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.350
producing something in there steam
 

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.710
producing something in there steam
that's produced in the process you

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720
that's produced in the process you
 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.650
that's produced in the process you
capture the steam and you use it to turn

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:53.660
capture the steam and you use it to turn
 

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.860
capture the steam and you use it to turn
a turbine and generate electricity

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:55.870
a turbine and generate electricity
 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.030
a turbine and generate electricity
instead of spewing it out into the

00:07:58.030 --> 00:07:58.040
instead of spewing it out into the
 

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.250
instead of spewing it out into the
environment if there's a chemical

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:00.260
environment if there's a chemical
 

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.280
environment if there's a chemical
effluent that comes out take a look at

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:03.290
effluent that comes out take a look at
 

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:05.530
effluent that comes out take a look at
what's in that chemical effluent and see

00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:05.540
what's in that chemical effluent and see
 

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:08.410
what's in that chemical effluent and see
can we separate this in the production

00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:08.420
can we separate this in the production
 

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.600
can we separate this in the production
process and sell it to somebody who

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:10.610
process and sell it to somebody who
 

00:08:10.610 --> 00:08:12.970
process and sell it to somebody who
needs that chemical instead of sending

00:08:12.970 --> 00:08:12.980
needs that chemical instead of sending
 

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.870
needs that chemical instead of sending
it into the Hudson River all resources

00:08:16.870 --> 00:08:16.880
it into the Hudson River all resources
 

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.390

so we send this computer out into the

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:27.590
so we send this computer out into the
 

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:28.830
so we send this computer out into the
marketplace

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840

remanufactured and they could be okay

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:21.880
remanufactured and they could be okay
 

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.780
remanufactured and they could be okay
that could be part you know imagine if

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:24.790
that could be part you know imagine if
 

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:28.320

HP right you put that you know basically

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:36.580
HP right you put that you know basically
 

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.240
HP right you put that you know basically
printers have become toner holders okay

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.250
printers have become toner holders okay
 

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.140
printers have become toner holders okay
the printer costs $80 the toner cost $80

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:42.150
the printer costs $80 the toner cost $80
 

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.430
the printer costs $80 the toner cost $80
this is not this is not an unusual

00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:44.440
this is not this is not an unusual
 

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.550
this is not this is not an unusual
commercial practice Shea a razor blades

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:47.560
commercial practice Shea a razor blades
 

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.470
commercial practice Shea a razor blades
were the first of these things the razor

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480
were the first of these things the razor
 

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.890

blade costs more than what holds it

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:52.900
blade costs more than what holds it
 

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.510
blade costs more than what holds it
because they're really in the business

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:54.520
because they're really in the business
 

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:56.250
because they're really in the business
of selling razor blades and so they

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:56.260
of selling razor blades and so they
 

00:09:56.260 --> 00:10:00.030
of selling razor blades and so they
basically give away the actual shaver

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040
basically give away the actual shaver
 

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:04.500
basically give away the actual shaver
okay the the point here is when the

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:04.510
okay the the point here is when the
 

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:07.230
okay the the point here is when the
products done can you take it back and

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:07.240
products done can you take it back and
 

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.870
products done can you take it back and
use it again and toner is very toxic and

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:09.880
use it again and toner is very toxic and
 

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.850
use it again and toner is very toxic and
they've even got a system now where the

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:11.860
they've even got a system now where the
 

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.830
they've even got a system now where the
box of the new one you put the old one

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:13.840
box of the new one you put the old one
 

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:17.280

something they take it back in most

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:21.010
something they take it back in most
 

00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:24.840
something they take it back in most
offices okay that's an example now why

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:24.850
offices okay that's an example now why
 

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:26.430
offices okay that's an example now why
does HP do this because they're nice

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:26.440
does HP do this because they're nice
 

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.230
does HP do this because they're nice
people and they care about the

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:28.240
people and they care about the
 

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.490
people and they care about the
environment I'm sure the nice people

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:29.500
environment I'm sure the nice people
 

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.020
environment I'm sure the nice people
they care about the environment but

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.030
they care about the environment but
 

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.580
they care about the environment but
they're doing it because they can take

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:32.590
they're doing it because they can take
 

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:35.550
they're doing it because they can take
that old packaging pour some more toner

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560
that old packaging pour some more toner
 

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.100
that old packaging pour some more toner
in and sell it again and sell it again

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:38.110
in and sell it again and sell it again
 

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:41.760
in and sell it again and sell it again
and sell it again and so in that respect

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:41.770
and sell it again and so in that respect
 

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:45.030
and sell it again and so in that respect
you can you you have a sustainable

00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:45.040
you can you you have a sustainable
 

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.329
you can you you have a sustainable
business now many many manufacturing

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:48.339
business now many many manufacturing
 

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:50.070
business now many many manufacturing
technologies ov and built on the

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:50.080
technologies ov and built on the
 

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.860
technologies ov and built on the
expectation that waste disposal was less

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:52.870
expectation that waste disposal was less
 

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.140
expectation that waste disposal was less
expensive than reuse and it still is the

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:55.150
expensive than reuse and it still is the
 

00:10:55.150 --> 00:10:58.260
expensive than reuse and it still is the
cost of collection and of bringing that

00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:58.270
cost of collection and of bringing that
 

00:10:58.270 --> 00:11:00.000
cost of collection and of bringing that
stuff back what a pain in the neck let's

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:00.010
stuff back what a pain in the neck let's
 

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:01.590
stuff back what a pain in the neck let's
just get rid of it we don't need this

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:01.600
just get rid of it we don't need this
 

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.390
just get rid of it we don't need this
stuff again right

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:03.400
stuff again right
 

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.160
stuff again right
so that's

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.170
so that's
 

00:11:05.170 --> 00:11:08.669
so that's
that's the the problem technically you

00:11:08.669 --> 00:11:08.679
that's the the problem technically you
 

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:10.439
that's the the problem technically you
have to create the technologies around

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:10.449
have to create the technologies around
 

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:13.949
have to create the technologies around
the product that make it clear that by

00:11:13.949 --> 00:11:13.959
the product that make it clear that by
 

00:11:13.959 --> 00:11:16.349
the product that make it clear that by
reusing it and remanufacturing and

00:11:16.349 --> 00:11:16.359
reusing it and remanufacturing and
 

00:11:16.359 --> 00:11:18.629
reusing it and remanufacturing and
recycling it the manufacturer will

00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639
recycling it the manufacturer will
 

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:21.389
recycling it the manufacturer will
actually save money and as natural

00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399
actually save money and as natural
 

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:23.879
actually save money and as natural
resources get more expensive and as some

00:11:23.879 --> 00:11:23.889
resources get more expensive and as some
 

00:11:23.889 --> 00:11:25.889
resources get more expensive and as some
of these elements become scarce or

00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:25.899
of these elements become scarce or
 

00:11:25.899 --> 00:11:28.619
of these elements become scarce or
you'll see more and more of this and you

00:11:28.619 --> 00:11:28.629
you'll see more and more of this and you
 

00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:30.059
you'll see more and more of this and you
know you already see it for example in

00:11:30.059 --> 00:11:30.069
know you already see it for example in
 

00:11:30.069 --> 00:11:33.150
know you already see it for example in
the tire business we now do in fact pay

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:33.160
the tire business we now do in fact pay
 

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.659
the tire business we now do in fact pay
to have our tires taken so what are the

00:11:36.659 --> 00:11:36.669
to have our tires taken so what are the
 

00:11:36.669 --> 00:11:38.819
to have our tires taken so what are the
other technical challenges the needs of

the average asia' of mortality for a

00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639
the average asia' of mortality for a
 

00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:53.850
the average asia' of mortality for a
firefighter is 62 years old and so the

00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:53.860
firefighter is 62 years old and so the
 

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.150
firefighter is 62 years old and so the
the average age of of mortality for the

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:57.160
the average age of of mortality for the
 

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.519
the average age of of mortality for the
rest of us is closer to 80 and so

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:18.810
you've seen that in New York City with
taxicabs I had a group at SEPA that

00:15:18.810 --> 00:15:18.820
taxicabs I had a group at SEPA that
 

00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.210
taxicabs I had a group at SEPA that
worked a few years ago on helping the

00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:21.220
worked a few years ago on helping the
 

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.370
worked a few years ago on helping the
City Council of New York writing the new

rules that encourage the use of hybrid
taxicabs okay taxi cabs get replaced

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:30.550
taxicabs okay taxi cabs get replaced
 

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:32.240
taxicabs okay taxi cabs get replaced
very frequently

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:32.250
very frequently
 

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:35.000
very frequently
because these guys drive them in three

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.010
because these guys drive them in three
 

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:38.060
because these guys drive them in three
shifts on New York City streets and they

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:38.070
shifts on New York City streets and they
 

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:41.000
shifts on New York City streets and they
get beaten up pretty badly and so the

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:41.010
get beaten up pretty badly and so the
 

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:43.280
get beaten up pretty badly and so the
replacement cycle is pretty quick and so

00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:43.290
replacement cycle is pretty quick and so
 

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.390
replacement cycle is pretty quick and so
that's a place where you can do

00:15:44.390 --> 00:15:44.400
that's a place where you can do
 

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.830
that's a place where you can do
something in a hurry on that on the

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:45.840
something in a hurry on that on the
 

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.070
something in a hurry on that on the
other hand sanitation trucks and other

other hand sanitation trucks and other
kinds of heavy material like that can

kinds of heavy material like that can
 

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:53.900
kinds of heavy material like that can
take a long time before they're ready

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:53.910
take a long time before they're ready
 

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:56.990
take a long time before they're ready
for replacement and so you have to be

00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000
for replacement and so you have to be
 

00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.690
for replacement and so you have to be
able to encourage that now one of the

00:15:59.690 --> 00:15:59.700
able to encourage that now one of the
 

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.610
able to encourage that now one of the
things government could do is you could

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:01.620
things government could do is you could
 

00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.890
things government could do is you could
make the depreciation rules and other

00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:03.900
make the depreciation rules and other
 

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.070
make the depreciation rules and other
tax incentives in place to allow that

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:07.080
tax incentives in place to allow that
 

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.310

technologies that's the way you could

00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:11.250
technologies that's the way you could
 

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:13.000
technologies that's the way you could
accelerate some of these kinds of things

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:13.010
accelerate some of these kinds of things
 

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:17.150
accelerate some of these kinds of things
the other thing is newness sells people

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160
the other thing is newness sells people
 

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.070
the other thing is newness sells people

the rate of return of invested capital

00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:40.770
the rate of return of invested capital

the rate of return of invested capital
is higher for non sustainable

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:43.290
is higher for non sustainable
 

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:45.080
is higher for non sustainable
investments than for sustainable

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.090

or perceived as higher doesn't even have
 

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.930
or perceived as higher doesn't even have
to be higher the capital won't go to the

to be higher the capital won't go to the
 

00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:56.240
to be higher the capital won't go to the
to the renewable resource or to the

to the renewable resource or to the

to the renewable resource or to the
sustainability investment and

00:17:58.190 --> 00:17:58.200
sustainability investment and
 

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.230
sustainability investment and
particularly in a time when capital

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:00.240
particularly in a time when capital
 

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.060
particularly in a time when capital
scarce and we're just coming out of that

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:02.070
scarce and we're just coming out of that
 

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:04.340
scarce and we're just coming out of that
period right now and the American

00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:04.350
period right now and the American
 

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:07.190
period right now and the American
economy and the world economy then these

00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200
economy and the world economy then these

economy and the world economy then these
investments may not be attractive enough

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:09.270
investments may not be attractive enough
 

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:13.039
investments may not be attractive enough
to compete for scarce resources so that

00:18:13.039 --> 00:18:13.049
to compete for scarce resources so that
 

00:18:13.049 --> 00:18:15.529
to compete for scarce resources so that
it might act it might be profitable but

00:18:15.529 --> 00:18:15.539
it might act it might be profitable but
 

00:18:15.539 --> 00:18:18.230
it might act it might be profitable but
not profitable enough and that's the

00:18:18.230 --> 00:18:18.240
not profitable enough and that's the
 

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:19.850
not profitable enough and that's the
kind of thing that you have to ask

00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:19.860
kind of thing that you have to ask
 

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.529
kind of thing that you have to ask
yourself and they have to look at and

00:18:21.529 --> 00:18:21.539
yourself and they have to look at and
 

00:18:21.539 --> 00:18:23.510
yourself and they have to look at and
again government can play a role in this

00:18:23.510 --> 00:18:23.520
again government can play a role in this
 

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:25.279
again government can play a role in this
so if you think about something like

00:18:25.279 --> 00:18:25.289
so if you think about something like
 

00:18:25.289 --> 00:18:29.330
so if you think about something like
municipal bonds municipal bonds have a

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:29.340
municipal bonds municipal bonds have a
 

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:33.470
municipal bonds municipal bonds have a
very healthy market because the federal

00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:33.480
very healthy market because the federal
 

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.000
very healthy market because the federal
government and the state governments and

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:35.010
government and the state governments and
 

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:37.190
government and the state governments and
local governments don't tax the interest

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:37.200
local governments don't tax the interest
 

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.430
local governments don't tax the interest
on that and so when if I invest in those

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440
on that and so when if I invest in those
 

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.799
on that and so when if I invest in those
kinds of bonds and I make you know ten

00:18:42.799 --> 00:18:42.809
kinds of bonds and I make you know ten
 

00:18:42.809 --> 00:18:44.600
kinds of bonds and I make you know ten
thousand dollars a profit I don't have

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:44.610
thousand dollars a profit I don't have
 

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:47.090
thousand dollars a profit I don't have
to pay any tax on that ten thousand

00:18:47.090 --> 00:18:47.100
to pay any tax on that ten thousand
 

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:48.889
to pay any tax on that ten thousand
dollars that means that the government

00:18:48.889 --> 00:18:48.899
dollars that means that the government
 

00:18:48.899 --> 00:18:50.779
dollars that means that the government
can charge a lower rate when they go to

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:50.789
can charge a lower rate when they go to
 

00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:52.789
can charge a lower rate when they go to
the bond market which makes it a more

00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799
the bond market which makes it a more
 

00:18:52.799 --> 00:18:54.560
the bond market which makes it a more
attractive investment for everybody

00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:54.570
attractive investment for everybody
 

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:59.450
attractive investment for everybody
that kind of tax expenditure by the

00:18:59.450 --> 00:18:59.460
that kind of tax expenditure by the
 

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.330
that kind of tax expenditure by the
government can can move along socially

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.340
government can can move along socially
 

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:03.919
government can can move along socially
responsible investments and that's

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:03.929
responsible investments and that's
 

00:19:03.929 --> 00:19:06.590
responsible investments and that's
something that needs to be used here the

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600
something that needs to be used here the
 

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.110
something that needs to be used here the
other issue is uncertain return because

00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120
other issue is uncertain return because
 

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.180
other issue is uncertain return because

fundamental basis for resources that
 

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.590
fundamental basis for resources that
will come back ok and so if we need to

00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:22.600
will come back ok and so if we need to
 

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.200
will come back ok and so if we need to
think about that as the basis for our

00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:25.210
think about that as the basis for our
 

00:30:25.210 --> 00:30:27.960
