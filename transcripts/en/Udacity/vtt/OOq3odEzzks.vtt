00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.270
All data store queries are performed using indexes,

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.520
and knowing how they work is important when you

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.340
design and build your applications. If you have

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.550
worked with a relational database management system, and SQL.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.870
You should be aware that those indexes are

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.330
not the same as data store indexes. Indexes in

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.740
RDBMS are a query optimization used to retrieve your

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.740
result faster. While indexes in Datastore are, in fact,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.580
required to perform a query on that data at all. So you if you want to query for

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.080
Datastore data, there has to be an index for

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.740
that data. Be sure to remember this. So let's

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.870
look at Datastore indexes by going back to conferences.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.680
And look at what happens when we perform a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.440
search on the property city. In fact, let's even

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.950
talk about what happens before the query. When storing entities,

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.810
Datastore also updates index tables, which are

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.140
later used to find entities when the query

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.280
is made. These index tables consist of an

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.790
index value, that maps to a matching entity

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.450
key. Taking the city Berlin as an example,

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.033
the index value would be constructed using the

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.801
kind, conference. Then the property, city, and finally

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:15.030
the value of the property, Berlin. Here are

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.680
the index values for the cities Halloween,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.590
London, and Paris. So again, the index value

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.600
is a combination of the kind, property, and

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.030
value of the property. Each index value then

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.010
points to the entity key where the value

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.150
resides. So a matching entity where city is

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.570
Berlin has the following key. And one with

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.920
London has the following key, and so on.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.880
So let's say your favorite city is, Paris.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.040
And you would like to get all conferences that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.030
are in Paris. Then Datastore would look at the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.160
index table where city is Paris, and find all

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.140
matching entities. Since data store require index tables

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.350
to perform queries, every property that you query for

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.624
will need an index table. By default, Datastore creates

00:02:03.624 --> 00:02:06.310
these automatically. But we will also see how you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.510
can control this later on.
