00:00:12.532 --> 00:00:16.054
I want to talk about
one of the big questions,

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:18.612
perhaps the biggest question:

00:00:18.636 --> 00:00:20.476
How should we live together?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.951
How should a group of people,
who perhaps live in a city

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:26.134
or in the continent

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:27.442
or even the whole globe,

00:00:27.466 --> 00:00:30.236
share and manage common resources?

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.212
How should we make
the rules that govern us?

00:00:33.236 --> 00:00:35.537
This has always been
an important question.

00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:38.347
And today, I think
it's even more important than ever

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:43.481
if we want to address rising inequality,
climate change, the refugee crisis,

00:00:43.505 --> 00:00:46.085
just to name a few major issues.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.815
It's also a very old question.

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:51.237
Humans have been asking
themselves this question

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:54.196
ever since we lived
in organized societies.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.358
Like this guy, Plato.

00:00:56.786 --> 00:00:58.911
He thought we needed benevolent guardians

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:02.671
who could make decisions
for the greater good of everyone.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.274
Kings and queens thought
they could be those guardians,

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:09.918
but during various revolutions,
they tended to lose their heads.

00:01:10.473 --> 00:01:12.871
And this guy, you probably know.

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:14.966
Here in Hungary, you lived for many years

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.067
under one attempt to implement
his answer of how to live together.

00:01:19.886 --> 00:01:22.965
His answer was brutal, cruel and inhumane.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:26.498
But a different answer,
a different kind of answer,

00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:30.387
which went more or less
into hibernation for 2,000 years,

00:01:30.411 --> 00:01:33.528
has had profound recent success.

00:01:33.552 --> 00:01:36.036
That answer is, of course, democracy.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:40.164
If we take a quick look
at the modern history of democracy,

00:01:40.188 --> 00:01:41.823
it goes something like this.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:45.140
Along here, we're going
to put the last 200 years.

00:01:45.164 --> 00:01:48.180
Up here, we're going to put
the number of democracies.

00:01:48.204 --> 00:01:50.132
And the graph does this,

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.395
the important point of which,

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.672
is this extraordinary increase over time,

00:01:55.696 --> 00:01:57.474
which is why the 20th century

00:01:57.498 --> 00:02:00.641
has been called the century
of democracy's triumph,

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:04.093
and why, as Francis Fukuyama said in 1989,

00:02:04.117 --> 00:02:07.122
some believe that we have reached
the end of history,

00:02:07.146 --> 00:02:10.808
that the question of how to live together
has been answered,

00:02:10.832 --> 00:02:13.312
and that answer is liberal democracy.

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:15.776
Let's explore that assertion, though.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.656
I want to find out what you think.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.569
So I'm going to ask you two questions,

00:02:19.593 --> 00:02:21.338
and I want you to put your hands up

00:02:21.362 --> 00:02:22.513
if you agree.

00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:26.815
The first question is: Who thinks
living in a democracy is a good thing?

00:02:27.246 --> 00:02:28.708
Who likes democracy?

00:02:28.732 --> 00:02:31.732
If you can think of a better system,
keep your hands down.

00:02:31.756 --> 00:02:34.248
Don't worry about those
who didn't raise their hands,

00:02:34.272 --> 00:02:35.672
I'm sure they mean very well.

00:02:35.696 --> 00:02:37.205
The second question is:

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.509
Who thinks our democracies
are functioning well?

00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:44.953
Come on, there must be one politician
in the audience somewhere.

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:46.077
(Laughter)

00:02:46.101 --> 00:02:47.251
No.

00:02:47.275 --> 00:02:51.979
But my point is, if liberal democracy
is the end of history,

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:55.614
then there's a massive paradox
or contradiction here.

00:02:55.967 --> 00:02:57.119
Why is that?

00:02:57.143 --> 00:03:00.994
Well, the first question
is about the ideal of democracy,

00:03:01.018 --> 00:03:03.868
and all these qualities
are very appealing.

00:03:04.345 --> 00:03:06.361
But in practice, it's not working.

00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:08.115
And that's the second question.

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.323
Our politics is broken,
our politicians aren't trusted,

00:03:12.347 --> 00:03:16.487
and the political system is distorted
by powerful vested interests.

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.259
I think there's two ways
to resolve this paradox.

00:03:20.656 --> 00:03:23.935
One is to give up on democracy;
it doesn't work.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.656
Let's elect a populist demagogue
who will ignore democratic norms,

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.182
trample on liberal freedoms

00:03:29.206 --> 00:03:30.839
and just get things done.

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:34.760
The other option, I think,
is to fix this broken system,

00:03:34.784 --> 00:03:37.641
to bring the practice closer to the ideal

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:41.149
and put the diverse voices of society
in our parliaments

00:03:41.173 --> 00:03:44.157
and get them to make considered,
evidence-based laws

00:03:44.181 --> 00:03:46.221
for the long-term good of everyone.

00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:48.538
Which brings me to my epiphany,

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:50.197
my moment of enlightenment.

00:03:50.221 --> 00:03:51.753
And I want you to get critical.

00:03:51.777 --> 00:03:54.576
I want you to ask yourselves,
"Why wouldn't this work?"

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.933
And then come and talk to me
afterwards about it.

00:03:57.363 --> 00:03:59.746
Its technical name is "sortition."

00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:02.648
But its common name is "random selection."

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.973
And the idea is actually very simple:

00:04:06.537 --> 00:04:09.743
we randomly select people
and put them in parliament.

00:04:10.148 --> 00:04:11.299
(Laughter)

00:04:11.323 --> 00:04:14.006
Let's think about that
for a few more minutes, shall we?

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:18.474
Imagine we chose you and you
and you and you and you down there

00:04:18.498 --> 00:04:20.529
and a bunch of other random people,

00:04:20.553 --> 00:04:23.695
and we put you in our parliament
for the next couple of years.

00:04:23.719 --> 00:04:27.988
Of course, we could stratify the selection
to make sure that it matched

00:04:28.012 --> 00:04:31.592
the socioeconomic and demographic
profile of the country

00:04:31.616 --> 00:04:34.998
and was a truly representative
sample of people.

00:04:35.022 --> 00:04:37.600
Fifty percent of them would be women.

00:04:37.624 --> 00:04:40.434
Many of them would be young,
some would be old,

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:41.783
a few would be rich,

00:04:41.807 --> 00:04:45.789
but most of them would be
ordinary people like you and me.

00:04:46.396 --> 00:04:50.095
This would be a microcosm of society.

00:04:50.119 --> 00:04:54.331
And this microcosm would simulate
how we would all think,

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:57.399
if we had the time, the information

00:04:57.423 --> 00:05:02.000
and a good process to come to
the moral crux of political decisions.

00:05:02.024 --> 00:05:04.087
And although you may not be in that group,

00:05:04.111 --> 00:05:06.262
someone of your age,
someone of your gender,

00:05:06.286 --> 00:05:09.159
someone from your location
and someone with your background

00:05:09.183 --> 00:05:10.649
would be in that room.

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:15.863
The decisions made by these people
would build on the wisdom of crowds.

00:05:15.887 --> 00:05:18.283
They would become more
than the sum of their parts.

00:05:18.307 --> 00:05:20.331
They would become critical thinkers

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:22.175
with access to experts,

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.331
who would be on tap but not on top.

00:05:25.355 --> 00:05:28.863
And they could prove
that diversity can trump ability

00:05:28.887 --> 00:05:33.747
when confronting the wide array
of societal questions and problems.

00:05:34.466 --> 00:05:38.321
It would not be government
by public opinion poll.

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:42.045
It would not be government by referendum.

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:47.276
These informed, deliberating people
would move beyond public opinion

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.914
to the making of public judgments.

00:05:50.866 --> 00:05:54.087
However, there would be
one major side effect:

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:57.556
if we replaced elections with sortition

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:01.268
and made our parliament
truly representative of society,

00:06:01.292 --> 00:06:04.141
it would mean the end of politicians.

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:06.664
And I'm sure we'd all be
pretty sad to see that.

00:06:06.688 --> 00:06:08.786
(Laughter)

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.522
Very interestingly,

00:06:10.546 --> 00:06:14.235
random selection was a key part
of how democracy was done

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.125
in ancient Athens.

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:19.522
This machine, this device,
is called a kleroteria.

00:06:19.546 --> 00:06:23.029
It's an ancient Athenian
random-selection device.

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:26.276
The ancient Athenians
randomly selected citizens

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.400
to fill the vast majority
of their political posts.

00:06:30.828 --> 00:06:34.903
They knew that elections
were aristocratic devices.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:39.133
They knew that career politicians
were a thing to be avoided.

00:06:39.157 --> 00:06:41.664
And I think we know these things as well.

00:06:41.688 --> 00:06:45.481
But more interesting than
the ancient use of random selection

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:47.677
is its modern resurgence.

00:06:47.701 --> 00:06:52.431
The rediscovery of the legitimacy
of random selection in politics

00:06:52.455 --> 00:06:54.319
has become so common lately,

00:06:54.343 --> 00:06:57.029
that there's simply
too many examples to talk about.

00:06:57.053 --> 00:06:59.839
Of course, I'm very aware
that it's going to be difficult

00:06:59.863 --> 00:07:02.490
to institute this in our parliaments.

00:07:02.514 --> 00:07:04.228
Try this -- say to your friend,

00:07:04.252 --> 00:07:08.061
"I think we should populate our parliament
with randomly selected people."

00:07:08.085 --> 00:07:09.250
"Are you joking?

00:07:09.274 --> 00:07:10.808
What if my neighbor gets chosen?

00:07:10.832 --> 00:07:13.307
The fool can't even
separate his recycling."

00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:18.077
But the perhaps surprising
but overwhelming and compelling evidence

00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:20.022
from all these modern examples

00:07:20.046 --> 00:07:21.990
is that it does work.

00:07:22.014 --> 00:07:26.138
If you give people responsibility,
they act responsibly.

00:07:26.678 --> 00:07:28.934
Don't get me wrong -- it's not a panacea.

00:07:28.958 --> 00:07:31.966
The question is not:
Would this be perfect?

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.141
Of course not.

00:07:33.165 --> 00:07:34.530
People are fallibly human,

00:07:34.554 --> 00:07:37.494
and distorting influences
will continue to exist.

00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.576
The question is: Would it be better?

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:45.228
And the answer to that question,
to me at least, is obviously yes.

00:07:45.252 --> 00:07:48.467
Which gets us back
to our original question:

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.951
How should we live together?

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:52.729
And now we have an answer:

00:07:52.753 --> 00:07:56.114
with a parliament that uses sortition.

00:07:56.745 --> 00:07:59.593
But how would we get from here to there?

00:07:59.617 --> 00:08:01.958
How could we fix our broken system

00:08:01.982 --> 00:08:05.257
and remake democracy for the 21st century?

00:08:05.784 --> 00:08:09.006
Well, there are several
things that we can do,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:12.101
and that are, in fact,
happening right now.

00:08:12.125 --> 00:08:13.967
We can experiment with sortition.

00:08:13.991 --> 00:08:18.220
We can introduce it to schools
and workplaces and other institutions,

00:08:18.244 --> 00:08:21.331
like Democracy In Practice
is doing in Bolivia.

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:24.553
We can hold policy juries
and citizens' assemblies,

00:08:24.577 --> 00:08:27.611
like the newDemocracy Foundation
is doing in Australia,

00:08:27.635 --> 00:08:30.047
like the Jefferson Center
is doing in the US

00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:33.051
and like the Irish government
is doing right now.

00:08:33.508 --> 00:08:36.404
We could build a social movement
demanding change,

00:08:36.428 --> 00:08:39.635
which is what the Sortition Foundation
is doing in the UK.

00:08:40.062 --> 00:08:42.482
And at some point, we should institute it.

00:08:42.506 --> 00:08:46.784
Perhaps the first step would be
a second chamber in our parliament,

00:08:46.808 --> 00:08:48.982
full of randomly selected people --

00:08:49.006 --> 00:08:51.300
a citizens' senate, if you will.

00:08:51.324 --> 00:08:54.433
There's a campaign
for a citizens' senate in France

00:08:54.457 --> 00:08:56.704
and another campaign in Scotland,

00:08:56.728 --> 00:08:59.807
and it could, of course, be done
right here in Hungary.

00:08:59.831 --> 00:09:04.771
That would be kind of like a Trojan horse
right into the heart of government.

00:09:05.136 --> 00:09:07.117
And then, when it becomes impossible

00:09:07.141 --> 00:09:09.696
to patch over the cracks
in the current system,

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.943
we must step up and replace
elections with sortition.

00:09:13.332 --> 00:09:14.586
I have hope.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.942
Here in Hungary,
systems have been created,

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:19.053
and systems have been
torn down and replaced

00:09:19.077 --> 00:09:20.286
in the past.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.126
Change can and does happen.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.762
It's just a matter of when and how.

00:09:25.786 --> 00:09:27.389
Thank you.
(Hungarian) Thank you.

00:09:27.413 --> 00:09:30.017
(Applause)
