00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.660
COLIN QUINN: Thanks, David.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.480
Thank you.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.480
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Thank
you so much for coming.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.290
COLIN QUINN: Sure.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.850
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So what do
we do about this free speech

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.870
thing?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.325
COLIN QUINN: Well,
it's too late.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.220
It's too late to stop it now.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.880
People want to
speak, unfortunately.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.400
Yeah, I mean, look,
it's like anything else.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.530
Everything starts
out as a great idea,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.144
and then just dwindles
down to destroyed by us.

00:00:31.144 --> 00:00:32.060
DAVID WINDMUELLER: OK.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.770
Well, congratulations
on your show.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.670
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.836
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Great
reviews all the way around.

00:00:36.836 --> 00:00:38.370
It's been extended
through March.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.807
And it even had great reviews
in both "The New York Times"

00:00:41.807 --> 00:00:42.890
and "The National Review."

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.000
COLIN QUINN: Yes, I know.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.500
I was--

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.940
DAVID WINDMUELLER: I mean,
mission accomplished.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.110
What did you-- were you
surprised by this feedback?

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.860
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.380
I mean, I've gotten a
lot of weird reviews

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.270
anyway in my career.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:00.530
So it's like at a
certain point, you just

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.690
become numb to any abuse of it.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.537
So I was surprised,
and happily surprised,

00:01:04.537 --> 00:01:05.870
that I was getting good reviews.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:10.936
But I mean, yeah, obviously,
I mean, getting reviews,

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:11.560
it's supposed--

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.851
I mean, that's how I am anyway.

00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:14.099
I'm not really left or right.

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:15.140
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.380
And every single one of the
reviewers got something out.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.719
It was like a "Rashomon" thing.

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:20.510
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.860
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Where
they were each hearing,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.450
yeah, Colin's telling
it like it is.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.440
And each side heard
their own thing.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.050
COLIN QUINN: That's
the weird thing.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:27.831
It's like after the
show, the whole show's

00:01:27.831 --> 00:01:30.080
about how everybody is just--
this is just ridiculous,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.410
and how we're all not that
bright yet as far as human

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.070
nature.

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.670
And then people come up to
me at the show going, yeah,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.950
they start yelling
about the same things

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.010
that I'm complaining about.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.540
My show is me
complaining that people

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.870
have the right to complain
on social media, basically.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.329
I mean, if you really look
at it past the opening level,

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.370
it's just me being a
hypocrite and saying, nobody

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.703
should be allowed to say all
these things except for me.

00:01:54.703 --> 00:01:56.574
But I'm trying to hide it.

00:01:56.574 --> 00:01:59.240
But they're just-- but it's like
everything just goes right back

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.900
into--

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.170
everybody is in this-- it's
so locked in right now.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.170
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.593
COLIN QUINN: It's like mass
brainwashing, mass hysteria.

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:09.259
DAVID WINDMUELLER: You did a lot
of research for both this show,

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.260
for your constitutional show.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.030
Did you find anything
surprising like in the founding

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.920
of the country or the
discourse in that process?

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.150
COLIN QUINN: Yeah, just that it
never really took off the way--

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.099
it was never--

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:22.640
it's just been a
fight the whole way.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.290
Like in the constitution
show, I would

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.770
say it was fine when nobody knew
what anybody else was doing.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.150
But since social
media, everybody

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.419
knows exactly how
everybody else is.

00:02:31.419 --> 00:02:33.710
So you can't just be like,
ah, I never see them anyway.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.120
You see everybody, each
other's face all day.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.703
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
That's interesting,

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:41.360
because are we like now breeding
these internet savvy personas

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.150
to excel, as opposed
to like the policy

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.020
wonks that we've created
like in high school elections

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.180
that we hated them before.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.160
Is this what we
are creating now?

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.910
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.480
I wonder, because like I'll just
take comedians, for example.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.886
A lot of comedians suddenly
became very serious people.

00:03:00.886 --> 00:03:02.510
And so I always say
everybody is trying

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.620
to be funny on social
media except comedians.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.090
But it's like suddenly
people-- this other side.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.395
It's almost like a--

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:13.090
remember Beyonce had like
that side personality.

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.530
I forget the name.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.015
And if I knew the name, you
all would be creeped out.

00:03:17.015 --> 00:03:18.230
AUDIENCE: Sasha Fierce.

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.860
COLIN QUINN: Sasha Fierce.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.530
Thank you.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.302
And I shouldn't
have even been that

00:03:21.302 --> 00:03:23.510
quick to know what you were
talking about, but I did.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.770
But I'm just saying I feel like
online people do have this side

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.070
personality now, where
people I know-- and I'm like,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.350
just online they're a
different person than they

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.220
are in real life.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.450
That's the other weird thing.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:36.860
DAVID WINDMUELLER: You had
a side personality before.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.450
COLIN QUINN: Oh, online.

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.900
Yeah.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.200
DAVID WINDMUELLER: No,
no, no, not online.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.616
In your book you
talk about Colim.

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.860
COLIN QUINN: That's quite a
jump, but all right, yeah.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.390
Back when I used to
drink in my early 20's.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.650
But I used to pretend to be--

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.230
I was trying to pick
up girls, and I would

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.439
pretend I had an Irish accent.

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.730
I mean, I would just put on
this Northern Irish accent.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.230
It's not as lame as it sounds.

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.470
It was a specific Belfast--

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.340
it wasn't like a
Lucky Charms guy.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.440
This was like a serious--

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.800
I was doing serious
character work.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.570
And I would just sit
at the bar by myself,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.630
because nobody wanted to
hang out with me anyway,

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.837
because I was like the
real typical idiot drunk.

00:04:15.837 --> 00:04:18.170
And I'd just be like, (IRISH
ACCENT) hey, how you doing?

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.250
And I'd been talking to
like all these people.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.920
And I'd say my name was Colim.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.620
And I would hint around
that I was from Belfast,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.430
and I had to leave under murky
circumstances because of an IRA

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.010
thing.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.460
It ended with-- a lot of times,
it ended in a lot of violence,

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.140
where I caught a
lot of beatings.

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.510
I'll be honest.

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:42.470
But that was my plan.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.060
And it seemed like--

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.000
it worked for a while.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.482
It would work for
like a half hour.

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:50.690
And then something would
happen where I'd be exposed.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.060
Or the girl would just
be like, you just said--

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.630
now you said you're from
Brooklyn, or something.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.713
I'd be like, ah, you know?

00:04:55.713 --> 00:04:57.500
And it was just
never really panned

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.957
out the way I had it
planned in my head.

00:04:59.957 --> 00:05:01.040
Look, I'm not proud of it.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.890
I'm just saying it was an idea.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.330
You're in your early 20's.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.980
You want to meet women or men.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.142
And you have ideas.

00:05:08.142 --> 00:05:08.850
That was my idea.

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.369
I committed to it.

00:05:11.369 --> 00:05:12.410
And I would just lock in.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.780
It's the mind like
after a couple of beers.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.520
I was like, I'm Colim now.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.270
And I'd walk in.

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.480
I had like a green corduroy
jacket with patches

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.780
and like an Irish sweater.

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.194
If you saw me at that time--

00:05:24.194 --> 00:05:26.360
I know now it looks like
it wouldn't-- at that time,

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:27.526
it could have worked on you.

00:05:27.526 --> 00:05:29.570
You'd be surprised.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:30.466
Smoking, you know?

00:05:30.466 --> 00:05:31.215
The bar, tortured.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.062
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So
getting back to your show.

00:05:37.062 --> 00:05:37.770
COLIN QUINN: Yes.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.436
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:05:39.436 --> 00:05:40.810
COLIN QUINN: But
I forgot to say,

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:42.268
I had read this
one big book called

00:05:42.268 --> 00:05:44.367
"Trinity" about the Irish.

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:45.200
So I stole the name.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.440
I stole every aspect of
the guy's personality,

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.880
except that was
set in the 1800s,

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.420
and mine was in the 1970s.

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.860
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.720
COLIN QUINN: So everything else
was just right from that book.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.950
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Leon Uris.

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.190
COLIN QUINN: So anybody
who read the book--

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:56.240
yeah, Leon Uris.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.530
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:57.440
COLIN QUINN: And it
was a popular book,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.856
so I probably got called out
a few times on that one, too.

00:05:59.856 --> 00:06:01.840
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
Oh, you're a reader.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.030
COLIN QUINN: I love to read.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.631
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And so
like Joyce, another Irish.

00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:06.380
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.380
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Anything
else that has really

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.500
impressed you greatly.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:10.200
COLIN QUINN: I mean, not lately.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.134
But I mean, my favorite
book of all time

00:06:12.134 --> 00:06:13.550
is called "Confederacy
of Dunces,"

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.956
which is like to me the
funniest book ever written.

00:06:15.956 --> 00:06:17.330
And I still read
it all the time.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:19.350
And I'm obsessed with
it my whole life.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.822
But I mean, yeah,
I love to read.

00:06:20.822 --> 00:06:23.030
DAVID WINDMUELLER: You said
it was a test for dating.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.810
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:24.740
I actually used it.

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.362
I used to buy it for whatever
girlfriend I was dating.

00:06:27.362 --> 00:06:28.820
I'm not coming
across good in this.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.688
I get it.

00:06:30.688 --> 00:06:33.410
You're like, this
guy's a monster.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.180
Fraudulent accents.

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.670
Testing people with books.

00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.170
Hey, I never said
I was a great guy.

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.030
I'm a comedian.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.080
Nice is not funny.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.490
And yeah, so I would give
the book to whatever girl

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:47.130
I was dating.

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.860
And I'd say, hey,
it's a great book.

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.642
And if she liked it, then
I felt like we connected.

00:06:51.642 --> 00:06:53.600
And if she didn't like
it, I was like, ah, man,

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.411
this is going to-- but girls
gave me books to test, too.

00:06:57.411 --> 00:06:58.910
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
Any you remember?

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.370
COLIN QUINN: "Frankenstein,"
which I'd never read before,

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:03.328
and I was like, wow, it
was really-- it's deep.

00:07:03.328 --> 00:07:04.730
It's so much deeper.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.032
And speaking of today, there's
something about "Frankenstein."

00:07:08.032 --> 00:07:09.990
I've been thinking about
"Frankenstein" lately,

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:12.380
which is like the
thing on social media

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.240
is people we do love--

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.780
I love it, too-- to go after
somebody that you don't like,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.110
like the instinct of vigilante.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.110
Just get them.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.610
Get them.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.070
It's such a human nature thing.

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:26.270
It's just crazy.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:27.425
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And we've
made it a lot more efficient

00:07:27.425 --> 00:07:27.680
now.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:28.850
COLIN QUINN: And we've made
it a lot more efficient.

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:29.060
Yeah.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:29.750
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
It's very efficient.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.150
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:30.690
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.720
COLIN QUINN: Because
Frankenstein was a good guy.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.740
When you read the
book, you're like, oh,

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:34.934
Frankenstein was a good--

00:07:34.934 --> 00:07:37.350
the monster was a good guy,
and the doctor was a good guy.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.370
It just was he had
like a bad spin.

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.180
They just caught--
you know what I mean?

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:42.910
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Bad PR.

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:44.201
COLIN QUINN: It's almost, yeah.

00:07:44.201 --> 00:07:46.902
It almost was like an early
social media commentary.

00:07:46.902 --> 00:07:47.860
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Mmm.

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.680
Next project.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.150
COLIN QUINN: Yes.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:55.700
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So
like speaking of social,

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:57.777
Hobbs talked about
social contract.

00:07:57.777 --> 00:08:00.110
So we're now in this new phase
of social media contract.

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.550
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.220
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
What does that look up?

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:04.220
What are we giving away and
what do we get in return now?

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.910
COLIN QUINN: Well, I mean, like
I say, it is, in some ways,

00:08:07.910 --> 00:08:10.400
you expose so much stuff.

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.650
But at the same time,
nothing can really

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.265
get done, because everybody's
got a little bit of something.

00:08:17.265 --> 00:08:19.640
How many times do you have
people pointing something out?

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.350
And then people, go, let's go
over your tweets in the past.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:22.630
Everybody's like, whoa.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.310
It's just everybody's
a little bit guilty.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.850
So in a way, I guess, I'm not
sure where it goes from here.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.647
But like nobody's pure.

00:08:32.647 --> 00:08:34.730
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Have
you changed your behavior,

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:35.510
like your social?

00:08:35.510 --> 00:08:37.700
Like you started doing something
right when the internet came

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:39.116
out, and then all
of a sudden, you

00:08:39.116 --> 00:08:41.026
go, oh, that's a big mistake.

00:08:41.026 --> 00:08:42.400
I'm never going
to do that again.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.970
COLIN QUINN: Well, no.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:45.553
But my whole social media thing
was ironic from the beginning.

00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:47.500
So it's kind of like this.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.020
I'm just literally like a troll.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.010
Even when I'm trying
to be on social media,

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.440
I'm always like even, you know?

00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.450
I'm just like talking
about the weather.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.680
Just my whole thing is
like about-- it's just

00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.575
kind of ironically.

00:08:59.575 --> 00:09:00.825
It was funny at the beginning.

00:09:00.825 --> 00:09:02.200
I was telling you backstage.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.120
When I first started Twitter
in like 2009 or whatever,

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.500
and I was like, Will Ferrell--

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:07.916
he had won this
Mark Twain Award--

00:09:07.916 --> 00:09:10.850
and I was like, well, people
see him as a nice guy,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.660
but when I worked at "SNL,"
it was quite the opposite.

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.739
He stole "Anchorman."

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:16.530
That was my script.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.720
It was on my desk.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.690
And then I came by later,
and he was putting it

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:21.120
in a copy machine.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.090
And then I said, but
I don't blame him.

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.060
Heroin does that to people.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.930
But then it became like a
real thing, where suddenly

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.880
"Huff Post" and
everybody was saying,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.101
Colin Quinn says Will Ferrell
is a heroin addict, and a heroin

00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:37.600
dealer.

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.770
I called him a dealer.

00:09:38.770 --> 00:09:40.061
And then people are calling me.

00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:42.760
And finally, it became like
I had to make a retraction.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:46.820
But I've always been like just
obviously joking on Twitter.

00:09:46.820 --> 00:09:49.854
I've never said a sincere
thing on Twitter in my life.

00:09:49.854 --> 00:09:51.520
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
That leaves me like--

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.840
in your show, you
talk about that we're

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:53.800
breaking up the country.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.090
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.036
DAVID WINDMUELLER: It
needs to be, or it will be.

00:09:55.036 --> 00:09:55.930
It doesn't matter.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:09:56.740
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:59.230
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So a
tweet like yours maybe

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.730
will be the Fort Sumter tweet,
that you may start something

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:05.862
that gets in the press.

00:10:05.862 --> 00:10:07.570
COLIN QUINN: You mean
joking, and then it

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:08.430
becomes a real thing?

00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.430
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
Right, right, right.

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.480
Like the mouse that roared.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.260
COLIN QUINN: You're
right, though.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:11.968
But you're right.

00:10:11.968 --> 00:10:14.800
A tweet probably will
start our next war.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:15.885
It will be a tweet, right?

00:10:15.885 --> 00:10:17.590
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yes.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:22.180
So I don't know if you
anticipate something like that.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.200
COLIN QUINN: Oh, my god.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.110
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So like
one thing that is on my mind

00:10:26.110 --> 00:10:30.400
a lot is that it's relentless,
like the churn that we get

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.740
so much information, so much.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:36.100
I remember a time where I could
go two weeks without knowing

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:37.990
what the president was doing.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:39.220
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.290
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
So do you disconnect?

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.270
I know it's part of
your work, but do you

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.430
find ways that you can
actually really disconnect

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:46.792
from that whole thing?

00:10:46.792 --> 00:10:48.250
COLIN QUINN: I
mean, I haven't yet.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.720
But I mean, because
it's just this thing.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.162
You just a compul--

00:10:54.162 --> 00:10:55.370
you have to go to your phone.

00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:56.300
I never even.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.377
I'm just like, nah.

00:10:57.377 --> 00:10:59.710
And then when you have to
disconnect for an hour or two,

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:00.640
you feel great.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.350
But then you're like, oh,
you catch up, and you feel--

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:04.100
like for the first
minute I'm catching up,

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:05.572
I'm like I'm so happy.

00:11:05.572 --> 00:11:07.030
And then I just
get that sick thing

00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.000
where like I've
seen this 100 times.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.477
Everybody's saying
the same thing.

00:11:10.477 --> 00:11:11.310
I'm saying the same.

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:12.700
Everybody's just the same.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.350
But at first, I'm
just like, yeah,

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:16.870
it feels happy to come
back and say hello.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.330
It's like meeting your friends.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.040
When you meet a friend
for dinner today

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:23.120
that you used to be good
friends with, and you're like,

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.430
oh, I haven't seen
them in a long time.

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:25.850
And you remember the good times.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.666
And then after minute, you're
like, ah, Jesus Christ.

00:11:28.666 --> 00:11:30.010
Do you know what I mean?

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.735
It's the same old
feeling, you know?

00:11:31.735 --> 00:11:31.960
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.293
COLIN QUINN: No offense to
all my friends, but you know.

00:11:36.454 --> 00:11:38.620
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So like
one concept in your show,

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.249
you talk about people not
listening, that we just talk.

00:11:41.249 --> 00:11:42.040
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.620
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Twitter
is a cacophony of shouting.

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.370
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:11:45.370 --> 00:11:48.724
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And so
like how do we fix that?

00:11:48.724 --> 00:11:50.140
Have you seen that
ever in history

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.400
where it's just like people
had stopped listening,

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.316
and then they started?

00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:56.905
Or there was some event that
brought us together more so.

00:11:56.905 --> 00:11:58.030
COLIN QUINN: I mean, right.

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:02.280
I mean, obviously, like
after 9/11 in New York,

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:06.610
the month after 9/11 was
the weirdest New York.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:07.930
No horns honking.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:09.210
Nobody yelling at each other.

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:11.860
It was the strangest time,
where people were just--

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.505
and you're like, oh, people
can act nice if they want.

00:12:14.505 --> 00:12:15.880
Everybody was nice
to each other.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.520
It was a weird, weird time.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.621
And then one day,
people started honking.

00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:22.120
You just started
hearing horns honk.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.770
You hadn't heard
them for a month.

00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:24.950
It was crazy.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:26.410
And then it was back to normal.

00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:28.570
But I mean, my ideas would be--

00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:34.040
like if I could be in charge
of society, what I would do

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:38.680
is I would once a year have
a Constitutional Convention,

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.210
and just have everybody.

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:43.330
Whoever you would
choose to speak.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.300
But everybody in the country
also would have to agree.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.550
Whatever gets said here,
you can't attack it.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:50.890
You can't-- you have
to let it be spoken.

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:54.190
This is the safe space where
everybody says what they want.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.380
You can't have
articles the next day.

00:12:56.380 --> 00:12:58.180
It's not like a
popularity thing.

00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.000
Just kind of everybody speaks.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.170
You get what's considered
the best minds or whatever,

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.297
and just have everybody
speak honestly.

00:13:06.297 --> 00:13:07.380
But you can't attack them.

00:13:07.380 --> 00:13:08.610
Now, I don't know how
you'd pull that off.

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:10.030
But do you know what I mean?

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:12.340
Because part of it is
us, that we're like,

00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:13.470
that person's the problem.

00:13:13.470 --> 00:13:14.470
Do you know what I mean?

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:16.380
It's so easy to pick
one symbolic thing.

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:17.380
Do you know what I mean?

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.300
I talk about Trump.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.410
I say after Trump
leaves, our problems--

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:22.930
the divide doesn't go away.

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.314
He's just a symbol of it.

00:13:24.314 --> 00:13:25.480
But do you know what I mean?

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.090
So people are like, we've
got to get rid of Trump.

00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:27.589
Yeah.

00:13:27.589 --> 00:13:29.200
But once he leaves,
that still doesn't

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.950
change the inherent problems
that divide or whatever.

00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.220
So that's just one problem.

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:37.660
So I'm just saying, instead
of it being just attacking

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.750
a person and thinking you could
crush that symbol by crushing

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.240
that person, it's
like I would like

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:45.840
it to be a more intelligent
conversation about what's

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.500
really--

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.360
where people could be
honest, and say what

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.444
they really feel, and just
try to figure this out.

00:13:50.444 --> 00:13:52.026
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
You've said before,

00:13:52.026 --> 00:13:53.450
like Trump is just one part of--

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.007
like a symptom of that
disconnect that we have.

00:13:56.007 --> 00:13:57.090
COLIN QUINN: Right, right.

00:13:57.090 --> 00:13:58.330
He's just the symptom.

00:13:58.330 --> 00:13:59.160
Yeah.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.826
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
But here in New York,

00:14:00.826 --> 00:14:03.420
we've had plenty of people,
like different people,

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:06.780
and you talk about it in
your book and in your show,

00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:11.280
about how we've gotten over it.

00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:12.910
A new group will come in.

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:18.150
And after a rough time, it will
get integrated to then hate

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.699
the next group that comes.

00:14:19.699 --> 00:14:20.490
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:21.920
Oh, you mean-- yeah, when
I was growing up and stuff.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:22.290
Yeah.

00:14:22.290 --> 00:14:23.331
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:14:23.331 --> 00:14:26.130
So like is living in New York
that experience that people

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:28.560
need to actually to
be able to listen

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.114
or just to be able to coexist?

00:14:33.114 --> 00:14:33.780
COLIN QUINN: No.

00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:36.120
I mean, I feel
like New York is--

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.730
New York-- when I was growing
up, like I look back on it now.

00:14:39.730 --> 00:14:40.230
I grew up.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:43.180
It was very mixed; black,
white, Puerto Rican.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:45.630
And we got along better.

00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:48.900
I would say everybody
understood each other better

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:51.390
than they would say in
places where they wouldn't be

00:14:51.390 --> 00:14:52.900
around each other all the time.

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:55.590
But people seemed to separate.

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:57.810
By the time I was
like 17, people

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.380
were going more away from each
other, towards their own group.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.080
And it was just we
changed a lot ourselves.

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:05.170
Everybody did.

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:06.390
So I don't know.

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.410
I don't know what the--

00:15:07.410 --> 00:15:08.850
I don't know.

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:12.420
You could have a racial
Constitutional Convention

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:15.440
and a red state, blue state
Constitutional Convention,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:17.190
just a country of
conventions where people

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.480
are talking about the time.

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.990
But I mean-- yeah, I mean, I
would say that every time I

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:27.300
watch any show on TV, it just
deteriorates into people just

00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.340
locking in, and just--

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.310
it's just strange that we're
still doing the same thing,

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:35.020
even though the results
are not going the way

00:15:35.020 --> 00:15:36.850
that we would want them to go.

00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:38.600
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So
you have been raised

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.919
in so many parts of Brooklyn.

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:40.710
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:15:40.710 --> 00:15:42.626
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Like
Bensonhurst, Flatbush,

00:15:42.626 --> 00:15:44.580
Park Slope.

00:15:44.580 --> 00:15:45.570
How is it?

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:46.620
Do you go back and visit?

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:47.880
And like these places--

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:48.360
COLIN QUINN: Oh, no.

00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.320
I'm one of those people.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.153
I'm one of those cliche
New York people that

00:15:51.153 --> 00:15:53.550
just sits there and
kicks myself, because we

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.180
used to work on the houses.

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.075
We would work on the
houses in Park Slope

00:15:57.075 --> 00:15:58.200
when people would buy them.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.650
I mean, my friends, they'd
bring in these kids,

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:01.780
like 15-year-olds.

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:02.280
We're 15.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:05.070
We're doing the floors,
doing just all the prep work,

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:05.690
and all that.

00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:07.273
And I'd be going,
look at these idiots

00:16:07.273 --> 00:16:10.080
buying houses in Park
Slope, Sterling Place,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.300
Sixth Avenue, Fifth Avenue.

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.100
I was like, these
people are psychotic.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:15.516
I wanted to live
in Valley Stream.

00:16:15.516 --> 00:16:16.420
That was my dream.

00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.000
I said Valley
Stream, Long Island.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.580
That's where I wanted to live,
because my cousins lived there,

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:20.620
and it was nice.

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:21.641
And I just had no idea.

00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:22.890
And now I look, and I'm like--

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.290
I would've been a billionaire.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:30.330
I would have been bigger than
Howard Schultz right now.

00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.030
I'd be sitting and going, hey,
listen, I came from Brooklyn,

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.113
and now I'm a billionaire.

00:16:34.113 --> 00:16:37.120
I'm going to be President
of the United States.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.330
But I mean, it's crazy.

00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:41.569
And Williamsburg, I
still wouldn't have--

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:42.360
I would never even.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.734
It was like Williamsburg was
like gangs when I was a kid.

00:16:44.734 --> 00:16:46.350
It was just like a
wild neighborhood.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:46.980
Bushwick.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:48.630
I mean, it was crazy.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:50.430
So it's like I wouldn't have--

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:51.630
you know.

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.172
I look back on my
life, and I realize

00:16:53.172 --> 00:16:54.713
it was-- basically
what I'm saying is

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.160
it was an unmitigated failure.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.290
Instead of being
a comedian sitting

00:16:58.290 --> 00:17:00.480
at a bar doing an
Irish accent, I

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.310
should have been a
real estate mogul.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:07.530
DAVID WINDMUELLER: How
did you get into comedy?

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:09.420
COLIN QUINN: I was bartending.

00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:11.244
I was a bartender
and a waiter at all

00:17:11.244 --> 00:17:12.410
these different restaurants.

00:17:12.410 --> 00:17:14.035
And I was like, I
wanted to be an actor

00:17:14.035 --> 00:17:15.743
in the back of my
head, but I didn't know

00:17:15.743 --> 00:17:17.130
how to go about being an actor.

00:17:17.130 --> 00:17:20.819
It was like I was just
a haphazard person.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:23.819
And then, luckily--
this is the early '80s--

00:17:23.819 --> 00:17:25.380
I started doing comedy.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.089
And comedy was just
starting to boom.

00:17:28.089 --> 00:17:29.830
But I didn't realize
that at the time.

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:33.060
So I started, and
I'd wait on line.

00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:37.800
And every week on the line,
every week, almost every--

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.200
most weeks it was
me, Chris Rock,

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.899
Adam Sandler waiting on
these lines to get into it

00:17:42.899 --> 00:17:44.440
like an open mic
and do five minutes.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.360
And we all got to
know each other.

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.350
And so it was like
1984 probably.

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:51.270
And then we started to
pass at these clubs.

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:52.728
And everybody
started-- it was just

00:17:52.728 --> 00:17:54.810
this little group of comedians.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.910
It was so much
smaller than today.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.170
In some ways, it was easier.

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.711
I mean, there were
a lot of comedians

00:17:59.711 --> 00:18:03.810
around that didn't make it, but
it was just such a small world

00:18:03.810 --> 00:18:05.640
compared to today.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.470
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
Did your parents--

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:10.614
were they big fans of this?

00:18:10.614 --> 00:18:12.030
Did they support
you through that?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:13.613
COLIN QUINN: Oh, I
mean, I was already

00:18:13.613 --> 00:18:14.850
like in early 20's by then.

00:18:14.850 --> 00:18:16.590
I wasn't even living at home.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:17.439
So it was like--

00:18:17.439 --> 00:18:19.230
they weren't living
with each other anyway.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:20.630
So it was like--

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.787
yeah, they were glad
I was doing something.

00:18:22.787 --> 00:18:24.870
They were just like, yeah,
that's great, you know?

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:26.410
Nobody thought about comedy.

00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:28.910
It was just like comedy
was like a crazy thing.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:29.250
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.330
COLIN QUINN: Like in those days.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.500
Like, eh, this guy's a comedian.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.040
People were just--
it was so much easier

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:35.290
to be a comedian in those
days, because you would just

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.249
go on a stage, and people
would start getting excited.

00:18:38.249 --> 00:18:40.290
There's somebody going to
be a comedian on stage,

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.460
like nobody ever saw
a comedian before.

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.890
Now people are
like, ah, my cousin

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:46.774
does that for seven years,
and I tried it for two years.

00:18:46.774 --> 00:18:47.940
It's not a big deal anymore.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.362
But back then, everybody
was like, woo, comedian.

00:18:51.362 --> 00:18:52.290
DAVID WINDMUELLER: OK.

00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:57.340
So you lived in Park Slope for--

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:59.600
COLIN QUINN: For
most of my childhood.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.740
I grew up in Flatbush, then
Park Slope, then Bensonhurst.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:04.240
I lived with my girlfriend then.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:05.680
Astoria, Queens.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.840
Then I lived in Staten Island
for a brief period of time.

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:09.840
I don't talk about that.

00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:11.990
No, I'm kidding.

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:16.250
And then I lived in Manhattan.

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:20.320
I lived in like
Yorkville, like East 78th

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.700
between First and York.

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:24.160
Then I lived on 45th
between 9th and 10th.

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.590
But in those days,
this was in the '80s,

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:28.460
those apartments were so cheap.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.301
I won't even say it, because
everybody will kill me.

00:19:31.301 --> 00:19:32.300
But it was like really--

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:36.010
I lived on East 10th between
A and B, like $400 a month.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:37.685
It was almost like
a whole floor.

00:19:37.685 --> 00:19:41.080
It was crazy, because they were
considered bad neighborhoods

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:41.580
back then.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.220
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:43.040
I read your book.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:47.500
It's like it's funny, and it's
also a lot of autobiographical.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:50.800
I don't think I've ever read
a book where the person gets

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.000
punched so much.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.440
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:56.080
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Like
all over, every chapter,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.320
you get beat up.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.330
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.630
Well, like I said, I was a very
what they call beer muscles.

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:06.310
I was a very tough guy in here.

00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:07.960
So I would go to
bars, and I always

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.539
wanted to be 6' 8", like
240, like my whole life.

00:20:10.539 --> 00:20:12.580
Even when I was a little
kid, I resented the fact

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.455
that like I'd see
Connie Hawkins, who

00:20:14.455 --> 00:20:15.560
was my childhood idol.

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.685
He was a basketball player.

00:20:16.685 --> 00:20:19.024
And I was like, how come he's
6' 8", and I'm not 6' 8"?

00:20:19.024 --> 00:20:21.190
So my whole life, I was--
so when I would get drunk,

00:20:21.190 --> 00:20:22.570
I'd be like look
at that bouncer.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:25.420
How come he gets to be 6'
5", and I'm-- you know.

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.490
So I'd just flick my
cigarettes at them.

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:28.750
And then they beat--

00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:30.807
they'd beat me out, literally.

00:20:30.807 --> 00:20:32.140
I didn't just get punched a lot.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:33.820
I got punched out
into the street,

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.280
like the old school
beatings where

00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.782
you'd go flying out of the club,
because I'd go after hours.

00:20:39.782 --> 00:20:41.740
There's a lot of after
hours clubs in New York.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:44.560
So I was a bartender all night,
so I'd go drinking after hours.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.200
So it would be like 6:00 in the
morning, 7:00 in the morning.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.920
I'm walking out of the bar,
like my shirt's all ripped,

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.312
all bloody, walking home.

00:20:53.312 --> 00:20:54.270
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Wow.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.020
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.120
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Well,
actually, it ends up

00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.530
being part of your philosophy.

00:20:58.530 --> 00:20:59.370
You talk about--

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.744
I think a friend
of yours, Harry,

00:21:00.744 --> 00:21:03.392
mentioned there's a never
punched in the face club.

00:21:03.392 --> 00:21:04.641
COLIN QUINN: Oh, right, right.

00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:05.070
DAVID WINDMUELLER: There
are two types of people;

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:06.410
those who have been
punched in the face,

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.409
and those who haven't.

00:21:07.409 --> 00:21:08.200
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:09.360
My friend came up with that one.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.400
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:12.450
That people that
have a certain amount

00:21:12.450 --> 00:21:13.740
of respect for each other.

00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:14.430
COLIN QUINN: Right, right.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.990
DAVID WINDMUELLER: That
others that haven't.

00:21:15.990 --> 00:21:16.300
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.070
They would just say--

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:18.944
well, that's another
thing from social media.

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:21.320
People talk a lot, those
digital soldiers, whatever,

00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.360
computer guy.

00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.770
And so people can just
say a lot of nasty stuff.

00:21:24.770 --> 00:21:26.902
It's like this stuff is
going to lead to war.

00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:28.860
That's why I worry
sometimes, because I'm like,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.810
you can't just keep
talking to people,

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.344
ridiculing, attacking people.

00:21:33.344 --> 00:21:34.760
People are going
to react one day.

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760
Do you know what I mean?

00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.510
It's just not human
nature to just think

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:41.520
people are just going
to take your abuse.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.750
It's just the way it goes.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.910
It's been proven in
every society, including

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:45.840
ours, many times.

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.130
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
But maybe part of that

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:49.470
is that people haven't been
either punched in the face--

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.900
I'm sure we can fix that--

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:54.519
or that people haven't
been punched in the wallet.

00:21:54.519 --> 00:21:55.310
COLIN QUINN: Right.

00:21:55.310 --> 00:21:56.310
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Inequality
is one of the things

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.500
that people talk about greatly.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.260
COLIN QUINN: Sure.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.176
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Like
with people driving up

00:22:00.176 --> 00:22:01.170
with Lamborghinis.

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:03.870
COLIN QUINN: Oh, right, like
lecturing some sheet metal

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:06.335
worker from the red
states and stuff.

00:22:06.335 --> 00:22:06.960
Yeah, oh, yeah.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.520
I mean, it's real stuff.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.450
It's like people just
talking, and spraying people.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.820
A lot of people in the
media or in showbiz,

00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:17.700
whatever, just telling people,
look, this is how you have to--

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.680
the problem to me is like,
everybody, the whole country

00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.120
is built on the fact that you
get to decide for yourself how

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:24.810
to think.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:28.360
That's the only thing that
everybody kind of says, well,

00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.670
that's one thing we came up.

00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:31.260
And now everybody's just
trying to force everybody

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:32.426
to think the way they think.

00:22:32.426 --> 00:22:33.360
And it's not working.

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.470
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:22:35.470 --> 00:22:35.970
You grew up.

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:37.215
Your parents were teachers.

00:22:37.215 --> 00:22:37.740
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.870
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And so
how did that shape you?

00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:41.540
What type of teachers?

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:46.710
COLIN QUINN: I mean, because
they were-- my parents were--

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:48.560
my mother was just--

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.180
well, I almost said
just a housewife.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:52.680
My mother was only
became a teacher

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.640
after my parents got divorced.

00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.240
She went to college.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.830
She didn't go to
college before that.

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:58.689
So she did it later in life,
and she taught special ed.

00:22:58.689 --> 00:22:59.730
My father taught English.

00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:02.660
And so she was a special ed
teacher all over Brooklyn.

00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:07.800
And so yeah, it just
taught me to like reading.

00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.280
So I loved to read
from early age.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.054
That was my other
part of my thing

00:23:12.054 --> 00:23:13.470
with my jacket and
my Irish thing.

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.470
I always had a book.

00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:15.944
I usually had like a play.

00:23:15.944 --> 00:23:17.610
Like I said, I was
going to be an actor.

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:19.140
So I always had
like a little play

00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:21.960
tucked in my pants pocket
or my jacket pocket.

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.100
And then I'd be at the--

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.380
did you ever see like
a pompous asshole

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:28.110
at the bar who breaks out a play
and starts reading by himself?

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:29.550
That was me.

00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:32.240
Strindberg, I'd be like, yeah.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.320
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So
did you get any plays?

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.397
Did you do that?

00:23:35.397 --> 00:23:36.980
COLIN QUINN: Did I
get into any plays?

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:37.980
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.450
COLIN QUINN: I got in two plays.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:44.024
And one was just this weird--

00:23:44.024 --> 00:23:45.440
I mean, I can't
even tell you what

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.220
they were about to this day.

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:48.290
But they were like these
weird experimental plays

00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:50.510
in the East Village
in the early '80s,

00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:53.150
where one was just some
lady who was pretending

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:54.540
to swim the whole time.

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.180
And then I had to carry--

00:23:56.180 --> 00:23:58.720
but I had to carry her around,
like I was like the swim.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.930
I mean, I was in
pretty good shape

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:02.471
when I think about it, carrying
somebody around a whole play,

00:24:02.471 --> 00:24:03.154
you know?

00:24:03.154 --> 00:24:04.070
I mean, I was like 23.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:05.736
Even at the end of
the play, I was like,

00:24:05.736 --> 00:24:07.260
Jesus Christ, this
is really hard.

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.764
And then I was in some other
play where it was just like--

00:24:11.764 --> 00:24:13.430
I can't even remember
what it was about.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.900
It was just insane.

00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:18.350
But I was the worst.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:19.917
I was the worst employee.

00:24:19.917 --> 00:24:22.000
When I was drinking, all
I would be thinking about

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.140
was, yeah, just
sitting there smoking,

00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:26.090
plotting how to get more drinks.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:27.590
So I didn't even
care about anything

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.760
I was doing other than that.

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:30.560
Even when I bartended
I'd be like trying

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.601
to get back to my drinks.

00:24:31.601 --> 00:24:34.430
So I was really a
compulsive personality.

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:35.980
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
So how did you

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.730
get to "Remote Control,"
which I remember.

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:38.641
It was super fun.

00:24:38.641 --> 00:24:39.890
COLIN QUINN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:42.280
I was doing stand-up.

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.220
I had quit drinking.

00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.290
So that's why I did
stand-up, because I was like,

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.248
I have nothing to lose.

00:24:46.248 --> 00:24:48.010
That was the only
thing I really liked.

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:50.176
I had nothing to lose, so
it was like they took away

00:24:50.176 --> 00:24:50.840
my best friend.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.950
So I started doing
stand-up, because I

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:54.116
was like, I don't care if
I bomb in front of people.

00:24:54.116 --> 00:24:56.240
That's nothing compared to this.

00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.700
And so I was doing stand-up
for like three years.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.750
And then they just
saw me at a club.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:04.850
And then they hired me
because of my voice.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:07.080
And my voice was
even more like this,

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.564
because I smoked
three packs a day.

00:25:08.564 --> 00:25:09.480
So I talked like this.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.200
Even though I was like
28, I talked like this.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.520
So they thought it was funny.

00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:15.995
I thought they were hiring
me for my brilliant comedy.

00:25:15.995 --> 00:25:17.040
It was a disconnect.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.481
So I thought, oh, they get
that I'm a great comic.

00:25:19.481 --> 00:25:21.230
They were just like
making fun of the fact

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:23.030
that my voice was so stupid.

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:26.840
So the first week we had a big
fight, me and the MTV bosses,

00:25:26.840 --> 00:25:28.420
where it was like,
I quit this show.

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:29.420
Do you know what I mean?

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.946
Because I was like, I'm not
doing commercials for you.

00:25:32.946 --> 00:25:34.070
I just had this whole idea.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.470
I'm like, well, I've got
to do the advertisements.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:39.590
So I ended up I was so
resentful that I ended up

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:43.040
doing the advertising
like really sarcastically

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:46.220
for their products, to where
the people that advertised,

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.830
Casio or Mitsubishi,
like they're like,

00:25:48.830 --> 00:25:50.290
this guy's disrespectful.

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.520
Either he starts doing our
advertisements sincerely

00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:53.276
or he's out.

00:25:53.276 --> 00:25:54.650
And I'm like, I'm
not doing shit.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:56.480
But the show was on the air.

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.300
So all the kids that
were watching the show

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.550
loved it, because I
guess, they were like,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.100
oh, this guy's insulting the
products while he's doing it.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:05.810
So then they wanted to keep me.

00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:10.395
So I lucked out that I was so
snotty that kids were like, ah,

00:26:10.395 --> 00:26:11.714
ha-ha, like they liked it.

00:26:11.714 --> 00:26:13.380
And then suddenly
advertisers were like,

00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:15.620
oh, yeah, do them his way.

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.082
DAVID WINDMUELLER: That's great.

00:26:17.082 --> 00:26:20.120
And how did that-- how did
you get onto "SNL" from there?

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.930
COLIN QUINN: Well, then
after MTV was over,

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.100
I was right back to like--

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:26.420
I was really--

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:29.290
I mean, I had to move
back in with my mother.

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.040
She was living in Bay
Ridge at the time.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:32.450
I had to move in with my mother.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.241
And people would see
me on the block going,

00:26:34.241 --> 00:26:35.720
weren't you just on TV?

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:37.040
And I was back.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.280
I had no money, because MTV
didn't really pay that much.

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.859
And it was just a
combination of things.

00:26:42.859 --> 00:26:43.400
I don't know.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:43.700
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Free snacks.

00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.070
COLIN QUINN: I was literally
living with my mother

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:48.650
and my niece in this apartment.

00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:55.590
And so then I end up getting a
writing job, "In Living Color."

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:56.360
So I moved to LA.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.115
"In Living Color" was in
its last couple of years.

00:26:59.115 --> 00:27:00.990
So they brought me on
to write for that show.

00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:03.380
So that gave me
enough to live on.

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.609
And then "SNL" hired
me as a writer.

00:27:05.609 --> 00:27:08.150
And then once I was on there,
I started doing stuff on there.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.080
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Was
it weird to take over

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.170
for Norm Macdonald?

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:10.470
Was it awkward?

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:11.719
COLIN QUINN: Ah, the weirdest.

00:27:11.719 --> 00:27:13.350
Yeah, it was really awkward.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.340
It was bad.

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.430
Like speaking of social
media, at that time,

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:18.440
social media was almost new.

00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.180
People just barely--

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.870
I don't know if was
Myspace or whatever,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.450
but it had just started.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.520
And I was one of
the first people

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:29.750
that had to deal with the
fact that this new guy sucks.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:32.740
You're fat, you fat neck.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.820
I'm sick and tired of
seeing his stupid face.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.140
And I was like, what that?

00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:37.894
I was so mad, but
it was like I was

00:27:37.894 --> 00:27:39.560
one of the first
people that had to deal

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.480
with like feedback
on that digital level

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:44.900
that people didn't like you.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.890
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So
all over the globe.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:46.640
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.762
And it was really interesting.

00:27:48.762 --> 00:27:51.095
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So do you
watch "Saturday Night Live"

00:27:51.095 --> 00:27:51.260
now?

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.801
Do you think it's
changed drastically

00:27:52.801 --> 00:27:53.864
from when you were there?

00:27:53.864 --> 00:27:54.530
COLIN QUINN: No.

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:55.988
I mean, I watch it
once in a while.

00:27:55.988 --> 00:27:58.805
But I mean, I'll watch
it like everybody else,

00:27:58.805 --> 00:28:01.150
where it's online Tuesday
morning or something.

00:28:01.150 --> 00:28:02.450
Do you know what I mean?

00:28:02.450 --> 00:28:04.360
I'm like, oh, let's
see what this one is.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.471
And it's the same.

00:28:05.471 --> 00:28:07.220
I mean, it's the same
as when I was there.

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:08.720
I see it from the side of like--

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.200
I'm like, oh, that person.

00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.080
I would just imagine how it was
trying to get that sketch on.

00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:15.080
So when I'm watching, I'm
like, oh, I bet that--

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.236
and look at that person.

00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:17.610
I could tell their
lines got cut.

00:28:17.610 --> 00:28:18.800
They're just standing
there in the back,

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:20.360
like why do they have
me in this sketch?

00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.830
So you know it
from like whatever.

00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:25.254
Like anything else, you just
look at the different angles.

00:28:25.254 --> 00:28:27.170
DAVID WINDMUELLER: I'm
going to change topics.

00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:29.720
something that-- you have your
one year anniversary coming up.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:30.530
COLIN QUINN: Oh,
my heart attack.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:30.830
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:31.820
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.220
DAVID WINDMUELLER: That
happened on Valentine's Day.

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.130
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.089
DAVID WINDMUELLER: How
has that changed you?

00:28:36.089 --> 00:28:37.130
COLIN QUINN: Don't worry.

00:28:37.130 --> 00:28:38.820
My girlfriend noted
it at the time.

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.210
She goes, yeah, Valentine's
Day, interesting.

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:41.930
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
People-- yeah,

00:28:41.930 --> 00:28:44.080
that's pretty drastic to
get out of Valentine's Day.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:45.600
COLIN QUINN: You don't have
to Carl Jung to figure out

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.640
that one.

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.960
And yeah, I just
had a heart attack.

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.180
I just came out of the gym.

00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.240
And I was like, oh,
man, I pulled a muscle.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:57.270
And I was like,
oh, shoot, I think

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:58.940
I'm having a heart attack.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.190
And then the next thing you
know I'm in the ambulance.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.980
And I was like losing air.

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:04.210
And I'm like I'm actually--

00:29:04.210 --> 00:29:07.452
I said, I might die right
now, because I'm losing air,

00:29:07.452 --> 00:29:08.410
and I couldn't breathe.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:09.430
I'm like, it hurts.

00:29:09.430 --> 00:29:11.922
A heart attack like
physically hurts.

00:29:11.922 --> 00:29:12.880
I didn't think it hurt.

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:14.770
I thought you went numb.

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:15.610
You don't go numb.

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:18.610
It's like something pushing,
like my elbow in your heart.

00:29:18.610 --> 00:29:19.750
I was like, ah.

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:21.700
And then I was like,
I could actually die.

00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.915
It was so weird, because I
always thought I'd get a--

00:29:23.915 --> 00:29:26.290
I thought it'd be like a doctor
would sit me down and go,

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:29.860
listen, you have two years.

00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:31.780
Get your affairs in order.

00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:33.100
Take care of business.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.280
I'll put out all my
mission statements online.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.315
Visit all my enemies.

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:42.670
Get forgiveness from
all by past things.

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:45.250
And then, but no, it was
like, sometimes it just ends.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:47.810
You forget about
that part of dying.

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:51.532
Sometimes it's not a big
dramatic two year bad movie

00:29:51.532 --> 00:29:52.490
of the week type thing.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.590
It's just you just die.

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.490
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
So did you change

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:55.750
anything in that last year?

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:56.500
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:57.640
I mean, I changed.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.806
I mean, everyone was like,
did you change your diet?

00:29:59.806 --> 00:30:03.310
But I'm like, look, they're
giving me medication,

00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:05.020
like heavy medication.

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:08.110
It's disrespectful to
science and the advances

00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:10.870
they've made if I then
take the medication,

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:12.970
and don't trust that
their medication works

00:30:12.970 --> 00:30:14.260
by having to change my diet.

00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.301
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:20.050
COLIN QUINN: That's my theory.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:23.269
DAVID WINDMUELLER: But
have you visited enemies?

00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:24.310
COLIN QUINN: The enemies?

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:25.770
No, I haven't visited them yet.

00:30:25.770 --> 00:30:28.780
Because it's-- but yeah, I do
think in terms of like, oh,

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.510
what would I do if I really
only had a finite amount of time

00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:32.010
to live?

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.010
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.185
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:30:34.185 --> 00:30:35.560
COLIN QUINN: I
mean, I know I do.

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:37.590
I mean, I know I'm
going to die now.

00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:39.844
Like before I kind of knew,
but you never really--

00:30:39.844 --> 00:30:42.010
you don't know for sure
until you're actually dying.

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.900
And you're like, oh, no,
this is going to happen.

00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:48.609
But it hasn't-- it doesn't have
like this big effect on you

00:30:48.609 --> 00:30:50.650
that you want it to, where
you're like, hey, man,

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:51.441
everything's great.

00:30:51.441 --> 00:30:52.760
Do you know what I mean?

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:55.000
I'm still annoyed by
every little thing.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.700
Just sitting, driving
around, another train.

00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:59.440
Everything's just the same.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.120
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
So as a comedian,

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.578
you've been doing
this for decades.

00:31:02.578 --> 00:31:03.639
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:31:03.639 --> 00:31:05.680
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Has it
changed drastically now

00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.630
with what you can do?

00:31:07.630 --> 00:31:12.310
And does that change what you
do, or like you have a pass?

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.060
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:18.160
I mean, look, you can only
do what you think is funny.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.770
Of course, everything changes.

00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:20.800
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:24.760
Everything starts out for
the right reasons, I think.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:28.510
People, like even
political correctness

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:30.800
started out for
the right reasons.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.600
But eventually, it
becomes mob rule.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.670
Everybody's like, you
feel good telling people.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:36.670
Do you know what I mean?

00:31:36.670 --> 00:31:38.650
Like, yeah, people
can't say this.

00:31:38.650 --> 00:31:41.110
So it starts out
for a good reason,

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:45.970
and then it becomes twisted by
just the general idea of people

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.890
get-- everybody
just gets involved.

00:31:47.890 --> 00:31:52.630
But I mean, comedy,
it has changed.

00:31:52.630 --> 00:31:55.780
It has changed in the
sense that there's

00:31:55.780 --> 00:32:00.330
a lot of things that don't
get discussed in comedy, just

00:32:00.330 --> 00:32:02.320
because people are
like, that's off limits.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.600
And that's stupid,
because it's comedy.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.350
You're supposed to
discuss certain things

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.820
if you can make them funny.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.705
That being said, so like a
lot of people would be like,

00:32:12.705 --> 00:32:14.330
well, I want to say
what I want to say.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:17.881
And like I find myself defending
the rights of comedians

00:32:17.881 --> 00:32:18.880
to say things sometimes.

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.959
I'm like, I don't
even agree with that.

00:32:20.959 --> 00:32:22.500
I don't even like
what you're saying.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.310
But I've still got to defend
it on general principle,

00:32:24.310 --> 00:32:25.570
just because I'm a comedian.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:28.126
Do you know what I mean?

00:32:28.126 --> 00:32:29.500
So you're sticking
with the idea,

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.750
even though I'm like, I've
got to defend your dumb joke?

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:32.874
I don't even find it funny.

00:32:32.874 --> 00:32:33.760
It's shock humor.

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:34.720
I don't go for that.

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:35.761
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Right.

00:32:35.761 --> 00:32:39.557
COLIN QUINN: So it's a
weird time for everybody

00:32:39.557 --> 00:32:40.765
with everything, I feel like.

00:32:40.765 --> 00:32:42.980
And comedy is just one
of those other things.

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:43.980
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:45.340
In your show, you do that.

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.624
You are very blunt
about different topics.

00:32:47.624 --> 00:32:48.540
COLIN QUINN: Oh, yeah.

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.100
I've always-- like
I said, I just

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:54.410
feel like if you make it
funny, then people will

00:32:54.410 --> 00:32:55.900
more likely go, that's funny.

00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:56.900
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Yeah.

00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:59.290
I mean, like you do like a
celebrity roast of the states.

00:32:59.290 --> 00:33:00.706
COLIN QUINN: Oh,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:33:00.706 --> 00:33:04.195
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So like each
one, you call out all of them.

00:33:04.195 --> 00:33:04.945
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:33:04.945 --> 00:33:07.142
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And
give them something.

00:33:07.142 --> 00:33:08.350
Were any of those hard to do?

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:10.460
Do you want to share
any of those right now?

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.260
COLIN QUINN: I'll
share them, but I

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.280
don't think they're hard to do.

00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:13.988
I mean, I don't think
they're hard like--

00:33:13.988 --> 00:33:16.030
the New York story was
more like people are like,

00:33:16.030 --> 00:33:18.050
you're talking about
everybody's ethnicity,

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:20.466
but people liked it, because
everybody thought-- you know.

00:33:20.466 --> 00:33:22.360
Obviously, he's not
trying to attack.

00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.660
I'm not trying to slip
anything by anybody.

00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.570
I feel like that's a
big problem in comedy.

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.486
If you're trying to be
slick and say something

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:30.640
without taking ownership
of it, then you're

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.850
going to be in trouble.

00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:34.830
But my state ones is like,
well, I say New York--

00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:37.000
I just talk about the
fall of every state.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.420
New York was once the
home of drunken writers

00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:42.370
at the Algonquin roundtable.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.270
And now it's drunken
texters at SantaCon.

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:51.910
And then Massachusetts, where
once Sam Adams pouring tea

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.300
into Boston Harbor, now it's
Fenway fans pouring Sam Adams

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:58.090
onto Yankee outfielder heads.

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:00.370
And just I go over all the--

00:34:00.370 --> 00:34:02.320
just mocking every
state as you go along.

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:02.950
DAVID WINDMUELLER: It's great.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:03.870
It was funny, very funny.

00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:04.953
COLIN QUINN: Thanks, yeah.

00:34:04.953 --> 00:34:07.179
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And before
I ask my last question,

00:34:07.179 --> 00:34:08.179
we have two microphones.

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:09.639
So if you want to
ask something, feel--

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:09.850
COLIN QUINN: Wait.

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:10.550
What about you?

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.409
What about your-- I'm sorry.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:12.639
What about your state Virginia?

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:13.805
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Virginia.

00:34:13.805 --> 00:34:15.969
COLIN QUINN: I go Virginia,
the snobs of the south.

00:34:15.969 --> 00:34:17.802
Stop trying to be
Connecticut, you hayseeds.

00:34:22.583 --> 00:34:23.874
DAVID WINDMUELLER: That's good.

00:34:23.874 --> 00:34:26.320
No, that's funny.

00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:27.820
COLIN QUINN: You
think that's funny.

00:34:30.761 --> 00:34:33.219
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So again,
we're going to have questions.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:36.190
So feel free to line up if
you have questions for Colin.

00:34:36.190 --> 00:34:36.980
The last one.

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.763
You've hosted a comics
talk show, "Tough Crowd."

00:34:40.763 --> 00:34:41.679
COLIN QUINN: Oh, yeah.

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:42.670
DAVID WINDMUELLER:
That was awesome.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:43.503
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:34:43.503 --> 00:34:44.949
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Very tough.

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.796
You helped our troops
with your USO tour.

00:34:46.796 --> 00:34:48.504
COLIN QUINN: Oh, yeah,
we did a USO tour.

00:34:48.504 --> 00:34:49.629
DAVID WINDMUELLER: So nice.

00:34:49.629 --> 00:34:52.900
And you have your
now an online--

00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:54.489
you've had online
shows, "Cop Show."

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.550
COLIN QUINN: "Cop
Show," it's my baby.

00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:58.600
DAVID WINDMUELLER: And
so, like what's next?

00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.930
More directing, writing?

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:00.597
What's going on?

00:35:00.597 --> 00:35:02.554
COLIN QUINN: I would like
to do more cop shows,

00:35:02.554 --> 00:35:03.790
now that you mentioned it.

00:35:03.790 --> 00:35:05.980
That's really my-- do
you know what I mean?

00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.650
In fact, now that I'm here at
Google, I might as well say,

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:11.560
the problem with "Cop Show"
is that you didn't watch it.

00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.060
And you guys know
how to get it out.

00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:15.790
It's got like 100,000
views per show.

00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.150
You need 8 million.

00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:18.580
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Mm-hmm.

00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:19.330
COLIN QUINN: It's
too late anyway.

00:35:19.330 --> 00:35:20.140
But go watch it.

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:22.037
It's funny.

00:35:22.037 --> 00:35:22.870
I was going to say--

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:24.369
I was going to pull
a strategy move,

00:35:24.369 --> 00:35:26.200
and I was like,
I'm over my head.

00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.040
I don't know what
I'm talking about.

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:29.200
So everybody just watch it.

00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.080
It is funny, though.

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:30.560
DAVID WINDMUELLER: It is funny.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.540
COLIN QUINN: It's funny, right?

00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.664
I swear to god, it's funny.

00:35:34.827 --> 00:35:36.910
If you don't like it and
you see me in the street,

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.220
you punch me in the face.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:42.952
Obviously, it's my go-to move,
getting punched in the face.

00:35:42.952 --> 00:35:44.160
DAVID WINDMUELLER: All right.

00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.243
We'll go to the questions.

00:35:45.243 --> 00:35:46.269
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:35:46.269 --> 00:35:46.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.500
Thank you so much for coming.

00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.785
I watched "A New York
Story" a few years ago,

00:35:50.785 --> 00:35:51.910
and I thought it was great.

00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:52.760
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.390
AUDIENCE: I went to the
Minetta Lane Theater.

00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:58.146
But my question for you is--

00:35:58.146 --> 00:35:59.520
you touched on
this a little bit.

00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.740
But there is a
lot of controversy

00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.350
around what some
comedians talk about,

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:09.010
like certain topics
having to be off limits,

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:13.670
like racial jokes or sexuality
jokes, and things like that.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:15.760
And I struggle with
that personally,

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:18.310
because some of the jokes,
I do find funny, personally.

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:20.650
So I have that struggle myself.

00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:22.700
I'm like, oh, shoot, like
I don't want to laugh,

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.480
but it's making me laugh.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.490
What is your
perspective on that?

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.590
Should some of these
jokes be off limits?

00:36:29.590 --> 00:36:32.770
And that internal struggle
that some people may have,

00:36:32.770 --> 00:36:36.280
like is it warranted?

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.750
Should we move past it?

00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:41.070
Because I don't necessarily
think that everyone's bigoted,

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.720
but I understand the rationale
for not having these jokes.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:47.500
So it's sort of a struggle
for me, personally.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.250
COLIN QUINN: Yeah.

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:51.240
Well, that's-- yeah, I
mean, it's a good question,

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:54.150
because everybody gets
offended by something.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:56.180
I always quote this
guy Jack Simmons,

00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:01.560
who was a comedian from
the '80s, where I'm from,

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.720
the place where I came from.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.310
But he used to
always go onstage,

00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.930
and when people would moan,
he would go, come on, folks.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:07.770
It's comedy.

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:09.360
Somebody has got to get hurt.

00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:10.440
And that's the thing.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.980
So we've just shifted
what's offensive now.

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.046
So it's kind of like, there
are things that offend me.

00:37:17.046 --> 00:37:18.420
There are things
that offend you.

00:37:18.420 --> 00:37:21.030
And like I say in
the show, I say,

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:23.340
since they've gotten
rid of ethnic humor

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.810
from mainstream society, because
they felt it encourages racism,

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:28.350
I go, that's proven.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.740
Racism is gone.

00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.654
So it was a great success.

00:37:31.654 --> 00:37:32.910
Do you know what I mean?

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.440
I feel like there's too much
focus on stand-up material.

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.520
Everything is--
stand-up is not nice.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.080
And sometimes people
say things that

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.480
make me mad in
stand-up, all the time.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:49.380
But like you say, if you're
laughing, you shouldn't feel,

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:52.320
ugh, why am I laughing at this?

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.380
Like suddenly it makes
you into something that--

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.590
there's just a-- there's no--

00:37:58.590 --> 00:37:59.700
what do they call it?

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:03.060
Suspension of disbelief, which
is a term that always bugged

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:06.020
me, because I think it supposed
to be a suspension of belief,

00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.200
and suspension of disbelief.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.000
But another time.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.870
But anyway, the point is,
like when you're at a movie,

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:15.110
you say, OK, I'm
going into this world.

00:38:15.110 --> 00:38:17.890
And stand-up, I know
it's not the same thing.

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.880
There is a lot more
truth to stand-up.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.230
So it isn't all just jokes.

00:38:22.230 --> 00:38:22.730
I get it.

00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:25.200
But yeah, I don't feel--

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.630
I feel like it's
going down a path

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.380
that I can't imagine how there
will be jokes in five years,

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.910
because if everything falls
under this standard of,

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:34.800
you know what?

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:37.480
That group of people,
that's a little bit off.

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.560
I mean, you'll see it
now like in stand-up.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.780
Somebody will say any
name of any group,

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.190
and people are like [GASPING].

00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:49.210
Just before they
even get to the joke.

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:51.240
So it's like people say,
celebrate diversity.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.175
Just don't point out
anybody is different.

00:38:53.175 --> 00:38:54.690
Do you know what I mean?

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.520
Well, there's got
to be at some point,

00:38:57.520 --> 00:39:00.400
someone's got to come with
a little clear point of what

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:00.900
it is.

00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:02.550
It's just people marking down.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:04.025
OK, that's an 8.5.

00:39:04.025 --> 00:39:05.400
We're just going
to have to start

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.450
doing it based on, out of 10,
how offensive is that joke?

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.250
And how wrong am
I for enjoying it?

00:39:11.250 --> 00:39:11.900
2.4.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:12.900
Do you know what I mean?

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.540
Because stand-up gets to be in
this weird place where it will

00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:16.500
be--

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:19.785
we might as well be in
the 1950s at a glee club,

00:39:19.785 --> 00:39:21.660
where you're just like
everything's positive.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.451
I mean, in stand-up,
everything's negative.

00:39:23.451 --> 00:39:24.640
That's what it's about.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:25.350
So I don't know.

00:39:25.350 --> 00:39:26.550
I don't know.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:28.740
But I don't-- personally,
I don't like it.

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:29.730
I'll say that.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.669
I don't think it's
good for stand-up.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:32.460
And I don't think--

00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.579
I think most stand-ups agree
with me that it's weird.

00:39:35.579 --> 00:39:37.620
And you don't want it to
become the kind of thing

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.210
where stand-up is just
motivational speaking,

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:44.670
or people are just lecturing the
audience, which happens a lot,

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:45.960
sometimes I feel like.

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.240
Where suddenly it was like,
now, this is what goes on.

00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:50.580
And you're like, OK, we're
within the parameters.

00:39:50.580 --> 00:39:53.334
Like, stand-up punches
down sometimes.

00:39:53.334 --> 00:39:54.250
It doesn't just punch.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:56.208
People are like, stand-up
shouldn't punch down.

00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:56.910
Yeah, it should.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.660
It punches up.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:58.470
It punches down.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:00.300
It elbows you in the
side of the face.

00:40:00.300 --> 00:40:01.470
It's dirty.

00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:02.240
Stand-up is wrong.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:03.240
Do you know what I mean?

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:05.130
So that's the other
part of it that's

00:40:05.130 --> 00:40:07.094
kind of getting
into a weird area.

00:40:07.094 --> 00:40:09.510
I realize that I've spent the
last eight minutes answering

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:10.093
this question.

00:40:10.093 --> 00:40:13.995
And don't think I'm not
aware that I've said nothing.

00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.490
Such are the times we live in.

00:40:23.437 --> 00:40:24.270
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:25.103
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:40:28.482 --> 00:40:30.690
AUDIENCE: Can you speak in
your Northern Irish accent

00:40:30.690 --> 00:40:32.274
for the next like--
until you're done?

00:40:32.274 --> 00:40:33.731
COLIN QUINN: For
the next how long?

00:40:33.731 --> 00:40:34.527
AUDIENCE: What?

00:40:34.527 --> 00:40:35.610
COLIN QUINN: For how long?

00:40:35.610 --> 00:40:37.140
AUDIENCE: Just until
we're done, I guess.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.556
Or until someone
tells you, please

00:40:38.556 --> 00:40:41.330
don't speak in an Irish accent,
because I don't understand you.

00:40:41.330 --> 00:40:42.650
COLIN QUINN: (IRISH
ACCENT) Yes, I will.

00:40:42.650 --> 00:40:43.500
I'll do it like that.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:43.940
AUDIENCE: Awesome.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:44.380
Thank you.

00:40:44.380 --> 00:40:46.950
COLIN QUINN: (IRISH ACCENT) And
I'll tell you something else.

00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:48.622
I hope Irish people
don't see it,

00:40:48.622 --> 00:40:50.080
because they might
think it stinks.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.240
DAVID WINDMUELLER: OK.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.573
AUDIENCE: I'll give you the
out, and answer this however

00:40:56.573 --> 00:40:58.867
you feel most comfortable.

00:40:58.867 --> 00:41:01.200
So when you talk about the
evolution of stand-up comedy,

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.510
especially political
commentary, like thinking back

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:10.390
to Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks,
where we are now, is it easier?

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:11.220
Is it harder?

00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:14.130
Is it just the exact
same situation?

00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:17.130
Are we in a different place?

00:41:17.130 --> 00:41:18.360
Have audiences evolved?

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.890
Have comedians evolved?

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:22.800
Or are we just stuck on a loop?

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.900
COLIN QUINN: From
those days, you mean?

00:41:24.900 --> 00:41:27.330
Yeah, I mean, this is going
to be another long-winded one.

00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.410
I'm just warning
you ahead of time.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.670
I can sense I'm going
to be rambling again.

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.204
But it's evolved.

00:41:34.204 --> 00:41:36.120
Here's how you know it's
going to be too long.

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:40.200
It's evolved and devolved
at the same time.

00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.380
I really am a big mouth.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:45.330
But it's evolved
in that people--

00:41:45.330 --> 00:41:47.160
like when I was doing
comedy in the '80s,

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.079
people would just get away
with murder, just cheap things.

00:41:50.079 --> 00:41:51.620
You'd be like, that's
not even funny.

00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.270
It's just the shock or
whatever of the audience.

00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.310
So now people are listening
more, which is good.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:01.900
But it's devolved in the
sense that everybody--

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.090
I feel like there's
almost like a film,

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:06.820
like a fake film
over everything.

00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:09.880
So when people speak,
it's almost like we

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:13.570
all agree like, OK,
you're saying this exists

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:15.140
that we know doesn't exist.

00:42:15.140 --> 00:42:17.602
And then the jokes will
come within this fake world

00:42:17.602 --> 00:42:18.185
we've created.

00:42:21.532 --> 00:42:22.990
It wasn't as long
as the other one.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:25.344
But it was just as
hard to figure out.

00:42:25.344 --> 00:42:26.760
I don't even know
what I'm saying.

00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:27.926
But do you know what I mean?

00:42:27.926 --> 00:42:30.560
I just feel like there's
something very fake going on,

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:32.885
and it's infected
stand-up, too, you know?

00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:35.199
Where people are like,
it should be appropriate.

00:42:35.199 --> 00:42:36.490
Stand-up should be appropriate.

00:42:36.490 --> 00:42:38.180
It's like, no, the
whole point of stand-up

00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.240
is it's not appropriate.

00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.880
It's kind of--

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.910
I mean, part of the
fun of a stand-up show

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.500
is you're like, oh, my god.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:46.220
Come on, man.

00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.640
That's too much.

00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.830
Do you know what I mean?

00:42:48.830 --> 00:42:51.170
And now it's sort of
like that too much

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:53.030
is based on something fake.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:55.530
So people are almost
forcing themselves.

00:42:55.530 --> 00:42:58.190
I'm single-handedly bringing
down the stand-up industry

00:42:58.190 --> 00:42:59.010
right now.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:00.335
You're going to go, I don't
want to go to a comedy club

00:43:00.335 --> 00:43:02.100
if it sucks as bad as he says.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.560
But I'm saying there's still
a lot of great stand-up

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.180
out there.

00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.971
Hey, there's still a
lot of great stand-up.

00:43:05.971 --> 00:43:07.670
But I mean, there's something.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.930
When it comes to
politics or whatever,

00:43:09.930 --> 00:43:14.800
there's just a general
feeling of appropriate that's

00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.580
not what stand-up is to me.

00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:17.415
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:43:17.415 --> 00:43:18.150
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.358
DAVID WINDMUELLER: All right.

00:43:19.358 --> 00:43:20.780
Well, thank you, Colin Quinn.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.160
"Red State Blue State."

00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:22.993
COLIN QUINN: Thanks.

00:43:22.993 --> 00:43:25.550
DAVID WINDMUELLER: Playing until
March 16 at the Minetta Lane

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.420
Theater.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.100
And we thank you
very much for coming.

00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:29.391
COLIN QUINN: Thank you so much.

00:43:29.391 --> 00:43:30.140
Thank you guys.

00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.990
Thank you.
