00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.580
"And now, let's turn to a young woman who has chosen to lend her voice...

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.840
...to this very important solidarity movement. She's a leading British actor, an advocate for gender equality in

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.200
her own right, she's been involved with the promotion of girls' education for several years. Ladies and gentlemen,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.520
please join me in welcoming to this stage our co-host and the UN women's global goodwill ambassador,

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.460
Emma Watson."

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.680
"Oh... Emma, don't worry about it. You look great."

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.640
"Ahahallo!"

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.320
"Mwah. Good morning."

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.380
"I'm Regis and she's Kelly, and welcome to our show."

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.980
"Jump up here, Emma; let's talk."

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.200
"This is Emma's first time in New York-- first time in America!"

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.500
"So what happened when you learned you got the part? That must've been the thrill of your life, right?"

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.240
- "Yeah... yeah, it was-- I couldn't believe it."
- "And what did the other kids say at school?"

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.400
"Why you? WHY YOU, EMMA WATSON?!"

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.440
Emma Watson is in her mid-20s.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.220
She's in the public eye because she's made some films,

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.300
but what she has to offer us is an example of positive character traits

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.940
that have nothing really to do with the cinema.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:20.520
We may benefit from having her example selectively in mind in relation to many apparently distant matters.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.360
First and foremost, Emma Watson is an example of the virtue of dignity.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.840
"... it's an honor to be joined by Malala Yousufzai. Hello Malala."

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.800
"Hello."

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.100
It's quite hard to pin down what we might mean by dignity.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.260
Probably everyone wants more of this quality, but it feels odd to say so.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.260
That's because we easily confuse dignity with a couple of other things that we tend to be very suspicious of:

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.160
coldness and standoffish pride.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.840
There's a worry that if someone has dignity, they're not going to be very nice to be around,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.940
but really dignity has to do with being confident of one's own decency and fundamental soundness...

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:04.320
... in situations where there's pressure to lose this confidence and act otherwise.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.760
When participating in a TV chat show, Emma mixes easily with people...

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:12.380
... who are at times rather clownish or crass.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.380
"I remember, um, being devastated coming into the studio and seeing another little girl who ah...

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.840
had actually been in films before, and I was like, 'Oh, I'm never, never gonna get it. She's had previous acting

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.460
experience, she's--
- "And that dang Judi Dench is a bitch."

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.060
"She can play young as well. You know she..."

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.240
But she doesn't become like them, and so she can be a good sport and join in without losing her natural honor.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:45.440
She's not cold, and hence is a good example to have in mind of how to pull off, without strain, a crucial everyday

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.100
diplomatic move: how to get on well with all sorts of people, and yet still be yourself.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.780
- "I don't quite understand what you're saying."
- "Well, I'll tell you what..."

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.220
We might tend to think that the great lessons we need to learn from others are complicated,

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.820
but a lesson is great because it's basic-- because we need it a lot, and so it will by definition

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.540
look quite simple when stated.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.300
"Ahh, other than just to say thank you so much for all of your support and..."

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.680
Emma is also good at gratitude.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.340
It would be understandable if a person got sick of being labeled just one thing-- Potter Girl--

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.960
and therefore turned against being in the limelight,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.020
becoming a bit hollow or mechanical in acknowledging the thing that had given them so much.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.300
But Emma Watson seems to be genuinely understanding of the role that she has to play for other people.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.060
She will always be, especially for younger girls, Hermione.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.620
She has to be Hermione just as Elizabeth Windsor has to be the queen for people,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.120
even if she has moments of inward frustration at having to be this character.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.360
In this way, Emma is like a good parent.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:55.060
She knows the character is bigger than her, just as being Mummy, someone loving, kind and understanding,

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.280
is more important than being recognized by your children for being the fuller, more complex,

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.560
more ambivalent person you really are.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.380
"How many journals and diaries do you have goin'?"

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.720
"I think I have 30."

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.840
Emma is good, too, at generosity.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.700
She's clever, but doesn't humiliate people with the fact.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.000
She doesn't go on chat shows and talk about post-structuralism or the early novels of George Eliot...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.220
... to her academics specialisms--

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.260
not because she couldn't do that very well, but because it would be unkind.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.020
In fact, her generosity is such that it seems strange even to note these possibilities.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.760
"I don't... I don't believe for a second that it's both of your birthday."

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.940
She beautifully evades, even a hint, that she might have loves and needs and insights...

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.780
... that would leave others bereft and feeling abandoned by their old friend from Hogwarts.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.500
"Promise you'll write in summer. Both of you."

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.820
In a similar way, Emma is casual in the way she dresses, where she shops and how she lives.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.380
What does it mean when she dresses down?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.340
Is she a strange kind of fake, a fake ordinary?

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.240
She could afford a chauffeur, she could have bodyguards, she could always look a million dollars.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.060
Is she just playing at being like us?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.460
More likely, she's making a point about how good it is to have an ordinary life.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:11.520
She wants something that we already have.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.860
In the Christian tradition, Jesus, the Son of God and the Prince of Heaven, becomes a man.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:23.720
He is born to very ordinary parents. He does all the ordinary things: he works, gets tired, feels lonely...

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.120
and this is imagined as the consequence of love.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.440
To love is to want to share in the ordinary existence of another person.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.820
Watson looks at people who are not glamorous, not famous, never invited onto the Red Carpet, and she says

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.940
implicitly, "I like how you do things."

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.820
That's very helpful indeed. It's important for us to have people in mind who have the option of opting out,

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.480
who don't have to live ordinary lives, but who actually freely choose everyday things.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.960
By so doing, these people teach us to appreciate a little more the things which we love less than we should.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:11.860
"I am inviting you to step forward, to be seen, and to ask yourself:

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:19.320
'If not me, who? If not now, when?'

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.640
Thank you very, very much."
