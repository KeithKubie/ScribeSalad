00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.650
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Hello everybody. Good evening.
Thanks for coming tonight. Welcome to Digital

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:13.780
Art at Google's Lecture Series. This is our
second show. We write this to you from the

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.949
distant future cospired, co-sponsored by the
Chelsea Art Museum.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.830
My name is Scott Draves and I'll be the MC
for tonight, and I'm standing in for Josh

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.870
Mittleman who's really the-the Google engineer
who initiated this project and unfortunately

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.010
he-he can't be here tonight and he sends his-his
regrets.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.629
But Google's mission is to organize the world's
information and make it accessible, and art

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.309
is one way of accessing or understanding information.

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.230
And so we thought since our office here is
in New York and-and in Chelsea and our-our

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:02.579
and because of our-our, we thought that it
would be great to get so, to reach out to

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.890
the art world and work together. And so that's
how and so Josh contacted Nina Colosi who

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.040
curated these shows and brought us the wonderful
artists who we're going to hear here tonight.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.380
So first we have James Tunick and later Jack
Toolin will be speaking.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.490
So James is an artist focused on the intersection
of creativity and technology in public spaces,

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.140
an entrepreneur, and software developer. He
lives and works in New York City where he

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.229
founded StudioIMC.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:48.140
His work has been featured at ARS Electronica,
the USF Contemporary Art Museum, Rolling Stone

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.110
Magazine, the Museum of Modern Art, the New
York Times, and many venues and-and media

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.450
outlets.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.770
He has two patents pending on software that
allows large audience participation with games,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.040
ads, and digital art on billboards and video
screens in Times Square, major league baseball

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.050
stadiums, and the like.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.720
Tunick co-founded Mapcidy, a social platform
that uses Google Earth and Web5design, a Web

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.770
development firm. He's been a very busy guy.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.390
Tunick received his B.A. from Yale University
and his Master's from the NYU Tisch Interactive

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.360
Telecommunications Program, ITP.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.910
So take it away James. Thank you very much.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.790
[applause]

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:42.239
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: [unintelligible] that introduction.

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.940
So first I wanna start with a little bit of
personal background and then talk a little

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.800
bit more about professional background.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm gonna skip through the-the bio that Scott
mostly just read and kind of try and boil

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.920
that down into a few key points.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.300
Who am I? I am yet an artist, a software developer,
and an entrepreneur. My focuses are really

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.030
at the intersection of art technology and
gaming in public spaces.

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:21.400
My work appears on the Web, mobile devices,
and also in public spaces on big screens.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.319
And the reasons I do these things and-and
the things that-that really drive me are my

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.610
passion and-and wanting to really encourage
creativity in public spaces, empowering people

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.100
to express themselves in public spaces, and
enhancing future cities using technology and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.580
art as a way to make our cities more livable.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.200
I feel very strongly and-and I'm really very
passionate about this-this idea that actually

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:00.290
has been around for-for some time since the
'60s and Rauschenberg's work and E.A.T., Experiments

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.769
in Art and Technology at the Armory here in
New York.

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.620
And really feel strongly that the intersection
of technology and art, especially in public

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.840
spaces, has the power to inspire a sense of
magic. It allows us to strengthen communication

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:24.500
in communities. It allows people to become
artists in public spaces. It puts the-the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.500
power into the hands of people in cities for
each to express themselves on the sides of

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.229
buildings and elsewhere. It has the power
to stimulate community collaboration in like

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:37.620
free speech and public discourse.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.620
Of course these are all idealistic ways of-of
looking at these things. I think that technology

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.830
in public spaces is a doubled-edged sword
and it can also be used for-for bad things.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:58.590
But we're starting to see new forms of storytelling,
new forms of gaming, technology and art that

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:03.540
provides easier access to information and
entertainment in public spaces. And increasingly

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.220
this is becoming known as the Outernet. In-in
the industry it's called Digital Out-of-Home

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:18.470
and usually refers to advertising, but my
focus is-is both in the arts, entertainment,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.810
as well as in advertising.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:28.340
So if you can imagine a-a city of the future
where the city becomes even more of a cultural

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.520
hub than it already is, where buildings become
canvases and cell phones become paint brushes;

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.260
where every person has the power to express
themselves on the side of a building or play

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.630
a large audience game.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.919
I'm gonna walk through some of my early art
works. I'm gonna try and actually go through

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.830
the presentation rather quickly so that I
can show videos and live demos of some of

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.000
these art works.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:01.069
One of the first works that I consider important
is a 9/11 memorial sculpture called "WHY"

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:10.569
that I built at Yale University. It was essentially
two planks of wood, a bunch of magic markers,

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:18.069
and a plaque that asks people to express themselves
and-and answer the question, "Why?" in regards

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:19.720
to 9/11.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.979
And within days it was absolutely covered
in writing and diagrams and people discussing

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:33.180
the topic with each other, comments connected
with lines and drawings and pictures, and

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:41.090
I mean everything under the sun in terms of
opinions and-and the ways that people are

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.840
expressing themselves about these-these sad
events.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:50.970
From there at ITP, the Interactive Telecommunications
Program at NYU, I began to think more about

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:57.580
free speech in public spaces and-and how to
leverage technology as a way to allow people

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.380
to-to express themselves more easily.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:06.770
Traded a work called The Free Speech Bulletin
which was fairly basic installation that allowed

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:13.610
people to send text messages to a mobile projection.
So there was a boat battery, there was a screen

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:18.250
on wheels, we would project on buildings or
on the screen on wheels, and allowed people

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:26.030
to answer questions about politics, local
community, and essentially allowed people

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.870
to express themselves and-and their opinions.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.479
From there I created a-a work with another
artist named Miro Kirov, who was a classmate

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:43.280
at ITP. This is a work called "Infinite City,"
where using gesture people can fly through

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:48.060
a 3D cityscape and also compose music in real
time. So it was a multi-user, immersive environment

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:53.300
that allowed people to express themselves
through music and kind of fly through this

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.300
futuristic cityscape.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:08:00.710
You'll see there are some common themes in
terms of this idea of the future city and

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:05.620
I'll talk a little bit more specifically about
City of the Future which is the-the work outside

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.449
that I've got installed with my wife, Carrie
Elston Tunick and another colleague, Josh

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:14.080
Schiller.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:19.509
Next early work is-is a piece of technology
called the "Media Bandit" and you'll see that

00:08:19.509 --> 00:08:25.940
a lot of my work kinda bridges commercial
and art world. I consider on the art side

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:33.120
this is a type of kind of media pop art. At
the same time many of the art works that-that

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:38.279
I've created with-with colleagues and others
at StudioIMC have been used commercially by

00:08:38.279 --> 00:08:40.409
clients like Heineken and others.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:47.380
So this was essentially a portable VJ station
that people could take out to events. Started

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:54.370
actually my career in-in doing live video
mixing and VJ work in night clubs and restaurants

00:08:54.370 --> 00:09:01.180
as-as a teenager and so became very interested
in this idea of kind of putting the audience

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.920
into the visuals at these events and essentially
created a piece of software that allowed live

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.570
video mixing, live video to be mixed in with
some of the logos.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:16.681
This is another early work called "Cell Sketch"
and I'll demo this a little bit later as well.

00:09:16.681 --> 00:09:23.029
This is a work that allows people to sketch
with the light from their cell phone. So standing

00:09:23.029 --> 00:09:29.830
in front of the screen you can draw a smiley
face, you can spell your name, and essentially

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:35.850
the-the phone becomes a paint brush. It also
generates sound when you move your phone and

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:43.480
so there's this kind of connection between
you and-and the screen both visually and in

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:44.570
terms of the music.

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.850
Another early work that's related to "Infinite
City," this is a work called "Collaborative

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:55.190
Immersive Networked Environment" or CINE.
This was another immersive environment that,

00:09:55.190 --> 00:10:02.690
it was kind of a vision of-of future cities
that allowed people to send pictures from

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:09.899
city streets and then those pictures would
show up in a 3D city and it was a multi-user

00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:13.970
environment; multiple people could control
it and-and fly through the space. I'll show

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:20.050
a video of this as well later on. And then
the pictures could actually be posted as billboards

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.392
on any of the virtual buildings.

00:10:21.392 --> 00:10:27.360
The idea was kind of this mixture of virtual
and real and also, so it was part of my research

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:34.010
at-at ITP and kinda getting towards this idea
of the multi-user computer interface environment.

00:10:34.010 --> 00:10:39.839
The mouse and keyboard is-is rather restrictive
when it comes to navigating the Web, making

00:10:39.839 --> 00:10:46.160
music, and so this was really an attempt at
kind of experimenting with a multi-user interface,

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:51.230
putting the computer into the space, tracking
hand movement and body movement, and allowing

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.540
people to fly through this 3D city.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:59.980
I just mention this-this work briefly. This
is a-a white paper and-and actually a paper

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:08.930
that was selected as a finalist in a design
competition at Data Play Social Evolutions

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:15.610
Conference and really was kind of the first
time that I began to think about this idea

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:21.160
of blending cell phone displays and social
software in-in public spaces. This idea has

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:29.320
evolved some since, but really convinced that
we're gonna see the Internet evolve into the

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320
Outernet.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:38.200
There will be in public spaces a merging of
mobile devices, big screens, media facades,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:44.380
and architecture, as well as the Web. Social
talk where as-as we know it today is-is still

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:50.660
fairly basic and I think that in the future
we will see in public spaces how these can

00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:52.330
add up and become more than the sum of their
parts.

00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:58.630
Another early work that I built with my wife
and-and another colleague, Aaron Schiller.

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:06.920
This is called "Park of the Future." This
was featured in the L.A. Times and really

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:13.730
is kind of the first inkling of-of the next
work I'll talk about [unintelligible.

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:14.730
[pause]

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:21.769
The work is-is really a-a concept that ties
into many of the things I've already mentioned:

00:12:21.769 --> 00:12:29.040
media facades, reskinable buildings, promoting
free speech through text messaging, picture

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:37.029
messaging and really trying to encourage public
discourse in neighborhoods and city parks.

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:38.490
[pause]

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:45.079
This is a more recent work. This is a stereoscopic
3D environment called "Parallel Cityscapes"

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:51.490
that was at the USF Contemporary Art Museum.
You would put on stereo glasses which you

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:56.720
now see in-in a lot of movie theaters, similar
type of 3D where it pops out of the screen.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.110
And this was actually the first time that
I showed what's called the IMC-Space which

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:11.630
I'll talk about a little bit later on. Essentially
a 3D visualization of YouTube videos and other

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:17.149
data feeds where the user can fly through
an immersive space and kind of see the universe

00:13:17.149 --> 00:13:23.269
of data related to certain YouTube users or
other large data sets.

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:30.150
Another recent work called "Circuit." This
is a video art work that was shown by Nina

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:36.940
and-and Streaming Museum on billboards around
the world. Another information, visualization,

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:41.490
3D space that takes Twitter feeds and puts
them into a 3D environment that you can fly

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.959
through.

00:13:42.959 --> 00:13:46.760
And this is the work that's on display at
ARS Electronica right now and-and here in

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:52.240
the lobby at-at Google. And actually this
will probably be better explained by the video

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:55.790
later on so I'm going to continue to kind
of push through the presentation here and

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.850
go into more detail in a bit.

00:13:59.850 --> 00:14:03.800
So those are kind of my personal artworks.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:12.199
I also as-as Scott mentioned founded a-a company
out of college called StudioIMC. We are essentially

00:14:12.199 --> 00:14:19.660
a collective of programmers and artists. We
do work both commercially and in the arts.

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:26.800
All of our programmers are also artists and
we represent them in that we put them into

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:33.459
art shows at museums and galleries and curate
these shows at-at museums and galleries.

00:14:33.459 --> 00:14:40.339
So this is one of the first shows that we
did called "Convergence" which was about the

00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:43.709
mixture of virtual and real.

00:14:43.709 --> 00:14:47.899
Another StudioIMC art show, a three month
show at the Museum of TV and Radio which is

00:14:47.899 --> 00:14:53.440
now called the-the Paley Center for Media,
which was trying to imagine future forms of

00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:00.660
entertainment. It was called "Beyond TV" and-and
it was again focused on media artists from

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:01.850
StudioIMC.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:09.529
Second IMC exposition. This is a trade show
and art show that StudioIMC puts on about

00:15:09.529 --> 00:15:15.000
every two years. It started out as an annual
show, but became a larger production than-than

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.080
expected and this is the second expo which
involved holographic light sculptures, interactive

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:29.130
installations, and a variety of other types
of works.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.740
This is the more recent IMC exposition. I
think the catalogues may have been passed

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:39.550
around and will give you kind of a, I think
a good idea of how we bridge the art world

00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:45.290
and-and the commercial world, big screens
and public spaces. We were lucky enough to

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:48.650
have Daktronics as a partner, Streaming Musueum
as a partner.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:54.600
Daktronics is the-the largest maker of billboards
in the world and they're in baseball stadiums.

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:59.790
And in addition we also showed many of the
works by StudioIMC artists, emerging artists

00:15:59.790 --> 00:16:07.850
from ITP, and all of them with a focus on
promoting collaboration, public spaces, allowing

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:13.360
people to participate in the artworks either
through phone, through gesture, through voice

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:14.360
control.

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:23.269
So this leads into some of my more commercial
work, but I think that-that-the two are really

00:16:23.269 --> 00:16:24.269
interjoined.

00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:31.509
StudioIMC is-is a new media lab here in New
York City. We build software for the Outernet

00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:37.680
producing games and-and art and interactive
ads for big screens in public spaces.

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:46.260
As I mentioned before we also represent an
international team, whoops, sorry 'bout that.

00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:47.260
[unintelligible]

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:48.269
[pause]

00:16:48.269 --> 00:16:53.190
We also represent an international team of
artists and programmers, many of them from

00:16:53.190 --> 00:16:59.339
ITP, some of them colleagues from Yale, others
met over the years in-in Europe and in Asia,

00:16:59.339 --> 00:17:04.240
and we show their work again in-in museums
and at the StudioIMC lab and gallery here

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.370
in New York.

00:17:05.370 --> 00:17:11.410
Our approach is to develop creative software
tools that inspire a sense of magic and invite

00:17:11.410 --> 00:17:15.789
collaboration in public spaces through interactivity,
engagement, and measurement.

00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:17.670
Short list of-of some of our clients.

00:17:17.670 --> 00:17:26.549
We produce three technologies for big screens.
Again can push digital art, they can push

00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:35.350
ads, new types of entertainment and gaming
to big screens and to phones.

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.570
Two of the software platforms have patents
pending.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:40.490
The software powers the world's first network
of interactive movie screens. So before the

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:45.770
movies start people can pull out their phones
or wave at the screen to play a game or interact

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.770
in some way.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:55.160
In stadiums, at concerts, on video walls and
building lobbies and the platform is really

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:59.919
I think all of this kind of ties back to our
early work in-in video art, VJing and-and

00:17:59.919 --> 00:18:02.710
pushing digital art in public spaces.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:08.750
This is a platform that works on screens of
any size and it allows people to interact

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:12.710
through one of three ways. And first way is
through cell phone interaction, so it's either

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:19.270
through texting or sending pictures or actually
calling into a number and then the phone becomes

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:22.559
a joy stick for the screen and you can have
hundreds or even thousands of people playing

00:18:22.559 --> 00:18:23.780
at once.

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:30.970
Gesture interaction. So we, part of my background
at-at Yale and ITP was in computer vision

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:37.520
and-and face tracking and so we allow audience
members to essentially play the game or-or

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.590
interact with the artwork using hand gestures,
using face movement, body movement. And then

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.820
voice interaction is the third type of interactivity.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:52.880
These can be blended, "City of the Future"
out in the lobby actually uses both cell phone

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:56.110
interaction and gesture interaction.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:02.410
The platform works with multiple modules,
multiple pieces of interactive content. Essentially

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:08.380
we have about a hundred of these modules.
Some of them are digital artworks, some of

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.120
them are advertisements, some of them are
games.

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:18.920
And this is the software being used in-in
Times Square currently by Sony and-and News

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.799
Corp at One Times Square where people can
send votes and it shows up on the screen in-in

00:19:23.799 --> 00:19:24.799
real time.

00:19:24.799 --> 00:19:33.460
Houston Astros are using the software to allow
fans to send pictures of their kids up to

00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:39.200
the screen, send chat messages, and also to
vote for their favorite players.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.870
Dallas Mavericks have been using it for similar
purposes.

00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:47.870
These are two large audience games in movie
theaters that we built recently. One is for

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:52.740
Sprint and the one in the upper left is for
Benihana Restaurants.

00:19:52.740 --> 00:20:00.179
The Benihana game -- the audience could put
their hands up and essentially help a chef

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:04.850
catch shrimp in his hat. So moving left and
right, the hat would move left and right with

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:09.180
the audience and basically a large audience
game. People are jumping out of their seats

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:14.150
and screaming and yelling and trying to take
control of the chef's hat.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:18.500
The game on the right you would call into
a phone number, hundreds of people can play

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:23.081
at once, you hop out of a limo, you dodge
paparazzi, and you make your way to the movie

00:20:23.081 --> 00:20:25.669
premier.

00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:29.289
More basic types of interactivity in movie
theaters with voting.

00:20:29.289 --> 00:20:33.440
Some big audience games for film studios.

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:38.170
I'll kind of zip through some of the rest
of this so we have time for some of the videos

00:20:38.170 --> 00:20:40.240
and-and live demos.

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:44.970
This a technology I mentioned earlier where
the phone actually becomes a game controller.

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.150
This is for Diageo.

00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:53.870
Heineken augmented reality; this is something
called "Magic Mirror" that was on display

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:56.340
at the Time Warner Center.

00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:02.400
IMCtv's been used for digital art at the IAC
Building. They claim to have the largest HD

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:07.710
video wall in the world. I think it's over
120 feet long and we created three custom

00:21:07.710 --> 00:21:10.070
modules for those screens.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:12.520
Video walls for the Nets in Times Square.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.860
Immersive environments for National Amusements
where there was digital art and movie trailers

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.600
on all the screens.

00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.900
We've also done some R &amp; D with artificially
intelligent characters and-and holograms that

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.311
will respond to speech and movement.

00:21:27.311 --> 00:21:31.280
Skip through some of this.

00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.669
This is our mobile platform.

00:21:34.669 --> 00:21:40.559
We've also developed a technology that allows
both in-in the arts and commercially signage

00:21:40.559 --> 00:21:46.120
owners and building owners to track how many
people have looked at the display. It doesn't

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:50.610
know who you are, doesn't record video. Think
of this as click tracking for public spaces.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.610
[pause]

00:21:52.610 --> 00:22:01.340
This is the final piece of technology I'm-I-m
gonna talk about before heading into the videos.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:06.770
This is a piece of technology called "IMCspace"
which is essentially a visualization of large

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:11.659
data sets; so whether it plugs into YouTube
or Flicker.

00:22:11.659 --> 00:22:17.950
What it does is that it provides a bird's
eye view of large data sets. So the taller

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:23.630
the buildings, the more views the YouTube
video has gotten.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:30.380
Clusters are users and the clusters next to
them are their friends. So if you're looking

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:36.280
for a very specific video, of course you can
use standard Google search and it sends you

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.000
directly to the video.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.039
If you wanna see the universe of videos around
the user and get an idea of kind of the bird's

00:22:44.039 --> 00:22:50.929
eye view of that data set, this is essentially
a way of-of doing so. So this is a fly through

00:22:50.929 --> 00:22:59.111
3D space that has been in artworks and-and
we have not used it commercially in any way,

00:22:59.111 --> 00:23:06.851
but our hope is that this is potentially a
way of visualizing large data sets on the

00:23:06.851 --> 00:23:10.330
Web in the future.

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:17.320
So I really feel very strongly that with the
video game generation growing up and with

00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:25.750
people living in a 3D environment, that the
Web will soon become an immersive 3D space

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:30.650
that you can fly through. There will still
be a use for the flat page for reading, for

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:37.620
searching for a single thing, but the-the
magic, the-the immersive experience of flying

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:41.340
through a large data set I think is-is bound
to take over.

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:45.640
Of course there have since the '70s and '80s
been people talking about virtual reality

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:51.340
and the hopes for 3D and it's kind of flopped
and flopped time and time again.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:58.590
But I think that inevitably the fact that
we think in 3D, that our memory's, our memory's

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:03.950
actually much stronger in-in terms of a spatial
memory. You think about how many items can

00:24:03.950 --> 00:24:12.180
you remember in your home folder on your computer?
Maybe five, maybe ten. How many items can

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:19.150
you remember in your home? The soap dish,
the clock, the lamp on the bedside table.

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:26.350
Your spatial memory is much stronger than
trying to remember a list or-or a bunch of

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:31.890
names. So I think that's fairly inevitable
at-at some point.

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:36.470
My hope is that the computer of the future
will not be this tiny thing that one person

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:41.500
sits in front of, but it becomes an environment
and of course the "City of the Future" is

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:47.090
a place where people can play games, paint
on the side of buildings, and-and the like.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:55.169
So I'm going to quickly show a video of the
"City of the Future" which is the artwork

00:24:55.169 --> 00:25:27.420
out here in-in the lobby. I'm gonna skip I
think some of the others.

00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.470
[pause]

00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.570
[clicking sound]

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:31.620
[pause]

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:35.810
[techno playing in background]

00:25:35.810 --> 00:25:47.350
&gt;&gt;Narrator: City of the Future. Concept. Free
speech in the environment.

00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:57.309
Imagine a new type of ubiquitous communication
medium that builds community and encourages

00:25:57.309 --> 00:26:03.680
creativity by making culture visible in public
spaces.

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:14.660
Envision a city that is constantly interacting
with and aware of its natural environment.

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:25.150
Buildings and networked objects built with
green materials display key info about their

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:34.020
surroundings, such as local pollution levels,
energy consumption, or recycling habits.

00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:46.130
One day we will see each other and see our
environment in brand new ways.

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:59.610
It is our hope to create a model showing that
cities one day become smart spaces and large

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:07.679
scale augmented environments with embedded
technologies that promote free speech, green

00:27:07.679 --> 00:27:10.679
thinking, and creative innovation.

00:27:10.679 --> 00:27:18.789
Cities will be more transparent and democratic;
buildings and parks filling with people's

00:27:18.789 --> 00:27:20.649
ideas and artworks.

00:27:20.649 --> 00:27:30.020
Our method is to offer an open source model
or open blueprint for future urban architecture

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:37.710
in public spaces that combine green architecture,
smart spaces, ambient displays, immersive

00:27:37.710 --> 00:27:41.559
environments, mobile devices, and networked
objects.

00:27:41.559 --> 00:27:49.890
Our goal is to encourage free speech, community
innovation, and sustainability for future

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:50.890
generations.

00:27:50.890 --> 00:28:01.770
Phase one of the project consists of responsive
architecture in outdoor immersive environments.

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:22.210
Such environments and architecture act actually
as we use is types of skins. Think of it as

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:24.330
a replaceable desktop.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:42.350
Each building would have its own look and
feel that could change day to day: one moment

00:28:42.350 --> 00:29:03.110
a-an ocean landscape, in another moment a
rain forest. Projections on the sides of the

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:23.669
buildings means that the architecture becomes
totally malleable. In a way it can be totally

00:29:23.669 --> 00:29:36.440
changeable: changing the sense of space.

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:43.740
The second phase of the project is about community
collaboration where we would use ambient architectural

00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.159
displays location specific environment data.

00:29:46.159 --> 00:29:54.210
For example, the environmental light sculpture
actually shows how bad global warming has

00:29:54.210 --> 00:30:04.809
gotten. So this can be a monument in the middle
of a city, a large sculpture in a city park,

00:30:04.809 --> 00:30:06.980
and powered by solar panels.

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:11.740
In addition, there are also location specific
environmental data displays on buildings that

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.090
show local energy consumption levels and recycling.

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:22.419
Another type of light sculpture using wireless
technologies might be a pollution meter showing

00:30:22.419 --> 00:30:36.549
people how bad pollution is
in a certain part of the city.

00:30:36.549 --> 00:30:50.830
The third part of the project is creative
culture and using free speech spaces and community

00:30:50.830 --> 00:31:03.720
bulletin boards people would be encouraged
to create and-and participate in local politics,

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:16.600
play big games, see tourist maps, participate
in culture and entertainment, send comments

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:28.500
to bulletins in-in parks, trading videos,
sending text messages about local issues.

00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:37.230
And the fact is this can be something outdoors,
this can be something indoors, like the media

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:43.779
immersion room seen here, where people essentially
are-are able to use the space as-as a place

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:46.730
for collaboration, as a place for free expression.

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:51.890
As a whole, using smart architecture and wireless
technologies, it's our hope to offer this

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:55.610
open source model that will actually build
stronger communities.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:59.840
The city will come alive. At one moment a
rain forest, the next moment teeming with

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:05.490
user generated videos, and comments and cell
phones on issues like the status of the local

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:06.530
school system.

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:12.500
The city will be an open candidate for expression,
responding to our every need and allowing

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.320
urban dwellers to communicate on a higher
level.

00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:21.870
Such an urban society would not only be more
beautiful but would also promote creativity,

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:26.630
justice, accountability, and a closer, more
transparent community.

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:29.490
[techno music playing]

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:42.870
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: You'll have to excuse the
poor sound and-and rough graphics. This video's

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:57.190
actually about three or four years old at
this point. And I think that that's probably

00:32:57.190 --> 00:33:02.360
about all the time I-I have here.

00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:07.809
I wanted to show one last item if I have 10
seconds.

00:33:07.809 --> 00:33:08.809
&gt;&gt;Scott: Sure.

00:33:08.809 --> 00:33:14.200
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: This is actually the artwork
that's on display out-out front and actually

00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.100
I'll turn the video tracking on.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:26.490
This is pulling YouTube videos live from the
Web and again the taller the video the more

00:33:26.490 --> 00:33:29.870
views it's gotten.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:45.590
Each cluster is a user so this is [lonelygirl15]
and her friends. And again the idea is that

00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:52.440
you can kind of get an idea of the universe
of-of videos around this user and her friends.

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:59.690
I'm able to navigate the space using the light
from my phone. This is true on the installation

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:00.690
outside.

00:34:00.690 --> 00:34:22.510
And anyway this is an example of-of the types
of-of work that I'm doing and is being done

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:29.619
by other artists at StudioIMC.

00:34:29.619 --> 00:34:41.089
And that said if you'd like to see the presentation,
other demos, a lot of this'll be available

00:34:41.089 --> 00:34:42.089
at studioimc.com/google.

00:34:42.089 --> 00:34:43.089
[pause]

00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:44.589
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Thank you very much.

00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:46.520
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: Thank you.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:47.520
[applause]

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.179
Scott Draves: We have a couple minutes for
questions if-if anybody has something they

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:54.599
wanna ask James.

00:34:54.599 --> 00:34:55.599
[pause]

00:34:55.599 --> 00:34:59.250
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible] to the
readability and accessibility [unintelligible]

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.420
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: Um-hum.

00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:01.980
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.099
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Please repeat the question
so that --

00:35:05.099 --> 00:35:06.270
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: Yeah.

00:35:06.270 --> 00:35:08.220
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: for the recording.

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:13.700
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: So the question was: have
I thought about readability and accessibility

00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:19.970
in terms of putting large data sets in-in
public spaces, correct?

00:35:19.970 --> 00:35:22.119
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yes.

00:35:22.119 --> 00:35:28.240
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: So text in a 3D space is a
particular challenge. People are used to looking

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:35.590
for labels and tags when it comes to, especially
user generated content. I think, however,

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:46.730
that the ability first of all to zoom in and
see some of this text and also to be able

00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:52.160
to, from the bird's eye view, get visual cues
about the information without the use of text,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.670
allows the information potentially to be more
accessible.

00:35:53.670 --> 00:36:00.990
So from pulling back and-and kind of once
you understand of course there's a key for-for

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:11.460
many of these visualizations that'll tell
you x axis is the user, the y axis is the

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:17.100
number of views that the video has gotten,
the z axis is another parameter, that once

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:23.900
people understand that key information will
become more accessible.

00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:34.300
Also if there are visual cues as to what things
mean it can be more intuitive. I think Brad

00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:42.280
W. Paley spoke a little bit about that in-in
his talk in terms of using iconic imagery

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:45.670
and-and visual cues that allow you to kind
of immediately understand what the information

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:46.670
visualization means.

00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:50.450
Scott Draves: We have time for one more question.

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:55.620
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yes, you made a couple
of references to holograms --

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:57.360
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: Um-hum.

00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:03.730
&gt;&gt;male in audience: is that literally true,
I mean did, are you literally producing holograms?

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:08.810
&gt;&gt;James Tunick: There are a couple different
types of holographic display technologies

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:15.150
that we've been working with. Most of our
focus is on the software side.

00:37:15.150 --> 00:37:22.440
But we work with artists that build LED structures,
sculptures that will have volumetric imagines

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:30.780
floating inside of them so you can't pass
your hand through it, but it is volumetric

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:32.430
holographic image.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:37.810
We've also worked with a variety of different
semi-transparent materials that you can project

00:37:37.810 --> 00:37:42.540
through from multiple angles and create a
holographic effect as well.

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:43.540
[pause]

00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:45.540
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Thank you very much.

00:37:45.540 --> 00:37:48.970
And now we'll have Jack Toolin.

00:37:48.970 --> 00:37:49.970
[pause]

00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:55.231
So Jack is an interdisciplinary artist whose
work spans photography, performance art, and

00:37:55.231 --> 00:37:56.231
new media.

00:37:56.231 --> 00:38:00.010
His work has been exhibited nationally and
internationally at venues such as the Whitney

00:38:00.010 --> 00:38:08.150
Musuem of American Art, the San Jose Museum
of Art, the Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.560
Buenos, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and ARS
Electronica in Linz, Austria.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:19.320
He is visiting assistant professor at Pratt
Institute, an adjunct professor at Polytechnic

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.359
Institute at NYU.

00:38:21.359 --> 00:38:23.380
Are you ready to go?

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.380
[pause]

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:25.380
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yes.

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:26.710
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Okay.

00:38:26.710 --> 00:38:27.710
[pause]

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:29.089
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Is it on?

00:38:29.089 --> 00:38:30.170
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Yeah.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:31.610
[sound of microphone scraping]

00:38:31.610 --> 00:38:32.690
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Thanks.

00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:33.770
Okay, thanks Chris.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:34.770
[pause]

00:38:34.770 --> 00:38:35.770
Okay.

00:38:35.770 --> 00:38:36.770
Great.

00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:39.900
Thanks for coming. Thanks for being here.
Thanks to Nina for-for putting this together

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:45.599
and thanks to Google, Scott and Andrew for
inviting me to talk.

00:38:45.599 --> 00:38:50.339
So I'm gonna focus on a project that is a
complex project and multi-dimensional, but

00:38:50.339 --> 00:39:00.520
I do wanna give you a little bit of background
about myself and where the project comes from.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:08.500
My name is Jack and for 10 years I was a collaborator
in a group called C5 and we were based in

00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:14.460
Silicon Valley. We got together in '97 and
collaborated 'til 2007 working on a range

00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:19.910
of projects, but they were all about technology,
culture, art, and theory.

00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:29.359
And as you can see in my little blurb up there,
our motto was: "Theory as Product." So the

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:37.630
projects that we would work on were largely
driven by reading and thinking we were doing

00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:41.130
regarding technology and its effect on culture.

00:39:41.130 --> 00:39:42.960
This list of people are my collaborators there
for this project that I'm going to focus on.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:45.630
It's called the "Landscape Initiative."

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:57.869
But to give you just a little bit of background
on the group and where we were coming from.

00:39:57.869 --> 00:40:01.890
As I said we got together in '97 and being
in the Silicon Valley we were kind of caught

00:40:01.890 --> 00:40:09.011
up in the whole dot com rush and producing
work that was really screen-based early on

00:40:09.011 --> 00:40:10.011
doing data visualization work like the image
that you see at the –

00:40:10.011 --> 00:40:11.011
[sound of drill running]

00:40:11.011 --> 00:40:17.460
top there is actually of a page of linkable
colors that take you to hosted Websites in

00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:25.740
the database that we accumulated with a crawler
that would go out and ping potential URL's

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.770
and record URL's that were hosted.

00:40:28.770 --> 00:40:36.240
It was an alternate way of surfing the Web
in a sense and because of the way the-the

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:44.200
octets or the IP addresses are arranged on
the screen, it in a sense gave you a portrait

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.290
of Web space.

00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:53.480
And I can tell more about that piece or anything
I'm talking about, I'm just kind of skimming

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.430
through this just to give you a background.

00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.830
So this is a-a screen-based piece, it's so
called net-art.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:05.829
The piece over on the right with the green
that was a piece of software that we wrote

00:41:05.829 --> 00:41:13.341
that you could download to your computer and
it would scan your hard drive and kind of

00:41:13.341 --> 00:41:17.869
examine the way you work with information:
how many folders you create; how many folders

00:41:17.869 --> 00:41:25.619
within folders you make; and what the size
of the documents are within those folders.

00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:34.520
It wouldn't tell you anything more specific
than that but that information alone can tell

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:40.980
a lot about the way a person works with information
and what kinds of information you're working

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:47.420
with. The size of the document can relate
to a text file or image kind of file.

00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:57.650
The image on the bottom there is you don't
see that you don't see and it stands out because

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:04.940
it's an actual full on theater piece that
was about artificial intelligence. We wrote

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:08.849
a play and performed a play that was about
Alan Turing and John Sorel's debate about

00:42:08.849 --> 00:42:09.849
artificial intelligence.

00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:14.310
So we-we really ran a wide gamut of work from
screen based work to performance based work.

00:42:14.310 --> 00:42:20.780
And the group of people that was listed prior,
and that group expanded and contracted with

00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:27.330
other members and whatnot, and we came from
a range of backgrounds and a range of interests

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:32.760
and from programming to performance art and-and
whatnot. So we were all applying our skills

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.940
to do this, our projects over time.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.170
So anyway the piece I'm going to focus on
is the "C5 Landscape Initiative" which was

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:43.400
a piece that we started thinking about in
2002 and it was really based on the notion

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:49.640
of doing expeditions and using GPS technology
to generate data and apply that data for different

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:50.640
purposes.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:55.829
So the-the four projects that came out of
that are "The Analogous Landscape," "The Other

00:42:55.829 --> 00:43:02.619
Path," "Perfect View," and "The C5 GPS Media
Player." They look like this. They don't look

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:03.619
like that.

00:43:03.619 --> 00:43:04.619
[laughter]

00:43:04.619 --> 00:43:10.920
So but if you are interested in reading these
are some people, good, they're worthwhile

00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:17.170
checking out. Denis Cosgrove writes about
our perception of landscape and how that's

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:24.200
affected by culture. And Kevin Lynch is a
famous person talking about Cognitive Mapping

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:32.550
in the-the '50s. That's a famous book touchstone
for anybody thinking about urban mapping and

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:35.250
whatnot; The Image of the City.

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:39.150
Mitchell is a current writer talking about
network technologies and our experience of

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:40.150
space.

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:45.260
And Vi-Fu Tuan has been writing for decades
now about the-the nature of space and how

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:52.790
does it become place. They're more philosophical
texts, kind of interesting reading there.

00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:56.120
So but here are what the projects look like,
right?

00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.050
Here is "The Analogous Landscape," okay? And
where "The Analogous Landscape,"

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:02.099
[person sneezing]

00:44:02.099 --> 00:44:07.369
as I say here predicted modeling based upon
analogous expeditions.

00:44:07.369 --> 00:44:16.260
Our idea was that if we hiked some number
of mountains in the Ring of Fire around the

00:44:16.260 --> 00:44:23.530
Pacific Rim, which were all volcanic mountains
and by that fact they have somewhat similar

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:32.230
topological features. If we hike those mountains
and record our hikes and take that data set

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:40.329
from say five mountains, can we predict how
to hike the sixth mountain? And that was our

00:44:40.329 --> 00:44:41.329
starting notion.

00:44:41.329 --> 00:44:46.260
And we first hiked Mt. Shasta which is in
Northern California about five hours north

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:52.690
of San Francisco. So we spent a weekend hiking
through the snow using crampons and the whole

00:44:52.690 --> 00:45:01.660
bit because it's much safer, believe it or
not, to hike in the snow than it is in dry

00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:02.660
rocks.

00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.910
And-and along the way we were taking surveys.
We each had a Palm Pilot, the fancy technology

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:10.500
of the day, and on the Palm Pilot it had a
survey asking us what was our impression of

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.950
the landscape? How did we feel about, physically
feel about the hike so far? Had we seen anything

00:45:15.950 --> 00:45:19.430
sublime yet? These kinds of questions.

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:33.121
And we would take the survey every half hour
and kind of that would kind of be a way of

00:45:33.121 --> 00:45:41.620
estimating our progress or how we felt through
the hike and potentially after you get over

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.440
10,000 feet you become a different person.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440
[laughter]

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.290
So the survey- the survey would transform
a little bit, but.

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:51.540
And then secondly, geography does tap back
into – Guy Debord -- if anybody's read Guy

00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:55.880
Debord and he was kinda thinking more about
urban situations but we're applying it to

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:56.970
a more natural situation.

00:45:56.970 --> 00:46:04.000
And just to bump back this is when we achieved,
we-we conquered the summit so that's us sitting

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:11.110
up there. And the-the picture down there in
the right is a, is a digital reproduction

00:46:11.110 --> 00:46:20.640
of Shasta using USGS data fed into a CNC machine
and making a little phone reproduction of

00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:21.640
the mountain.

00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:26.270
So in the exhibition the pieces look like
this. We have -- Shasta is on the right and

00:46:26.270 --> 00:46:38.569
Fuji is on the left. So we got two mountains
conquered. Our goal was to go and go and go,

00:46:38.569 --> 00:46:43.500
but you know the funding sources were like,
"Sure, right." [laughs] "Great idea."

00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:50.200
It's a great idea and-and the-the piece functions
well in a gallery to get the concept across

00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:53.880
and that's mostly what we were concerned with.

00:46:53.880 --> 00:47:01.790
So what we've got are three foot by three
foot aluminum reproductions of the two mountains

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:10.520
that we did hike, Shasta and Fuji. And then
behind that are CGI models of the two mountains

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:16.740
rendered again from USGS data and the Japanese
equivalent of that.

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:24.530
And that is a video in the background that
has the mountain slowly rotating and with

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:32.610
a little red line showing how the, how we
hiked the mountains. And it kind of dissolves

00:47:32.610 --> 00:47:40.710
between the two. Therefore you get to compare
the similarity or dissimilarity of the two

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:41.710
hikes.

00:47:41.710 --> 00:47:54.609
So the goal was to have five of these or six
or ten. And it really would have been beautiful

00:47:54.609 --> 00:48:01.819
to have a nice array of mountains, but because
of who we were which was very kind of ADD,

00:48:01.819 --> 00:48:12.050
we gotta get the next project done and we
didn't have a lot of money, it was very expensive

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:21.339
to do what we did, we got that done and we're
pretty happy with that.

00:48:21.339 --> 00:48:30.119
So an-another project within "The Landscape
Initiative" was "The Other Path." And in "The

00:48:30.119 --> 00:48:46.270
Other Path" we're interested in taking a
data set and using that data set to see if

00:48:46.270 --> 00:48:53.619
we could find similar topographies in the
world that would trigger similar psychological

00:48:53.619 --> 00:48:59.680
experiences; in other words, a kind of a déjà
vu experience.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:11.770
So one of our members went to China and traveled
the length of the Great Wall and used a GPS

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:18.900
device as they did so, and came back with
that data set. It was very heavy. [laughs]

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:27.470
So he had this big data set and we used that
to look for a similar location topographically,

00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:33.839
topologically speaking in California, with
the notion that potentially we could find

00:49:33.839 --> 00:49:40.520
a similar topography and therefore kind of
experience the Great Wall all over again.

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:47.690
And just in terms of computational interest
it presents a large data mining problem looking

00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:56.340
at this big set of data and trying to find
similar qualities in this other set.

00:49:56.340 --> 00:50:08.400
And in fact one of our group members is a
professor at UC San Diego so we had access

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:14.700
to some powerful computing, but it was still
a very insurmountable problem.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:23.809
So we had to really, really reduce down what
we were looking for to looking at square kilometers

00:50:23.809 --> 00:50:30.760
and measuring the low point and the high point,
and seeing what the average was between 'em

00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:37.730
and if we found two kilometers, one being
in California and one in China that were similar,

00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:49.940
then we'd move on to the next kilometer. And
if those are similar, we'd move on to the

00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:53.220
next kilometer and so forth.

00:50:53.220 --> 00:51:02.710
So it was a very kind of a crude search in
the end, but ultimately we did find a section

00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:10.750
of California topography in Northern California,
ironically enough about 14 miles south of

00:51:10.750 --> 00:51:21.770
Mt. Shasta where we started our first expedition.
And this topography was very much like the

00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:42.500
section of land in China. Its, we went there
and hiked it and there's a fun story behind

00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:45.430
that whole thing, but I'll skip that for the
moment.

00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:49.930
Here's the installation; it's two pieces of
digitally etched glass that are about an inch

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:55.180
thick and four feet by four feet. The one
on the right over here is China and the one

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.869
on the left is obviously California.

00:51:57.869 --> 00:52:05.300
So when you're in a gallery, you see these
two projections, you see the etched glass,

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:10.970
and within the projections you're seeing video
documentation from the expedition in China,

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:17.760
and then video doc-documentation from the
expedition in California, as well as kind

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:21.650
of a-a animated recreation of the search.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:34.079
So as you look at the piece you get a sense
of the process of making the piece both in

00:52:34.079 --> 00:52:41.270
terms of physical expeditions but also in
terms of the-the data mining that was going

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:42.270
on.

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:46.770
So one of our goals with this work was that
since we had been doing so much screen based

00:52:46.770 --> 00:52:56.869
work in the late '90s and prior to this, and
one of the things that we noticed was there

00:52:56.869 --> 00:53:09.160
was a lack of engagement by the public to
view, the work we were showing is typically

00:53:09.160 --> 00:53:16.849
in galleries and museums and people are much,
seemed to be much more engaged by more physical,

00:53:16.849 --> 00:53:21.590
sculptural kinds of work; more conventional
in an art world sense.

00:53:21.590 --> 00:53:31.730
So we were trying to merge our interests in
data and technology with a more visceral experience

00:53:31.730 --> 00:53:47.940
that you might expect to get from a museum.
So we, that's one of the reasons why we kinda

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:58.000
transitioned into this very kinda tactile,
visceral, sculptural work that's glass and

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.200
aluminum and whatnot.

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:16.630
And there's a lot of craftsmanship in there.
They were really beautiful pieces, they are.

00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:24.310
The third piece is called "Perfect View" and
that's the one that I was kind of like the

00:54:24.310 --> 00:54:32.330
project manager for, and we would kind of
do that. We'd chose various people to head

00:54:32.330 --> 00:54:33.330
up these projects.

00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:42.570
This is the one I was in charge of and what
it ended up being was a 13,000 mile trek around

00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:46.910
the country guided by sublime sites supposedly,
sublime sites whose locations were given to

00:54:46.910 --> 00:54:48.150
me by geocachers.

00:54:48.150 --> 00:54:55.010
And geocaching is a hobby where people create
a treasure, they hide the treasure somewhere.

00:54:55.010 --> 00:55:01.160
There-there are caches around here in the
city but most of them are out in rural areas.

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:05.340
So they hide these treasures and they record
the latitude and longitude coordinates for

00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:10.570
them and put them up on a Website. And then
other geocachers, and there's thousands of

00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:19.010
them in the country, go and look for the caches
for fun, for exercise, and it's a family thing,

00:55:19.010 --> 00:55:21.170
it's all kinds of reasons to go.

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:26.770
But this was a large group of people that
I could approach and say, "Well give me latitude

00:55:26.770 --> 00:55:31.619
and longitude coordinates for places that
you think are sublime." And that generated

00:55:31.619 --> 00:55:52.210
a whole conversation online with this group
of people about, "What is sublimity and how

00:55:52.210 --> 00:56:00.869
is it looked at in the, in the 18th and 19th
centuries versus today?" So it was kind of

00:56:00.869 --> 00:56:04.579
a interesting dialog that happened out of
that.

00:56:04.579 --> 00:56:08.869
But ultimately I was given 60 locations from
which I chose about 25. So the picture that

00:56:08.869 --> 00:56:15.770
you're seeing on the left here is one of the
caches. Not a fabulous cache, just a plastic

00:56:15.770 --> 00:56:18.090
box with some stuff in it. [chuckles]

00:56:18.090 --> 00:56:25.510
But the real idea of-of geocaching is to get
to unusual place, locations that you wouldn't

00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:30.440
necessarily go to.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:40.220
So this happens to be in the northeast edge
of the lower peninsula of Michigan where there

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:47.430
is a river with a big oxbow turn, and you
have to hike through the woods to get there

00:56:47.430 --> 00:56:54.299
and when you get there you're like above this
really, cool turn in the river that you wouldn't

00:56:54.299 --> 00:56:59.440
know about really unless you were a geocacher
or you lived locally.

00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:04.160
So these are some of the sites that I was
given; everywhere from you see Mississippi

00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:09.250
and Texas and oddly enough very few in the
Southwest -- like nobody gave me the Grand

00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:13.010
Canyon, but I would have skipped it anyway.
The obvious ones I ---

00:57:13.010 --> 00:57:14.619
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:16.240
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: What's that?

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.780
&gt;&gt;female in audience: [unintelligible]

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:20.050
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah. [laughs]

00:57:20.050 --> 00:57:28.010
So these are what the pieces look like for
a perfect view. They're tryptics; there are

00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:34.780
three panels. The large one is photographic
documentation of the location. They're about

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:43.880
six, seven feet large, shot digitally and
then stitched together so you kind of have

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:50.170
a panoramic effect, but they're combined also
with satellite, aerial satellite imagery of

00:57:50.170 --> 00:57:56.810
that location with a dot that tells you where
I was for the experience of sublimity when

00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:59.980
I made the photograph.

00:57:59.980 --> 00:58:10.990
And then the lower left image is a CGI recreation
of the topography using USGS data fed into

00:58:10.990 --> 00:58:12.730
a 3D modeler, right?

00:58:12.730 --> 00:58:18.630
So you're looking at the landscape in these
three different modes.

00:58:18.630 --> 00:58:25.299
So hopefully it encourages people to reflect
on the new advent of-of imaging and experiencing

00:58:25.299 --> 00:58:32.800
these topographies and what does it, how does
it affect our experience of nature, of these

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:40.650
topographies. Can we evaluate the topography
and come up with some kind of ideas about

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:43.849
what sublime is or not?

00:58:43.849 --> 00:59:01.530
This is in Northern New York looking up at
the Adirondacks. It happens to be what's called

00:59:01.530 --> 00:59:05.579
a virtual cache. There's no box there. You're
intended to go there and just experience the

00:59:05.579 --> 00:59:06.579
site.

00:59:06.579 --> 00:59:07.579
[pause]

00:59:07.579 --> 00:59:12.109
This is in Kentucky. It's a natural arch.
It's a pretty cool piece 'cause it does have

00:59:12.109 --> 00:59:18.589
all this natural beauty but down in the bottom
left corner it has Michael loves Debra, so.

00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:19.970
[laughs] And that was, that was heartwarming.

00:59:19.970 --> 00:59:20.970
[pause]

00:59:20.970 --> 00:59:21.970
This is up in Maine --

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:22.970
[pause]

00:59:22.970 --> 00:59:34.569
and this is a video that I'll skip 'cause
it runs a little bit long, but it's a really

00:59:34.569 --> 00:59:57.740
nice interview. It's up on YouTube. My channel
is Mad Chalet. But if you do a search for

00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:04.490
Fatboy Slim, you might come across this and
this is one of the geocachers that just does

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:13.859
a really nice, gives a nice story about this
cache and Big Bend National Park that was

01:00:13.859 --> 01:00:25.609
really an impressive cache 'cause it is out
in the middle of the desert and you hike about

01:00:25.609 --> 01:00:31.319
a half mile, three-quarters of a mile through
the desert up into this nook and the-the climate

01:00:31.319 --> 01:00:36.059
completely changes from dry desertous to cool,
wet waterfall with butterflies. [laughs] It's

01:00:36.059 --> 01:00:40.450
just like, "Wow, where did this come from?"
And he's the one that directed me to that

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:41.880
cache and he's got a really nice story about
that.

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.190
And then that's the bike 'cause just you know
we all like bikes. Biking is cool. That's

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:51.450
the bike that did the-the dirty work getting
me around the country.

01:00:51.450 --> 01:01:08.400
And then last but not least is "The C5 GPS
Media Player" which is an interface, online

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:17.050
interface for being able to, oh I'm not online.
[laughs] For being able to see the projects

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:20.180
"Analogous Landscape," "Other Path," and "Perfect
View" and see documentation and written notes

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:25.599
about locations, be able to load track logs
from different expeditions, and see geotagged

01:01:25.599 --> 01:01:26.930
imagery that relates to these expeditions.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.720
When this was done in 2004, before geotagging
was a common, as-as common as it is today,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.320
so we wrote some software kind of make the-the
date/time code, timestamp in the photograph

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320
correlate to the track log information so
it would poke these images up with their track

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.320
logs.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.320
So, anyway you can play this interface. There's
I hope you go and explore it. It's at c5corp.com.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.320
You'll be able to find this interface under
"The Landscape Initiative."

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.320
So anyway that's "The Landscape Initiative"
and that's a little bit about C5 and I'm happy

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:38.320
to answer questions about any of that stuff.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.320
Yes.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320
&gt;&gt;male in audience: You said you had a funny
story about the California version of the

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320
Great Wall.

01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Well a funny story about finding
the California version of The Great Wall is

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:48.030
that here we are with our GPS devices; everybody
had a GPS device, right? And pretty good GPS

01:01:48.030 --> 01:01:51.890
device; pretty accurate. And the GPS device
telling you, "Go this way. Go that way." We

01:01:51.890 --> 01:01:56.589
all think we know so much where it is. And
we thought, "People are gonna find this in

01:01:56.589 --> 01:02:01.770
about an hour, maybe an hour, maybe an hour
and a half max." Right? And we, this happens

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:02.920
to be right next to the Pacific Coast Trail.
So we're up there hiking the Pacific Coast

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:10.660
Trail just havin' a great time and two hours
go by and then three hours go by, literally

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:32.730
four hours go by and we're like, we just finally
stop and pull out our maps and look at the

01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:38.910
map, the paper map, and we find out, "Oh,
we've been hiking around the point we were

01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:42.460
trying to get to." The point that our GPS
device kept on telling us, "Go here. Go here,"

01:02:42.460 --> 01:02:44.990
was in the middle of the trail which was doing
this big arc and around-around a hill so the,

01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:48.319
we're trying to get to the Wall of California
and it was up this very steep hill in the

01:02:48.319 --> 01:02:54.141
middle of the trail; it was kind of circumventing
this hill [laughs]. So we'd been hiking around

01:02:54.141 --> 01:03:03.690
and around and around and we needed to go
up, up, up. So it's just that one of those

01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:06.030
ironies that here you've got all this technology,
you've looked at a map already, and then you

01:03:06.030 --> 01:03:09.200
get there and it took four hours. We were
lucky to get back before it went dark. [laughs]

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.570
So that's that story.

01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:11.570
Yeah.

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:12.570
&gt;&gt;male in audience: What's, is sublime, is
beautiful sublime, is [unintelligible sublime?

01:03:12.570 --> 01:03:13.570
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Right?

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:14.570
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Why'd you chose that word
and what did you learn about the word?

01:03:14.570 --> 01:03:15.570
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah.

01:03:15.570 --> 01:03:16.570
&gt;&gt;male in audience: from the experience?

01:03:16.570 --> 01:03:17.570
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah. Yeah. Well that's a great
question.

01:03:17.570 --> 01:03:18.570
One of the reasons I choose the word "sublime"
is I was interested in drawing parallels between

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:19.570
our time and the enlightenment, right?

01:03:19.570 --> 01:03:20.640
And if you go back in the 18th century a lot
of writing and a lot of art was being done

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:26.700
about the sublime. And if you look at Kant
and a guy named Edwin Burke, their take on

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.000
the sublime was that, was maybe beautiful
but it was more than beautiful, it was terrifying.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.320
It was something that was threatening. You
were feeling the force of nature which made

01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:41.069
you so aware of your own mortality and forced
you to kind of transcend your rational capabilities

01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:46.609
and move to another plane, right? So it was
that kind of a thing.

01:03:46.609 --> 01:03:49.339
So that, and the reason I choose "sublime"
was to tap into that, but also it's a term

01:03:49.339 --> 01:03:54.859
that kind of gets thrown around loosely and
often associated with landscape and loosely.

01:03:54.859 --> 01:03:55.859
And today we do kind of think of it as something
very unusually beautiful, but it does have

01:03:55.859 --> 01:03:56.859
this more threatening quality to it, and that
more threatening quality came into play in

01:03:56.859 --> 01:03:57.859
several of the locations that I would visit,
which were banal in a lot of respects but

01:03:57.859 --> 01:03:58.859
they had this challenging element to them
that was reminiscent of what Kant or Burke

01:03:58.859 --> 01:03:59.859
might have been writing about.

01:03:59.859 --> 01:04:00.859
But ultimately what sublime is is we pretty
much can guess, it's very subjective, right?

01:04:00.859 --> 01:04:01.859
So I'm in the Ozark Mountains and somebody
tells me to go to Hocksville Crag 'cause it's

01:04:01.859 --> 01:04:05.450
sublime and I go way out of my way. The ride
to get there was sublime [laughs] going through

01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:10.620
the woods and getting there and then here's
a rock that's looking over trees in a valley

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:11.620
and it was like, "Okay."

01:04:11.620 --> 01:04:12.620
But if you'd just been to Zion National Park
two weeks beforehand where you're like on

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:13.620
top of this rock and the canyons are just
like blow you away kind of quality, it was

01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:14.620
like you wanted to tell the person to go to
Zion National Park. [laughs] 'Cause like so,

01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:15.620
but everybody's got their-their sense of what
sublime is.

01:04:15.620 --> 01:04:16.880
So somebody else sent me into a public park
in the middle of Nebraska; a little stand

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:19.299
of trees in between baseball fields and basketball
courts and here's this little stand of trees

01:04:19.299 --> 01:04:20.299
with some small rocks in there --

01:04:20.299 --> 01:04:21.299
[laughter]

01:04:21.299 --> 01:04:22.299
So it was very intimate whole different thing.

01:04:22.299 --> 01:04:24.859
So yeah, sublime is hard to put your finger
on and everybody depending on what your context

01:04:24.859 --> 01:04:28.619
is and what your background and what you're
bringing to is it's very subjective.

01:04:28.619 --> 01:04:30.440
So it really wasn't to try to do-do a scientific
analysis of sublimity, but to use that as

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.900
a, as a guide for me to go around the country
and apply these technologies to looking at

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:34.900
topography and landscape.

01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:35.900
So I'm also doing what we now call social
networking and sourcing information from a

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:36.900
cloud and finding locations to go and visit.
So it was just a way to interact with people

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.210
and get this series of way points that I wouldn't
have been able to get any other way, if that

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:41.210
makes sense.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:42.210
[pause]

01:04:42.210 --> 01:04:43.210
Yeah.

01:04:43.210 --> 01:04:44.210
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible] What
did you do experientially [unintelligible}?

01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:45.210
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: The survey? [laughs] But sitting
on the Palm Pilots in a box somewhere. We

01:04:45.210 --> 01:04:46.210
didn't really like process it, but we exhibited
as you, that photograph has those Palm Pilots

01:04:46.210 --> 01:04:47.210
there and each one would have showed different
answers like the one that you see most closely

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:52.170
in that picture is a tree. So that was one
of the aspects of the survey was like a draw

01:04:52.170 --> 01:04:56.180
a picture of what you see in front of you.
So somebody drew a tree.

01:04:56.180 --> 01:04:59.200
But those would be displayed and have various
questions from the survey so you can kinda

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:10.020
get a sense of what the emotional response
was to that hike.

01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020
[pause]

01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.020
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:13.020
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah. Well I think it would
be interesting. I don't know about useful,

01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.020
but it would be interesting. Yeah.

01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:15.020
[pause]

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:16.020
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible]

01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.020
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: An-an emotional mountain?

01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.020
&gt;&gt;voice in audience: [unintelligible]

01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.020
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: [laughs] That would be cool.
That's a good name for it too, The Emotion

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.020
 -- [laughs]

01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.020
Yeah, one of the things about C5 was that
we were always kind of looking towards the

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:22.700
next thing. So this project we really could
have spent many years on it. Just on one of

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:28.810
them doing "The Analogous Landscape" and hiking
the mountains around the Pacific Rim. That

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:29.920
could have been a really, a long undertaking.

01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.180
But because of, I don't know, the personalities
involved in the collaboration, we're just

01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:36.980
antsy and moving on. So once we kind of got
the concept across in these pieces, we were

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.700
already on to doing our next project was called
"Quest for Success" which was another GPS

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:39.700
kind of game interactivity kind of thing that
took place in San Jose.

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.550
So -- and before you knew it, we dissolved
in 2007 so that these projects kind of, they

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:42.550
were at that standstill. So --

01:05:42.550 --> 01:05:43.550
And then individually we've kind of gone on
and worked in various modes, some of us doing

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:44.550
located media.

01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:45.550
[pause]

01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:46.550
&gt;&gt;female in audience: I just am wondering
how that sublime location project that you

01:05:46.550 --> 01:05:47.550
undertook, was it ever part of the C5 Group?

01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:48.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:49.550
&gt;&gt;female in audience: So-so you came up with
the idea together, but you were the one to

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:50.550
execute it?

01:05:50.550 --> 01:05:51.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah, I-I executed most of
it. And that happened to be true for a lot

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:52.550
of the projects, but we were all involved
in various aspects of the projects.

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:53.550
We all went on the hikes and somebody else's
modeling created CGI imagery for the-the tryptics

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.550
that you saw. I mean I-I did the, I spent
the two months traveling around the country

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.550
photographing places and actually built the
tryptics.

01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:56.550
But I mean the idea for it and some of the
work that went into it was, it was a collaborative

01:05:56.550 --> 01:05:57.550
thing that made it happen; the discussions
that we had. And there was actually some really

01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:58.550
kinda funny stories how we got to doing expeditions
and all that. We got there because of alcohol

01:05:58.550 --> 01:05:59.550
basically. [chuckles]

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:00.550
[laughter]

01:06:00.550 --> 01:06:01.550
There's a, a lot of fun there.

01:06:01.550 --> 01:06:02.550
But anyway I feel like I'm eating up, eating
into time here.

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:03.550
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: You have a couple minutes
for more questions.

01:06:03.550 --> 01:06:04.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Okay.

01:06:04.550 --> 01:06:05.550
Yeah.

01:06:05.550 --> 01:06:06.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:07.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Ah, you know I don't know.
I don't how their, what are they doing with

01:06:07.550 --> 01:06:08.550
geocaching --

01:06:08.550 --> 01:06:09.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Basically [unintelligible]

01:06:09.550 --> 01:06:10.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:10.550 --> 01:06:11.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: [unintelligible]

01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:12.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Right.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:13.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: And then there's like
this whole gaming culture around it [unintelligible]

01:06:13.550 --> 01:06:14.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: But that sounds like that's
much more geared towards urban, suburban kind

01:06:14.550 --> 01:06:15.550
of area, yeah?

01:06:15.550 --> 01:06:16.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah.

01:06:16.550 --> 01:06:17.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: At least with what you're describing
 --

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:18.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah.

01:06:18.550 --> 01:06:19.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: in terms of cache being --

01:06:19.550 --> 01:06:20.550
&gt;&gt;male in audience: Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:21.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: You know I think that the people
who-who-who are into geocaching are at least

01:06:21.550 --> 01:06:22.550
as much into hiking and being out in nature.
Although li-like I said there are caches in

01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:23.550
Manhattan, in urban areas too.

01:06:23.550 --> 01:06:24.550
So well one of the funny things about geocaching
is that you're using this technology to get

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:25.550
very close to the cache and once you're very
close to the cache, it's gets increasingly

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:26.550
harder to find it 'cause the-the GPS only
has about 15 feet of accuracy and it depends

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:27.550
on you moving. And once you get within 15
feet your tendency is to stop and say, --

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:28.550
&gt;&gt;female in audience: There's no one who says,
"Hotter, hotter, colder, colder?"

01:06:28.550 --> 01:06:29.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Nobody does that. [laughs]

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:30.550
[laughter]

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:31.550
So you're looking around and chances are the
thing is right there, Scott's got it and,

01:06:31.550 --> 01:06:32.550
but you spend 45 minutes looking for Scott
'cause you can't find it, but this is one

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:33.550
of those ironic things about --

01:06:33.550 --> 01:06:34.550
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: We have time for one more
question.

01:06:34.550 --> 01:06:35.550
[pause]

01:06:35.550 --> 01:06:36.550
&gt;&gt;female in audience: What's next?

01:06:36.550 --> 01:06:37.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Well I've been working on photographic
projects; a project called "White Collar"

01:06:37.550 --> 01:06:38.550
that actually has, that focuses on middle
aged white men, businessmen who are faced

01:06:38.550 --> 01:06:39.550
with the transitions happening in global economics
and-and I'm tryin', I am capturing kind of

01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:40.550
the psychological states possibly that they're
experiencing.

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:41.550
And so I have a body of work that's about
that specifically. I've done a lot of work

01:06:41.550 --> 01:06:42.550
about economics over the years and that work
is transitioning into mapping people's commutes

01:06:42.550 --> 01:06:43.550
and thinking about how lifestyles are related
to workspace and what that transition is between

01:06:43.550 --> 01:06:44.550
life, home life and work; so there's a project
that has to do with mapping commutes and kind

01:06:44.550 --> 01:06:45.550
of in a psychogeographic way.

01:06:45.550 --> 01:06:46.550
I mean what's your experience of your commute?
And what do you think you're passing through

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:47.550
when you pass through Jersey City? What do
you think it is? And then, and then drawing

01:06:47.550 --> 01:06:48.550
up data that talks about what it is. What
is the demographic and what is the economic

01:06:48.550 --> 01:06:49.550
situation of that town? As opposed to what
your perception of it is, right?

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:50.550
So that's what I'm working on.

01:06:50.550 --> 01:06:51.550
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Good. Thank you very much.

01:06:51.550 --> 01:06:52.550
&gt;&gt;Jack Toolin: Yep.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:53.550
[applause]

01:06:53.550 --> 01:06:54.550
&gt;&gt;Scott Draves: Okay, that's the end of our
program this evening. I'd like to also encourage

01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.550
you to come to our-our future lectures.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:56.550
So on Friday, October 1st we have Rachel Armstrong
and Mitchell Jaochim speaking about their

01:06:56.550 --> 01:06:57.550
art and closing up on Thursday, October 21st,
we have Marina Zurkow and our own Andrew Senior

01:06:57.550 --> 01:06:58.550
and Sandra Cordero speaking about their pieces.

01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:59.550
So thanks again for coming and I hope to see
you all on Friday the 1st.

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:00.550
Good night.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:00.551
[applause]
