WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
Songs that the whole name of the song.
Yep.
That's it.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:02.970
That's the whole name of the song.

3
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.740
There's no need for the fucking music young Jamie.

4
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.730
I like that.
That was the beginning of it.
That's it.
Oh,

5
00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:16.230
mother fucking live.
Oh,
we're doing it here.
We're doing it.
Oh,
nice.

6
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.680
That's a great note.
They bizarre.
Yeah,
I like it.
Yeah.
Happy with it.

7
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.750
Ori motherfucking CIF fear has a billboard.
If there was a movie about your life,

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.680
um,
and then this happened the way it happened,
I would go,
uh,
they didn't,

9
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.850
I was too much.
Yeah,
too true.
Troy.
No Way.
Oh,

10
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:36.210
I had a billboard above where I lived for 10 years as he struggled.
Yeah.

11
00:00:36.211 --> 00:00:38.460
As he was fucking destitute,

12
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.140
living in this little shitty area of Hollywood,
like 13 grand a year,

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.820
right next to the comedy store.

14
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.580
Right down the street from the comedy store is the cheapest housing near the

15
00:00:47.581 --> 00:00:51.610
comedy store.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I remember every time I'd visit you and be like,

16
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.070
we're safe here.
Can we walk through this?
Everything.
All right.
You live with,

17
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.570
it wasn't dangerous,
but it was bad.

18
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.300
And then eventually the homeless people started moving in.
Yeah.

19
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.680
You lived with some sketchy folk?
Oh,
sure.
There was only a few people were like,

20
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:07.960
I didn't walk through your halls.
Like I would walk through the Ritz Carlton's

21
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.800
pillows.
Like I was on a,
I wouldn't say I'm on,
Oh,
you know,
Code Red,

22
00:01:13.801 --> 00:01:17.100
but I was on code yellow or whatever the fuck the terrorist code is.

23
00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.650
I had a little bit of,
we had this,
these er,
these horns.

24
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.860
There's kind of like that,
that Brady,
uh,
that chain you have there,

25
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.150
this thing with the beads.
Yeah.
It was hanging up with this weird horn thing,

26
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.540
like on the railing and a corner.
And I asked my friend there,
I was like,

27
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.660
how long has this been there?
Because before I moved in and were like,

28
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.970
do you want move?
You fucking move it.
It just looked like Voodoo ish.

29
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
And we were like,
maybe it's keeping the place up and nothing was there for 10,

30
00:01:40.891 --> 00:01:42.990
12 years and you haven't touched it.

31
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.720
And you had this great deal where this apartment,

32
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.500
like they wanted to turn it into something else and they want to say it's prime

33
00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:53.040
real estate.
Sunset and Laci undergo son,
son Los [inaudible].

34
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.730
They put a dope apartment building up in there.
People would kind of want to do,

35
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:59.840
but everyone above and the hill,
the Richie's got mad.
They're like,

36
00:01:59.841 --> 00:02:03.320
you're going to block our view.
Ah,
the rich.
And they blocked it forever.

37
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.280
Plus even if it was like,
all right,
all the new one,

38
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:08.490
there'll be no blockage of you.
I'm going to put a rooftop garden on there.

39
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:13.440
So all you'll see is greenery and flowers.
Um,
about that.
Still not,

40
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.370
it's going to mess up traffic while you're building.
He goes,
yeah,

41
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:19.720
it is going to mess up traffic a little.
And then he got a deal with pink dot.

42
00:02:19.721 --> 00:02:22.020
He goes,
how about we only enter through the pink dot parking lot?

43
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.210
And they were like,
still not.
Yeah,
that takes years,
right?
Yeah.

44
00:02:27.211 --> 00:02:30.060
So that he finally got the okay.
People were moving out one by one.

45
00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.730
He was given deals to people and he gave you a deal.
Give me a deal.

46
00:02:32.731 --> 00:02:34.710
I got the deal.
I think I might have in the last one to get the deal.

47
00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.430
Ari's always been so swamped talking,
looking out here,

48
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.900
but you've always been so like for a comic you've always been so smart with

49
00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:46.080
money.
Well,
I knew that as soon as I was out of money,
I was out of this dream.

50
00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.500
[inaudible]
my,
my,
my,
my amount of money I had was time.

51
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.480
So if I had five grand in the bank,

52
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:54.120
that's six months before I had to quit and moved back to Maryland,

53
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.110
go to paralegal school,
whatever it was.
You were never moving back.
Dude,

54
00:02:58.111 --> 00:03:00.370
I would've never let you move back.
So I don't know.

55
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:04.150
I would have never let you move back.
I would've fucking kidnapped you.

56
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.760
Maybe your body guard.
Well,
I,
I knew when we first met,

57
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.410
there's certain comics where you meet them when they're really young and you go,

58
00:03:14.411 --> 00:03:17.420
dude,
all you have to do is just keep going.
Just keep going.
Yeah,

59
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.350
you could do this.
There's guys that you go,
man,
I don't know.

60
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.120
Like there's guys who became like super successful.

61
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:24.220
Like Sebastian is a really good example.

62
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:29.221
I got to see Sebastian really early in his career and he's a really funny comic.

63
00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.730
You really,
really,
really fun.
Yeah,
but he wasn't back then.

64
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.590
It wasn't until admitted.
We will all look.
I wasn't either when I was young,

65
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.820
somebody,
if they're really bad,
you'd be like,

66
00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.970
you should maybe quit like a year or two lady like,
oh,
okay.

67
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:45.880
You're starting to get it.
If you saw me when I was one year in,

68
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.420
I mean fucking Christ,
you probably would've told me to quit.
I was terrible.

69
00:03:49.421 --> 00:03:53.800
I was 21 I was an idiot.
I didn't know anything about anything in life.

70
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.860
I told you what times four is,
you're showing me your math skills.
I totally said,

71
00:03:56.861 --> 00:04:00.070
what's seven times four?
It's an easy one.
You were like 11 and you're like,
no,

72
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.610
you're awful.
But then you realize like,
okay,
maybe you're starting to get this.

73
00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:06.520
You at least know that you can add those things.
Yeah.
Well,

74
00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:10.570
you have 10 that eventually you get experience.
You have to have life experience.

75
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.490
I didn't have life experience.

76
00:04:12.491 --> 00:04:14.910
I didn't even have regular people's life experiences.

77
00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.160
All new comics do jokes about not being able to get laid is young.

78
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:22.660
Fucking uncomfortable.
People can't get late.
That's most of their experience.

79
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.680
I know you don't want to fuck me and it's like,
yeah,

80
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:27.010
I tell everybody thinks a 24 yeah,

81
00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:30.220
but when you're a comic and you'd been a comic for a long time,

82
00:04:30.221 --> 00:04:32.350
you see someone who's doing it like they're starting out.

83
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.340
There was some kid on kill Tony.
Yeah,
I had a conversation with them afterwards.

84
00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.020
I go,
dude,
you really funny that you can really do this.

85
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.450
Like we had this long conversation,
like how long have you been doing this?

86
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.600
He's like,
two years.
I go do,
you're really good.
You could do this.

87
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.480
I could just keep going.
Just keep,
you got to just keep,
just keep going.

88
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.780
Just got to keep going.
One another secret you'll take.
There's no secrets,
man.

89
00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:54.280
Just keep going.
But that's what I knew with you.
You know,
artists gave me advice.

90
00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.350
I might have told you this.

91
00:04:55.351 --> 00:04:59.020
I went through my first Rudd where like everything was hitting a little worse.

92
00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.200
If it was like an a plus room,
my jokes that should get at,

93
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.600
but we're getting like a B plus and you're like an a be room.

94
00:05:04.601 --> 00:05:06.670
They were getting a c and I'm like,
I don't know what's happening here.

95
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.540
These jokes do better.

96
00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.170
And I asked a bunch of people for advice and you were like,
yeah,
you're,

97
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.600
we've grown pastor material so he's got to get new material.
Freddy was like,

98
00:05:13.601 --> 00:05:16.360
do it like a thousand times so you'd know it so well it's not a hundred times.

99
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:19.960
But that argus gave me this advice that he goes,
well,

100
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.070
maybe comedy is not your thing.

101
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.230
And I was like so mad about,
oh my God.

102
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:29.560
The reality as he was talking to some young new guy who's like,
I don't know man,

103
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:32.650
it's not going well.
And he's like,
the fucking,
I can see what his point of view.

104
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.380
It's like,
well if you don't want to do this you should get out.
Well,

105
00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:40.381
our guests has been doing it way longer than me and he was at the store for like

106
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.180
in like the seventies late seventies so like,

107
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:46.270
he's probably so tired of hearing that.
Yeah,
dude,
shut up.

108
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.440
Shut up to if you want to do it or don't.
But you know what man,
those guys,

109
00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:55.500
I feel like they do the art form of disservice because I think that people,

110
00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:59.810
not argus in general,
we like people who don't take time to talk to young comics.

111
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.850
They think of talent because comics are super fragile in the beginning because

112
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.230
one of the reasons why I was like always like really friendly to mark Marin for

113
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:13.580
like years after,
before we've,
why we like had some weirdness with each other.

114
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.680
He gave me advice when I was,

115
00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:20.681
when I was like really young when I was like 21 and I was just doing open mic

116
00:06:20.781 --> 00:06:25.560
nights.
Yeah,
I did the comedy connection.
Once he gave me advice,
he said,

117
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.640
he goes,
dude.
He goes,
you're really good.
He goes,
you could do this.
He said,
um,

118
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.090
he goes,
just don't listen to all these other people.
He goes,

119
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.640
you're really original.
You got your own thing you're doing.
He said,

120
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:37.970
just keep writing.
Just keep writing.
Yeah,
and I remember like,

121
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.530
man was like a successful comic.
Then you know,
he was like a,
he would work,

122
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:46.250
you know,
he would like,
you know,
there'd be a show,
they'd be Jackie Flynn,

123
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:49.790
Mark Merritt,
like he was on the marquee or the whatever he was on the lineup.

124
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:53.030
He was getting paid.
If you're a new guy,
look up at someone,
anyone like that.

125
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.630
It's like,
wow,
you're doing this for a living.
That was so important to me.

126
00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.680
And so I think that when I remember that like back in those days,

127
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:04.790
I mean when,
when someone can come along and just give you just a little nudge,

128
00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:09.430
just a little piece and then you have to realize where we're all the same God

129
00:07:09.431 --> 00:07:13.730
damn thing in this,
this idea,
this just because you've been doing it longer.

130
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.280
Like a guy who's been doing it for like six months,
he's a real comic.

131
00:07:16.281 --> 00:07:20.720
He's still a comic.
He's a comic book.
It doesn't matter that it's broken poor.

132
00:07:20.721 --> 00:07:23.570
He's been doing it for six months.
He's you,
dude.
We're the same thing.

133
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:24.740
I'll try to write a good picture.
Okay.

134
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:28.070
We want to get to pretend you're something different once you're successful.

135
00:07:28.071 --> 00:07:31.430
That's ridiculous.
That sounds so crazy.
Like every,

136
00:07:31.431 --> 00:07:34.370
all you're trying to do is make people laugh.
That's all you're trying to do.

137
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:37.190
That's all they're trying to do.
The same thing.
Even if people,

138
00:07:37.191 --> 00:07:40.490
more people going to see you or more people want to see another guy,

139
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.900
that's not what matters.
What matters is like Russell Peters,

140
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:48.520
perfect example.
Russell Peters treats everybody like they're comics.

141
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.980
He treats everybody.
Young guys,

142
00:07:50.981 --> 00:07:52.910
this company wants who's talking to the front hallway.

143
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:57.590
Tommy was working the cover booth and he was also a teller coordinator and,
uh,

144
00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.460
there were just talking in the front and,
um,
Russell's like,

145
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.250
you're good on Ya.
And he goes,
until he was like,
no,

146
00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:07.580
he wasn't passed as a paid regular yet.
And he goes,
no,
I don't really,
uh,

147
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.670
it's not,
you could tell he was already upset about it,
but he said,

148
00:08:10.671 --> 00:08:12.830
what do you mean you don't get up here?
He goes,
you know,

149
00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.760
in the belly room sometimes,
and then Russell just turns the Tom.
He goes,
hey man,

150
00:08:16.761 --> 00:08:20.330
you should put him up.
He's really funny.
You kidding?
You've got to put him up.

151
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.210
The guy like Tommy,
you could,
you could do that.
Yeah,
you can overpower.

152
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.720
And it's like,
yeah,
well why not tell somebody like,
okay,
tell me.

153
00:08:26.721 --> 00:08:29.510
I'll email the right.
Just write that and it's like,
Hey,
do it.
This guy's funny.

154
00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:33.490
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I um,
whoa.

155
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:37.790
Remember when Chris Mcguire passed at the store and I hosted the whole night

156
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.790
because you don't understand Peter Chin was going to host and he was the worst

157
00:08:40.791 --> 00:08:43.880
comment.
I still get emails from them sometimes.
These new pilots he's made,

158
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:45.740
he was beyond terrible.

159
00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:50.810
He was like a foreign Asian who had nothing.
He had nothing.

160
00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:53.570
He was there to exist for dom bears to fuck with.

161
00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:57.450
He's going to be very upset at you over is going to be very upset that you know,

162
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:02.280
he's on his pilots.
He's age.
I watched him every time he's out there trying,

163
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.810
they're like 38 minutes as a pilot or like four minutes as a pilot.

164
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:10.630
They make no sense.
Oh,
they're so great dunk.

165
00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:14.220
He thought he was just doing a character.
So you had to sit next to Mitzi.

166
00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.790
Oh yeah.
You got people past sit next to them and laugh.
She's actually watch.

167
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.970
That's how I got in.
I got in because of the tod.
The Todd sat there,
they,

168
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.720
Todd hooked me up and he told me he was hooked me up and he told me,

169
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:28.560
you do it to other comics too or heard Louis called for this guy I worked with

170
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:32.580
in San Francisco and I needed a,
an an MC and she was like,
well,
there's a,

171
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.630
who am I?
Somebody good,
please get somebody really good.
But anyway,

172
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.380
Louis called the punchline for this guy,
so I'm somewhere and he was like,
Hey,

173
00:09:40.381 --> 00:09:43.950
that guy's funny,
so you should help him.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
Yeah man,

174
00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:48.180
that's important for all of us were we,
you know,
we're also fans of it,
right.

175
00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:51.390
I want to be.
I want to see other,
I want to be in the audience.

176
00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.280
Want to see funny shit.
Yeah dudes.
Now federal do really good.
So here's,

177
00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.180
here's the Ra center story.
So he's living in his fucking apartment.
Okay.

178
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:04.440
This is crazy apartment.
It did have a pool.
It was fucking sweet for the price.

179
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:07.440
It was Scott Damn sweet.
Oh Yeah Dude,
you had to hook good hookup.

180
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.410
I mean it wasn't totally dangerous mean,
you know,

181
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.910
but like they wouldn't want to do the,
once people started moving out,

182
00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.610
they don't want to do any repairs.
So it was just like leaves were around.

183
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.490
It looked like the apocalypse.
It hit like walking dead.

184
00:10:17.491 --> 00:10:21.940
But they found a place I've had a literal slum lord for.
Yeah,
we had a slumlord.

185
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.590
I'm more a real one.
He would always accuse us of that too.
It was like,
dude,

186
00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:29.430
do the fucking repair man.
And he's like you saying I'm a slum Lord.
It's like,
oh,

187
00:10:29.431 --> 00:10:33.870
but yes you are.
Fix The fucking clean the fucking pool.

188
00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:34.471
Looking at him,

189
00:10:34.471 --> 00:10:37.620
he gets so angry cause he had to and he just wouldn't want to do is fucking

190
00:10:37.621 --> 00:10:40.140
Armeen mean anyways.
Whoa,
whoa.

191
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:44.400
Worst how dirt was coming out of my,
my sink once.
And I'm like,
dude,

192
00:10:44.401 --> 00:10:46.380
dirt is coming out of this.
And he goes,
that's what happens.

193
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:47.520
You haven't used a second a while.
I'm like,

194
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:51.600
let me come to your place and see if happens at your place in Malibu.
Wow.

195
00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:55.990
Fuck you frank.
Whoa,
whoa.
All right.
She fear.
Okay.
So anyway,

196
00:10:55.991 --> 00:10:58.860
he's living in this apartment and you know,

197
00:10:58.890 --> 00:11:03.890
there was a point in time where things weren't going that good for a large point

198
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:08.250
in time,
like 10,
12 years.
You were,
you know,

199
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.040
putting in your time and you were trying to figure it out.
Yeah.
Um,

200
00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.410
but what was important during that time,
it was really,
really,

201
00:11:16.411 --> 00:11:18.630
really important during that time is,
um,

202
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.810
even though you weren't achieving like great financial success,

203
00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.030
you were doing well on stage.
Yeah.
It was,

204
00:11:24.031 --> 00:11:26.220
I was having people like me at my level.

205
00:11:26.221 --> 00:11:30.000
I was always like one of the better ones,
I think always doing well.
And you were,

206
00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.310
you were always working,
you were always working on new shit.

207
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:33.570
You always are trying to get better.

208
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:37.830
You're always like tweaking things and you know,
kind of like we all do.
We all,

209
00:11:37.831 --> 00:11:39.540
we all have a real similar style in that.

210
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:43.740
Like we don't have like a monologue that's prepared and that exact same way all

211
00:11:43.741 --> 00:11:46.350
the time.
The store guys can't do that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

212
00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:50.270
Like can we come for a showcase for like Montreal or s or Conan or something?

213
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.050
Six months.
I have to just start to go up,
go.

214
00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.740
So I was at the store ever notice comedy store guys fail at that when there's

215
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:59.350
eight people in the audience comedy store,
people fail.

216
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.990
Can't just go right into material.
Yeah.
They're like,

217
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.330
this is not what I supposed to do here.
I should do crowd work for seven people.

218
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:06.370
So I'm not,
yeah,
we can't do it.

219
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.520
It just seems weird because that plays control used to the honesty that flights

220
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.070
contrivance and then here you are needing to,
we can try it.
So yeah.
So go ahead.

221
00:12:15.071 --> 00:12:19.360
Sorry.
And is doing,
you know he's doing stand up at the store.
Uh,

222
00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.140
I uh,
I started taking you on the road.
That's how you found me.

223
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:25.480
What'd you find me?
Well,
how'd you find me?
Another store,
but yeah,

224
00:12:25.481 --> 00:12:28.990
but we were friendly and stuff.
You were cool.
You hung out,
you know,

225
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.480
but like how'd you go from that to like,

226
00:12:31.481 --> 00:12:35.320
hey come open for me once because I saw that there was something going on,
man.

227
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.920
Don't you even come by for the open mic or maybe that was my family room was

228
00:12:38.921 --> 00:12:42.070
there all the time.
I lived at the store basically.
Yeah.

229
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.200
When I was doing stand up in the early nineties,

230
00:12:44.201 --> 00:12:46.990
from 94 to like whatever it was that I stopped going there,

231
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:49.470
I was probably doing late spas.
Probably already paid records,

232
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.660
doing late night spots by now.
I saw you before you were paid regular dude,

233
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.340
I saw you way before.
You're paid regular.

234
00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.390
We became friends when you were first starting out there.
Really?
Yeah,
man.

235
00:12:58.391 --> 00:13:00.520
You were working there,
you were working there.

236
00:13:00.521 --> 00:13:02.170
You were one of the kids working there were always cool.

237
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:05.710
We are always talking in the parking lot and no.
Yeah.
You used to get me high.

238
00:13:05.711 --> 00:13:06.340
You had that,

239
00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.450
you had that up marijuana soda once before anybody knew what it was.
It is.

240
00:13:10.451 --> 00:13:13.490
That dates me couldn't get where you are still at the feet of Buddy Bolton

241
00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.290
learning how to fucking free pot game.
Yeah.
I would say Bolton.
Was that his name?

242
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.120
Which guy?
The Guy who first had like the medical marijuana license.
Yeah.

243
00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.170
Was that his last name?
Bolton.
Buddy Bolton.
Thanks.
That sounds right.
Yeah,

244
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:26.890
he was a cool dude.
Whatever.
I totally cool.

245
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.700
I don't know his pictures up in the cellar of those like Mana montage montage

246
00:13:30.701 --> 00:13:33.010
pictures,
but anyway.
Damn.
But yeah,

247
00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:34.660
and it was like you couldn't go to a store and buy it.

248
00:13:34.661 --> 00:13:36.220
It was just legal if you had this card,

249
00:13:36.221 --> 00:13:38.540
but it wasn't like you had to be suitable as fuck.

250
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:41.290
And I was getting mine from the um,

251
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.540
displace in um,
in the hood.
Got It.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

252
00:13:46.541 --> 00:13:48.550
It was in the hood.
I was trying to run my,

253
00:13:48.710 --> 00:13:52.810
kept the card for like the longest time.
Inglewood.
Inglewood though.

254
00:13:52.811 --> 00:13:54.760
Inglewood wellness center.
That's what it's called.

255
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:57.520
And one of the verbal nice and Nice,

256
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:01.840
nicest folks that run that place there was so nice.
And um,

257
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.400
when um,
I hadn't been there for a while and I was thinking about,
man,

258
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:09.010
I should go down there and buy something from them just to give them some love

259
00:14:09.011 --> 00:14:12.600
cause they're really nice guys.
But one of the guys got shot.
Really?
Yeah.

260
00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:17.560
One of the guys got robbed there.
Done point and shot in the stomach.
Fuck yeah.

261
00:14:17.561 --> 00:14:21.220
And he lived but I'm like,
Whoa,
what am I doing?
They got,

262
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:25.390
they got robbed because they had a lot of money on hand cash because they were

263
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:28.090
taking everything in cash.
And uh,
most,

264
00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.510
most of them didn't have credit cards until fairly recently.
Right,
right,
right.

265
00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.450
Cash.
So they were selling weed.

266
00:14:34.451 --> 00:14:38.690
Everybody knew they were selling weed and so they got robbed and he got shot.
Oh,

267
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:42.880
it's hard to talk about that man.
That sucks.
Gentle people.

268
00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.700
If you knew that you guys them and they're like,
we can take advantage of this.

269
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.660
If you knew the dude who got shot,
he was such a gentle guy.

270
00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:52.670
He just is such an less like a sweetheart,

271
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.480
like what you think of as a classic like older stoner came out really doing man.

272
00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.240
Good to see you brother.
Good.
See you.
Give me a hug man.
How are you man?

273
00:15:01.241 --> 00:15:05.810
You're like everything cool.
Always friendly.
Always like positive.

274
00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.350
And they would laugh and laugh and crack jokes and just talk about,

275
00:15:09.351 --> 00:15:14.351
we'd talk about life and all kinds of shit and this guy got shot selling weed

276
00:15:16.700 --> 00:15:18.080
so I stopped going there.
But yeah,

277
00:15:18.081 --> 00:15:20.150
but the region brought around was fucking tremendous.

278
00:15:20.151 --> 00:15:23.030
Those guys hooked it up back in the day.

279
00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:27.050
I mean this is like 99 or something like that.

280
00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:31.910
What year was I started?
I started 2009 so this is 2000 2001 yeah,

281
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.770
somewhere around there.
Makes Sense.

282
00:15:33.771 --> 00:15:36.080
Cause that's around when I started hanging out with Eddie Bravo,

283
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.980
he started [inaudible],
he corrupted me up to me and I corrupted you.

284
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:40.821
I called you,

285
00:15:40.821 --> 00:15:45.821
I refer to Rogan as LDL below for about seven months cause that'd be at the fun

286
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.460
run.
It'd be one 45 in the morning.
I put oil,
the chairs.

287
00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:52.460
I'm just sitting in the front chair looking out at sunset so high and just

288
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:56.510
thinking,
get out of me,
get out of me.

289
00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.560
And it wouldn't leave.
Do we had some fun?

290
00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:04.400
We did shows where we were so high we should definitely not have been talking to

291
00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:07.430
people.
Anybody.
They went,
great,
man.

292
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:09.980
You just gotta Kinda [inaudible] in those days on stage,

293
00:16:09.981 --> 00:16:12.270
I would just get high to be around.
You got high.

294
00:16:12.271 --> 00:16:15.890
I'm going on stage a bunch of times though.
Back then later.
Yeah.

295
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:20.390
The one in Boston,
one of Boston's flood.
That was the first time.

296
00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:24.710
That was the first time Rogan's refused to let me not get hot.
He goes,
hey,

297
00:16:24.711 --> 00:16:28.670
let's get hot going.
The hotel was like across the street and they were like,

298
00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:31.160
I was up there.
I mean,
come on man.
We gotta go.
We gotta go.
He's like,
all right,

299
00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:32.360
quick and high first.
So I was like,
what?

300
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.460
I hope you'll be onstage and looking 18 minutes and you were like,
Nah,

301
00:16:37.461 --> 00:16:39.350
who cares?
I'm like,
no,
I won't be able to be good.
He goes,

302
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:43.290
who do you think you work for it work with this fortune 80 seat room or that you

303
00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:47.200
work for me?
And I was like,
yeah,
I guess you would say.
He goes,

304
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:49.730
I don't care if you fail so fucking get high.

305
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.380
What was important to me to tell you is that you can't get fired.
Right.

306
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:56.270
That's what it was.
Nothing bad will happen.
Yeah.
You can't,
can't get fired.

307
00:16:56.630 --> 00:16:59.780
Your learning how to do this.
You'd only been doing it a couple of years.

308
00:16:59.781 --> 00:17:02.000
You're writing jokes,
you're trying to shit out.
I'm like,

309
00:17:02.001 --> 00:17:06.180
just go up there and have some fun,
be you.
But I was not how the tolerance,
uh,

310
00:17:06.181 --> 00:17:08.040
you were at [inaudible] and I go,
oh,

311
00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:10.730
they beat me in the second show by the second show,

312
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:15.870
the first show I would were on fire on the second show though.
You were on fire.

313
00:17:15.871 --> 00:17:17.390
Yeah,
I remember that.

314
00:17:17.391 --> 00:17:20.210
Because you had gotten into this like crazy place where you like,

315
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.870
when you get high,
there's this point in the beginning where you're like,
ah,

316
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.920
it's dangerous.
The danger zone.
I'm skiing.
That'll that that'll make you,
yeah,

317
00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:30.110
exactly.
You skiing,
you're going down a mountain

318
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:34.370
and that's what makes you leave parties early.
You gotta,

319
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:38.150
you gotta overcome the danger zone.
Woo.
And then it takes you into what?

320
00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:42.920
Then you get into this introspective w really articulates zone,

321
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:47.830
get into an area where you're more articulate than you are when you're not cool.

322
00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.030
I think it's over the,
over the top of the mountain.
So then you're like,
okay,

323
00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:54.540
I know that's as high as I was going to get.
Yeah,
that's hosting.
No,
I'm coasting.

324
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:57.630
I'm not scared anymore.
Yeah,
yeah.
That's exactly what it is.

325
00:17:57.631 --> 00:18:01.460
You get to this weird point where you're,
you're,
you're kind of,
you're,

326
00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:05.130
you're comfortable with the state and then you can kind of relax and also the

327
00:18:05.131 --> 00:18:08.930
effects of the THC of diminished they'll,
they'll diminish over an hour.

328
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.280
That first part is 30 minutes.
For me it was,

329
00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.970
it was two and a half hours cause I was slaughter than that man.

330
00:18:14.971 --> 00:18:16.790
Sometimes you're high the next day.
Oh yeah,

331
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:19.650
you like a cookie or something like that and you could easily be high the next

332
00:18:19.650 --> 00:18:23.180
day.
My friend Aaron got me high in college on the unkind bud.
Do you ever,

333
00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.970
do you have kind bud when you are not,
that's just not real.
What does that mean?

334
00:18:26.971 --> 00:18:30.640
Wait,
hold on.
What kind?
But mean just means good pot that's all met,

335
00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.440
which is good.
It's just there's this does just pot man.

336
00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:36.620
Here's what in kind bud there was sweat.

337
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.480
Todd Cormack.
Come on,
explain all of this.
He could he give me the guy,

338
00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:48.090
he's coming on soon.
Anyway,
he'll,
he'll come on,
he's doing some giant,

339
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.270
we'd expo in La.
He's going to promote.
Yeah,

340
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:55.570
but he could tell you the actual history.
Like he's an actual historian guy.

341
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.060
Bud guessing.
He actually went up that met Sativa,

342
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:03.720
Endeca or put this and go to bed.
I think just whack.
We'd,

343
00:19:03.721 --> 00:19:08.280
there's Mexican dirt weed to Shitty weed tie stuck.
Yeah,

344
00:19:08.310 --> 00:19:12.420
but it's all weed.
But he gave me some and I played golf with my grandma,

345
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.130
my aunt the next day and apply whole five.
I was like just coming down.

346
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.160
I realized when we're hitting the guard,
I remember,

347
00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.820
and she's a conservative person,

348
00:19:21.150 --> 00:19:24.510
her husband's a lawyer and like it's conservative.

349
00:19:24.511 --> 00:19:26.490
It's so that it's like once I realized I was high,
I was like,

350
00:19:26.491 --> 00:19:30.990
keep your mouth shut dude.
But if you get that wave right,

351
00:19:30.991 --> 00:19:34.960
like the other night Aubrey and I were playing pool and um,

352
00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.290
I don't really play that much anymore man.
I don't get a chance.

353
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:40.380
I don't play in tournaments anymore.
I don't get a chance to play too many.

354
00:19:40.381 --> 00:19:43.980
Like sometimes dom Arrera and I will get together or Greg Fitzsimmons plays

355
00:19:43.981 --> 00:19:44.814
pretty good.
We'll get together,

356
00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:47.580
you play pretty good and we'll get together and knocks the balls around.

357
00:19:47.581 --> 00:19:51.030
But I'm not like playing like real players.
I can tournaments anymore.

358
00:19:51.450 --> 00:19:52.261
And so I think,

359
00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:56.700
but every now and then like you get high and you remember what to do if you can

360
00:19:56.701 --> 00:20:01.290
remember how to do it.
The other day I got in,
I got in the zone for like five,

361
00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:03.330
six shots in a row.
I started like,

362
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:06.540
I started running out like this table I should getting out over and over and

363
00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:07.050
over again.

364
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:09.930
In a way that I really shouldn't be able to do because I'm really not practicing

365
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:13.530
that much,
but I just got into the zone.
It was very temporary.
I couldn't hold it,

366
00:20:13.531 --> 00:20:15.450
but I knew it was all the weed.
I knew it.

367
00:20:15.451 --> 00:20:17.070
I know I know how to play pool a little bit,

368
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.180
but I'm in this crazy sensitive zone where I know how to control that ball

369
00:20:21.181 --> 00:20:23.340
better.
It's two ways it could hit you.

370
00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:27.210
I do on basketball and sometimes in basketball it's like someone will throw you

371
00:20:27.211 --> 00:20:30.090
a pass and Walton the area go,
okay,
what am I options here?

372
00:20:30.091 --> 00:20:34.590
When this ball gets to me,
I got him cutting.
I could pass to him,
I could shoot,

373
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:37.890
I could pass it back and it's like,
all right,
I'm ready.
I think I'm right,

374
00:20:37.891 --> 00:20:40.530
and then the ball comes to you at other times that Paul just hits you in the

375
00:20:40.531 --> 00:20:41.364
face.

376
00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:50.590
Sorry.
Got It.
There was like,
why are you buying high?
It's so true.

377
00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.750
So true.
Yet that's the same with Jujitsu as well.
Oh yeah,
absolutely.

378
00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:01.300
People love smoking pot and doing Jujitsu too because I think it makes you like

379
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.450
focus makes you focus on what you're doing rather than like being uncomfortable

380
00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:07.474
with what you're doing,

381
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:12.050
let's you like really just be in the moment in some strange way.
It doesn't.

382
00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:15.910
That's counterintuitive for people that are in the store to pot couldn't help

383
00:21:15.911 --> 00:21:19.270
you.
Yeah.
It's also like what we would do when we were,

384
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:22.900
when we were doing that and we'd get really high and go on stage we were doing

385
00:21:22.901 --> 00:21:27.250
was I was like,
I know that when we get really high and we sit around and talk,

386
00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:29.920
we have some of the funnier things.
Yeah.

387
00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:34.270
It's fun at a riff on that when you're high.
Yes.
Don't matter.

388
00:21:34.271 --> 00:21:36.790
Sets the comedy store good.
Your high where it's like,

389
00:21:36.791 --> 00:21:39.640
let me just tell you a joke and then you just think of something ridiculous on

390
00:21:39.641 --> 00:21:43.810
top of it.
Like you talk about fucking flying giraffe,
pussy people.
Yeah.

391
00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.800
Those don't come out unless you're stoned,
so once in a while you need that.

392
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.390
But if you're doing a showcase,
if you're like,

393
00:21:49.391 --> 00:21:50.650
here's the exact set I want to run.

394
00:21:50.651 --> 00:21:54.550
Then it's not the greatest thing in the world to do.
Yeah,
well it's,
yeah,

395
00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.120
sometimes it's not right.
It's easy.

396
00:21:56.121 --> 00:22:00.510
Asked me before he takes his special a couple of years ago actually,
what does,

397
00:22:00.550 --> 00:22:04.600
what does,
what do you do for weed?
I was like,
I smoked like two hours before,

398
00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.480
hour and a half before and you know,
let it,
let it tape it off.

399
00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:11.800
Don't risk having a too high that time,
but yeah,

400
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.740
could be danger.
But if you get past that and you get to that calm spot,

401
00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:22.600
then you real it.
Yeah man.
That's like,
that's where a lot of comedy comes from,

402
00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:23.380
which is,

403
00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.920
which is sold the really bad bill of goods and his country when it comes to

404
00:22:26.921 --> 00:22:30.310
marijuana and it just automatically associated with people that are lazy

405
00:22:30.610 --> 00:22:34.450
automatically associated people that are dumb and so smoked more than ever.
Yeah.

406
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.890
I have two specials that I show this year.
It's only the first quarter.

407
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.540
It's not bad.
It's,
it makes you,
it makes you more aware,

408
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.720
makes you more sensitive and that,
that also brings the paranoia.

409
00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:50.380
But I knew that like,
you know,
if you just got used to doing it,

410
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:54.440
you would love it.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Especially when you're fucking around on.

411
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.340
I go back and apologize to the people you shit on for smoking pot.

412
00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.060
They would go like,
Oh man who they were.
Yeah.

413
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.660
I wonder what was people that were already like failing.
That was the problem.

414
00:23:04.661 --> 00:23:07.210
The people that I knew that were smoking pot all the time,

415
00:23:07.211 --> 00:23:09.070
but you weren't doing anything with their lives.

416
00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.900
I didn't know anybody that was like Joey Diaz.
Ralphie,
people like that.

417
00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.110
People that were smoking around the store where their pot smokers back then.

418
00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:20.050
Well I definitely didn't smoke pot when I first met Joey.

419
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.560
Cause when Joey used to hang around the,
uh,
he did not smoke pot.

420
00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:27.580
He definitely smoked pot,
but he ramped it up quite a bit.

421
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.410
I mean he really ramped it up quite a bit when it became more and more aware,
uh,

422
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:35.770
available in the 90s,
the late nineties and the early two thousands,

423
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:39.340
like right when I started smoking,
he had already ramped it up.
You know,

424
00:23:39.341 --> 00:23:40.810
he was ramping it up like he was,

425
00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.320
he was getting fucking cookies from people back then and he quit and he quit the

426
00:23:45.321 --> 00:23:46.154
coke.

427
00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:48.980
<v 1>So it's like going to fill in the,
I don't think so.
I don't think so.</v>

428
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.010
I think it was,
it was much later.
Oh,
really?
Ramped it up.

429
00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:54.740
We were good friends during the coke days.
Yeah.

430
00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.500
Joey and I were real good friends during the coke days and it happened,

431
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:03.850
it happened like consecutively with the death of my friend Johnny who also,

432
00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:09.380
yeah,
also had a coke thing,
so I knew the coke thing.
I knew,

433
00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:13.940
I knew what it was like to be around those guys.
And uh,
wasn't the same time?
No,

434
00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.250
no it was,
you know,
Joey was high long before then and then,

435
00:24:18.251 --> 00:24:19.610
and then the coke thing went,
like,

436
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.580
he went back and forth like into the time where I was already smoking weed.

437
00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:26.210
I remember Joey in some city,
Boston,
Philly,

438
00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:27.740
something like that world driving there with Kik.

439
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.420
I saw these like 18 year old kids like walking in front of our car to the

440
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:36.210
shoulder where and like,
you know,
flying monkey or whatever you call it,
what it,

441
00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:39.260
what does it talk about your time,
higher primates shirts.
Yeah.
Stuff like that.

442
00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.300
And I was like,
oh,
the go to the show.

443
00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.080
And then as they passed onto the driver's ideas like Hong Kong and they honk and

444
00:24:45.081 --> 00:24:47.000
they hit,
they turn,
they seed the,
I was like,
well,

445
00:24:47.001 --> 00:24:49.340
we're going to the show right now.
And he's like,
we get there,
like,

446
00:24:49.341 --> 00:24:53.270
we got these cookies.
He just grabs one.
It does it in his mouth and they're like,

447
00:24:53.271 --> 00:24:57.890
oh my God.
Then he just drove off
for those kids.

448
00:24:57.891 --> 00:25:01.790
That's probably one of the coolest things ever.
Yeah.
Joey Diaz,
man,

449
00:25:02.090 --> 00:25:03.980
he was another one.
Like I,
when I,

450
00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:08.300
when I first met him and I started hanging out with them.
Yeah.
You know,

451
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.670
I immediately we started,
we started working together.

452
00:25:10.671 --> 00:25:15.380
I think Joey and I did sets in the nineties really for real.
We did like,

453
00:25:15.381 --> 00:25:18.560
I think we did rascals in New York and New Jersey Rather.

454
00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.230
I think we did that shit in there like the late nineties we started going on the

455
00:25:21.231 --> 00:25:24.020
road together.
Like whenever he came to town,
whenever it was,

456
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.640
I was taking him on the road.
Him loved him.
I loved him.

457
00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.400
I just knew that this guy,

458
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:36.650
I knew like if everybody could see this guy,
the way I see this guy like to me,

459
00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:39.140
he's just,
he was just a joy.
That's cool.

460
00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.650
He was just this guy who would come around and he would freak people out because

461
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:44.960
he was really big back then and he looked like a football player.

462
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:50.210
He was probably like 230 to 40 meters near that.
Well,
he was,

463
00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:52.900
I don't,
I don't,
I don't know.
I don't even want to guess how cause Joe,

464
00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:57.350
he's a big guy.
Joe,
he's about six foot tall and he's very wide.
You know,

465
00:25:57.351 --> 00:26:01.250
he's got that thick,
like Cuban build.
He's a thick fucker.

466
00:26:01.251 --> 00:26:02.720
Like before he was overweight,

467
00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:06.650
crammed in like a Cuban sandwich in any dangerous air about him.

468
00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:10.400
He was like a dangerous dude.
He had just left the life.
Yeah.
I mean,

469
00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:15.460
he had been in prison just a few years prior and because I spent so much time

470
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:20.570
hanging around pools when I lived in New Jersey and New York rather,
I,

471
00:26:20.571 --> 00:26:24.700
um,
I liked those guys.
You've got draws more from that.
Guys are fun.
Right?

472
00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.210
They're fun guys to hang around with.

473
00:26:26.211 --> 00:26:30.020
Those guys were laughing at shit and they were,
they were always the guys.
I mean,

474
00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:33.950
there was always trouble.
Like,
you know,
I've,
I've been around Joey snapping,

475
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:37.120
not dudes and not where I was worried he might hit somebody with a bottle and

476
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.010
Joey gets fucking crazy.
I saw my friend Johnny,

477
00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:43.010
my friend Johnny who reminds me of Joey.
I saw him hit this guy in the head,

478
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:47.280
a coffee mug.
Fuck his head up.
Really?
Yeah.
He grabbed a coffee,

479
00:26:47.281 --> 00:26:50.640
but they got in some fight.
It was like,
oh,
it'd be around that kind of Shit,
man.

480
00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:53.640
I'll be good to know where the guy,
like Joey was like,

481
00:26:53.641 --> 00:26:58.050
he kept it together better than Johnny did.
Joey was Joey's smarter in some ways,

482
00:26:58.051 --> 00:27:02.850
like socially or aware of,
you know how he's coming off?
Joey,
just,

483
00:27:02.851 --> 00:27:06.000
you know,
he's just a wild motherfucker that lived a wild life,
but he's,

484
00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:09.930
I knew that he was like this great guy,
you know?
I was like,
this guy's like,

485
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:11.460
sometimes he's so special,

486
00:27:12.170 --> 00:27:15.840
like he's like one of my favorite human beings of all time because he's just so

487
00:27:15.841 --> 00:27:20.370
genuinely him.
You know?
Joey's doesn't have any airs about him.
He's not,

488
00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.620
he's not trying to pretend to be anybody and no,
you're right.

489
00:27:22.621 --> 00:27:24.450
He totally is not trying to be anything else.

490
00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:26.500
He figured out how to do it on stage.
Yeah.

491
00:27:26.730 --> 00:27:30.120
He was always the best at that being the exact same offstage onstage.
Yeah.

492
00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:33.660
He was the best of that where there was really no difference between those two

493
00:27:33.661 --> 00:27:36.630
characters.
Yeah.
So we started going on the road together,

494
00:27:36.631 --> 00:27:40.170
like right away when I heard he used to have a hard time for hauling him to man.

495
00:27:40.710 --> 00:27:43.670
There's a bunch of times,
the beginning I realized like,
wow,
this is like,

496
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:47.760
it was like that thought,
this is good.
I got to ramp it up,
but I'm like,
man,

497
00:27:47.761 --> 00:27:52.260
I can't half ass going on after this guy because he's so strong.
He's so strong.

498
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:56.600
He would go on these Lennar killer.
Yeah.
Oh my God.
People would tell me,
you know,

499
00:27:56.610 --> 00:27:57.480
like what's wrong with you?

500
00:27:57.481 --> 00:27:59.430
Like why are you taking Joe deals on the road with you?

501
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.150
Like do you want to follow that guy that would call him to teach people a lesson

502
00:28:03.151 --> 00:28:05.560
in towns?
They would,
yeah,
we're going to have Joey future for warrior.

503
00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.470
They did the fucking Kevin Meaney and Miami,

504
00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.410
Kevin Meeney at the Miami Improv properties like this prick.

505
00:28:10.411 --> 00:28:12.810
He's giving me a hard time.
I'm gonna fucking Book D is right in front of him.

506
00:28:12.811 --> 00:28:16.410
The guy who ran the place was nuts and he was Joey's friend and they were all

507
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.980
doing the Colombian marching and powder together and they were they and they sat

508
00:28:22.171 --> 00:28:26.670
that weekend up.
So Joey Diaz goes on into Cuban room.
Okay,
you're in Miami,

509
00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:31.620
Cuba.
Half of his act,
he doesn't span.
Okay.
I'm not kidding.

510
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:35.850
I'm not fucking kidding.
And I mean,
he does his one man show in Spanish.

511
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:40.290
You could have lit everyone in that room on fire and kicked him in the balls and

512
00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:42.800
they would still be laughing at them.
He was caught.

513
00:28:43.070 --> 00:28:47.580
He was crushing in a way that's like biblical,
like you don't get to see that.

514
00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.910
It's like these moments that happen,
they never get captured on film.

515
00:28:50.911 --> 00:28:55.820
It's like a 10 o'clock show on a Friday night in Miami and he's crushing in the

516
00:28:55.821 --> 00:28:57.150
room in a way where you,

517
00:28:57.151 --> 00:29:00.480
you got to step out of the room for a while just to catch your breath.
You know,

518
00:29:00.481 --> 00:29:04.770
you gotta watch it with the door half open so you could wheeze and breathe.

519
00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:10.650
And then they through Kevin Meeney on after him,
just like,
fuck you pants people.

520
00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:15.720
Yeah,
he's just the killing.
Yeah.
It's not in me.
He's a funny guy.

521
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.320
Funny Guy.
That's funny.
So back to my billboard.
So anyway,

522
00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:25.110
I knew even way,
way,
way,
way back then.
You know when you first started out.
Well,

523
00:29:25.111 --> 00:29:28.140
I knew just talking to him,
I'm like,
this is a smart dude.
Smart Dude.

524
00:29:28.170 --> 00:29:32.840
You're funny.
You're capable of making really good jokes sometimes.
Yeah.

525
00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.070
Like all you have to do is just keep going.
I just knew that.

526
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:40.430
And so to be your friend through this whole thing and to see you from,

527
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:42.040
you know,
your baby steps

528
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.190
<v 0>and stand up and trying to figure it out all the years he tried to get past the</v>

529
00:29:45.191 --> 00:29:46.024
store,

530
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.260
you know that opening to your podcast when you talked about your comedy central

531
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:52.900
special,
which is called pay regular,

532
00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:55.510
which is I'm so it's so,

533
00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:59.920
it's such a good special but it's so strong like what you did.
Um,

534
00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:04.900
because for the longest time you see you weren't getting passive paid regular

535
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:07.810
biggest fucking hurdle.
I had to get over like a long time.

536
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.640
It was way easier for me.

537
00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:13.300
I got in pretty quick because of the Todd [inaudible] and because I was already

538
00:30:13.301 --> 00:30:17.470
headline you or came in as a,
as developed guy.
I started there.
I was,
you know,

539
00:30:17.471 --> 00:30:21.430
I was still,
I sucked.
I was uh,
I had some shit.

540
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:23.290
I had some shit that would occasionally can,

541
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:25.510
I just hadn't figured out how to put it all together yet.

542
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.280
But the store is where I learned how to put it all together.
Oh really?
Yeah man.

543
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:31.660
Fuck Ya.
Yeah.

544
00:30:31.661 --> 00:30:34.870
I learned dude going on after Martin Lawrence in the main room on a fucking

545
00:30:34.871 --> 00:30:37.990
Saturday night when he was,
when he was doing what he was doing.

546
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:42.760
Those concert movies is in the moon,
man.
His shirt.
Yeah.
That one dude,

547
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:46.150
I followed leather,
the leather jumpsuit on.
I called him.

548
00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:51.430
He can't even say I ate it because there's just was no reaction.
You know,
people,

549
00:30:51.730 --> 00:30:54.550
Oh God,
it was just death.
That's the coolest thing.

550
00:30:54.551 --> 00:30:56.020
It's like headline shows over like,
no,

551
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:59.530
there's going to be for more young comics on who are just learning how to do

552
00:30:59.531 --> 00:31:03.070
comedy.
It's the worst environment.
Yeah.
I mean,
I guess I ate it,

553
00:31:03.071 --> 00:31:06.760
but eight is just not good enough.
Word ate it.
Like when you eat it,

554
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:11.110
you can eat it.
You can still kind of like half ass here.

555
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:15.480
There is way worse than ate it.
I ate,
I just,

556
00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:19.900
I just breathing air and F is a 55,
58,
you know,

557
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.700
I've got a 12.
It's like,
it's beyond them.
I've done fucking brought it up there.

558
00:31:24.701 --> 00:31:28.810
So,
um,
and I did that all the time.
I did that after dice.

559
00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.270
I used to do that after anyone that was any good.
I did it after Damon Wayans.

560
00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:38.350
I did it after.
That's what Mitzi would do.
She would just shove you on and I,

561
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:43.000
so I learned there and when you started coming up

562
00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:48.230
I just saw,
I just knew it.
I just knew it.
I'm like,
you could do it.
Yeah,

563
00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.280
you'll come hang out with the employee time to you came to that time were all

564
00:31:51.281 --> 00:31:54.730
the employees were do each other's jokes.
They'll like pick out of a hat.

565
00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:57.580
You get this guys too.
It was fun.
It everyone did when you were like,

566
00:31:57.581 --> 00:31:58.750
you were making fun of like certain people,

567
00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:01.420
like I've never seen this material that I've seen it.

568
00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:05.890
But you knew the other guys doing it.
Like you came from the employee time a lot.

569
00:32:06.010 --> 00:32:10.660
Yeah.
Well it's like I said,
you know,
we all think this dao,

570
00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.470
we all sort of share this,
this idea now that we're all just comics,
you know?

571
00:32:14.490 --> 00:32:18.400
And that's the beautiful thing about the store is that this is fraternity where

572
00:32:18.401 --> 00:32:21.340
there's guys that are part of it that are really just starting out.
Man.

573
00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.540
And there's other guys that had been around it for like Russell,

574
00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:27.400
that people thing that the story of these door guys who were like a lot of

575
00:32:27.401 --> 00:32:31.330
people that are like major professionals that we're all so door guys there were

576
00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:35.140
work,
the booth worked the phone.
So it's not like,
excuse me employee.
It's like,

577
00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:37.660
oh,
excuse me,
someone who was just like this friend of mine,

578
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:42.500
copper Roulo was a door.
I was a door guy.
Run as easy,
you know from the league.

579
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:45.290
These are people that like started fucking mopping on vomit.
Yeah.

580
00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.260
So then when you see the new guys mopping up vomit and I see them now fucking

581
00:32:48.261 --> 00:32:51.470
around with don bears late at night and really growing for the first time.

582
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:56.540
Do we pass this kid on the way back?
Who was with us?
Did you know?
Oh,

583
00:32:56.541 --> 00:32:59.300
red band.
We were coming back from uh,
the standard.

584
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:03.110
We've read man and Pete and this guy just left the store and I was laying eggs.

585
00:33:03.230 --> 00:33:07.940
I saw boobs.
Like what?
Like the girl took her boobs out.
I felt him

586
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.880
where it's like just now was in the back and he got this girl and then I

587
00:33:13.881 --> 00:33:16.420
remember like it's the degenerating of these,

588
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.170
it's sort of once you start with like as a beautiful pure kid,
you let,

589
00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:23.870
you're met with this awful degeneracy like w who are these people?

590
00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.730
What are they doing?

591
00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
The drugs and the fucking and the different like depravity did site and then you

592
00:33:31.221 --> 00:33:33.260
just get changed.
I remember some waitress may,

593
00:33:33.290 --> 00:33:37.130
some really beautiful like Latino veal fin and like real pure look.

594
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.480
And I was sitting the,
the uh,
the open mic,
her's and someone was yelling.

595
00:33:41.481 --> 00:33:44.090
I was like,
shut the fuck up or I'll kick you out.
No more warnings.

596
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:48.230
And She just goes,
you've changed.
And it does change is all from this kid.

597
00:33:48.231 --> 00:33:52.460
It never felt a boob before.
The idea that he could feel some tea girl's tits,

598
00:33:52.461 --> 00:33:55.700
what people are watching and laughing.
So it just,

599
00:33:55.701 --> 00:33:59.010
it makes you a comic to darkness in the room.
Yeah.

600
00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:04.490
Dragged you into it.
It's dry as hell.
It invites you in and then says,

601
00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.010
I'll give you the option.
Do you want to take the pill?
Do you want to leave?
Well,

602
00:34:07.011 --> 00:34:07.844
it also liked,

603
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:12.530
I think there's echoes of the 80s with Sam Kinison did to that place back in the

604
00:34:12.531 --> 00:34:16.160
crazy wild coke days when he was the number one comic in the world.
And you know,

605
00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:20.170
anybody would come to see shows and we do these midnight spots and you know

606
00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.960
those days like that craziness of that time,

607
00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:26.090
all those crazy fucked up people on their drugs.
The Echo's,

608
00:34:26.091 --> 00:34:28.680
we're still like running through that building.
Yeah,
you're right.

609
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:32.150
People are still like returning and then it would be getting more people

610
00:34:32.151 --> 00:34:35.180
returning.
That's just an excuse to use the word,
but yet

611
00:34:37.050 --> 00:34:40.190
it has the right time.
Right time to throw it out there.

612
00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.490
First Time I heard but get,
oh sorry,
go ahead.
No,

613
00:34:43.491 --> 00:34:47.000
it's not been good at some begins
in begins is from,

614
00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.400
it's from the sentence anyway,
go ahead.

615
00:34:49.430 --> 00:34:53.480
So you went through this long development period,

616
00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:57.700
you did it mostly at the store and then on the road,
you know,

617
00:34:57.701 --> 00:35:01.430
and we would do gigs together.
Yeah,
it was,
you saw the whole thing though.

618
00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.760
I mean from the beginning,
that road stuff was super instrumental.

619
00:35:04.761 --> 00:35:08.420
Being able to spread my wings and be like,
oh,
okay,
here's what it is.

620
00:35:08.421 --> 00:35:12.650
Here's what I've been learning for.
It's not just sparring.
Yeah,
yeah.

621
00:35:12.710 --> 00:35:15.800
That's something I never got from anybody else.
No,

622
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:19.550
I never really had that opportunity to have some helpful with me.

623
00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.750
And you can see what better comedy is on a night to night basis and see beyond

624
00:35:23.751 --> 00:35:25.940
just what your jokes are than how you're doing.
Um,
and you know,

625
00:35:25.941 --> 00:35:27.800
when you go after a Heckler,
when you don't,

626
00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.840
and that was the best thing about learning at the store too.

627
00:35:29.841 --> 00:35:33.770
You see these great comics,
you see Paul Mooney command a stage and you're like,

628
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:34.940
oh,
how does he do that?

629
00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:39.630
You don't get to just watch once you get to watch 45 times in three months and

630
00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:41.910
you start to understand it to work.
They're like,
you did.

631
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:43.980
It's an unbelievable education.
I mean,

632
00:35:43.981 --> 00:35:46.830
that's what happened with Eleanor [inaudible],
Eleanor Kerrigan,

633
00:35:46.831 --> 00:35:49.770
our friend who was a waitress there forever.
She wasn't a comic,

634
00:35:49.771 --> 00:35:54.450
but she was hilarious and she was also a great judge of talent.

635
00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.120
Like if some dude was in from out of town and I would go,
how is it?

636
00:35:57.121 --> 00:36:00.870
And she'd be like,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

637
00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.340
Heck she would go like,
she would nail it,
you know,
she would go,

638
00:36:05.370 --> 00:36:08.400
he's fucking funny.
You gotta Watch this guy's fucking funny.

639
00:36:08.401 --> 00:36:12.030
And if Alan were told me that I was sitting down right,
I'm like,
great,

640
00:36:12.031 --> 00:36:14.270
this guy's going to be really good luck too.
It's up.
Yeah.

641
00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.020
She would call like managers and agents tell them like they had this person for

642
00:36:17.021 --> 00:36:21.900
real.
She's awesome.
So nice to see her doing stand up.
But so you were,

643
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.350
you went through all this struggle and then over the last few years,

644
00:36:25.351 --> 00:36:29.550
everything is fucking taken off.
You have a comedy central specials.

645
00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:31.440
You sold your last special condoms.

646
00:36:31.441 --> 00:36:34.560
There's this Friday is this Friday at midnight on comedy central?

647
00:36:35.370 --> 00:36:38.010
Midnight Eastern,
I think 11 and 10 other times though,

648
00:36:38.070 --> 00:36:41.790
and you can buy it right now,
there's a banner should be up really soon.

649
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:45.420
Right route or the great.com you can get it for pay what I'm doing.

650
00:36:45.421 --> 00:36:49.110
Pay What you want.
Pay What the good songs y'all do with dollar.
That's cool.

651
00:36:49.170 --> 00:36:52.590
Their system,
but fuck it.
I love it.
Yeah.

652
00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:57.840
So all this has happened over the last few years and you get this comedy
central,

653
00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:01.080
the show that you're on the show,
the homeowner's Day,
Thursday night.

654
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.780
This is not happening.
And there's a billboard and does not.

655
00:37:06.781 --> 00:37:09.450
Ari's idea he didn't ask for this.

656
00:37:09.570 --> 00:37:14.570
There's a billboard above his old fucking apartment and the billboard above your

657
00:37:15.361 --> 00:37:19.710
old fucking parlor is that this is not happening with you,

658
00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.090
bro.
Fun.
I have picture of me.
Fuck an eagle.
Yeah,
this is America.

659
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:30.990
W w what you are in that picture on my Instagram.

660
00:37:30.991 --> 00:37:33.510
Look at that picture because you can see them and you can see the window of my

661
00:37:33.511 --> 00:37:36.030
old,
of my old apartment.
Look at that picture.

662
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:40.080
That's one of my favorite pictures of all time.
Look at that fucking picture,
man.

663
00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:43.950
You're so happy you did it.
That is,

664
00:37:43.951 --> 00:37:48.200
that's officially you did it was that last night anyway.
Oh,

665
00:37:48.330 --> 00:37:52.590
I mean if you go off the wall crazy and uh,

666
00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:56.760
jump off a fucking building.
I had a billboard in my,
yeah,
it's pretty,

667
00:37:56.880 --> 00:37:59.340
I don't know.
I've gotten so much.
People are so much more excited about this.

668
00:37:59.341 --> 00:38:03.330
Then the show or the special will,
the show's awesome.
You know,

669
00:38:03.331 --> 00:38:05.010
shows awesome.
It's great.

670
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:10.160
But there's something so nutty about the visual of that billboard above her old

671
00:38:10.201 --> 00:38:14.340
apartment.
The fact that it's right there is so god damn crazy.

672
00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.370
That's your fucking apartment.
Look at that.
Where my head is sticking out.

673
00:38:17.371 --> 00:38:20.580
That's mine.
That's my bedroom window.
This is insane.

674
00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:23.670
This is like some real weird simulation shit

675
00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.680
that's so fucking weird.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
You wouldn't see in a movie.

676
00:38:28.681 --> 00:38:30.000
You'd be like,
no fucking way.

677
00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:34.610
I've never been happier for someone else likes that.

678
00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:38.980
Then this happen to you.
I've never been happier.
It's,
it's amazing to see,
dude.

679
00:38:38.981 --> 00:38:43.630
It's so cool.
It's so fucking cool.
It's wild.

680
00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:47.210
Does that,
that doesn't even seem like,
like again,
if that was in a movie,

681
00:38:47.211 --> 00:38:50.630
you'd be like,
come on.
They put a fucking billboard right next to me.

682
00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.230
You'd be like,
no.
Hey Man.
Come on.
Make it down the street.

683
00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:56.680
That would still be something.
Yeah.
And it would be like a conspiracy theory.

684
00:38:56.710 --> 00:39:00.460
Oh he fucking course he told them he wanted the billboard above his old

685
00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:03.390
apartment.
It's,
it's the comedy central bill.

686
00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:06.340
But they bought it like five years ago and they've been putting stuff up there

687
00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:10.450
by the way,
you lived there way before that before that.

688
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:15.220
Exactly that.
But man it sucked.
Also walk under it going like fuck,

689
00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:20.570
I'll show billboard.
I wish I could get one one day.
That's hard man.
But listen,

690
00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.870
everyone's listening right now.
Set Your dvrs were 12th.

691
00:39:22.871 --> 00:39:26.860
There's two episodes left of that is not happening.
1230 on Thursday nights.

692
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:30.700
Rogan's on this one and you can see as big fun youtube right now and set your

693
00:39:30.701 --> 00:39:32.080
DVR for um,

694
00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:36.160
passive aggressive on Friday at midnight because if everybody watched it and

695
00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:38.050
dvrs is the first time they've run it a bunch of more.

696
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:40.030
So that first time is really important.

697
00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:43.390
How much did they know about dvrs and get the info,

698
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:46.840
the info when people recording.
Wow,
that's interesting.

699
00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.810
So all you freaks out there,
weird shit on your DVR.

700
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.150
They're playing my other one a lot more now cause everybody fucking washed it.

701
00:39:52.151 --> 00:39:54.200
Thank you guys for fucking watching and Dvr it.
Yeah.

702
00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:58.390
Oh that looks at the first one comes in.
Hmm.
Then they're super happy with it.

703
00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:01.320
So wonder if you have someone you DVR and you play it more than once.

704
00:40:01.321 --> 00:40:02.780
If they know you're playing it more than once.

705
00:40:02.781 --> 00:40:05.920
So I don't know if it means that if you went to watch it for them to register or

706
00:40:05.921 --> 00:40:09.490
just DVR it.
Yeah.
Right.
Everyone right now help me out.

707
00:40:09.491 --> 00:40:11.500
Just DVR both those things right now.

708
00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:14.620
What if we found out that if you teach DVR and watch it,

709
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.700
the Dutch just runs up the number and then we get these Chinese people would

710
00:40:17.730 --> 00:40:20.330
have like watch all day.
Yeah,
you just have,
you know,

711
00:40:20.331 --> 00:40:23.670
it just gigantic rooms would be help for them because they wouldn't know what it

712
00:40:23.671 --> 00:40:25.840
meant dvrs and just kept telling him to keep pressure.

713
00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:30.840
Pete press play and you just giant Bank of people making like 5 cents an hour.

714
00:40:31.810 --> 00:40:34.650
All these trying to shave off like,
you know,
we can program something for you.

715
00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:37.730
Like no,
shut up.
Mining DVR hits

716
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:43.660
already should fear the number one television show.

717
00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.950
Human history.
Everyone with the DVR watches it.

718
00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:51.730
They scientifically shown like why?
Yeah,
just keep it.
Yeah.

719
00:40:52.270 --> 00:40:56.820
Run his diet factory orange bears sweatshop.
I wonder how it works.
Um,

720
00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.320
so I didn't know if they knew how to check.

721
00:40:59.321 --> 00:41:01.150
If people do get the numbers like a few days,

722
00:41:01.151 --> 00:41:04.690
I get the first numbers and they get the second number is what are the numbers

723
00:41:04.691 --> 00:41:06.070
like for like satellite TV.

724
00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:08.470
Can they tell how many people were watching what shows?

725
00:41:08.471 --> 00:41:11.800
And when people have an issue with that,
right?
People don't want to get labeled.

726
00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:14.710
They don't want,
yeah.
So I watch Fox News 23 hours a day.

727
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:17.260
It doesn't mean I want to kill the president.
Right.
They don't get labeled.

728
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:20.050
But here's the problem.
So I,
I fucking signed into my,

729
00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:25.330
saw something through a server or something and my youtube thinks I'm Mexican.

730
00:41:25.331 --> 00:41:28.690
Now what?
Yeah,
all the commercials are in Spanish.

731
00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:33.920
It's always offering me fucking taco pickup trucks,
Taco,
all that shit,

732
00:41:33.921 --> 00:41:37.610
bro.
It totally dance about not,
not like a jokey things,
not Spanish.

733
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:41.480
It thinks I live in Mexico.
Why or Spain or something.

734
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:44.300
It's only given me fucking Spanish commercials.

735
00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:49.070
There's probably a preference settings.
[inaudible] made I Saturday night.

736
00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:52.030
I'm getting ads for that all the time after this is over young Jamie,

737
00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.610
we'll sort that.
Yeah,
maybe we've got a log around.

738
00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:56.960
He'll find out what the fuck is up with it.
I'm sure there's something.

739
00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:00.770
You just missed your stone stupor.
It's been cool though,
man.

740
00:42:00.771 --> 00:42:02.540
People show up to my shows now and they're like,

741
00:42:02.541 --> 00:42:07.370
I saw the show or I saw your stand up instead of like,
you know,
and it's nice to,

742
00:42:07.371 --> 00:42:10.070
people know me from podcasts or the amazing race was nice too,
but it's like,

743
00:42:10.071 --> 00:42:13.910
that's like,
oh,
that's what I do.
That's what I want you to see me from.
Yeah.

744
00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.940
From my stand up from preparing and developing material and they like it.

745
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.680
Yeah.
Yeah.
They just had to know that's a,

746
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:23.480
that's a big thing that's going on right now.

747
00:42:23.481 --> 00:42:25.250
It's like you just have to know about someone.

748
00:42:25.490 --> 00:42:28.210
Like sometimes people look get the chance to watch.
Yeah.

749
00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:30.230
So this is really funny guys.
You just don't know about it.

750
00:42:30.231 --> 00:42:32.870
But if people knew about him,
it's not that the product's not there,

751
00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:37.230
it's just the delight.
It's awkward to figure out the delivery device.

752
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.290
You remember the first time when you were 14 year old,

753
00:42:39.291 --> 00:42:44.030
the first time you like you found out about siren.
I live and you were like,

754
00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:46.520
cause it's made for 14 to 23 year olds.

755
00:42:46.521 --> 00:42:48.650
But at the time it was really great and you're like,

756
00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:52.910
I didn't know TV could be this funny this out.
They're like,
this is amazing.

757
00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:55.190
But it was just as good the week before you knew about it.

758
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.590
You just hadn't been made aware.
Right.

759
00:42:57.591 --> 00:43:01.610
And it's this thing you would've loved if you just gave us a chance or just

760
00:43:01.611 --> 00:43:04.190
turned it on.
Or just had your mom be out of town so he can stay up late.

761
00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:07.100
Like you find it in about a new band or something and then you go back and

762
00:43:07.101 --> 00:43:08.730
listen to the old stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.

763
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:10.900
There's always going to be something like that.
So always,

764
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:13.730
but that's with stand up comedy,
you know,

765
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:18.760
I think it's kind of important for everybody that's involved in it to like keep

766
00:43:19.221 --> 00:43:22.060
helping and supporting young comics.
Keep,

767
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.390
keep encouraging young comics because one of the reasons why standup is in like

768
00:43:26.391 --> 00:43:29.720
a really good place right now is a lot of people that go to comedy clubs and

769
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.030
shows her being real successful.
It's because there's so many funny guys.
Right.

770
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:34.850
That's what it is.
It's not that you don't,

771
00:43:34.851 --> 00:43:37.340
you don't want to be the only one person doing it.
No.

772
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:41.480
You want me to get a full good show?
Well you also want a giant industry.

773
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:45.920
You want to a giant more people go sit calmly.
They enjoy it.
It's fun for us.

774
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:49.640
Look here at top.
Never hurt comedy.
No carrot top is not my,

775
00:43:49.770 --> 00:43:52.100
although I'll be honest,
the carrot top is my taste.

776
00:43:52.101 --> 00:43:55.670
It's so fucking silly and dumb.
It's funny.
Yeah,
I don't mind that at all,

777
00:43:55.671 --> 00:43:56.960
but whenever we're shooting on carrot top,

778
00:43:57.210 --> 00:44:00.170
it least it means people are going out to comedy and they're like,
oh,

779
00:44:00.171 --> 00:44:00.861
stand up is funny.

780
00:44:00.861 --> 00:44:04.490
And then maybe they'll discover this stuff that really into way more specific to

781
00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:08.300
where maybe that's like their speed they liked on talking with those to yeah,

782
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.600
I think that uh,

783
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.680
it's super important that we is encouraged more people do it as much as positive

784
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:18.410
women,
regulars or clubs now on the road to people that go like four or five,

785
00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:20.470
10 times a year or two to a comedy club where it's,

786
00:44:20.471 --> 00:44:22.670
it's a good day and it's a bit,
it's like a movie and it's better,

787
00:44:22.671 --> 00:44:26.900
more real than a movie.
If you go see Sikora Dina and full Toronto,

788
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:30.780
me and you and you know,
if you know that someone that you really think is funny,

789
00:44:30.781 --> 00:44:33.210
he's going to be in town.
This is going to be a great time.

790
00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.220
I used to get my friend from DC,
Avi Lerner,

791
00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:40.620
he used to ask me DC Improv lineup.
He'd look at him like,

792
00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.160
is there anybody I should see?
I shouldn't see like he was like,

793
00:44:44.161 --> 00:44:47.700
it's time to go out to it to a good date,
you know,
until you'd be like,
oh,

794
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:50.220
avoid that guy.
He's super hacky.
I don't know these two.

795
00:44:50.221 --> 00:44:53.160
And that guy is actually pretty good.
And he's like,
cool.
Yeah.

796
00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:55.890
You just want to know who the good ones are.
Yeah.
That's the thing,

797
00:44:55.891 --> 00:45:00.891
because we all know once you're stuck listening to some crazy contrived like,

798
00:45:02.110 --> 00:45:03.060
oh,
I gotta get Outta here.

799
00:45:03.090 --> 00:45:06.480
Or like if you're not into those hypnotists and you go to the hypnotist week and

800
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:10.530
you're like,
fuck,
why did I go to this?
Yeah.

801
00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:15.540
I just think it's one of those art forms that needs a help from the people that

802
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:18.630
do it.
And I think the more the people that do it help,

803
00:45:18.810 --> 00:45:21.450
the more more people do it.
Like,
I mean,
I'm,

804
00:45:21.451 --> 00:45:25.710
I'm meeting dudes on the road all the time now that started doing open mic

805
00:45:25.711 --> 00:45:27.470
nights.
Weird huck cast.
Yeah.

806
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.780
That's why it's so weird when Dane Cook says people like comics stole his

807
00:45:30.781 --> 00:45:34.980
essence and it's like,
Oh Dang,
you were super influential.
Comic Book.

808
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.830
Steven Wright was the same way.
You like,

809
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:41.610
you brought physical comedy into the mainstream where people started doing it

810
00:45:41.611 --> 00:45:44.250
more.
Bob Nelson was the last big physical comic.

811
00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:48.480
I don't know that all these guys were watching comedy when they were 1415 years

812
00:45:48.481 --> 00:45:53.370
old and now it's been 10 12 years and they're doing comedy and you're one of the

813
00:45:53.371 --> 00:45:56.370
guys they watch coming up.
Yeah.
So it's like,
yeah,

814
00:45:56.371 --> 00:46:00.900
of course they got into it because of you.
You can't,
and you want Jim Carey.
Yeah.

815
00:46:00.901 --> 00:46:04.860
You watched him caring.
So it's like you can't,
you everyone,
you know,

816
00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:09.840
there's that weird line when someone is influenced and when someone is
imitating.

817
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:12.370
Yeah.
And that's,
that's the weird line.
Yeah.

818
00:46:12.450 --> 00:46:16.080
It's like we're all influencing each other and we're all influenced by prior.

819
00:46:16.430 --> 00:46:20.580
Everyone should,
for once by Ozzy said he was influenced by the Beatles.
Yeah.

820
00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:22.230
And when you look at that,
you're like,
no way.
But you're like,

821
00:46:22.231 --> 00:46:24.360
there's something in there.
They're probably,
you know,
that you can't,

822
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:28.320
it's not a straight copy.
So you wouldn't think that.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I mean,

823
00:46:28.321 --> 00:46:32.160
it doesn't have to be a copy.
Influence means it's moves you in a certain way.

824
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:33.600
I'm influenced by music.

825
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:38.460
A lot of songs influenced me that they don't influence my,
my words,

826
00:46:38.490 --> 00:46:39.660
they don't influence my comedy,

827
00:46:39.661 --> 00:46:43.410
but they influenced my thinking positions the way they handle it to live music.

828
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:45.270
Yeah.
Wait a musician.
That's why I do it.

829
00:46:45.271 --> 00:46:46.770
Different tour should every year because iron maiden,

830
00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:51.210
Oh shit I made did that and I was like,
interesting.
I liked the way they,

831
00:46:51.211 --> 00:46:55.080
they way they close strong,
you know,
you can see that fucking,

832
00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.110
I dunno the way that you know,
certain great bands.
You're like,
oh,

833
00:46:58.111 --> 00:47:02.460
that was a good concert.
Yeah.
I want to mimic that.
Yeah.
Fuck yeah man.

834
00:47:03.090 --> 00:47:06.190
The few times that have gone to see a honey honey live.
Yeah.

835
00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:10.440
Like I love watching talent like Ben and Suzanne from honey,
honey.

836
00:47:10.441 --> 00:47:15.210
There's so God damn talented.
So,
and her voice is just ridiculously good.

837
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:18.330
I think that going to be at some festival and plying.
Yeah,

838
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:19.500
they were there in town.

839
00:47:19.501 --> 00:47:22.230
Right now we're bouncing phone calls back and forth to each other.

840
00:47:22.231 --> 00:47:23.940
I've got to get to get together with those guys.

841
00:47:23.970 --> 00:47:27.600
They're really nice and they're just stupid talented in a way that I don't

842
00:47:27.601 --> 00:47:30.370
understand.
Like I don't understand like music talent.
Yeah.
I can't sing.

843
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:32.200
So when I hear someone singing I'm like,
whoa,

844
00:47:32.201 --> 00:47:35.230
that was crazy and I want you to what you want with her fois.
Oh yeah.

845
00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.300
But also what makes someone command a stage.

846
00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:41.230
Like you can have like muse has this giant light show and everything.

847
00:47:41.231 --> 00:47:43.570
It's that I get,
you know,
um,

848
00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.180
flaming lips has all this confetti and shit and then I get,

849
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:49.750
but if it's just the people that are just playing the music and some kill it and

850
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:52.720
some don't,
it's like,
what's the difference?
Yeah.

851
00:47:52.820 --> 00:47:56.470
Has Been Nico Vega and we saw it hurt during the sunset shift festival once and

852
00:47:56.471 --> 00:47:58.570
it was like,
oh my gosh,
she's playing one of the,

853
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.960
they were playing one of the inside sales agents that have won a giant wants and

854
00:48:01.961 --> 00:48:06.250
it's like she's blown it out of the water and it's like,
how,
what are they doing?

855
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:08.800
Just jumping up around a lot,
like half of it.

856
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:12.610
All you gotta do is really love what you're doing.
Yeah.
There's definitely,

857
00:48:12.611 --> 00:48:15.220
that's a big part of smashing pumpkins or garbage.

858
00:48:15.221 --> 00:48:17.920
Now Billy Corgan is the only one left in the band.

859
00:48:18.190 --> 00:48:22.210
He hires an Asian basis to look like Jimmy [inaudible] or whatever his name is,

860
00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:26.710
a female guitarists to look like the old and then they just play all the old

861
00:48:26.711 --> 00:48:29.290
songs at double speed cause he fucking hates them now.
Wow.

862
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:33.220
He plays only as new stuff.
Regular speed.
He changed his lyrics.

863
00:48:33.221 --> 00:48:35.860
He's all Jesus out now.
Well that's got,

864
00:48:35.861 --> 00:48:40.420
it's empty just like you.
Really.
Yeah.

865
00:48:40.510 --> 00:48:44.490
What happened?
He cleared out the fucking in Columbus.
He cleared that place.

866
00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.740
He was headlining a festival day.
Bush killed it during the day.

867
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.670
It ain't about being old and then people just,
by the time I was like,
all right,

868
00:48:51.671 --> 00:48:53.860
we can leave.
It was half empty.
The place.

869
00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.340
Courtney love Courtney love rectum ruined them.
I don't know.

870
00:48:57.341 --> 00:49:00.190
He just doesn't want to play his music.
He didn't want that Super Pussy.

871
00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:02.740
Got To love what you're doing.
You know what super policy.
Yeah.

872
00:49:02.741 --> 00:49:05.830
She might to put these stolen Saudi love must've been.

873
00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:10.480
Of course she's probably still is.
People.
Scott Sprung over her dude.

874
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:11.440
I'll tell you what,
man,

875
00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:14.680
I don't know what influence he had over those whole songs,

876
00:49:15.250 --> 00:49:19.460
but some of those songs were fucking good.
Ballparks was amazing.
Yes.

877
00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:24.040
Our next album after that,
after the mountain doll parts,
which is piece of me,

878
00:49:24.041 --> 00:49:24.551
I forget,

879
00:49:24.551 --> 00:49:28.090
but the next one after that about the stolen raw water of la or whatever it was,

880
00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:32.140
that was a good album,
and I think that might've been the Billy Corgan album.

881
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.440
I don't know,
man,
who,
whoever the fuck was involved,

882
00:49:35.470 --> 00:49:37.900
they had some really good fucking songs.
Right?

883
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:41.620
Doesn't matter where she got it from.
She got it still,
whatever,
whoever,

884
00:49:41.621 --> 00:49:46.180
whatever the collaboration was,
but he was involved in some point in time.

885
00:49:47.110 --> 00:49:49.420
It's sad to see that he's losing his fucking marvels.

886
00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.760
I was trying to get her from my storyteller show.
Whoa,

887
00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.190
we want to put a musician on it.
That wouldn't be bad.

888
00:49:54.191 --> 00:49:56.440
I bet you'd have a good story or two.
Yeah,
for sure.

889
00:49:56.700 --> 00:50:00.760
If going nuts or 20 or 20 people that accused her,

890
00:50:00.761 --> 00:50:04.630
they were make documentaries accusing her of killing her husband.
Imagine that.

891
00:50:05.230 --> 00:50:08.980
Imagine if your husband committed suicide and there's people making

892
00:50:08.981 --> 00:50:12.340
documentaries and he to kill you of killing him when you know you didn't kill

893
00:50:12.341 --> 00:50:14.780
him.
Imagine going through life like that.
Yeah.

894
00:50:15.030 --> 00:50:17.440
Some of the wacky conspiracy shut up already.

895
00:50:17.441 --> 00:50:20.230
I've said how it's I was somewhere else,
you know,

896
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:23.790
or could you imagine if she killed him?
Him.
That's it.
Everybody.
Thanks.

897
00:50:23.800 --> 00:50:28.340
Come on doing it too
know,
but fuck man.

898
00:50:28.341 --> 00:50:32.030
To accuse someone of something like that.
It's so I heard a horrible loss.

899
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:36.290
Drops his baby and that sent him like he was already depressed and heroin doubt

900
00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.070
and then dropping her baby on heroin.
Is it?
Oh,
I'm a piece of shit.
Oh my God.

901
00:50:40.090 --> 00:50:43.970
Then it just like blew up.
Blew it off.
Oh my God.
That sounds like a good story.

902
00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.780
That's like one of those headless Horseman Type Story.
I heard

903
00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:53.030
he was alone.
If it's midnight in October and you look up and it's a full moon,

904
00:50:53.031 --> 00:50:57.380
you'll see the headless horseman.
It's true brown.
My uncle saw it,
bro.

905
00:50:58.500 --> 00:50:59.660
We,
we're in Utah.

906
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:03.140
We talked to these guys that told us that they saw you bulletproof wolf that

907
00:51:03.141 --> 00:51:07.010
appeared out of missed really [inaudible] guys had shot at it and that's how

908
00:51:07.011 --> 00:51:09.950
they knew it was bulletproof cause they always had these mother fuckers are

909
00:51:09.951 --> 00:51:14.240
shooting at imaginary wolves in the middle of Utah.
How good is their math?
Wow.

910
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.103
That's,
wow.

911
00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:20.180
That was just know I have some strong math along with some loneliness.

912
00:51:20.450 --> 00:51:24.680
Here's wanted,
know what meth feels like,
what heroin feels like.
Yeah,

913
00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:29.250
go ahead and coke.
I wanna I want to know what all that shit feels like.
Yeah.

914
00:51:29.251 --> 00:51:31.820
I just don't want to do it and have the ill effects of it.

915
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:35.630
I'm not interested in opiates for sure.
For sure.

916
00:51:35.631 --> 00:51:38.660
That's the one that takes a fry Yom and an opium den.
Oh,

917
00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:43.850
John Wayne or no,
it wasn't John Wayne through uh,
one of those fucking outlaws.

918
00:51:43.851 --> 00:51:47.000
Like wild bill Hitchcock or something like killing an opium den.
You didn't,
well,

919
00:51:47.010 --> 00:51:50.870
he just fucked him up.
He became an opium addict.
Was it him or was it,
um,

920
00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:56.390
who is the guy,
Kevin Wider I think later.
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,

921
00:51:56.391 --> 00:51:58.280
yeah.
I think I've heard that.
Yeah.

922
00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:01.670
I think a lot of the doc holiday was a dentist who gave him the opium.

923
00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.320
Oh my goodness.

924
00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:08.390
A lot of those dudes would like our visit.
Those,
they had Chinese,

925
00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:10.230
the Chinese people who,
uh,

926
00:52:10.370 --> 00:52:13.160
helped build the railroads are basically built the railroads.
Really,
man,

927
00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:14.840
you still a bunch of gold.
You've got a bunch of gold.

928
00:52:14.841 --> 00:52:17.690
Of course you can get into drugs.
He's 11:00 PM dens.

929
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.110
They probably wouldn't even illegal back then.
They probably were not illegal.

930
00:52:21.140 --> 00:52:21.500
Yeah,

931
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.170
probably people didn't have like the kind of laws they have now because we've

932
00:52:24.171 --> 00:52:28.040
got wild west palm wasn't illegal until the 1930s and psychedelics weren't

933
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:31.910
illegal until 1970 and they used to give cocaine like you were used to being

934
00:52:31.940 --> 00:52:33.770
coca cola.
Yeah.
Can you imagine if you,

935
00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:36.560
if you've come across some native Americans,
you're not in the wild west,

936
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.880
you know,
we're talking about 18,

937
00:52:37.881 --> 00:52:41.460
10 or something and you come around and they're not,
they're not violent.
They're,

938
00:52:41.461 --> 00:52:42.890
they take you in and they take care of their,

939
00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:45.980
their tent and they want to show you their ways and they feed you.

940
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:50.240
And they keep you this pipe and you're like,
oh that's,
that's this,
this is crazy.

941
00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:54.140
That's the peace pipe.
That's not the crazy,
the smell shit in it.
Yeah.

942
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:58.160
Can you imagine,
are there cups around,
you know,
is there a sheriff here?

943
00:52:58.161 --> 00:53:01.250
Cause he's going to throw me in jail for this.
I don't think they smoked opium.

944
00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.300
I think the peace pipe was that was a backhoe.
Oh really?
Just tobacco.

945
00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:09.830
That was marijuana.
I don't think so man.
When did,
where her want to start?

946
00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:14.450
I think marijuana.
I don't,
I mean they probably use it if they knew about it,

947
00:53:14.451 --> 00:53:19.390
if they had found it,
but I think they use tobacco a lot as well.
Wild tobacco.

948
00:53:19.391 --> 00:53:23.090
I think that will get you high.
Yeah.
Tobacco gets you in a weird way.

949
00:53:23.091 --> 00:53:25.980
I mean that's why guys like smoking cigars.
Find out what the fuck

950
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.170
<v 1>is in the peace pipe there,
Jamie.
It's gotta be,
uh,
some answers,</v>

951
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:31.320
but I don't think it's helped me smoke them to peace pipe.
No,

952
00:53:31.321 --> 00:53:34.860
I don't think it was [inaudible] or marijuana cause opiums not grown in the

953
00:53:34.861 --> 00:53:37.920
United States.
I don't think you can.
I think it's gotta be like South America.

954
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.530
Oh really?
Yeah.
I don't think you can grow it here.

955
00:53:40.560 --> 00:53:44.340
I think he grow in Afghanistan and I think you can grow it in some climates and

956
00:53:44.341 --> 00:53:47.310
South America or something like that.
I've heard,
I have no idea what it is.

957
00:53:47.311 --> 00:53:51.770
It's one of those things like,
like how the fuck can they not grow cocaine?

958
00:53:51.790 --> 00:53:54.990
The United States,
they keep saying they import cocaine.
Yeah.
I said,
wait,
wait,

959
00:53:54.991 --> 00:53:59.970
wait.
We,
we have these hydroponic
grow it here.

960
00:54:00.150 --> 00:54:05.010
It's like there's not plants that don't grow in certain geographic locations are

961
00:54:05.011 --> 00:54:08.850
there?
Yeah.
But then you could grow them inside when you did,

962
00:54:08.851 --> 00:54:12.100
you could manipulate the environment to simulate like a South American rain

963
00:54:12.101 --> 00:54:16.080
forest.
We just wouldn't be as good.
Like,
like grapes need to be on,
uh,
on,
uh,

964
00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.020
have the sun hitting in most of the days they need to be on like an incline.

965
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:21.900
Oh really?
What does that Kinda connects?

966
00:54:21.901 --> 00:54:26.400
Just the plant native American smoking product typically made it a mixture of

967
00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:30.150
various leaves or barks with other plant materials.
Whoa.

968
00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:35.310
So they just work.
So it was just bark and shit.

969
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:40.530
Wow.
Hmm.
Okay.
Tobacco.

970
00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:42.950
So they did some eastern tribes.

971
00:54:42.951 --> 00:54:44.790
It wasn't dropped off from mixed it with other herbs.

972
00:54:44.791 --> 00:54:48.730
Barks and plant matter and a preparation,
commonly known as [inaudible].

973
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:52.610
<v 2>Cuny kick knee.
Okay.
Can any,
Niki,</v>

974
00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:57.370
can nick,
can Nate to keep means Kinnikinnik.

975
00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.210
<v 1>It means whole of our fathers.
It means we smoke bark.</v>

976
00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.720
It's one of the only impressions I can do and I'm sure all the and is listening.

977
00:55:04.721 --> 00:55:08.110
You're like,
that's terrible.
Well,
it's just crazy.
We still call them Indians.

978
00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.550
It's like the dumbest shit of all time because they're not can landed in here

979
00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:17.380
once you know there's still nine.
That's why it's dob.
You're right.

980
00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:21.280
A lot of thoughts of it.
Back to the people using it.
It's offensive to all of us.

981
00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:25.380
Defensive to me,
I grew up playing cowboys and Indians.
I didn't know it was,

982
00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:28.090
you know,
saying something really fucking stupid

983
00:55:29.590 --> 00:55:31.990
to not Indian.
This is native American.

984
00:55:31.991 --> 00:55:35.200
It was just somebody thought it was somewhere else.
There are real Americans.

985
00:55:35.201 --> 00:55:39.270
He'd call,
I'm going to call them native Americans.
I guess it was native native.

986
00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:41.620
I like native in America.

987
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:45.190
There was a bunch of disputes about why America was named America,

988
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:48.790
but what I had heard ago Vespucci yeah,
that's what I had heard growing up.
Wow.

989
00:55:48.791 --> 00:55:51.940
Fuck yeah.
High school left when they're on it's time.

990
00:55:53.020 --> 00:55:54.280
That's what I had heard growing up,

991
00:55:54.281 --> 00:55:57.430
but I didn't even know who the fuck America Vespucci was until I like,

992
00:55:57.431 --> 00:56:00.760
why is this guy,
I thought Christopher Columbus discovered America.

993
00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:02.140
Who was the miracle?

994
00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:06.540
Vespucci I was fucking jackass who snuck in and change the whole fucking name.

995
00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:10.560
Wait a minute,
let us here.
America was named after America.
Vespucci do,

996
00:56:10.561 --> 00:56:15.400
did you do 15th century Florentine Merchant who owned a business in Seville,

997
00:56:15.401 --> 00:56:19.140
Spain.
Furnishing supplies for ships,
preparing them for merchants Heil.
Oh,

998
00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:22.660
so he didn't even discover it.
He's just like supplied Columbus with it.

999
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.300
So it really,
that is absolutely really what it was.

1000
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:27.010
So the shit that we learned in high school was true,

1001
00:56:27.370 --> 00:56:30.610
but why not call it a mirror ago?
Yeah,
it was just weird.

1002
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:34.420
How about you talk to someone who already lived here?
Yeah,
you guys call it.

1003
00:56:34.421 --> 00:56:37.810
But that's like somebody names a country after me and calls it aura.
Right.

1004
00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:40.300
It's like fucking name enough to me then bro.
Yeah.

1005
00:56:40.301 --> 00:56:43.600
Why are you calling it a miracle land?
Yeah.
American lands good.

1006
00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:48.130
We're a miracle and fuck.
Yeah,
it doesn't look the same.
Why America?

1007
00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:53.710
Cause it sounds right.
Mariko America sounds fine.
America.

1008
00:56:53.770 --> 00:56:55.780
You ever seen when people get really down on America,

1009
00:56:55.930 --> 00:57:00.490
they write the k with a k like,
like instead of ca and taken away our rights.

1010
00:57:00.510 --> 00:57:05.380
She was like,
no.
Cause it's like KKK Co really?
In America.

1011
00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.580
It's the federalist is Soviet Nazi fucking feeling to it.

1012
00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:15.600
Right.
Just see Rick Ross run over that guy.
Not Rick wrote his name.

1013
00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:20.860
Ah,
shook night.
Chuck Knight.
The video's out.
You watched it?
No,
not yet.

1014
00:57:21.010 --> 00:57:25.750
He ran over the guy's head.
Right?
Jamie show.
Oh Jamie,
please.
Oh my God,
I do that.

1015
00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:28.580
I don't want to see this.
You're right as a human,
but we're going to watch it.
Oh,

1016
00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:31.210
but it's not playing on TV.
Right.
All right,
go ahead.

1017
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:36.850
Fuck Dude,
this is something I'm not really interested in.
So what did he,

1018
00:57:37.010 --> 00:57:40.340
what did he do?
It was over a fight.
[inaudible] truck.
I'll do the idea.

1019
00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:44.140
Z Jane Boone.
Oh my God.

1020
00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:48.890
I think he showed up there filming the Nwa movie.
Oh,

1021
00:57:48.930 --> 00:57:50.830
the whole thing shook.
He wasn't invited.

1022
00:57:51.730 --> 00:57:54.220
The whole thing shook when bone got over there.
The whole car.

1023
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:57.640
So like he shook them or they shoot the Yang.
Yell at each other.

1024
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.890
I don't think any shots were fired.
No,
just get run over here.

1025
00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:07.840
Oh my God.
No Way.
Terry.

1026
00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:13.750
That's the guy who died.
Oh,
oh no.
Oh,
he ran them over.

1027
00:58:14.390 --> 00:58:18.970
Oh my God.
Wow.
Oh my God.
He pulled out random movement.
Oh my God.

1028
00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:24.310
I don't know.
It's just the,
Oh my God.
Wow.

1029
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:26.470
Wow.

1030
00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:29.500
Did they released it today so that people stopped like third party accounts stop

1031
00:58:29.501 --> 00:58:34.060
happening.
People say,
Oh my God.

1032
00:58:35.110 --> 00:58:39.910
Oh Wow.
That's so hard to watch.
Wow.

1033
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:45.700
Thanks for forced me to watch that.
You Fuck Jesus Christ.

1034
00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.450
So happens you don't get repercussions start then you can do whatever the fuck

1035
00:58:49.451 --> 00:58:53.800
you want to.
Who was that?
Who ran him over night?
Wow.
Yeah.

1036
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.660
Oh,
I mean that guy just got killed,
killed,

1037
00:58:58.750 --> 00:59:02.860
run over like by the head and then run over again.
Two of them hit two.

1038
00:59:02.861 --> 00:59:07.530
We ran over two guys.
Yep.
The second guy is the guy that died.
Guy Did not stop.

1039
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.880
He ran that guy over twice with a truck.
That's so insane.
Man.
That's so insane.

1040
00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.450
Oof.
Jesus Christ.
You can get away with murder.

1041
00:59:16.830 --> 00:59:20.380
Do you think you would do it ever?
You?

1042
00:59:20.381 --> 00:59:22.700
Only time you would ever do it as if like you were,

1043
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:27.050
someone was trying to attack you or someone's trying to attack someone that you

1044
00:59:27.051 --> 00:59:31.880
love fits of rage?
No.
No jealousy.

1045
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:35.960
No,
never.
That's why,
and that's why in that movie,

1046
00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:38.000
remember when they could tell the future and see who was going to kill,

1047
00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.380
what was that called?
Minority report.

1048
00:59:39.590 --> 00:59:41.780
The only one they couldn't catch where it fits of rage because they weren't

1049
00:59:41.781 --> 00:59:46.740
planned at all.
Right,
right.
That makes sense.
Thinking clearly,
that makes guys,

1050
00:59:46.741 --> 00:59:50.600
that's my red truck.
I got to run him over when I was a little kid.

1051
00:59:50.601 --> 00:59:53.930
I saw a lot of violence and it was very,
it was very uncomfortable.

1052
00:59:54.450 --> 00:59:57.200
So I a lot of like domestic abuse violence,

1053
00:59:57.230 --> 01:00:02.230
so I'm the last person that could ever get involved in that kind of shit.

1054
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:04.910
I just,
I'm not interested in fighting,

1055
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.930
especially with somebody that I care about.
I'm not interested in that.

1056
01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:13.700
I'm saying I'm saying you get away with it.
I wouldn't do it.
It just,

1057
01:00:13.790 --> 01:00:14.660
that's not an option.

1058
01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:17.910
The only reason why I would do it as if someone was trying to attack me,
right?

1059
01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.850
Like I wouldn't be the person that attacked them.

1060
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:24.020
The only way I would ever attack someone is if I thought that my life was in

1061
01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:28.370
danger or my health was in danger or someone else's health or life was in
danger.

1062
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:33.500
I would never just hit somebody cause I was mad at him.
Right.
I mean murder them,

1063
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:38.560
erase them.
Any of those things I to do that,
I would've already done it if I,

1064
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.880
if that was my path,
if I was on that path,

1065
01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.340
even if it was free and legal and you'd get away with it,

1066
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.300
it wouldn't just who you are as a person changes who you are as a person.

1067
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:51.220
If you're eliminating people.
If you're,
you're harming you go.

1068
01:00:51.221 --> 01:00:53.120
And after people got,
some people say,

1069
01:00:53.121 --> 01:00:55.670
I would never be able to live with myself and I that I disagree with for

1070
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:57.880
everybody because everyone who does it lives with themselves.
Okay,

1071
01:00:57.881 --> 01:01:01.910
well let's say this Ted Bundy,
but if you found Ted Bundy would have Ted Bundy,

1072
01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:05.480
uh,
did that to someone that you knew and killed book.
No,
I felt terrible.

1073
01:01:05.481 --> 01:01:09.080
And you had a chance to catch him in the act yet.

1074
01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:11.600
Catch him as he was trying to abduct a woman.

1075
01:01:11.601 --> 01:01:13.430
You knew it was Ted Bundy and I could,

1076
01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.480
I wish I would end that motherfucker so easy.
He would do that.

1077
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:21.800
Oh yeah,
100%.
If I saw Ted Bundy,

1078
01:01:22.410 --> 01:01:25.710
like trying to drag a woman,
and I knew it was Ted Bundy.
Yeah,

1079
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:29.990
100% I'd kill him.
He's in jail,
right?
Percent.
He's dead.
They killed him.

1080
01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.210
But I would have killed him.
You would've shore.

1081
01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:35.180
That's a guy that I won't even think twice if I had a gun and shoot him fed

1082
01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:37.970
knife out at stake.
It wasn't about to do something.
But you knew Ted Bundy.

1083
01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.280
I probably still kill them.
Yeah.
Yeah,

1084
01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:43.370
but do you probably do something again though?
I would probably,

1085
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:48.080
I'd probably confront him and then he would give me a reason to think that he

1086
01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:53.060
was dangerous and then I would,
I would try to kill him.
Confront.
Yeah.
If you,

1087
01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:57.930
if you knew that some guy was,
if you,
if he got away from you,
he was,

1088
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.570
he's addicted to killing women.

1089
01:01:59.990 --> 01:02:02.870
He wouldn't kill that guy if you know for sure it's that guy.
Right.

1090
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:06.890
That's the problem.
Cosby.
We're just stops them from doing that.
Yeah.

1091
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.080
I mean if you caught him,
oh my God,
what would you do if you caught a guy?

1092
01:02:10.081 --> 01:02:12.340
If you need to stop doing this?
I can't man,
because I,

1093
01:02:12.341 --> 01:02:15.830
that's the only time I can get hard as it,
so I can't stop.

1094
01:02:15.831 --> 01:02:18.830
So what are you going to do now?
Could you imagine that conversation?
I mean,

1095
01:02:18.831 --> 01:02:20.060
let's say we're not even talking

1096
01:02:20.060 --> 01:02:23.570
<v 0>about,
don't even say it's bill Cosby.
Let's just assume it was someone else.
Okay.</v>

1097
01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:26.640
Forget what good's not attach him.
[inaudible] he did or didn't do it.

1098
01:02:26.641 --> 01:02:29.550
I'm but some white guy,
some white guy.
So some random person,

1099
01:02:29.551 --> 01:02:34.551
if you walked in and some random person had drugged a woman and was busy fucking

1100
01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:37.530
her body and she didn't even,
you know,
probably didn't,

1101
01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:40.810
not only did barely knew the guy,
he just,
no,

1102
01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:45.710
I mean it's already happening.
No,

1103
01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:50.070
he should stop now.
It would probably be so dangerous to confront it.

1104
01:02:50.071 --> 01:02:53.760
Like the kind of person that's willing to do that.
This is where it gets dark,

1105
01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:57.150
you know,
whether it's a guy we were talking about before,

1106
01:02:57.151 --> 01:02:59.010
that comedian fellow or anybody else,

1107
01:02:59.011 --> 01:03:04.011
some random person to type of person that has the mindset to want to put you in

1108
01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:09.030
an intoxicated state,
like a dud,
a drug state.
So you don't know what happened.

1109
01:03:09.031 --> 01:03:11.250
You wake up and you're like,
why am I naked?
Like what's going on?

1110
01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:14.790
And he thinks that's funny or he thinks that's acceptable.

1111
01:03:14.791 --> 01:03:17.430
Or he can live with that and he can do it again and again and again.

1112
01:03:17.431 --> 01:03:21.120
Like he's done it many,
many times before.
There's a dehumanizing effect of that.

1113
01:03:21.121 --> 01:03:24.660
That's terrifying.
It's not not just sexual.

1114
01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:29.790
There's a De humanizing thing of you deciding to shut someone's consciousness

1115
01:03:29.791 --> 01:03:34.200
off.
And then do what you would with with the routes.
So crazy dude.

1116
01:03:34.201 --> 01:03:37.920
It is beyond creepy.
It is terrifying.

1117
01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.940
So how do you get that?
You get that as your affliction that you need to do that.

1118
01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:46.770
You would have to talk to someone far smarter than me and I could speculate all

1119
01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:50.400
day and I'm sure have,
remember that one guy in that show,
whatever.

1120
01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:54.060
That's what they call child molesters.
Yeah.
Oh the catch a predator.

1121
01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.960
But one guy was so resigned,
I could tell he was so resigned to that.

1122
01:03:57.961 --> 01:04:01.200
Him being this way that he was like,
once he came out,
it's like,

1123
01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:02.790
do you know where we're here?
Is like,
oh,
he goes,

1124
01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:05.820
just get the cops so they can lock me up and execute me already.

1125
01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.960
Like he was talking about like that he couldn't change and I know he couldn't

1126
01:04:09.961 --> 01:04:14.400
change,
so we needed someone to catch up.
Can it be stopped?
He knew it.

1127
01:04:14.490 --> 01:04:17.070
So terrifying.
It's terrifying.

1128
01:04:17.071 --> 01:04:20.190
And the fact that you'll talk to women and they'll tell you that they've been

1129
01:04:20.191 --> 01:04:24.120
drugged.
Oh,
like I've talked a bunch of different girls,
a bit of an drug.

1130
01:04:24.121 --> 01:04:24.821
Do you know you'll,

1131
01:04:24.821 --> 01:04:27.480
you'll hear them talking about it or you'll be talking about it and someone will

1132
01:04:27.481 --> 01:04:31.800
come over.
That happened to me.
Did you hear a talking to Larry King?
No.

1133
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:35.140
Jeremy's talking to Larry.
Larry King recently.
No,

1134
01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:39.990
a long time ago about Spanish law.
Yes,
I did hear that.
Yeah,
that was disturbing.

1135
01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.540
Now looking back,
it's so disturbing.

1136
01:04:42.541 --> 01:04:44.370
And Larry King's trying to giggle along like he's like,

1137
01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:45.360
I don't want to fuck up the interview,

1138
01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:49.490
but like what he's talking about giving them drugs that make them horny.
Yeah.

1139
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:53.550
Against her will finish fly.
Yeah.
Listen,
don't dose people.

1140
01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:56.040
That's just a standard rule.

1141
01:04:56.041 --> 01:05:00.300
But Joey Diaz is dose people and I've let them take whatever was Joey Diaz now

1142
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:05.630
with these stars that are a hundred and hundred milligrams or 125 so I'm like,

1143
01:05:06.631 --> 01:05:09.060
how much are they for real?
He goes,
yeah,
it's not,
it's like,

1144
01:05:09.090 --> 01:05:11.520
it's like 50 25 and 50 and I was like,
really?

1145
01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:15.060
So I get there and I see it's a 25 is like,
okay,
but something's fishy.

1146
01:05:15.061 --> 01:05:18.640
Just like these bill Cosby people,
they knew something was up.
These girls like,

1147
01:05:18.641 --> 01:05:22.660
wait,
what do you have a Cappuccino machine in your bedroom?
What's left?
Hold on.

1148
01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:24.760
And they knew something was up but they couldn't stop it.

1149
01:05:24.761 --> 01:05:27.220
And Joey d is something that looked fishing on a label on.
I asked him later,

1150
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:28.680
I'm like,
what's up with that later?

1151
01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:32.950
I just took other labels and put it over the fucking hundred 25 milligram label

1152
01:05:32.951 --> 01:05:36.790
and I ate two of those motherfuckers.
He dosed you does everybody.

1153
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:41.290
Why did he do that?
He thought it'd be funny.
Then he was right.
He was right.

1154
01:05:42.190 --> 01:05:44.660
He knows that he knew I could handle it whether or not I needed to or not.

1155
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:46.990
So he wasn't intent on raping,
you know?

1156
01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:50.050
And he did let you know that you're going to be taking a marijuana.

1157
01:05:50.051 --> 01:05:53.140
I just didn't let you know that it was way stronger than it really is.
The best.

1158
01:05:53.141 --> 01:05:53.771
Alex Jones,

1159
01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:56.620
when he was like giving him a cookie at one of those dfcs and Alex Jones like

1160
01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:57.790
what's in his cooking?
Because you don't,

1161
01:05:57.791 --> 01:06:01.520
what the fuck is not going to eat the fucking cookie?
It's like mad.
Like,

1162
01:06:01.890 --> 01:06:03.880
how do you stop holding his fucking Hunky?
Come on.
Come on,
man.

1163
01:06:03.881 --> 01:06:06.030
That was a fun weekend.
That was part good.

1164
01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.880
Alex Jones all weekend at a UFC came to the comedy show.

1165
01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:14.470
He came and hung out.
Vegas.
Was that?
Yeah,
he's been to a bunch of comedy shows.

1166
01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:16.750
He was at my most recent.
That was cool as shit.

1167
01:06:16.751 --> 01:06:20.410
See If someones says thank you again for those.
Oh,
the right behind ringside.

1168
01:06:20.411 --> 01:06:24.640
Seen him smile and big smile on his face.
Extra frosty.
Yeah.
That's great man.

1169
01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:28.240
Sitting back there.
It's amazing.
So fun.
That place is awesome.

1170
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:33.160
Even if it is just girl fights.
This girl fights.
He says,

1171
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:38.500
I'm not interested,
not interested in girls fighting until she loses around.

1172
01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.660
Then it's just an exhibition.
I like it.
I liked that excavation.
Yeah,

1173
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:47.110
it's cool.
It's fun.
It's fun.
You know what man?

1174
01:06:47.111 --> 01:06:50.920
She's like this in this Roy Jones Jr in his prime state.
Yeah.

1175
01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:54.160
Roy Jones Jr in his prime was just fucking everybody up.

1176
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.010
He's putting his hands behind his back and knocking dudes out,

1177
01:06:57.550 --> 01:07:00.840
knocking guys like Virgil hill out with a body shot.
And while everybody,

1178
01:07:00.841 --> 01:07:04.240
everybody's like,
God Damn Roy Jones,
you know who's Virgil Hill?

1179
01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:06.100
Who see the guy who took care of macho man,
Randy Savage,

1180
01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.530
he was a million dollar man.
That's,
it's in virtually MP gold medalist,

1181
01:07:11.531 --> 01:07:16.210
but I believe he was an Olympic boxer and he was also a,
um,

1182
01:07:16.630 --> 01:07:21.160
uh,
a light heavyweight champion.
And uh,
yeah,
this is,
um,

1183
01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:27.640
yeah.
Anyway,
he,
uh,
I believe it was Virgil Hill.

1184
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:32.560
He fought a Roy Jones and Roy Jones hit him with this fucking body shot that was

1185
01:07:32.561 --> 01:07:36.900
just ridiculous.
Wow.
Really cracked him to the body.

1186
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:41.350
You see them just crumble on a body shot.
Yeah,
he was a bad motherfucker.
Yeah.

1187
01:07:41.351 --> 01:07:43.810
He won a silver medal in the Olympic Games in 1984,

1188
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:45.880
but Olympic box is always super thin.
Right.

1189
01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:50.420
That was heavy weights aren't heavyweights.
No.
I mean,
look,

1190
01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.980
cause there's youngest was an Olympian.
A British was the Olympian.

1191
01:07:53.981 --> 01:07:56.490
They were big guys,
but then they get picked or later.
Here's the,

1192
01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.930
here's Roy Jones Jr fighting Virgil.

1193
01:07:58.931 --> 01:08:01.480
And Virgil was like real high level fighter at the time.

1194
01:08:01.481 --> 01:08:04.540
Man Who's a world champion with hurdles in the black pants.
Boom.

1195
01:08:04.541 --> 01:08:07.810
Look at this body shot.
Oh he holds it son.

1196
01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:12.280
Yo hardest knock a guy out on the left side of his body.
Okay.
That's what,

1197
01:08:12.281 --> 01:08:14.140
that's what he hit him with a right hand to the body.

1198
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:17.960
Usually it's a left and the reason being is not,
not usually,

1199
01:08:17.961 --> 01:08:22.560
but it's hard to knock a guy out with a right hand because like floating rib he

1200
01:08:22.561 --> 01:08:24.290
got him in the floating around.
He probably broke his rib.

1201
01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:29.420
It's usually on the left side because the left side is where the liver is so

1202
01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:32.790
weird for someone to go down like none ever watching UFC cause I'm going to go

1203
01:08:32.791 --> 01:08:36.080
down like that and then no one jumping on him.
Yeah,
exactly right.

1204
01:08:36.081 --> 01:08:37.130
It just seems so strange.

1205
01:08:37.131 --> 01:08:40.130
He's holding his side and you're like the why is this fight still going in the

1206
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:43.340
fight when you always see dudes throwing left hook to the body.

1207
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:46.590
Cause from the left side,
like if you're attacking that,

1208
01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.930
that side of the body that you're going to hit,

1209
01:08:47.931 --> 01:08:49.970
which is his right side is where the liver is.

1210
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.330
So Roy Jones knocked him out with a body shot on the opposite side that you

1211
01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:56.720
usually usually getting either in the solar plexus or the liver,

1212
01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.790
but he hits so goddamn hard.
He was so fast.

1213
01:08:59.150 --> 01:09:03.530
But the point is like that's where Rhonda is a right above fucking everybody up.

1214
01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:06.210
She's just fucking everybody up and matter of fact decent.
Oh No.

1215
01:09:06.230 --> 01:09:08.570
It's like when I see,
when I saw Anderson in his prime,

1216
01:09:08.571 --> 01:09:10.070
when people call him the greatest of all time,

1217
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:12.500
but his primary is fucking up guys that were like,

1218
01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:16.280
I could see winning a title if not for him.
Right.
Like rich Franklin.

1219
01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:20.000
Rich Franklin was was world champion yanked him out.
Yeah.
So it's like,

1220
01:09:20.450 --> 01:09:20.961
I don't know,

1221
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:25.961
when I see the 11th ranked fighter in the world five and five it's like what

1222
01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.880
we're talking about here.
Well it took now Rhonda,

1223
01:09:30.890 --> 01:09:34.970
but to take away from the rest of the fucking way class.
It's a growing sport.

1224
01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:39.860
Yeah,
it's MMA is like men's MMA in 2000 or maybe even before then.

1225
01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.800
You know it's still growing.

1226
01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:46.500
I mean the UFC was started in [inaudible] 94 it became mainstream in like 2000

1227
01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:49.730
that'll be good for like girls training now.
Oh yeah.

1228
01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:50.720
They'll like the 16 year olds.

1229
01:09:50.721 --> 01:09:53.720
Like you know what I want to do MMA and then eight years there'll be legitimate

1230
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:55.150
contenders for titles.
Yeah.

1231
01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:59.420
But like setting it up for later fucking star wars episode one.
Yeah.

1232
01:09:59.421 --> 01:10:02.210
But it's interesting man,
because she's not going to keep going forever.

1233
01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.820
There's going to,
someone's going to come along like they always come along.

1234
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:09.350
Like someone came along with her eventually 10 years fighting into her thirties

1235
01:10:09.351 --> 01:10:13.070
for sure.
Right now she's in her prime,
but if she keeps fighting,
you know,

1236
01:10:13.071 --> 01:10:16.790
if Cyborg can figure out a way to get down on one 35 that could be from fucking

1237
01:10:16.810 --> 01:10:18.330
interesting.
But she,

1238
01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:22.610
she showed a photo of herself the other day on a scale and she said one 75 yeah,

1239
01:10:22.611 --> 01:10:24.050
like a couple of days after her fight.

1240
01:10:25.840 --> 01:10:30.050
One 75 that's what I should way.
Yeah,
I don't,
what are you talking about?
I mean,

1241
01:10:30.051 --> 01:10:33.320
I don't know if that's like to try to get people to be sympathetic about the

1242
01:10:33.321 --> 01:10:35.300
fact that if you want to get that fight with Ronda,

1243
01:10:35.690 --> 01:10:40.690
make fight at 45 but can get the fuck out of here with that one 75 yeah,

1244
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:47.170
policy.
I bet she's probably all five.
Eight.
Jesus.
Yeah.

1245
01:10:47.610 --> 01:10:51.530
When I'm one 75 I'm in the middle of my BMI.
I'm like where I should be.

1246
01:10:51.531 --> 01:10:55.380
Not Thin or big at six three yeah.

1247
01:10:55.381 --> 01:10:59.870
She is a thick woman.
Let me see how tall she is.
Five.
Eight.
Yeah.

1248
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:02.850
She's five.
Eight.
Yup.

1249
01:11:02.851 --> 01:11:06.470
See there's her 75 one 75 God,
her toes look tough.

1250
01:11:07.550 --> 01:11:11.060
Fucking bruised up.
Let's go to lunch.

1251
01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.110
Somebody lifts in Chicago in the winter.
They get all the things you should look

1252
01:11:14.140 --> 01:11:16.740
<v 1>at the right foot with a scar.
That's probably from some of his fucking teeth.</v>

1253
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:20.680
Oh yeah.
She's probably kicked someone's teeth in with that foot.
She's,

1254
01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:24.570
she's bad ass man.
Say what you will about or prior substance use.

1255
01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:27.870
I'm just talking about those fucking fee.

1256
01:11:27.900 --> 01:11:31.680
The finished product of a Chris I born Jesus written on the side of him.

1257
01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:35.730
Is that what it says?
I Dunno.
Something like that.
It looks like Jesus,

1258
01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:40.320
the one she wants to knock you out with.
She's knocked you out with you.

1259
01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:45.120
She's got a hairy knuckles.
Maybe it's just,
no,
I don't think so.

1260
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:50.220
I don't see any hair freckles.
Fuck.
It's tough chick.

1261
01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:52.680
But that's the one out there.
What's up?
Have a tote.

1262
01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.620
That's the one out there that's like,
that's the big money.

1263
01:11:56.010 --> 01:11:59.280
If she loses a round in that,
then I'll start watching female MMA.
Well,

1264
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:03.690
this is what I think.
I think the UFC should have a 145 pound women's division.

1265
01:12:03.990 --> 01:12:07.770
So see,
like I know about Cyborg and a lot of other people know about Cyborg,

1266
01:12:07.771 --> 01:12:12.450
but most people don't have no idea.
Like people that are just UFC fans.
Yeah.

1267
01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:14.980
What are they have to 35 and 25 and that's it.
No,

1268
01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:20.090
they have 35 in one 15 and 15 and one 15 is the one that is,

1269
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:21.550
uh,
this weekend.
Uh,

1270
01:12:21.570 --> 01:12:25.350
Johana you and Jay Chick is a fighting Carlos spars.

1271
01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:30.080
Carla Esparza and that's um,
that's for the strawweight title.
Okay.

1272
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:33.470
Straw away.
I love this one.
50 guys fighting.
Yo,

1273
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:37.110
these girls are bad ass to move quicker and a,
the chick Johana,

1274
01:12:37.111 --> 01:12:41.790
you and Jay check his Muay Thai world champion elite elite striking skills and

1275
01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.220
Carl was real tough wrestler.
It's going to be really interesting,

1276
01:12:44.221 --> 01:12:45.054
really interesting fight.

1277
01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:49.230
But my thing is I think that one 45 they have a one 45 in Invicta,

1278
01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.770
which is something that the UFC owns.
INVICTA is,
I'm bringing him up.

1279
01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.450
Maybe they own it or they're part of it.

1280
01:12:54.451 --> 01:12:56.950
I don't know if the UFC bought it there somehow or another.

1281
01:12:56.951 --> 01:12:59.220
They're working together.
I believe the UFC bought it.

1282
01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:01.950
I don't pay attention to the shit I should probably,
it's part of my job,

1283
01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:04.800
but that's not nice.
Not a here nor there.
What's,

1284
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:07.590
what's important is they have all women fights.
They have a lot of fighters.

1285
01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:11.460
It's like you just bring them all with the UFC.
Let's just bring them over man.

1286
01:13:11.670 --> 01:13:15.330
Bring one 45 over and fight in the UFC that if Ronda wants to move up,

1287
01:13:15.331 --> 01:13:18.500
let her move up.
We'll then,
not only that,
people will be calling for it,
right.

1288
01:13:18.630 --> 01:13:20.910
Cause right now they're not calling for it cause they don't know.

1289
01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:22.770
Like I would say.
Yeah,
it's interesting.

1290
01:13:22.980 --> 01:13:26.700
Do I understand why they would want to fighter at one 35?
Of course.
Yeah.

1291
01:13:26.701 --> 01:13:29.400
That's a smart thing to do.
You're going to find a fucking wrecking machine.

1292
01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.000
She's big and she knocked bitches out.
You know,
she,

1293
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:36.300
she knocks chicks out in a way that very few fighters knocked being really,

1294
01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:41.160
oh yeah.
Yeah.
She puts it on girls.
She puts it on girl.
She's scary.
She's scary.

1295
01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.100
Um,
everyone should be scared of her.
They all should be scared.

1296
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:44.860
Especially if you're,

1297
01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.000
if you're a hiker woods in his prime with like when he went eight,

1298
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.420
10 tournaments a year,
it's like he was losing 15 tournaments here.

1299
01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:55.880
It was at some point challenged.
Well,
yeah.
Obviously that's different though too.

1300
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.240
It's like he was beating guys that were like,

1301
01:13:57.241 --> 01:14:00.240
Tyson was those 22nd fights in the beginning for sure.

1302
01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:03.450
But he was beaten guides that had belts that were like legit.

1303
01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:06.030
Like I've heard of this guy before.
I knew Leon Spinks.

1304
01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.290
I'd heard of him for years.
He brought his brother.
Oh Michael Spinks spanx.

1305
01:14:11.291 --> 01:14:15.100
Yeah.
But yeah,
he knocked him out in like 90 seconds was a destruction.

1306
01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:19.330
He just ran through him.
Michael Spinks was a legit world champion.
Larry Holmes.

1307
01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.750
Okay.
Yeah.
And then it was like you're beating those guys.
He beat,

1308
01:14:21.751 --> 01:14:24.790
he knocked Larry Holmes out,
man.
Now Larry was past his prime.

1309
01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:29.350
I want to say Larry's in his like late thirties now.
Fight.
No,

1310
01:14:29.351 --> 01:14:31.300
I think he's too old now.
He's older than me.

1311
01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:35.500
I'm 47 I think he's 48 or 49 oh yeah,
he was,

1312
01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.250
I mean people I didn't have,
I mean,
no actually Jordan.

1313
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:42.310
But the way people talked about when Mike Tyson was fighting,

1314
01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:45.840
cause like everyone stopped what they were doing.
You know,

1315
01:14:45.850 --> 01:14:47.320
it was like Mike Tyson is coming out.
What do you think?

1316
01:14:47.321 --> 01:14:50.070
People just talk about it.
You've seen that documentary,
right?
[inaudible]

1317
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:54.340
you haven't seen the Tyson documentary?
Yeah.
Holy Shit Dude.
It's really amazing.

1318
01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:56.620
Yeah,
he tells his life story.
It's incredible.

1319
01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:59.350
And that's how they decided to do this one man show,

1320
01:14:59.410 --> 01:15:01.410
which I think spike Lee previous is it,
right?
Yeah.

1321
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:04.540
And they do this one man show and Tyson,
it's,

1322
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:06.790
he's killing them all over the world with this show.

1323
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:10.660
Is he showing and traveling and doing?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He did it in a raging bull.

1324
01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.720
He wasn't in La or in Vegas and he had an la for awhile or did it once it shows

1325
01:15:15.941 --> 01:15:19.420
up places and you'd like to do like a run and in a theater and it's good.

1326
01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:23.320
Oh yeah.
People love it,
man.
People love it.
His story's incredible.

1327
01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:26.470
His grown up on the streets like that.
Yeah.
Praise him.
Pigeons.

1328
01:15:26.471 --> 01:15:28.420
They talk about the pigeons.
I forgot about the pigeons.

1329
01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.430
I don't know if how much they talked about the pigeons cause I,

1330
01:15:30.431 --> 01:15:34.390
it's been pigeons.
It's on Hbo Right now.
The Tyson documentary.

1331
01:15:34.690 --> 01:15:38.280
See if you can find Mike Tyson talking about,
uh,

1332
01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:42.650
what was going through his mind when he's walking to the ring because there's

1333
01:15:42.651 --> 01:15:45.880
just one thing where he was talking about what it was like when he was in his

1334
01:15:45.881 --> 01:15:49.900
prime,
while he was describing what was going through his mind,

1335
01:15:50.230 --> 01:15:53.320
like all his nerves and apprehension and all these different things and how they

1336
01:15:53.321 --> 01:15:57.310
would evaporate as you would slowly but surely get closer and closer to the
ring.

1337
01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.950
Wow.
And then when he go,
when he stepped in through it goes,

1338
01:15:59.951 --> 01:16:04.810
once I stepped into that role by I'm a god,
whoa.
And I was like,
oh my God.

1339
01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:07.360
Like when he says that,
like I'm a God.

1340
01:16:07.510 --> 01:16:09.040
Like that was what's going through his mind.

1341
01:16:09.041 --> 01:16:12.610
Like he like he could get to that level that from like start them to finish.
Wow.

1342
01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.140
Can we just ramp himself up?

1343
01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:16.480
And then once he got in there and he looked at his opponent,

1344
01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:21.310
he just knew he was just going to smash like Ghostbusters.
Who are you?

1345
01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:24.490
Are you are God,
no.
Then Dory,

1346
01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.410
I just saw it.
There's no way I could remember that.
Intimidation.

1347
01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.730
<v 3>I'm pretty much intimidated.
They love to fight the foot.
Even got hit.</v>

1348
01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:37.860
Most Guy I knew I needed,
um,
artists got Doug.

1349
01:16:37.930 --> 01:16:41.240
He's these guy that knew how to beat these guys psychologically before I even

1350
01:16:41.241 --> 01:16:42.230
got in the ring with them.

1351
01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:47.330
As soon as I come into the rain that's coming to the ring,
I'm glow.
No stop.

1352
01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.760
That's not true.
While I'm in the dressing room,
five minutes before I come out,

1353
01:16:52.790 --> 01:16:56.250
my gloves are laced up.
I'm breaking my gloves down and Bro,

1354
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:59.270
I'm pushing the lever on the back of my leg in the middle of the glove for my

1355
01:16:59.271 --> 01:17:01.010
knuckle.
Compares to the look and feel.

1356
01:17:01.011 --> 01:17:05.650
My knuckles peer thing is the tight leather gloves on the Everlast boxing gloves

1357
01:17:05.690 --> 01:17:10.190
come out.
I have supreme confidence,
but I'm scared to death.
I'm totally afraid.

1358
01:17:10.191 --> 01:17:13.550
I'm afraid of Evec name,
afraid of losing.
I'm afraid of being humiliated,

1359
01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.910
but I'm totally confident close.
I get to arraign more confidence.

1360
01:17:16.911 --> 01:17:21.080
I get the close up,
more confidence.
I get the closer,
more confident I get.

1361
01:17:21.500 --> 01:17:23.810
All during my training,
I've been afraid of this man.

1362
01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:25.760
I thought this man might be capable of beating me.

1363
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:28.650
I've dreamed of him beating me but that low,

1364
01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.540
but I always stayed the afraid of him,
but it was closer.

1365
01:17:31.541 --> 01:17:34.790
I get to her and I'm more confident once I'm in the ring,
I'm a God.

1366
01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:35.653
No one could be,

1367
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:42.560
oh my God,
I'm walking around or him.
I never,

1368
01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.740
I never take my eyes off my opponent.
I keep my eyes on,

1369
01:17:45.770 --> 01:17:47.900
even if he's already in pumping,

1370
01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:51.650
he can't wait to get his hands on me as well and keep my eyes on my,

1371
01:17:51.651 --> 01:17:55.640
keep my eyes on him.
I keep my eyes on him.
Then once I see a chink in his armor,

1372
01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:59.030
boom,
and one of his eyes may move and then I know I have them.

1373
01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:00.830
Then when it comes to the senator,
the ring,

1374
01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:04.610
he still looks at me with his Pearson looking as if he's not afraid,

1375
01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:06.510
but he already made that mistake when,

1376
01:18:06.810 --> 01:18:09.020
when he looked down for that one 10th of a second.

1377
01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.350
I know I hadn't had a fight hard for the first two or three rounds.

1378
01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:17.320
I know I already broken spirit.
Did she keep screaming the confidence?

1379
01:18:17.350 --> 01:18:21.080
I'm moving my head.
He throwing punches.
Wow.
He's on the ground,
dodge generate.

1380
01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.410
I'm adding them to the body.

1381
01:18:22.450 --> 01:18:25.550
I'm punching the real heart and I'm punching and punching him.

1382
01:18:25.551 --> 01:18:29.750
I know he's not able to take my punches.
One,
two,
three punch.
I'm throwing him up.

1383
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:33.660
Punches in bunches goes down.
He's out.
I'm Victoria.

1384
01:18:33.690 --> 01:18:36.710
Jesus Christ,
Mike Tyson,
greatest fighter ever.

1385
01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:39.980
Live cheese.
Jesus Christ.

1386
01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:44.450
<v 1>Wow.
That was cool when he was at it.</v>

1387
01:18:44.451 --> 01:18:48.680
I liked that train in fear of this guy beating.
You'll see your train harder.

1388
01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:51.860
Yeah.
That's what comics need.
You need confidence when you're on stage,

1389
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:54.500
but lack of confidence every other moment.

1390
01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:59.030
Complete like you suck.
Get better,
you suck,
get better.

1391
01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:01.250
You definitely can't have a distorted perception.

1392
01:19:01.251 --> 01:19:03.110
If you start being a conference you won't get better.

1393
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:06.800
Well it's the one thing that we all despise is a comic who's not

1394
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:12.410
doing well.
Right?
Yeah.
Everybody despises you.
That was great.
Like really?

1395
01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.590
You're saying that out loud?
That was great.
We just saw you bomb.

1396
01:19:15.591 --> 01:19:18.560
You got to admit you bombed.
Otherwise we can talk cause you and I bomb.

1397
01:19:18.561 --> 01:19:18.981
I'm going to tell you,

1398
01:19:18.981 --> 01:19:23.410
I just hate fucking fat dick up there like fuck like memory.

1399
01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:26.930
You call me,
you tell me you had a bad set in London where we talked about it.

1400
01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:30.830
Like that shit happens man.
Such a bad,
sad,
devastating.

1401
01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:32.490
That's fucking dope books.

1402
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:36.230
So if someone pretends that it's not like we can't talk now,

1403
01:19:36.540 --> 01:19:38.690
now we can't talk because now you're not being real.

1404
01:19:38.860 --> 01:19:40.880
Do you always own up and be cool?
And they're like,

1405
01:19:40.881 --> 01:19:44.090
not every time you win you win everything.
You're the best ever.

1406
01:19:44.210 --> 01:19:47.500
It was always the bitch though.
He's a gold medal baby.

1407
01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:52.060
Both metal number one in class number one with Jim,
number one football.

1408
01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:56.470
If I pick up sports,
I pick a number one is amazing.
Jesus,

1409
01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:58.670
that was so cool.
Just a great moment in time.

1410
01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.170
What he's thinking of as it comes to the,

1411
01:20:01.490 --> 01:20:03.740
and that reminds me of what you were thinking of when you're walking through

1412
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:07.450
that hotel fire in San Francisco when she could see right now night

1413
01:20:08.950 --> 01:20:12.720
<v 0>on comedy central.
If you want to see these older stories,
they're on a,</v>

1414
01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:15.980
they're on a on demand,
but they're also on youtube.
If you go to it,

1415
01:20:15.981 --> 01:20:17.430
this is not happening.
Playlist.

1416
01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.700
You can see all of them pull the last this year and the last season.

1417
01:20:20.701 --> 01:20:24.030
The one before that.
Rogan has got another story too.
Last year.

1418
01:20:24.390 --> 01:20:27.510
That's a better one.
Quite honestly.
You think so?
All Right,
nice.

1419
01:20:27.630 --> 01:20:30.960
I'll look at that one to shepherd.
The shepherd wants to.
True story too.

1420
01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:34.200
I liked how you worked on this one.
It made it better though.
I'd made it better,

1421
01:20:34.201 --> 01:20:37.530
but it's just,
it's not as good.
The hotel fire one is just,

1422
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:41.910
the stripper story is just so good.
I remember that bitch still to this day.

1423
01:20:41.911 --> 01:20:45.570
Think about her.
She was so crazy.
To this day,

1424
01:20:45.571 --> 01:20:49.440
I almost wish I could find a way.
It's like barely stay in touch with her.

1425
01:20:49.500 --> 01:20:53.040
Just to clear a doc.
That story too,
like,
I don't know.
I don't do stories,
man.

1426
01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:55.440
I don't have any stories.
I'm like,
you have one.
That's amazing.

1427
01:20:55.441 --> 01:20:59.910
What about power and I've seen your talent.
Oh yeah.
What's so good about it?

1428
01:20:59.911 --> 01:21:03.860
I forgot about that story.
Almost a million views now.
That's hilarious.
Yeah.

1429
01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:09.000
Yeah.
So nice to see you go from,

1430
01:21:09.570 --> 01:21:12.510
you know those early days where you trying to become a paid regular,

1431
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:16.990
struggling to see you now while you're balling out of control feels where he

1432
01:21:16.991 --> 01:21:19.620
talked you into buying a luxury automobile.
It's not going to happen.

1433
01:21:19.650 --> 01:21:22.860
She's fucking frugal bastard.
It's not fruit.
I'm leaving La.

1434
01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:26.010
I'm not going to have a car for the next 10 months.
Even like baller

1435
01:21:28.060 --> 01:21:31.680
stored outside my apartment that's used that shit and put it like a cardboard

1436
01:21:31.681 --> 01:21:35.020
cutout of you with your cock hanging out and leave it there to guard it.

1437
01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:39.000
That's how I'll put a for sale.
Sign it.
Which is a big Dick.

1438
01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:43.440
That's the price for sale.
Yeah.

1439
01:21:44.010 --> 01:21:46.260
I don't even money anymore.
I was poor for too long.

1440
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:48.930
So now my content with very little.
That's nice.

1441
01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:51.330
But you're going to get used to like,
what do I do with this money?

1442
01:21:52.150 --> 01:21:53.550
I don't have to start buying some shit.

1443
01:21:53.551 --> 01:21:55.980
Otherwise it's stupid to have money and then you're gonna.
You know,

1444
01:21:55.981 --> 01:22:00.480
I need a car and we're going to go get a car.
Come on,
get a car.
Oh,

1445
01:22:00.490 --> 01:22:03.060
I'm just going to get something like a Prius or something that's good on gas and

1446
01:22:03.510 --> 01:22:06.510
we'll talk you into a BMW or something.
Yeah.
Exact corrupted.

1447
01:22:06.511 --> 01:22:10.890
Like Dunkin Dunkins Karakia and he's got a nice black Mercedes Benz.

1448
01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:15.930
Dunkin's corrupted
these bans.
Yeah.

1449
01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.500
I always told ducking lives large.
Got a tangerine tree in his backyard.

1450
01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:24.660
Tangerine little delicious homegrown fruit.
Yeah.

1451
01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:25.741
Wonder what,
how,
what,

1452
01:22:25.741 --> 01:22:30.030
how pollution affects like plants that you eat like a garden and you're in

1453
01:22:30.031 --> 01:22:32.460
silver lake.
You're dealing with some fucking,

1454
01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.460
some destructive water to cause someone was like,
you gotta wash the outside.

1455
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:36.151
But I'm like,
but it's,

1456
01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:41.090
the inside is drinking polluted water and putting that into the fruit.
Yeah,

1457
01:22:41.091 --> 01:22:45.800
right.
Depends.
I mean,
most people,
I think in California,
if you have a fruit tree,

1458
01:22:45.801 --> 01:22:50.801
you probably have to have some sort of a society irrigation system to flush

1459
01:22:50.881 --> 01:22:54.270
water it to water it to,
you're probably watering it from,

1460
01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:59.300
if that picks up all the,
all the pollution,
not pollution,
all the,
uh,

1461
01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:03.600
the fucking insecticides Po.
Well that's not,

1462
01:23:03.930 --> 01:23:06.010
wouldn't be in the water that

1463
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.890
<v 1>like you,
it comes out of your faucet.
Definitely doesn't happen.</v>

1464
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:11.800
Sexercise you think there's insecticides on his plants?
Like the fruit prints?

1465
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:15.820
Yeah.
With spray.
So that face not putting any sprays on his po?
No,
not Dunkin.

1466
01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.170
Oh yeah.
Okay.
That's what I'm saying.

1467
01:23:17.171 --> 01:23:20.770
I'm saying someone who grows fruit or vegetables or anything in their house in

1468
01:23:20.771 --> 01:23:25.420
Silver Lake.
Yeah.
If you're living in a place that is just gross,
La is polluted.

1469
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:29.380
Polluted.
There's no worry rounded it.
It's definitely not being in the mountains.

1470
01:23:29.381 --> 01:23:32.350
So you're right.
So is that in the tangerines to yeah.
How does,

1471
01:23:32.370 --> 01:23:36.210
what happens there if the tangerines are breathing the air and they feeds it,

1472
01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:41.170
the tree feeds,
yeah.
Think tree scrub more pollution.
Yeah.

1473
01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:43.990
We know that.
Right?
Because they eat carbon dioxide,

1474
01:23:45.400 --> 01:23:49.900
turns it into something [inaudible] convert them to less harmful compounds.

1475
01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:54.650
Well that's harmful.
Yeah.
Not even not harmful.
Less harmful.
It convert.

1476
01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.930
What is it saying?
Oh,

1477
01:23:55.931 --> 01:24:00.820
it absorbs pollutants and turn those into less harmful.
Right.

1478
01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:06.060
So it absorbs that and also creates oxygen.
Right?
I mean,
they fuck trees.

1479
01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:10.930
You need trees.
Yeah.
But my point is what happens to the fruit?

1480
01:24:11.050 --> 01:24:15.190
Like does the lotion in it feels like it would.
Yeah.

1481
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:18.240
It's good to have trees.
If you live in a shit hole.
It's,

1482
01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:21.880
everybody's got a science with Joe at Ori.
We don't know shit.

1483
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:27.670
Uh,
I think we're,
yeah,

1484
01:24:27.671 --> 01:24:31.930
it seems like it would be a better to have something growing where there's not

1485
01:24:31.931 --> 01:24:36.810
cars driving by every day you're going gonna eat it,
you know?
Yeah.
Yeah.

1486
01:24:36.820 --> 01:24:39.310
Probably not.
It's probably fucking terrible for you.

1487
01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.290
It's probably not like less good for you.

1488
01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:46.480
That was such a sweet me and Simona at one before he went to the UFC was so

1489
01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:47.314
good.

1490
01:24:48.190 --> 01:24:52.450
If you could compare that to a tangerine Gresh off the tree though.

1491
01:24:52.451 --> 01:24:54.940
It was like extra sweet.
Um,
you know,

1492
01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:58.210
it was like still getting nutrients while I was still being shaken while we were

1493
01:24:58.211 --> 01:25:02.890
fucking peeling it.
Pretty much.
Yeah.
Damn.
It's nice to have.

1494
01:25:02.891 --> 01:25:07.540
I used to have a fucking plum tree and it died,
man.
Really?
Yeah,
just got old.

1495
01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.780
I had it for a long time and it bared a lot of fruit.

1496
01:25:10.781 --> 01:25:15.781
It bread like the most fruit like the last couple of years before it petered

1497
01:25:15.941 --> 01:25:19.150
out.
Like it's almost like this last few years,
so good.

1498
01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:23.250
But it was just that last 4th of July,
you know,
grand finale,
blah blah blah blah,

1499
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:28.080
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom,
boom.
Then yeah,
the fireworks over another that

1500
01:25:30.430 --> 01:25:33.430
and then done one year just stopped growing fruit and I was like,
man,

1501
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:34.540
is there something wrong with the,

1502
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:38.380
like the irrigation we checked and it just got old.
Really?
Yeah.

1503
01:25:38.381 --> 01:25:41.710
Apparently some fruit trees just get old and they don't make fruit anymore.

1504
01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:44.760
Like people just like people,
I don't know what the year things.

1505
01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:46.960
I wonder how long had the fucking thing had been there.

1506
01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:49.960
I had assumed that whoever had made the house and put it there,

1507
01:25:50.350 --> 01:25:53.580
but I think that some people get them like planted as full trees.

1508
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:57.670
Like my neighbor and he grew a fucking orchard.
Orchard.
Orchard.

1509
01:25:57.940 --> 01:26:02.050
Orchard looks like it'd be court ordered worker.
He uh,

1510
01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:06.500
built one in his front yard.
That's cool.
Yeah.
Oh,
it looks really cool.

1511
01:26:06.501 --> 01:26:08.690
He's got like 20 trees over there.
Why don't you trees?
Yeah,

1512
01:26:08.691 --> 01:26:12.050
it's got like 20 of them and he installed them all like as full grown trees.

1513
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:17.150
So blocks of view influence,
I mean,
not really.

1514
01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.390
It's on the side of his house.
Oh,
I thought it's cool though.

1515
01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:21.980
It's a pretty big lot and he grows for,
I played Farmville.

1516
01:26:21.981 --> 01:26:26.610
I know what time it is.
You do play Farmville?
I did.
I did.
Not Anymore.
That is,

1517
01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:30.660
that's one of the things that is not up to date on the flip phone is Farmville

1518
01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:32.650
Games a week.
Well,
in,

1519
01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:38.220
let's talk about this and trying this thing where you've abandoned society and

1520
01:26:38.901 --> 01:26:41.900
everything's good,
not advantaged society.
I've gotten off the train.

1521
01:26:41.901 --> 01:26:46.901
I'm not even the iPhone slash android and wonderland of apps and videos and

1522
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:53.180
images to two and a half months now go back to a fucking skanky little flip

1523
01:26:53.181 --> 01:26:56.990
phone.
Yeah.
Ridiculous little thing that sucks at tests.
Texting.

1524
01:26:57.290 --> 01:26:58.400
How much better is you texting gun?

1525
01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:03.290
<v 0>Uh,
it's gotten better.
Absolutely.
I want to get one where it's like the,
the,
the,</v>

1526
01:27:03.370 --> 01:27:05.770
the uh,
you know,
the sidekick,
we flip it open,

1527
01:27:05.771 --> 01:27:10.360
but too many of those have,
I don't know,

1528
01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:12.700
she's gonna ask.
Yeah.
APPS that come standard with it.

1529
01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.320
What happens when people send you links?

1530
01:27:15.010 --> 01:27:17.310
I see the link and I have to email it to myself,
to my kids

1531
01:27:17.930 --> 01:27:22.650
<v 1>sitting.
I can look at it.
I mean,
how do you do it?</v>

1532
01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:25.800
Does that,
there's no other way.
That's hilarious.

1533
01:27:25.801 --> 01:27:28.030
Now his just fuck with you business wise.

1534
01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.730
<v 0>How are you,
should fear dot comedy direct.com?
Yeah.</v>

1535
01:27:32.750 --> 01:27:36.570
Everyone go there for my special Ari Shapiro Dot Comedy direction.com has

1536
01:27:36.571 --> 01:27:37.820
developed a business at all.
Okay.

1537
01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.900
If there was any time where I thought maybe I won't be able to handle this,

1538
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:46.850
it's while I had a premiere of my past paid regular special in January,

1539
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:48.860
the show,
the entire run of the show,

1540
01:27:48.861 --> 01:27:52.430
which was only two weeks left and passive aggressive.
My other special,

1541
01:27:53.930 --> 01:27:54.890
that would be the time,

1542
01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:57.890
right when I wouldn't be able to handle it and I'm getting by.

1543
01:27:58.730 --> 01:28:02.840
So I got to think in a month or two it's going to be a breeze.

1544
01:28:03.950 --> 01:28:08.230
Pluses to minuses.
Okay.
Let's do minus as first.
Let's do my,

1545
01:28:09.620 --> 01:28:13.460
um,
I have to text the Twitter.
Oh,
good Lord.
Yeah.

1546
01:28:13.461 --> 01:28:16.790
And the Texas t nine so is that the word t nine for that?
Yeah.

1547
01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:19.100
So it takes a while.
So you've got to really have in your mind what you want it,

1548
01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.880
what do you want to tweet?
And when I started tweeting,
uh,
I went to the old,

1549
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.310
it was my contacts with Twitter.
It's like,

1550
01:28:25.311 --> 01:28:27.920
oh it's four oh four four I think that's what it is.

1551
01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.090
And I sent a tweet like he used to used to tenant by texts and then they email

1552
01:28:33.091 --> 01:28:38.030
me saying,
I think you've been hacked
unless you meant to text a tweet out.

1553
01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:40.850
Which by the way,
when you're at the UFC and there's no data,

1554
01:28:40.851 --> 01:28:45.560
cause everyone's sharing data.
That's a little trick.
Texts to tweet.
Ooh,
yeah,

1555
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:47.900
you can get shit that you can't check everything,
but you can take something out.

1556
01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.730
Well yeah,
pictures are harder.
I think you,

1557
01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.660
it include a subject line or something.
But anyway,
that's difficult.

1558
01:28:53.690 --> 01:28:57.110
But I can get it done.
But the pro on the same side is that,

1559
01:28:57.111 --> 01:28:59.360
is that I cannot check any twit responses.

1560
01:29:00.140 --> 01:29:04.860
That's pro total pro in terms of giving me my time back.
Yeah.
Total pro.

1561
01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:09.810
I can't check it.
So why even get lost if I'm doing tweet responses slowly.

1562
01:29:09.811 --> 01:29:12.930
I was one of the big ones when I was in an elevator and the doors close.

1563
01:29:12.931 --> 01:29:16.650
Well come on.
Here's a negative.
What does that,

1564
01:29:16.680 --> 01:29:19.860
there's an amber alert in San Pedro,
California.
And you get it on your phone?

1565
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.380
I guess so.
Cause all old ladies have those.
They love that.

1566
01:29:22.381 --> 01:29:27.180
I didn't know about that.
What the fuck is this old?
Put It on a meeting.

1567
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:32.310
Old people love those sorts of rounds.
2000 well I'll just fucking pass it along.

1568
01:29:32.550 --> 01:29:34.200
A Great Nissan Altima.

1569
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:38.640
2006 California plates lic.
Oh,

1570
01:29:38.850 --> 01:29:43.560
I don't know what lic is.
Dash five you see F zero one zero if you see him,

1571
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.860
stop him.
Don't wait for the cops.
Yeah,

1572
01:29:46.861 --> 01:29:51.600
treat him like you would ted Bundy call it in,
but then no,
don't see us.
Listen,

1573
01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:55.080
we were joking.
College or child,
that mother Fucker,
you got a cell phone.

1574
01:29:55.081 --> 01:29:59.610
This is why.
Listen to his story first.
He might have a point.
No,
let's no story.

1575
01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:04.260
Sometimes when they go amber alert and they go,
his father abducted him.
I'm like,

1576
01:30:04.290 --> 01:30:05.790
hmm,
this citizen as cut and dry.

1577
01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:09.840
Then it was a terrible story about a woman who with this getting arrested,

1578
01:30:09.841 --> 01:30:13.410
she's taken her kid away,
her four year old,
I current her,
her husband Aaron,

1579
01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:18.350
some sort of a custody battle and she took the four year old away because he's

1580
01:30:18.370 --> 01:30:21.710
getting circumcised.
They wanted to get him circumcised.
Oh she said no phone.

1581
01:30:21.770 --> 01:30:25.630
She was like no fucking way.
And so they arrested her and it's just,
you know,

1582
01:30:25.690 --> 01:30:30.370
crazy story.
And I see people that are like pro and con and you know,

1583
01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.020
people do get dry is a,
an abduction.

1584
01:30:34.650 --> 01:30:37.860
No like you're still with a parent.
It's just not the weekend.

1585
01:30:37.980 --> 01:30:40.980
But there's still like there were threatening her with jail.
Like you know,

1586
01:30:40.981 --> 01:30:43.650
she was on the run.
She was like a fugitive.
I mean you can't do that.

1587
01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:47.160
But I would say let the cops handle that.
Cut Kids fucking Dick.

1588
01:30:47.190 --> 01:30:51.420
Either Jesus Christ.
What is that nonsense?
What is that nonsense?

1589
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:54.600
I don't want to hear any of this or prevents aids.
Shut the fuck up.

1590
01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.760
That is not preventing any age.

1591
01:30:56.790 --> 01:31:00.600
No matter what propaganda they throw your weight girl shaving their vaginas,

1592
01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.960
prevents a rent.
Say it's cause it's less shaping our,

1593
01:31:03.961 --> 01:31:08.520
he's Turkish shaved those buses.
That's not the way to prevent aids.

1594
01:31:08.610 --> 01:31:13.050
You fucking geniuses.
Dick wearing condom.
Come on,
be realistic.

1595
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:15.230
I'm talking to people.
Oh yeah.
That,
uh,

1596
01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:17.820
think they should cut their kids dick to make them not get aids.

1597
01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:19.300
That's not why people are doing it.

1598
01:31:19.300 --> 01:31:22.170
It's probably going to get an age anyway and most kind of me age from their
deck.

1599
01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:24.640
I'm just won't,
you know,
they get it from somebody else who's doing

1600
01:31:29.220 --> 01:31:33.520
the joke.
Here's another negative.
Huge,

1601
01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.310
Instagram is unusable.
I can do it.

1602
01:31:36.510 --> 01:31:40.530
I can do pictures only from my laptop.
I figured out a hack to get to do it.

1603
01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:42.480
I don't know that hack.
Tell me after there was,

1604
01:31:42.481 --> 01:31:44.860
I think it's going well or something like that.
Oh,
you have to get,

1605
01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:48.040
it's a service sucked down into the,
you can just Google it,
but yeah.
Sorry.
Um,

1606
01:31:49.410 --> 01:31:52.230
so there's that and you can't really check all your sponsors that much,

1607
01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:53.960
but that's good.
Right.
Yeah,

1608
01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:57.090
you could definitely get caught up in too much interaction.

1609
01:31:57.100 --> 01:32:00.150
You told me something when I told when I was doing this and you said something

1610
01:32:00.151 --> 01:32:01.780
that like I've quoted the people when you're like,

1611
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:04.660
well I couldn't live without Instagram and my thought was you did seven months

1612
01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:08.200
ago,
you lived without Instagram ads at the time.
You told me that.

1613
01:32:08.201 --> 01:32:12.400
So it's like the ideas of what we can and can't live without is like distorted.

1614
01:32:12.490 --> 01:32:15.040
I told you that I couldn't live with that answer.
You were half joking,

1615
01:32:15.041 --> 01:32:17.410
but like the idea of that,
I was definitely joke.

1616
01:32:17.411 --> 01:32:20.570
I mean of course you can live without it.
One thing that I would like,
wow.

1617
01:32:20.610 --> 01:32:23.010
You know you love Instagram.
You know what I love about it?
Well,

1618
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:26.590
it could write as much as you want.
You can write several paragraphs,

1619
01:32:26.710 --> 01:32:29.470
so can include photograph.
Now you can include a link,

1620
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:32.500
but if you have a photograph that I was like kind of a silly story to it and

1621
01:32:32.501 --> 01:32:35.200
it's kind of funny.
Or if you have something that means something to you,

1622
01:32:35.350 --> 01:32:39.880
he could actually fill out as long as you want.
You can read it or not read it.

1623
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:44.230
Sort of like,
yeah,
writing a podcast.
Absolutely.
I got on.
I don't believe in,

1624
01:32:44.290 --> 01:32:49.150
I'm not 140 I'm not editing shit.
I do a three hour podcasts.
Listen to it.

1625
01:32:49.151 --> 01:32:51.150
You don't,
whatever.
I love on skeptic tank.

1626
01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.540
When I'd finished interviewing somebody,
he's like,
oh,

1627
01:32:52.541 --> 01:32:53.610
so you're going to chop that down.

1628
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:56.620
What parts are you going to sound right now man,
unless I have to,

1629
01:32:56.621 --> 01:32:59.860
unless you set some incriminating guys.
Love to do that though.

1630
01:32:59.861 --> 01:33:03.360
They love to edit them and chop them down and get the right amount and make,

1631
01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:06.250
Dan was one of the things that Joey had a problem with with uh,

1632
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:09.820
the young lady that he was doing his last time.
There was some editing going on.

1633
01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.470
It's like,
why just leave it all Joey fucking Diaz.
Yeah,
yeah.

1634
01:33:13.740 --> 01:33:15.850
Figure out what to do.
I get the fuck out of here.

1635
01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:17.620
That was the hardest part of this not happening.

1636
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:21.960
What's getting the stories down to time but not lose?
Allow the comments like,

1637
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:23.410
yeah,
riff and we'll take it up.
Doesn't work.

1638
01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:26.860
But then at the same time it's like get to like have it.
Yeah,

1639
01:33:27.180 --> 01:33:30.370
so like Joey Diaz a story next week here this week he's,

1640
01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.770
he's gonna be the last one and that'll be the two act breaks because I was like,

1641
01:33:32.771 --> 01:33:36.430
guys,
you're not talking about it was,
it was,
you can lose up 30 seconds here,

1642
01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:39.570
a mistake,
a story,
but yet you can't so it's over.

1643
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:44.050
There's a commercial in the middle of it.
How long is it total that way?

1644
01:33:44.610 --> 01:33:48.460
What?
How long has it totally,
I think it's like 13 minutes long,

1645
01:33:49.930 --> 01:33:52.360
but there are like these need to be,
I think you're used to having standup on TV.

1646
01:33:52.361 --> 01:33:54.680
It's like seven.
I'm like,
well this ain't that.
Their stories,

1647
01:33:54.710 --> 01:33:58.660
the saint that they go as long as they go Joey stories or epic for your story.

1648
01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:00.760
We had to get right to ask them.
I was like,
listen,

1649
01:34:01.150 --> 01:34:04.270
I know the act breaks are seven and a half Max.
His story is eight and a half.

1650
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.980
Can you just like take the time off another outbreak?
And they were like,

1651
01:34:09.090 --> 01:34:11.430
let us check.
And they're like,
yeah,
look great.
Thank you.

1652
01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:16.250
Have a certain amount of minutes.
That's what it is.
You know?
That's,

1653
01:34:16.380 --> 01:34:19.060
that's something that's really interesting too because I watched you developed

1654
01:34:19.061 --> 01:34:23.110
that from doing it to annex room.
The little small rooms there on the side stage.

1655
01:34:23.260 --> 01:34:27.760
Yeah.
Was just like you were just trying to stretch.
Just fuck around and see,

1656
01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.250
see what happens.
See what exactly,
see what happens.

1657
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:33.220
My storytelling has gotten a lot better from doing it for five years.

1658
01:34:33.330 --> 01:34:36.610
Oh I would imagine.
Well guys like Joey Diaz or guys like Charlie Murphy.

1659
01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:38.770
How do you think they got so good at telling stories?

1660
01:34:38.770 --> 01:34:41.590
He told a lot of God damn stories.
You've been telling stories forever.

1661
01:34:41.670 --> 01:34:45.790
Like Charlie Murphy can captivate you with those God damn stories cause he's

1662
01:34:45.791 --> 01:34:47.860
been around dues that are good at it.

1663
01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:51.380
He picked up how to do it by doing his own stories over and over again.

1664
01:34:51.550 --> 01:34:54.290
You realize the rush you get when someone is telling,

1665
01:34:54.310 --> 01:34:57.070
like when Joey's telling a great story and we are howling laughing.

1666
01:34:57.290 --> 01:35:00.950
Even if it's just the three of us at five guys burger,
we're having a great time.

1667
01:35:00.970 --> 01:35:01.400
Yeah.

1668
01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:04.970
I mean it might as well be a packed room filled with a thousand that's a theory

1669
01:35:04.971 --> 01:35:05.451
behind it.

1670
01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:08.780
But it's like you've entertained people like this and you're a comedian so your

1671
01:35:08.781 --> 01:35:10.970
natural like when people say like what do you do?
You just talk.

1672
01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:13.400
It's like yeah but it's a comedian just talking.
That's what a podcast is.

1673
01:35:13.401 --> 01:35:15.680
So it's always way funnier a comic telling a story,

1674
01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:18.660
especially if they're good at it.
Like Joey ideas.
Yeah.

1675
01:35:18.810 --> 01:35:22.670
Joey has some of the most epic stories of all time.
He has a couple on there.

1676
01:35:22.671 --> 01:35:25.130
If you haven't seen them,
this is not happening.
Playlist,
go to youtube.

1677
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:27.530
Just look at all of how many does he have on your thing?

1678
01:35:27.531 --> 01:35:29.600
He's got to cause I was like yeah,

1679
01:35:29.601 --> 01:35:31.640
we're going to come back the second season and they were like do you want to

1680
01:35:31.641 --> 01:35:34.070
have people back that have already done the digital one for TV?

1681
01:35:34.071 --> 01:35:36.790
And I was like yeah,
dos and big journey of course and Rogan.

1682
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:39.530
Like what do you mean?
Yes,
yes,
we're just going to do that.

1683
01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:44.150
Like people have more than one story.
I said funny though that like when you,

1684
01:35:44.151 --> 01:35:48.590
when you dealing with like a giant company now we're dealing with a bunch of

1685
01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:50.780
people.
You used to just doing,
doing what I want,

1686
01:35:50.781 --> 01:35:54.170
what you want and doing what you think is funny when you do a podcast,

1687
01:35:54.171 --> 01:35:55.320
when you do anything.
Yeah.

1688
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:59.270
But like when you actually have to like cooperate with other people and you have

1689
01:35:59.271 --> 01:36:01.910
to have these conversations about the direction of the show,
that's all new.

1690
01:36:02.070 --> 01:36:05.260
That's very new.
Being a producer is newest.
Fuck yeah.

1691
01:36:05.261 --> 01:36:07.760
And I don't know how to do it and I don't know those rules and like you can't

1692
01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:10.550
tell this person then I'm like,
why?
They have to like help me through it.

1693
01:36:10.551 --> 01:36:12.350
But the thing is if as long as we,
what I found,

1694
01:36:12.351 --> 01:36:14.870
as long as you explain to someone with logic what you want to do,

1695
01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:17.270
then they'll go,
okay,
sure we'll do it that way.

1696
01:36:17.900 --> 01:36:20.660
Like when I was editing my special paid regular enough,

1697
01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:24.170
not the one that's coming out on Friday,
passive aggressive,
such a dvs,
uh,

1698
01:36:25.730 --> 01:36:30.020
Friday night,
midnight,
1159,
59.

1699
01:36:30.470 --> 01:36:33.530
And they were like,
oh,
we don't like this angle,
can you change it?
And I was like,

1700
01:36:33.531 --> 01:36:36.620
actually we use the other shot of that and there's somebody picking their nose

1701
01:36:36.621 --> 01:36:39.710
right by the stage,
something like that.
And so that's why we can't use that shot.

1702
01:36:39.740 --> 01:36:43.340
They go,
oh,
okay,
great.
So then use the one you want to use them.

1703
01:36:43.660 --> 01:36:46.550
If you just explained to them,
right,
like there's no fight,

1704
01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:47.750
then they're totally cool people.

1705
01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:51.440
Well this group of people that are running comedy central now are awesome artist

1706
01:36:51.441 --> 01:36:53.600
friendly.
That shit about letting you get eight and a half minutes.

1707
01:36:53.601 --> 01:36:57.590
It's like a sign of like,
cool,
you understand?
Let's update.

1708
01:36:57.591 --> 01:37:00.560
Some stuff will come into the future a little.
And they're all cool about it.

1709
01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:02.510
They were great through your show.

1710
01:37:02.511 --> 01:37:04.850
They were great through when I was filling my special,

1711
01:37:04.851 --> 01:37:06.500
they were great when you were filling your special.

1712
01:37:06.501 --> 01:37:09.650
They're just nice people and they,
they enjoy what's going on.

1713
01:37:09.650 --> 01:37:11.870
They ain't [inaudible] to their comedy fans.
So they kind of,

1714
01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.700
they're what they really want is something awesome and come out,
plug our,

1715
01:37:15.710 --> 01:37:20.380
we give them a plug,
Jonas.
And,
and they're great,
great people and keep them up.

1716
01:37:21.530 --> 01:37:25.430
Yeah,
it's awesome.
Yeah.
They're cool people to hang out with them.

1717
01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:28.010
This is a really good time for comedy,
man.

1718
01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.840
It's really two good time at the store.

1719
01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:32.390
That's a really good time on comedy central.
It's a really good time.

1720
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:35.750
There's a lot of funny fucking comics.
We just put up a show tomorrow night.

1721
01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:40.340
What's today?
Monday,
Wednesday night.
It's already sold out.
Sorry guys.
Sorry.

1722
01:37:40.341 --> 01:37:45.060
Bitches.
Yeah.
Diaz.
Um,
Brian Cowen,

1723
01:37:45.350 --> 01:37:49.520
Tony Hinchcliffe,
Ian Edwards in Maine.
People are calling from meetup debate.

1724
01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:53.060
Brendan Schaub on American sniper.
That's a good show though.

1725
01:37:53.420 --> 01:37:57.630
Fuck you and him debating Americans typer.
You debate anybody.

1726
01:37:57.631 --> 01:38:01.020
I need to get permission to 'em from you to release that video.

1727
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:06.150
You're disparaging arm heroes.
I didn't know.
I have no secrets.

1728
01:38:06.151 --> 01:38:07.440
There's no permissions for me.

1729
01:38:07.441 --> 01:38:12.030
I seem to remember that being a very controversial statement.
Oh really?

1730
01:38:12.031 --> 01:38:16.870
In their behalf and I'm not sure you want that public.
Well,

1731
01:38:16.890 --> 01:38:19.310
I said it was a Shitty fucking movie.
Everybody wants me to debate.

1732
01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.670
It's like you're not going to debate the acting.

1733
01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.800
I'm not going to bake Chris Kyle in any way.
I'm doing it.

1734
01:38:22.801 --> 01:38:25.470
The acting and the storytelling in that movie.
Hey Bro,
bro,

1735
01:38:25.471 --> 01:38:29.130
you gotta fucking guy's a hero,
bro.
Yeah,
but so what?

1736
01:38:29.131 --> 01:38:33.270
That fucking scene where he met his wife was garbage,
bro,
bro.
Bro.
Bro.
Respect.

1737
01:38:33.330 --> 01:38:33.601
Okay.

1738
01:38:33.601 --> 01:38:38.070
It's about the Christopher Columbus respected shoot that scene more than once.

1739
01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:42.570
Fucking Eastwood.
You old man.
What you and fucking,
what's his name?

1740
01:38:43.330 --> 01:38:47.610
[inaudible] go suck each other off.
And your old man camp.
Oh my goodness.

1741
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.990
Oh my gosh.

1742
01:38:48.991 --> 01:38:52.920
A wrinkled caucus in each other's mouth and go fucking support shitty comedy

1743
01:38:52.921 --> 01:38:57.630
again.
You guys are garbage Darya.
They've lost it.
Unforgiven was amazing.

1744
01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:00.700
Let's not take that away from him.
How old was he when he made unforgiven?

1745
01:39:01.080 --> 01:39:04.130
1520 years ago.
It was great and it was a,

1746
01:39:04.150 --> 01:39:07.200
it was a culmination of all the stuff he had done to the point.
To that point.

1747
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:09.690
He made a real western.
You're upset with our,

1748
01:39:09.750 --> 01:39:12.000
with Howard stern because he said that shit about podcasting.

1749
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:14.550
That's the new thing.
I'm upset with Howard stern over.

1750
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:16.890
It just shows what a fucking,
how much he's lost touch.

1751
01:39:16.891 --> 01:39:18.870
Like that's not the way you become a radio DJ started.

1752
01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:23.130
No one wants to become a radio DJ who's doing podcast.
That's not our end goal.

1753
01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:25.650
He might be doing that though.
He's a very clever guy.

1754
01:39:25.651 --> 01:39:30.651
He might be doing that just to get people to talk shit and for losers.

1755
01:39:30.751 --> 01:39:33.420
So that means anyone who listens to a podcast and listen to Howard Stern,

1756
01:39:33.421 --> 01:39:34.320
just so you know how it's turned,

1757
01:39:34.350 --> 01:39:36.570
called you a loser for listening to podcasts as well.

1758
01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.390
You gotta know how to take it to an act break.
What?
No,
you don't.

1759
01:39:39.391 --> 01:39:43.470
You can just not go to an act break the fuck are you talking about?

1760
01:39:43.740 --> 01:39:47.730
Take it back to the thirties I think he was trying to fuck with people.

1761
01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:48.900
I really do.
No,

1762
01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:50.970
I think he doesn't like the and where are you going to make your pennies?

1763
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.120
And he goes,
Corolla shouldn't be in podcasts.
They should be doing radio.

1764
01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.300
Like you just don't even know what it is.
You're commenting on shit.

1765
01:39:57.301 --> 01:39:59.160
You don't even know what it is.
I don't know man.

1766
01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:02.790
I hear that from a guy like that.
He's too clever.
He was too Glover.

1767
01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:06.630
I think he's probably,
I don't know.
I think he's probably fucking with people,

1768
01:40:06.690 --> 01:40:09.660
Dude.
At the same time dancing with the stars.
What does that a prank?

1769
01:40:09.661 --> 01:40:11.640
I think it's chance for the stars.
America's got talent,

1770
01:40:11.670 --> 01:40:16.330
whatever garbage show he likes it.
He likes giving people.
When he talks about it,

1771
01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:19.620
it genuinely seems like he's enjoying it.
Giving people the opportunity,

1772
01:40:19.621 --> 01:40:21.660
like some of those people that come out of that show are actually really

1773
01:40:21.661 --> 01:40:24.770
talented,
cool jugglers and stuff.
I don't know.
I've never obliged.

1774
01:40:24.790 --> 01:40:28.290
What are you doing that show for Tom Cotter?
Tom Cotter standup comic.

1775
01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:31.440
He's the guy that I came up with in Boston like way back in the day.

1776
01:40:31.500 --> 01:40:34.440
Hold on a second and you should know,
but I don't want Tom caught her at all,

1777
01:40:34.441 --> 01:40:38.010
but there's no way you're going to defend that show by saying Tam,
fucking Katar,

1778
01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:42.720
he's been fucking shitty since 84 there's no way you're going to say that as an

1779
01:40:42.721 --> 01:40:46.710
example of something good coming out of that show.
Fucking cool dancers.
Yeah,

1780
01:40:46.711 --> 01:40:50.400
I'll give you that.
Cool.
You do?
I like Bob Carter.
I can't say any bad.
No,

1781
01:40:50.401 --> 01:40:53.410
you can't because you know him and like him,
but I can cause I've never him.

1782
01:40:53.470 --> 01:40:54.470
He's a beautiful human being.

1783
01:40:54.670 --> 01:40:57.790
I was a little kid watching live for the laugh factory on Saturday night.

1784
01:40:57.791 --> 01:41:01.300
I was like,
who's this fucking cheese ball host?
How dare you?

1785
01:41:01.301 --> 01:41:05.770
That's really amazing,
Jonathan,
dare you.
How dare you are.
You should fear.

1786
01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.260
You gave him a TV show.
The mother fucker goes on a rampage.

1787
01:41:09.520 --> 01:41:13.880
Paul's out attacking Howard stern attack.
Attack Hotter.

1788
01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:17.290
When's the last time he broke up real musician anymore?

1789
01:41:18.220 --> 01:41:21.940
I don't think he ever did that.
Did he really?
Yeah.
Bands like sole coughing.

1790
01:41:21.941 --> 01:41:25.090
I remember discovering them through Howard stern is a good band.

1791
01:41:25.091 --> 01:41:27.520
Your rights stern.
Oh listen to rock music,

1792
01:41:27.521 --> 01:41:31.630
but now he's fucking 104 and hundred and four year olds don't have their finger

1793
01:41:31.631 --> 01:41:34.180
on the pulse.
I don't think he's at all.
That's why.

1794
01:41:34.210 --> 01:41:36.910
That's why the guy from side live,
he just like,
well,

1795
01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:40.000
hire a young black people just to hire somebody that is young.

1796
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:44.350
I think I'm honestly,
this is my take on it.
I want to be completely objective.

1797
01:41:44.650 --> 01:41:49.210
I think what he's doing is what he enjoys.
Yeah.
This is who he is now.

1798
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.193
It's just who he is now.

1799
01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:55.330
We can't want a guy to be who we thought he was or who he used to be.

1800
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:58.870
There's nothing Comedians,
uh,
athletes,
musicians.

1801
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:02.710
No one keeps up at the high level.
They perform at all the time they fade.

1802
01:42:02.770 --> 01:42:06.580
But this is where I think you're wrong because starring has really good

1803
01:42:06.581 --> 01:42:11.320
interviews.
They're really good.
Still new ones.
Very good.
Okay,
well then kid rock,

1804
01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:12.940
he's very good.
He's,

1805
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.250
I think he's one of the very best ever at,
yeah.

1806
01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:22.030
At like getting the interview.
All right,
well then it's a good interviewer still.

1807
01:42:22.031 --> 01:42:25.480
He's still very good man.
He might have some ideas that I don't agree with.

1808
01:42:25.481 --> 01:42:29.170
Like the podcasters are losers,
but he's still like that guy is like,

1809
01:42:29.530 --> 01:42:34.530
if you go back and look at all the radio influences like that guys,

1810
01:42:35.201 --> 01:42:40.140
the number one radio guy,
oh,
hold on Sam.
Kinison Houston,
like Sam Kinison.

1811
01:42:40.141 --> 01:42:43.540
It was like,
this guy's legit funny and now he likes fucking one liner comics.

1812
01:42:43.860 --> 01:42:47.500
Well,
safe one liner comics.
I don't know.
I bet he's still,

1813
01:42:47.740 --> 01:42:50.650
they're funny comics too.
I don't,
I don't buy it man.
I mean,

1814
01:42:50.651 --> 01:42:54.290
I don't talk to the dude on a regular basis.
I haven't seen him in a long time.

1815
01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:56.520
You can get the black keys.
I was like,
man,
I don't get it.
Why?

1816
01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:59.050
Why do we want to have them on really irrelevant man.

1817
01:42:59.051 --> 01:43:02.350
They had to force them into his playing his birthday party because he was like,

1818
01:43:02.351 --> 01:43:04.780
I just wouldn't,
he wouldn't play them.
I you sure about that.

1819
01:43:05.770 --> 01:43:08.290
That's who played his birthday party,
right?
Yeah,
but he showed it.

1820
01:43:08.330 --> 01:43:10.240
He didn't want them and I just wouldn't have them.
No,

1821
01:43:10.241 --> 01:43:13.480
I'm not sure about anything,
but that's what I heard.
Oh,
that I heard shit.

1822
01:43:14.050 --> 01:43:17.290
That's what I hear from people who listened to him.
I don't know man.

1823
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:19.480
If it wasn't for him,

1824
01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:23.070
it wasn't for all the shit that he went through with the FCC and all the shirts

1825
01:43:23.540 --> 01:43:28.240
and then he tries to say that ONA went too far having a homeless guy on and it's

1826
01:43:28.241 --> 01:43:30.880
like,
dude,
fuck you.
You are relevant piece of shit.
Well,

1827
01:43:30.881 --> 01:43:34.000
you know what I'm saying on the side of freedom only when it's your freedom of

1828
01:43:34.001 --> 01:43:37.120
speech.
No one else's,
his enemy and his,

1829
01:43:37.150 --> 01:43:39.400
that was his idea was that his enemies,

1830
01:43:39.430 --> 01:43:43.750
he would go after with all of his weapons,
weapons,
weapon as a mortar,

1831
01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:47.380
mortgaging his fucking art and what he believes in that people should be allowed

1832
01:43:47.381 --> 01:43:50.950
to say whatever they want.
That is what it's all about,
right?

1833
01:43:50.951 --> 01:43:52.100
I mean it's got to kind of be

1834
01:43:52.100 --> 01:43:54.320
<v 1>that and it's got to kind of stand up for itself.</v>

1835
01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:55.970
You've got to say like fuck those guys,

1836
01:43:55.971 --> 01:43:58.250
but of course Israel and say what they want,
but please everyone,

1837
01:43:58.251 --> 01:44:01.370
do not listen to them because they suck.
That's what you should say.
Hmm.

1838
01:44:02.240 --> 01:44:05.150
Or just shouldn't say that one too far.
You can't say certain things like,

1839
01:44:05.151 --> 01:44:07.760
come on man,
do you want to far a hundred times.
And it was great.

1840
01:44:07.830 --> 01:44:08.960
And other line with moved.

1841
01:44:09.050 --> 01:44:14.050
Do you think that's because like in those days when they had time slots that the

1842
01:44:14.511 --> 01:44:18.320
time slot was the king and maybe that's why we're not like that at all.

1843
01:44:18.660 --> 01:44:22.310
You think about it all the funny drive time was huge to get that all of our

1844
01:44:22.311 --> 01:44:22.551
friends,

1845
01:44:22.551 --> 01:44:25.580
what all of our friends have podcasts and we're always on all of our friends

1846
01:44:25.581 --> 01:44:28.090
podcasts.
I've been on yours,
you've got ideas.

1847
01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:31.820
I've been ideas is we're all like on each other's podcasts Dunkin's last week.

1848
01:44:31.850 --> 01:44:34.330
Yeah.
And this is never like have a,

1849
01:44:35.060 --> 01:44:38.160
it's not a competitive thing at all.
Like it doesn't even come into play.

1850
01:44:38.161 --> 01:44:40.310
It's like,
Hey,
we all have successful podcasts,

1851
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:43.040
this is fun and we just keep doing podcasts.

1852
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:46.460
And no one's worried that somehow or another if they download the skeptic tank

1853
01:44:46.461 --> 01:44:50.810
that they're not gonna Download Duncan trussell's family hours catch up with all

1854
01:44:50.811 --> 01:44:53.690
the old ones and they move on to the next podcast.
Exactly.

1855
01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:56.210
And there's enough people,
there's a lot of people.

1856
01:44:56.211 --> 01:44:58.460
And the key isn't controlling the people that are there.

1857
01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:03.230
The key is promoting as much good shit as possible so that more people show up

1858
01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.680
and then everybody's happy.
Right?
Like this idea that you have to be,

1859
01:45:06.681 --> 01:45:08.870
but when there was one morning show,

1860
01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:12.590
you know one guy got the morning shift and you have rankings,

1861
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:15.500
we're the number one in our market that got all the money.

1862
01:45:15.860 --> 01:45:17.920
Of course the smart guys going to want to give her the money,

1863
01:45:18.240 --> 01:45:19.970
so we're doing better and it's like rankings.

1864
01:45:20.120 --> 01:45:22.670
Those iTunes rankings that came out and people start doing podcasts.

1865
01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:25.730
Everyone's interested at first and then it became like whatever,
who cares?

1866
01:45:25.731 --> 01:45:27.730
I have this many downloads.
I want to get more.
Yeah,

1867
01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:29.570
I want to get more people to listen.

1868
01:45:29.571 --> 01:45:31.820
And it's like that's a different world like that.

1869
01:45:31.821 --> 01:45:34.730
That's a different world of competition,
different worlds,
and you're not,

1870
01:45:34.790 --> 01:45:35.241
you can't,

1871
01:45:35.241 --> 01:45:38.750
can't accept this new world where people don't care is it is definitely a new

1872
01:45:38.751 --> 01:45:39.910
world.
There's all,

1873
01:45:39.950 --> 01:45:42.800
there's a lot of people listening to podcasts and especially when you have

1874
01:45:42.801 --> 01:45:45.560
something happen to us too.
We're going to become a relevant,
oh,

1875
01:45:45.561 --> 01:45:46.394
I don't know about that.

1876
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:49.250
I think you'll be relevant with people that are interested in what you have to

1877
01:45:49.251 --> 01:45:52.280
say.
Maybe that's what it is that you change.

1878
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:55.990
You change just for comedians where it's like when you're 60 and irrelevant,

1879
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:58.700
the 60 year olds,
six year olds don't go out to the comedy clubs.
Okay,

1880
01:45:58.701 --> 01:46:01.790
but here's the,
you're still relevant to Europe.
No audience.
Okay.

1881
01:46:01.850 --> 01:46:06.050
Here's the argument against that is dom I rera diamond Herrera is not just

1882
01:46:06.051 --> 01:46:09.830
relevant.
He's just funny as ever.
Yeah,
that's true.
Murders it.
Good point.

1883
01:46:09.860 --> 01:46:10.940
I saw him the other night.

1884
01:46:10.941 --> 01:46:15.050
We did kill Tony together like one the other night for a few months ago and he

1885
01:46:15.051 --> 01:46:19.160
was sharp as I've ever seen him really crushing off the top of his head.

1886
01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:23.670
Hilarious.
Vicious,
hilarious.
Self deprecating.

1887
01:46:23.930 --> 01:46:28.300
We just monstrous.
Wow.
Just smashed it.
Smashed it.
We were howling laughing.

1888
01:46:28.320 --> 01:46:30.050
He's so good at that.
Off the cuff stuff.

1889
01:46:30.230 --> 01:46:33.410
Especially he's talking to like young Comedians,
you know?
It was,
it was,

1890
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:37.580
it was excellent.
So there's,
there's some guys that just stay funny.
I,

1891
01:46:37.581 --> 01:46:41.450
Dom Irrera just stayed funny.
He never stopped being funny.
He just stayed funny.

1892
01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:46.340
Carlin's last few years was a downturn.
I think his health was a big issue.

1893
01:46:46.520 --> 01:46:50.070
I think when you,
you're struggling with your health,
so leave society more.

1894
01:46:50.530 --> 01:46:52.770
<v 0>How you going to talk about being of the people when you just like,</v>

1895
01:46:52.771 --> 01:46:56.040
you're not of the people they've flown coach and fucking 15 years,

1896
01:46:56.041 --> 01:46:58.800
20 years coach,
right.
So whatever it is,

1897
01:46:58.801 --> 01:47:01.260
but it's like you've never taken the subway.
If you do a joke about the subway,

1898
01:47:01.261 --> 01:47:04.200
would you have no idea what it's like now.
If it's true,
you know,

1899
01:47:04.560 --> 01:47:06.930
I wonder how much,
I mean he used to hang out with the comedy store.

1900
01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:11.940
I really regret not talking to him.
Not too tempting to talk to him.

1901
01:47:12.030 --> 01:47:15.090
I said hello.
It was very friendly.
He said hi people.

1902
01:47:15.270 --> 01:47:17.430
Whenever I heard people call him,
Mr Carly's like short,

1903
01:47:17.490 --> 01:47:20.670
please just call me George.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It was kind of cool.
He was,

1904
01:47:20.671 --> 01:47:24.480
he was a really like a comic.
He took me out 20 bucks did man,

1905
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:27.630
I'm sure he did.
He seemed very friendly when I said hello to him.

1906
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:28.990
I just real quick,

1907
01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:33.310
somebody must deal with all the time people coming out to them river revering

1908
01:47:33.330 --> 01:47:36.120
him.
Yeah.
I just had to get away from him before I said something stupid,

1909
01:47:36.480 --> 01:47:39.300
but I was just,
it was psyched.
I was psyched that he was there.
I was like,
wow,

1910
01:47:39.301 --> 01:47:41.820
that's George fucking Carlin.
Holy Shit.
You know,

1911
01:47:41.821 --> 01:47:45.910
there's like a mount Rushmore of comedy.
He's,
there's the,
uh,

1912
01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:50.730
the date rape Guy Guy.
Just start calling him that to take that guy.

1913
01:47:50.731 --> 01:47:52.950
Carlin,
it's fucked up man.

1914
01:47:52.951 --> 01:47:57.300
But you got to kind of remove him from the Mount Rushmore of this crap.
No,
no.

1915
01:47:57.301 --> 01:47:58.800
You do not have to do that.

1916
01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.960
You cannot deny someone the hall of fame because of off the field actions.

1917
01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:05.970
That's got nothing to do with it.

1918
01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:10.040
I just lost fucking the dead girl's made him funnier.
They weren't dead.

1919
01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:11.660
They were out cold,
close to the deck,

1920
01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:14.910
out cold girls made him funny or then that's a performance enhancing drug.

1921
01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:18.090
But otherwise has nothing to do with his act.

1922
01:48:18.330 --> 01:48:21.910
But pod is a performance enhancing drug when it comes to that.
So Asterix.

1923
01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:25.210
So Asterix.
Prior Carlin

1924
01:48:26.990 --> 01:48:30.160
don't ask Cosby cause he probably,
he probably did smoke pot too.
What?

1925
01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.260
It came and now he goes,
I'd like to admit pot.
Oh Wow.
People be like,

1926
01:48:33.700 --> 01:48:34.560
I have a confession.

1927
01:48:34.590 --> 01:48:39.590
I smoked pot when I do feel bad about some of the things I did.

1928
01:48:41.521 --> 01:48:42.354
I want to talk about those things.

1929
01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:47.160
I'm willing to admit bad things and that's all I'm willing to admit.

1930
01:48:47.161 --> 01:48:49.340
So it must be all there is much.

1931
01:48:49.470 --> 01:48:53.820
That was the worst borderline black person slash bill Cosby impression that we

1932
01:48:53.821 --> 01:48:56.370
both did.
Horrible,
horrible impression.

1933
01:48:57.270 --> 01:49:01.260
I can't do it as much as I can do.
I'm not,
I can't do coffee.

1934
01:49:01.610 --> 01:49:04.980
I remember Thomas Ward,
he'd do a fucking cop.
He said God's going to pour.
Yeah,

1935
01:49:04.981 --> 01:49:08.700
that's right.
That's right.
You did fuck it.
But he played,
caused me to point.

1936
01:49:08.701 --> 01:49:12.450
I saw it on the shelves at the Old Hustler.
Well,
he used to do it at the store.

1937
01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:16.950
He used to do a Crosby at the store.
God crazy.
Hey,
we're doing,

1938
01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:19.410
if you want to come,
you can just pop in if you want,

1939
01:49:19.411 --> 01:49:22.200
but we're doing comedy store stories and the belly room when a couple of

1940
01:49:22.201 --> 01:49:24.550
Tuesdays in a couple of Tuesdays.
Yeah.

1941
01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:27.460
Let me know in advance if I can make it and it's just gonna be Illinois.

1942
01:49:27.570 --> 01:49:29.460
I'll go ask dom.
I just got the idea when you said it.

1943
01:49:30.050 --> 01:49:32.390
Tell him fucking shit that's happened at the store.
Yeah.

1944
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.100
This is probably some really funny stories.

1945
01:49:34.101 --> 01:49:36.750
I'll just get a bunch of people haven't remind you of other stuff.

1946
01:49:37.140 --> 01:49:38.070
I wonder if anybody's gonna.

1947
01:49:38.250 --> 01:49:41.490
I would like to hear Carla go tell his ghost or your various coasts story.

1948
01:49:41.880 --> 01:49:43.850
I wonder how much of his bullshit,
I'd like to sit down,
dude,

1949
01:49:43.860 --> 01:49:47.190
down to a lot of technical dancers,
all of it.
Because no ghosts.

1950
01:49:47.620 --> 01:49:50.710
If you told me to go story,
unless it ends with someone pulled off a sheet,

1951
01:49:50.890 --> 01:49:52.300
then I have some theories.

1952
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:55.800
<v 1>I'll share them with you.
Okay.
Um,</v>

1953
01:49:55.830 --> 01:49:59.520
Carlo has this great story and I remember he told it one night at the comedy

1954
01:49:59.521 --> 01:50:01.830
store.
There's some special night,
I forget what the night was all about,

1955
01:50:01.831 --> 01:50:03.330
but it wasn't just a comedy night.

1956
01:50:03.331 --> 01:50:06.030
There was like a movie they were playing or something like that.
And uh,

1957
01:50:06.031 --> 01:50:09.630
I was in the back of the room and Carlo had the audience captivated and he was

1958
01:50:09.631 --> 01:50:14.631
telling the story about how when he was broke and when he was down on his luck

1959
01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:19.980
and is his comedy career was going nowhere.
You know,
maybe he's personal life.

1960
01:50:19.981 --> 01:50:21.900
He had issues,
like everything was all fucked up,

1961
01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:25.320
but he showed up at the comedy store cause he had the keys cause he worked there

1962
01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:27.480
and he said,
I'm just going to sleep on the stage,
man.

1963
01:50:27.481 --> 01:50:29.790
This is where I'm going to fucking make my dreams happen.

1964
01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:32.700
I'm going to sleep right here on this stage.
And so,
uh,

1965
01:50:32.730 --> 01:50:35.410
he said he went to sleep and he's lying on the stage.
Um,

1966
01:50:35.430 --> 01:50:38.340
and I'm so sorry if he gets offended in me telling a story,

1967
01:50:38.580 --> 01:50:41.640
he tells it way better.
You want to hear it from him.
Um,

1968
01:50:41.670 --> 01:50:46.620
and he said that he was lying there on the stage and that he heard the door
open.

1969
01:50:47.290 --> 01:50:50.700
Yeah.
And he waited and he didn't hear anything and it's totally dark.

1970
01:50:50.730 --> 01:50:55.170
Shuts all the lights out so I can go to sleep.
And he says,
uh,
Hey,
uh,
it's me,

1971
01:50:55.171 --> 01:50:59.610
Carl,
I'm in here.
I let myself in.
I got a,
I got kicked out of my apartment,
right.

1972
01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:02.190
It doesn't hear anything.
It's total darkness out there.

1973
01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:06.630
And he hears like a little thump or click like you can tell that someone's in

1974
01:51:06.631 --> 01:51:11.460
the room.
He's like,
hello eight sites,
uh,
Carla bows here,
you know,

1975
01:51:11.461 --> 01:51:14.660
so,
and then he says he hears like chairs moving like,

1976
01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:19.530
like someone's coming towards him and he can't see cause the rooms totally dark.

1977
01:51:19.650 --> 01:51:24.150
So he opens his eyes and he lifts his head up and something grabs his ankle and

1978
01:51:24.151 --> 01:51:29.151
pulls him off the stage and knocked to the ground and then here is running.

1979
01:51:29.910 --> 01:51:33.000
And then he hears a door slam and that's it.

1980
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:37.350
And he said he never saw anybody and he tells it to you and it makes the fucking

1981
01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:41.550
hairs on your forum.
I love those stories,

1982
01:51:41.740 --> 01:51:44.910
but this is why I love it.
He was doing drugs with Sam Kinison.

1983
01:51:45.290 --> 01:51:49.390
<v 0>Okay.
Yeah.
Well,
you talked to mark Marin,
revere him,
Mark Marin,
Sam Kinison story.</v>

1984
01:51:49.391 --> 01:51:53.860
He was hearing voices in his head for a year.
Right.
That's how hard cards door.

1985
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:55.060
Like I saw things fall.
I'm like,
well,

1986
01:51:55.061 --> 01:51:58.480
I've seen comics hide back there waiting to scare other comics,

1987
01:51:58.930 --> 01:52:00.070
so what's more likely,

1988
01:52:00.190 --> 01:52:03.940
especially if they knew that you were going back there and your checks or yeah,

1989
01:52:03.941 --> 01:52:04.774
exactly.

1990
01:52:05.590 --> 01:52:09.140
Or comic fucking with somebody once more like it's 100% of comic fucker.

1991
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:10.613
That's exactly what it is.

1992
01:52:10.630 --> 01:52:13.540
But it's a great story because that's in his world that that's reality.

1993
01:52:13.570 --> 01:52:14.403
It was a great,

1994
01:52:14.550 --> 01:52:16.880
<v 1>I'm telling you,
man,
when he told it to me in my fucking yeah.</v>

1995
01:52:16.881 --> 01:52:20.070
In his mind that that is what happened.
He's decided to look no further.

1996
01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:25.470
This Sam died too.
It was like tough.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1997
01:52:25.471 --> 01:52:29.920
That's awful.
That's awful shit man.
That's all bull shit you got.
Here's the,

1998
01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:34.560
have you seen the LSC story yet?
Who Always Duke?
No,
just Houston comic.

1999
01:52:35.260 --> 01:52:38.320
Talking about finding other comics and stuff.
Yeah.
Funny.

2000
01:52:38.340 --> 01:52:41.640
It's on your show and your show.
Yeah.
There's some

2001
01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:47.150
<v 0>see somebody doing like a good story hit Larson.
J T has of course James.</v>

2002
01:52:47.151 --> 01:52:51.350
Amazing.
Bert big j.
Stories are really good.
He's a natural storyteller.

2003
01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:54.800
I really enjoy.
I really enjoy watching that guy do your show.

2004
01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.680
I enjoy talking to them.
It's a natural like storyteller type dude.

2005
01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:01.180
Great at referring to,
but he'd stay.

2006
01:53:01.190 --> 01:53:03.250
Then it goes into a story and it's like everyone's like the waitresses.

2007
01:53:03.270 --> 01:53:06.200
Everyone's like looking and listening and it's like they're just fucking great.

2008
01:53:06.620 --> 01:53:10.350
That when he told about the dog was the one I wanted to do like two years ago on

2009
01:53:10.351 --> 01:53:13.250
this show.
Oh really?
Yeah,
but he was like,
no,
I think I use it for a special,

2010
01:53:13.251 --> 01:53:15.530
but then no one gave him a special and he's like,
okay,
I'll put it on something.

2011
01:53:15.680 --> 01:53:20.600
I was like,
thank you.
Yes.
Awesome.
That's a good idea of man.
Yeah.
Hey,
but he,

2012
01:53:20.601 --> 01:53:21.500
he's one of those guys,

2013
01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:24.650
like there's certain guys that are really funny and they're their material.

2014
01:53:24.651 --> 01:53:28.760
Like the subject matter becomes like just a scaffolding for funny,

2015
01:53:28.790 --> 01:53:31.820
for funny Shaklee.
And that's like with him,
like that guy,

2016
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:34.100
she just keep putting things out as much as possible.

2017
01:53:34.101 --> 01:53:38.180
Just build up this metal crowd work album.
It's got podcasts and stuff,

2018
01:53:38.181 --> 01:53:41.090
but it's like,
yeah,
he's more clips.
Yeah,

2019
01:53:41.150 --> 01:53:44.360
there's a good crop of those guys out there now.

2020
01:53:44.450 --> 01:53:48.130
It was like a real good crop of like really funny guys who'd been Metzker,

2021
01:53:48.140 --> 01:53:50.510
which I don't know if just because I made friends with them from the nasty shows

2022
01:53:50.511 --> 01:53:53.330
in Montreal.
I did it one year,
then two years later I did it again.

2023
01:53:53.331 --> 01:53:56.810
And those guys were like the,
at my level guys.
Why you hung out the most?

2024
01:53:56.811 --> 01:54:00.170
You know Justin look to one year,
but like,
um,

2025
01:54:01.250 --> 01:54:03.740
I just think they're amazing but I don't know if it's cause I'm friends with

2026
01:54:03.741 --> 01:54:04.101
them or not,

2027
01:54:04.101 --> 01:54:08.390
but they're both like on a such a high level and Metzker well it's like when I

2028
01:54:08.391 --> 01:54:09.980
was saying about you when you first started,

2029
01:54:09.981 --> 01:54:12.680
it's just a matter of just putting in the time to get people to see you.

2030
01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:15.200
I see you guys funny.
They put in the time,

2031
01:54:15.201 --> 01:54:18.530
they do a lot of sets to keep working on their act.
Everything you do,

2032
01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:21.950
whether it's playing the harmonica or fucking have you put enough time and

2033
01:54:21.951 --> 01:54:25.170
enough time and you just get better at it,
you get better.
She the video,

2034
01:54:26.500 --> 01:54:28.640
which one?
He,
he uh,
he broke down crying.

2035
01:54:28.650 --> 01:54:31.970
He said that some deal fall through and so he's on a podcast and cried about it.

2036
01:54:31.971 --> 01:54:34.610
So then on his podcast that he's been doing for the Legion of skanks,

2037
01:54:34.611 --> 01:54:38.270
they had a bunch of comics like record videos for them making fun of him crying.

2038
01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.400
Dude,
can you find the one?
I made them play that for a job.

2039
01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:48.020
So I just sat there for like 45 minutes trying to come with like something good

2040
01:54:48.021 --> 01:54:52.340
to like,
like therefore him like a 62nd video and then,
Oh,
here's my point.

2041
01:54:52.341 --> 01:54:55.400
Lewis put it up online.
That's why I don't care to put it best snipers shit.
Okay,

2042
01:54:55.470 --> 01:54:58.490
I got,
I got asked the girl if it's okay.
You're holding guys.
You would shower.

2043
01:54:58.730 --> 01:55:02.270
Champix you've got your fucking mind.
Alright,
listen,

2044
01:55:02.350 --> 01:55:05.450
notable President Barack Obama.
I can't talk right now.

2045
01:55:05.451 --> 01:55:08.680
I've got to make a video for big j overson person.

2046
01:55:11.140 --> 01:55:13.990
Dude can't use words like that.
It's a homophobic word.

2047
01:55:16.320 --> 01:55:19.970
Whatever we all learn to talk to you later.
Paki Paki

2048
01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:25.030
<v 4>what's that called?
I heard about the deal.
That fucking sucks,
Bro.
Fucking sucks.</v>

2049
01:55:25.040 --> 01:55:26.180
This business

2050
01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.830
<v 0>never stopped shitting on your fucking grave.
I get it.</v>

2051
01:55:31.770 --> 01:55:32.221
<v 4>I get it.</v>

2052
01:55:32.221 --> 01:55:35.490
I got a deal right now with my own billboard being up on sunset boulevard,

2053
01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:40.270
giant 30 foot picture,
my face staring down sunset from my,

2054
01:55:40.490 --> 01:55:43.920
from my old apartment building.
I'm not going to

2055
01:55:43.980 --> 01:55:48.020
<v 5>comment.
Go cry to your mother beds.</v>

2056
01:55:50.340 --> 01:55:50.710
<v 1>His,</v>

2057
01:55:50.710 --> 01:55:55.710
it was a business and his big J.

2058
01:55:59.370 --> 01:56:03.610
Oh no,
no.
This is wrong.
That's wrong,

2059
01:56:03.650 --> 01:56:04.620
and I think it's illegal.

2060
01:56:04.621 --> 01:56:07.470
We probably shouldn't have showed that you're going to get in trouble.

2061
01:56:08.550 --> 01:56:10.710
He made a dog touch your ass with his face.

2062
01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:13.610
I think it's sexual to say it wasn't sexual to you.

2063
01:56:15.060 --> 01:56:19.140
It seemed like it was some sort of BCL.
We should end the podcast.

2064
01:56:20.010 --> 01:56:22.740
We're going to have to edit that out.
We'll be back.
We'll be right back

2065
01:56:25.620 --> 01:56:30.060
in jail for having a dog liquor.
But I wonder if it's like totally legal

2066
01:56:31.620 --> 01:56:34.980
to do anything about it.
But you know Paul,
it was very rapey.

2067
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:38.940
He didn't want to go [inaudible].
They didn't want to be there for sure.

2068
01:56:38.941 --> 01:56:43.440
It was like,
Oh,
I'm not opening my mouth on this,
but here's what we say.

2069
01:56:43.620 --> 01:56:47.910
His personal freedom is not worth as much as how funny that was.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2070
01:56:47.911 --> 01:56:51.360
And that's what a comic,
we'll say in a peta person won't exactly.

2071
01:56:51.990 --> 01:56:54.210
Peter showing up at your shows before they show up in mind.

2072
01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:59.190
Peter feedings at first to get pumped up,
shooting them an email,
thanking them,

2073
01:56:59.191 --> 01:57:00.600
lick your ass.
I texted

2074
01:57:00.610 --> 01:57:04.660
<v 0>you so fucking cool it.
They kill a lot of animals themselves.
Oh yeah.</v>

2075
01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:09.670
They put,
you know,
cats and dogs down.
I'm sure they don't want to Dunkin alone.

2076
01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:14.030
One time when he was probably dating some Vegan,
there was like 10,
12 years ago,

2077
01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:16.220
he knew Peter,
I think his brother might've worked for Pete Up.

2078
01:57:16.221 --> 01:57:19.100
We went down to the store,

2079
01:57:19.130 --> 01:57:23.740
some high price store in Beverly Hills and Prada store and there was,
there was,

2080
01:57:23.990 --> 01:57:27.590
they were selling like sealskin coat or something,
a baby seal skin.

2081
01:57:27.770 --> 01:57:30.710
So somebody dressed up like a c and we beat the fuck out of them with rubber,

2082
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:34.010
with rubber bands.
Oh,
how rude.
And sprayed blood on them.
It was great.

2083
01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.410
So much fun right in front of the product store.
And they're like,
well,

2084
01:57:36.440 --> 01:57:39.890
we didn't do it.
We just think they give us whatever they give us.

2085
01:57:39.891 --> 01:57:43.700
I'm just the manager here.
That's so rude.
It was great.
It was so much fun.

2086
01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.580
Press came.
So you are committed to never,

2087
01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.960
never,
um,
compromising and becoming a different person.

2088
01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:58.340
Like maybe perhaps someone who could host a talent show on television committee.

2089
01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:01.710
Here's your talent show.
But here's the deal.
All eventually get swayed.

2090
01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:04.090
He thinks I'll become old and I'll lose my touch and then I'll be,

2091
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:06.050
I see everybody do it.

2092
01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:10.490
Eventually they just start coasting and they do shit that it's like it's good

2093
01:58:10.491 --> 01:58:14.150
enough.
I don't think so.
Dude did this one for the money.
You don't have to.
No,

2094
01:58:14.151 --> 01:58:18.450
you don't have to.
But a lot of people do it be Koski never did it.
Mm.

2095
01:58:19.250 --> 01:58:22.490
He was poor in the end.
Well maybe not in the Andy.
Probably all those books,

2096
01:58:22.491 --> 01:58:26.960
but I don't know,
man.
I,
I definitely sold out a lot when I did fear factor.

2097
01:58:26.990 --> 01:58:28.250
I did a lot of selling out.

2098
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:31.130
But you weren't doing something that I didn't want to do for money.

2099
01:58:31.131 --> 01:58:34.100
So that is essentially you're selling your time,
but here's the problem.

2100
01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:36.650
Here's the difference there.
You were doing something,
which I assume,

2101
01:58:36.651 --> 01:58:37.371
correct me if I'm wrong,

2102
01:58:37.371 --> 01:58:41.990
but I assume you thought what you were doing was funny and I that it was,
no,
no,

2103
01:58:41.991 --> 01:58:45.270
no,
no.
Not fear factor.
Oh,
last time.
What News?
Radio.
Oh,
fear of falling.
No,

2104
01:58:45.310 --> 01:58:48.080
nears written his radio.
I'm very proud of Fairfax job.

2105
01:58:48.190 --> 01:58:50.590
There's just a lot of money.
There was no way to pass on it.

2106
01:58:50.591 --> 01:58:52.590
But what it made sure that I never did.

2107
01:58:52.630 --> 01:58:54.760
You weren't caught doing corny jokes for that?
No.

2108
01:58:54.820 --> 01:58:57.760
They weren't making you seem corny.
Shit.
No,
they weren't making me do corny shit,

2109
01:58:57.761 --> 01:59:00.430
but I wouldn't,
I didn't change my standup.
Right.
My stand up,

2110
01:59:00.520 --> 01:59:03.250
I did exactly the same way I would've done it with her had a TV show or not.

2111
01:59:03.340 --> 01:59:04.510
Yeah,
that's true.
I mean,

2112
01:59:04.520 --> 01:59:08.150
when you have a show that's like a lot of kids watch that show and you got,

2113
01:59:08.740 --> 01:59:10.000
there was only a lot of,
yeah,

2114
01:59:10.001 --> 01:59:13.810
but you could've gotten a wider audience if you just started doing super safe or

2115
01:59:13.811 --> 01:59:16.810
shit then because you were on NBC show,

2116
01:59:16.811 --> 01:59:19.330
I bet you could attract all those people that come see you in the theater when

2117
01:59:19.331 --> 01:59:22.720
you weren't doing theaters.
Um,
what do you like your mortgage to you?

2118
01:59:22.721 --> 01:59:25.390
Where I would have changed my act entirely.

2119
01:59:25.420 --> 01:59:28.330
I know a lot of this family comics who want to talk about dark shit,

2120
01:59:28.331 --> 01:59:31.420
but they're like,
I got this audience where I can't.
It's like,
yeah,
fucking death.

2121
01:59:31.421 --> 01:59:33.920
He a man as an artist,
that's the death of you as the death.

2122
01:59:34.030 --> 01:59:38.020
Knowing who your audience is,
the worst.
If you get fired,
it's a good story.
It's,

2123
01:59:38.021 --> 01:59:40.390
you know,
look,
you only did it in the first place to make money,

2124
01:59:40.630 --> 01:59:44.050
but just pretend you never got the job in the first place and he got a nice

2125
01:59:44.051 --> 01:59:45.600
little boost in your,
uh,

2126
01:59:45.670 --> 01:59:49.440
publicity because you get fired for doing what you love to do.
[inaudible]

2127
01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:54.460
it's show and it's fine.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I just feel like people change.
Dude,

2128
01:59:54.461 --> 01:59:54.860
this is what I,

2129
01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:58.060
that's what it is to people change and then they're not quite as like big time.

2130
01:59:58.390 --> 02:00:00.580
Well it's under the not,
not even quite as big time.

2131
02:00:00.581 --> 02:00:04.390
Like what they think is different than what they thought when they were 20 or 30

2132
02:00:04.391 --> 02:00:08.920
or 40 or 50 like,
like the Howard Stern.
He,
he just a different dude.

2133
02:00:08.940 --> 02:00:12.220
But I think that's part of lose,
losing relevancy.
Is that relevant?

2134
02:00:12.430 --> 02:00:16.580
I made how many old people you that he's not relevant to.
Maybe.

2135
02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:17.590
Maybe that's what it means.

2136
02:00:17.591 --> 02:00:21.640
Maybe being not being relevant means you're not relevant to a spending.

2137
02:00:21.641 --> 02:00:25.360
You know they have the demographic and the 18 to 35 year old boys is like big

2138
02:00:25.361 --> 02:00:28.360
cause I do the net spending because they're nuts.
Yeah.
They don't have wives,

2139
02:00:28.370 --> 02:00:28.670
but like,

2140
02:00:28.670 --> 02:00:32.920
so you're relevant to like a Matlock top crowd when it's like they don't see who

2141
02:00:32.921 --> 02:00:35.920
watched Matlock.
Yeah.
And murder.
She wrote,

2142
02:00:37.320 --> 02:00:40.330
you're using like references.
They were at a date when I was,

2143
02:00:41.010 --> 02:00:43.970
I was like a 15 that's what that was.
I don't have the,

2144
02:00:43.980 --> 02:00:46.360
I don't know what the new show shows for old people are and I know what it is.

2145
02:00:46.361 --> 02:00:48.370
It's America's got talent.
Oh,
how dare you.

2146
02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:51.070
So you're doing stuff for old people and they're not spenders.

2147
02:00:51.071 --> 02:00:52.060
Then I could go see movies.

2148
02:00:52.061 --> 02:00:55.000
Do you agree that he's like the most important radio guy of all time?

2149
02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:56.920
I would probably say that.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2150
02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:59.590
Other than the guy who had invented the radio.
Yeah.
Yeah.

2151
02:00:59.720 --> 02:01:03.580
This is the most important.
Yeah,
for sure.
He changed the way everybody talks.

2152
02:01:03.610 --> 02:01:06.070
I don't want to take away his legacy.
I want to stop talking about him.

2153
02:01:06.130 --> 02:01:09.490
How dare you.
That's what it is.
I want to talk about it in the past at,

2154
02:01:09.560 --> 02:01:12.010
I mean not right now.
I mean as like he was one of the best,

2155
02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:16.570
if he had died 15 years ago you,
there'll be nothing new bad coming in.

2156
02:01:16.780 --> 02:01:18.850
Wow.
So you wouldn't have to like disparage him.

2157
02:01:18.880 --> 02:01:21.370
So he's just in that same thing with Dan with all these people that have had

2158
02:01:21.371 --> 02:01:24.700
their peak and now they're on the downturn and they like don't don't shit on me.

2159
02:01:24.701 --> 02:01:25.511
But it's like we're not shitting on,

2160
02:01:25.511 --> 02:01:28.780
you were just really revering where you were at your height.
It was amazing.

2161
02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:30.700
A baseball player is not quite as good.

2162
02:01:31.100 --> 02:01:34.870
It doesn't mean he wasn't the best for four years in a row,
you know,

2163
02:01:34.900 --> 02:01:38.110
seven years ago and now you're just contributing players,

2164
02:01:38.111 --> 02:01:39.950
not like fuck you contributing player.
It's like

2165
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:41.870
<v 1>you are amazing for awhile.
That's awesome.</v>

2166
02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:45.620
That's going to happen no matter what though.
Especially with athletes.

2167
02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:47.440
Young athletes is the real big one.
I mean,

2168
02:01:47.441 --> 02:01:50.250
it's just like it's going to happen and they used the greatest of all time ever

2169
02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:53.270
reveres you and then you get caught taking steroids at two different occasions

2170
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.910
during a training camp.
I can tell you all about that.
You're going to,

2171
02:01:55.940 --> 02:01:57.710
I'll tell you a story when we get off air.
Okay.

2172
02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:01.400
I tell you on air that's you're going to go,
oh,
all right.

2173
02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:07.840
Um,
all right.
Could be more to the story.
I can't,
I'm not under a,
okay,

2174
02:02:07.841 --> 02:02:10.880
but let me ask you a question and you don't have to answer this at all,
but why,

2175
02:02:10.970 --> 02:02:12.020
who I love Jon Jones,

2176
02:02:12.021 --> 02:02:15.290
but why does he not get suspended for coke and Nick Diaz get suspended every

2177
02:02:15.291 --> 02:02:20.200
time for weed in a legal state.
I can try to eliminate for that.
Um,

2178
02:02:20.480 --> 02:02:24.930
there is out of contest testing and then there's in contest test.

2179
02:02:25.020 --> 02:02:27.560
So if you're calling your lawyer,
yes.
If you,

2180
02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:31.340
if he was under the influence of cocaine,
by the way,
I think.
Okay.

2181
02:02:31.370 --> 02:02:34.340
Should be totally not something that UFC should worry about it either.
Yeah,

2182
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:36.890
I think that's like a law thing that they should not test for.

2183
02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:38.990
Well maybe bugs and help your performance.

2184
02:02:38.991 --> 02:02:42.710
Somebody cocaine and they're in a fight and they're getting their ass kicked or

2185
02:02:42.711 --> 02:02:45.380
there it's a really brutal fight and they're worn out.

2186
02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.000
You gave them cocaine like they,

2187
02:02:47.080 --> 02:02:52.080
they believe happened with Aaron prior when he fought Alexis Aguayo the getting

2188
02:02:52.250 --> 02:02:56.300
coke in the middle of a fight.
This is what the thought.
That's different then.

2189
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:57.163
But go ahead.

2190
02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:02.000
Alexis Arguayo and Aaron Pryor had this fucking amazing fight.

2191
02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:06.170
Aaron Pryor went on to become,
I mean he was a world champion at the time,

2192
02:03:06.171 --> 02:03:10.280
but he went on to become a,
I'm a junkie.
He,
uh,
was a coke head.
He had a real,

2193
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:13.730
real big,
big problem.
Coke and just his life fell apart.

2194
02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:17.180
But when he was on,
he was an amazing fighter.
This guy,

2195
02:03:17.181 --> 02:03:20.510
Panama Lewis is in his corner and he asked for the bottle,
but you know,
he goes,

2196
02:03:20.520 --> 02:03:24.260
not that one.
The other one that I mixed,
Oh really?
Give him this bottle.

2197
02:03:24.261 --> 02:03:25.280
I think it was a black bottle.

2198
02:03:25.281 --> 02:03:28.670
He drinks from this bottle and he comes out and fucking destroys our quail,

2199
02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:31.490
puts them away in the next round.
And the question was,

2200
02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:36.680
was there any illegal substance in that bottle or was it just total coincidence

2201
02:03:37.580 --> 02:03:40.160
that Aaron Pryor came out and destroyed him?

2202
02:03:40.220 --> 02:03:42.260
And s when is a bottle that he mixed?
I mean,
who knows?

2203
02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:44.450
He could have been coconut water.
We don't know if it didn't destroy them.

2204
02:03:44.451 --> 02:03:45.830
No one would have thought twice about the second bottle.

2205
02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:50.570
But here's the problem that seemed guy was involved in a fight where these two

2206
02:03:50.571 --> 02:03:54.080
guys,
one of them,
I believe his name was Billy resto and another one was,

2207
02:03:54.470 --> 02:03:56.660
I forgot his name.
Um,

2208
02:03:56.661 --> 02:04:00.710
but he was a young Irish kid and he was a really good fighter and he was an up

2209
02:04:00.711 --> 02:04:04.100
and coming prospect and he fought this Guy Louie Resto.
Yeah,

2210
02:04:04.101 --> 02:04:06.770
Louie Resto and Billy Collins Jr I think it was.
Yeah.

2211
02:04:06.830 --> 02:04:10.100
My memory is like a fucking steel traps.
Um,

2212
02:04:10.160 --> 02:04:13.220
and Louie Resto just fuck this kid up.

2213
02:04:13.221 --> 02:04:16.190
He was a guy that was supposed to be like a,

2214
02:04:16.191 --> 02:04:18.530
a journeyman guy who was fucked up.

2215
02:04:18.740 --> 02:04:21.820
He fucked him up and he was hurting him with every punchy through.
And,
uh,

2216
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:23.480
he was telling his corner,
you know,
like,

2217
02:04:23.550 --> 02:04:25.640
this guy is hurting me with every punch he throws when they were like,

2218
02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:27.650
this guy's not a big puncher,
like this kind of crazy.

2219
02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:33.160
After the fight that father goes up to this resto guy and grabs his glove and

2220
02:04:33.411 --> 02:04:35.390
there's no padding and his gloves,
uh,

2221
02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:39.580
they'd pulled the padding out of the gloves,
the same trainer,
Panama Lewis,

2222
02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:43.320
the guy,
and he was banned for history,
for life from boxing.

2223
02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:47.310
He wound up working with Mike Tyson later on in his career.

2224
02:04:47.670 --> 02:04:51.210
And when he worked with Mike Tyson,
like he couldn't do the corner.
Like I don't,

2225
02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.790
he wasn't allowed.
No,
he wasn't allowed.
Wow.
So I don't know how,
like,

2226
02:04:53.791 --> 02:04:56.070
how much work he did with them or I might not have been any,

2227
02:04:56.071 --> 02:04:58.440
might've been trying to get relevant again.
But,
uh,

2228
02:04:58.441 --> 02:05:03.441
so it kind of lends a least a little bit of suspicion to the Aaron prior

2229
02:05:04.501 --> 02:05:07.320
incident and the fact that prior became a cocaine addict.

2230
02:05:07.321 --> 02:05:10.350
But it's always been a subject of extreme contrast.
Maybe that yeah,

2231
02:05:10.351 --> 02:05:12.900
they shouldn't have it in competition cause I can see that helping you actually.

2232
02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:13.170
Yeah.

2233
02:05:13.170 --> 02:05:16.380
If you've got a guy who does a lot of coke gotta pay you gotta Pay Jesus Christ,

2234
02:05:16.381 --> 02:05:18.240
you're okay.
He panicked.
Panicked.

2235
02:05:18.450 --> 02:05:20.700
You would think a man with a billboard would be a little more cool.

2236
02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:23.940
Motherfuckers gotta build bar.
Um,

2237
02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:27.420
we should probably find that clip for the folks while they listen in here.

2238
02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:30.240
Find a clip of a,
um,
Aaron Pryor,

2239
02:05:30.660 --> 02:05:33.690
the secret bottle with Panama Louis Cause there's a,
um,

2240
02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:36.750
there's like a video of it.
If you're a boxing historian,

2241
02:05:36.751 --> 02:05:40.320
you might already know about this because it's probably one of the most

2242
02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:44.070
important like,
uh,
controversies in the history.

2243
02:05:44.310 --> 02:05:48.630
Another one is when Ali,
when Muhammad Ali was young,
uh,

2244
02:05:48.631 --> 02:05:50.970
he fought Henry Cooper,

2245
02:05:51.000 --> 02:05:53.910
who is this British gentleman who was an excellent fighter as well.

2246
02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:58.680
And Henry Cooper hit Ali with a fucking left hook that was on the button,

2247
02:05:58.950 --> 02:06:02.280
sat him on his ass and really had him fucked up.

2248
02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:05.730
I mean he was really hurt and in their corner,

2249
02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:11.060
Angelo Dundee cut Ali's gloves so that cut his gloves.

2250
02:06:11.940 --> 02:06:14.400
So they had to change his gloves.
Like his gloves are cut.

2251
02:06:14.401 --> 02:06:15.300
We've got to change the gloves.

2252
02:06:15.330 --> 02:06:19.740
He got cut his fucking glove in a corner because Henry Cooper blasted Ali into

2253
02:06:19.741 --> 02:06:23.070
fucking Lalala.
Got An extra time.
Yeah.
Pull that.

2254
02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:28.050
That's actually more interesting.
Watch Henry Cooper Kaos Muhammad Ali put,

2255
02:06:28.051 --> 02:06:30.480
pull this video up cause it is pretty interesting.
Another,

2256
02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:34.170
this is going to be with the breath and of this weekend in Sacramento at the end

2257
02:06:34.170 --> 02:06:38.720
of the month,
could have heard the [inaudible] dot com for tickets.
Do I applied?

2258
02:06:39.900 --> 02:06:43.720
Um,
I,
this is when Ali was Cassius Clay's before he became really Holly.
Yeah.

2259
02:06:43.790 --> 02:06:48.480
Cut It to,
to save time to help.
Like oh yeah,
yeah.
He,
well he got hit by this guy,

2260
02:06:48.481 --> 02:06:51.030
Henry Cooper was famous for his left hook cracks.

2261
02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:54.990
Ali went and Benny when he was Cassius clay on the button drop some.

2262
02:06:55.230 --> 02:06:58.740
And then Mohammed Ali,
he sits down in between rounds here go,
we could play it.

2263
02:06:58.800 --> 02:06:59.633
You hear it?

2264
02:07:01.350 --> 02:07:06.050
<v 3>Watch this.
Oh,
Jesus knocked him through the ropes to,</v>

2265
02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:15.430
it's right at the bell.
So he got up like it's literally at the Buzzer.

2266
02:07:15.640 --> 02:07:16.473
<v 6>Hi Ben.</v>

2267
02:07:20.700 --> 02:07:23.890
<v 3>See what they're not play in now this is [inaudible].</v>

2268
02:07:24.330 --> 02:07:26.050
They didn't show the controversy mercy

2269
02:07:26.250 --> 02:07:29.610
<v 1>because it did to that.
Yeah,
I didn't,
they didn't go right to the next round.</v>

2270
02:07:29.611 --> 02:07:33.060
Like they're,
they edited out all that Shit.
This is,
this is trying to,

2271
02:07:33.061 --> 02:07:37.570
I don't know if somebody did this to try to protect legacy or if they wanted to,

2272
02:07:37.600 --> 02:07:40.150
uh,
just sitting,
you know,
there were a Mohammad Ali fans,

2273
02:07:40.151 --> 02:07:43.180
they want to highlight the good stuff.
But in between rounds,

2274
02:07:43.181 --> 02:07:46.180
after Henry Cooper dropped him his corner,

2275
02:07:46.570 --> 02:07:50.610
bottom time they cut the gloves.
Angelo Dundee,
I just took the,

2276
02:07:50.680 --> 02:07:53.020
took a razor and cotton so that,
okay,
we can't fight it.

2277
02:07:53.050 --> 02:07:54.010
You got to change the gloves.

2278
02:07:54.490 --> 02:07:58.150
And I think he might've even had to run to the back that change the gloves.

2279
02:07:59.230 --> 02:08:00.250
Let me see if it's a,

2280
02:08:01.870 --> 02:08:06.870
but that was like probably the most famous of all the controversies next to the,

2281
02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:10.270
nobody beat him at the next round.
Yeah,
well he cut him

2282
02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:14.820
and uh,
when he caught them,
um,
the,

2283
02:08:14.821 --> 02:08:17.970
they wound up stopping the fight because Ali was just boxing them up with the

2284
02:08:18.030 --> 02:08:22.800
punches.
Right.
I don't know.

2285
02:08:23.150 --> 02:08:26.020
I think he eventually cut him,
but it was the punch that dropped him,

2286
02:08:26.021 --> 02:08:29.190
which was the crazy thing.
So that's why they would,
they would,

2287
02:08:29.230 --> 02:08:34.120
they would ban because Nick Diaz was on weed.
Well,
there's fighting,

2288
02:08:34.180 --> 02:08:34.481
yeah.

2289
02:08:34.481 --> 02:08:38.070
The difference between fighting when you're on weed and by the way they changed

2290
02:08:38.071 --> 02:08:40.420
the,
the amount that you could have.

2291
02:08:40.780 --> 02:08:43.510
Like it used to be much lower threshold.

2292
02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:47.470
Like you'd have trace elements of marijuana and they would say you tested

2293
02:08:47.471 --> 02:08:48.400
positive for marijuana,

2294
02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:53.350
but they raised the threshold and Nick Diaz was still three times over the
limit.

2295
02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:55.780
It's not like he's a guy,
he's even saying,
I don't take it.

2296
02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:58.930
He's fully admitting all the time,
like,
can I smoke weed all the time?

2297
02:08:59.260 --> 02:09:02.650
Let's see if they play it here.
This is in between rounds.

2298
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:09.000
Let's see.
Gloves,
controversy

2299
02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:15.850
<v 6>still happening.
Yeah.</v>

2300
02:09:16.040 --> 02:09:20.590
<v 1>Oh look at that punch.
I mean he literally sat him down on his ass.</v>

2301
02:09:22.660 --> 02:09:23.493
<v 6>Hi.</v>

2302
02:09:26.730 --> 02:09:28.440
<v 1>So they're putting smelling salts on them.</v>

2303
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:29.803
<v 6>No Way.</v>

2304
02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:33.710
<v 1>He doesn't know where he is.
He couldn't fight like that.</v>

2305
02:09:33.900 --> 02:09:35.980
<v 6>Oh my God.
Listen</v>

2306
02:09:37.730 --> 02:09:42.730
[inaudible]

2307
02:09:59.050 --> 02:10:00.240
hi.
But not around five.

2308
02:10:01.550 --> 02:10:02.990
<v 1>So they bought him all that time.</v>

2309
02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:08.450
So instead of it being a minute in between rounds,
man,

2310
02:10:08.451 --> 02:10:11.240
I don't know how long it was like he was going on at the time.

2311
02:10:11.241 --> 02:10:14.400
People to us and something.
I probably took some some out of that.
Yeah.

2312
02:10:14.401 --> 02:10:17.130
It looked like they'd probably edit it a little bit.
Something out of that.

2313
02:10:17.131 --> 02:10:21.660
I wonder how long it took.
Interesting.
Yeah,
it is interesting man.
I mean that's,

2314
02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:24.990
we think of,
especially boxing lore.
Yeah.

2315
02:10:24.991 --> 02:10:26.610
You don't want to think that he got knocked down.

2316
02:10:26.640 --> 02:10:31.290
He had to get to the top by being the best ever.
He had a,
when all the fights,

2317
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:34.010
he had to be undefeated.
That's what everybody they wanted.

2318
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:36.080
<v 0>That guy's never been touched.
Yeah,
we don't,</v>

2319
02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:40.100
you don't want a guy that has a knockout loss.
To me.

2320
02:10:40.101 --> 02:10:41.870
It's so much more interesting when the champions,

2321
02:10:41.871 --> 02:10:44.750
when they go back and forth like it seemed like the raging bull days and stuff

2322
02:10:44.751 --> 02:10:48.440
where it's like,
yeah,
you have three,
four,
five losses,
so did somebody else,

2323
02:10:48.441 --> 02:10:50.660
but you guys are the best two in the world.
You know,

2324
02:10:50.661 --> 02:10:54.230
you revenged all your losses.
Avenged I don't know.

2325
02:10:54.231 --> 02:10:57.500
Something like that where you can be touched.
Yeah.

2326
02:10:58.190 --> 02:11:02.740
Di Angelo Dundee smelling salts under Clay's knows that's not electric,

2327
02:11:02.800 --> 02:11:07.520
which was illegal.
Oh yeah.
Oh,
a spare set of gloves,

2328
02:11:07.521 --> 02:11:09.260
so they did definitely change his gloves.

2329
02:11:09.380 --> 02:11:12.160
There was three to five minutes that probably took some out of that.
Yeah.

2330
02:11:12.320 --> 02:11:15.800
They took it out of it delaying the start of the fifth round.
Cooper as always,

2331
02:11:15.801 --> 02:11:19.640
insisted that delay lasted anywhere from three to five minutes and denied him

2332
02:11:19.641 --> 02:11:23.120
the chance to try to knock out clay if he didn't even know what time it was.

2333
02:11:23.150 --> 02:11:25.820
That's when they showed the highlight the replay in that,
in that clip.

2334
02:11:25.970 --> 02:11:29.090
If he didn't know what,
wait where he was,
he would've been gone that next round.

2335
02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:30.650
Yeah.
As soon as it started,
it would have been out.

2336
02:11:30.890 --> 02:11:34.610
Maybe one haymaker try and that's it.
It's interesting,
man is interesting.

2337
02:11:35.060 --> 02:11:36.540
It's crazy that that,
you know,

2338
02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:38.840
that changed the course of history and for the other guy too,

2339
02:11:38.841 --> 02:11:41.360
for that British guy fall.
Fuck yeah.
Fuck.
He's like,

2340
02:11:41.361 --> 02:11:45.380
I could've beaten Ali and I did,
but no one ever knows it.
Yeah.

2341
02:11:45.470 --> 02:11:48.680
I mean basically he was like one punch away from Keio victory.
Yeah.

2342
02:11:48.890 --> 02:11:51.410
But who knows if he would've landed that punch at the beginning of the round,

2343
02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:52.490
legit.
I mean,
who knows?

2344
02:11:52.580 --> 02:11:54.710
Ali wouldn't have been able to talk to them about three to five minutes.

2345
02:11:54.930 --> 02:11:57.020
He didn't know where it was,
didn't know where he was.

2346
02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.020
And they use smelling salts about to bring them out.
You get one minute,
right?

2347
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:03.470
Yeah.
They were about to bring him out.
Come on.
Deaf.
He was gone.

2348
02:12:03.950 --> 02:12:05.750
It's definitely illegal.
You can't do that shit

2349
02:12:08.870 --> 02:12:13.130
dude.
I was at your place once your old place and uh,
we were watching some,

2350
02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:16.520
some pride and then uh,
it ended early.

2351
02:12:16.521 --> 02:12:20.940
The recording ended or the DVR fucked it up.
Right.
Dvrs do fuck stuff up so well,

2352
02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:23.710
especially if you don't tell them to like record a,

2353
02:12:24.090 --> 02:12:27.740
it didn't used to be an option instead of the record,
the next show.

2354
02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:31.670
Oh to get it all.
Okay.
But um,

2355
02:12:31.850 --> 02:12:34.910
so we've got some pride event and it didn't finish the championship fight.

2356
02:12:35.180 --> 02:12:39.590
It didn't record that everything else went longer.
You know,
it's like fuck,

2357
02:12:39.591 --> 02:12:42.380
we're all disappointed.
I remember I forgot who the fight was,
but they're like,

2358
02:12:42.410 --> 02:12:46.040
oh well this does some heavyweight title fight in a for one belt or something.

2359
02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:47.270
We can watch that and have that recorded.

2360
02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:50.660
We watched that and after watching a bunch of mixed martial arts,

2361
02:12:51.320 --> 02:12:54.770
it was so boring and it was a decent fight.

2362
02:12:55.360 --> 02:13:00.350
But it was so boring.
Yeah.
There can be a lot of board and watching fights,

2363
02:13:00.351 --> 02:13:02.230
man hands.

2364
02:13:02.530 --> 02:13:05.360
Well if a guy's not a destroyer like Tyson was in that video,

2365
02:13:05.690 --> 02:13:08.300
you watched Tyson in that video.
That was exciting.
All those guys,

2366
02:13:08.301 --> 02:13:09.410
he was just a different dude.

2367
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:13.910
But there was too like NBC way to go cause they fucking Paul put the

2368
02:13:14.110 --> 02:13:18.260
heavyweights [inaudible] well Mayweather and Pacquiao will be exciting just

2369
02:13:18.261 --> 02:13:22.720
because of the sheer magnitude of the historical event.
Immune.

2370
02:13:22.760 --> 02:13:25.370
That's a giant historical event.
Those two guys getting down.

2371
02:13:25.371 --> 02:13:28.280
Finally it'll be something that you watch just for that.

2372
02:13:28.580 --> 02:13:32.250
But when it all said and done like you gonna to watch again,
watch it a second

2373
02:13:32.250 --> 02:13:32.961
<v 1>time.
You know,</v>

2374
02:13:32.961 --> 02:13:35.820
I've watched a lot of MMA fights a second time and it's very interesting.

2375
02:13:36.090 --> 02:13:38.010
It's only a few boxing fights it,
I'll do that with,

2376
02:13:38.150 --> 02:13:41.940
but this weekend they made a big play on NBC.
They had NBC live fights.

2377
02:13:42.180 --> 02:13:44.730
They're having live fights.
What?
Boxing?
Yeah,

2378
02:13:44.731 --> 02:13:48.470
they're having live worldclass boxing.
Oh that's cool.
Yeah.
So they had um,

2379
02:13:48.510 --> 02:13:50.940
they used to have that.
I remember he used to watch it was just like,

2380
02:13:51.420 --> 02:13:54.750
so they're doing it a time or something.
Well I think the NBC is recognized.

2381
02:13:54.751 --> 02:13:56.880
I mean,
did they have the contender,
was that NBC,

2382
02:13:57.690 --> 02:14:01.350
the boxing story about possibly maybe ABC,
I don't know.
Oxygen Network.
Anyway,

2383
02:14:03.360 --> 02:14:07.620
they have now.
I think they see the UFC does really good numbers on Fox and like,

2384
02:14:07.621 --> 02:14:10.260
Hey,
you know,
there's some big name fights out there to be made.

2385
02:14:10.261 --> 02:14:12.720
So they put together uh,
some,
you know,

2386
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:16.140
Pretty d Adrian Broner versus John Molina went to a decision,

2387
02:14:16.141 --> 02:14:19.790
boring fight and then they put um,
this guy,
um,

2388
02:14:19.860 --> 02:14:24.090
Keith Thurman who's this knockout artist versus Robert Guerra that went to

2389
02:14:24.091 --> 02:14:27.490
decision,
good fight but still went to a decision and nice.

2390
02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:30.090
But the Adrian Broner fibers,
like he was just kind of poking at him,

2391
02:14:30.180 --> 02:14:32.550
poking out on poke out.
I'm like,
it didn't,
never really,

2392
02:14:32.730 --> 02:14:36.270
never really had any danger.
He's just like,
just played it safe,

2393
02:14:36.390 --> 02:14:41.220
played it safe and pit lame.
Yeah.
It wasn't fun to watch.
It wasn't too,

2394
02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:46.200
but there's an art to,
it certainly is a method to his martial art,
you know,

2395
02:14:46.201 --> 02:14:48.940
watching him using his boxing.
But you know,

2396
02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:52.050
I want to watch a guy like pack out of that coast fucks people up.

2397
02:14:52.080 --> 02:14:54.150
That's what I like.
One of the things you like washed about Pacquiao,

2398
02:14:54.151 --> 02:14:56.000
he puts combinations on mother fuckers.

2399
02:14:57.140 --> 02:14:58.610
<v 0>Yeah.
I'm going to Thailand.</v>

2400
02:14:58.611 --> 02:15:02.450
I want to go watch a fucking kickboxing fight in Thailand.
You gotta make videos.

2401
02:15:02.470 --> 02:15:07.010
You Bet.
Bet.
Bet at all they got that guy,
that guy.

2402
02:15:07.550 --> 02:15:11.660
Yeah.
Here.
Knock.
So cow.
Did I win or lose?
I don't know what I bet on.

2403
02:15:12.380 --> 02:15:13.610
Yeah.
Just bring some uh,

2404
02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:18.680
Thai lady boys with you to decipher everything before you hire them.
Yeah.

2405
02:15:18.681 --> 02:15:21.890
And film it with Vice Vice.
Go there.
A lady boy,
uh,
yeah,

2406
02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:26.900
chaperone you in a three piece suit because you have money now and decide to go

2407
02:15:27.831 --> 02:15:29.930
to Thailand and live up your dreams,

2408
02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:34.130
which is to go to see an MMA fighter or a Moy Thai fight with some Thai lady

2409
02:15:34.131 --> 02:15:38.970
boys.
Yeah.
And they teach you how to make a video of that.
Yeah.

2410
02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:44.240
And with that note,
ladies and gentleman this week,
uh,
this is not happening.

2411
02:15:44.270 --> 02:15:48.490
It's 12:30 AM on Thursday evenings.
Um,

2412
02:15:48.560 --> 02:15:53.300
you are special.
Midnight.
My special home is available right now.
Yeah.
It's also,

2413
02:15:53.350 --> 02:15:55.010
it's available for presale right now are the great,

2414
02:15:55.011 --> 02:15:57.850
but this special is the one I did.
This is the first special after I did my,

2415
02:15:57.980 --> 02:16:01.790
my CD where I was like,
let me try to write a new hour starting now,

2416
02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.350
let me see if I can do this in a year.

2417
02:16:03.351 --> 02:16:05.930
Really concentrate and that's when my first year on the road.

2418
02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:09.920
So I was able to really like get a lot more time and that's why I did the

2419
02:16:09.921 --> 02:16:13.610
knitting factory and uh,
it was like limited release where nobody saw it.

2420
02:16:13.611 --> 02:16:16.460
So I'm doing it for however much you want to pay.
If you already paid for it,

2421
02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:20.450
it's a minimum of a dollar than pay a dollar if you can't find anymore.

2422
02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:22.900
And if you really love them,
give me 50 bucks,
whatever the fuck you want.

2423
02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.820
They'll like,
I don't know about this.
I was like,
let's just try it as a method.

2424
02:16:25.821 --> 02:16:29.800
Let's try it and see if people pay or not.
They'll pay.
Yeah.
It's stuff man.

2425
02:16:29.801 --> 02:16:30.100
And it's

2426
02:16:30.100 --> 02:16:32.530
<v 1>a,
it's for you as a,
as a comic,
it's like,</v>

2427
02:16:32.531 --> 02:16:35.980
it represents like what you really just sort of launched yourself,

2428
02:16:36.330 --> 02:16:39.160
you really sort of with,
with hard work and focus,

2429
02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:41.740
you just became a much better comic.

2430
