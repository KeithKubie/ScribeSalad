00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.080
Maria Ann Sherwood was born into a farming
family in England in 1799.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.490
Because of her parents’ work, she became
interested in agriculture and began working

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.980
on the farm as well.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.380
When she was just nineteen years old she married
a man named Thomas Smith, who was also a farm

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.310
labourer, and the pair managed a farm in Beckley
for the next nineteen years, beginning a family

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.310
of their own.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.970
In 1838, government officials were recruiting
people from agricultural backgrounds who possessed

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.720
the skills desperately needed for farms in
Australia.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.680
Along with several other families from the
area, the Smiths boarded the Lady Nugent and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.489
arrived in Sydney on November 27, 1838.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.809
Upon their arrival, Thomas was given a job
by Mr. Smart of Kissing Point, later to become

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.510
Ryde, and earned £5 per year as a farm labourer.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.620
Like most people in the area, the Smiths honed
their skills as orchardists.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.559
Fruit abounded in the district.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:57.739
Between 1855 and 1856, the Smiths bought their
own lot of land and began their own orchard.

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.810
Maria Ann Smith enjoyed raising her own seedling
apples, just as many of her neighbours specialized

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.260
in other varieties of fruits.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.700
There are several different accounts about
her discovery of her namesake apple, but the

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.990
most likely one comes from an article in Farmer
and Settler from 1924.

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.210
Herbert Rumsey, who published the article,
was also an orchardist in the area and interviewed

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.430
two other farmers who knew Granny Smith.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.439
They said that in 1868, Maria Ann Smith, then
69 years old, found the seedling growing by

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.649
a creek on her property.

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.490
She believed that the seedling had grown from
French crab apples (it is now believed that

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:34.490
the apple is a cross between the Malus sylvestris,
or European Wild Apple, and the M. domestica,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.490
or domestic apple).

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.829
Granny Smith began to cultivate this new apple
tree.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.320
Yet another local, Edward Gallard, developed
a large crop of them from cuttings from the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.360
first tree and continued to do so annually
until his death in 1914.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.329
The apples became widely popular in Australia
and New Zealand.

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.180
Displayed at the Castle Hill Agricultural
and Horticultural Show in 1891, “Smith’s

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.950
seedling” won the prize for best cooking-apple.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.369
In 1895, Granny Smith Apples were being produced
at the Government Experimental Station in

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.030
Bathurst, New South Wales on a large scale.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.991
Soon after, they were included on the list
of fruits suitable for export put out by the

00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:08.360
Department of Agriculture.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.490
The apples were introduced to Great Britain
in 1935.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:14.840
This particular apple is a relatively recent
addition to the United States, where it was

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.290
introduced in 1972 by Grady Auvil of the Auvil
Fruit Company.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.920
Unfortunately, Granny Smith herself never
saw her apples gain commercial recognition.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:43.750
She died in 1870, just two years after discovering
the apple seedling on her property.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:03:07.290
The apples were sustained and 
propagated by local orchardists until they

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:29.450
became well-known, but it is Granny Smith
who will be remembered as the woman who discovered

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.460
one of the most well-known green apples.
