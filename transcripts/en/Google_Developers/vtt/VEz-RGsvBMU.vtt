ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Hi.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.550
Welcome back to DEVOXX 2013.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:14.989
I'm here with Dan to
talk about a service

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:16.780
that Google is offering
to game developers.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.074
So welcome, Dan.

00:00:18.074 --> 00:00:18.990
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.800
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Tell
us what this is really about

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.332
and who we're
targeting with this.

00:00:22.332 --> 00:00:23.040
DAN GALPIN: Sure.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.840
Well, the service is
Google Play Game Services.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.010
Developers have been
asking us for a long time

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:37.199
how to help them find users and
how to help them engage users

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:39.740
and, more importantly, how to
give them some features they've

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.150
been desperately wanting.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.292
And so we put together
a service that

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:45.750
give users what they've been
wanting for a long time, which

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.950
is Cloud Save.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.220
We have achievements
and leaderboards,

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.510
which drive engagement.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.030
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090
DAN GALPIN: And what's really
exciting about this is we

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.620
haven't just done
this for Android,

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.470
but we've actually made this
a cross-platform solution.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.170
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Hence the name.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.830
It's not the Android service.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.847
It's the Google--

00:01:00.847 --> 00:01:01.680
DAN GALPIN: Exactly.

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.590
It's a Google service.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.548
And it's really important,
because we recognize

00:01:04.548 --> 00:01:06.860
that people want to
play games with not just

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.820
their friends who
own Android devices.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.560
But they want to be able to play
games with their iOS friends,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.890
friends with other
devices, and, of course,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.130
people who are using
the web and Chrome.

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.380
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.980
Great.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.070
So a lot of people can use this.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.006
People have been using
other solutions before.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.630
Here, we're offering
this as a service.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.005
Obviously, it's
a Google service.

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.550
You would expect this to
scale, this to be always up.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.660
And so how about sign in?

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.152
Is there any identity
integration offered with that?

00:01:36.152 --> 00:01:36.860
DAN GALPIN: Yeah.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.230
We do use Google+ identity.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.960
And that's really important,
because we wanted privacy

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.510
to be paramount from the
very start of this service.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.360
And Google+ gives us the ability
to give the users the kind

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.040
of privacy controls
they expect from Google.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.040
That's really important.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.550
There was a lot of resistance
to a lot of different sign ins

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:55.280
that we were seeing.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.960
And so we said, all right.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.543
What do we need to
do in order to make

00:01:57.543 --> 00:02:00.157
sure we get as many people
as comfortable with signing

00:02:00.157 --> 00:02:02.240
in and sharing their game
activity with the people

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.240
they want to share
it with as possible?

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.289
So it really was a no-brainer
for us to look at Google+

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.300
identity.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.675
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: So you

00:02:10.675 --> 00:02:13.410
are one of the people that
looks after developers

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.470
that build games.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.479
How has this been going so far?

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.770
DAN GALPIN: There's a huge
amount of excitement for it.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.100
Again, users have been really
wanting this for a long time.

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.766
And people have
actually been asking me,

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.270
whether it's been developers,
whether it's been gamers,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.270
they've been coming up
to me and saying, please,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.300
please do something
in this space.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.890
And I think what's exciting is
we didn't just do something,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.200
but we're really doing something
with a very broad reach.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.220
We could have done something
very, very simple, I think.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.440
And instead, we
chose to really go in

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.960
with a tremendous service.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.230
And what's exciting to me
is it's a Google service.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.020
And game developers were really,
really worried in the past.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.130
They would go, and
they would choose

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.796
a service that did
some of these things.

00:02:52.796 --> 00:02:55.730
The company would cancel
it, or as it would scale,

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.720
it would start costing
them a lot of money.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.840
And what's great is we're
providing this service

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.127
to game developers
for free across all

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:03.210
these different platforms.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.320
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
It's worth mentioning.

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.903
DAN GALPIN: And if
they're successful,

00:03:05.903 --> 00:03:09.020
they don't end up losing
out, because the service is

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.349
going to scale with them.

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.140
It's not going to start
costing them money.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.770
They can be comfortable that the
service is going to be around.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:15.895
And that's exciting for me.

00:03:15.895 --> 00:03:17.811
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
One of the features

00:03:17.811 --> 00:03:18.820
is multiplayer games.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.070
DAN GALPIN: Yes.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.070
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
How does that really work?

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.460
And is that realtime?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.880
What kind of gaming really
can I build with that?

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.620
DAN GALPIN: I can't
believe I didn't even

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.810
mention that at the beginning.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.130
Yeah.

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.610
One of the most
important features we do

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.901
is realtime multiplayer gaming.

00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:32.210
And that allows a developer
to create a mesh network

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.650
with currently up to
three of their friends,

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.360
so a four-player mesh network.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.670
And it's realtime gaming.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.980
It's great because it
chooses the fastest

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.810
route it can between
the four players.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.310
So if you're on a
local network, it

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.820
will actually choose a route
that will connect directly

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.480
between the players for really,
really high speed, low latency

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.150
gaming.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.965
And it'll also ping our servers
and do nat traversal for you

00:03:53.965 --> 00:03:56.197
if need to play a game
over the internet.

00:03:56.197 --> 00:03:57.530
So it's really, really powerful.

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.070
And again, what's
great is in order

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.590
to do this without
Google scale, you

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.179
would have to have
machines and data

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:04.720
centers all around
the world in order

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.520
to try to get low
latency connections.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.186
Google is just providing
this because we

00:04:08.186 --> 00:04:10.050
want to make the gaming
experience great.

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.870
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Awesome.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:15.110
I've built a game.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.810
I know how to build
games, say, on Android.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:19.514
Let's take that example.

00:04:19.514 --> 00:04:21.430
What does it take for
me to actually integrate

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.240
with that service?

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.180
And how hard is it to add
it to an existing game?

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.400
DAN GALPIN: That's one of
the things that's great.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.650
It all depends on which
platform you're on, of course.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.949
On Android, we've made it
part of Google Play Services.

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:33.990
So it's a part of things
that people have already

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.120
got on their device.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.380
We're constantly
pushing updates to that,

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.390
constantly making
the platform better.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.397
And all they have to do is
integrate a very, very simple

00:04:42.397 --> 00:04:43.730
library that we've put together.

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.796
We have tons of
sample code for them,

00:04:45.796 --> 00:04:47.920
including a bunch of great
little sample games that

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.480
illustrate all the
different features.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.200
We actually did a Code
Lab here at DEVOXX

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.460
where we had people
integrate Google Play

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.810
Services with a game.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.640
It took about 20
minutes for most of them

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.030
to get the basic
stuff all integrated.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.920
And it's exciting.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.630
It's exciting to see how
quickly people can move on it.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.980
On iOS, we also provide
a client library.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.800
And then for the web, it's
a series of REST APIs.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.410
And those can be used anywhere,
of course, which is exciting.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.380
It's not just focusing on
these two mobile platforms.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.390
But we wanted to make sure the
experience for Android and iOS

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.610
developers was great.

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:22.770
It also allows us to provide a
lot of features to those users.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.400
For Android and iOS
users, for example,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.050
we support offline achievements,
offline leaderboards,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.700
all of those kinds of offline
features that people expect.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.283
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
I was going

00:05:34.283 --> 00:05:35.660
to get to the
offline part of it.

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:36.600
I commute.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.070
I take the metro, and
connectivity's not always

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:41.060
there.

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.200
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.158
It is really important.

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:44.001
If someone gets an
achievement offline,

00:05:44.001 --> 00:05:45.750
they want to see it
pop up in the service.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.710
They want to see that
it's going to get back

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:49.330
to Google eventually.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:49.880
And so we do.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.140
If you get the
achievement offline,

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:53.765
on Android we'll go and sync it
in the background the next time

00:05:53.765 --> 00:05:54.852
we get connectivity.

00:05:54.852 --> 00:05:56.060
On iOS, we don't do that yet.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.620
But the next time you play the
game and you have connectivity,

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.920
it'll make sure
to sync things up.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.180
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:01.430
Great.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:05.580
What is the experience in terms
of the Google Play Developer

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:06.170
Console?

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.415
Do you get to see how people
use your game and the API?

00:06:09.415 --> 00:06:11.040
DAN GALPIN: You get
a couple of things.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:12.620
One is that you do get
some basic analytics

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.036
on how people are
using your game.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.200
Obviously, I always recommend
people put their own analytics

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.800
in as well.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.250
But as we roll this
out further, we're

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.202
going to have deeper and deeper
engagement numbers, which

00:06:23.202 --> 00:06:23.930
is exciting.

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.880
What's also cool
is we actually get

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.552
to see the engagement
numbers as well.

00:06:29.552 --> 00:06:30.760
And I think this is exciting.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.397
Because we don't track
people's usage on Android,

00:06:34.397 --> 00:06:36.230
so we don't know what
games they're playing.

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:37.450
But now they're signing in.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:39.670
They're saying,
yes, Google, we want

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.010
you know about what we're doing.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.790
And that gives us
a much better way

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.919
of actually directing people to
games that we know users love.

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:48.460
So it's not just a question of
have they downloaded the game,

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.030
but who's actually
playing, who's

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:51.690
actually engaging
with that content.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.410
It allows us to be much smarter
in terms of Google Play.

00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:58.059
And of course, we also have the
Google Play Games application.

00:06:58.059 --> 00:06:59.600
That's great because
you can actually

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.000
go to this application.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.609
We have, according to Google
Play, between 10 and 50

00:07:03.609 --> 00:07:05.025
million downloads
of this already.

00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.180
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: OK.

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:07.890
DAN GALPIN: You can go and see
what your friends are playing,

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:10.630
and you can also see how
your friends are progressing.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:13.691
So you can go leaderboards, and
that's huge for competition.

00:07:13.691 --> 00:07:15.690
There are several games
I've played because I've

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:16.990
seen that one of my
friends was playing it,

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.770
and then I realized
that I have to beat

00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:19.620
their scores on
the leaderboards.

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:20.195
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Right.

00:07:20.195 --> 00:07:22.361
DAN GALPIN: I'm naturally
somewhat game competitive,

00:07:22.361 --> 00:07:24.410
I guess.

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:27.370
I see it working
just within our team.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:30.587
And I know it's working
out in the world as well.

00:07:30.587 --> 00:07:31.920
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Cool.

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.490
So where should developers
go to learn about this?

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.750
DAN GALPIN: They should go to
developers.google.com/games.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.150
That'll take them to a page
talking all about the things

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.390
that we offer for
game developers.

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:44.870
And then if you go to
 developers.google.com/games/services,

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:47.200
that actually has all of the
things we're doing with Google

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:47.991
Play Game Services.

00:07:47.991 --> 00:07:49.500
But do go to the main Game site.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.320
There's a lot of stuff we're
doing for game developers

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:51.819
out there.

00:07:51.819 --> 00:07:54.490
I think that it's really
exciting to see Google getting

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.625
behind games the way we
have in the last year.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.000
ALEXIS
MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Great.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.270
Well, Dan, thanks.

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:02.153
This is all the
time we have for.

00:08:02.153 --> 00:08:05.590
Try it out and provide feedback.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.862
You guys are online available?

00:08:06.862 --> 00:08:07.820
DAN GALPIN: Absolutely.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.778
You can go, of course,
to the Android developer

00:08:09.778 --> 00:08:11.450
channel for the Android APIs.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:13.200
And of course, go to
developers.google.com

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.756
to learn more about
what we're doing

00:08:14.756 --> 00:08:16.630
and to see our announcements
involving games.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.230
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Stack Overflow is a good place?

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:18.530
DAN GALPIN: Stack
Overflow is a great place

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.696
to ask questions, as always.

00:08:19.696 --> 00:08:24.740
We have a team that goes and
monitors that as well as making

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:27.530
sure that we actually
integrate your feedback.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.117
You can also actually give us
feedback on our GitHub site.

00:08:30.117 --> 00:08:32.200
That's actually where we
post all the sample code.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:32.460
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE:
Oh, good.

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:33.950
DAN GALPIN: And you
can also post changes.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.129
If you have any ideas or bug
fixes that need to go there,

00:08:36.129 --> 00:08:38.299
that's a great place to
talk with the team as well.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:38.900
ALEXIS MOUSSINE-POUCHKINE: Cool.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:39.746
Game on.

00:08:39.746 --> 00:08:40.720
DAN GALPIN: Thank you.

00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:42.480
Game on.
