00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.020
What do you, as you’re watching me right
now, have in common with a toddler who’s
being read a bedtime story?

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.520
I’ll give you a clue.

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.630
It’s also something you have in common with
the kids in The Breakfast Club.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.780
As well as with a soldier going through boot
camp.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:12.780
Give up?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.210
You’re all being socialized.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.800
It’s also the title of the episode.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.830
You probably saw that.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.320
Each of us is surrounded by people, and those
people become a part of how we act and what
we value.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:28.840
This is known as socialization: the social process
through which we develop our personalities and human
potential and learn about our society and culture.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.380
Last time, we talked about the HOW of socialization,
how we learn about the social world.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.120
And no matter which of the many theories out there
that you like best, the answer seems to be that we’re
socialized by interacting with other people.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.500
But which people?

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.940
What we didn’t talk about last week was
the WHO of socialization:

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.000
Who do we learn about the social world from?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.420
What people, and what institutions, have made
you who you are today?

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:02.300
[Theme Music]

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.240
Socialization is a life-long process, and
it begins in our families.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.260
Mom, Dad, grandparents, siblings – whoever
you’re living with is pretty much your entire
social world when you’re very young.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.680
And that’s important, because your family is the
source of what’s known as primary socialization –

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.660
your first experiences with language, values,
beliefs, behaviors, and norms of your society.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.760
Parents and guardians are your first
teachers of everything –

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:29.600
from the small stuff like how to brush your teeth to
the big stuff like sex, religion, the law, and politics.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:37.240
The games they play with you, the books they read, the toys they buy for you, all provide you with what French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu called cultural capital –

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.360
the non-financial assets that help people
succeed in the world.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.100
Some of this cultural capital may seem fairly
innocuous – I mean, is reading Goodnight Moon
really making that big of an impact on a toddler?

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.340
Yes, actually.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.220
It teaches the “value” of reading as much
as it helps the child begin to recognize written
language.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.300
The presence of books in the home is associated
with children doing well in school.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.380
Another important form of socialization that
starts in the home is gender socialization,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.940
learning the psychological and social traits
associated with a person’s sex.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.280
Gender socialization starts from the moment
that parents decide on a gendered name and when
nurses put a pink or a blue hat on the baby.

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.440
Other group memberships, like race and class,
are important parts of initial socialization.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:19.340
Race socialization is the process through
which children learn the behaviors, values,
and attitudes associated with racial groups.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.020
Racial discrimination is partly the result
of what parents teach their children about
members of other races.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:30.140
And class socialization teaches the norms,
values, traits, and behaviors you develop
based on the social class you’re in.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.020
This may help explain why more middle- and
upper-class children go to college.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.460
Not only can the families afford to send them,
but these children are expected to attend.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.840
They grow up in a home that normalizes college
attendance.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.440
Now, gender, race, and class socialization
are all examples of anticipatory socialization

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.780
– that’s the social process where people
learn to take on the values and standards
of groups that they plan to join .

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.260
Small children anticipate becoming adults,
for example, and they learn to play the part
by watching their parents.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.900
Gender socialization teaches boys to “be
a man” and girls to “be a woman”.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.900
But children also learn through secondary
socialization –

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.040
that’s the process through which children
become socialized outside the home, within
society at large.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.700
This often starts with school.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.700
Schools are often kids’ first introduction
to things like bureaucracies,

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.960
as well as systems of rules that require them to be
in certain places at certain times, or act in ways that
may be different from what they learned at home.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.900
Not only do schools teach us the three r’s
– reading, ‘riting and ‘rithmetic –

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:30.420
but they come with what sociologists call a hidden
curriculum – that is, an education in norms, values,
and beliefs that are passed along through schooling.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.620
Take, for example, a spelling bee.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.480
Its main goal is to teach literacy and encourage
kids to learn how to spell.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.860
But something as seemingly benign as a spelling
bee can have many hidden lessons that stick
with kids, too.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.540
For example, it teaches them that doing better
than their peers is rewarding – and it enforces
the idea that the world has winners and losers.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.300
Another hidden curriculum of school in general
is to expose kids to a variety of people.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.300
When your only socialization is your family,
you just get one perspective on race, class,
religion, politics, et cetera.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.020
But once you go out into the world, you meet
many people from many backgrounds,

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.760
teaching you about race and ethnicity, social class,
disability, gender and sexuality, and more.

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.880
School becomes not just a classroom for
academic subjects, but also for learning
about different kinds of people.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.400
And, of course, schools are also where kids
are exposed to one of the most defining aspects
of school-age life: peer groups.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.500
Peer groups are social groups whose members
have interests, social position, and usually
age in common.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.440
As you get older, your peer group has a massive
impact on the socialization process.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.860
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble to to see
just how big that impact can be.

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.460
In the late 1950s, American sociologist James
Coleman began studying teenagers –

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.600
how they interacted and how their social
lives affected their education.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:46.120
He interviewed teens in 11 high schools in the Midwest, asking them questions about what social group they identified with and who else they considered members of their group.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.380
Based on these interviews, Coleman identified
four main social categories.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.460
And, uh, the names of these categories will
probably sound familiar to you:

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.420
They were nerds, jocks, leading crowd, and burnouts.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.380
Basically, he discovered the 1950s version
of The Breakfast Club.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.920
And with these social categories came social
prescriptions – behaviors that were expected
of people in those groups.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:11.100
Coleman found that certain things were important to
the members of certain groups, like being a good dancer
or smoking or having money or getting good grades.

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.260
He also tested the students’ IQs and assessed
their grades.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.340
And surprise!

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.419
It turned out that who you hung out with affected
how well you did in school.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:25.500
In some of the schools, getting good grades was considered an important criterion for the “leading group” – aka the popular kids– but in other schools, it wasn’t.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.440
And in the schools where good grades
were not a sign of popularity,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.140
students who scored high on IQ tests actually did
worse on their exams than similarly smart students
at schools where good grades made you popular.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.280
Thanks Thought Bubble!

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.520
Now, Coleman’s study might seem like common
sense – of course you and your friends are
gonna be pretty similar.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.120
Don’t we choose to be friends with people
who are like us?

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.720
Well, not entirely.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.480
Coleman’s study showed that we don’t just
pick peer groups that fit into our existing traits –

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.900
instead, peer groups help mold
what traits we end up with.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:58.840
OK, so far, we have family, schools, and peers
as the main forces that influence someone’s
socialization.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.280
But what about me?

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.940
Yes, me, Nicole Sweeney.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:04.380
Am I part of your socialization?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.139
Or more precisely, are youtube videos considered
a form of socialization?

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.480
Short answer: yes!

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.980
Long answer: The media you consume are
absolutely a part of your socialization.

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.720
TV and the internet are huge parts of Americans’
lives.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.979
And how we consume our media is affected by
social traits, like class, race, and age.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.360
A teenager or twenty-something in 2017 is
much more likely to watch online media, like
Netflix or youtube, than television.

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:31.180
And low-income Americans watch much more TV
than their higher-income counterparts.

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:33.740
The media we consume also impact us dramatically.

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.740
The American Academy of Pediatrics, for example,
has said there are connections between excessive

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:41.840
television viewing in early childhood and
cognitive, language and social emotional delays.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.680
But TV can also influence the attitudes of
viewers, especially young ones.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:53.180
For example, studies have found that kids exposed to Sesame Street in randomized-controlled trial settings, reported more positive attitudes toward people of different races –

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.240
most likely a result of the program’s wide variety of characters from different racial and ethnic backgrounds.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.720
TV also affects us well beyond childhood.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.980
One recent study found that MTV’s “16 and
Pregnant” may have acted as a cautionary tale,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:10.060
helping to change teen girls’ attitudes toward
birth control and contributing to declining rates
of teen pregnancy.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:15.980
So far, the types of socialization we’ve
talked about have been fairly subtle — but there are
also more intense types of socialization.

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.140
Total institutions are places where people
are completely cut off from the outside world,
and face strict rules for how they must behave.

00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:32.680
First coined by sociologist Erving Goffman, the term “total institution” refers to places like the military, prisons, boarding schools, or psychiatric institutions that control all aspects of their residents’ lives –

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.800
how they dress, how they speak,
where they eat, where they sleep.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:44.600
And in a total institution, residents undergo resocialization, where their environment is carefully controlled to encourage them to develop a new set of norms, values, or beliefs.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:50.780
They do this by, basically, breaking down
your existing identity and then using rewards
and punishment to build up a whole new you.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.020
Think about every boot camp movie you’ve
ever seen.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:08:00.740
All soldiers are given the same haircut and uniform, expected to reply to questions in the same way, put through the same grueling exercises, and humiliated by the same officer.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:09.000
This process re-socializes the soldiers to put extreme value on their identity within the group, making them more willing to value self-sacrifice if their unit is in danger.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.520
So whether you’re GI Jane training for a reconnaissance team or Molly Ringwald trying to maintain her queen-bee status in the leading crowd,

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.240
the you that you are has been powerfully
shaped by people and institutions.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.320
Now, think back on your own life – who has
been the biggest influence on YOUR socialization?

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.500
Who do you think that you yourself have influenced?

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:33.280
Hard questions to answer, maybe, but definitely
worthwhile – and hopefully a little easier now that
you’ve learned how sociologists think about it.

00:08:33.289 --> 00:08:35.779
Today, we learned about five different types
of socialization.

00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:40.960
We talked about anticipatory socialization
from your family, like gender norms, that
prepare children for entering society.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.019
We discussed the “hidden curriculum” in
schools.

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:46.780
We learned about peer groups through a look
at James Coleman’s study of teenage social
groups.

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:49.260
We explored the role of media in socialization.

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:54.330
And finally, we talked about total institutions
and how they can act as a form of re-socialization.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:09:01.000
