00:00:00.706 --> 00:00:02.206
Right now, somewhere out there,

00:00:02.231 --> 00:00:05.269
an educator is delivering
a mind-altering lesson to their class.

00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:08.269
I want to engage your brains in this.

00:00:08.294 --> 00:00:11.574
Chris Anderson: I tried to get
my head around how vast our Earth is.

00:00:11.598 --> 00:00:14.652
Logan Smalley: The lesson only reaches
the students in that room.

00:00:14.677 --> 00:00:16.478
What would happen if we captured it?

00:00:16.502 --> 00:00:17.640
It's a toothed wheel.

00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:20.150
LS: What if pro animators
and visualization artists

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.758
could bring that lesson to life?

00:00:21.783 --> 00:00:24.808
CA: It's a common object
that literally fits one million Earths.

00:00:24.832 --> 00:00:27.311
It's got a bunch of notches
and a bunch of teeth.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:28.792
This was Fizeau's solution --

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.100
LS: When that lesson lands,
curiosity is ignited.

00:00:31.116 --> 00:00:32.482
CA: It seems impossibly big.

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:34.136
AS: Something interesting happens.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.564
CA: In the great scheme
of things, it's a pinprick.

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:40.626
AS: A door closes on the light beam
that's coming back to his eye.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.209
LS: Then that group of students
is one thought closer

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.543
to being what every teacher
hopes their students will become:

00:00:46.568 --> 00:00:47.568
a lifelong learner.

00:00:47.593 --> 00:00:50.273
AS: Based on the distance
between the two stations --

00:00:50.297 --> 00:00:53.216
CA: The quest for knowledge
and understanding never gets dull.

00:00:53.241 --> 00:00:57.226
AS: He calculates the speed of light
to within two percent of its actual value.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.645
CA: The more you know,
the more amazing the world seems.

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:02.679
That's the central mission of TED-Ed:

00:01:02.703 --> 00:01:04.797
to capture and to amplify

00:01:04.822 --> 00:01:06.840
the voice of the world's
greatest teachers.

00:01:06.865 --> 00:01:09.658
He does this in 1849.

00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:12.720
CA: It's the crazy possibilities,
the unanswered questions,

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:14.145
that pull us forward.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.781
So stay curious.
