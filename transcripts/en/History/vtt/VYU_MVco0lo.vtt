00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.830
We have a situation in Fargo.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.500
A pilot of ours claims who
have gotten into a dogfight

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.040
with an alien craft.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.710
The plane has the battle
scars to prove it.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.830
[screaming]

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.170
I'll get down
there right away.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.880
I need you to meet
with someone first.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.040
Name's Dr. J. Allen Heinich.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.170
Teaches astrophysics
at Ohio State.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.540
You've done great work for us.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.420
I think it's time we
got you a partner.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.580
You want me to
investigate flying saucers?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.000
I want you to help me prove
to the public the truth.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.420
They don't exist.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.080
Could I ask your opinion?

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.080
Which shade do you
think works best?

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.500
Neither.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.080
It's just with your
hair color and features,

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.540
pinks won't works.

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.880
Something a bit bolder.
Susie.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.750
Mimi.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.170
Mimi.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.580
What do you know
about men's ties?

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.710
Gentlemen, I'm told
you boys are here

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.210
to make this all make sense.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540
Keeps mumbling this
song "How High The Moon."

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.880
Won't tell us why.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.080
This thing was moving fast.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.000
It moves sideways.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.460
The goddamn thing, it
was toying with me.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.120
MAN: The flight
maneuvers he described

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120
when that light was going at
him, best pilot on the planet

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.920
couldn't do it, sir.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.080
How do you explain the damage
to the underside of his plane?

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.210
What type of UFO could do that?
- I'm sorry.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.120
UF what?

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.460
Unidentified flying object.

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.960
This is a new science
we're creating here.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.290
It needs its own terminology.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.620
I think I can
actually identify what

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.790
it is for which [inaudible].

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.250
A weather balloon.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.290
Our flight record records
show there was one

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.790
in the area that night as well.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.250
Look at this.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.750
Solid metal.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.920
Fly too close and scrape
that, it'll leave a mark.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.460
Mimi, I'm new in town.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.790
Where are all the fun
spots in Columbus.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.540
And if you say the roller
rink, I'm going to squeal.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.170
I don't think I'm the
right person to ask.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.420
Alan and I used to rumba
down at the rec center,

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.460
but he works so much, you know.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.620
Just picked up another job.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:53.500
Really?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.920
Doing what?

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.620
He can't really talk about it.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.000
You show me what a
weather balloon looks

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
like at 5,000 feet, and
I will agree with you

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.330
and write the report.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.000
But until then, the
math says otherwise.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.920
You want to play chicken
at 3G's just prove a point?

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.670
All right.
I'll take you on a ride.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.000
Show you what those
numbers really mean.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.330
Look out.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.620
[engine zipping]

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.750
What's happening?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.460
We're going down.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.290
Brace yourself, Doc.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.380
MAN: What the hell
were you doing

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.710
up there in the first place?

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.330
Testing a theory.

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.210
I don't need you
disproving a theory.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.710
I need you to write
reports and close cases.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.380
And if you can't, I'll
find someone else who can.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.710
Where's the professor?

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.500
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.880
What is it about that song?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.710
This is how it communicated.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.500
The song playing
through your headset

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.540
could easily have come from
a radio station nearby.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.120
No.
No, no, no.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.460
This came from my hometown.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.210
I mean, I recognized
the familiar voice,

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.540
the DJ call sign.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.290
This is KKJH, San Diego.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.290
Logically, that's
not possible.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.080
Logic can't begin to explain
what we're dealing with here.

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.670
MAN: I can get a flight
back to DC from here.

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.330
I'll fill out the
report by myself then.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.170
I already filled it out.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.380
I sent it off this morning

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.420
Well, what did it say?

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.750
Just what we proved.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.750
That it was a weather balloon.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.080
The tank's a little low.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.500
Need to fill her up.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.920
This encounter goes
deeper than we think.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.080
At least, we may have another
candidate in our hands.

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.250
- What are you doing?
- It's OK.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.750
[grunting]

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.040
You won't remember a
thing when it's all over.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.380
[muffled radio voice]

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.460
There's something
you need to know.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.290
The song [inaudible] heard
from San Diego, it's--

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.290
Hey.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.620
He was telling the truth.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.080
I just confirmed it
with the radio station.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.540
MAN: Don't start with this.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.790
It's not just the song.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:05.380
I think there's
something more going on.

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.960
MAN: Connect it to
what just happened?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.620
What do you mean, connect it?

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.460
[muffled voices]

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.290
You know what?
I'm-- I'm wrong.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.120
I'm overthinking this.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.460
The case is closed.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.710
What are you not
telling me right now?

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.170
MAN: You're going
to rest easier now.

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.500
[music playing]
