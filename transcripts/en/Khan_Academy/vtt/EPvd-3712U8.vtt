00:00:00.312 --> 00:00:01.539
- [Instructor] We have, listed here...

00:00:01.539 --> 00:00:04.442
We know that carbon 12 is the most common

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:07.518
isotope of carbon on Earth.

00:00:07.518 --> 00:00:11.518
98.89% of the carbon
on Earth in carbon 12.

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.176
And we know that, by definition,

00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:18.593
its mass is exactly 12 atomic mass units.

00:00:20.374 --> 00:00:23.075
Now that's not the only
isotope of carbon on Earth.

00:00:23.075 --> 00:00:24.427
There are other isotopes.

00:00:24.427 --> 00:00:28.070
The next most frequent one is carbon 13.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.987
1.11% of the carbon on Earth is carbon 13.

00:00:32.942 --> 00:00:35.481
And we can experimentally find that

00:00:35.481 --> 00:00:38.648
its mass is 13.0034 atomic mass units.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.578
So, these numbers that we have here,

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:46.523
just as a review, these are atomic mass.

00:00:46.523 --> 00:00:48.356
These are atomic mass.

00:00:49.386 --> 00:00:50.984
And so, what we're gonna
think about, in this video,

00:00:50.984 --> 00:00:53.482
is how do they come up with
the atomic weight number

00:00:53.482 --> 00:00:56.800
that they'll give you on a
periodic table like that?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.300
So, atomic weight.

00:01:02.244 --> 00:01:04.535
Where does that come from?

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:07.688
Well, in the video on atomic
weight and on atomic mass,

00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:10.757
we see that the atomic weight
is the weighted average

00:01:10.757 --> 00:01:13.007
of the atomic masses of

00:01:13.007 --> 00:01:16.161
the various isotopes of that element.

00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:18.744
So, to find this roughly 12.01,

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.013
we take the weighted
average of these two things.

00:01:22.013 --> 00:01:23.036
And what do we weight it by?

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:27.203
We weight it by how common
that isotope actually is.

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:29.954
So, what we wanna do is,

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:34.486
we could take 98.89%
and multiply it by 12.

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:37.103
And I'll rewrite this
percentage as a decimal.

00:01:37.103 --> 00:01:39.436
So it'll be 0.9889 times 12.

00:01:43.285 --> 00:01:47.051
And, to that, we are going to add...

00:01:47.051 --> 00:01:50.801
We are going to add 1.11% times 13.0034.

00:01:54.786 --> 00:01:58.369
So, as a decimal, that's
going to be 0.011.

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:02.815
That's 1.11% is 0.011, oh, 111.

00:02:07.065 --> 00:02:11.232
And I'm gonna multiply that
times 13.0034 atomic mass units.

00:02:15.164 --> 00:02:16.884
So, what does that give us?

00:02:16.884 --> 00:02:18.602
Let's get our calculator out here.

00:02:18.602 --> 00:02:21.185
So, we are going to have 0.9889

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.828
times 12 is equal to 11.8668.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.215
And, to that, we are going to add...

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:36.632
We are going to add 0.0111 times 13.0034.

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:47.626
And I know it's going to do
this multiplication first

00:02:47.626 --> 00:02:50.100
because it's a calculator knows
about order of operations.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.267
And so, that's all going to be,
as you can see, 12.01113774,

00:02:57.057 --> 00:02:59.678
which, if you were to round
to the hundredths place,

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:03.405
is how this atomic weight was gotten.

00:03:03.405 --> 00:03:04.265
So that's that.

00:03:04.265 --> 00:03:05.098
There you go.

00:03:05.098 --> 00:03:06.966
That's how we calculate atomic weight.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.633
So, I can write this
as approximately 12.01.

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:15.229
It's the weighted average
of the atomic masses.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:17.153
Now, another thing that
you might want to note is,

00:03:17.153 --> 00:03:21.400
what's the difference between
carbon 12 and carbon 13?

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.833
Carbon 12, this right
over here, is six protons.

00:03:24.833 --> 00:03:26.632
The six protons are what make it carbon,

00:03:26.632 --> 00:03:28.799
so both of these will have six protons.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.680
And the difference is in the neutrons.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.860
This right over here has
six neutrons, six neutrons.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:35.841
And this, right over here,

00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:39.276
is gonna have one more
neutron, seven neutrons.

00:03:39.276 --> 00:03:42.551
So, when you look at the
difference in atomic mass,

00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:44.844
notice the change is...

00:03:44.844 --> 00:03:48.677
Looks like it's plus
1.0034 atomic mass units.

00:03:49.878 --> 00:03:51.393
So, from this, you can say, "Hey, look,

00:03:51.393 --> 00:03:52.908
if I add a neutron...

00:03:52.908 --> 00:03:54.325
Plus one neutron.

00:03:55.201 --> 00:03:56.470
Plus one neutron.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.923
It's roughly equal to
an atomic mass unit."

00:03:58.923 --> 00:04:00.683
It's not exactly an atomic mass unit,

00:04:00.683 --> 00:04:03.750
but, roughly speaking,
in a lot of very broad,

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.755
high-level terms, you can kind of view it

00:04:05.755 --> 00:04:08.291
as being very close to
one atomic mass unit.

00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:11.195
And the same thing is true of protons.

00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.120
Anyway, hopefully you now
have an appreciation for

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.535
the difference between atomic
mass, which is the mass,

00:04:15.535 --> 00:04:17.296
and atomic weight, which
is the weighted average

00:04:17.296 --> 00:04:21.998
of the various isotopes
of that element on Earth,

00:04:21.998 --> 00:04:23.098
how to calculate it,

00:04:23.098 --> 00:04:25.864
and roughly what the mass of a neutron is.
