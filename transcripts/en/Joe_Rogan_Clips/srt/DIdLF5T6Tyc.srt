1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,900
Not been the easiest weekend in
my life or my careers last week,

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,901
but hanging in there to make this a
standalone so that people don't have to go

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:12,300
figuring this out on their
own. And I'm sure many,

4
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:15,450
many fans are tuning in already
know that the gist of the details,

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,430
let's lay this out from the beginning.
John Jones initial failed test.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,541
Yeah.

7
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:26,541
So that was July of 2017 he tested
positive for approximately 20,

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,690
anywhere from 20 to 60 Pega grams of a
longterm metabolite known as the three

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,550
metabolite of a substance called
dihydro chloral methyl testosterone,

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,030
D, H, C M, T, also known
as oral to rentable.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,200
And this was over a year ago. Um,

12
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,140
what was determined to be
the source of this stuff,

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,480
never determined what the source was.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,320
So John went through a full
arbitration hearing, um,

15
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,690
was never able to determine
where it came from,

16
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,280
tested all the supplements he was
using, you know, went through many, uh,

17
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:06,270
interviews with USADA, had a
full on arbitration hearing. Uh,

18
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:08,250
the source was never
determined where it came from.

19
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,200
Why was his suspension so low
or so short? Well, I mean,

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,100
he wasn't determined.

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,240
So I mean there's many factors that
go into what that suspension was.

22
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:22,740
I w I would argue in the total totality
of the evidence that was presented in

23
00:01:22,741 --> 00:01:26,910
that arbitration, that it, that
it wasn't a short suspension. Um,

24
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,210
because really one key thing
came out at arbitration.

25
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:34,530
So John went to arbitration before an
individual by the name of Richard McLaren.

26
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,100
Richard McLaren has an arbitration group
up in Canada and McLaren is probably

27
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:44,160
worldwide known as one of the
most credible guys in anti-doping.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:49,610
I know you had the Icarus
producer director on the
McLaren report was the report

29
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:52,350
that came from all that.

30
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:56,850
He basically investigated the Russian
state being involved in doping and Sochi

31
00:01:56,851 --> 00:02:00,360
games and put out actually
a series of reports on it,

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,440
detailing that up to 1000
Russian athletes. Um, you know,

33
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:08,190
we're breaking the rules and the Russian
laboratory was helping them get around

34
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:11,310
it. So he's a very, very respected guy.

35
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:15,840
He's independent of obviously the
UFC. He's independent of USADA.

36
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,870
Um, he acts on his own and his
determination was his determination. Um,

37
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:23,430
and I'll read you kind
of what he said. He said,

38
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:28,431
I find that all evidence available to me
leads me to conclude that the violation

39
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,060
was not intended,

40
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,260
nor could it have enhanced
the athlete's performance.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,790
So a non-intentional, so
non-intentional ingestion.

42
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,650
I mean there's no argument
that it was in his system,

43
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,100
but he found the evidence
to show non-intentional use.

44
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,090
And then he went further saying that
based on the numbers of what he saw in the

45
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:52,950
evidence that was not even a performance
enhancing benefit afforded to John for

46
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:55,200
having this longterm
metabolite in his system.

47
00:02:55,201 --> 00:03:00,070
And I think that's significant when
you talk about Hey 15 was that, that's,

48
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,770
you know, kind of light being that
this is the second time through.

49
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,150
I would argue that if there was an
argument that maybe it's on the higher end

50
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:10,390
and certainly, you know, we'll talk
about the California commission.

51
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:15,190
Andy foster took that position, uh,
in John's recent California hearing,

52
00:03:15,191 --> 00:03:19,330
he was a little bit critical of
USADA. Um, he thought, you know,

53
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:22,780
he's intimately familiar with his evidence
both in the previous case and this

54
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:23,950
occurrence that,

55
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,880
and he also saw that there was no
evidence that an independent arbitrator,

56
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,710
you know, made this, uh, statement and
decision of John intentionally cheating.

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,050
Um, so if anything, you know,

58
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,710
I'd say that potentially there could be
an argument that, that it was, you know,

59
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:42,070
on the higher end versus the lower
end because of the fact that it was an

60
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,600
unintentional ingestion. Exactly.
What is John's excuse? What is,

61
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,500
what is John said how he got this
into his system. We'll look, you know,

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:54,880
it's detailed in the arbitration hearing
at all. John John fully admits that,

63
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:58,450
you know, some of the lifetime lifestyle
decisions he was making, you know,

64
00:03:58,451 --> 00:04:02,020
the partying and things, you
know, probably did not lead to,

65
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:06,190
to making smart decisions and making
smart choices in terms of what was being

66
00:04:06,191 --> 00:04:07,630
ingested in the body.

67
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,430
But certainly his testimony was under
oath that I have never intentionally

68
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,970
cheated and did not intentionally
put this substance in my body.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,110
And not only this case, but as we
talk about the subsequent case here,

70
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:23,650
I think you'll see that based
on the numbers, you know,

71
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:28,060
coming out of his tests and based on some
studies that have been done on some of

72
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:31,810
these substances, it would tend to support
that. Okay, correct me if I'm wrong,

73
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:36,811
but didn't John test negative then test
positive for extremely low numbers?

74
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,370
This is the initial test before we
get into the most recent field test.

75
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:45,450
He did test negative then test positive
very shortly after with a very small

76
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:51,190
trace amount. Correct. So you had two
negative tests on July 7th and July 8th,

77
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,700
I believe, of 2017 and then way in day,

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,380
I think it was July 28th,

79
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,580
he was positive for a very low
level of the [inaudible] metabolite.

80
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,830
And we might as well start here. So
again, going back to Icarus, remember,

81
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,790
remember the doctor,

82
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,940
I mean he's the main character in that
were Cenk of in 2011 he put out a study

83
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,630
on oral Toronto ball. Um, he actually,

84
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:21,631
my understanding is dosed himself and
then studied the excretion of his urine.

85
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:26,500
And what was coming out of it over the
weeks and months after and determined

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,520
that there was multiple,
maybe up to 50 metabolites,

87
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,270
that once this DH CMT was
ingested into the body,

88
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:39,160
the body converted into other substances
and these metabolites stayed around.

89
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,220
He identified some short term metabolites,

90
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,450
some medium term metabolites,
and some longterm metabolites,

91
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:49,210
specifically the M three that
John's tested positive for it.

92
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:54,040
So these longterm metabolites
would indicate that it
was taken a long time ago.

93
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,440
They would stay around
for the longest. Why?

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,040
Why was testing negative and then testing
positive for these extremely. So yeah,

95
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,930
that numbers, that's a
good question. And that's,

96
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,760
that's basically the question and point.

97
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:09,710
But what was not occurring and what has
never occurred in any of John's samples

98
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,870
is any presence of the short
and medium term metabolites.

99
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:19,100
And if you look at a rich Dankoff study,

100
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,640
he identifies a couple of
these medium term metabolites,

101
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:27,641
Roman numeral one and Roman numeral two
and he says these metabolites based on

102
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:32,600
his study will stay in the
body at least 22 days. W, well,

103
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:35,810
let's look back to the July 7th and
eighth you know, positive tests.

104
00:06:35,811 --> 00:06:39,740
He's negative on July 7th and eighth
for everything. For the parent compound,

105
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,240
for the short term,

106
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,270
medium term term metabolites and the
longterm metabolites go 2021 days later.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,570
So within that 22 day window,

108
00:06:50,571 --> 00:06:53,750
which is study shows the short and
medium term metabolites would still be

109
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:58,520
showing up and there's no presence
whatsoever of the short or medium term

110
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,760
metabolites. Now again, we'll
get into this a little bit more,

111
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:03,020
but I think the science,

112
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:07,880
what it's showing is a pulsing
effect for this longterm metabolite.

113
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,040
Meaning once you ingest,

114
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,070
whether intentionally or
not unintentionally oral
torrented ball into the body,

115
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,040
the body breaks it down, produces short
term and medium term, which is you know,

116
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,000
visible for a short and
medium amount of time.

117
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,110
And then this [inaudible] which is
produced for a long period of time,

118
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,370
I think with the issue appears
to be, and we'll get into this,

119
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:34,190
the UFC program is not the
only program that seen this.

120
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:37,910
There's another professional sports
league that has seen it very frequently.

121
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,610
You saw it as also seen
this on the Olympic side,

122
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,650
but we're seeing this strange action
with the longterm and three metabolite.

123
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:49,050
And the theory is it may be hiding, um,

124
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,900
in the fat tissues surrounding organs and
maybe have a pulsing effect where it's

125
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:57,800
released at certain times and
other times you can't detect it.

126
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,730
And this is not the actual substance
itself, but it's a metabolite correct.

127
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,720
Which indicates a reaction
to this substance indicates
the body breaking down.

128
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:05,960
Okay.

129
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,190
The parent compound the oral terenna ball
and turning it into these other things

130
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,230
which are stored in the body.

131
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,230
So those metabolites are not performance
enhancing drugs that are the result of

132
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,020
the breakdown of the
parent drug in the body.

133
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,520
How much time is it detectable,
the actual drug itself?

134
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:25,610
So pretty quick, uh, it's a
pretty quick clearance time.

135
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,910
I think we're chunk off study
says, you know, maybe a week. Uh,

136
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,360
so it's not around for very long and
that's why he conducted the study

137
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,770
ironically enough.

138
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,250
And I was going to go watch
bickers here last night and I just,

139
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:41,300
I've had too much going on in the last
week to kind of refresh my mind. But, um,

140
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,920
apparently he, he knew this was part
of his protocol for Russian athletes.

141
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,570
He knew a coach that was still giving
the oral Taranto ball to Russian athletes

142
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,220
and he had a falling out with the coach.

143
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,640
So he goes off on the side and Hey the
parent compounds going to get in and out

144
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:00,810
of the body pretty quick. It's going
to be difficult to detect that.

145
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,290
Let's try to figure out what stays around
and leaves markers in the body for a

146
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:04,921
long time.

147
00:09:04,921 --> 00:09:09,180
And so he developed these short and
longterm metabolite tests and was able to

148
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,710
catch some of this coaches athletes for
using the oral to rentable. Interesting.

149
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,710
So the actual drug itself
has gone from the system,

150
00:09:16,711 --> 00:09:20,650
but the metabolite remains now
what is the window that the,

151
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,430
this metabolite is supposed
to be detectable in the body?

152
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:27,030
Cause we're talking now, what do we
at like 18 months? So here's the,

153
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:29,360
here's the problem. Was
that initial ingestion? Yep.

154
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,970
Cause my question is these
same longterm metabolites,

155
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,140
these existed a year plus
ago. It was more than a year.

156
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,610
How long ago that that's so
July, 2017 was your initial test.

157
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,660
So with all the experts,

158
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,930
and we'll get through this with all the
experts are telling us is that there is

159
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:50,931
no evidence of re ingestion and most
likely this is still remnants from the

160
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:56,370
July, 2017 tests. However it
was to enter into a system.

161
00:09:56,940 --> 00:10:00,330
And we'll go through some of these
testing numbers that have shown negatives

162
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:04,680
followed by very low level Peka
Peka gram quantities. You know,

163
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:09,681
was that the ingestion that happened that
he tested positive for in July of 2017

164
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:15,810
indicated a longterm effect rate.
It was a longterm term metabolite,

165
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,260
correct. So meaning it had already
been assistant for a year or so.

166
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:21,450
It absolutely could
have predated, you know,

167
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:25,110
the theory the first time through was
something had to have entered his system

168
00:10:25,111 --> 00:10:30,030
between July 7th and July
8th those negatives and this
low peak gram reading on

169
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:33,150
July 28th over this last year,

170
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,570
there's been a lot of study into this
longterm metabolite. As I mentioned,

171
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,250
this isn't just a UFC issue.

172
00:10:38,251 --> 00:10:42,270
There's another major professional sports
league that for the time being wants

173
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,280
to keep their, their testing confidential,

174
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:48,660
but they've shared that information with
scientists, with USADA, with myself.

175
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,700
They saw it on multiple
occasions as pulsing effect
over a year where you'd see,

176
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,810
but this is positive. Tell over a year.
We're talking two and a half years now,

177
00:10:57,811 --> 00:10:59,910
right. If it's a year, if it's a,

178
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,260
if in July he had July, 2017 you were
talking a year and a half, right?

179
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:06,030
July, 2017 correct.

180
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:10,580
July 17 but it could have been in his
system a year prior. I don't know. Yeah,

181
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,750
it could have been a couple of
months a year. I don't know.

182
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:16,980
He'd never showed up for that N three
metabolite four you'd been tested for it.

183
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,240
He had been tested multiple times in the
programming from wrong isn't the same

184
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:22,780
level, isn't it?

185
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Approximately the same Pika grams that
exists today in 2018 that were there in

186
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:33,930
2017 generally if you look and
we can go over these numbers, it,

187
00:11:33,931 --> 00:11:35,520
it fluctuates, you know,

188
00:11:35,521 --> 00:11:39,730
from single digits and never gets into
triple digits to mid double digit.

189
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:43,500
So there is some as low as nine
peak grams over that time. Um,

190
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,060
there was some at 60 Pika grams, however,

191
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,860
a peak of gram to someone because it's
a preposterously small. It's insane.

192
00:11:49,861 --> 00:11:53,470
And you know the, the analogy
that I heard early on was,

193
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,100
and I think John uses throw a pinch of
salt in Olympic swimming pool and I'm

194
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:59,950
like, okay, well that's kind
of wrap your head around.

195
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,000
Now let's go the other side.

196
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,780
Let's talk about something really small
that we know of and how many times you

197
00:12:04,781 --> 00:12:08,380
have to break down that small
particle to get to a peak of gram.

198
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,800
So one grain of salt. I mean, we all
know what that looks like, right?

199
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,090
You put that in front of you and you
split that. And I had mentioned this week,

200
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:18,580
50 million, it's actually 58 million.

201
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:23,260
If you split that 58 million times the
grain installed each one as a Pika gram.

202
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,690
I mean it's in comprehensible,

203
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,100
the detection level and how
small that is. It really is.

204
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:34,150
It's crazy. And how many Pico
grams did they find in his system?

205
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,690
So he's gone from, and I'll, I'll
read through it here. So here's,

206
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,170
here's since the initial appearance
of the N three metabolite,

207
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,800
here's what John's tests look
like and those Pico gram readings.

208
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:49,801
So the first one was
collection date was July 28th,

209
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,860
2017. He had a concentration
of 80 Pika grams.

210
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:57,700
However, let me caution, and I'll
read something from, from an expert.

211
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,320
When you get down to
these picogram levels, um,

212
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,770
the science is somewhat in exact
because it's such a small amount.

213
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,020
So the variable, the plus or minus,
you know, can be anywhere from 2030.

214
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:15,460
I've seen in some instances 50 or
60. So what this scientist's name?

215
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,350
His name is Larry Bowers. Um, he was
formerly the, the USADA science director.

216
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:22,990
He's currently retired and
independently consults.

217
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,030
Before that he ran an Olympic,
uh, Olympic committee,

218
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,790
uh, accredited laboratory at
the university of Indiana.

219
00:13:30,791 --> 00:13:35,170
The guy who's got 20 to 25
years of anti-doping experience.

220
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:39,370
Here's what he, he told me
about, uh, you know, when you're,

221
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,760
when you're analyzing
small picogram levels,

222
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,120
although the two lab, uh,

223
00:13:46,121 --> 00:13:49,750
respective laboratories
report a concentration,

224
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:53,260
I would caution against becoming
too fixated on the numbers. First,

225
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:56,830
the numbers are really estimates of
concentration and probably should be

226
00:13:56,831 --> 00:14:00,640
considered a range of about plus
or minus 20 picograms per ML.

227
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:04,490
And he said that December 9th result
would be in the range of John's a.

228
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:08,260
We'll get to that between 60 and a
hundred second while the adjustment of

229
00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:11,860
concentration by specific gravity
attempts to deal with the variability of

230
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:14,560
urinary excretion rates, it is an exact,

231
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:19,000
it is inexact and adds variability
to the estimates. Finally,

232
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:19,751
most importantly,

233
00:14:19,751 --> 00:14:24,130
science has no clear understanding of the
variance of urinary excretion of drugs

234
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,670
that alter trace concentration.
So basically saying, look,

235
00:14:27,671 --> 00:14:30,820
I mean we have a general idea
how this works in science, but,

236
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,670
and I think this instance comes to play,

237
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,020
be real careful if you're going to be
the guy with the pseudoscience out there

238
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:38,920
saying, wait a second,

239
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:43,921
John jumped from 20 to 60 from September
to December and that means he re

240
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,690
ingested it. What he is saying
here is slow your roll on that.

241
00:14:48,691 --> 00:14:53,691
That that it's such a small
in comprehensible level
that we don't really know

242
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:56,210
what those variances are
going to look like. Now,

243
00:14:56,211 --> 00:14:59,780
I think if we saw jumps and John from
single single-digit eight or nine Pika

244
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:02,750
gram to multiple hundred digit Pika grams,

245
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,870
there would be a concern and maybe
some [inaudible] administration,

246
00:15:05,871 --> 00:15:07,370
but the experts I've speaking to,

247
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:12,371
when you're talking variability of 10
2030 40 it's not that significant at the

248
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,210
peak of gram level.

249
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:19,070
What is the window where this longterm
metabolites starts to express itself?

250
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,340
Like what you said, there's short
term and there's medium term.

251
00:15:22,341 --> 00:15:25,560
This is the longterm. How long
does it take before the launch?

252
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,340
That's a good question. I
don't have the answer to that.

253
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,750
It may be in [inaudible] report here and
I would encourage those that are home,

254
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:36,530
you know, playing playing scientist
at, at their computer. Uh,

255
00:15:36,531 --> 00:15:40,520
the journal of steroid biochemistry
and molecular biology, uh,

256
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:44,120
raw chink OV writes report
detection and mass spec

257
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,610
spectrometric characterization of
novel longterm dehydro chloro method,

258
00:15:49,611 --> 00:15:51,650
testosterone metabolites and human urine.

259
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,730
I'm not sure when that
longterm metabolite, how
long it takes to to show up.

260
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,050
Here's the problem though with this
substance. He did a real brief study.

261
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,810
My understanding is
administered it to himself.

262
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:07,220
That's the only study that
exists. Oral Taranto ball,

263
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,050
D, H C M T to my understanding is not
approved for use for human consumption

264
00:16:12,051 --> 00:16:15,440
consumption anywhere,
anywhere in any country.

265
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,660
So you can't have clinical
trials ethically in the
medical world because it's

266
00:16:20,661 --> 00:16:25,640
just not legal to give this
to human beings. So, you know,

267
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:29,300
we're, we're already kind of behind
the eight ball here and that, you know,

268
00:16:29,301 --> 00:16:32,870
as compared to other substances where
you can do clinical trials cause they're

269
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:37,400
readily available via prescription
or whatever, this substance is not,

270
00:16:37,401 --> 00:16:42,170
the substance was created by the East
Germans in the seventies and eighties and

271
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:46,100
was part of their state sponsored doping
program where they were doping their

272
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,660
athletes. Can you correct me if I'm wrong,

273
00:16:47,661 --> 00:16:52,220
but I believe what I've read is that this
is particularly effective when people

274
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:56,360
are cutting weight. Yeah. I mean
is that true or is this just more,

275
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,060
I don't know about that. I
think some may be confusing.

276
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,310
Torrential with oral Toronto ball,

277
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,300
two completely different substances
actually very important. Yeah. There's,

278
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:07,460
there's very different
effects on the body.

279
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:11,990
There's very different windows in terms
of detection time ex explain that. Yeah.

280
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:15,770
You gotta be really careful in this
world of performance enhancing drugs.

281
00:17:15,771 --> 00:17:19,130
There's names that are interchangeable.
There's different, you know,

282
00:17:19,131 --> 00:17:22,250
chemical names where you change a
little bit of that chemical name.

283
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,950
It could mean me in a
completely different substance.

284
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,590
There's instances where the
chemical name is different,

285
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:29,480
but the substance is actually the same.

286
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,740
So when trying to compare
two substances, you know,

287
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,690
make sure if you're at
home doing that analysis,

288
00:17:35,691 --> 00:17:39,860
you're comparing the right ones straight
to rent a ball is different than oral

289
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:43,220
to rentable. What is the difference?
Uh, yeah, I can't tell you,

290
00:17:43,221 --> 00:17:47,630
I'm not as familiar with Toronto ball
other than it's not oral to rentable. So,

291
00:17:47,631 --> 00:17:51,600
but there is a difference in terms the
detection window. Yeah, there would be,

292
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,160
I mean different substances create and
throw out different metabolites. Um,

293
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:59,120
and different substances have
different detection windows.

294
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:02,790
So I haven't done my study in research
on straight to rent a ball other than

295
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,670
knowing it's different than
the substance here. So, uh,

296
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,010
Gregory Richie Dankoff that's
how you say his last name, right?

297
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,110
He was the only guy to do an
actual verified study. Correct.

298
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:16,550
Know? Is this study been, is it been peer
reviewed? Yeah, I mean it will. It's,

299
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,670
it's published in

300
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:22,020
the journal of steroid
biochemistry and molecular biology.

301
00:18:22,021 --> 00:18:24,720
So in order to get something published,
it needs to be peer reviewed.

302
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:28,790
So th it's, has it been replicated
anywhere? Not that I'm aware of. No.

303
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,960
So it's just so we have one study
which is really fascinating, right?

304
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,520
So we know that first of all, we
know this is an effect of steroids.

305
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:38,910
We know it works. Yeah. They use Germans
I think showed that they wouldn't be a,

306
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,450
had been using it. Um, it, it's
not a difficult, it's not a easy,

307
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:44,760
easy substance to get ahold of. Look,

308
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:48,450
when it's not approved for
use anywhere in the world, um,

309
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,730
it's only available on
the black market. Um,

310
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:54,690
so you probably have to go to China
to get it manufactured or, you know,

311
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:58,680
research chemical supply company.
It's not supposed to be provided to,

312
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:01,170
to humans. Now, I'm certainly
not attributing this to you,

313
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,370
but there were rumors,
this was one discussion.

314
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,080
Was that one of the possible
ways he could have ingested this,

315
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,860
um, and this be very kind,
John likes to party. Okay.

316
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,410
One of the things about
partying is people do cocaine.

317
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,650
One of the things about cocaine is
sometimes cocaine is cut with Creotine.

318
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:23,460
One of the things about creatine is
oftentimes you're buying cheap. Creatine.

319
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,480
I spent a little, one of the things
that we've had with on it on, it's our,

320
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:31,320
our products are all third party
verified, but in the initial goings,

321
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,770
when we tried different, uh,
manufacturers, especially for alpha brain,

322
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,610
we found there were other trace elements
that were in alpha brain that weren't

323
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:39,444
supposed to be in there.

324
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:42,420
And it's because of the vats that
they mix these things up with.

325
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:47,930
And one of the things that we had heard
was that creatine oftentimes is made in

326
00:19:47,971 --> 00:19:51,270
the same place where they might
be making oral terenna ball.

327
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:52,860
They might be making antibodies,

328
00:19:52,861 --> 00:19:56,850
they might be making a bunch of different
things and trace amounts of this stuff

329
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,530
can get into the creatine. They use
creatine to cut cocaine with, is this,

330
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:05,400
is this possible or am I just, yeah,
it's, it's absolutely a theory. I don't,

331
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:07,660
you know, I, I can't sit
here and said that happen,

332
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:10,650
but I will have heard similar
things. I have heard similar things.

333
00:20:10,651 --> 00:20:13,710
I know for a fact, based
on my previous career,

334
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,740
I worked closely with the
DEA. I was with the FDA.

335
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:20,670
I worked cases involving street
distribution of recreational drugs,

336
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:21,510
including cocaine.

337
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:26,511
I know for a fact that 10 is one of the
most common substances that cocaine is

338
00:20:26,671 --> 00:20:31,560
cut with because of the more little look.
Yeah, some more color, some more feel.

339
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:35,090
So getting back to McLaren's
arbitration decision, I mean this,

340
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:38,070
this is publicly available records,
so I'm not saying anything new,

341
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:42,720
but McLaren addresses at least
John's lifestyle around this time.

342
00:20:42,721 --> 00:20:47,470
And he says the athlete openly admitted
to USADA that prior to and for period of

343
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,640
time after the reporting of his second
adverse analytical finding on July 28

344
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:55,960
2017, the athlete used elicit
so-called street drugs,

345
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:59,650
including cocaine. Now for
me to sit here and say, Hey,

346
00:20:59,651 --> 00:21:00,640
that's where it came from.

347
00:21:00,641 --> 00:21:03,250
I don't know that that's the time
period he's talking about the,

348
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,890
the athlete admitted, um,

349
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,410
that prior to and for a period of time
after the reporting of his second adverse

350
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:15,310
analytical finding on
July 27, 2017 admitted.

351
00:21:15,311 --> 00:21:19,720
So before that test and
sometime after. Okay.

352
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,950
So does that make sense though?
If it's cut, if that's what,

353
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,600
where the source of it is,

354
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,310
does it make sense that that would
show up as a longterm metabolite?

355
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,340
Doesn't it need a long time in the body
to digest or do we not know enough about

356
00:21:35,501 --> 00:21:37,690
the window of time? Yeah.

357
00:21:37,691 --> 00:21:40,570
I don't know if we know enough about
the window of time, you know, my,

358
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:45,600
my theory and looking at it is even
if there's a small amount of the oral

359
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,280
terenna ball in that it's going to
for a period of time show that parent

360
00:21:51,281 --> 00:21:56,260
compound at a small peak of gram amount
and the short and midterm metabolites in

361
00:21:56,261 --> 00:21:57,580
the small Pika gram amount.

362
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:01,240
We have never seen those in
the history of John's testing.

363
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:03,280
It's only this longterm metabolite.

364
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,730
So that may be indication
that it occurred.

365
00:22:06,731 --> 00:22:09,130
Maybe even prior to what
we're talking about here.

366
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:14,340
Is it something that could be accentuated
in some way by the weight cutting

367
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:18,500
process? I absolutely think
that could be a factor. Um,

368
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,110
there is studies not
necessarily with this, but, uh,

369
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:24,370
another substance clomiphene and look,

370
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:28,540
I want that while I'm cautioning people
to be careful about comparing different

371
00:22:28,541 --> 00:22:32,050
substances. The commonality
between clomiphene,

372
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,070
which there are multiple clinical studies
on cause it is approved for use to be

373
00:22:36,071 --> 00:22:40,780
distributed to humans and oral terenna
ball is they're both chlorinated.

374
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,470
So they both contain a
chlorine atom on the molecule.

375
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:49,860
And there is a recently published study
on clomiphene and its excretion rates.

376
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,730
Um, again for those at home
that want to look it up.

377
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:58,360
The study was published in the
endocrine society publication.

378
00:22:58,361 --> 00:22:59,380
It's pure reviewed.

379
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,780
The name of it is HPT access effects and
urinary detection following clomiphene

380
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:09,150
administration and males. So what
they did is they basically, you know,

381
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,140
got a group of males, um, gave
them, uh, a one month, um,

382
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,180
cycle of clomiphene, you know,

383
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:21,181
I think 25 milligrams a day and then had
them get off and then continue to look

384
00:23:21,881 --> 00:23:25,030
at their urine up to 261 days after.

385
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,740
And what you saw and what you see in
this study is that pulsing effect.

386
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,760
So, you know, I'm looking at some
of the study subjects here. Um,

387
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,940
subject one on day one 21 still
showed a 147 Pika grams of clomiphene.

388
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:44,110
Day one 28 showed a 174 Pika grams.

389
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,330
Day one 35 shows nothing.

390
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:50,690
He's below the minimum
coating reporting limit.

391
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:56,170
And then day one 49 he's back
up to two 36 there are one,

392
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,240
two, three, four, five,

393
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:04,510
six out of I think 12 subjects in that
study that showed this pulsing effect of

394
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,250
this chlorinated substance coming
and going again. You know, it's,

395
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:12,170
it's different than oral torrented ball,

396
00:24:12,171 --> 00:24:16,820
but it has that common factor of
being chlorinated in this study.

397
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,320
They do talk about, I'm
a fat tissue called the,

398
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:24,260
let me look this up and make sure
I got this right. Adipose tissue,

399
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,530
this is fat that surrounds
the internal organs.

400
00:24:27,531 --> 00:24:30,590
It's one of the last things that the
body burns when it's going, you know,

401
00:24:30,591 --> 00:24:34,370
starving itself and going to fat.
It protects those organs. But yeah,

402
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,470
you look at these, you know,

403
00:24:36,471 --> 00:24:40,070
extreme weight gains and cuts
that the UFC athlete goes through.

404
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:45,050
I don't think you're going
to find possibly another
human subject anywhere that

405
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:49,010
goes through putting weight on
other than cutting wrestling, maybe.

406
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:53,360
I don't think Olympic wrestling
matches with an MMA fighter. Um,

407
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,470
goes through at least, you know,

408
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,950
in my experience over these three or four
years talking to those in the Olympic

409
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:00,270
world. I think we're at
the extreme and it's,

410
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:03,500
it's something obviously we've talked
about before, we're trying to curtail,

411
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,030
but you know, there's,

412
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:09,800
there's clearly never been a study for
anybody who dehydrates and ReadWrite

413
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:13,100
hydrates themselves to the extent
that some of our athletes do.

414
00:25:13,101 --> 00:25:17,180
You can never find that would never
be anybody with any ethics that would

415
00:25:17,181 --> 00:25:20,690
support a study because some of that
dehydration exceeds world health

416
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,410
organization standards. So there's
no studies out there, you know,

417
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,730
on this stuff. But clearly,
you know, looking from afar I,

418
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:31,610
I'd say that it likely has some impact
over what's being released by this

419
00:25:31,611 --> 00:25:35,310
adipose tissue. We should certainly talk
about that in the future, about the,

420
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,620
the weight cutting aspect of it.

421
00:25:36,621 --> 00:25:41,621
So th but this adipose tissue loss at
extreme weight cuts could potentially be

422
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:45,650
the reason why this stuff
is excluding itself.

423
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,740
It's definitely a theory out
there. What about micro-dosing?

424
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,220
So here's the thing with micro-dosing
micro-dosing is done with endogenous

425
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:57,620
substances. So only test it. Well, I mean,

426
00:25:57,621 --> 00:25:59,090
someone could try it with something else,

427
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:03,770
but the reason you microdose with
endogenous substances is they're already

428
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:06,740
produced in the body. Right?
So the theory of, okay,

429
00:26:06,741 --> 00:26:08,870
I'm going to microdose oral terenna ball,

430
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,390
will oral Toronto balls still producing
the short term and longterm metabolites

431
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:15,590
in theory,

432
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:20,650
whether you're taking a hundred milligrams
or one milligram of oral torrented

433
00:26:20,961 --> 00:26:21,794
ball,

434
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,550
those excretion rates of those metabolites
are still going to be consistent.

435
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,970
They're going to be in
a much smaller level,

436
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:31,520
a way to bypass those excretion rates.
Is there a way to mask that in some way?

437
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:35,180
I'm not aware of any
IPOs. Go ahead. I'm sorry.

438
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:39,920
The only study we have is Gregory.
Correct? That's it. Correct. But you know,

439
00:26:39,921 --> 00:26:43,800
just taking it from a common
sense approach, it's, you know,

440
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:47,730
those that know about micro grossing
know that you microdose with endogenous

441
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,421
substances,

442
00:26:48,421 --> 00:26:51,540
things that are already appearing in the
body so your body knows what to do with

443
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:53,970
them, knows what to do and
you're fooling, you know,

444
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:57,870
not only are these metabolizing
and there's no metabolites of them,

445
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:00,870
but you could also be fooling
the biological passport.

446
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,900
That's the concern I think
and why people microdose.

447
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,800
So you saw it as looking not only
testing for specific substances,

448
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:11,760
but our testosterone
epitestosterone ratios going up.

449
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,570
They're looking at at blood values,
how many young red blood cells,

450
00:27:15,571 --> 00:27:17,280
how many mature red blood cells.

451
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:21,750
So microdosing in those two areas
wouldn't set off alarms in the biological

452
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,490
passport world. Um,

453
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,110
I'd never heard personally of microdosing
of exotic substances that are not

454
00:27:28,111 --> 00:27:29,340
found in the body.

455
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,800
Microdosing in my understanding has done
with things that are indogenous body

456
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,330
for people that are not
familiar with this terminology,

457
00:27:36,331 --> 00:27:40,430
we're just talking about microdosing
performance enhancing drugs because a

458
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:45,470
microdosing in today's world is a very
common thing with mushrooms and LSD and a

459
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:46,460
lot of right.

460
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:51,000
I mean I saw a ton of microdosing in
the cycling world that was testicles,

461
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,710
testosterone, EPO, H HGH, H, all
those natural occurring in the body.

462
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,020
And so they don't produce any
really a red flag metabolites.

463
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,480
If you do them at very,
very small levels, they'll,

464
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:07,740
the parent will clear quickly not produce
any metabolites and will not throw off

465
00:28:07,741 --> 00:28:10,380
the biological passport analysis. Um,

466
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:15,470
is there a what you mean when Victor
Kanye came out with a clear and all that

467
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:20,010
stuff with BALCO, they were
fooling people. Is it, is it,

468
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,580
I mean one of the things that we've talked
about before is that it's a constant

469
00:28:23,581 --> 00:28:28,410
race to try to keep up with more
advanced cheaters. It is. And you know,

470
00:28:28,411 --> 00:28:29,370
what's interesting in this,

471
00:28:29,371 --> 00:28:32,640
I mean without a talk to you and maybe
the first time we did talk a couple of

472
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:34,920
years ago, um, it, it's
come a long way from them,

473
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:37,770
but clearly if I would
have talked to you 15, 16,

474
00:28:37,771 --> 00:28:40,830
17 years ago when I got my
start in the anti-doping world,

475
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:45,270
I would have told you definitively
the testing is way behind, you know,

476
00:28:45,271 --> 00:28:48,540
what's being used out there.
Um, they were testing,

477
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,140
able to test to multiple
nanogram, um, limits.

478
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:56,910
That's as far down as we can go. Now they
can go down to single digit Pika gram.

479
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,930
There's another professional sports
league out there that recently had a one

480
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,720
Pika gram and three metabolite case.

481
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,030
I mean do the math coming down from
you know, four or five nanograms,

482
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:14,031
which used to be the lower limit now
to one peak of gram ten thousand twenty

483
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:14,640
thousand times.

484
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,640
I am almost under the theory that the
pendulum has swung maybe a little bit too

485
00:29:20,251 --> 00:29:25,170
far in the other direction and that that
certainly is part of my job to the UFC.

486
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:28,380
Look, I want to catch every
intentional cheater that's out there.

487
00:29:28,381 --> 00:29:30,660
I want to make sure we
have a rock solid program,

488
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:35,610
use all the latest and greatest,
you know, um, techniques to do it.

489
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,510
But I also want to keep an eye on it
to make sure it's being administrated

490
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,540
fairly. And when you're getting
down to detection of one, you know,

491
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:45,280
single digit Pika grams,

492
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,200
I have a concern that what kind of level
of sensitivity we're talking about.

493
00:29:50,201 --> 00:29:54,070
Are we going to talk about environmental
contamination where you walk, you know,

494
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,610
through a room and somebody has just
opened a container of something and

495
00:29:57,611 --> 00:30:00,220
there's, you know, minuscule
powders in the air.

496
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,390
There are documented cases that some of
the regularly prescribed prescription

497
00:30:04,391 --> 00:30:07,420
drugs, specifically diuretics,

498
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,900
are getting in water supplies
in some areas. You know,

499
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:14,020
you get a lot of old people on
them that flushed their old, um,

500
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,190
pills down the toilet.

501
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:19,540
There's documented cases of it getting
into the water supply and being

502
00:30:19,541 --> 00:30:23,740
detectable at that peak and gram
level. So you've gotta be really,

503
00:30:23,741 --> 00:30:26,380
really careful about that.
And I think, you know,

504
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,620
this case exemplifies that you Sada and,

505
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,660
and really the world anti-doping agency
world and community are aware of that.

506
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,160
Um, you know, with greater sensitivity
and testing, in my opinion,

507
00:30:39,161 --> 00:30:39,994
because you know,

508
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,240
makes greater responsibility to be
objective and look fairly at what really

509
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,760
we're doing here when we're
detecting in that small amount.
