00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:06.180
Hey,

It's bill burn.
It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:08.520
Just before Friday.

Just checking in to see how your week's going.</v>

5
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:18.990
This isn't it.
Never.
This never is.

6
00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:23.400
Nor is it ever meant to be an official podcast.
All right.

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.020
I'm just fucking just,
just popping in real quick.
Little fucking half hour,

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.830
you know.
See now your workouts.
Go and see how you drive home.
Still went.

9
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:39.060
Are you listening at work?
Oh,
you set up a pitch.
God bless you.
God bless you.

10
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:44.040
If you can get away with it.
I woke up today,
boot alluded and I've,

11
00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.760
I've had this fucking song in my head and I might want to fast forward.

12
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.540
I've,
I forgot how the lyrics go.
Was something like,

13
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:56.541
so I'll give you a kiss after the loving

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.970
Bata Doo Doo bop,
bop,
Bop,
Bop Bop who sang that song?

15
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.120
[inaudible].
That's one of those fucking guys
who's probably,
you know,

16
00:01:09.121 --> 00:01:11.790
when you recorded it is younger than I am,
but when I look him up,

17
00:01:11.791 --> 00:01:14.550
he's going to look like he's a 106.
Let's see,

18
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.460
after the loving lyrics.

19
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.730
You guys remember that one?
Oh,
oh,
ankle bird.
Humperdink

20
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.200
<v 0>yeah.</v>

21
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.950
<v 1>Engelbert Humperdinck where the fuck is it?</v>

22
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.660
The Millennium Collection.
The millennial collection.

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.520
Can we ever theories of thongs that are safe for everybody?

24
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.280
Could that be okay?
Sorry.
Get my shitty recorded them on the road here.

25
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.830
Um,
just for the millennials.
Oh,

26
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.930
it's so us sing you to sleep after the Levin with this song I just wrote

27
00:01:55.011 --> 00:02:00.011
yesterday and I hope you can hear what the worlds and the abuse it out again.

28
00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940
Why?
I don't know.
The rest of the fucking song goes,
that's one of those songs.

29
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.930
All you know is after the Levin and you just sit there and mumbling along.

30
00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.143
[inaudible]

31
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.193
<v 3>so</v>

32
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.100
<v 1>after the loving,
right.
Oh fuck.</v>

33
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.880
Oh my God.
That just reminded me of a fucking joke.
I want to do
a,

34
00:02:26.881 --> 00:02:30.390
wait a second.
I gotta write this sweet

35
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.060
Caroline.
Fuck you comment.
Uh,

36
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.240
red socks.
I got s one of the most stressful gigs.

37
00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:41.190
This is the last stress will gig I have all year.

38
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.700
I got past all the fucking press,
you know what I mean?

39
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.660
So all the press I had to do for that fucking thing.
You sit down,
you like,

40
00:02:48.661 --> 00:02:50.710
how's this gonna go?
How's this one guy?

41
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.030
That one going to go and you get all through it,
right.

42
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.860
I had a bunch of fucking,
you know,
I did that Gig for the cops.

43
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.680
The motorcycle cops in California got somehow got through that one.

44
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.500
I wasn't sure how that was going to go.
That one ended up going great.

45
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.860
I got one last fucking thing.
And once I get past this Gig,

46
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.630
I have nothing but comfort zone gigs for the rest of my year.

47
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.680
Today I'm on a roast.
Uh,

48
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.560
they're retiring David Ortiz's number and uh,

49
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.570
he wanted to have a roast for his,
um,
for his charity.

50
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.690
And what's hilarious is I don't think he's going to understand most of the shit.

51
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.350
Like he,
one of the comedians he was talking to,
sending,
you know,
I went out,

52
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:34.960
I laughed when other people laugh.
But you talk real fast.

53
00:03:34.961 --> 00:03:37.060
I don't understand what a lot of it is fucking,

54
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:40.210
which I understand cause I went to the Dominican Republican,

55
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.350
they started roasting me.
I'd be like,
Eh,
I just keep waiting for them.

56
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.640
A roll hall.
That's the word I'd be waiting for.
Are they talking about

57
00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.210
Cabasa Roho whatever the fuck they gonna say.
Oh the okay base.

58
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.520
However the fuck you it.
I don't know.
So,
um,
I got some good ones.

59
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.330
I got some good ones.
Uh,
how do you roast David Ortiz?
You know,

60
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.220
fucking grumps their,
uh,
petroleum is going to be there and you know,

61
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.960
these are all athletes that played for Boston teams,

62
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:19.920
so all of them have won championships.
That's just how it is around here.
People,

63
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.960
this isn't like your towns where roasting one of your local athletes,

64
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.220
three out of the four sports,
you know,
maybe you won one championship,

65
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.990
it'd be a fucking joke.

66
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.970
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

67
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.240
<v 1>See what other city would be hard?
New York,
you can fucking destroy people.</v>

68
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.530
Fucking destroy people.
Cause I don't think there's anybody left on the Yankees

69
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.550
and that God knows football team's turnover.
He couldn't really fun.
I mean,
Ely,

70
00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:50.120
you,
they always just make fun out where he looks.
Let me get trashed.

71
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:52.880
The next trash the mets trashed the rangers,

72
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.180
those Brooklyn fucking teams.

73
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:58.280
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

74
00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.940
<v 1>That have to be like a two part fucking roast.
Pittsburgh be a hard place,</v>

75
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.150
you know,
that'd be a hard place.

76
00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.870
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

77
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.220
<v 1>By maybe you can trash the pirates.</v>

78
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.680
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

79
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.870
<v 1>But I mean fucking penguins back to back and they've won.</v>

80
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.510
They've won three with Crosby

81
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.240
big Ben's one to,
and you know,

82
00:05:19.241 --> 00:05:21.490
a bunch of his shit would be taken off to test how it works.

83
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:24.440
They take it off the table.
I don't want to talk about that.
Hey Gay,

84
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.220
could you not?
Um,
so anyways,
I just have to get through this.

85
00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.060
So I figure I'm going to sit there and get called a cancer patient for fucking

86
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:37.510
an hour.
Uh,
they'll make fun of my black wife and then I just,

87
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.480
all I gotta do is just go up there for 10 minutes.
It trashed David Ortiz.
I mean,

88
00:05:42.481 --> 00:05:43.314
it's going to be fun.

89
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:50.070
I so want to tell you some of the jokes,

90
00:05:50.071 --> 00:05:53.880
but I know you constant got a tweet them and then people will read them before I

91
00:05:53.881 --> 00:05:55.770
get there.
And I need every laugh I can get.
I'm,

92
00:05:55.771 --> 00:05:58.460
I literally was writing this shit.

93
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:02.960
Like I can't sit down and write,
I can't do it.
You know,

94
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.150
let's think of how I read out loud.
Okay,

95
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:10.130
now imagine me trying to put those words down onto a piece of paper.
Okay.

96
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.253
Um,

97
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.390
how I do it is I put my daughter in the stroller and I walk around the block,

98
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:22.370
a big huge walk around the block and I'm just talking to myself and everybody

99
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:23.940
thinks,
oh,
look at that Daddy.

100
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.770
So engaged with this child and I'm really coming up with roast jokes.

101
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:33.490
And then I sat down and I smoked a cigar by myself on my back porch and I just

102
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:40.871
video myself and I just say shit into my fucking then have like 40 videos all

103
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:46.040
like nine,
10 seconds long.
And then I just transcribed them on the plane.

104
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.420
Uh,
most of them now I'm trying to put them into an order where they flow.

105
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.290
And I'm actually writing them down,
but I'm too late for the Tele prompter,

106
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:58.790
so I'm going to have to go up there old school with the fucking pieces of paper

107
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:01.500
up there.
I know people can be like,
boom,

108
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.530
everybody knows just we'll do you put good look over your shoulder dose ever.

109
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.620
It is the teleprompter.
See that the rabbits are already in the hat.
Um,

110
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.260
I never do these roasts things either.
I never do them.

111
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.360
I thought a lot of those comedy central ones,
after a while,

112
00:07:17.361 --> 00:07:20.780
they just went off the rails.
You know what I mean?
It just,

113
00:07:20.781 --> 00:07:24.920
everything was like the fucking,
I dunno.
Everything was so god damn.
Same,

114
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.940
same fucking stupid joke.
You know?
Hey,
I'm not,
yeah,

115
00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.970
<v 5>Shane,
this guide,
beat but doable.
But when he walk away
[inaudible]</v>

116
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.670
<v 1>nine 11,
you know,
whatever the fuck he could say that would</v>

117
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.810
be the most,
you know,
air quote,
Edgy fucking thing,

118
00:07:40.811 --> 00:07:44.530
even though it was totally fucking predictable.
Um,

119
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.330
so,
uh,
yeah,
I never got into those six,

120
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.230
<v 5>you know,
hey,
when you fuck your mother with dodge,
get herpes,</v>

121
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:56.650
you fucking scurvy.

122
00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.100
<v 1>Um,
plus I don't get roasted.</v>

123
00:08:02.101 --> 00:08:07.020
Somebody you don't know like the most jokes I have for the people on this is for

124
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:11.790
Lenny Clarke.
Cause I know Lenny and I love Lenny.
So I've got stories.

125
00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:15.150
I know what he's done.
I got all this stuff I can shit on a,

126
00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.750
I have more shit about letting Clark than I do.

127
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:24.290
You know Greg Koski is a tough one too because everyone's going to go,

128
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:29.280
he's fucking stupid.
So I'm trying to think of another angle.
Um,

129
00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.710
so there really isn't one.
Something about spiking a baby.
I have no idea.

130
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.230
I'm so,
I'm a little amped up for this thing.
A little nervous.

131
00:08:40.231 --> 00:08:43.560
The lamp I can't fuck away to all I know is this just one of these deals which

132
00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:45.480
just like,
just fucking bring me up,

133
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:49.860
bring me up so I can do this thing and then I could relax.

134
00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:55.020
Then I can relax.
That's all I need to do.
I just got to get through.

135
00:08:56.250 --> 00:09:00.120
Just get through tonight,
tonight,
tonight.

136
00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:04.560
Whoa.
Then it's easy.
Then there it's fucking easy.

137
00:09:04.561 --> 00:09:09.060
I go back to my regularly scheduled stand updates,
you know,
God willing,

138
00:09:09.061 --> 00:09:11.400
we'll get a third season of f is for family.

139
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:13.140
I've already been through that shit twice.

140
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:17.130
I'm right back into my company for some,
you know,

141
00:09:17.170 --> 00:09:21.820
so I got here last night and um,
you know,

142
00:09:21.821 --> 00:09:23.950
I carried over to the fucking um,

143
00:09:24.220 --> 00:09:28.690
laugh Boston cause everybody was going over to run their Roche Shit and I didn't

144
00:09:28.691 --> 00:09:32.440
want to do that.
I uh,
I just wanted to do stand up,

145
00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:36.910
just go up there and be funny,
you know,
warm up,
loosen up a little bit.

146
00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:41.800
And then tonight I'll just fucking do the jokes.
That is the game plan.

147
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.750
I'm going to have it printed out nice and fucking big.

148
00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.160
The font is going to be nice and big,

149
00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:49.990
so there's no way for me to fuck these things up.

150
00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:53.920
And I'm just going to go right down the day.
I figure there's like fucking,

151
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:59.620
we got again,
we got Adam Ray,
we had fucking uh,
Susie soliloquy.

152
00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:04.280
We got a Mikey monologue but Doria,
Buh Buh Buh.

153
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:07.120
I like eight or nine fucking,
I do a minute on everybody.
I'm done.

154
00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:11.080
But I got to do David the fucking longest.
So I got,
I got,
you know,

155
00:10:13.330 --> 00:10:15.690
he's actually surprisingly not that hard to row Stephen.

156
00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.200
All the shit that he did,
you know,
you can,

157
00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:19.660
you can get that guy pretty good for dry is difficult.

158
00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:23.020
Why don't you just get past,
you know,
he's just a little fella,
you know.

159
00:10:23.021 --> 00:10:26.560
Then this like,
well now what do I do now for Christ sake?
Who's texting me now?

160
00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:27.663
Huh.

161
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.633
<v 0>Okay.</v>

162
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.550
<v 1>Anyways,
um,
yes.
And then once I get through that,</v>

163
00:10:33.551 --> 00:10:38.380
the rest of the year is downhill,
you know,
down fucking hill,

164
00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:40.750
you know,
and I've already worked it out thinking if I get,

165
00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.650
if we get a third season,
all right,
I'll get up early in the morning,

166
00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:49.790
right.
Spend some time with my daughter and then uh,

167
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.340
I'll go over to the little fucking rehearsal place,
you know,

168
00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:54.710
I'll do my little drum drum drum in there and then I go over,

169
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:59.310
I fucking write this shit.
Then I'm home.
That's the game plan.
Then I get home,

170
00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.420
take the daughter of walk around the block.
Some point,

171
00:11:02.421 --> 00:11:05.360
me and my wife passed each other in the halls were like,
who are you again?
Oh,

172
00:11:05.361 --> 00:11:08.660
that's right.
We're married.
And then that'll be my year.

173
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:15.460
So I'll give you a kiss after the loving

174
00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.720
Engelbert bird.
Humperdinck who fucking,
no.

175
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:30.220
Who Knew?
Um,
can knew that that was going to be in my fucking head today.

176
00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.260
I had no idea.
So anyways,

177
00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:35.860
one of my new hobbies when I'm on the road is,
uh,

178
00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:40.861
I watch Fox News and I watch CNN and I just flipped back and forth between them.

179
00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.190
It is fucking fascinating.
Like,

180
00:11:46.191 --> 00:11:48.560
I don't even know what those channels have become.

181
00:11:48.561 --> 00:11:51.530
I don't know what they ever were,
but it is not news.

182
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:54.550
They're basically yelling at each other now.

183
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.760
That's so fucking,
it's like,
it's like you're watching a sitcom,

184
00:12:02.090 --> 00:12:05.480
you know?
All right,
here's,
here's the idea.
Here's the pitch for the show.

185
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:09.110
This does two news channels once conservative,

186
00:12:09.111 --> 00:12:10.820
and this one's liberal.

187
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.560
I was watching that a Sean Hannity Guy and one of his stories was a story about

188
00:12:18.651 --> 00:12:22.880
somebody on CNN.
You know,
they'll check with the,
uh,

189
00:12:22.881 --> 00:12:26.570
the Mary Lou Retton haircut whenever her fucking name is the one who cried when

190
00:12:26.571 --> 00:12:30.680
Trump got fucking elected,
which really was a low point and journalism

191
00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.220
Hilary lost,
she didn't get assassinated.

192
00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.310
Jesus Christ even fucking what's his face held it together when he said,

193
00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:42.170
JFK got killed.
Fucking Donald Trump gets elected.

194
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.160
You're fucking sitting there blubbering for God's sakes,
woman,

195
00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:50.090
get a hold of yourself.
So anyways,
uh,

196
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.713
<v 6>okay.</v>

197
00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:52.890
<v 1>Um,</v>

198
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:57.890
he fucking was saying he's has her picture up there and it says conspiracy

199
00:12:57.991 --> 00:12:58.824
theory.

200
00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.413
<v 6>MMM.</v>

201
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:03.980
<v 1>Because of whatever the fuck she said.
I don't,
I don't even know.</v>

202
00:13:03.981 --> 00:13:05.090
I'm just sitting there going like,

203
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:09.470
this fucking guy is doing a new story about a news person on another channel.

204
00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:10.520
This is news.

205
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:16.500
When I was growing up,
like,
you know,
I it,

206
00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:20.180
Tom Brokaw was not doing stories about Sam Donaldson.

207
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:25.190
You know,
when only white men gave the news.
No,
I'm kidding.

208
00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:34.400
Um,
I have no idea.
I don't even,
I just don't know what the fuck it is anymore.

209
00:13:34.401 --> 00:13:37.970
But I got to tell you,
it's really entertaining.
You've got to do it.
People,

210
00:13:37.971 --> 00:13:40.520
you got to step out of this fucking liberal conservative thing.

211
00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:44.780
You've got to just step back and just enjoy it for what it is.
Um,

212
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.140
it is just a bunch of people who have just disappeared

213
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.570
and I don't there,
they all need like a fuck.
They all,

214
00:13:53.571 --> 00:13:57.710
every one of them needs to take like two years off.
You know what I mean?

215
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:02.450
And I think they should send them all at first to separate places and then you

216
00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:07.250
gradually get them.
Reacclimated is human beings,
right?

217
00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:09.560
And he just kind of take,
send them to like a camp.

218
00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:14.210
Maybe they start playing a softball game,
but you know,
it's not Fox News for CNN.

219
00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:15.710
You got to mix up the players,

220
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:18.273
<v 6>you know?</v>

221
00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.330
<v 1>I mean,
it'll ruin the rivalry.
Like,
you know,</v>

222
00:14:22.770 --> 00:14:26.460
when the NHL went to Russia to play the Russians and all those fucking,
you know,

223
00:14:26.461 --> 00:14:29.310
the ranges were hanging out with the Bruins and the flyers were hanging out.

224
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.330
Just people started getting drunk together.
Eh,
you know,
you're all right.

225
00:14:33.331 --> 00:14:36.330
You know,
it's kind of ruins it.
But,
um,

226
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.620
Fox News was going off.
You know,
that auto warm be a story,

227
00:14:40.621 --> 00:14:42.300
that fucking horrific fucking story.

228
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.703
<v 6>MMM.</v>

229
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.030
<v 1>You know,
everybody like judging the guy going,
boy,
Yo,</v>

230
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:52.280
what the fuck he take fucking poster for?

231
00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:54.720
<v 6>Uh,</v>

232
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.660
<v 1>it's like anytime there's posters at my shows,
people always take them.</v>

233
00:14:57.661 --> 00:15:00.540
It's the end of the show.
It gives a fuck.
It's something you do,

234
00:15:00.541 --> 00:15:04.260
you grab a little souvenir or whatever.
I mean,
technically it's stealing,

235
00:15:04.261 --> 00:15:05.640
but who gives a fuck?
I mean,
does that,

236
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:09.180
is that enough warranted to give guy 15 years hard labor.

237
00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:13.830
He was there because of our foreign policy,
you know,

238
00:15:14.610 --> 00:15:15.980
that's why they don't like that,

239
00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:20.640
that were this and they're that and we're fucking economic sanctions and all

240
00:15:20.641 --> 00:15:21.930
that shit.
They don't like us.

241
00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:24.803
<v 6>MMM.</v>

242
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.690
<v 1>Like how I just said that to you guys.
Like that's actual news.</v>

243
00:15:27.691 --> 00:15:30.960
So Fox News was doing this thing where they were like,

244
00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.800
they were going back and looking at shit that like some chicks set on Huffington

245
00:15:37.561 --> 00:15:41.490
post and this Larry Wilmore,
what the fuck?

246
00:15:41.491 --> 00:15:45.850
He said when he first did,
he did a bit about like a,
you know,
you know,

247
00:15:45.870 --> 00:15:49.110
call him the frat boy and like basically they didn't have any sympathy for the

248
00:15:49.111 --> 00:15:53.910
guy,
you know,
but now it plays out way weirder because the fucking,

249
00:15:54.940 --> 00:15:59.220
the kid got killed over there,
so they're sitting there,
you know,

250
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.460
the whole fucking thing was just fascinating to watch and like Fox News,

251
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:05.350
it's just like these people are terrible who blah blah blah,
but Dah,
Dah Dah.

252
00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:08.460
You know?
And,
and just taking it kind of like at face value,

253
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.570
not taking into how was written,
why it was written.

254
00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.300
I think everybody's fucked up in it to be honest with you.

255
00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:20.790
I think it's fucked up to do that white privilege thing.
I understand it,

256
00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.190
but the uh,
yeah,

257
00:16:26.191 --> 00:16:28.020
I get that whole thing.
We'll look what he deals with,

258
00:16:28.021 --> 00:16:30.810
we deal with in this country.
It's something you can understand.

259
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:34.950
I am that which I get that point.
But,
uh,

260
00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:41.230
I dunno when you take it to the point of having a little bit of joy about it,

261
00:16:41.231 --> 00:16:45.800
which I probably would if I was on the other side because I am not a,
a,

262
00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:50.410
a mature human being and I am anger issues.

263
00:16:50.411 --> 00:16:52.960
I know that I would probably be coming at it like that too.

264
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:56.170
But it's takes a lot to have empathy.
That's what I've learned.

265
00:16:56.890 --> 00:16:57.640
You know what I mean?

266
00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.820
Cause as much as that chick on the Huffington post was making some good points,

267
00:17:00.850 --> 00:17:03.850
it's like,
well I don't see empathy on your side though.

268
00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:05.650
And I'm not talking about,

269
00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:07.090
<v 0>yeah,</v>

270
00:17:07.090 --> 00:17:10.040
<v 1>towards white people.
It's like,
look at your fucking clothes</v>

271
00:17:12.110 --> 00:17:14.300
is you're saying I'm complicit in your suffering.

272
00:17:14.301 --> 00:17:16.450
What about the people that make you fucking close?

273
00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:19.520
I'll let sweatshop fucking labor.

274
00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:22.490
Do you think about the five year old that's sewed you fucking skirt together?

275
00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:26.280
You don't give a fuck.
You too.
You too busy focused on,

276
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.520
that's what human beings do.
We focus on our shit.

277
00:17:29.521 --> 00:17:32.710
That's what I learned watching CNN when I watched all these fucking white guides

278
00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.680
[inaudible] fucking say this about this other white girl.

279
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.510
They're all up in fucking arms,
the same fucking people,

280
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.230
the same kind of white people that when somebody black gets Chicago,
la,

281
00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.920
just she nose,
just do it to please say you'll be fine,
Duh.
You know,

282
00:17:46.921 --> 00:17:48.960
stop wearing hoodies.
You know,
they just,

283
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.700
and then they just fucking get on with their lives.

284
00:17:50.910 --> 00:17:55.800
Now all of a sudden they're fucking up in arms.
I bought this fucking Dude,

285
00:17:56.750 --> 00:17:57.583
<v 6>you know?</v>

286
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:01.650
<v 1>But that's what people do though.
So I just kinda saw a second.
You know,</v>

287
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:05.730
what you do is you insert yourself into the situation and if you see a white

288
00:18:05.731 --> 00:18:09.270
person and you're white,
you go,
oh my God,
that's terrible.
That could've been me.

289
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:14.890
I think,
you know,
maybe white people,
black people all seem to be sent away,

290
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:17.030
separated at first.
Then we all just,
you know,

291
00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:20.300
kind of mix up and play softball to go right.

292
00:18:20.301 --> 00:18:22.130
But that doesn't work because look at that guy on the eagles.

293
00:18:22.131 --> 00:18:26.060
He went to the country fucking concert and he starts dropping the n word.

294
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.090
You know,
I don't think these robots come and it's going to be a bad thing.

295
00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:37.260
You know?
It'd be weird if could maybe there'll be like improved human beings.

296
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.740
You know,
it'd be fucking weird is if they actually,

297
00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:45.741
they made them so fucking lifelike that they'd be like fucking racist robot,

298
00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.760
you know,
just walking in,
pay pal.
Dot.
Want to work.

299
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.453
<v 6>MMM.</v>

300
00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:02.310
<v 1>A jury of your not peers has fucking convicted.</v>

301
00:19:02.311 --> 00:19:04.110
You know,
I actually just kind of,

302
00:19:04.111 --> 00:19:07.950
I mean the story's kind of like losing momentum,

303
00:19:07.951 --> 00:19:09.240
but if you just watch it,

304
00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:12.720
<v 6>mmm.</v>

305
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.480
<v 1>And you just listen to people too.</v>

306
00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:18.330
They just see the world out there own fucking head and they just talk,

307
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.210
<v 6>uh,</v>

308
00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:23.640
<v 1>I don't think they talk and you just fucking sit there and join it.</v>

309
00:19:24.150 --> 00:19:24.983
<v 6>Like</v>

310
00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.040
<v 1>the people that fucking white dudes on Fox News are the widest.</v>

311
00:19:31.550 --> 00:19:35.330
They look like,
you know,
when they make those coming of age movies in the 80s,

312
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:38.660
and there'd be those fucking a preppy frat boy guys

313
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.960
like you looking at,
I'm going like,
dude,
you seriously dress like that?

314
00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:46.280
<v 6>Okay</v>

315
00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:51.000
<v 1>man.
I guess this is sort of fucking
judging them too,</v>

316
00:19:51.001 --> 00:19:53.970
but like,
uh,
there's one guy on there,
it's just like,
dude,

317
00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:59.030
you look like the date rapists slash your girlfriend died during air quote rough

318
00:20:00.781 --> 00:20:01.614
sex.

319
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:06.510
She was into it and it got carried away that this is what that guy looks like.

320
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:14.370
I Dunno,
the whole fucking thing is just,
it's a weird thing.
But,
uh,

321
00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.330
what I have learned is people,
uh,

322
00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:20.850
the suffering they see as their own suffering and it's very hard to look at

323
00:20:20.851 --> 00:20:24.660
other people's suffering and to try to,
you know,

324
00:20:24.661 --> 00:20:28.010
take time out of your day to understand it regardless of what color you are,

325
00:20:28.110 --> 00:20:33.110
as kind of what I learned from that and the people who actually do are way

326
00:20:34.011 --> 00:20:35.960
beyond me.
And then beyond that,

327
00:20:35.961 --> 00:20:40.010
people who then fucking try to do something about it,

328
00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:42.843
<v 6>you know,</v>

329
00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.410
<v 1>like someone who would actually try to do something about sweatshop labor.
Like,</v>

330
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:49.990
all right,
well,
I'm only gonna buy clothes that are in this country.

331
00:20:49.991 --> 00:20:54.010
I tried to do that for a second and I did that like fucking 15 years ago when

332
00:20:54.011 --> 00:20:56.170
the options were ridiculous.
I was like,

333
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.570
I'm not wearing that out to a comedy club.
I'm going to get destroyed.

334
00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:02.440
So I said to hell with these fucking kids who sewed together my shirts.

335
00:21:02.441 --> 00:21:06.130
I was protecting myself when I was going down to the cellar because I didn't

336
00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:07.030
want to get trashed.

337
00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.500
So I guess I'm saying I'm a selfish piece of shit.

338
00:21:12.501 --> 00:21:14.930
I think that's what I learned watching Fox and CNN.

339
00:21:14.931 --> 00:21:19.310
I think I saw a lot of myself like these guys that just fucking into their own

340
00:21:19.311 --> 00:21:23.090
dealer chicken,
the Huffington Post,
completely 100% into her own fucking deal.

341
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.903
<v 6>You know,</v>

342
00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:30.540
<v 1>the whole fucking world.
The same way with those Fox News guys.</v>

343
00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:34.470
The entire world is the way she sees it.
And those guys,

344
00:21:34.471 --> 00:21:39.300
the entire world is the way that they see it and they just cannot fucking on any

345
00:21:39.330 --> 00:21:42.720
other level fathom.
Any others,
any other reality

346
00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:47.110
<v 6>out there?
You know,</v>

347
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.810
<v 1>I think a lot of times I listened to feminists,</v>

348
00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.030
I just listened to what they say and I just switch around a couple of pronouns

349
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:57.580
from,
from
men.
Do you know he to her.

350
00:21:58.890 --> 00:21:59.270
<v 6>Okay.</v>

351
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:00.890
<v 1>And it's just like you literally,</v>

352
00:22:00.891 --> 00:22:05.540
if I fucking took what you just said and I took out all the men,

353
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.750
I replaced it with women in her and I swear to God,

354
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:13.400
you would sound like a Trump supporter.
All right.
I'm off my fucking soapbox.

355
00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.480
All right.
I was up there for a minute now a Moffett,

356
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.610
and what I'm really trying to say is you got to fucking watch Fox and CNN and

357
00:22:19.611 --> 00:22:21.200
pull yourself out of it.
You know what I mean?

358
00:22:21.201 --> 00:22:24.170
It's like your team got knocked out of the playoffs and you just sit there and

359
00:22:24.171 --> 00:22:29.010
you just watch it.
Yeah.
And just watching these fucking people.
It's not,

360
00:22:29.011 --> 00:22:31.920
none of it is news anymore.
It's just like a,

361
00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.780
I don't,
I don't know what it is.
It's their fucking be opinions.

362
00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:42.460
It's like two op ed channels.
It's like everybody's Andy Rooney,

363
00:22:42.461 --> 00:22:44.950
except there's no humor in it anymore.
They're just fucking,

364
00:22:45.010 --> 00:22:48.850
I guess I'm doing that now on my podcast,
like it's affected make built.
Where's,

365
00:22:48.851 --> 00:22:52.570
where's,
where's the silly jokes?
You know what?

366
00:22:52.571 --> 00:22:56.740
Maybe I'm outta jokes.
I don't have any fucking jokes left.

367
00:22:57.490 --> 00:23:00.010
I so want to read you guys some of these fucking jokes.

368
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.280
I'm going to blame David Ortiz for childhood obesity.

369
00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:10.073
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

370
00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.660
<v 1>There's one for you.
Oh,</v>

371
00:23:14.661 --> 00:23:19.010
the red sox.
Oh yeah.
I got some good shit for them.
Just to general.

372
00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:23.280
I don't have a lot of podria stuff.
Gronk House.
He's hard to cause.

373
00:23:23.281 --> 00:23:26.170
I am going on last and I know everybody's going to be,
eh,

374
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.180
not saying this guy's dumb,
but a puck and woke a worker,

375
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:33.360
Danny Walker Walker.
And then I'd be like,
I fuck,
I can't do that joke.

376
00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.283
Now what do I do?

377
00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:36.483
<v 6>MMM.</v>

378
00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:41.180
<v 1>I don't know.
I'll figure it out.
Worst case scenario,</v>

379
00:23:41.181 --> 00:23:43.220
I bomb and it's over in 10 minutes.
And then what I do,

380
00:23:43.221 --> 00:23:46.510
I just slowly walk out of the fucking room,
you know?
And then,

381
00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:50.530
but I can't drink myself into this stupid,
you know why?
Because all Billie,
no fun

382
00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.540
belly,
no fun.
That's right on and off.
Billy is what I really am.

383
00:23:56.710 --> 00:24:01.440
Since I decided to be Billy.
No Fun.
I've drank Saturday and Sunday,

384
00:24:01.441 --> 00:24:05.910
both weekends and I have not drank Monday through Friday,
so I'm,

385
00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.390
I'm not drinking tonight.

386
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:14.370
That'll be four days in a row and I won't drink tomorrow.
And uh,

387
00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:16.650
then I'll fly back Saturday.
I'm not going to drink that day.

388
00:24:16.651 --> 00:24:19.560
I think I'll be good.
I've got to put a good two weeks fucking run together.

389
00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:24.280
Maybe not quite as the following weekend I'm working with [inaudible].

390
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:26.873
Um,

391
00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:28.373
<v 0>yeah.</v>

392
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.700
<v 1>Who knows?
I don't know,
but I,
I got it.
I got it dialed down though.</v>

393
00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:36.500
I got it back under control.
I like to think,
you know,
cause I said,

394
00:24:36.501 --> 00:24:40.940
so I'm going to Billy Aa.
All right,
we're,
I'm going to give myself a chip.

395
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:46.160
Every five days I get a chip and then I get a drink.
That's how my AA works.

396
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:51.130
You know,
that's the problem with addicts.

397
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:55.330
It's just so all or nothing.
That's why the fucking miserable.

398
00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.010
So I tell you,
did you just have like a glass of wine and just fucking relax?

399
00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:05.050
All right.
Yet gluttonous psychopath.
I'm not a fan of addicts.

400
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.110
I'm really not.
Most.
Some of them are cool,
but in general,

401
00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.640
there's some of the most selfish fucking people you ever going to meet on,
on,

402
00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:13.480
on the face of the fucking earth.

403
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:18.220
And they got that built in fucking excuse.
Uh,
it's not me.

404
00:25:18.221 --> 00:25:23.130
It's the addiction too.
I love South Park.
They're like,
no,

405
00:25:23.131 --> 00:25:26.920
no,
no,
no.
But,
but you did that.
You,
it's not me.
It's the disease.

406
00:25:27.450 --> 00:25:31.660
The fuck out of here
every time it's disease.

407
00:25:31.661 --> 00:25:36.640
It's never you just never you.
Um,

408
00:25:36.670 --> 00:25:38.770
all right.
I think I've said enough stuff to offend people here.

409
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.230
Then I get some fucking emails.
All right,
let's,
uh,

410
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:45.930
let's read a little bit of advertising here.
Um,
five photo club,

411
00:25:46.990 --> 00:25:50.110
uh,
looking good doesn't need to cost a fortune because five,

412
00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:55.111
four club is revolutionizing the way men shop at five photo.

413
00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:59.200
They found a way to make great looking clothes affordable for everyone.

414
00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:02.200
Can they say the name of their fucking entity?
One more time.

415
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.380
Why wasted at the mall or wandering around in the stores?

416
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.890
Each month they send you a curated box.

417
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:12.790
It's one of the most overused fucking words ever curated box.
You know,

418
00:26:12.791 --> 00:26:16.540
like these,
these fucking geniuses staring at shirts.

419
00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:21.370
Yeah.
Give him a couple of stripes in a fucking Polka dot.
Guys.

420
00:26:21.371 --> 00:26:22.204

They don't give a fuck.</v>

460

All they need is white skin,

461
00:28:43.100 --> 00:28:45.930
a little bit of freckles and your fucking hard and that's a guy.
That's a truth.

I think they were actually Nazi hunters are looking in to see who runs that

463
00:28:50.211 --> 00:28:54.560
fucking company.
I'm just saying all right,
but lift,
lift.

464
00:28:54.561 --> 00:28:55.640
These are the nice people.

465
00:28:55.940 --> 00:29:00.590
Live knows that their drivers are what keeps them moving so they do everything

466
00:29:00.591 --> 00:29:04.310
they can to make sure that their drivers are happy on every trip.

467
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.350
Lyft is the ride sharing company that believes in cheating people.

468
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:13.390
It's people better lift believes that being a ride sharing drivers should be fun

469
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:16.670
if you're having a good time,

470
00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:21.230
so the passengers should I be,
I should be wearing sandals.

471
00:29:21.231 --> 00:29:23.870
When I read this sitting fucking in the Lotus position,

472
00:29:24.650 --> 00:29:27.980
lift was f was the first to offer in APP tipping.

473
00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.760
When you drive for Lyft,
Lyft,
you keep 100% of the tips.

474
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.620
Drivers have been paid over 200 million and tips since the feature was

475
00:29:36.621 --> 00:29:41.270
introduced and 170 million of that was spent on yoga classes.

476
00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.600
The rest on Tofu express pay lets drivers get paid almost instantly instead of

477
00:29:46.601 --> 00:29:49.930
waiting weeks.
Lyft has even taken the guesswork out of pickups.

478
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:54.940
The new amp device uses color coded coding to help passengers find their

479
00:29:54.941 --> 00:29:58.810
drivers.
Uh,
you can earn hundreds of dollars a week plus tips.
One,

480
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:03.310
earn more money,
drive more.
It's never been easier to give yourself a race.

481
00:30:03.311 --> 00:30:07.330
It's as simple formula.
Happy drivers means happy passengers.

482
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.340
Maybe that's why nine out of 10 Lyft rides get a perfect five star rating.

Oh,

You gotta have it worked out.

What's something a lot more safer?

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.700
Elevate your underwear game to the next time,
to the next level with me undies.

498
00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.370
You've perfected your wardrobe,
but what about this stuff?

499
00:31:17.371 --> 00:31:18.870
Not everybody gets to see.

500
00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:23.820
We're talking about your balls here and your dick or your clamp.

501
00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:26.520
Whenever you got down there.
Maybe a hermaphrodite.
Maybe you have all three.

502
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:27.680
You know?

503
00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:31.380
Would it be nice if there was something nice and soft up against it of your

504
00:31:31.381 --> 00:31:34.860
choosing?
I'm not talking about taking the subway during rush hour either.

508
00:31:44.131 --> 00:31:48.660

I guess.
Go into the mall can suck,

509
00:31:48.661 --> 00:31:50.400

Especially on black Friday.

510

What's the first thing you put on the last thing you take off?

00:33:03.861 --> 00:33:06.950
is actually informed.
And um,

532
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.620
he was calling somebody out on just fucking doing all these Trump jokes and was

533
00:33:12.621 --> 00:33:14.420
just calling them like a corporate liberal,

534
00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:19.930
just acting as though all of this shit didn't exist during the Obama presidency.

535
00:33:21.741 --> 00:33:25.460
All of these,
you know,
people upside down in houses,

536
00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.430
these never ending fucking wars,
all of this shit.

537
00:33:28.431 --> 00:33:32.900
Everybody gets all amped up about ties.
He says it way better than me.
Um,

538
00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.940
and I forget what,
what,
where he's on,
on the Internet,

539
00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:41.870
but I'm considering moving my operation over there cause youtube is a fucking

540
00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:45.440
rip off.
There are a bunch of goddamn thieves.

541
00:33:46.890 --> 00:33:47.723
<v 6>MMM.</v>

542
00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:50.810
<v 1>I told you the deal over there.
If your video gets flagged,</v>

543
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:55.250
then you don't get the advertising money yet.
They still play the ads.

544
00:33:55.251 --> 00:33:58.370
So it's like,
well who gets the money then?
They try all.
No,
nobody gets it.
Really.

545
00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.750
See they get free ads.

546
00:34:00.020 --> 00:34:03.830
So what's stopping the advertisers from flag and every video they bought time on

547
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.210
that full of Shit.

548
00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:08.043
<v 6>MMM.</v>

549
00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.080
<v 1>So I'm thinking of pulling my channel and putting it somewhere else.</v>

550
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:13.600
I don't know.
I don't know what the fuck did do.
Who knows?
All right.

551
00:34:13.601 --> 00:34:14.860
Simply safe everybody.

552
00:34:14.861 --> 00:34:19.861
You can rest easy when you protect your home and family with simply safe.

553
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:23.470
When you install your simply safe home security system,

554
00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.600
you're arming your home with a powerful,

555
00:34:25.601 --> 00:34:29.470
powerful sensors that tell you if a door opens or a window breaks.

556
00:34:29.890 --> 00:34:34.710
It's a burglar's worst nightmare.
Is it?

557
00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:38.610
I mean,
I think having like,
you know,
I was always thinking,

558
00:34:38.611 --> 00:34:43.320
what if you had like one of the most poisonous snakes in the world,
right?

559
00:34:43.350 --> 00:34:47.250
In the world world world,
right?
And then when you leave at night,

560
00:34:47.251 --> 00:34:50.820
right before you leave,
you fucking,
you let the thing loosen your house.

561
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.610
I'm of course not really thinking this through of like,

562
00:34:53.611 --> 00:34:55.080
eventually I have to come home,

563
00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:59.100
but because I never fantasize pass the person coming in,
you know,

564
00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.640
and the guys like trying to Jimmy the lock and as it's doing it,

565
00:35:02.641 --> 00:35:06.900
that fucking Cobra comes up,
you know,
doing this little fucking,
you know,

566
00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:11.370
dance right?
The snake,
you know,
just waiting for that guy and the guy comes in,

567
00:35:11.371 --> 00:35:15.000
he sneaks in there [inaudible] just fucking bite.
Some

568
00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.690
have a black Mamba in there or some shit.

569
00:35:20.940 --> 00:35:25.710
Then you come home with like your fucking beekeepers' suit on.
Go on here.
Sneaky,

570
00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:27.950
sneaky,
sneaky,
sneaky,
sneaky.
Or you know what?
You can do it.

571
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.900
You just get simply safe.
That would be the worst nightmare.

572
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:36.650
You know what about a Komodo dragon and it just bite your leg and then just

573
00:35:36.651 --> 00:35:39.660
follows you around the house to you fucking start.
Collapse,

574
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.910
starts eating your guts.
Send me that.
That'd be,

575
00:35:41.911 --> 00:35:43.230
I think that would be a worst nightmare.

576
00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:48.930
But evidently simply safe is right up there with Comodo drift.

577
00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:52.320
You can't afford a Komodo dragon or don't have a black Mamba guy.

578
00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.300
Simply safe is what you want.

579
00:35:54.301 --> 00:35:58.890
There's 105 decibels siren that alerts you at the first sign of trouble.

580
00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:03.840
You'll have a dedicated team of security professionals watching over you.

581
00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:08.070
You 24 seven ready to send the police.

582
00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.600
What do you got Kevin Costner?

583
00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:14.130
Is he going to carry me out as I nuzzle into the side of his neck was simply

584
00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.870
safe.
There's no longterm contracts or hidden fees.

585
00:36:18.871 --> 00:36:23.040
And around the clock monitoring is only 1499 a month.

586
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.920
Call to action.
So don't spend another night.

587
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:29.790
Second guessing your home safety gets simply safe and get some rest.

Go to simply safe bird.com.

589
00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:36.210
I'm just picturing when that 105 decibel alarm goes up and you fucking shoot up

590
00:36:36.211 --> 00:36:38.520
in bed with an absolute panic going,

591
00:36:38.521 --> 00:36:42.810
please let that be a squirrel that just bounced off my fucking window.
Um

592
00:36:44.490 --> 00:36:45.323
<v 6>hmm.</v>

593
00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:48.270
<v 1>You know what and why doesn't everybody have a panic room?</v>

594
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.180
Just sleep in that fuck.
Then I'd be of,

595
00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.840
my panic would be that the fucking door wouldn't open up and I'd be in there and

596
00:36:55.841 --> 00:36:59.580
this fucking air tight.
Well,
not airtight,

597
00:36:59.590 --> 00:37:01.180
but soundproof fucking room.

598
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:07.940
Then they had some cheesy headline after I fucking died.
Right.

599
00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.530
Panic room turns into actual panic room.

600
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:18.440
I'm sorry.
That's simply safe.

Is there a reason why they always misspell the words of their company?

603
00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.430
Is that because every website's taken at this point?

Um,
all right.
How much time have I done here?
Ah,

607
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:47.340
37 minutes.
Well,
you know what?

608
00:37:47.341 --> 00:37:49.680
Usually I'd give you a little more fucking freebies here,

609
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:52.050
but I've got to go back to writing,
which I really don't want to do.

610
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.153
<v 6>Uh</v>

611
00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:01.720
<v 1>Oh Jesus.
Well,
you know what?
I guess,
I guess that's what I got to do here.
Uh,
I,</v>

612
00:38:01.721 --> 00:38:04.030
yeah,
I got to sit down and get through this fucking roasting.

613
00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:07.570
I need more shit on Podria.
I need more shit on Gronk.

614
00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.070
I mean,
where do you go?
Where do you go with either one of them?
I get it.

615
00:38:12.071 --> 00:38:15.070
He's little and he's done.
What else is there?

616
00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.860
What the fuck else is there?
Um,
all right.
That's the podcast.

617
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.230
I was just checking it.
I'm just trying to get you home.
Okay.

618
00:38:23.231 --> 00:38:28.090
Now you can listen to some music and uh,
then we'll have,
uh,

619
00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.320
some greatest hits from a podcast going by from the Thursday,
from years ago.

620
00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:35.020
I have no idea what Andrew thumbless is gonna fucking pull,

621
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.550
but he always pulls up some good shit.

622
00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:40.330
I want to thank everybody who said that they had enjoyed listening to mute math.

623
00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:44.080
M u.
T e math,
mute math,
all one word.
They have a new album.

624
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:46.000
You got to check them out.
You got to see him live.

625
00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:47.990
You gotta tell your friends about them.

626
00:38:47.991 --> 00:38:50.650
So you can be the cool person that told them that there's a band called mute

627
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:55.510
math,
that law that exists,
right?
I'm telling you,

628
00:38:55.511 --> 00:38:57.940
as great as your album are,
they've even fucking better life.

629
00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:00.700
Go check them out if you get a chance.
All right?
That's the Thursday afternoon.

630
00:39:00.701 --> 00:39:02.390
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast.
Yeah.

631
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:06.140
<v 0>Have a great weekend.
You can sell it.
You know how the roads goes.
One Monday.</v>

632
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:07.053
All right,
see you.

633
00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.200
[inaudible] [inaudible]
not the fear,

634
00:39:56.130 --> 00:39:57.610
but I can't remember

635
00:40:01.590 --> 00:40:05.260
<v 11>the one on its built bar and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

636
00:40:05.261 --> 00:40:09.610
June 22nd,
2009.
And,
uh,

637
00:40:09.611 --> 00:40:13.570
I'm going to start this podcast by apologizing for not doing a pot,

638
00:40:13.571 --> 00:40:15.790
not only not doing a podcast last week,

639
00:40:15.791 --> 00:40:20.791
but not even giving you guys the decency of sending out a bulletin with some

640
00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:25.090
sort of an explanation.
Um,
I dunno,

641
00:40:25.091 --> 00:40:27.270
I'm in New York right now and,
uh,

642
00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.340
I'm working on this movie thing and it's been raining and it's been a really F

643
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:36.310
it's rained like every fucking day and it's really been affecting the way the

644
00:40:36.311 --> 00:40:40.420
whole shoot things going.
So,
um,
you know,

645
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:45.190
I had a lot of nights where I was walking in at about six in the morning and uh,

646
00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.170
yeah,
it was that.

647
00:40:47.171 --> 00:40:50.200
And then also not to mention my flight didn't have batteries for my fucking

648
00:40:50.201 --> 00:40:53.800
recorder.
You know,
what other excuse do I have?
Oh,

649
00:40:53.801 --> 00:40:58.150
I also did a podcast for 25 minutes last Monday and realized that I didn't even

650
00:40:58.151 --> 00:41:03.100
have the fucking recorder on the dumb fuck that I am.
Yes son,

651
00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.730
Fuck head daddy is.
Um,
yeah.

652
00:41:06.731 --> 00:41:09.670
So I didn't even have the goddamn thing on and I was meeting to buy batteries

653
00:41:09.671 --> 00:41:14.230
and I never did.
And basically I am Douche bag of the week.
How do you like that?

654
00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:19.090
Um,
Douche bag of the week for now,
cause I didn't do a podcast.
You know,

655
00:41:19.150 --> 00:41:21.010
we all miss days at work.
Hell,

656
00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.160
a rod miss two days in a row because he was a little fatigued.

657
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:28.420
He did was a little fatigued.
You know,
you make 200 fucking million dollars.

658
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:31.450
You missed the first two months of this season cause you hips fucked up.

659
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.710
Cause I don't know what,
get fucking stuck the needle in too far.
You know.

660
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.160
Oh Jesus,
that was a cheap shot.
I'll tell you guys right now.
Um,

661
00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:44.450
as far as baseball goes,
um,
I'm already getting,

662
00:41:44.451 --> 00:41:48.650
I'm getting into golf and uh,
I'm preparing myself.

663
00:41:49.340 --> 00:41:54.340
If one more fucking guy that I loved test positive for steroids.

664
00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.570
Um,
there's one dude in particular,
if,
if he,
if they ever name his name,

665
00:41:59.870 --> 00:42:03.710
I am done with fucking baseball.
I'm not going to say who it is out of respect.

666
00:42:03.711 --> 00:42:07.910
Most of you can probably guess who,
but uh,
I'm going to be done with the sport,

667
00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.590
so this is what I figure,
I figure basketball and hockey go,

668
00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:15.620
you know,
they go all the way into like the second week of June.

669
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:21.190
So then all I gotta do is I just got to kill the last two weeks of June and the

670
00:42:22.071 --> 00:42:26.240
fucking in the four weeks of July,
that's all I have to kill.

671
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:28.440
And then,
then it's going to be preseason.

672
00:42:28.460 --> 00:42:32.510
Even then they got the hall of fame game,
right?
They got the hall of fame game.

673
00:42:32.511 --> 00:42:36.560
I think that's one is in July and then I'm good and I don't have to deal with

674
00:42:36.561 --> 00:42:41.030
baseball anymore because I can't,
I can't fucking take it anymore,
you know,

675
00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:44.390
and believe me,
I don't believe in Santa Clause.
I'm not like a fucking idiot.

676
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:48.710
But you know,
Sammy Sosa test positive.

677
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:51.350
What do you think about Sammy Sosa?
I mean,
I mean,

678
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.420
I think Barry bonds belongs in the hall of fame because of what the fuck he did

679
00:42:56.780 --> 00:42:59.960
before he became this roided out monster.
I mean,
the guy was,

680
00:42:59.961 --> 00:43:04.220
he was always a beast.
Then he turned into the hulk.
You know what I mean?

681
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.710
So I mean,

682
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:11.030
whatever he say he's better than Babe Ruth.

683
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:14.450
I wouldn't say that because Babe Ruth,
you know,
wasn't on juice.

684
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.090
But why wasn't Babe Ruth on juice?
You know why?

685
00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:18.830
Because it didn't have any juice back then.

686
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:22.970
That guy was on the fucking sauce and he was eating fried chicken and he was

687
00:43:22.971 --> 00:43:25.970
date rape and chicks on a fucking train on the way down to Baltimore.

688
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.970
That's what I read.
You know,
he's in the hall of fame.

689
00:43:28.971 --> 00:43:33.590
So why not Barry bonds and his huge fucking HGH head,

690
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:36.920
why can't he get in?
But Sammy Sosa,
this is why I say no to that guy,

691
00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:41.360
because that mother fucker was,
he wasn't anybody.

692
00:43:41.930 --> 00:43:44.390
And then all of a sudden he was somebody and then he was gone again.

693
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:49.370
And not only did he do roids,
he got caught with a fucking cork bat.
Okay,

694
00:43:49.371 --> 00:43:51.980
what the fuck else do you need?
You know,

695
00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:56.300
what else do you fucking need at that point?

696
00:43:57.290 --> 00:44:00.860
Have your best friend fucking get on the mound and under hand the ball to you.

697
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:05.000
And that guy hit,
he get like,
what?
606 home runs?

698
00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:09.380
I think he hit like fucking 560 of them in a year and a half.

699
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:13.970
Baseball has been Betty.
Betty,
good to meet Ya.
Shut up stupid.

700
00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.690
You're going to needle sticking out of your shirt pocket.
Um,
yeah.

701
00:44:17.691 --> 00:44:19.700
So I think I'm going to be,
I'm going to be done.

702
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.830
I'm going to be done with baseball.
I'm be fucking,
I be done with it.

703
00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:28.220
One More fucking guy that I love.
Test positive,
you know,

704
00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:29.900
cause you know what you do.
I don't know about you guys,

705
00:44:29.901 --> 00:44:34.901
but I go back to to when I was chairing the player on and getting all excited

706
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.310
and you just feel fucking stupid.
You know,

707
00:44:39.150 --> 00:44:43.410
I remember in 1998 who the fuck was watching baseball.

708
00:44:43.411 --> 00:44:47.250
Baseball was finished.
They still hadn't recovered from the strike.

709
00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:51.020
The only thing that was good that was going on was cal Ripkin broke Lou Gehrig's

710
00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:55.950
streak and then all of a sudden McGuire and socio having this home run fucking

711
00:44:56.580 --> 00:45:00.510
contest.
And I sat there like some depression.
Eric fucking kid,

712
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:06.300
boy,
oh boy,
golly GED.
Just see that one go.
Well with offense.

713
00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:13.380
I fucking scalped the ticket to go watch Mark McGuire hit his 28th home run

714
00:45:13.381 --> 00:45:17.310
against the San Diego Padres as they say up in Boston.

715
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.960
I'm
fucking,
I I,
you know,

716
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.030
sat in the upper deck and left field.

717
00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:28.140
I watched him take batting practice was actually pretty funny cause at that

718
00:45:28.141 --> 00:45:31.800
point he was such a fucking rockstar because he'd already come close to year

719
00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:35.490
before.
This dude was such a fucking rock star that half the stadium was full.

720
00:45:35.610 --> 00:45:37.650
Just to watch him was,

721
00:45:37.651 --> 00:45:41.940
was just to watch this guy take batting practice and he came up to the plate and

722
00:45:41.941 --> 00:45:45.570
he got a standing ovation like an hour before the game.
See,

723
00:45:45.571 --> 00:45:48.840
everybody's waiting for him to fucking crush one over the wall and I'll never

724
00:45:48.841 --> 00:45:49.351
forget this.

725
00:45:49.351 --> 00:45:53.400
They pitched the first practice pitch in and he laid down a bunt and everybody

726
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:57.840
laughed and some idiots booed because,
uh,
because they're morons,

727
00:45:58.770 --> 00:45:59.220
you know,

728
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.490
those are the same people who would just stand back then they were just standing

729
00:46:02.491 --> 00:46:05.790
around cause there was no youtube that they could sit there and fucking write

730
00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.960
their dumb ass comments on.
So anyways,
Jesus Christ,
you know what,

731
00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:12.900
if you're not into sports,
she definitely not listening to this fucking podcast.

732
00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:16.170
Uh,
I got to have a couple of congratulations out there.

733
00:46:16.171 --> 00:46:20.460
I gotta congratulate the fucking Los Angeles Lakers.
Jesus Christ.

734
00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:21.541
I've got to admit,

735
00:46:21.541 --> 00:46:26.541
I did not watch one second of the celebration I a or the last game I just was

736
00:46:28.081 --> 00:46:30.810
sort of flipping in once I saw they were like up by 15.
I was like that.

737
00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:34.050
How those motherfuckers,
and then,
uh,
you know,

738
00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:38.640
and then ESPN comes on says that they have 15 championships and only two behind

739
00:46:38.641 --> 00:46:42.990
the Celtics and a,
which is true.
But I also know every moron,

740
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:47.880
La Laker fan thinks that the Los Angeles Lakers have 15 titles when they don't,

741
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:49.920
they have fucking 10.
Okay.

742
00:46:50.100 --> 00:46:54.000
And I believe that the fucking titles belonged to the fence.
Okay.

743
00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:58.830
What the fuck did the people in Minnesota celebrate?
Nothing.
Those aren't,
there's

744
00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:03.420
Ah,
God,
I'm in such a country fucking mood.
I just got,

745
00:47:03.421 --> 00:47:06.690
I got to do this podcast though because I know I'm going to sleep till fucking

746
00:47:06.691 --> 00:47:11.640
one tomorrow.
My,
my whole fucking sleep pattern is just out of whack.
Um,

747
00:47:11.641 --> 00:47:13.410
so anyways,
if you knew to my podcast,

748
00:47:13.411 --> 00:47:16.110
I do one of these motherfuckers every week unless,
uh,

749
00:47:17.130 --> 00:47:20.940
unless some fucking staying out until six in the morning and it's raining every

750
00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:25.860
night.
So,
um,
let's get on with the questions here.
The question for the week.

751
00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.900
All right,
this person says,
Bill,

752
00:47:27.901 --> 00:47:32.901
I recently read something online about Michael Vick negotiating a spokesman deal

753
00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.700
for Peter.
Since you now have your dark,

754
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:40.750
how fucking stupid is that?
You know,

755
00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:44.050
like anybody's going to believe that Michael Vick gives a shit about dogs.

756
00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.400
That's like when,
when like,

757
00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:50.460
like Vince Neil fucking gets busted for drinking and driving and somebody dies

758
00:47:51.101 --> 00:47:54.760
in the car and then like three weeks later he's like,
hey,
this is Vince Neil.

759
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:57.640
You know,
when you're out partying it up,

760
00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.330
just make sure you got a designated driver.
You know,

761
00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:04.240
I never understood that.
It's like,
dude,

762
00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:09.390
where the fuck do you get off telling me what the fuck I should do before I get

763
00:48:09.731 --> 00:48:12.040
behind the fucking wheel?
Huh?

764
00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:16.690
You fucking cunt.
Um,

765
00:48:18.590 --> 00:48:21.490
you know what I mean?
So Michael Vick is going to be a spokes.

766
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:24.790
I don't understand people at Peta.

767
00:48:24.791 --> 00:48:29.440
What are they trying to just embarrass the guy?
Is that what they're doing?
Like,

768
00:48:29.441 --> 00:48:31.330
yeah,
listen,
we got so much power.

769
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:35.470
We're going to make this guy come on TV and act like he gives a shit about dogs

770
00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:36.880
when he clearly doesn't.

771
00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.710
That doesn't make any fucking sense when you really think about it.
Right.

772
00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:43.150
That's like a,

773
00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:48.220
that'd be like as some woman's group having a convicted rapist go on and be
like,

774
00:48:48.221 --> 00:48:52.360
you know,
you,
you really got to respect these broads.
They,
uh,
you know,

775
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:57.190
they work hard.
They,
uh,
they'll,
they'll make you a sandwich and a,
sorry,

776
00:48:57.191 --> 00:48:58.024
I'm riffing.

777
00:49:02.710 --> 00:49:05.860
Um,
that was supposed to be the rapist saying to the ladies,
going,
sorry,

778
00:49:05.861 --> 00:49:08.200
I'm riffing in the ladies who supposed to be yelling.

779
00:49:08.230 --> 00:49:11.680
There's nothing about making a sandwich in that statement.
You know,

780
00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:15.460
if you didn't get it,
I'm really not good at that type of shit.
All right,
let's,

781
00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:20.270
let's plow through this question.
Um,
all right.
Uh,

782
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:24.220
we're gonna have terrorists fucking give a 4th of July tips in the next couple

783
00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.690
of weeks.
Oh my God.
I was really,

784
00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:31.760
I was literally ready to go into some hacky fucking Middle Eastern accent,

785
00:49:32.231 --> 00:49:36.040
which is really some,
just me imitating somebody else doing an Indian accent,

786
00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.660
somebody from India,
you know,
make sure you don't boot.
They fired Craig.

787
00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:45.610
I was literally going to do that and I stopped myself because just out of

788
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:49.720
fucking respect for myself and you guys as the listeners,
okay.

789
00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:53.620
I swear to God,
if I actually did that at like,

790
00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:58.090
and you guys actually came back next week and listen to the podcast,
you know,

791
00:49:58.150 --> 00:50:01.870
I would lose all respect for you.
All right,
let's finish this question.
All right.

792
00:50:01.871 --> 00:50:04.870
I recently read something about a online,
about Michael Vick,

793
00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.180
a negotiating a spokesman deal for Peter.
Uh,

794
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:12.580
since you now have your dog,
uh,
what do you think about this?

795
00:50:12.581 --> 00:50:15.920
I think I just answered that.
I personally hate the fucker sense.

796
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:18.400
It's people like him that would leave a dog by,

797
00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:21.940
by the bridge or worse after they're done fighting them.

798
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:26.950
Not to mention this is just a ploy to get back on the public's good side.

799
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.680
He can work his way into playing football again.
Also,

800
00:50:30.681 --> 00:50:35.670
since you're now doing the podcast,
uh,
wait,
let me just address that quite,

801
00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.150
you know,
so he can,
uh,

802
00:50:38.151 --> 00:50:42.080
it's just a ploy so we can get back and pub on the public's good side so he can

803
00:50:42.081 --> 00:50:45.530
play football again.
Let me ask all you animal lovers out there.

804
00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:50.480
Don't you think Michael has paid his debt to society?
I mean,

805
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:54.110
what the fuck else does this guy have to do?

806
00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:58.670
His dream was to play professional football.
It got taken away.

807
00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:03.410
He had millions of dollars.
He's fucking,
he has nothing left.
They took his house,

808
00:51:03.411 --> 00:51:04.700
they took his mom's house.

809
00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:08.540
The guy did time for fucking with dogs.

810
00:51:08.541 --> 00:51:12.080
He went to Leavenworth,
Leavenworth,

811
00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:16.010
Sammy the bull didn't go to fucking 11 worth.
He went right.
I'm just,

812
00:51:16.011 --> 00:51:18.520
I just literally just said that.
I have no idea if he went there and I,

813
00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.260
that's one of those bar room fucking things you,

814
00:51:21.350 --> 00:51:25.010
that's something you say in a bar when no one can fucking do the research.

815
00:51:25.011 --> 00:51:26.900
I guess they can now in their blackberries,
you know,

816
00:51:26.930 --> 00:51:28.320
but you guys are all at your computers.

817
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:31.760
I'm sure everybody's clicking courses and your fucking keyboards.

818
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.790
But you know what I mean?
The guy went to fucking Leavenworth.

819
00:51:34.910 --> 00:51:38.210
He was the quarterback of the Atlanta Falcons.
He was one of the,

820
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:39.980
he was on his way.
They were talking,

821
00:51:39.981 --> 00:51:42.230
laughing like he was the Michael Next Michael Jordan.

822
00:51:42.650 --> 00:51:46.970
But he's playing fucking football.
All right.
And what does he do?

823
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:51.530
We asked some dog fights.
People flip the fuck out.
Right?

824
00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:55.700
I'm not saying what he did,
what he did wasn't fucking,
it was bizarre.

825
00:51:55.730 --> 00:51:59.740
What he did was fucking bizarre.
Cause I,
I,
I don't know that I,

826
00:51:59.750 --> 00:52:03.080
I'd heard a dog fights,
but I,
I just thought that was like some,
uh,

827
00:52:03.081 --> 00:52:07.520
gangs in New York.
Shit.
I didn't know people still did that stuff.
But anyways,

828
00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.910
I mean,
he lost everything.
The guy lost everything.

829
00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.540
You lost two fucking years of playing.
He,

830
00:52:14.550 --> 00:52:18.020
the guy lost everything and he went to fucking Leavenworth.

831
00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:24.720
Jesus fucking Christ.
It's,

832
00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.930
you know,
fuck you peed off.
Go Fuck Yourself.

833
00:52:28.931 --> 00:52:32.020
I'm not doing your Goddamn fucking announcement.
All right.

834
00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:35.740
I spent the last two years try not to get raped.
I lost all my fucking money.

835
00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:39.640
I lost my fucking career and I'll probably gonna sign with the fucking Detroit

836
00:52:39.641 --> 00:52:43.000
lions.
Isn't that enough for you?
Cons.
You fucking Weirdos.

837
00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:45.940
Why don't you go yell at Obama for fucking slap in a house?

838
00:52:45.941 --> 00:52:47.710
Fly like you've never done that.

839
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:54.990
Can you fucking believe Obama got shit for it's a fucking house with lands on

840
00:52:55.871 --> 00:53:00.850
Shit.
Get it off me.
You know.
How about a mosquito?

841
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:05.560
Would people at Peta flip out about a fucking mosquito?
You know,

842
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:10.630
Datto six carry diseases,
it dumped.
Oh,
speaking of that swine Flus back,
Huh?

843
00:53:12.100 --> 00:53:12.960
Good old swine flu.

844
00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.730
You've got to love swine flu as long as you don't get it and nobody loves gets

845
00:53:15.731 --> 00:53:18.970
it.
I'm telling you this,
you know,
there's good things,
you know,

846
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:23.480
thin out the traffic,
you know,
let's get some,
uh,

847
00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:24.720
how the fuck did swab.

848
00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:29.220
I was doing a bit about that and maybe I can bring that back about how anytime a

849
00:53:29.221 --> 00:53:33.800
new disease comes out,
like it can't just be like,
you know,

850
00:53:33.801 --> 00:53:36.380
someone was in the forest and they get bit by something.

851
00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:41.090
It always has to be somebody fucked an animal,
you know,

852
00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:45.480
aids.
Some dude,
somebody fucked on monkey,
you know,

853
00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:49.580
they fucked a monkey and then they got on the Concorde and they blew a

854
00:53:49.581 --> 00:53:50.480
stewardess.

855
00:53:51.470 --> 00:53:55.670
Add a m or a male stewardess and then there was aids.

856
00:53:57.110 --> 00:54:00.920
Oh yeah,
yeah.
I'm telling you yellow fever,
dude,

857
00:54:00.921 --> 00:54:05.300
somebody fucked the fucking car,
dude.
Really,

858
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:11.720
really swine flu.
I'm telling you dude,
down in Mexico,
they fucking,

859
00:54:11.721 --> 00:54:13.610
if they fuck pigs down there,
you know,

860
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.540
don't see anybody fucking picks up here to you.
Shut up.

861
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:21.140
Everybody comes a goddamn doctor.
Um,

862
00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:26.530
I don't know.
Where do diseases come from?
I think they actually,
uh,

863
00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:30.880
I dunno,
I was actually gonna say that he'd done,

864
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.370
do you think that there will be fucking,
I think they would be,

865
00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.940
but would you think this,
would you think that they would be evil enough?

866
00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:39.791
Sorry,

867
00:54:39.791 --> 00:54:42.400
I was just making sure there's fucking thanks recording because this happened to

868
00:54:42.401 --> 00:54:44.800
me last week.
I talked for 25 minutes and it didn't,

869
00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:48.910
do you think that they would actually be fucking evil enough to actually just

870
00:54:48.911 --> 00:54:52.310
create a disease?
You know,
I do.

871
00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:58.700
And then actually think that they could somehow control it and um,

872
00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:03.240
I dunno man.
You get why something has to be done.

873
00:55:03.241 --> 00:55:07.770
There's just too many fucking people.
I've said this before,

874
00:55:07.771 --> 00:55:10.020
I swear to God,
I'm 41 I don't have any kids.

875
00:55:10.021 --> 00:55:13.980
I really think I should be getting a tax break for not adding to the traffic.

876
00:55:14.790 --> 00:55:15.623
You know,

877
00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.070
I think everybody should be required to wait till their forties to have kids.

878
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:24.540
Let some old people die,
let some accidents happen,
you know,

879
00:55:25.080 --> 00:55:30.080
let some fucking people die so we don't have to fucking have 19 lane highways.

880
00:55:31.170 --> 00:55:32.003
You know,

881
00:55:34.150 --> 00:55:38.830
maybe it's good that people are fucking pigs.
I don't know if in the end of it,

882
00:55:38.831 --> 00:55:42.130
some people fucking die and then they don't have eight kids and made him,

883
00:55:42.131 --> 00:55:46.120
you know,
does anything I say makes sense.

884
00:55:46.121 --> 00:55:48.460
It's just so fucking stupid sometimes.
So anyways,

885
00:55:48.461 --> 00:55:50.860
let me finish with this question here.
Um,

886
00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:55.330
also since you're now doing the podcast and your new microphone system,

887
00:55:55.810 --> 00:56:00.100
will we get a chance to hear any more of you on the road or in an airport?

888
00:56:00.101 --> 00:56:03.010
I found those to be hilarious and like the sound better.

889
00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:07.990
Don't know why the new ones are too quiet.
Uh,

890
00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.660
but still free.
So I probably shouldn't be complaining.

891
00:56:10.661 --> 00:56:13.190
Hope to see you on stage soon.
They would.
I don't know.

892
00:56:13.191 --> 00:56:15.730
I Dunno what the deal is with that.
Maybe.
I,
I think,
uh,

893
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:18.190
last weeks was too quiet because I had a problem.

894
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:20.890
I didn't adjust the device correctly.
I'm on the road.

895
00:56:20.891 --> 00:56:25.570
I don't have the microphone and uh,
you know,
I'm on the talent end here.

896
00:56:25.571 --> 00:56:30.400
I'm not on the fucking,
I'm not the guy in the studio.
I'm not Bob Rock here.
Okay.

897
00:56:30.401 --> 00:56:34.820
So sometimes they might be a little fucked up,
but um,
yeah,

898
00:56:34.821 --> 00:56:37.840
I know a lot of people like those old podcasts where I used to just go off on

899
00:56:37.841 --> 00:56:42.310
people in airports.
Um,
I dunno.

900
00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:43.330
I guess I could do it,

901
00:56:43.331 --> 00:56:45.670
but it was always easier to do it on my phone cause people,

902
00:56:45.700 --> 00:56:47.290
they have no idea I was talking to him.

903
00:56:47.291 --> 00:56:50.470
But if I sit here with this fucking device,
you know,

904
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:55.300
God knows some will will take some nine 11 statute and I'll be in some goddamn

905
00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.280
back room.
Um,
all right,
let's get to overrate.
Underrated.
Okay.
Overrated.

906
00:57:00.281 --> 00:57:04.100
Underrated for this week.
All right.
Overrated people who make those,
uh,

907
00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:08.230
that moves me.
Emotional grunts during public performances.

908
00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:11.950
Uh,
Jesus,
isn't that,
yeah.
Isn't that the fucking truth?

909
00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:16.980
If you're listening to a firsthand story about saving a person's life perhaps,

910
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:20.920
but making a noise across between almond lighting,

911
00:57:20.980 --> 00:57:25.870
I'm enlightened and I have a stomach pain in response to a trivial fact gets old

912
00:57:25.871 --> 00:57:30.610
quick.
Yeah,
I absolutely have to fucking agree with that one.

913
00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:32.230
Another one.
Overrated.

914
00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:36.760
This is one that's going to fucking definitely get some feedback.

915
00:57:36.761 --> 00:57:39.730
Somebody says public school teachers are overrated.

916
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:41.800
They only work nine months a year,

917
00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:46.510
get paid a living wages with full benefits and pensions and they have a

918
00:57:46.511 --> 00:57:51.310
ridiculously easy job.
I'm going to pause.
There was all the,
any,

919
00:57:51.311 --> 00:57:52.810
if I have any teachers who are listening,

920
00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.400
they're just teaching the same shit over and over again every year and they for

921
00:57:57.401 --> 00:58:01.960
the most part suck at it.
Wow.
Calculus aside,

922
00:58:01.961 --> 00:58:03.940
most of the shit is really simple.

923
00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:08.950
Like how hard is it to teach kids how to spell the word tree every year?

924
00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:13.540
It's not like the Boston tea party gains a new level of nuance every year.

925
00:58:13.541 --> 00:58:18.040
You teach it yet they complain.
We're underpaid,
we're underappreciated.

926
00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.113
But Shit,

927
00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:23.620
you're overpaid for working a semi part time job that you mostly suck at.

928
00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:28.540
You're given a free pass to the middle of class and somehow the bonus of a

929
00:58:28.541 --> 00:58:33.430
social martyrdom.
I know,
I didn't say that right.
People are always bitching.
Oh,

930
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:37.120
we need more teachers,
Dude,
our school teachers,
Middle Middleclass.
What do you,

931
00:58:37.121 --> 00:58:41.110
what do you consider middleclass 25 grand a year.
Whatever the fuck they pay.

932
00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.020
Um,
those poor things,

933
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:47.380
living off of government money and having to explain really simple shit.

934
00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.730
The children,
not an easy job like working minimum wage,
hauling debris,

935
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:56.410
working the fields are cleaning bathrooms in comm,
convalescent homes.

936
00:58:56.650 --> 00:59:01.480
Stupid fucking lazy coal miners.
They don't contribute to society like we do.

937
00:59:01.481 --> 00:59:05.860
I guess this is the teacher's talking.
We hope we help mold young minds.

938
00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.300
Great job.
That's why most people are fucking morons.
All right?

939
00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.710
All right dude.
You know,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm gonna fucking way on this one.

940
00:59:14.711 --> 00:59:18.100
I think what you're doing is you're blaming the ass of the problem.

941
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:23.060
All right.
Do,
would you want to stand there in front of 30 snot nosed kids,

942
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:28.600
18 of which probably have to dumb fuck who didn't wear a fucking condom for

943
00:59:29.151 --> 00:59:31.010
parents,
you know,

944
00:59:31.820 --> 00:59:35.750
and you've got to get there with their fucking Brat kid and all these fucking

945
00:59:35.751 --> 00:59:40.460
parents,
no parent today can admit that their kid is a Douche bag,

946
00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:43.880
you know,
not overall.
No parent would admit that.
But you know what I mean?

947
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:48.230
Like in a certain situation,
they always gotta fucking excuse.
They got add.

948
00:59:48.410 --> 00:59:52.940
The teachers,
uh,
was doing this.
So they were doing that,
you know,

949
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:57.230
I do.
Do you want to be a fucking day?
It's such a fucking great job,
dude.

950
00:59:57.231 --> 00:59:59.900
You go be a goddamn teacher.
I know what you mean,
dude.

951
01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.000
Nine months a year is to shit.
And you get the whole,

952
01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:06.440
like their vacation days are ridiculous.
That is a great point.
Think about that.

953
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:10.070
They get all those Jewish holidays off,
they get the PTA thing off,

954
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:13.900
they get the fucking Thanksgiving week off.
They get like a,

955
01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:18.890
like 10 day vacation for 10 days vacation over Christmas,
February vacation,

956
01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.340
April vacation and summer vacation.
You know,

957
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:25.670
and you do come in from nine to three.
And I got to admit,

958
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:29.300
even if you are teaching calculus,
once you do it for a number of years,

959
01:00:29.650 --> 01:00:34.100
you got it down.
But you know what,
you can say that about everybody.
You know

960
01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.450
the fuck.
Let me tell you know,

961
01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.440
how many basements do you have to refinish before you got it down?
Well,

962
01:00:42.441 --> 01:00:46.640
you know what you gotta do,
you know,
I don't know.

963
01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:50.840
And I,
I think,
uh,
and,
and any time we get into shit,

964
01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:53.750
the first thing they cut is they always cut education.

965
01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:58.100
They always kind of education and can people have old fucking books.
I Dunno,

966
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.963
you know,
something.

967
01:00:59.100 --> 01:01:02.860
Talk to some of the people here in New York and some of the shifts that they got

968
01:01:02.861 --> 01:01:06.860
to deal with in some of the public schools,
you know,
and no matter what they do,

969
01:01:06.861 --> 01:01:11.700
the kids never fucking wrong,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
Um,
I will,

970
01:01:11.701 --> 01:01:12.620
I,
I'll tell you this,

971
01:01:12.621 --> 01:01:17.621
I do totally agree with their hours are ridiculous and the amount of vacation

972
01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:21.680
time that they get is ridiculous.
But I gotta be honest with you,
dude,

973
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.090
think about flying,

974
01:01:23.091 --> 01:01:26.960
getting on an airplane and there's that fucking screaming kid.
All right?

975
01:01:26.961 --> 01:01:31.190
Now multiply that times 30 and you've got to spend six fucking hours.

976
01:01:31.850 --> 01:01:34.640
At least when you're on the Goddamn plane,
you can ignore the kid.

977
01:01:34.641 --> 01:01:37.040
You can put on a Walkman.
You can't do that as a teacher.

978
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:40.850
You've got to actually somehow get these kids to shut the fuck up and then teach

979
01:01:40.851 --> 01:01:43.400
them how to spell the word tree.
You know,

980
01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:49.530
fuck that you can have that job.
Um,
all right.

981
01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:53.390
Actually thought about being a teacher for awhile before I did stand up.

982
01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:57.740
You know,
I just wanted to somehow be in front of a group of people and be funny.

983
01:01:58.070 --> 01:02:01.360
And I remember every job I thought about Ibi be funny,
I'll be a cup,

984
01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.850
but I'll be a funny carp.
I'll pull people over and I'll let them go.
You know,

985
01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.200
that's what I used to think.
You know,

986
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.530
I'd be one of those guys who gets shocked during the second fucking week cause

987
01:02:09.531 --> 01:02:13.940
I'm trying to make friends,
you know,
with my pathetic need to be liked.

988
01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:19.110
All right,
let's get into the bad press thing.
A few weeks ago I mentioned how,
uh,

989
01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:23.160
you know,
there's certain groups of people that just always get good press.

990
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:26.790
You know,
firemen always get good press.
The,
uh,

991
01:02:26.791 --> 01:02:30.250
the men and women in the armed services always get good press and Bob,

992
01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:34.530
and for the most part,
99% of it is right.
All right.

993
01:02:34.531 --> 01:02:39.531
But if you saw Jurassic Park and you'll listen to Jeff Goldbloom explained chaos

994
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:43.110
theory,
there's exceptions,
you know,

995
01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.180
there's no way,
there's not one douche bag in the navy.
There's no way.

996
01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.630
There's not one asshole at the fire department.
You know,
there are.

997
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:56.780
So I wanted to hear the stories and here's one bill is about an army guy.

998
01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:00.150
Bill,
I have a story about an old neighbor of mine who was in the army.

999
01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:04.260
Most people in the army never seem to have anything negative said about them,

1000
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:06.030
but that's not the case with me.

1001
01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:10.590
I used to live next to a family in which there were six sons and each of them

1002
01:03:10.591 --> 01:03:12.030
were real pieces of shit.

1003
01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.920
That's hilarious.
Isn't there always just that fucking piece of shit?

1004
01:03:18.921 --> 01:03:23.720
Scumbag family,
you know,
every fucking one of them is a p.

1005
01:03:23.721 --> 01:03:28.550
The Dad's a piece of shit.
The mothers of piece of Shit.
All the sons,

1006
01:03:28.551 --> 01:03:32.510
all the daughters that dog their car,
that it's just a,

1007
01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:37.190
from head from top to bottom.
It's just a piece of shit.
Fucking family,
right?

1008
01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:42.260
They all sit there and breathe in through their mouth.
All right.
Anyways.
Um,

1009
01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.570
so he goes,
yeah,
they're all pieces of shit.
He goes,

1010
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:48.770
I'm talking about the types of assholes who would drop a hit of acid in

1011
01:03:49.250 --> 01:03:52.490
someone's beer and get a kick out of watching the person trip his ass off.

1012
01:03:52.820 --> 01:03:55.430
Every one of them was arrested at least once.

1013
01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:58.970
The oldest was the biggest piece of shit out of the bunch.

1014
01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:03.050
He shot a liquor store clerk and I think he paralyzed the guy from the waist

1015
01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:04.700
down.
But out of all of them,

1016
01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:08.930
there was one who considered himself to be the prize.
Why you ask?

1017
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.370
Because he was the one who was in the army and whenever this guy would come back

1018
01:04:13.371 --> 01:04:17.900
home to visit,
he would bring in quotes,
army toys with him.

1019
01:04:20.830 --> 01:04:21.663
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

1020
01:04:21.870 --> 01:04:26.640
<v 11>This is a great fucking story.
Um,
there are a few stories that I remember.</v>

1021
01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:31.410
One time he had a smokescreen and set it off in a neighbor's yard.

1022
01:04:32.820 --> 01:04:33.653
Uh,
there were,

1023
01:04:33.810 --> 01:04:37.590
there were these blue flames shooting out the back and just burn it up the
grass.

1024
01:04:37.591 --> 01:04:42.060
And in a matter of five seconds you couldn't see any of the houses on the
street.

1025
01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:45.420
Another time he set off a flare in the middle of the night.

1026
01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.760
I can still see him setting the thing off.

1027
01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.100
He just smacked the end of it on the pavement.

1028
01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:54.060
Out came this little ball of light that shot up in the sky and then poof,

1029
01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:59.040
it was daylight out.
He woke up half the neighborhood.
Uh,

1030
01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:03.150
but the worst ever was when he was home for Thanksgiving and I saw him out at a

1031
01:05:03.151 --> 01:05:03.571
bar.

1032
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:07.650
He had brought home a fucking hand grenade and was trying to sell the fucking

1033
01:05:07.651 --> 01:05:10.800
thing.
One last thing about this family,

1034
01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.820
they had a retarded brother who was a fucking monster,

1035
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:16.680
like 250 pounds.

1036
01:05:16.930 --> 01:05:20.890
All I did with this brother was basically keep them locked up in a room and let

1037
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:25.270
them watch pro wrestling one year at the 4th of July block party.

1038
01:05:25.450 --> 01:05:28.750
They thought it would be funny to get them drunk and let them loose at the
party.

1039
01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:33.640
That was easily in the top three scariest moments of my life.
No bullshit.

1040
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:37.300
People are hopping fences and fear of this guy.
He didn't hurt anyone,

1041
01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.610
but he dent the shit out of the tool shed.

1042
01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:48.130
See what I'm saying?
That's where there's always one asshole.

1043
01:05:48.131 --> 01:05:51.980
I don't give a shit.
I don't give a shit.
There's always going to be the,

1044
01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:55.870
he's trying to sell a fucking hand grenade.
I got a question for you guys.

1045
01:05:55.871 --> 01:06:00.360
Would you buy it?
I will not be so afraid.

1046
01:06:00.361 --> 01:06:04.170
I blow my fucking hand off.
But if someone bought it,
I would.

1047
01:06:05.350 --> 01:06:05.670
<v 9>Yeah.</v>

1048
01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:09.350
<v 11>I want to be in the vicinity and in the opposite direction to where they threw</v>

1049
01:06:09.450 --> 01:06:11.160
it.
I just want to be,
if there were any,
uh,

1050
01:06:11.161 --> 01:06:15.480
any military people listen to this podcast,
is there anything that you can,
uh,

1051
01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:21.730
how big is that?
It's like a hand grenade.
You know what I mean?
Like if someone,

1052
01:06:21.731 --> 01:06:23.680
like I'm,
I'm in a hotel room,
right?

1053
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:27.250
If somebody threw a hand grenade in this fucking room,
right?

1054
01:06:27.251 --> 01:06:30.610
And it was on the other side of my bed and I jumped on this side of the bed,

1055
01:06:30.850 --> 01:06:34.330
like fucking Tom Cruise and one of those mission of possible fucking movies,

1056
01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.140
you know,
in the movie I live,
what happens to me in real life?

1057
01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:44.540
You know what happens?
Do I what?
I immediately lose my hearing,

1058
01:06:45.110 --> 01:06:47.960
which shrapnel go through the bed with me in the bed.

1059
01:06:47.961 --> 01:06:51.560
Just go flying out the fucking window.
Would I be all right?

1060
01:06:53.570 --> 01:06:57.200
Will I stop asking questions?
All right,
let's move on.
Here's another one,
a bill,

1061
01:06:57.470 --> 01:07:00.800
a congrats on the tonight show and the movie.
Thank you.

1062
01:07:00.890 --> 01:07:04.970
And even more so on the dog.
I got a pair of,
let me read this.

1063
01:07:04.971 --> 01:07:08.870
This is the one I should have enlarged.
I got a pair of pound months,
uh,

1064
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:11.840
much two years ago,
and it changed my fucking life.

1065
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:16.370
The whole thing you said about not even knowing them a month ago and now already

1066
01:07:16.371 --> 01:07:19.610
dreading the day they're going to die.
Fuck,
I'm right there with you.

1067
01:07:19.611 --> 01:07:23.840
Dogs or kids who never disappoint.
Even when my girl ate my cell phone,

1068
01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:26.480
I loved her.
You mean Mike,
your girl dog.

1069
01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:31.400
I actually thought you meant your daughter.
That's fucking some idiot.
All right.

1070
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:36.560
Um,
anyways,
he said I still loved her.
I never knew I had it in me.
Um,

1071
01:07:37.690 --> 01:07:41.260
yeah,
man.
I,
I gotta I gotta fucking agree with you,
dude.

1072
01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:47.580
Eh,
fucking dogs are the greatest goddamn things ever.
And I respect cat people,

1073
01:07:47.581 --> 01:07:51.120
but I just,
I don't get it.
I don't get it.

1074
01:07:52.140 --> 01:07:55.380
Cats are like the hot chick at a bar,
man.
They just fucking,

1075
01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.210
they come to you when they need you and then they just,
I,
I respect cats.

1076
01:08:00.270 --> 01:08:05.130
I totally respect cats because a,
they're like loaners,
you know,

1077
01:08:05.460 --> 01:08:09.600
every once in a while they pop in,
hey,
what's going on?
You know,
how you been?

1078
01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:13.800
All right,
take it easy.
Then they leave.
I totally get that shit.
But like,
um,

1079
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:18.740
I don't know,
just the way they kind of come and go and they don't pay rent.

1080
01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.030
This is an arrogance to that,
you know,
I think dogs are a lot more appreciative,

1081
01:08:23.150 --> 01:08:28.100
you know,
I think they sense,
I think dogs have a bigger sense of,

1082
01:08:28.250 --> 01:08:32.240
uh,
the monetary system and cats do.
And plus cats practice killing you.

1083
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:36.950
I don't like that fucking girlfriend.
I had years back,
I,
you know,

1084
01:08:37.850 --> 01:08:39.680
I just,
I would just send something watching me,

1085
01:08:39.681 --> 01:08:44.000
I turned around and I catch the cat,
like stalking me.
It was annoying.

1086
01:08:44.940 --> 01:08:47.510
It was annoying that the thing little thing thought it was going to fucking do.

1087
01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.940
So I mean it could do something to me.
All right,

1088
01:08:49.941 --> 01:08:52.710
so I don't need all you cat people to be like,
dude,
let me tell you something.

1089
01:08:52.970 --> 01:08:56.780
Debt doing,
wanting to,
you know,
if I wanted to,

1090
01:08:57.290 --> 01:08:57.981
if I wanted to,

1091
01:08:57.981 --> 01:09:02.690
I could take out one of the many weapons that human beings have invented where I

1092
01:09:02.691 --> 01:09:05.720
could fucking kill a cat from across the room.
I got to tell you right now,

1093
01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:10.130
if Michael Vick was fighting cats,
he,
he,
he would've got community service.

1094
01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.850
People just don't give a shit about cats,
you know?

1095
01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.530
But people love,
they love dogs.
You can trash Katz.

1096
01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:22.700
I am telling you can be in a comedy doing standup comedy and you can fucking

1097
01:09:22.701 --> 01:09:25.760
trash cats and people just don't give a shit.

1098
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:29.060
But you start trash and dogs and people really,

1099
01:09:29.061 --> 01:09:33.890
they really have a problem with it.
You know,
can't say gross.

1100
01:09:33.891 --> 01:09:38.780
They shit in the house.
It's why,
why can't you just go outside and do that?

1101
01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:43.430
You know?
Ugh.
Is it ever,

1102
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:45.350
is the litter box ever clean?

1103
01:09:45.500 --> 01:09:50.460
Is there any guy out there you dating the girl with the fucking cat and this

1104
01:09:50.461 --> 01:09:52.730
stupid fucking things.
They have no boundaries.

1105
01:09:52.850 --> 01:09:55.910
They jump up on tables that are on the bed there on your chest.

1106
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.930
There are fucking on the couch.
You're an animal.
Get on the God damn floor.

1107
01:10:01.550 --> 01:10:02.383
If I had a cat,

1108
01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:06.470
I can't even begin to tell you how much I would fucking torture it.
You know,

1109
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:09.290
I would get one of those little spray bottles with the water.

1110
01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:11.600
I guess that's what you're supposed to use to keep them off the couch.

1111
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:16.400
I would just do that all the time.
Just in general.

1112
01:10:18.070 --> 01:10:21.900
Shoot him right in the fucking face.
That's what I would do.
You know?
Fuck off.

1113
01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:24.410
Fucking civil rights rally.

1114
01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:29.630
Damn fire hose right to the face.
Um,
all right.
I don't know.

1115
01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:33.140
I had to bring that up.
All right.
Um,
cash registered.
Hey Bill.

1116
01:10:33.141 --> 01:10:37.790
Did you see the Lakers?
Uh,
take the championship 99 86.
It was awesome.

1117
01:10:37.820 --> 01:10:41.180
Yes,
I did a,
Phil Jackson now has his record,

1118
01:10:41.181 --> 01:10:46.181
10th championship ring on his finger and you really look like a Leprechaun next

1119
01:10:46.281 --> 01:10:47.930
to Conan.
Every time I do Kona,

1120
01:10:48.190 --> 01:10:51.470
somebody tells me that you look like as gay little brother,
but Baba Baba Baba,

1121
01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:56.300
uh,
he's pretty tall.
He's six,
four,
I think he's actually like six foot six.

1122
01:10:58.070 --> 01:11:01.970
Um,
anyways also I was thinking about your position against self checkout lines.

1123
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:03.681
Um,

1124
01:11:03.681 --> 01:11:07.190
I was at the store the other day and saw there were only two people working at

1125
01:11:07.191 --> 01:11:10.460
registers and the other eight were self checkout lines.

1126
01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:14.250
It was appalling and half the time a person uses the self checkout

1127
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.550
something malfunctions and someone has to come over to help.

1128
01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:19.860
So why the fuck don't they just put a competent,

1129
01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.840
efficient individual at the register.

1130
01:11:22.200 --> 01:11:25.200
That's just another example of our increasing unemployment rate.

1131
01:11:25.201 --> 01:11:28.320
I totally agree with you.
People are fucking morons.

1132
01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.900
You want to see a classic example of fucking morons.

1133
01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.260
We're all those idiot standing in line to buy the new iPhone.

1134
01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:38.250
People have like the memory of like two minutes now

1135
01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:41.050
<v 1>and one of the first iPhone came out.
What happened?</v>

1136
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:43.810
Everybody ran out and they bought the fucking thing.

1137
01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:47.860
They stood in line like they were going to go see Bruce Springsteen backstage or

1138
01:11:47.861 --> 01:11:52.270
some shit.
They get the phone,
the phone's sucked,
the service sucked,

1139
01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.610
everything sucked.
It was overpriced.

1140
01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:59.350
They recalled something and then two months later they fixed it,
right?

1141
01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:04.090
And then the second wave,
we're better phones for like $200 cheaper.

1142
01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.910
So why the fuck when the next phone comes out?

1143
01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.960
Would you run in line to buy the first one again?
You know why?

1144
01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:12.910
Cause you are dumb.
Fuck.
That's why.

1145
01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:17.290
And you had the same dumb fuck who goes into a supermarket and uses one of those

1146
01:12:17.291 --> 01:12:19.930
automated cashier lines.
Cause you think it's easier.

1147
01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:23.170
You think it's quicker and you think it's better.
You're a moron.

1148
01:12:23.290 --> 01:12:26.680
You're working for free for the supermarkets and you help them put people out of

1149
01:12:26.681 --> 01:12:29.590
jobs.
You before fucking a month ago,

1150
01:12:29.710 --> 01:12:31.870
two people did the job for you for free.

1151
01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.060
You just stood there with your hands in your pockets.

1152
01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:40.400
<v 11>Whatever.
Dude,
you know what?
You're fighting a losing battle.
People are morons.</v>

1153
01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:44.750
And if you come out with some shiny new shit,
the lineup to go do it.

1154
01:12:44.751 --> 01:12:46.970
I don't give a fuck what it is.
All right,

1155
01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.510
there's my little fucking editorial for the week.
All right.
Uh,
sports,

1156
01:12:51.590 --> 01:12:55.490
knowing things in sports.
Pau Gasol,
his fucking face.

1157
01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:01.310
Come on Laker fans.
You got to admit it.
All right?
You won the championship.

1158
01:13:01.311 --> 01:13:02.990
You're in a good mood.
You gotta admit,
come on.

1159
01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:06.470
If that guy wasn't fucking playing for you,

1160
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:12.200
that vice head,
oh,
that itchy beard.
It's like,

1161
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:16.640
is he doing like,
what was that show we had the queer eye for the straight guy.

1162
01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.330
That's what he needs.
He needs like a makeover,
you know,

1163
01:13:20.420 --> 01:13:23.990
I think he just realizes he's weird looking and he's trying to cover it up with

1164
01:13:23.991 --> 01:13:27.320
hair.
Um,
all right.
You know,

1165
01:13:27.321 --> 01:13:30.350
one of these days I'm going to run into that guy and he's going to take his size

1166
01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:35.060
fucking 19 sneaker and he's gonna start me right on the face.
Um,

1167
01:13:35.090 --> 01:13:39.980
anyways,
over over time this guy gets fouled or commits a foul.

1168
01:13:39.981 --> 01:13:41.660
Every time he gets a follow commits,
a foul,

1169
01:13:41.661 --> 01:13:43.700
he acts like somebody committed a crime.

1170
01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:48.990
I know I've been doing an impression of him on stage and a,
any podcasts,

1171
01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.980
listeners,
if you come out to one of my shows,
uh,

1172
01:13:52.010 --> 01:13:55.850
if anytime you want to yell that out,
please do it in between jokes.

1173
01:13:55.910 --> 01:14:00.080
I would really appreciate that.
Don't do that during a joke.
Um,

1174
01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:03.750
that moment during my set when I look lost and I act like I'm thirsty,

1175
01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:05.150
taking a sip of water,

1176
01:14:05.180 --> 01:14:07.610
but I'm really trying to think about what the fuck I'm going to talk next.

1177
01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:12.580
Yell it out then.
And as an added bonus,
I'll do my Derek Jeter impression.

1178
01:14:14.410 --> 01:14:18.040
My Derek Jeter impression is,
uh,
the impression of Derek.

1179
01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:23.440
A impression of Derek Jeter taking a fast ball right down the middle of the

1180
01:14:23.441 --> 01:14:27.970
plate.
Uh,
for strike one.
I do what I do.
You know,

1181
01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.490
I do a fantastic impression of what he does anyways.
Uh,
ps,

1182
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:36.040
what do you think of the Stanley Cup games?
Seven.

1183
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.780
I thought it was an amazing game.

1184
01:14:37.781 --> 01:14:41.830
Grateful hockey and surprising the wings choked.
Thanks again for the podcast.

1185
01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:44.740
Do the wings didn't choke.
You know,

1186
01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:48.100
that's the new age of sports.
If somebody wins,

1187
01:14:48.101 --> 01:14:50.620
that means the other person choked.
They didn't choke.
They just weren't,

1188
01:14:51.710 --> 01:14:56.470
the penguins were a better fucking team,
you know.
Um,
I dunno,

1189
01:14:56.471 --> 01:14:59.710
that was,
that was a great,
that was a great series.
Um,

1190
01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:02.440
I liked it and I was psyched.
I had mixed emotions.

1191
01:15:02.441 --> 01:15:06.370
I didn't want to see Detroit when,
again,
just out of jealousy.
But,

1192
01:15:07.450 --> 01:15:11.770
um,
I'm still bummed the Steelers won the super bowl,
you know,

1193
01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.540
fucking patriots caught right up to them.

1194
01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:18.190
We were one behind them and now somehow were three behind him again.
But,

1195
01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.820
uh,
you know,
I don't know about a respect to Steelers.
I mean,

1196
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:23.740
they were always beating powerhouses for their titles.

1197
01:15:23.741 --> 01:15:28.741
Now like the Seattle Seahawks and the Arizona cardinals and uh,

1198
01:15:28.931 --> 01:15:29.651
you know,
who knows,

1199
01:15:29.651 --> 01:15:34.651
maybe next year they'll play the saints for the biggest trophy in pro football.

1200
01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:39.520
Oh,
I have no right to be bitter.

1201
01:15:39.550 --> 01:15:41.890
I just want to see the Bruins won a Stanley Cup and then I'm done.

1202
01:15:41.891 --> 01:15:43.930
And then obviously I'm,
you know,
hey is another,

1203
01:15:44.050 --> 01:15:46.240
this is another way I'm going to get out of fucking a,

1204
01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.800
I'm going to get out of watching baseball when the rest of my heroes fucking

1205
01:15:50.801 --> 01:15:55.540
test positive is a
Wimbleton Wimbleton tennis starts,

1206
01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:59.090
uh,
starts this week,
that'll kill another week.

1207
01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:01.240
So then all I gotta do is just worry about July.

1208
01:16:01.660 --> 01:16:04.930
And at that point there's gotta be some arena football.

1209
01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.790
What do you football fans who just refuse to watch baseball.

1210
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:10.900
What do you do during July?

1211
01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:14.170
Maybe I could get out of the house and actually work out,
you know,

1212
01:16:15.190 --> 01:16:19.260
take up sailing.
All right,
this is the end of the podcast.
This one is a,

1213
01:16:19.270 --> 01:16:22.980
this one's kind of short this week,
but it's late at night.
And um,

1214
01:16:24.040 --> 01:16:26.470
I dunno if it rains tomorrow,
I'm going to end up shooting,

1215
01:16:26.471 --> 01:16:29.290
I believe have no idea.
It's very up in the air.

1216
01:16:29.291 --> 01:16:32.380
So I probably should get some sleep.
Um,

1217
01:16:32.410 --> 01:16:35.320
even though they really don't call us until five.
What can else,
can I talk,

1218
01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:37.540
I don't know how else to fucking talk about.
Oh,

1219
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:41.350
I added a date that I do not have up on my website yet.
Uh,

1220
01:16:41.410 --> 01:16:45.160
hopefully I'll have it up by the time I post this.
Um,

1221
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:51.000
I am doing another Monday only show at the punchline in a San Francisco.

1222
01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.320
Um,
I did one back in March.

1223
01:16:56.350 --> 01:17:00.130
I did two shows and I just went up and I just sorta told stories while I kind of

1224
01:17:00.131 --> 01:17:03.040
did my act.
And um,

1225
01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.310
I had probably two of the best sets I can ever remember having.

1226
01:17:06.850 --> 01:17:10.700
So I'm sure this time,
uh,
I dunno.

1227
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:13.040
I know I'm going to have a good time again.

1228
01:17:13.041 --> 01:17:16.430
I just always have a good time when I'm up there and uh,

1229
01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:21.740
I dunno.
That's it.
That's the end of the fucking podcast.
I'm getting loopy here.

1230
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:24.040
I actually know what I've been doing during the day.
They got to,

1231
01:17:24.050 --> 01:17:27.320
I found another studio here in New York where I can go play fucking drums and

1232
01:17:27.321 --> 01:17:32.321
I'm telling you I'm inching closer and closer to being able to play that good

1233
01:17:33.651 --> 01:17:37.650
times,
bad times.
If I just fucking played drums,
I swear to God I,

1234
01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:39.560
I would've had it down by now.

1235
01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.790
But I always go like all these days in between fucking drumming and shit.

1236
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.200
But I'm telling you and when I get that thing down without a doubt,

1237
01:17:48.201 --> 01:17:51.770
I'm going to fucking make a video of it and you guys can all trash me about what

1238
01:17:51.771 --> 01:17:55.940
a Douche bag I looked like,
but I'm still going to be able to play it and uh,

1239
01:17:57.830 --> 01:17:59.960
my foot is at,
you know what I'm talking about this shit right now,

1240
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:03.580
cause I know most people don't give a fuck is my foot is actually is,
is,

1241
01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:08.780
is aching right now for the amount I played for like two fucking hours and will,

1242
01:18:09.170 --> 01:18:13.130
and I was just working on this,
uh,
that Joe,
Joe Mayor,

1243
01:18:13.131 --> 01:18:16.130
that fucking heel toe thing.
I'm going to get that thing down.

1244
01:18:16.670 --> 01:18:21.020
I'm getting that down and I'm getting down those fast doubles and when I do,

1245
01:18:21.290 --> 01:18:25.640
oh boy.
Oh boy.
I still won't have a Gig.
All right.
All right.

1246
01:18:25.641 --> 01:18:28.670
That fucking ending sucked.
God dammit.
All right.

1247
01:18:28.671 --> 01:18:32.090
That's the end of the Monday morning podcast.
Uh,
somebody send me an MP.
Three.

1248
01:18:32.091 --> 01:18:35.330
I said I was going to put it up this week.
I just don't have the,
uh,

1249
01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:38.300
I don't have the fucking time right now.
Um,

1250
01:18:38.301 --> 01:18:40.910
when I get back to La in a couple of weeks,
I'm going to do it.

1251
01:18:40.911 --> 01:18:44.090
Somebody made me a new intro and if you guys want to try to,
uh,

1252
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.110
come up with an Intro,

1253
01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:47.660
I know we've got some musicians out there who listen to this.

1254
01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:50.630
If you want to write an intro song,
somebody a long time ago,

1255
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:55.340
some band offered to do that and uh,
I never really got back to them.

1256
01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:59.360
I think they were from Michigan.
I can't remember.
But,
uh,
if you want to do that,

1257
01:18:59.361 --> 01:19:02.780
go ahead now because I actually kind of know how to use garageband and I could

1258
01:19:02.781 --> 01:19:07.580
kind of splice it together.
Um,
yeah,
and that's it.

1259
01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:11.810
So that's it.
People.
Um,
I will be doing standup in New York City.

1260
01:19:11.811 --> 01:19:16.811
I actually worked the comedy cellar last a weekend and I might be at comics this

1261
01:19:19.221 --> 01:19:21.530
Wednesday,
um,

1262
01:19:21.531 --> 01:19:25.130
which that would be June 24th.

1263
01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.780
I might be doing it,

1264
01:19:26.781 --> 01:19:30.500
but there's also a chance that I might be shooting and I might not be there.
So,

1265
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:33.770
uh,
it's day to day,
just like a rod,

1266
01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:36.860
day to day and a Iran,
if you're listening,

1267
01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:40.640
I hope you get over your fatigue and I hope he took a nap.

1268
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:46.600
God,
I'm such a cunt.
All right.
You guys have a great weekend.
All right.

1269
01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:47.593
Take it easy.

1270
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:08.813
[inaudible]

1271
01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:44.730
<v 0>[inaudible] speech.
I'm speaking in tongues when I'm
Steve</v>

1272
01:21:52.110 --> 01:21:52.110
[inaudible].
