00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:19.800
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.270
Justice Thomas, who is
in the room downstairs,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.040
distinguished guest
and colleagues,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.320
thank you for joining the
law Library of Congress

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.370
and the United States
Supreme Court today

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:40.680
for the 2018 Supreme Court
Fellows Program annual lecture.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.650
My name is Jane Sanchez and
I have the honor of serving

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.550
as the 25th Law Librarian
of Congress.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.730
A little bit about the library.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.360
The law library serves as the
nation's custodian of a legal

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.990
and legislative collection
of nearly 3 million items

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.340
from all countries and
legal systems of the world.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.060
Our foreign law specialists
are a diverse group

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.390
of foreign trained attorneys who
provide information and analysis

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.230
on over 270 jurisdictions
in the world.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:29.080
Our skilled law library staff,
both American trained attorneys

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.700
and law librarians also
provide research assistance

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.740
and reference services on U.S.
federal and state legal issues.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.860
While our collections
and our expertise reach

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980
across all points of the globe,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.620
for today's event
we've partnered

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.830
with our next-door neighbor,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.300
who happens to be the
highest court in the country.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.930
By the way, they are
pretty good neighbors.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.820
They're quiet and they keep
to themselves pretty much.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.470
This afternoon we are pleased
to be able to collaborate

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.110
with the Supreme Court as
they celebrate their 45th year

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.560
of the Fellows Program.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.650
Please note that today's
program is being live-streamed

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.890
on the Library of Congress
YouTube channel, so all sound,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.740
images and remarks will
be captured on video.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.920
Please take a moment to silence
your cell phones and refrain

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.250
from taking photos on any
devices throughout the event.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.510
For that we would thank you.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.370
At this time, I would like
to invite to the stage,

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.360
Jeffrey P. Minear,
executive director

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.830
of the Supreme Court
Fellows Program and counselor

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.130
to the Chief Justice
of the United States.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.430
Thank you.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:54.730
[Applause]

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:03.340
&gt;&gt; JEFFREY MINEAR: Thank you,
Jane, for the warm introduction.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.980
And thanks to you and the
law Library of Congress

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.940
for your partnership
with the Fellows Program

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.900
in sponsoring this
afternoon's event.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.300
Since its creation in 1832
when John Marshall was serving

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.530
as Chief Justice, the law
library has been an important

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.410
resource and steady
friend of the court.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.160
We could not ask for
a better neighbor

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.510
than the largest law
library in the world,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.150
and they're pretty quiet too.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.100
Let me say a word about the
Supreme Court Fellows Program

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.160
and my capacity as its
executive director.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.790
Each year the Supreme Court
fellows commission made

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.940
up of judges and other
legal leaders appointed

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.550
by the Chief Justice selects
four talented professionals

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.990
to spend a year within the
federal judiciary participating

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.890
in court administration
while engaging in research

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.250
and other enrichment
opportunities.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.460
This afternoon's event is the
public component of two days

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.490
of activities in which we
celebrate our current Supreme

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.480
Court fellows and
bring together 45 years

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.570
of Fellows Program alumni.

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.870
Over the course of today

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.040
and tomorrow we'll
select next year's fellows

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.750
from the superb finalists
with us this afternoon.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.350
I understand we have
many law students with us

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.480
in the audience today,
as well as law clerks

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.420
from several courts in the
federal and state systems.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.720
If you have an interest

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.530
in how federal courts work I
hope you will take time to learn

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.400
about the Fellows Program

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.090
and consider applying
in a future year.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.020
I invite you to go to website
fellows .supreme Court.gov.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.770
Applications for the 2020
class will be due in November.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.200
But before you set to
work on your applications,

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.350
we have a great feature
this afternoon.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:46.710
We have as our distinguished
guest the 105th justice

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.890
of the Supreme Court
of the United States,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.720
the Honorable Clarence
Thomas, who has served

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.440
on the court since 1991.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.900
Ten years ago Justice Thomas
published his best-selling

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.090
autobiography, "my
grandfather's son."

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.250
It shared in his own words
his remarkable American story.

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:07.760
I commend it to anyone
seeking a compelling read.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.810
We have the book
available for purchase here

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.000
and at the Supreme
Court gift shop.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.500
We are fortunate to have
with us also Gregory Maggs

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.050
to moderate today's
conversation.

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.780
When we planned this
program, Greg was a professor

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.080
at George Washington
University Law School,

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.820
but in the past month he's
received his judicial commission

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.560
as a judge of the
United States court

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.620
of appeals for the Armed Forces.

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.500
Judge Maggs was a law clerk
to Justice Thomas in 1991

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.450
and before that to
justice Anthony Kennedy.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:40.800
Please join me in welcome
Justice Thomas and Judge Maggs.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.100
[Applause]

00:05:42.100 --> 00:06:05.910
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Do
you feel comfortable?

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.110
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: No.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.050
This is not the most
suitable position

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:13.800
for introverts, but you can ask.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.690
We like to be in the
shadows someplace.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.060
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: They're
having a great time...

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.360
[ Laughter ]

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.800
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: It
was just fine back there.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.100
You don't have anything to do?

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.400
[ Laughter ]

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.840
Oh, my goodness!

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.710
Sorry y'all are dragging
yourselves out on this day.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.170
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Mr. Minear
mentioned the 10th anniversary

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.200
of the publication of your
book "my grandfather's son."

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.700
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I
had forgotten about that.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.210
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: I
thought I would start

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.950
by asking you questions
ant the book.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:49.440
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: So
you're Judge Maggs now.

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.140
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: About a week.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.060
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
I think that's great.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.680
[ Laughter ]

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.890
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Just
changing the subject.

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.880
[ Laughter ]

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.770
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Yeah.

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:12.220
Justice, you start out the book
when you're nine years old.

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:16.150
Why is that the place to
start your autobiography?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.710
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know,
I had the manuscript to that

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.740
and Terry Teachott,
my final editor,

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:30.810
just a phenomenal human being
and editor and musician.

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:32.870
And he understood.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.560
He dug deep into the manuscript
and he said, you know,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:38.580
you have a great title.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.890
I had picked out the title
to "My Grandfather's Son,"

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:47.230
but he said you have to explain
the title within the first page

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:51.050
or two, and he said, I
found the explanation buried

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:52.910
in your manuscript.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.440
And the line is "I
was nine years old

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.690
when I met my father
q. " And he said,

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.970
most people wouldn't
think of that.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.020
Because ultimately my
grandfather is my father.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:10.620
So I'm my grandfather's
son, not my father's son.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:15.300
So that was my first encounter
that I remember with my father.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.890
And so that's why I
started it out there,

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:23.970
to explain why I was
my grandfather's son.

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.210
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Life
didn't start out too easy.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.540
You mention in the book
you grew up in Pinpoint,

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:31.250
and then in a home
that didn't have water,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.940
didn't have electricity.

00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:35.340
When the house burned
down you moved to Savannah

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:36.740
and conditions got worse.

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.410
I think you write
that in the winter

00:08:38.410 --> 00:08:41.090
of 1995 you remember
being hungry.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.560
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: 1955.

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.990
I was doing fine in 1995.

00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:47.290
[ Laughter ]

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:53.240
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: 1955, you
were hungry without knowing

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.800
when you would eat and
cold without knowing

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.100
when you would be warm.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.030
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
That's a horrible feeling.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:03.920
But, you know, today we kind
of -- I just get worn down.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.810
I was with a young woman
who happened to be black

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:12.340
in Kansas recently, and she said
something really interesting.

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:15.370
She said, I'm really
tired of having

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:17.160
to play the role of being black.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.950
I just want to go to school.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:24.780
And I think we -- at some point
we're going to be fatigued

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:27.310
with everybody being a victim.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:32.700
When I was a kid, there
were tons of people who were

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.900
in really bad circumstances.

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:40.540
My grandfather would not
let us wallow in that.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:45.180
And as you could tell throughout
this book, he's my hero.

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.580
He is the single greatest
human being I have ever met.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.770
Nine months of education, but he
never saw himself as a victim.

00:09:55.770 --> 00:10:00.800
He used to say he was
a motherless child.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.910
He never knew his father.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:06.390
His mother died when he was
seven or eight years old.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.560
Of course, they didn't have
birth certificates then,

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.110
so he never knew
quite how old he was.

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:15.150
And then he was raised
by his grandmother,

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:17.510
who was a freed slave.

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.920
Then she dies and then he
lives with an uncle who has 12

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:25.650
or 13 kids and who
was a hard man.

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.500
And yet he never complained.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.450
And he always said -- he would
have this saying "When you want

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.750
to whine or something...

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:37.520
He said, "you know, you have
to play the hand you're dealt."

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:41.410
This those days blacks
played big Whigs a lot.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:44.620
You have to play the
hand you're dealt.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:47.820
If you're dealt a bad hand,
you still have to play it.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.880
When we whine about things --

00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.890
if you look at the
bust in my office,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:57.170
my wonderful wife had made for
me when I went on the court,

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.580
his favorite quote
was "old man" can't

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.790
"is dead, I helped bury him.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:07.380
I don't know if you saw
the movie" The Help ."

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.680
That's my family.

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.980
We were the help.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:14.770
My mother maid $10 a week,
$5 more if you had car fare.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.870
My mother was a maid.

00:11:17.870 --> 00:11:21.550
My grandmother had been a maid.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.640
Cousin Bea was a maid.

00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.780
Cousin Doshier was a maid.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:31.660
All of them were maids.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.190
And they were the help.

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:36.720
And yet they never
ever complained.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.150
And life was hard.

00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.210
I mean, the things that
we consider hard today --

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.890
I had some college students ask
me a few years back how would I

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:47.400
explain, you know,
talk to them now

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.490
that the economy had
taken a down turn?

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:53.150
And I said...

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:55.110
And I'm looking at
them and I said,

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.720
how many of you don't
have cell phones?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:59.850
Of course, they all
had cell phones.

00:11:59.850 --> 00:12:01.900
How many of you don't
have a computer?

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.790
They all had computers.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:05.410
How many of you don't
have a car?

00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:07.210
I think all but one had a car.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.730
I said, you're so far above the
poverty line, and when I was

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.870
in school, you were
at the poverty line.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.570
You're making 90 cents an hour,
you had no money, no shoes.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:21.820
You had like boots
and things like that.

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.590
And you didn't worry about it.

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:26.400
Because virtually
everybody was there.

00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:29.020
And so when the economy
took a down turn,

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:30.320
when you're on the floor,

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.290
there isn't a whole
lot further you can go.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.640
And for them, they're losing

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:39.300
from up here to maybe
midway down.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.290
So I really had no
connection with them.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:43.590
But my further point...

00:12:43.590 --> 00:12:45.450
[ Laughter ]

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.750
I didn't have a radio.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:49.620
I didn't have a telephone.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:50.920
And they're complaining.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.760
And I certainly didn't
have a car.

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:54.900
But it wasn't a problem.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.770
Because you had your dreams.

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.690
You had your energy.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.680
You had more than the
people you grew up around.

00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.350
I grew up around a world
of total illiteracy.

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:04.650
That's the beauty.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:06.430
I'm in the Library of Congress.

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:08.130
Total illiteracy.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.050
But the thing they had was hope

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:14.910
that the next generation
would learn how to read.

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.440
They knew how important
it was for me.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.230
So my grandfather
wouldn't let me take --

00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:21.040
I was a really good athlete too.

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:23.550
I don't like to say that because
then people want you to kind

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.490
of show that you
were a great athlete.

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:27.910
And it's kind of too
late in the day now.

00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:29.920
[ Laughter ]

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.460
But the -- he would not give
us time off to play sports.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:36.040
We worked on the oil
truck or on the farm.

00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:40.560
But if it had to do with the
library, you could do it.

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:46.810
So at night he would let me
go to the Carnegie Library

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:50.190
where I started going
in the summer of 1955

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.180
for the noble reason that summer
of '55, I was seven years old

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:57.560
and we just moved into
this little tenement

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:01.290
on the east side,
and on Saturday,

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.670
they gave you cookies and juice.

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:08.900
So I went for the very
high-minded reason

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.360
of getting cookies and juice.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.470
And when you live in these
neighborhoods, cookies

00:14:13.470 --> 00:14:15.470
and juice are a real treat.

00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:19.310
Along the way, they
introduce you to Dr. Seuss.

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.000
And if I hear "see spot
run" one more time...

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.840
But it was wonderful.

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.080
And you got cookies and juice.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:33.200
But it gave me this image of the
library as this place to learn,

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.740
and it became a haven.

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.040
So I walked in here.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:38.650
I said, look where I am!

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:42.930
I come from a world of
illiteracy, treasured learning,

00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:46.080
and I get to be in a place of
learning with all the books

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.650
and people who are literate.

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:54.780
So that's a long way of saying
I was very fortunate to grow

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.790
up around people who saw
beyond their circumstances

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:04.340
and who refused to be limited by
those circumstances or to wallow

00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:08.950
in the sort of victim status
of their circumstances.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:10.250
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Tell me
more about your grandfather.

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:11.550
He was a very strict man.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:12.850
Was he unfair?

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.960
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
Oh, God no, no, no.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.130
People ask sometimes about
the nuns and my grandfather.

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:23.790
Because in those days you
had corporeal punishment.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:27.810
They said, did you get beatings?

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.170
Yeah, but not as
many as I deserved.

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:34.620
And my grandfather, whenever
he gave you one that he found

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.310
out was unfair, that you didn't
deserve at that time, he said,

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:40.670
that's what you got away with.

00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.100
And then you couldn't
-- what do you say?

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.550
Because you knew you
got away with stuff.

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:46.720
And every one of us knew...

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.030
oh, boy, I'm glad he
didn't get me on that one.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:55.490
But, no, my grandfather was a
hard man but not a harsh man.

00:15:55.490 --> 00:15:56.790
Life was hard.

00:15:56.790 --> 00:16:00.600
I mean, anybody in this
room who grew up in

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.550
that environment,
that is a hard life.

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:07.560
Where you have to figure out
how you're going to put a meal

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.090
on the table, where you --

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:13.810
there's a very fine
line between the --

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:20.220
between you not being able to
eat today and being able to eat.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.490
And the gratitude -- we
always said grace before

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.790
and after meal..

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:27.090
We're Catholic.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:31.570
And he would always be grateful
-- and this is almost --

00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:34.190
this is the old porcelain
top table.

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.270
My grandfather sat here.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.860
I always sat facing him.

00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:40.100
I don't know why I
got that position,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.610
where he would just
stare at you.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.390
Oh, my God, help me!

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.390
And my grandmother sat here

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.530
and my brother sat
here at a small table.

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:54.180
And he would always say, we
are grateful that we have food

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:58.390
on our table, clothes on our
back and a roof over our head.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.910
And it doesn't get
much better than that.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:03.970
So he was never unfair.

00:17:03.970 --> 00:17:05.660
He was very generous.

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.960
What he would do is --

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:11.150
let's say, he would make us
work to produce something.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:14.890
Then he would say, We
are able to provide

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.790
for others because we work.

00:17:17.790 --> 00:17:23.170
So we're able to give them
corn or beans or peas or syrup

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.870
or sugarcanes or
fruit, because we work.

00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:30.150
We were able to give them meat
because we raised the hogs.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:35.120
What he taught us we had
an obligation to do well

00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:36.910
so that we could do good.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.830
Particularly for others.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.200
So I could not call that fair.

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.280
I think my grand mather
was probably one of the --

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.260
grandfather was one of the most
compassionate people I've known,

00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.890
because he always
told us the truth.

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:53.810
He always told us the
truth about life and he --

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:58.110
so I asked my broth er,
my brother, unfortunately,

00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.170
died 18 years ago jogging.

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:03.140
He was a year and four months
younger and he and I grew

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:05.180
up with my grandparents.

00:18:05.180 --> 00:18:11.740
And I asked him when we were
in our 40s, we were very close,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:16.800
and I said, do you think my --
my grandfather, we went to live

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:24.850
with him in '55, said, "I will
never tell you to do as I say.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.420
I will always tell
you to do as I do.

00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:28.980
Watch me."

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:31.390
And so I asked my
brother years later,

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:36.240
after my grandfather was long
gone, was he ever a hypocrite?

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.910
And my brother said,
absolutely not.

00:18:39.910 --> 00:18:43.470
That he lived up to that,
to think about that.

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:46.690
Would you set yourself
up as the model

00:18:46.690 --> 00:18:49.080
and the example to
your own children?

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:52.010
And you say, do as I do.

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:54.800
Watch me every day.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.930
And once -- and we watched it.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.770
Because he would never
let us out of his sight.

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:04.050
And when he did let you out of
his sight, it was with the nuns.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:07.510
Or I could get away
from him to the library.

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.230
I loved the library.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.300
You know, the -- we
take it for granted now

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.160
because we have all these
computers now and all

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:18.650
that stuff, but just think of
yourself coming from a house

00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:22.560
with no books and you get
to walk into this world

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:29.480
and have encyclopedia Americana,
encyclopedia Britanica,

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:37.080
it had Wagner and all
sorts of fiction, you know,

00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:44.020
it had magazines Life,
Time, all the newspapers.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:47.890
It was a smorgasbord
every time you walked in.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.170
And you had the reference
library

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.540
and it would introduce
you to new things.

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.760
Then they introduce you
to National Geographic,

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.880
so you were all over the world.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.770
This is all in Savannah,
Georgia.

00:19:59.770 --> 00:20:01.840
This is a world of segregation,

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:05.000
so it gave you this
window to everything else.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.790
It gave you a window
beyond Georgia.

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:11.620
And the nuns encouraged it,
the librarians encouraged it.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.310
So I had an opportunity some
years ago to go back and write

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.950
and thank all the librarians,
and most recently I ran

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:23.460
into a lady in Savannah,
an elderly white lady,

00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.690
because I was among
the early kids who went

00:20:25.690 --> 00:20:30.680
to the Savannah Public Library,
desegregated, and I was kind

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.570
of a nuisance there
because I kept showing up.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.440
It was like I was
"Where's Waldo?"

00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.740
Where's Clarence?

00:20:37.740 --> 00:20:39.250
He's got to be here someplace.

00:20:39.250 --> 00:20:44.230
And it's time to get
away from my grandfather,

00:20:44.230 --> 00:20:48.270
and it was just this
amazing world.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:51.050
And I ran into this
elderly white lady

00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:53.420
and she started crying.

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:57.550
And she said, I helped you at
the Savannah Public Library.

00:20:57.550 --> 00:20:59.600
I said, oh, my gosh...

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.480
it was really kind of emotional

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:04.690
because I remember
how scared I was.

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.430
You have to cross in
those days a lot of lines,

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.990
but going to the library
was worth doing then.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.770
Anyway, that's the library.

00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:17.120
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Tell me more
about your Catholic education.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:19.130
And your decision
to go to seminary.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:20.740
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You
know, I look back --

00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:23.290
I used to ask Justice
Scalia about that.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:26.450
He thought it was
interesting we were so similar.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:28.520
He would say, Clarence...

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:32.660
he said, my parents, my father
was a romance literature

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.670
professor, my mother
was a teacher,

00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.530
so I know how I got here.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.730
How did you get here?

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:41.320
And why are we at
the same place?

00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:43.990
Why do we have the
same set of beliefs?

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.480
And I think the beauty
of having gone

00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.910
to parochial schools was
they taught us how to --

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.430
there was a right way to think
about things, that we have

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:58.090
to be honest with
ourselves, honest about math,

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.640
honest about physics,
honest about chemistry,

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:04.290
that you couldn't cheat when
you did your Latin translations

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:08.320
or German or French, because I
had all those in high school.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:12.600
And so I was talking recently
with someone and he said,

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.440
it was your formation,

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:17.180
that there was always a
right way to do things.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.800
There was an honest
way to do things.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.870
And the progression is, I
became Catholic when I went

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:31.690
to the second grade in 1955,
sister Rosa, a wonderful person.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:38.330
At any rate, I became
an altar boy

00:22:38.330 --> 00:22:41.220
and the progression is
you become an altar boy

00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:45.070
and if you progress as an
altar boy you consider whether

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:47.150
or not you have a vocation.

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:50.410
In those days you went
to a minor seminary.

00:22:50.410 --> 00:22:56.970
In 1964 I decided I thought
I had a vocation, so I was 15

00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:01.150
and then following year when
I was 16 I went to seminary.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.300
The difficulty was, again,

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.790
things hadn't been
desegregated yelt.

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.840
So you were, again,
drossing racial barriers, --

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.310
crossing racial barriers,
so you had that challenge.

00:23:12.310 --> 00:23:15.810
Even that was not nearly
as difficult as going

00:23:15.810 --> 00:23:19.020
to school in New England.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:22.440
No one -- there were
a few jerks.

00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.210
We all have those.

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.220
But beyond that, the
school was excellent.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:28.700
The people were fair to me.

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:32.150
It was very, very
challenging academically.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.150
And also I got to -- I like to
say I finished in the top ten

00:23:36.150 --> 00:23:37.450
of my high school class,

00:23:37.450 --> 00:23:39.410
but because there were
only nine of us...

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.710
[ Laughter ]

00:23:40.710 --> 00:23:43.710
You have to take these
things when you get them.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:48.210
That would be the last time
I would be able to say that.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:51.660
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What about
your decision to leave seminary?

00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.280
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
That was 1968.

00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:59.670
Any of us who were around
in 1968, it was 1968.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:04.320
The wheels were coming off
the wagons in a lot of ways.

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:10.650
And the little Catholic kid
from the rather insular world

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:16.320
of Savannah suddenly was reading
and it was a long, hot --

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:21.870
Dr. King was assassinated and
we became quite race conscious,

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.540
which problematic sides
and has good sides.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:32.430
And like a lot of us, went
from being nice Catholic kid

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.730
to the angry black kid.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:36.120
And that was 1968.

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.500
So then I returned home and was
greeted with my grandfather,

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.080
who told me that if
I'm going to do that,

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:47.040
then I need to find
another place to live.

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.740
So he kicked me out of the
house and I was on my own.

00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.040
I was 19 years old.

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.660
May 1968.

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:56.010
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: But
you went to Holy Cross?

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:59.000
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I
know there's all this myth

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.530
about how -- people love to come
up with narratives and myths.

00:25:02.530 --> 00:25:06.500
They should read or something.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:14.510
At any rate, my chemistry
teacher asked the high school

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:19.770
classmate of mine to
send me an application.

00:25:19.770 --> 00:25:23.190
I had ranked very high
in my class in seminary,

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:26.340
first year of college, and
I just simply filled it out

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:27.980
and I transferred to Holy Cross.

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:31.070
I was accepted almost
immediately and transferred

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:33.450
to Holy Cross in 1968.

00:25:33.450 --> 00:25:35.550
Pi wasn't going to go
because I was tired

00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:40.000
of being the only black
kid or one or two or three.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.260
I was going to go
to Savannah State,

00:25:43.260 --> 00:25:46.120
but then when my grandfather
disinvited me from living

00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.010
in his house, I thought it
might not be a good idea

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:51.780
to hang around.

00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:53.080
So I just...

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:57.200
I hadn't thought about
any other schools.

00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.880
So I had been accepted to Holy
Cross, so got on the train

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.180
and went to Holy Cross.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:06.170
You can see the planning I did.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.510
I say to people, my whole
life has been providential

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.350
because I certainly didn't
know what was going on.

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:15.000
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: In
your book, Justice,

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.410
you talk about being a radical

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:21.050
at Holy Cross, about
being angry.

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:23.230
Did you feel you were
treated unfairly?

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:24.530
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
At Holy Cross?

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:26.230
No, no, I was just
mad at the world.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:29.030
It was 1968.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.710
I was angry.

00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:35.380
I really didn't need a
logical reason to be angry.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.160
I was angry about things
that happened in the past.

00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:40.790
I was angry about things that
were going to happen in future.

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:42.960
If you said "good
morning" to me I was angry.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:46.430
If you didn't say "good
morning," I was angry.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:49.650
And people sort of
exploited that.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:54.690
And, you know, I was -- I
remember going to Harvard Square

00:26:54.690 --> 00:27:07.550
in April of 19 -- April 15,
1970, and we were pretty upset.

00:27:07.550 --> 00:27:11.190
You know, I couldn't explain
to myself why I just did that.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.100
All night we were rioting.

00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:17.650
And I got back home, got
back to Holy Cross and that's

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:20.110
when I made a promise to
God that I would never --

00:27:20.110 --> 00:27:22.570
that if he took anger
out of my heart,

00:27:22.570 --> 00:27:24.040
I would never do that again.

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:27.800
I would never let
anger control my life.

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.370
That was the morning
of April 16, 1970.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:33.370
And I've attempted
to live up to that.

00:27:33.370 --> 00:27:35.750
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What
made you choose law?

00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:38.580
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: It's
kind of the far scump effect.

00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.590
How do I know?

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:43.740
I was going to to be a priest.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:49.890
When you have a vocation,
you think the belief

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:51.190
of God is calling you.

00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:55.100
That's the only dream I've
ever had was to be a priest.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.040
I don't think it ever
quite leaves you.

00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.560
When I went off to Holy Cross,

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.290
I was in a little
bit of a tailspin.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:05.810
I was looking for the next
call, what am I called to do?

00:28:05.810 --> 00:28:08.870
So I decided that God
would call me to go

00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:11.060
to Savannah and to help out.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.080
And one way to do
that was to be in law.

00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:18.690
And so I went to law school
to return to Savannah.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.350
If you noticed, I never
really worked at a law firm.

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:26.090
I worked at a small firm in
Savannah, Georgia, in the summer

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:28.870
between second and third year
of law school because I wanted

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.700
to return to Savannah.

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:33.790
For reasons that I'm
not going to get into,

00:28:33.790 --> 00:28:36.880
that job did not live
up to my expectations.

00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:41.830
Now I've got a wife -- today
is my son's 45th birthday,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:45.190
so he was a little kid.

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:48.610
And I had a wife and
child and student loans.

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:51.450
And now I need a job,
because I'm not going back

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:54.740
to the situation that I don't
think is right in Savannah.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:58.520
And I couldn't get a job
in Savannah, Georgia.

00:28:58.520 --> 00:28:59.970
That's literally it.

00:28:59.970 --> 00:29:02.490
I couldn't get a job
in Atlanta, Georgia.

00:29:02.490 --> 00:29:03.890
I couldn't get a
job in Washington,

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.460
D.C. I couldn't get
a job in New York.

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:07.830
And I couldn't get a job in LA.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:10.790
I struck out every
place I could.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:13.730
So I wound up in
Jefferson City, Missouri.

00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:16.690
And because they
didn't give me a job

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.910
in Atlanta is the reason
I wound up on the court.

00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:21.320
So it's their fault.

00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.430
[ Laughter ]

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.690
Otherwise I would be comfortably
a tax lawyer or something.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:31.680
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Tell me
about your years at Yale.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.870
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
What about it?

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:37.650
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Do
you remember them?

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.350
[ Laughter ]

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:43.460
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I
think that had -- that was ages.

00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:45.260
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: No, no, no...

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.760
[ Laughter ]

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:52.910
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: That
was a slight on Yale.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:55.010
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You can
see I've always enjoyed my law

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.410
clerks, and we enjoyed
teaching together.

00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:01.530
We have had -- we've been
teaching together six

00:30:01.530 --> 00:30:07.760
or seven years at GW Law
School and had a total blast.

00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:12.230
It's a good thing they
don't really pay us for it.

00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:14.090
You're not going to get paid
now because you're going

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:17.980
to be adjunct like
the rest of us.

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:21.900
You know, Yale was the
perfect school for me.

00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:25.910
I've had my complaints
for reasons after Yale,

00:30:25.910 --> 00:30:31.100
but Yale showed me
where I needed to be.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:34.910
If I had -- if I went back

00:30:34.910 --> 00:30:37.480
to Yale I would go
differently today.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:42.180
I wouldn't go with all these
burdens of anger and bitterness

00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.410
and self-restrictions
and constraint.

00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.760
I would spend a lot of time
in the sterling Library,

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.160
which I loved being in.

00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:55.850
I would spend a lot of time
doing the things that I like.

00:30:55.850 --> 00:30:59.580
I would be like that
young kid at KU.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.090
I just want to go to school.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:03.370
I just want to be a kid.

00:31:03.370 --> 00:31:04.760
I like chamber music.

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.130
I'd go to that.

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:07.430
I like debates.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.470
I like recitals.

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:14.100
You know, I'm reading a
book now on the Plantagents.

00:31:14.100 --> 00:31:15.720
Keagan was at Yale.

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.710
I should have gone
to those lectures,

00:31:17.710 --> 00:31:27.100
whether it's Greek
history or myth or wars.

00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.720
The Peloponnesian
wars or something.

00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:32.500
I loved debates.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.020
I loved philosophy.

00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.950
And it was all there.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.940
I could go to Off
Broadway plays.

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.980
I didn't go to anything
because I was mad at the world.

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.310
I was self-restricted
in this place

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:45.720
that offered all
these opportunities.

00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:47.410
The law school was good for me

00:31:47.410 --> 00:31:51.260
because it showed me how
much work I needed to do,

00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.330
to do what I wanted to do.

00:31:53.330 --> 00:31:58.610
How much I needed to learn
and a question I asked myself

00:31:58.610 --> 00:32:02.290
when I left was: Are you
willing to do the work?

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:04.300
Are you willing to
dedicate yourself

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.100
to learning all you need?

00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.880
And so I would have to say in
retrospect, it was small enough,

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.880
it was academically
challenging, it was interesting,

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.810
the professors were fair to me.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:25.000
It wasn't the best choice
as far as being able

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.480
to distinguish yourself,
because of the grading system.

00:32:28.480 --> 00:32:32.450
But I can't say -- I can't look
back and offer any complaints.

00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:35.580
I know in the past I've
not said pleasant things,

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:39.700
but that would have to do
with some other reactions.

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:42.090
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Let's move
forward to confirmation process.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:46.630
A third of your book has to
do with confirmation process.

00:32:46.630 --> 00:32:48.500
That's been 27 years or so.

00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.790
How was your view
of being confirmed

00:32:51.790 --> 00:32:53.090
and the politics involved?

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:56.390
How is all that --
have you changed a bit?

00:32:56.390 --> 00:32:59.580
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You know, I
think it's sort of like surgery,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:06.660
the only minor surgery
is on the other guy.

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:10.750
I don't think the process
is what it ought to be.

00:33:10.750 --> 00:33:13.220
I think that these
are serious jobs

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.960
and I think they
should be serious.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.300
I don't think they
should become spectacle.

00:33:17.300 --> 00:33:19.840
This is not the Roman coliseum.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.690
We're not glad yaiters.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:25.740
I think we're going to lose
some of our best people

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:29.080
who choose not to go
through the ordeal.

00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:34.430
They don't want to have to fight
the lion in order to be a judge

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:35.730
or to be in government.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:39.720
And I think it's our own fault
for allowing this to happen.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.680
I was confirmed five
times in ten years.

00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:46.510
And it got increasingly worse.

00:33:46.510 --> 00:33:50.370
And I think that we are going

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:57.350
to at some point have the
leadership we deserve.

00:33:57.350 --> 00:34:02.170
Because we allow the
selection process to get

00:34:02.170 --> 00:34:05.880
out of our control and
to have very little to do

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:10.380
with selecting the
kind of people we need.

00:34:10.380 --> 00:34:11.680
Think about it.

00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:14.350
You went through confirmation.

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:17.650
And yours wasn't
particularly controversial,

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:20.020
but it was an ordeal.

00:34:20.020 --> 00:34:22.590
And what if it was embittered?

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:28.510
And I think a lot of
people have second thoughts.

00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:31.150
I can't tell you how many
people I know who in the middle

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:33.720
of it said "what
was I thinking?"

00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:35.840
I think that's unfortunate.

00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.720
I think the country is going to
lose something because of that.

00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:45.010
So, you know, I don't
have bitter feelings

00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:46.310
or anything like that.

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:48.830
I don't have strong reactions.

00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:53.370
But I think I'm sober in my
judgment of it and I think a lot

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:57.040
of the difficulties are
irrelevant to the jobs.

00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.340
Think about it.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:03.090
How many people, for
example, who have done the job

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:08.220
of judging, who actually
talk about judges,

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:11.030
it's usually the people doing
the most talking have never

00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:13.320
judged a single case.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:17.110
I find it absolutely
fascinating.

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:19.760
A lot of the commentary
has nothing

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:21.330
to do with the job itself.

00:35:21.330 --> 00:35:24.320
I found when I got
to the D.C. Circuit,

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.360
I found that job
absolutely fabulous.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.550
The people there were fabulous.

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.880
And to the Supreme Court,

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.060
after going through
all those difficulties,

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:37.710
the members of the court
were just wonderful people.

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:41.800
To a person, it was a
fabulous place to work.

00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:43.200
You were there.

00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.540
It was a lot of work.

00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:46.960
It was very difficult
first term,

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:51.420
but in retrospect it was an
exciting time, just the ideas

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:55.160
and learning, and everybody
there made it as decent a place

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.630
as it could possibly be.

00:35:56.630 --> 00:36:00.920
So the Court itself is quite
different from the ordeal.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:05.820
It's almost the opposite of the
or deal it took to get there.

00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:07.210
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What are
the best and worst things

00:36:07.210 --> 00:36:09.350
about being a Supreme
Court justice?

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:11.380
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: The
best I think would have

00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:19.220
to be interacting with my
kids as they clerk to going

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:20.970
through life, watching you all.

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:24.280
It's just -- that's
the best part.

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:30.980
I would have to say, too, my
wife is now a former law clerk.

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:33.420
She is emeritus.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.100
We gave her honorary
law clerk degree.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.100
But watching her...

00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:42.700
my wife was 34 years old
when I got to the court.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:49.360
Watching her enjoy the clerks
and the kids, it is such a joy.

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:51.340
I remember when Nicholas
was born.

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:52.790
Now what is he doing?

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:55.910
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS:
Graduate school.

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:57.210
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Yeah.

00:36:57.210 --> 00:36:58.830
So, watching all of that,
it's just fantastic.

00:36:58.830 --> 00:37:02.780
And then when Janice got
married, you know, it's just --

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.670
so that's the best part.

00:37:04.670 --> 00:37:06.660
The worst part is the
loss of anonymity.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:11.040
I don't like the public part.

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.520
But that's a part of the deal.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:15.730
I'm not going to complain
about it, but I just --

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:20.180
those of you who are introverts,
you know what I'm talking about.

00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.720
We prefer -- it's
sort of like I said

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.520
to my clerks who
were introverts.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.650
Introverts of the world unite.

00:37:26.650 --> 00:37:32.540
And then they said, but do
we have to go to meetings?

00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.840
[ Laughter ]

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:39.880
So I read Susan Cane's
book "quiet,"

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:43.160
which I think is the best book.

00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:47.550
For those of us who
are introverts,

00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.620
that's the hard part,
the public part.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:55.610
You know what, I
could add to that.

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.910
It's not a complaint.

00:37:56.910 --> 00:37:59.220
All of this is a
part of the deal.

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.990
I have no complaints.

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:12.160
I don't like the myth-making
around the Court and who we are.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.770
There's a real decided
difference between what is said

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:20.070
about what goes on in
judging and the Court

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.640
and what actually happens.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:26.770
There's the real world and
there's the myth of that world.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:35.330
We don't have the time, the
energy or the ink or the bits

00:38:35.330 --> 00:38:43.320
or bites or whatever they
call that to change to engage

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:45.480
in that narrative battle.

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:46.780
We have work to do.

00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:48.330
We have to write opinions.

00:38:48.330 --> 00:38:54.380
I've been around a lot of
judges, whether you agree

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:58.210
with them or not, they
actually put the work in.

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:01.090
It's a wonderful
world to work in.

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:05.050
Where you actually have
to write out your opinions

00:39:05.050 --> 00:39:08.210
and think things through
and have arguments and go

00:39:08.210 --> 00:39:10.180
through all the statutes and go

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:12.820
through all the constitutional
provisions and go

00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:14.120
through all the rules

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.300
of statutory interpretation
or construction.

00:39:18.300 --> 00:39:22.160
All the interpretive cannons.

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.510
It's fascinating.

00:39:24.510 --> 00:39:26.600
So I like that world.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.500
But then the world
that people talk

00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.680
about that you don't
agree on something...

00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.000
oh, you hate old people!

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:37.120
What!? Or you want
to execute people.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.920
I haven't met a judge who
wants to execute anybody.

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:43.110
I haven't met that judge yet.

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:49.950
In fact, every judge I have
met, going through these cases,

00:39:49.950 --> 00:39:51.910
look at what it does
to your hair.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:55.430
So you start out, your hair
is black, you have lots of it,

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:58.480
and then all of a sudden
you're follicle-ly impaired.

00:39:58.480 --> 00:40:02.210
And it's gray.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.910
Oh, my God, another execution!

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:08.050
Every one of us is like,
did I get it right?

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:10.350
Did I make a mistake?

00:40:10.350 --> 00:40:15.320
And yet you have the people
who create the myth about it.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.060
, who think that somehow you're
callously doing these things.

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.260
Those are people who never
stayed up in the middle

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:23.770
of the night and voted
for one of these things.

00:40:23.770 --> 00:40:26.070
So I like being around judges.

00:40:26.070 --> 00:40:28.030
I like the work.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.650
I like the world
that I'm a part of.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:36.330
I think the world
-- those who talk

00:40:36.330 --> 00:40:40.450
about it are not doing the
world justice or the rest

00:40:40.450 --> 00:40:43.550
of the fellow citizens
justice in talking

00:40:43.550 --> 00:40:46.880
about an important part
of their government.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.180
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS:
Talking about the work,

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:50.510
I notice the Supreme
Court statistics

00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:53.900
that for the last two years
you have written about twice

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:56.070
as many opinions as any
of the other justices.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:57.370
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: That's
because I really don't talk,

00:40:57.370 --> 00:40:59.050
so I get to write a lot.

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:01.430
[ Laughter ]

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:03.020
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS:
Why so many opinions?

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.350
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Who knows?

00:41:04.350 --> 00:41:08.770
Justice Scalia said
I was solisistic.

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:12.470
I said, I have no
idea what that means,

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.970
but I like the ring of it.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:18.920
So I think that means
I like my own opinions.

00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:23.270
He said once, Clarence,
you don't care

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.540
for other people's
opinions, do you?

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:29.180
No, I do care, but
I prefer my own.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.090
I don't know.

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:40.780
I think it is really
important that when you vote

00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:43.640
for these things
that you explain why,

00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.390
and that if it doesn't make
sense -- my granddaddy --

00:41:47.390 --> 00:41:50.390
I'm not going to use the
words he used exactly,

00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.690
but he would say...

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:55.410
"Boy, if it don't make no
sense, it don't make no sense."

00:41:55.410 --> 00:41:58.270
He would spice it
up a little bit.

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:03.350
And, you know, things
have to make sense to me.

00:42:03.350 --> 00:42:07.810
When you come from the lower
levels of society, when you --

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:10.570
poverty, things have
to make sense.

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:13.320
My granddaddy, either
you fed the hogs

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.380
or you didn't feed the hogs.

00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.330
You greased the tractor or
didn't grease the tractor.

00:42:18.330 --> 00:42:21.990
You either planted the corn
or you didn't plant the corn.

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:23.520
It was binary.

00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.880
It was clear.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.020
And I think when
we do these cases,

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:31.120
we owe it to our fellow
citizens to explain

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.970
in plain language
what we are doing.

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.210
And sometimes when
you see me writing,

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.600
it's because what the Court is
doing, the premise, I think,

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.760
disagree with, and
I think it's wrong.

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.060
And if you go back and you look
at the Court of Appeals judges,

00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:51.730
I think it is a little
bit glib --

00:42:51.730 --> 00:42:56.830
I'm not going to say
disrespectful -- for us to --

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.740
when there are differences
of opinions in the Courts

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:02.970
of Appeals and District Courts,

00:43:02.970 --> 00:43:07.940
for us not to explain why
we hold a different opinion

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:13.470
from them or not to fully
explore the opinions below,

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:16.600
and just glibly disagree.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.580
And I think we owe
them that respect.

00:43:19.580 --> 00:43:23.670
So I worked through everything.

00:43:23.670 --> 00:43:27.280
And I probably put a lot of
pressure on my law clerks.

00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.900
I wouldn't clerk for me.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.830
That is way too much work.

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:33.610
And I tell them that
before they're done.

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.310
Are you sure you
want to do this?

00:43:35.310 --> 00:43:37.080
Why are you doing this?

00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:43.680
You know there's
a 13th amendment.

00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.980
[ Laughter ]

00:43:44.980 --> 00:43:46.280
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What's changed

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.910
in your judging over
the 27 years?

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:53.070
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: That
is really a good question.

00:43:53.070 --> 00:44:05.170
Judge. You know, it's sort of
like if you climb a mountain,

00:44:05.170 --> 00:44:08.030
when you're at 1,000
feet, you see something.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.260
You still look at
the same scenery,

00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:12.920
but you have a different
view from when you're

00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.220
at 10,000 feet or
5,000 5,000 feet.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.070
You see more.

00:44:18.070 --> 00:44:23.240
I've been doing this so
long that you see more.

00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:26.370
You understand more.

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:30.140
The reason I was reading this
book on the Plantaginents was

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.510
because of English common law,
starred out people do a lot

00:44:34.510 --> 00:44:38.750
of talking about stare decisis,
so I decided to teach a course

00:44:38.750 --> 00:44:41.610
to understand it in depth.

00:44:41.610 --> 00:44:44.270
But to understand stare decisis,

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:46.260
you have to understand
English common law.

00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.960
To understand English common
law, you have to understand

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.860
where England came from,
the Norman conquest,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.540
the Vikings, the Romans.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.210
Then to understand that you
have to trace those histories.

00:44:58.210 --> 00:45:01.140
So anyway, I've done that
and now I'm fascinated

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:07.050
by the Platginents and what
they've done developing England.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.510
What were they doing?

00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:11.960
Why did the king pull
all this together?

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.800
But to understand you've got to
pull all the history together.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.790
But look how many
years that takes.

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:18.760
That's what I learned at Yale.

00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:20.130
This wasn't a sprint.

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:21.700
It was a marathon.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.830
It was a life-long endeavor.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:27.350
It's what you and I do when
we teach constitutional

00:45:27.350 --> 00:45:28.650
law together.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.380
Look at the cases we've read.

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:33.650
Look at how in-depth
we've read those cases.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:37.180
How many people care
about Crop v. Dulles.

00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:38.710
You and I do.

00:45:38.710 --> 00:45:40.240
We care about it.

00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.750
Vlas v. Cohen.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:44.340
Decided but they don't read it.

00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:45.680
You and I do.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.230
We have to.

00:45:47.230 --> 00:45:51.000
Why? Because we're messing with
other people's constitution.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.340
You and I have to do
it, and you know why.

00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.440
We have to go back
and read the briefs.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.320
Because we're tinkering with
other people's constitution.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.160
We don't have any
unlimited license to do that.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.300
And we certainly don't have a
right to be reckless with it.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.760
So over the years what you learn
is it's like you've peeled --

00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.510
you've gone higher
or another metaphor,

00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:18.320
you're peeling the onion and
you understand, you see more.

00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.910
Not because you're smarter
or because people love

00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:25.770
to set themselves up as
philosopher, kings or something.

00:46:25.770 --> 00:46:28.460
No. It's because you've
been doing it longer.

00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:30.280
This is what I do.

00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:32.760
I don't have hobbies.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:36.620
Well, except for
rooting against Alabama.

00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.920
[ Laughter ]

00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:46.650
You knew it was coming,
didn't you?

00:46:46.650 --> 00:46:50.950
Oh, my gosh, they stole
another national championship!

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.670
You know, I...

00:46:55.670 --> 00:46:57.290
I don't...

00:46:57.290 --> 00:46:59.780
This is what I do.

00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:07.120
I do law. And it consumes you.

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:10.410
And virtually everything I do is

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:12.790
in preparation of
doing this job.

00:47:12.790 --> 00:47:14.260
I think I owe this.

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:16.240
Remember, it's about
your calling.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:19.050
And if you're called
to do it, you're called

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:20.350
to do it a certain way.

00:47:20.350 --> 00:47:23.420
If you go back and
look at Justice Scalia,

00:47:23.420 --> 00:47:25.090
look what he died doing.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.640
People forget, he
had finished --

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:33.510
he thought it was our job to fly
the flag, to go different places

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:37.290
and to talk to people
about what we do.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:39.230
He was more outgoing than I am.

00:47:39.230 --> 00:47:43.890
But he would tell me, Clarence,
you got to fly the flag.

00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:46.440
You have to go out there.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:49.810
Then the other thing,
when he did his work,

00:47:49.810 --> 00:47:52.360
everything mattered to him.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.930
Every sentence.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:55.230
Every word.

00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:56.530
Every comma.

00:47:56.530 --> 00:47:57.830
Every idea.

00:47:57.830 --> 00:47:59.130
It all mattered.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.000
And it mattered.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.310
That's one of the reasons
we trusted each other.

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:06.680
Because we both knew
it mattered.

00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.210
Getting it right was
important to both of us.

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:12.410
Why would we do it otherwise?

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:13.710
Why would we be doing this?

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.010
This is wrong.

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.690
How would you look your
fellow citizens in the eye

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.220
if you didn't get it right?

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.740
If I looked at you and
told you, oh, I don't care.

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.040
I kind of...

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.720
you know, I go and watch
cartoons and then, you know,

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.460
I kind of flip coins
for your constitution.

00:48:29.460 --> 00:48:31.900
Or I just kind of do
whatever I want to do.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:33.380
I would never do that.

00:48:33.380 --> 00:48:35.810
Ever. Because that's wrong.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.480
And he believed the same thing.

00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:39.070
We took an oath to
do it a certain way.

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:42.620
So I think I have to
inform myself in order

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.080
to make decisions about
your constitution.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.700
And you feel the exact same way.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.620
And you just became a judge.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.840
And you know you feel
exactly the same way.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.740
That you have a special
obligation

00:48:56.740 --> 00:48:58.280
or you wouldn't have
been 28 years

00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.220
as a Reservist in the military.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.050
Or the best teacher
at GW Law School

00:49:03.050 --> 00:49:04.740
for a quarter of a century.

00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:07.850
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Talk about
your teaching, Justice.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.220
[ Laughter ]

00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.000
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I knew
you'd change the subject.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.450
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: You've taught
at Georgia and George Mason, GW.

00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:18.400
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I love it.

00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.980
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: What
is your goal in teaching?

00:49:19.980 --> 00:49:23.570
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: You
know, I think that we --

00:49:23.570 --> 00:49:28.270
I think that people
make learning --

00:49:28.270 --> 00:49:29.810
well, let me back up.

00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:32.500
Did you see the wizard of Oz?

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.170
Who was the wizard?

00:49:34.170 --> 00:49:37.240
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS:
Who was the wizard?

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.030
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
This little guy.

00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:42.590
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: The little
guy, I could have said that.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:44.910
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: I think
what we do sometimes is we make

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:46.740
everything mysterious.

00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:49.190
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Don't
look behind the curtain.

00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.620
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS: Yeah,
that's what we do in our class.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:53.210
It's not mysterious.

00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:56.410
There was a young man in
our constitutional law class

00:49:56.410 --> 00:49:59.750
at the end, he said, I'll never
look at law the same again.

00:49:59.750 --> 00:50:01.740
I don't know what
his meanings were.

00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.890
I don't care what
his ideology is.

00:50:03.890 --> 00:50:07.030
What we were trying to get
him to do is de-mystify it.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:09.970
It's not that complicated.

00:50:09.970 --> 00:50:11.950
Why do we make it complicated?

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:13.340
Why do we make it inaccessible?

00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.740
I had a buddy who
was a quadriplegic,

00:50:15.740 --> 00:50:23.110
back in the '70s before you
have the flush and curb cuts.

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:29.930
Every time we got a curb, it
was a great wall of China.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:36.060
If we weren't there to lift
him, it was inaccessible to him.

00:50:36.060 --> 00:50:39.000
To some extent that's
what we do to law.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.480
We start talking about
negative pregnants

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.460
and use double entendres
and throw

00:50:44.460 --> 00:50:46.920
in a little Latin
or a little of this.

00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:49.250
Why don't we talk in English?

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:52.910
That farmer in rural
Alabama has a right

00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:55.260
to know what his
constitution says.

00:50:55.260 --> 00:50:57.720
And so what I do is --
one of the things I say --

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:00.280
and I said it even
when you were clerking,

00:51:00.280 --> 00:51:06.690
is that genius is not
putting a $20 ten-cent idea

00:51:06.690 --> 00:51:09.180
in a $20 sentence.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:15.000
Genius is putting a $20
idea in a ten-cent sentence.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.820
It is to make it accessible
as possible to average people.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:23.080
So when I used to go back
home, think about it,

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:28.610
I came from a world of
illiteracy, near illiteracy.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:33.400
And when you went back home, you
could not talk down to people.

00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:34.700
That's what they
would say to you.

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.630
They wouldn't use the
word "condescend."

00:51:36.630 --> 00:51:38.330
That wasn't in their vocabulary.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:42.940
You're talking down to me,
you're putting me down.

00:51:42.940 --> 00:51:47.970
But you have to explain things
to them without treating them

00:51:47.970 --> 00:51:49.570
like they're lesser
human beings.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:54.270
So it's what we used to say in
the vernacular back in the '60s,

00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:55.990
you have to break it down.

00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:59.410
In other words, you have to
speak without losing meaning,

00:51:59.410 --> 00:52:02.270
without losing content,
you have to explain it

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:04.640
in a language that
they understood.

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.940
And I think one of the
things that we try to do

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.320
in the opinions is to
explain things to people.

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.860
I think we owe it to people.

00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:16.670
In order to do that,
we have to know it,

00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:18.410
as we do in the classes.

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:20.730
Look at the eyes on the
students when we're done.

00:52:20.730 --> 00:52:25.010
When they figure out that they
know more about Lockner now

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.210
than they did before, simply
because we read the briefs

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.400
and articles about
it, et cetera,

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.610
and we know the story behind it.

00:52:32.610 --> 00:52:34.100
And all of a sudden
they can claim it.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:35.400
They understand it.

00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:37.140
It makes sense.

00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:39.200
If you look -- when
I wrote separately

00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.850
in the McDonald opinion,
what I was trying to do is,

00:52:42.850 --> 00:52:46.230
after all this talk of
substantive due process,

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.060
just simply explain to people,
we don't know where it --

00:52:49.060 --> 00:52:50.360
where does it come from?

00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:51.960
Where does it come from?

00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.600
It's not in the constitution.

00:52:53.600 --> 00:52:57.490
So you go back and you
say, here is what is there.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:58.790
You don't have to agree.

00:52:58.790 --> 00:53:01.870
But the immunity clause
is actually there.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:04.050
Here is what they
actually debated.

00:53:04.050 --> 00:53:05.980
You can disagree with that.

00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:08.840
But you can see the coherence.

00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:13.990
You can see -- you can go to
Dred Scott and you can see --

00:53:13.990 --> 00:53:17.480
you know, like Tawney
says, can't be citizen,

00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:20.280
remedied in the 14th amendment.

00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.030
And you can't deny citizenship.

00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:29.410
It makes sense once you
go through the history.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.220
That's what I tried
to do in the opinions.

00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:34.180
It's not so much to give
you some legal theory

00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:36.990
but to give you the
progress of this provision.

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:39.900
And then to show you where
it's connected to some

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:42.760
of the other concerns
they had about blacks

00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:46.290
in the south being able
to defend themselves.

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:47.590
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: Justice,

00:53:47.590 --> 00:53:48.890
I wish we could stay
all afternoon.

00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:50.190
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
Well, they're leaving,

00:53:50.190 --> 00:53:51.490
but you and I can stay.

00:53:51.490 --> 00:53:52.790
[ Laughter ]

00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:54.490
&gt;&gt; GREGORY MAGGS: I've gotten
the signal that time is up.

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.610
Thank you for your remarks.

00:53:56.610 --> 00:53:57.910
&gt;&gt; CLARENCE THOMAS:
Thank you all

00:53:57.910 --> 00:54:00.840
for spending this
afternoon with us.

00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:04.600
I'm sorry to take so
much of your time.

00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:06.960
And maybe we didn't
cover everything

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.770
that you probably wanted
us to, but we're going

00:54:08.770 --> 00:54:12.030
to be talking later on about
the dormant commerce clause

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:13.980
for those that are
interested interested.

00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.530
Thank you all very, very much.

00:54:15.530 --> 00:54:16.830
[Applause]

00:54:16.830 --> 00:54:29.600
&gt;&gt; This has been a
presentation of the Library

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:33.050
of Congress, visit
