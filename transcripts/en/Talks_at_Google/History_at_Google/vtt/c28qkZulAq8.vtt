[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.754 --> 00:00:07.170
DAVID ARMITAGE:
Thanks to everyone

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.710
for coming this morning.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.770
It's a great opportunity
to talk about the book

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.760
and remember 10 years ago,
this was an idea that found me

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.340
rather than an idea that
I was looking for myself.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.880
I was working out in Southern
California at the Huntington

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.370
Library, just in
Pasadena, in 2006-2007.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.410
You may remember if
you cast your mind back

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.590
all those years, that was at
the height of the violence

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.270
during the Iraq War after
the US-led invasion.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.240
At that moment, and I'll come
back to this in a few minutes,

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.980
there was a highly
political debate

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.920
about what to call the
conflict in Iraq at that point,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.160
whether it was an insurgency
or terrorism, or indeed,

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.350
civil war, and I was listening
to that debate on TV and radio

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.430
at that point.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.490
At the same moment that
I was reading some papers

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:00.000
in the Huntington Library from
the 19th century in the middle

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.730
of the US Civil
War by a man called

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.219
Francis Lieber, whose name may
not spark many associations

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.010
for most of you, but
he is truly important,

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.090
because he produced the first
codification of the laws of war

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.310
in the middle of
the US Civil War

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.860
that became the basis of the
Hague Conventions and Geneva

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.360
Conventions later on.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.630
And as I was listening to this
very tense debate about what

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.110
to call the war in Iraq, I was
reading his letters where he

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.050
was having exactly the same
problem about what to call

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.010
the violence in North America--
in the United States--

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.960
in 1862, 1863.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.100
Was it an insurrection?

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.480
Was it a rebellion?

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.410
Was it a civil war?

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.450
What was a civil war?

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.730
He was having real
trouble sorting that out,

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.930
and I thought, OK.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.650
Here are two data points,
one from the 1860s,

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.140
one from the early
2000s, about struggles

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.350
over the meaning of civil
war and its application

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.596
to ongoing real-time
conflicts, and at that

00:01:57.596 --> 00:01:59.220
point I was searching
for a new project

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.816
and I thought,
OK, it's found me.

00:02:00.816 --> 00:02:02.190
I don't want to
write about this,

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.470
but I have to write about this.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.480
And as often happens
with historical projects,

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.250
they take much longer
than you think.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.180
So fast forward 10 years
later, and a little bit more

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.460
than that, I finally
finished the book

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.680
with a whole series
of other civil wars

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.254
up to and including Syria, and
Yemen, and the present now.

00:02:20.254 --> 00:02:22.170
So what I want to do now
in the next half hour

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.220
or so is just lead you
back through history--

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.740
through my history.

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.730
The book, "Civil Wars:
A History in Ideas"

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.940
that I ended up
writing about this,

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.370
and it was one of these stories
that took me back 2,000 years.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.720
I wasn't expecting it to
have to go back that far,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.590
but this often happens
with historical projects.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.690
You want to find out
what came before.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.590
What was the origin?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.048
What was the
beginning of the thing

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:46.650
that you're writing about?

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.600
And that's why it took
10 years to go back

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.570
2,000 years in about 250 pages.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.250
So strap on your seat belts.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.260
It's got to be a
fast ride, but I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.900
hope will get us all the
way up to the present

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.730
from ancient Rome
and give you a chance

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.670
to ask some questions about
why this history might matter.

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.710
Why knowing this
history might matter

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.460
to think about the present.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.870
So let me start, again,
a few years back.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:12.750
Many of us can remember a
moment not very long ago when

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.030
history was supposed to end.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.160
In the years after
1989, we were told

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.810
by people like Francis
Fukuyama, the free market

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.480
was going to supplant
every other form

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.180
of economic organization
around the world.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.280
Its affinity with
democracy was going

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.800
to ensure that all
other forms of politics

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.550
succumb to its advance.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.490
Globalization was
going to create

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.070
a borderless world of
unlimited prosperity

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.140
and unassailable human rights.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.080
Progress would reach
its consummation

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.180
in a utopia of perpetual
peace of the kind hoped

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.050
for by Immanuel Kant in the
late 18th century-- seems

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.180
like a very long time ago now.

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.220
As we all know, just
over a year ago,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.850
history bit back and
with a vengeance.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.920
It turns out history
was just drawing breath

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.860
before springing back
into action with ever more

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.529
unsettling energy.

00:04:00.529 --> 00:04:02.070
Protectionism, of
course, seems to be

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.830
returning to slam
globalization into reverse.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.950
The alliance between
liberalism and democracy,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.170
which we've depended on
for almost a century,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.810
seems to be coming apart at
the seams around the world

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.030
in the US and elsewhere.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.160
And the world is still obviously
not a very peaceful place.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.519
Indeed, it's a
very violent place.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.790
States, for the moment at
least, are mostly at peace

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:27.030
with each other, but
after 1989 at least,

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.960
wars within the states have
become the most widespread,

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.990
the most destructive, and
we might even say, therefore

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.010
the most characteristic form
of organized human violence

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.020
around the world.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.170
Of the nearly 50 wars now in
progress around the globe,

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:46.590
from Afghanistan to Yemen,
there were only two conflicts

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.980
in 2016, the last year for
which we have reliable figures.

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:51.960
Only two conflicts
in 2016, which

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.120
took place between two states.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.460
In this case, one between
India and Pakistan

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.860
and the other between
Eritrea and Ethiopia.

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.140
Don't worry if you don't
remember either of those.

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.330
They were both relatively
small border disputes.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.760
The one between Eritrea and
Ethiopia lasted only two days.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.940
All the rest of the wars going
on around the world in 2015,

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.620
2016, 2017, and now 2018,
started within the boundaries

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.720
of a single state.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.490
Far from what my
colleague Steven

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.160
Pinker has called "The
Better Angels of Our Nature,"

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.350
"Winning the War on War," what
we have now is a moment where

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.380
what's been called a long
peace among states now

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.450
stands under a
very dark shadow--

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.870
the shadow of civil war.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.710
The global estimate of battle
deaths in civil war since 1945

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.480
is over 25 million people.

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.680
That is about half the
estimated direct casualties

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.720
in the Second World War.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.560
Even that count doesn't
include civilians, the wounded,

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.470
the displaced, all those who
die from the knock-on effects

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.340
of civil war, such as
disease and malnutrition.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.090
Even if we look beyond the
human toll of civil war,

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.740
devastating though that's
been, to its material

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.820
and economic costs, the impact
has been no less appalling.

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.300
Think of the more than 500,000
Syrians killed in that country

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.850
since 2011.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.080
Over more than half of
that country's population,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.220
civil war has displaced
internally and externally.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.960
Civil wars cost lives--

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.090
a great many lives,
but they also

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.960
waste resources, divert spending
from welfare to warfare,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.230
disrupt economies, often
for decades, foment crime

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.020
and disease, suppressive
productivity,

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.200
and have these long-term
consequences which

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:41.030
send civil war-torn countries
backwards on every development

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:41.630
index.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.760
Not surprisingly,
development economists

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.150
have actually called civil
war "development in reverse"

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:48.380
for reason.

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:50.210
The annual price
tag for civil wars

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.120
has been estimated at
about $123 billion a year,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.020
which is roughly the equivalent
of the amount the global north

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.620
budgets for economic aid to
the global south each year.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.350
Civil war has long been
thought the most destructive

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.580
of all kinds of human conflict.

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.610
Some raw numbers
could illustrate this.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:10.140
If we take all the way
back to ancient Rome,

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.500
where we'll return
in a few minutes,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:16.430
at the height of Rome's civil
wars in the first century BCE,

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:19.700
perhaps a quarter of all
Rome's male citizens age

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.900
between 17 and 46 were in
arms during those conflicts.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.470
1,700 years later, probably
a greater proportion

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.410
of England's population
died during the civil wars

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:32.810
of the mid-17th century
than would later

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:35.460
perish in the First World War.

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.570
Two centuries later still,
the combined death toll

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:40.910
from both sides in
the US Civil War

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.180
was vastly larger relative
to the size of the population

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:47.750
at the time than the casualty
rate in the Second World War.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.350
The estimated number-- it's now
about 750,000 from both North

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:53.300
and South in the US Civil War--

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:56.960
would be equivalent to
about 7.5 million deaths

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.080
among the present-day
American population.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.500
Slaughter on a scale like
this scythed through families,

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:05.960
shattered communities,
but also shaped

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:11.542
nations and scarred imaginations
for centuries to come.

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:13.750
However, I think we should
be cautious about assuming

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:15.850
that civil war is
an inevitable, even

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.460
necessary part, of our makeup.

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:21.430
A feature, not a bug in the
software that makes us human.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.520
Some people have assumed that
we are inherently conflictual

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.980
and that civil war will
continue perpetually.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:30.040
Not perpetual peace,
but perpetual civil war.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.950
That assumption, I think,
dooms us to suffer civil war ad

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:35.740
infinitum.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:38.559
To unsettle the notion that we
are condemned to interminable

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.559
civil war, in my recent
book, "Civil Wars: A History

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:44.830
in Ideas," I've tried to
bring historical tools to bear

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.200
on the challenge of civil war.

00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:51.160
I argue that it's neither
eternal nor inexplicable.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.820
It has a history with a very
identifiable beginning, if not

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.370
yet quite a discernible end.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:01.240
What humans have invented,
they may yet dismantle.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.380
What's been created through
an effort of intellectual will

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:06.940
may be demolished
by a similar effort

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.440
of imaginative determination.

00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.210
At least, that's one of
the messages of the book.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:14.350
This book is, I believe,
the first long-range history

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.900
of civil wars from their
beginnings in Republican

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.720
Rome in the first century
BCE all the way up

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.510
to the present in South
Asia and the Middle East.

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:25.300
Over 2,000 years, as
it were, from Sulla,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:30.130
the Roman general here on the
left, to Syria in the present.

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.020
My goal in the book
is to point out

00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:34.270
the significance of
civil war in forming

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.100
the ways we think
about the world,

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.480
and especially about politics.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.570
I argue that despite
its destructiveness,

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:43.780
civil war has been throughout
history conceptually

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:45.220
generative.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.410
Without the challenges
posed by civil war,

00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:50.650
I argue our conceptions
of politics, authority,

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.860
revolution, international
law, humanitarianism,

00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:56.067
and globalization,
to name just a few,

00:09:56.067 --> 00:09:57.400
would have been quite different.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.790
Perhaps even in some
fundamental sense, poorer.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:03.430
The experience of
civil war, the efforts

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:07.510
to understand it, to mediorate
it, even to prevent it,

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:10.750
continues to inform our ideas
of community, authority,

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:14.210
and sovereignty to this day.

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.710
For those of us
lucky enough to live

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.480
under the shadow
of the long peace,

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.230
civil war is now more a
matter of memory and metaphor

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:23.970
than lived experience.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.240
However, it's seeping
into political language

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.330
and has been for some time
in the US and elsewhere.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.130
For example, just
to go back, again,

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:34.100
a few years, in
2004 then-Speaker

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.410
of the US House of
Representatives, Newt Gingrich,

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.840
described American politics
as if it were a civil war.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.760
These are his words
at that point.

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.060
"The left at its core
understands in a way

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.670
that Grant understood
after Shiloh.

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:48.650
That this is a civil war.

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.560
That only one side will
prevail and the other side

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.050
will be relegated to history."

00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:56.550
He then sketched out
the terms of the fight.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:59.960
"This war has to be fought
with the scale and duration

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.710
and savagery that is
only true of civil wars.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:06.230
While we are lucky in
this country-- in the US--

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:08.660
that our civil wars are
fought at the ballot box,

00:11:08.660 --> 00:11:11.120
not on the battlefields,
nonetheless, it

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.780
is a civil war."

00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:14.570
These words seem
almost prophetic now,

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:19.190
of course, in terms of
the political strategies

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:22.190
of both parties, especially
the Republican Party

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:24.459
and the ramping up
of violent language--

00:11:24.459 --> 00:11:26.750
the language of violence and
the incitement of violence

00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.810
that we've seen over the
past couple of years.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:31.400
Political polarization,
of course,

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.827
as many have documented, has
accelerated and deepened,

00:11:34.827 --> 00:11:36.410
and the violence of
political language

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:38.270
has sharpened along with that.

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:39.766
One could cite
many, many examples.

00:11:39.766 --> 00:11:41.390
This is just a
particularly graphic one

00:11:41.390 --> 00:11:46.700
from the battle for the
Republican nomination in 2016,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:50.072
but I could give you 100
other headlines using

00:11:50.072 --> 00:11:51.530
this language of
civil war, and you

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:54.230
can see it throughout our
political discourse now.

00:11:54.230 --> 00:11:56.610
There's even been a slew of
articles in recent months,

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:59.360
especially after the
inauguration a year ago--

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.790
the presidential inauguration
a year ago-- asking,

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:05.420
is the US heading for
another civil war?

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.970
That may be going too far, but
we should be very concerned

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.860
about this polarization,
and I think

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:11.840
we should also be
concerned about the ramping

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.080
up of that language and what
it might portend about--

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:18.920
precisely this language
of victory and violence,

00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.990
ineluctable enmity that
Gingrich and others have been

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:26.320
fomenting for many years now.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:30.870
In statements like these
about civil war in the US--

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:33.890
but I can also document this
from France, from Britain,

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:37.910
from Latin America
in recent months--

00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:41.010
one might say that democratic
politics seems increasingly

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.840
to be coming civil
war by other means.

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.690
Civil wars are therefore
everywhere now in the headlines

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.180
and on the ground,
in hearts and minds,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.430
and in commemorations
of civil wars past,

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:54.860
and in contemporary
debates, such as those

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:56.690
about removing
Confederate statues

00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:58.530
from around the country.

00:12:58.530 --> 00:13:00.230
As the Vietnamese
writer Viet Thanh

00:13:00.230 --> 00:13:04.550
Nguyen has recently written,
"All wars are fought twice.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.590
The first time on
the battlefield,

00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:08.890
the second time in memory."

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:11.870
And I think that's especially
true of civil wars.

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:13.400
Some countries
imagine themselves

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.170
to have been free of civil war.

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:16.670
Others can hardly
imagine themselves

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.890
without the memory of civil
war-- the US, of course,

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:20.040
among them.

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:22.460
And the international
community perceives still

00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:23.180
other countries--

00:13:23.180 --> 00:13:26.060
Iraq, for example-- as
a perpetual battleground

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.040
of unending civil wars.

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.260
In each case, there
seems little doubt

00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.030
among those using
the term "civil war"

00:13:32.030 --> 00:13:34.730
about what is and
is not a civil war.

00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:38.130
Everybody knows it when
they see, it we might say.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:40.170
But I think the benefit
of some history,

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:42.650
and perhaps the curse of
remembering that history,

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.420
is the knowledge that
civil war has never

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.390
been quite as stable or
transparent a category

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:51.110
as its use in popular
speech might imply.

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.450
Now I argue in the book that
more than most other forms

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:57.410
of conflict, civil wars spring
from deep and deadly divisions,

00:13:57.410 --> 00:13:59.510
but that they at
the same time expose

00:13:59.510 --> 00:14:02.210
identities and commonalities.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:05.900
To call a war civil is to
acknowledge the familiarity

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.960
of the enemies as members
of the same community--

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.775
not foreigners, but
fellow citizens.

00:14:10.775 --> 00:14:12.380
And I talk in the
book, for example,

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:15.179
about some of the
myths about civil war.

00:14:15.179 --> 00:14:16.970
Think of Cain and Abel
in the Hebrew Bible,

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:19.130
or Romulus and Remus here.

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.710
In Roman myth,
civil wars are often

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.110
cast as wars within the family--

00:14:24.110 --> 00:14:27.200
wars between brothers
like the conflict

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.930
between Romulus and Remus at the
founding of Rome, for instance.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.480
This commonality at
the heart of enmity

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.300
is key to understanding
why civil war captures

00:14:35.300 --> 00:14:39.050
the imagination, but also
why it's so terrifying.

00:14:39.050 --> 00:14:42.260
"Civil war has something
atrocious about it,"

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.820
remarked the German
legal thinker

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.190
Carl Schmitt in the 1930s.

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:49.100
"It's fraternal war
because it is conducted

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:53.420
within a common political unity,
and because both warring sides

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:57.950
at the same time absolutely
affirm and absolutely deny

00:14:57.950 --> 00:14:59.600
that common unity.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.680
That I think is one basic source
of our horror about civil wars,

00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.920
and we shouldn't underestimate
the effect of them enforcing

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.840
a recognition of commonality
amid confrontation

00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:16.460
of making us see ourselves
in the mirror of enmity."

00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.540
Civil war, I argue, has been
paradoxically fertile in part

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:23.300
because there's never been a
time when its definition was

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:25.570
settled to everyone's
satisfaction

00:15:25.570 --> 00:15:29.690
or when the term could be used
without question or contention.

00:15:29.690 --> 00:15:32.420
This is in part because it's
been disputed and debated

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:35.210
within so many different
historical contexts,

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:38.060
and I tried to reconstruct
many of those from Ancient Rome

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.502
up to the present
in the book itself,

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:42.460
and I'll give you a couple
of concrete examples

00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:43.880
in a few minutes.

00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.540
Naming, we might say,
is a form of framing.

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:50.060
The application of
the term "civil war"

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.780
can depend upon whether you're
a ruler or a rebel, the victor

00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:56.180
or the vanquished, an
established government

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:58.820
or an interested outside party.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.640
The battle over names
often continues long

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.750
after the conflict has ceased.

00:16:03.750 --> 00:16:05.969
So even now in some parts
of the US, of course,

00:16:05.969 --> 00:16:07.760
if you talk about the
Civil War rather than

00:16:07.760 --> 00:16:09.310
say "the war
between the states,"

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:11.060
you can get in trouble
over that and there

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.106
are more serious examples, for
example, in contemporary Italy.

00:16:15.106 --> 00:16:17.480
To talk about the struggle
between the Italian resistance

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.320
and the fascist
government between--

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.130
and World War II as a civil war
is still very controversial,

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.890
because it implies a
kind of moral equivalence

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.840
between the two sides.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.350
Yet how can we tell
civil wars apart

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:32.270
from other kinds of
conflict-- other kinds

00:16:32.270 --> 00:16:35.510
of wars, when so many
internal conflicts spill

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:38.090
over that country's
borders, like that in Syria,

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:40.580
or draw incompetence
from outside

00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.850
as happened in Liberia
and Rwanda in the 1990s,

00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:47.380
or in places like Iraq and
Afghanistan more recently.

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.870
Can such wars even be considered
civil in the sense of taking

00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:54.980
place among members of the same
community, when for example,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.920
insurgent groups comprise
transnational elements like

00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.590
Al-Qaeda, or Daesh, ISIS--

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:03.170
or deliberately set themselves
against the existing world

00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:05.810
order of states by
proclaiming their wish to form

00:17:05.810 --> 00:17:08.180
supranational communities,
like the caliphate

00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.099
proclaimed by ISIS.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:12.170
Is every civil war
really a specimen

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.619
of the same species when
so many distinct dynamics,

00:17:15.619 --> 00:17:17.780
ethnic conflicts,
wars of secession

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.900
and national liberation, battles
for succession and so on,

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.660
can be found across history
and around the world, all

00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.660
being called civil wars or
thought of as civil wars?

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.310
But when local
context may make it

00:17:28.310 --> 00:17:31.550
impossible to analyze
specific incidents of violence

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:34.580
as part of larger patterns
of collective action, what

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:38.120
in short is civil war?

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.750
I argue in the book that
civil war has multiple pasts.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.930
Historians like me can
show the paths not taken,

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.300
as well as the many and
winding roads by which we

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:49.490
came to the present.

00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:52.400
I call my own version of
this history "A History

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:57.260
in Ideas," investigating a
key idea or family of ideas

00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.380
in Western and ultimately
global political arguments

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.390
in their multiple
historical contexts--

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:05.540
again, from Ancient Rome to the
modern Middle East and South

00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.800
Asia.

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:09.800
In the course of the book, I
identify three major turning

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.620
points in arguments over
the meanings of civil war

00:18:12.620 --> 00:18:14.550
across those centuries.

00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:17.840
The first in the late 18th
century came at just the moment

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.570
when contemporaries needed
to distinguish civil war

00:18:20.570 --> 00:18:24.090
from another category of violent
and transformative upheaval--

00:18:24.090 --> 00:18:24.960
revolution.

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.010
And I have a chapter mostly
about the American Revolution,

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:30.860
or as it was called at the
time, the American Civil War.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:33.320
The first usage of that term
American Civil War I found

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:36.240
is in 1774, 1775.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.130
So not in the 1860s,
but in the 1770s.

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.490
The second turning point I
identify is in the mid-19th

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:46.490
century, and this occurred when
the first attempts were being

00:18:46.490 --> 00:18:51.050
made to pin down the meaning of
civil war in legal vocabulary--

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.700
an effort made
not coincidentally

00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.210
during the conflict we know as
the American Civil War of 1861

00:18:56.210 --> 00:18:58.700
to '65, and this is
where Francis Lieber, who

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:01.910
I mentioned a moment ago,
comes into the picture.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.370
The third turning point
comes during the late phases

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.950
of the Cold War, when
social scientists

00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:09.950
decided to define the
term to help them analyze

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.900
the conflicts going
on around the world

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.510
during their proxy
wars and decolonization

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:18.410
in the 1960s and 1970s, when
it was necessary to distinguish

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.070
civil wars from
anti-imperial conflicts,

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:25.700
from other forms of
collective violence

00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:28.870
in that period of turbulence.

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:31.310
Our confusions about the
meaning and the application

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.650
of civil wars to
contemporary conflicts

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.890
are the product, I argue, of
the concepts long and contested

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.490
and winding history.

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:41.210
Only with the help of history--
the tools of historian,

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:44.360
I argue, can we understand
just why its meaning remains

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:47.050
so controversial today,
and I'll come in conclusion

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:48.980
to two examples
from Iraq and Syria

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:53.870
about that contestation over
the meanings of the term itself.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:56.540
At least until the 19th century
and the great historical

00:19:56.540 --> 00:19:59.390
watershed marked by
the American Civil War,

00:19:59.390 --> 00:20:03.520
civil wars were understood as
cumulative historical phenomena

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:05.930
whose sequence gave
a shape, albeit a far

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:07.980
from comforting
shape, to the past,

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:09.590
and whose avoidance
might turn out

00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.260
to be one of the
achievements of the future.

00:20:12.260 --> 00:20:13.910
Civil war was
often an experience

00:20:13.910 --> 00:20:17.090
refracted through the prisms
of history and memory,

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:19.280
through the record
of past civil wars,

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.730
in distant times and far-flung
places, and out of fears

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:24.710
that the civil wars
in one's own country's

00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:27.770
history might indeed
repeat themselves.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.520
Victims of civil war have often
experienced it through history,

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.400
and historical
approach is therefore

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.320
a particularly appropriate
way to study its impact

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.630
and its imagery over time.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.610
Conflict over its
meaning, as well as

00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:44.120
the meaning of conflict itself,
are prime subjects, I argue,

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.980
for historical treatment.

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:48.630
To tell my story,
I break the book

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:51.810
into three parts,
each of two chapters.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.090
The first part,
"Roads from Rome,"

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:57.510
traces changing conceptions
of civil war chronologically

00:20:57.510 --> 00:21:00.510
from the first century
BCE to the fifth century

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:02.100
of the common era.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:05.550
During that period, I argue,
Roman conceptions decisively

00:21:05.550 --> 00:21:07.920
shaped arguments
about civil war--

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.380
about its normative
and legal definition,

00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:13.380
about how to recognize a civil
war when it was going on,

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.150
about where it came from, about
whether it was likely to recur,

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:19.350
and what could be
done to prevent it.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.487
"All roads lead from
Rome," I argue in the book,

00:21:22.487 --> 00:21:24.570
and there's a controversial
part of the book where

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.900
I decide not to
start with Greece,

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.760
and [INAUDIBLE] we could
talk about that afterwards,

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.260
but I make a strong
argument that it

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:36.090
was the Romans who invented
civil war, not the Greeks.

00:21:36.090 --> 00:21:38.740
The Romans knew that the Greeks
had a conception of conflict,

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.550
which was very different from
their conception of civil war,

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:43.962
and even Greek-speaking
authors at the time

00:21:43.962 --> 00:21:46.170
knew there was a difference
between their conceptions

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:49.170
of conflict as well.

00:21:49.170 --> 00:21:51.330
Civil war, I argue,
was not a fact

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.310
of nature waiting
to be discovered.

00:21:54.310 --> 00:21:56.250
It was an artifact
of human culture

00:21:56.250 --> 00:21:59.190
that had to be
invented, and I argue,

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.580
the invention of civil war is
only a little over 2,000 years

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:07.530
old, and it can be dated back
to the first century BCE.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.420
The first people to
understand their acts

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.070
of collective violence as both
civil and war were the Romans.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:17.160
This was because they understood
their most wrenching conflicts

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:21.390
in definitively political terms,
as conflicts among citizens.

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:23.640
The Latin word for
citizens is "cives."

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.650
C-I-V-E-S. The root from
which we get the word "civil"

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:32.460
as well as "civility,"
"civilization," and "civilian,"

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.610
and they saw these conflicts
among citizens-- among "cives"

00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:39.540
and civil conflicts as
rising to the level of war,

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.150
rather than being riots,
rebellions, or seditions,

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:43.740
for instance.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.930
What's peculiar
about the way Romans

00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:49.080
thought about war is they
named their conflicts

00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.080
by the enemy they were fighting
rather than the place where

00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.610
the war was fought,
so they talked

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.950
about a civil war
in the same way

00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:58.800
that they talked about, say, a
war against the African leader

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.870
Jugurtha as the Jugurthine War.

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.990
We often talk about
wars as the places

00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:06.150
where they take place--
the Pacific War.

00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:08.820
Even the World
Wars, we might say

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:11.880
are defined according to
their place-- the Vietnam War.

00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:14.750
We don't tend to talk about
them as in terms of enemies.

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.500
At least, we don't
talk about the Iraq War

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.060
as the Suddamic War.

00:23:18.060 --> 00:23:20.760
That would be the Roman way of
talking about that conflict,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.260
for instance.

00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:24.360
The Romans adopted
this idea of civil war

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:26.020
very reluctantly at first.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:28.740
For a long time, they used
it only with trepidation,

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.770
and it still takes, I think, a
feat of historical imagination

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:35.260
to recall just why civil war
was originally so disturbing

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.347
and named only with fear.

00:23:37.347 --> 00:23:39.180
We can see this most
graphically in the case

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.370
of that famed civil
warrior, Julius Caesar, whom

00:23:41.370 --> 00:23:44.010
you can see here in a
19th century rendering.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:47.910
He narrated his power struggle
with the Roman General Pompey

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.130
in an unfinished work
now generally known

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.130
as "The Civil War,"
"Caesar's Civil War."

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:55.380
However, that title was
not Caesar's, and he

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.710
did all he could to avoid using
the phrase in his own text.

00:23:58.710 --> 00:24:01.710
For Caesar, as for
many Romans, civil war

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:05.280
remained the war that
dared not speak its name.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.980
Yet, though it would turn out
to be an enduring and disturbing

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.170
strain of Roman
history that suggested

00:24:10.170 --> 00:24:13.680
a tight relationship between
civil war and civilization

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:14.760
itself.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.220
Civil wars, the
Romans began to argue,

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.310
came back so often across the
history of the Roman Republic

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:22.900
and into the early decades
of the Roman Empire

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.650
that they appeared to be
woven into the fabric of Roman

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.130
public life.

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.240
This created a set of
narratives of a civilization

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:33.000
prone to civil war,
even in some sense

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.750
cursed by civil war that
would last for centuries

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:39.420
and inform later
understandings of civil war

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.960
across the early modern and
modern periods and beyond.

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.480
Indeed, I argue in the book,
that for more than a millennium

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.730
and a half, civil
war would be viewed

00:24:47.730 --> 00:24:51.160
through Rome-tinted spectacles.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.260
As I show in the second
part of the book,

00:24:53.260 --> 00:24:56.650
"Early Modern Crossroads,"
those Roman explanations

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:59.560
and their narratives
provided the repertoire

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.060
from which later
thinkers in Europe

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:03.460
between the 16th and
the 18th centuries

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.280
drew their own
conceptions of civil war.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.610
Since the Enlightenment
of the 18th century,

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.420
two conceptual clusters--

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.840
on the one hand civil war,
and the other revolution--

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.330
would be tied to each other
but also pulled apart from each

00:25:16.330 --> 00:25:19.780
other, rather like this image of
sedition from the 17th century,

00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.780
With quite distinct moral
and political implications,

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.270
civil wars were
increasingly thought

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:29.830
of as backward-looking,
destructive, and regressive,

00:25:29.830 --> 00:25:33.100
while revolutions came to be
thought of as future-oriented,

00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.530
fertile, and progressive.

00:25:35.530 --> 00:25:38.200
Successful civil wars, like
the American Revolution,

00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.170
would be rebranded
as revolutions.

00:25:41.170 --> 00:25:43.330
Revolutionaries would
later deny they'd ever

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.670
been engaged in civil wars.

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.260
We can, I think,
therefore perform

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.410
a kind of conjugation-- a
political conjugation here.

00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:52.210
I am a revolutionary.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:53.800
You are a rebel.

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.740
They are engaged in a civil war.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.080
The third part of the book,
"Past of the Present,"

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.840
traces the conceptual
heritages of Civil War

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.660
from the era of the US
Civil War to our own time

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.820
in the early 21st century.

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:10.760
I argue again that the 19th
century's great contribution

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.840
to the history of
ideas of civil war

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.200
was the attempt to
civilize it by bringing it

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.350
under the domain of law,
beginning, again as I mentioned

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:21.950
earlier, with the first modern
codification of the Laws of War

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.070
by the Prussian, later American,
lawyer and political scientist,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:27.770
Francis Lieber in
the 1860s, and then

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.980
later in the various revisions
to the Geneva Conventions

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:33.590
after the start of
the Second World War.

00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:36.530
Civilizing civil war,
as we might call it,

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:39.080
remains a task for the
international legal community

00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:41.120
right down to our own time.

00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.720
The roots of their concerns
and the tension civil wars

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.430
have raised within
what we now call

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.299
international
humanitarian law are

00:26:48.299 --> 00:26:50.090
the subject of the
latter part of the book,

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:52.340
and I'll illustrate
that in just a moment

00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:55.880
by talking about the origins
of the use of the term

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:59.820
civil war in relation to
Syria a few years ago.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:02.480
In this latter part of the
book, I trace developments

00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.970
as civil war goes global across
the course of the 20th century,

00:27:05.970 --> 00:27:08.450
especially in the period
after the Second World War

00:27:08.450 --> 00:27:10.430
and into the Cold War.

00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:11.900
The boundaries of
the communities--

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.720
the thinkable, imaginable
communities within which

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:17.090
civil wars took place,
expanded beyond those

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:20.030
of states and empires
in this period

00:27:20.030 --> 00:27:22.490
to encompass the whole
world in a conception

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:27.680
of global civil war found
originally in the early 1960s.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:31.040
For example, John F. Kennedy,
in his second State of the Union

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.410
Address, spoke of
the Cold War itself

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:37.730
as quotes, "A global civil war
that has divided and tormented

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.320
mankind."

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:41.870
That expansion of the community
within which civil war could

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.300
take place has, I
argue, deep roots

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.130
in various strains
of cosmopolitan

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.700
thought which had long suggested
that all wars among humans

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.350
were, in fact,
civil wars, and this

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:55.550
led to a strain of
pacifism to try and prevent

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:59.720
civil wars taking place
within a common humanity.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.660
Yet that expansion also collided
with the late 20th century

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.270
effort, which I mentioned
a moment ago, beginning

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.210
in the Cold War by
social scientists

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:11.000
to bring some conceptual clarity
to the study of civil war,

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.430
starting in the 1960s.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.371
In that period, in
particular in a project then

00:28:17.371 --> 00:28:18.870
at the University
of Michigan called

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:20.900
the "Correlates
of War Project--"

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.790
it was necessary to begin to--

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.640
not just to codify
but actually to code

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:28.880
particular forms of
conflict, their occurrences,

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.280
their recurrences,
the time they took,

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:34.040
their origins, their
causation, in order

00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:36.865
to do long-end studies,

00:28:36.865 --> 00:28:40.250
Large-end studies of
conflicts around the world

00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:43.610
to try and determine some
of their common features.

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:45.980
And it was in the
context of that effort

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.920
that the first detailed
definitions of civil war

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.070
were produced, which continue
to be used today, not just

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.770
by data scientists studying
conflict around the world,

00:28:55.770 --> 00:28:59.120
but also are used by
international organizations,

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.620
like the World
Bank, for instance

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.540
and their determinations
of the boundaries

00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.970
between different
forms of conflict.

00:29:04.970 --> 00:29:06.950
I argue in the book,
teasing out some

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.520
of the examples of these usages,
that these early attempts

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.700
to define civil war were
in some sense doomed,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:16.130
because civil war is such
a slippery political and

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.150
ideological concept.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:21.710
The sedimented history of--

00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.620
conceptual history of
civil war going back

00:29:24.620 --> 00:29:27.170
to the Roman Republic,
layered over since then

00:29:27.170 --> 00:29:30.080
with these languages of
law and social science,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.320
has given rise to complexity in
our own current understanding

00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.420
of civil war, which
I'd like to illustrate

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:38.720
just now in conclusion with
those two examples I mentioned

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:42.140
earlier-- one from Iraq where
this book began, and then

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.200
the more recent
example from Syria.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.630
After talking about each
of those very briefly,

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:50.570
I'll try and draw together the
threads of this talk and indeed

00:29:50.570 --> 00:29:52.922
of my book by giving
a few lessons,

00:29:52.922 --> 00:29:54.380
including a little
bit of hope that

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:58.080
might emerge from what otherwise
seems like a rather dark story.

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:01.040
So let's go back to
Iraq just for a second.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:04.010
At the height of the
violence in Iraq,

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.420
in 2006-2007, over
3,000 people a month

00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.170
were dying in that country.

00:30:10.170 --> 00:30:13.040
And as I mentioned before, there
was a vehement disagreement

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.830
that the category-- whether
the category of civil war

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:19.700
could in fact be used to fit
the facts on the ground in Iraq.

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.150
Representatives of the
George W. Bush administration

00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:25.550
at that time and other mostly
right wing military strategists

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:28.760
and political pundits denied
that the turbulence in Iraq

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.740
merited the name of civil war.

00:30:30.740 --> 00:30:33.770
Perhaps it was terrorism
or insurgency, but not

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.630
a civil war, they argued.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:37.940
For many inside
and outside Iraq,

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:39.620
there could, in fact,
be no doubt what

00:30:39.620 --> 00:30:41.580
was happening at that point.

00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.840
For example, the then U.N.
Secretary General, Kofi Annan,

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.750
told the BBC in
late 2006, "When we

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:50.390
had strife in Lebanon
and other places,

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.040
we call that a civil war.

00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:55.100
What's happening now
in Iraq is much worse."

00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:57.860
At the same time, various
sectors of US media

00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:01.250
began calling the conflict
in Iraq a civil war.

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:04.270
Adel Ibrahim, a young
Shiite sheik from Iraq

00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:06.770
vehemently told the "New
York Times" at that moment,

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.540
"You need to let the
world know there's

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:10.460
a civil war here in Iraq.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:12.260
It's a crushing civil war.

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:17.180
We don't know who our enemy
is and who is our friend."

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:19.010
Quite predictably,
there was adamant

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.990
disagreement that
the label "civil war"

00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:23.480
did, in fact, fit
the facts in Iraq.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:27.710
In December 2006, then-Iraqi
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.510
briskly rejected
characterization

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.360
of the conflict as a civil
war and accused Kofi Annan

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.510
among others of burnishing
the image of Saddam Hussein

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.610
as a viable belligerent.

00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:41.450
Various other
commentators, indeed using

00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:45.200
the social scientific
definitions of civil war,

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.090
went back and forth about
whether it really applied

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.340
to what was happening in Iraq.

00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.830
In one case, two
commentators, including

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:55.130
the very eminent British
military historian, Sir John

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.130
Keegan, worked out that since
the middle of the 17th century,

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:01.490
there had in fact been only
five civil wars in the entirety

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.910
of human history--

00:32:02.910 --> 00:32:06.230
the English Civil War of the
1640s, the American Civil War,

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:08.870
the Russian Civil War,
the Spanish Civil War,

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:10.730
and the Lebanese Civil War.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:13.070
And in that sense and for
that reason, they argued,

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:14.570
what was happening
in Iraq could not

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.870
be described as the
world's sixth civil war.

00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:21.230
Instead, they proposed, that
quotes, "The disorders in Iraq

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.490
do not constitute a
civil war," but are

00:32:23.490 --> 00:32:26.870
nearer to what they termed
a politico-military struggle

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:29.540
for power, whatever that may be.

00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:32.030
Now the Iraqi government at
the time and representatives

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.920
of the Bush
Administration officially,

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.340
formally denied that Iraq
was in the grip of civil war.

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.390
To admit that it was might
imply that the government there

00:32:40.390 --> 00:32:43.010
had lost its authority,
and it also entailed

00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:46.190
a bevy of strategic indications
for the US-led coalition

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:47.330
forces.

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.030
If it were a civil war, that
would mean deciding which side,

00:32:50.030 --> 00:32:52.820
Sunni or Shiite, for
example, the coalition

00:32:52.820 --> 00:32:56.150
should support as it made its
bets on an internal struggle

00:32:56.150 --> 00:32:56.750
for dominance.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.583
That was one of the
implications of thinking

00:32:58.583 --> 00:33:00.920
of this as civil, internal war.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.560
It could also imply that
the invaders from outside

00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:08.240
had unleashed sectarian enmities
that previously had no outlet

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.790
and that events were
spinning out of control.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:14.009
If such instability continued,
then much higher troop levels

00:33:14.009 --> 00:33:15.800
would be needed to
prevent it from spilling

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.820
over Iraq's borders.

00:33:17.820 --> 00:33:20.510
Alternatively, a rapid
but undignified withdrawal

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.330
might be necessary to avoid
being drawn ever deeper

00:33:23.330 --> 00:33:26.270
into indigenous dilemmas, which
an alien presence would only

00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:27.830
inflame but not resolve.

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:30.290
So calling it an
insurgency or terrorism

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.230
ramped it down,
turned any attempts

00:33:33.230 --> 00:33:37.100
to fight it into police actions,
and threw the responsibility

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.910
for those police actions onto
the then-Iraqi Administration,

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.210
not onto the coalition forces.

00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:48.200
Let's fast-forward just a few
years to the conflict in Syria

00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.780
in 2011-2012.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:55.190
Ordinary Syrians in the early
months of the war in Syria

00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:58.720
knew very well throughout 2011
and the first half of 2012

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:02.120
that what they were
experiencing with their--

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.050
in their contention with
the regime of Bashar

00:34:04.050 --> 00:34:07.190
al-Assad was indeed a civil war.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.739
Outside Syria, however,
interested parties

00:34:09.739 --> 00:34:12.260
across the globe continue
to debate whether or not it

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.929
had descended into civil war.

00:34:14.929 --> 00:34:17.239
So for example,
in December 2011,

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:19.760
White House Deputy
Spokesperson [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:23.060
demurred when asked if he
agreed with a U.N. official

00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:26.120
that Syria was experiencing
civil war at that point.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.880
"We think violence needs
to end in Syria," he said,

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:31.340
"and that includes among
opposition elements.

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.730
But there's no way to equate
the two, which in my view

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:38.230
is implied by using
the term civil war."

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.730
Now of course at that
moment, Assad's regime

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:42.679
saw only rebellion.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.389
The opposition at
that point said

00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:46.270
they were engaged in
resistance against him--

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:48.889
even revolution
against him, and powers

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:50.659
like Russia and
the United States

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.510
held the threat of a civil
war over each other's heads

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.330
as they jousted
over intervention

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:57.860
and nonintervention.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.790
Now importantly
for our purposes,

00:34:59.790 --> 00:35:02.300
it took the International
Committee of the Red Cross

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.580
until July 2012--

00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:07.310
more than a year into
the conflict in Syria

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:11.510
and after as many as 17,000
people had already died--

00:35:11.510 --> 00:35:15.680
to confirm that what was taking
place in Syria was in fact

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.100
a civil war, or to use the
technical language of the Red

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:22.610
Cross and of other
international organizations,

00:35:22.610 --> 00:35:26.600
now the official term
is "armed conflict not

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.510
of an international
character," or N-I-A-C--

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:32.060
NIAC, which is the
official legal term

00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:35.570
from international humanitarian
law for a civil war.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:39.996
Only when the Red Cross had made
that determination in July 2012

00:35:39.996 --> 00:35:41.870
would it be possible
for the relevant parties

00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:45.470
to be covered by the specific
provisions of the Geneva

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.120
Conventions, for instance.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:49.010
Also for things like
humanitarian aid

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.890
to be taken into the country.

00:35:51.890 --> 00:35:53.910
The reluctance to
call the conflict

00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:56.870
a civil war non-international
armed conflict has,

00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:59.410
in fact, become typical of
international organizations

00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:03.040
in the 21st century,
because now so much

00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.310
politically, militarily,
legally, and ethically

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.430
hangs on the use or withholding
of the term civil war,

00:36:09.430 --> 00:36:12.260
or again, non-international
armed conflict.

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:14.320
In fact, a set of legal
protocols going back

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:17.470
to the Geneva Conventions
and ultimately to Francis

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:19.900
Lieber's codification of the
laws of war in the mid-19th

00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.810
century--

00:36:20.810 --> 00:36:22.330
those legal protocols
were designed

00:36:22.330 --> 00:36:25.330
to humanize the
conduct of civil war,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:28.600
to bring to bear humanitarian
constraints on its practice,

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:32.050
to minimize some of the terrible
human costs of civil conflict,

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:35.230
but they've often served to
constrain international actors

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.450
in their attitudes towards
conflicts in countries

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.970
like Syria in the present.

00:36:39.970 --> 00:36:42.910
Now as these examples of
Iraq and Syria reveal,

00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:45.310
there's no agreement at
the moment about just which

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:47.830
features of civil war
should take priority

00:36:47.830 --> 00:36:50.440
and its various
definitions, nor is there

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.940
any agreement about
the way in which

00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.420
they might be assigned
normatively or even legally

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.430
to specific conflicts.

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.080
Being precise in
the sense of using

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.600
clear definitions of
civil war turns out

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.110
to be inescapably
political and ideological.

00:37:05.110 --> 00:37:07.840
The elements of the various
definitions of civil war,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.090
as much as their application
to particular conflicts,

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.630
are always matters for
principled dispute,

00:37:13.630 --> 00:37:16.630
and this seems to be especially
true in the case of civil war--

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:18.370
an essentially
contested concept,

00:37:18.370 --> 00:37:23.370
we might say, about essential
elements of contestation.

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:25.110
Now a philosopher,
a lawyer, perhaps

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.320
even a political scientist,
might find only confusion

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.470
in these kinds of wranglings
over the term civil war.

00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:33.990
However, historians--
a historian like me--

00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:36.320
sense an opportunity.

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.920
The historians'
task, I think, is not

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:40.350
to come up with a better
definition of civil war

00:37:40.350 --> 00:37:42.120
on which all sides could agree.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.570
I think that's a
doomed enterprise

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:47.250
as the history shows,
but instead to ask where

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:50.739
these competing conceptions
came from, what they've meant,

00:37:50.739 --> 00:37:52.530
how they arose from
the experience of those

00:37:52.530 --> 00:37:54.450
who lived through
civil war, or who

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:56.160
attempted to understand
it in the past

00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:57.960
and indeed into the present.

00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.030
The stakes are now
very high indeed

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.930
for applying or withholding
the label "civil war"

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.240
to a conflict, and
it's unlikely, I think,

00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.330
that politics can ever be
eliminated from its definition

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:11.130
or its application.

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.200
Like the term "genocide"
with which it's closely

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:15.480
linked the 20th
century, civil war

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:18.150
has not only political
connotations, but also

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:22.020
legal implications that can
trigger concern and action--

00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:25.590
even intervention from the
international community.

00:38:25.590 --> 00:38:28.050
Over the course of
2,000 years, I argue,

00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:32.270
civil war has been subject to
similar disputes and divisions,

00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:34.980
and there's never been a time
when its definition was settled

00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.620
to everyone's satisfaction,
or when it could be used

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.867
without question or contention.

00:38:40.867 --> 00:38:42.950
Let me just conclude in
the last couple of minutes

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.491
with some reflections
on what I think

00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:47.180
are the purposes or the
outcomes of this reflection

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:48.930
that I've made in the
book, and then tried

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:52.130
to elaborate a little
of here this morning.

00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.200
I believe that a long
view of civil war, going

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.480
over 2,000 years in
the way that I've done

00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.280
can encourage three things--

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:02.240
humility, complexity,
and indeed, hope.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.370
Humility first,
because we can see

00:39:04.370 --> 00:39:07.400
that much of what we think
we now know about civil wars

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.500
was in fact discovered
centuries-- even

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:11.670
in some cases millennia ago.

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:13.880
Social scientists
who study civil war

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.540
tell us that civil wars last
longer, recur more often,

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:20.430
and leave deeper wounds than
other kinds of conflict.

00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:22.070
However, the Romans
had discovered

00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:24.870
all of that during their own
civil wars in the first century

00:39:24.870 --> 00:39:28.820
BCE, and in their reflections
over five centuries

00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:31.460
of civil war from
the time of Cicero

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.980
up to the time of St. Augustine.

00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:35.900
Secondly, complexity.

00:39:35.900 --> 00:39:37.580
Complexity because
of our struggles

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.340
over the meaning and
significance of civil war

00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:43.880
arise from multiple and
layered histories that jostle

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:46.040
and collide in the present.

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:48.170
Controversies over the
meaning of civil war

00:39:48.170 --> 00:39:50.150
arise from those
multiple histories,

00:39:50.150 --> 00:39:53.260
which I believe need to be
carefully excavated, as I've

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:54.980
tried to do in
the book, in order

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.750
to properly understand them.

00:39:56.750 --> 00:40:00.500
And then finally, hope, or at
least a somewhat tempered hope.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:03.080
The long view shows
that civil war is not

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:06.860
a congenital curse for humanity,
but an affliction that perhaps

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.690
one day we might gradually cure.

00:40:09.690 --> 00:40:11.900
The incidence of civil
conflict indeed now

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:13.700
seems to be declining.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.400
Major civil wars, for example,
the Civil War in Sri Lanka

00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:21.180
which lasted more than 25 years,
and the Civil War in Colombia,

00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:23.660
which lasted even
longer-- over 50 years--

00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:25.700
have lately been
terminated after decades

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:27.920
of death and destruction.

00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.800
At the moment, the
entire Western hemisphere

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.520
of the Americas is free of civil
war for almost the first time

00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.650
in two centuries.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:38.600
Perhaps we might
see this as a sign

00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:42.200
that humanity is at last on
the verge of un-inventing

00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:46.250
what the Romans had first
invented over 2,000 years ago.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.670
Until we can un-invent,
un-imagine civil war,

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:52.940
we need history, I believe, and
a very long view of history,

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:56.270
to assess the future prospects
for escaping one of our most

00:40:56.270 --> 00:40:58.190
destructive discontents.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:59.500
Thank you very much.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:06.840
AUDIENCE: Not sure this
is exactly on topic,

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.790
but sort of keys off of it--

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:14.530
you know, conflicts of
ideas are part of humanity

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:18.670
and they don't always
lead to armed conflict,

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.060
and obviously sometimes
they do, and I think

00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:23.590
all of the civil wars that--

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.540
whether you call
it that or not--

00:41:25.540 --> 00:41:28.210
come down to that, and--

00:41:28.210 --> 00:41:32.440
including in this
country over slavery.

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:35.200
Is there any
pattern that you can

00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.120
say that-- in which
the conflict of ideas

00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.780
is ultimately going to
lead to armed conflict?

00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.882
And sometimes I worry
about current-day America.

00:41:41.882 --> 00:41:42.840
DAVID ARMITAGE: Mm-hmm.

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:43.280
Mm-hmm.

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:43.780
Yep.

00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:45.730
No, it's a very pointed
and timely question.

00:41:45.730 --> 00:41:49.330
One of the lessons that I
learned from examining--

00:41:49.330 --> 00:41:51.190
earlier examinations
of civil war,

00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:55.600
which are always retrospective,
either during the midst

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:58.360
of a conflict, after it's ended,
or when people are afraid it's

00:41:58.360 --> 00:41:59.812
going to come back again.

00:41:59.812 --> 00:42:02.020
And this is true going all
the way back to the Romans

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:04.540
and you can see it endlessly
repeated all the way

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:07.750
into the 20th century, is the
sense that you never quite know

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:12.220
when a civil war is going to
begin, or when it has begun,

00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:15.340
so there's never a formal
declaration of war.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.440
There's rarely a
specific moment when

00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:20.440
you can say ah, that's
when the civil war began.

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.360
But particularly the
Romans started doing this

00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:28.000
and then others followed them in
digging back into the fissures

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:34.930
within society, the ethical
disputes, the poisoned language

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:39.010
which had led to the first
signs, the first glimmerings

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:39.707
of civil war.

00:42:39.707 --> 00:42:41.290
And one of the lessons
that came out--

00:42:41.290 --> 00:42:43.320
comes out of so many of
those earlier treatments

00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:47.830
is it's often language itself
which is the first sign,

00:42:47.830 --> 00:42:52.480
even before you have
swords, or you have guns,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:54.760
or you have any
armed conflict, it's

00:42:54.760 --> 00:43:00.010
the eruption of bitterly
divisive language,

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:05.830
the politicization of
commonality into enmity--

00:43:05.830 --> 00:43:10.540
the very language of civil war
itself being used in conflict

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.870
long before anybody is
actually holding swords

00:43:13.870 --> 00:43:15.640
to each other's throats
or pointing guns

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:17.470
at each other's heads.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.260
And that may be one
reason for your anxiety--

00:43:20.260 --> 00:43:23.180
my anxiety, as well,
that there has been,

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:25.300
I think, a
discernible ramping up

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:29.020
of that language of civil
war in American politics,

00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.310
not just referring back
to the US Civil War

00:43:31.310 --> 00:43:35.120
as a an image of
what might happen,

00:43:35.120 --> 00:43:37.270
but talking about politics
itself is something

00:43:37.270 --> 00:43:39.670
which is a fight to the death--

00:43:39.670 --> 00:43:43.450
ineluctable enmity,
totally divided sides--

00:43:43.450 --> 00:43:46.430
which can have no
communication with each other.

00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:48.160
I don't actually think
we're at the point

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:52.600
of open civil war in the sense
of armed conflict, but one--

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:55.960
I'm very disturbed by that
sense that the language

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.080
is ramping up.

00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.080
This has often been
seen for 2,000 years

00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.230
to be a symptom of division
that leads to civil war,

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.690
and when you have that ramping
up of violent language.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:06.520
And indeed, the
incitement of violence

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.220
by some of our politicians
in a country which

00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:15.590
has such easy access to so
many weapons, it's inevitable,

00:44:15.590 --> 00:44:17.680
I think, or we might fear
that it's inevitable--

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:20.260
will be some conflicts
coming out of this

00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:22.210
even if it's not the
kind of armed arrays

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:24.980
that we imagine from the
US Civil War, for instance.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:26.620
So we should be
very wary and very

00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:30.650
careful in our use
of this language,

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:32.490
but also in watching
that language

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.240
and seeing where it's
erupting, because it

00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.330
can be one of the very
first seeds or signs

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:41.770
of incipient conflict of a
much more destructive kind.

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:45.070
AUDIENCE: So following up
on sort of a similar note,

00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:47.350
the '60s seemed like
a pretty crazy time,

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:50.050
although I wasn't there.

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:52.210
And I was wondering
if you could maybe

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:54.870
contrast that a little
bit when you're talking

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.760
about really divided societies.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:45:02.650
And then also sort of
related to that is the--

00:45:02.650 --> 00:45:04.570
from what I remember
from my history classes,

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.490
the '60s were not
crazy just in the US,

00:45:06.490 --> 00:45:09.050
but also in Europe
and elsewhere.

00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:16.570
And similarly, not just was
there a civil war in Syria,

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:20.050
but the broader Arab
Spring seemed to be-- all

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.370
came about at a time, and
then we're seeing here

00:45:24.370 --> 00:45:28.150
with the rise of populism
in Europe and America,

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:32.530
it's sort of in a similar
timescale as the Arab Spring.

00:45:32.530 --> 00:45:37.480
I wonder if there's like
global linkage to this.

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.580
DAVID ARMITAGE: Mm-hmm.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:41.740
Yeah, that-- and we could even
pull the focus out further

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:44.845
and say you can go back to
the late 18th century where

00:45:44.845 --> 00:45:46.810
there's a wave of
revolutions across the globe,

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:49.510
the middle of the 19th century,
the spring time of nations

00:45:49.510 --> 00:45:52.690
in 1848, the period after
the First World War--

00:45:52.690 --> 00:45:54.670
Especially with
anti-colonial revolts,

00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:56.740
and then coming back
up to the 1960s,

00:45:56.740 --> 00:46:01.540
the simultaneity of student
revolt across the world

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.600
in 1968, and the
intercommunication among

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.630
student groups and other
disaffected groups at that

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:11.410
point, in the context
of decolonisation,

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:16.070
anti-imperial activity
during that period, as well,

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:17.590
and I think it's
not a coincidence,

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.900
this language of
global civil war--

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:24.340
it had been used a little bit
at earlier periods in the First

00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:27.900
World War and the Second World
War, but it's in the '60s.

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:31.510
That term "global civil war"
really comes to the fore sense

00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:36.250
that violence and
division is being

00:46:36.250 --> 00:46:38.980
shown not just between
societies, but also

00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.750
within societies as well.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:43.990
The liberation movements
which might call themselves

00:46:43.990 --> 00:46:48.300
in many cases resistance
or revolutionary movements

00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:52.420
were part of exactly those
kinds of larger patterns which

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:55.300
can be thought of as a
global set of fissures

00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:57.160
within humanity itself.

00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:02.090
And then if we fast-forward
to the era of the Arab Spring,

00:47:02.090 --> 00:47:08.080
and then think about the wider
context of non-state actors,

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:11.080
asymmetrical warfare,
global terrorism

00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.840
surrounding that at the same
time as well, I think again,

00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:16.060
it's significant that
language of global civil war

00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:22.390
starts coming back 2010, 2011,
2012, to describe civil wars.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:25.960
It's often used prejudicially
to describe civil wars

00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:27.560
taking internal divisions.

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.650
For example, with Islam
and spreading them

00:47:29.650 --> 00:47:31.130
onto a global scale--

00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:34.770
globalizing civil war
within a common humanity

00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:39.970
of which those internal debates
or disputes or rebellions

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.390
or resistances or revolutions
are just symptoms as well.

00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:45.820
So I think you're
absolutely right

00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.955
about those global
linkages, and again,

00:47:47.955 --> 00:47:50.080
from my point of view as
an intellectual historian,

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:52.371
I'm interested in that language
and where it comes back

00:47:52.371 --> 00:47:53.940
and what it betokens.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:55.780
But these things
are rarely isolated.

00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.280
The idea of a civil
war is something

00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.700
that's purely internal.

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.950
It was barely true
even in Ancient Rome

00:48:01.950 --> 00:48:05.140
and certainly hasn't been true
in the 19th and 20th centuries,

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.540
where now there's so
much intercommunication,

00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.560
mutual surveillance, mutual
learning among resistance

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.750
movements and
revolutionary movements,

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:16.090
and then also the fears
of those pushing back

00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.160
against those
movements-- see them

00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.500
as a kind of many-headed hydra
taking over the globe, as well.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:27.195
So those imaginations of global
civil war feed off each other

00:48:27.195 --> 00:48:30.490
and ramp up again the
divisions and the fears

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:33.550
and conspiracy theories
that come through them, even

00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.730
though they are indeed
based upon commonalities,

00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:38.350
both of resistance
and repression,

00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:40.270
and all of those
moments, whether it's

00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:42.430
late 18th century,
mid-19th century,

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:44.960
middle of the 20th century,
or the early 21st century,

00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:48.064
so there are lots of comparisons
and patterns there for sure.

00:48:48.064 --> 00:48:49.480
AUDIENCE: I'd like
to get a better

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:52.332
idea of the consequences of
labeling something a civil war.

00:48:52.332 --> 00:48:54.790
I was looking-- just looking
a little bit at the definition

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:56.950
of NIAC, Non-International
Armed Conflict--

00:48:56.950 --> 00:48:57.280
DAVID ARMITAGE: Correct, yeah.

00:48:57.280 --> 00:48:58.866
AUDIENCE: --which
Is basically seen

00:48:58.866 --> 00:49:03.760
as a very plain definition,
and there's also protocol too,

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:06.610
evidently, that states can
sign, of course, saying OK,

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:12.400
so a war between a state and
a responsibly-led armed group.

00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:16.870
So my question is
what do you see

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.895
as the legal or actual
consequences of labeling

00:49:20.895 --> 00:49:23.020
something a civil was as
opposed to something else,

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:24.550
and also maybe speak
to the difference

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:25.966
between the civil
wars and perhaps

00:49:25.966 --> 00:49:28.895
an insurrection
rebellion or revolution.

00:49:28.895 --> 00:49:29.770
DAVID ARMITAGE: Yeah.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:32.540
Yeah, and I detail some
of this more in the book.

00:49:32.540 --> 00:49:35.140
I won't go into all
of it here, but not

00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.960
all of the terms of
the Geneva Conventions

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.550
apply to conflicts which are not
of an international character,

00:49:42.550 --> 00:49:45.587
so there's some slippage
there to decide,

00:49:45.587 --> 00:49:47.170
for example, in the
case of the Balkan

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:50.620
Wars in the 1980s
and early 1990s,

00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:55.150
the debate was between whether
to call the war in Yugoslavia

00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:57.280
a non-international armed
conflict taking place

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.464
within the boundaries
of a single state,

00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:00.880
and then also the
question, did it

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.530
turn into an
international conflict

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:04.870
after say Serbia broke off?

00:50:04.870 --> 00:50:06.580
Because that would determine--

00:50:06.580 --> 00:50:09.650
that determined at that
point, for example,

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:14.080
which leaders might ultimately
be tried for war crimes, what

00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:16.210
kind of intelligence
gathering or information

00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:18.250
gathering might take
place during the conflict

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:22.180
itself to be used subsequently
for retrospective prosecutions,

00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.050
so that boundary between
international and

00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:27.580
non-international was
operative in those wars.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.510
In later conflicts,
like Syria for instance,

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.400
it has implications first
for the basic question--

00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:36.840
is this a police action
by a legitimate regime,

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.750
like the Assad regime
and other countries

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:42.030
should stay far away from that?

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:45.780
If it is determined,
as in the case of Syria

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.570
by the ICRC that
this is, in fact,

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.930
a non-international armed
conflict under Protocol Two

00:50:51.930 --> 00:50:55.440
of the Geneva Conventions,
then various other things

00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:58.770
kick in, like the ability
to take humanitarian aid in.

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.730
Also again to gather information
for potential prosecutions

00:51:02.730 --> 00:51:03.730
later on.

00:51:03.730 --> 00:51:06.360
So there are those different--
two sets of boundaries.

00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:08.580
One between non-international
and international armed

00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.310
conflicts which determine which
parts of the Geneva Conventions

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:13.410
take place, and then
the broader debate

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.620
about whether it's
an armed conflict

00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.530
in this international
legal sense at all.

00:51:19.530 --> 00:51:22.710
If not, if it's an insurrection
or rebellion, for instance--

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:24.750
that's something
which is usually

00:51:24.750 --> 00:51:30.000
determined to take place under
the rule of domestic law.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.350
There may be some possibilities
for human rights violations

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:37.020
to be used in later
prosecutions there,

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:39.730
but it's not under the
international humanitarian law,

00:51:39.730 --> 00:51:41.620
necessarily so it's--

00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:44.100
drawing those boundaries
becomes very important in terms

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.440
of what kind of relief
can be brought in,

00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.500
what sort of
[? posterior ?] political

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:53.460
or military outside powers will
take towards the conflict, what

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:56.640
the legal consequences may be
for those who are prosecuting

00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.900
it, if at the end
of the conflict

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.625
you get war crimes
trials, for instance.

00:52:03.625 --> 00:52:05.250
So there's a whole
host of implications

00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:08.520
that flow from that, and I think
that determines the reluctance

00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:11.070
of organizations
like the ICRC to make

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:14.272
that decision about
whether this is

00:52:14.272 --> 00:52:15.730
a non-international
armed conflict,

00:52:15.730 --> 00:52:18.450
because from that
will flow a host

00:52:18.450 --> 00:52:21.240
of other legal and
political consequences

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:24.810
as well, which have to be taken
into account during the course

00:52:24.810 --> 00:52:26.887
of the conflict and also
subsequently as well.

00:52:26.887 --> 00:52:29.220
Something that's observable--
I didn't mention this just

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.750
because of time, but--

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:34.020
is the way in which
non-international armed

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:42.270
conflicts, civil wars, are
actually becoming more and more

00:52:42.270 --> 00:52:45.060
conducted under international
humanitarian law,

00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:48.270
because those who might
be thought of by others

00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:52.920
as insurgents or rebels are
very keen, for obvious reasons,

00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:56.040
to get the recognition of
the international community,

00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:01.380
to have the regularization
of warfare itself,

00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.110
to give them recognition
as legitimate belligerents

00:53:04.110 --> 00:53:06.030
within those conflicts.

00:53:06.030 --> 00:53:08.280
That gives them a
military and political

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.380
and even an ethical advantage
in those conflicts as well.

00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:17.790
So we're actually seeing now at
the moment in the 21st century,

00:53:17.790 --> 00:53:20.890
greater usage of
international humanitarian law

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:24.450
in civil conflicts than had
been the-- internal conflicts

00:53:24.450 --> 00:53:26.640
than had been the case
in inter-state war,

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.870
partly for empirical reasons.

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:30.660
Most of the wars
going on are indeed

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.150
those non-international
armed conflicts,

00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:36.810
but also because there are
greater rewards for competence

00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:40.187
to comply with international
humanitarian law

00:53:40.187 --> 00:53:41.520
during those conflicts, as well.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:45.990
It's also the case
that more and more

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:49.140
internal non-international
civil wars are being concluded

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:52.530
by treaties now than any
other form of conflict,

00:53:52.530 --> 00:53:55.020
because that provides
a means for negotiating

00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:59.700
among the parties, for
clearing up some of the debates

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.840
and disputes about conduct
during the conflicts

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.640
themselves.

00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:04.950
Also for bringing in the
international community

00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:09.610
as brokers or arbitrators,
and guarantors

00:54:09.610 --> 00:54:13.170
of those international-- those
agreements among the parties

00:54:13.170 --> 00:54:14.470
as well.

00:54:14.470 --> 00:54:18.300
So in a paradoxical
way, civil war

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.940
is on the leading edge of
international humanitarian law

00:54:20.940 --> 00:54:23.790
and the civilization of
warfare more generally.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:25.920
So again, a great
deal hangs not just

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:27.900
for individual
specific conflict,

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:30.390
but also for the
future of conflict

00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:33.410
as a whole being
driven by civil war

00:54:33.410 --> 00:54:36.240
and the international armed
conflict through its pressures

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.060
on international
humanitarian law right now.

00:54:39.060 --> 00:54:39.810
Thank you so much.

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:41.101
Thanks for the great questions.

00:54:41.101 --> 00:54:43.160
[APPLAUSE]
