00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.420
It's great that we have this new equation with variable names that are more

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.684
appropriate for our situation. But this equation does look a little bit

00:00:07.684 --> 00:00:12.728
strange. We're talking about y, the amount of solution ordered. And how it

00:00:12.728 --> 00:00:16.952
depends on x, the total cost of the order. So typically, we would want y by

00:00:16.952 --> 00:00:20.201
itself on one side of the equation to show exactly how it depends on x,

00:00:20.201 --> 00:00:25.496
mathematically. If we make that happen, what will be on this other side of the

00:00:25.496 --> 00:00:26.789
equation?
