00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.510
All right, so we're almost ready to
start reading data from the firebase.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; The Firebase?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.620
&gt;&gt; Yeah, the Firebase database.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.610
You know, maybe we should all sync on
what terminology we're going to use,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.000
especially since the developer
is just joining us.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.320
It'll be good to get our language
a bit more straightened out.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.960
&gt;&gt; I was just talking to some
of the Firebase engineers in

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:17.800
the office about it.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.230
Let me go over the terminology
that they suggested.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.690
The entire Json object is what we'll
refer to as the Firebase database.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.680
Which is part of
the Firebase app back end.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.185
These here are known as keys and they're
associo on the right with values.

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:35.735
I can also call a specific
key value pair a node.

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:40.095
A key value pair that represents
a key in all the data in an analogous

00:00:40.095 --> 00:00:43.605
Java object I might also
refer to as an object.

00:00:43.605 --> 00:00:46.117
If a key value pair has
a bunch of objects inside it,

00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:48.120
such as this dodge coin key.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.350
I might call it interchangeably a list,
map or a collection.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.890
If a key holds a single value I will
refer to it as a property of a node.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.550
Each node besides the root
node has a single parent.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.830
For example, the parent of
this bit node is lite coin.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.880
Nodes can also have zero or
more children.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.510
The children of light coin are credits,
updated, ask, bid, and last.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.410
Each node is said to have a location
also called a database location

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.990
which is identified by its URL.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.790
This is the root node.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.140
This is at the root URL.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.610
&gt;&gt; Well, great, that works for me.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.310
All right, so why don't you and

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.700
me actually talk about how to read
data from the Firebase database.
