hi I'm mano marks developer advocate on

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:12.559
hi I'm mano marks developer advocate on
 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.919
hi I'm mano marks developer advocate on
the Google Maps API team this is the

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929
the Google Maps API team this is the
 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.050
the Google Maps API team this is the
third video in a series of four designed

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060
third video in a series of four designed
 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.460
third video in a series of four designed
to show you how to get started with the

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470
to show you how to get started with the
 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.010
to show you how to get started with the
Google Maps JavaScript API in the last

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020
Google Maps JavaScript API in the last
 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.050
Google Maps JavaScript API in the last
video I covered getting an API key for

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060
video I covered getting an API key for
 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.929
video I covered getting an API key for
the Google Maps JavaScript API in this

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939
the Google Maps JavaScript API in this
 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.349
the Google Maps JavaScript API in this
the video will cover using the key when

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359
the video will cover using the key when
 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.599
the video will cover using the key when
loading the JavaScript API and the

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:31.609
loading the JavaScript API and the
 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.960
loading the JavaScript API and the
basics of using the Google Maps loader

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970
basics of using the Google Maps loader
 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.850
basics of using the Google Maps loader
the Google Maps JavaScript API is loaded

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860
the Google Maps JavaScript API is loaded
 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.060
the Google Maps JavaScript API is loaded
using a script tag the basic format

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070
using a script tag the basic format
 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.080
using a script tag the basic format
looks like this you can see that there

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090
looks like this you can see that there
 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.569
looks like this you can see that there
are two parameters both required if

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579
are two parameters both required if
 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.119
are two parameters both required if
you're going to use an API key common

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129
you're going to use an API key common
 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.160
you're going to use an API key common
mistake people make is to copy and paste

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170
mistake people make is to copy and paste
 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:52.479
mistake people make is to copy and paste
this text without changing the

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489
this text without changing the
 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.630
this text without changing the
parameters the Maps API will not load in

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640
parameters the Maps API will not load in
 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.529
parameters the Maps API will not load in
this case first replace API key with

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539
this case first replace API key with
 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.170
this case first replace API key with
your API key and then set the sensor to

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180
your API key and then set the sensor to
 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.509
your API key and then set the sensor to
either true or false in most cases it

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519
either true or false in most cases it
 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.389
either true or false in most cases it
will probably be false for example look

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399
will probably be false for example look
 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.249
will probably be false for example look
at this this will pass both the key and

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259
at this this will pass both the key and
 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.529
at this this will pass both the key and
tell Google whether you are creating a

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539
tell Google whether you are creating a
 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.929
tell Google whether you are creating a
map that uses a sensor to detect the

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939
map that uses a sensor to detect the
 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:16.330
map that uses a sensor to detect the
location of the user and then on the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340
location of the user and then on the
 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.609
location of the user and then on the
sensor parameter you must set this to

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619
sensor parameter you must set this to
 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.890
sensor parameter you must set this to
true or false but it doesn't change the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900
true or false but it doesn't change the
 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.770
true or false but it doesn't change the
capabilities of the Maps API if you are

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780
capabilities of the Maps API if you are
 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.870
capabilities of the Maps API if you are
using a sensor there's no additional

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880
using a sensor there's no additional
 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.460
using a sensor there's no additional
data that you get there's no cost

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470
data that you get there's no cost
 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.039
data that you get there's no cost
associated with it and likewise if

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049
associated with it and likewise if
 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.480
associated with it and likewise if

and the controls in this example by
 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.889
and the controls in this example by
using J a would change the map to

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899
using J a would change the map to
 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.969
using J a would change the map to
Japanese we support both left to right

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979
Japanese we support both left to right
 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.649
Japanese we support both left to right
and right to left languages for instance

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659
and right to left languages for instance
 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.039
and right to left languages for instance
if you chose a R for Arabic you will see

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049
if you chose a R for Arabic you will see
 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:04.240
if you chose a R for Arabic you will see
