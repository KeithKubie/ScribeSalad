Hey everyone, thanks for tuning into test tube plus today.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.100
I'm Trace, this is episode 2 of 5 on our series about God.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.920
We take a big topic here on test tube plus and we break it

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.780
into a bunch of different chunks so we
can all understand it a bit better, myself

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.520
included, and yesterday we talked about
how God might be a real thing even under

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.400
science and how science and God might go hand in hand, but today we're gonna flip

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.439
that and we're going to talk a little
bit about how science and God might not

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
go hand in hand and scientists that
don't think that science and God can

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.320
coexist as easily as we think. So if
you're talking about scientists, one of

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.160
the first scientist you're ever gonna
think if you talk to a layman about

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.620
science is going to be Albert Einstein. Everybody knows Albert Einstein's name,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.200
everybody in the world it would seem like,
and Albert Einstein is often thought of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.920
as a religious man because he uses the
word God a lot in his writings.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.600
A handwritten letter sold for three
million dollars on eBay which clearly

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.289
states though that Einstein does not
believe in God.  In the letter, he wrote

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.989
"The word God is for me nothing more than the expression and product of human

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.350
weakness, the Bible a collection of
honorable but still primitive legends

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.960
which are nevertheless pretty childish." Some folks have issues with the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.820
translation of this message in the truth
of its validity but the letter did sell

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.860
for three million dollars on eBay so
there are people who believe that this

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.909
is a real opinion of one of the most
famous scientists ever.  Another famous

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.609
scientist, one of the most famous ones
still alive today, is Stephen Hawking.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.331
In his 1988 book "A Brief History of Time",
Hawking writes "Then we should know the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.740
mind of God."  This is something that's said a lot when it comes to Hawking, but

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.100
Mr. Hawking said during an interview "What I meant by 'we would know the mind of God'

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.640
is we would know everything that God
would know if there were a God, which

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.360
there isn't.  Also, I'm an atheist."  He was
very explicit about his opinions and he

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.430
added "Religion believes in miracles but
these are not compatible with science."  So

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.579
is there scientific proof of no god?  No, there's not, there's not any scientific

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.289
proof that there was or wasn't, as we
said before, but there is definitely room

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.730
to imagine a divine character.  Science

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.970
has not revealed why the universe came
into existence: what preceded the big

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:22.510
bang and so on and so forth. But there is
historical proof that some of the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.140
religious figures that we talk about
in relation to God existed.  But first

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.420
let's talk about one of the most famous
ones, at least here in the United States,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.030
and that is Jesus.  Jesus in the Bible,
absolutely 100%, but outside of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.670
specific religious texts from after his
death, there doesn't seem to be any

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.290
historical evidence that Jesus existed.  The Romans kept track of everything, and I do

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.470
mean everything.  They weren't a huge
empire with no organizational scheme.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.780
They had bureaucracy.  They had all of
these public buildings with records and

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.220
construction records and military
records and so on and so forth.  We know

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.690
what time of day Mount Vesuvius erupted
because there are records that survive

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.459
to this day that said so.  It was lunch time.
You think we'd have tons of stories about

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.760
a magical prophet guy who can walk on
water, come back from the dead,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.919
heal the sick, and cure the lame, but
there doesn't seem to be any verifiable

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:24.579
primary source proof of this man's
existence.  That being said, historians

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.930
would probably tell you there are a lot
of secondary sources, letters written

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.019
from people by other people to other
people,

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.900
things talking about Jesus.  But nothing
that says "Hello, I am Jesus and here is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.829
my writings."  Nothing that says "Hello this is Jesus, and me and Jesus are chillin

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:47.459
out."  Nothing that they can show as a
primary source.  I was surprised by this.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.900
I imagine you're also surprised by this if you haven't done this research before.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.500
We have tons of art and books and
documentation from before during and

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.440
after the lifetime of Jesus, if he
allegedly lived, but we don't have

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.900
anything about this very important
person.  It's debated by modern scholars and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:08.639
historians if these folks existed at all,

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:13.230
Jesus being one of a group of people who
are religiously important, because it's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.419
really hard to say a lot of religious
experience is by word of mouth and

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.380
it's very difficult to link across
references and writings from one

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.960
religious group to another or

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.690
one person to another for religious
purposes.  The only real references to Jesus

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.650
that we have are by his friends, and of
course they all wrote very positive

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.310
things.  If he was this incredible dude,
don't you think there would be counter

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.560
texts or supporting evidence or you know
evidence defaming him, especially

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:47.520
considering he was a pretty polarizing
bro.  Alternatively, Buddha is widely

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.880
agreed to be a real guy named Siddhartha
Gautama and scholars and historians all

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.389
kind of agree on this.  He probably lived
around 500 BCE, and that's before Jesus,

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.740
and there are biographies, there are
accounts, there are ancient texts, all that

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.740
cross reference to the same Siddhartha
Gautama.  He gave his people the Word of

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.800
God, so if you believe that Siddhartha
Gautama is a messiah of God or is telling

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.530
you about God, teaching you about God, and you believe he's real and what he is

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.370
saying is real, then God is real to you
for that reason, which also sheds a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.410
little more doubt on whether or not
Jesus could be in a real place.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.560
Nobody wrote about him.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.860
Muhammad has records.  Jesus doesn't.  It's very strange.  But all that aside, just because

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.880
Jesus did or did not exist does not mean
that God does or does not exist.

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.840
We're not trying to say that.  What we're trying to say is that it does cast doubt on the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.150
whole religion thing, from a scientific
standpoint.  It doesn't mean that Jesus

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.389
wasn't a prophet, wasn't a messiah, doesn't mean that Jesus was or was not anything.

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.909
What we're saying is it's
difficult to prove that he was really

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.690
there in the same way, and there are
still people working on finding that

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.650
proof, and maybe will find it someday,
maybe we'll find something interesting

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.729
in the future, but as of right now we
don't really have any primary sources.

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:15.250
So if there is no God, under science, and
there is no prophets, then why are we

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:19.050
talking about it?  Why does it dominate
the news, the culture and politics?

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.000
It does so because it incites passion in
people in the same way that science

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:28.349
insights passion in a lot of people.  It's
an impassioned argument and it's an

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:32.989
impassioned word to invoke the name of 
God when talking about something.

00:06:32.989 --> 00:06:37.160
When Hawking says "We shall know the face of God," it sounds awesome

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:42.909
and makes you wanna know that thing, but he's also not saying we'll know the face

00:06:42.909 --> 00:06:47.090
of God.  He's saying we'll know the face of this caricature and this idea, this feeling,

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.800
this emotion, and this passion.  Everyone, down in the comments, I'm sure you're already down

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.880
there typing away feverishly, but let us
know what you think down there, and

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.460
do you believe in God, do you not believe in God?  Let's continue the discussion from

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.939
yesterday's episode, and subscribe for
more test tube plus so you get tomorrow's

00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:05.169
episode as well,

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.999
more about God coming then, and if you
