00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.700
CHADE-MENG TAN: OK, Good
afternoon my friends, welcome.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.109
My name is Meng, I'm the Jolly
Good Fellow of Google.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.870
And I'm so honored and delighted
to introduce my

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.180
amazing friend, John Mackey,
co-founder and co-CEO of Whole

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.930
Foods Market.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.870
There is so much I can say
about John that I cannot

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.950
squeeze everything into a short
introduction, so I'll

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.980
just say three things.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.720
The first thing is I'm
tremendously grateful to John

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.750
for founding Whole Foods and for
setting up a store half a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.490
mile from my house
in Cupertino.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.550
So my wife and I and all our
friends-- we all love Whole

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.460
Foods, so thank you
so much John.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.770
The second thing I'd like
to say about John is how

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.490
impressively successful
John is.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.680
Under John's leadership, Whole
Foods Market grew from a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.090
single store in 1978 to a $217
billion company with more than

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.420
347 stores and 373,000
team members.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.270
John has been named Entrepreneur
of the Year,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.230
Tastemaker of the Year, one of
the best CEOs in the world,

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.520
Businessperson of the Year,
one of the most inspiring

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.750
CEOs, one of the greatest
entrepreneurs of all time, and

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.190
so on, and so forth.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.920
So just amazing, but more
important than his amazing

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.660
inspiring success is all
of good that John has

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.940
done for the world.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.900
John is a visionary and a
pioneer of the conscious

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.450
capitalism movement.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.080
He believes, and more
importantly, he demonstrates,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.660
that capitalism, when grounded
in ethical consciousness, can

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.050
be a force of good
for the world.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.660
His own company for example,
Whole Foods Market, has been

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.820
named one of the best companies
to work in for at

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.590
least 15 years.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.610
It was named America's
healthiest grocery store.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.949
It's one of the nation's top
green energy leaders.

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.770
It's one of the world's most
ethical companies and again,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.940
so on and so forth.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.240
John himself has created
initiatives to help end

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.500
poverty in developing countries,
and Whole Foods

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.370
Market was the first national
grocer to set and implement

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.700
standards for humane
animal treatment.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.120
And the list goes on and on,
all the good that he's done

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.790
for the world.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.430
And John himself receives a $1
salary and he forgoes stock

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.040
options and bonuses.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.190
And he continues to work in
Whole Foods for passion and

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.130
purpose and to make a difference
in the world.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.930
And if anybody asks,
I earn more--

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.010
my bestseller is higher than
that of the CEO of Whole Foods

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.260
and Google combined.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.280
And with that, my friends,
please welcome my

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.530
friend, John Mackey.

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.550
JOHN MACKEY: Chade-Meng, I hope
that you'll do some more

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.610
introductions for me
as I travel around

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.200
on this book tour.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.380
And I'm supposed to stay on this
blue, in this blue box.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.840
If I start to wander, somebody
tell me I've crossed over.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.010
So my first time to
visit Google--

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.980
Google's actually featured
in the book quite a bit.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.580
I consider it one of the most
conscious companies in the

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.050
world, if not the
most conscious

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.340
company in the world.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.230
And it's been very inspiring
to me personally

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.130
for a number of years.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.960
So and just having lunch
here, I'm vegan--

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.390
I got a vegan, no-oil
meal that was

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.530
tremendously delicious.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.160
I really felt like it was better
than possibly Whole

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.590
Foods Market, but I cannot
actually say-- oh my god, it's

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:59.542
going on YouTube.

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:00.898
Holy smokes.

00:04:00.898 --> 00:04:05.520
It's almost as good as
Whole Foods Markets.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.660
Anyway, I appreciate you
coming out today.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:12.040
I'm on this huge book tour,
20 city book tour,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.760
promoting our new book.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.980
My co-author, Raj Sisodia,
market professor on my book

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.529
called "Conscious Capitalism."
And I thought

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:21.534
about, I didn't actually--

00:04:21.534 --> 00:04:24.620
as I only had 20 minutes to
talk, and so mostly for Q&amp;A,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.270
so I'm not making a formal
presentation. ' But I think I

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.290
can tell you the heart and soul
of the book in 15 or 20

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.210
minutes and maybe
even less time.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.610
So the basic premise of the book
is that capitalism is the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.980
most extraordinary system of
social cooperation and value

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.670
creation that the world
has ever experienced.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:51.410
And business has a very bad
reputation in the world.

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.890
Business, the narrative about
business has basically been

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.680
captured by the enemies
of business.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.270
Business has always had enemies,
and it's mostly

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.600
intellectuals and the elites
that rule society.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.240
And business has been portrayed
as selfish and

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.030
greedy and exploitative.

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:19.050
Basically, a phenomenal
statistic like 98 to 99% of

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.600
all the murders you'll ever
seen on television or on

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.420
movies is committed by business
people, primarily

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.830
businessmen, when in fact, in
reality, of course they

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.160
produce far less than 1% of
the numbers in the world.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.360
But the greedy businessperson is
the one who, after he kills

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.440
people, he dumps his
environmental toxins in the

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:45.590
little rivers and is basically
just a horrible person.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.760
And that's how business
is portrayed.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.850
And in doing some research for
the book we found some

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:53.720
fascinating statistics,
which we talk about

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.750
in the first chapter.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.600
First of all, 200 years ago
when capitalism and the

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.800
Industrial Revolution both
began, 85% of the people alive

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.390
on the planet Earth, 85% lived
on less than $1 a day, and

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.780
that's in today's dollars,
not dollars back then.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.080
Today, it's down to 16%, which
is still too high, but if you

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.650
look at the trend lines, if
humanity continues embrace

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.990
some type of free enterprise
capitalism or some version of

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:29.260
it, we will wipe out
poverty in the 21st

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.200
century across the world.

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:33.390
People in this room, because
I'm looking at a very young

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.020
audience here, you will live
long enough to see poverty

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.120
wiped out, if humans can
keep it together.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:46.150
200 years ago, over 90% of
everyone alive was illiterate.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.280
We lived in a sea
of illiteracy.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.000
Today, it's about 12%.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.810
Just 100 years ago, there were
no universal democracies

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.820
anywhere on the planet.

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:02.340
Why?

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.050
Because women didn't have
the right to vote.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.080
Today, 50% of the countries on
our planet are universal

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.220
democracies.

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.290
150 years ago, slavery was still
legal in 14 of the 29

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.940
states in the United States.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.960
50 years ago, there was no
environmental consciousness on

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:26.520
a mass scale until Rachel
Carson's book "The Silent

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:28.620
Spring" was written that
sort of awoken it.

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.080
50 years ago, we lived in a
racially segregated society

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:34.950
that had Jim Crow laws,
that separated

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:36.980
out blacks and whites--

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.870
apartheid was still rampant
in South Africa.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:47.730
75 years ago, the world
was organized

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.480
into colonial empires--

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.750
no longer.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:56.870
25 years ago, communism was
thought to be a vital, vibrant

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.110
alternative way to organize
society, just 25 years ago,

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.780
before the fall of
the Berlin Wall.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.790
And you'll like my last
favorite statistics--

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.500
15 years ago, Google
didn't exist.

00:08:12.368 --> 00:08:15.230
You won't like the next one
quite as much, there were also

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.900
no iPhones, no smartphones,
no--

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.520
Facebook didn't exist--

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.540
there were no iPods.

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:27.750
And if you go back 20
years ago, there was

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.240
no world wide web.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.530
The world is evolving.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.520
Our consciousness is evolving.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.080
Humanity is making
great progress.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.010
We can't always see it
because we see it--

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:42.250
if we don't study history, we
only see a snapshot and we're

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:45.710
just not aware of how much
progress the world has made.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.860
And I submit to you that
business and capitalism are

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.600
the major source of
that progress.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.730
And because, I mean, the
lifespan of human beings until

00:08:56.730 --> 00:09:00.890
capitalism was created was and
had been for over 40,000

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.070
years, was about 30 or less.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:07.280
Today, it's 68 across the world,
it's 78 in the United

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.040
States, it's 80 in Japan, which
is the longest lived

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.720
nation on the planet.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.420
So humanity's evolving, it's
making great progress.

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:16.890
Businesses is the
source of it.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:21.580
And business is fundamentally
good, and yet the narrative

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.870
about business is terrible.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:32.180
I mean, Gallup shows that the
reputation for business in

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:36.710
this society, for big business,
is 19% approval

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.530
rating for big business, which
is just slightly above

00:09:40.530 --> 00:09:41.910
Congress's rating--

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:44.360
it's at 16%.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.890
So business is, that means 81%
of the population doesn't like

00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:49.500
big businesses--

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:54.000
seen as fundamentally evil,
selfish, corrupt.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.246
And business is judged by its
worst practitioners, right?

00:09:58.246 --> 00:10:04.530
The Enrons, the Bernie Madoffs,
the WorldComs, the

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:09.940
AIG, the Wall Street banks,
and that's how business is

00:10:09.940 --> 00:10:12.780
portrayed, so it's judged by
its worst practitioners.

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.510
Something we don't do-- we don't
portray doctors by their

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.440
worst practitioners.

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.380
We don't portray policemen.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:24.460
We don't portray even
politicians, lawyers,

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:28.630
teachers, all the other
professions, we judge them

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:32.540
based on their intentions, we
don't judge them necessarily

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.510
on the very worst actors
that we see.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:36.890
And yet, that's what business is
compared against, the very

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:39.760
worst practitioners, and then
it's generalized through the

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.480
larger business culture.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.860
So basically I'm saying business
has a bad rap,

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.250
because business has been the
great value creator, not for a

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:50.910
few people, but for lifting
humanity up.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.390
That has been the legacy of
capitalism to the world.

00:10:55.390 --> 00:11:00.140
But the thesis of our book is
that while that's true,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.350
business could be
so much better.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:04.840
Business could be
so much better.

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.720
For many, many years, when we
were doing Whole Foods Market,

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.320
I thought Whole Foods
Market was alone.

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:14.180
I didn't know other businesses
were around like Whole Foods

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.400
that were as awake, as
conscious, as idealistic.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:24.690
But over the last decade or so,
I've met other companies

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.320
and other leaders of companies,
and I realized you

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.580
know, god, there are companies
out there like Google, and

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.050
Southwest Airlines, and
Patagonia, and The Container

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:40.180
Store, REI, Nordstrom's.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:44.930
There's a list of companies that
share a lot of the same

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:47.510
values that Whole Foods shares,
that has a higher

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:52.000
purpose to its existence, that
cares about the larger

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.940
society, that cares about the
environment, that has

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.520
stakeholder orientation.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.090
And as we did research,
we made an interesting

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.170
discovery--

00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:03.110
that these more conscious
businesses are not only

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.340
creating great value for the
larger society, they're also

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.910
far more successful
financially.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.420
This was the big discovery.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:12.220
I mean, not just a little bit.

00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:15.940
If you look in the book in
appendix A, as we do some

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.520
comparisons, we see that over
a 15 year period, the most

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.900
conscious public companies have
outperformed the S&amp;P 500

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.550
by a factor of 10
and 1/2 to one.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:28.040
That's not even close,
just blow it away.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:30.730
Companies like Google and Whole
Foods have just been

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.990
amazing financial performers
in the stock market.

00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:40.170
So I realized and my co-author
and I realized, we wanted to

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.230
start a movement.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:43.410
We have an organization, a
nonprofit organization called

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:46.600
Conscious Capitalism, Incs,
and our website's

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.610
consciouscapitalism.org.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.110
And we're actually having a big
conference here in the Bay

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.180
Area, in San Francisco
in April.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:56.130
So hopefully some of you will
come participate in that.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.460
So let me just get to the
heart and soul of what

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:03.900
conscious capitalism is,
what the philosophy is.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.790
The philosophy is that business
has the potential to

00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:11.320
have a higher purpose, besides
just making money.

00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.590
And because if you go to a
party, and you just ask

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:18.610
somebody routinely, what's the
purpose of business, I promise

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:20.520
you most the time, the answer's
going to be--

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.800
what do you mean, what's the
purpose of business?

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.330
Everybody knows the purpose
of business.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.276
Purpose of business
is to make money.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:27.720
Right?

00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:29.550
Isn't that what you'll
normally hear?

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:33.740
That is such an odd answer
because if you ask what the

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.810
purpose of a doctor is, doctors
are well-paid, the

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.220
purpose of a doctor's not to
make money, purpose of a

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:42.120
doctor is to heal people,
heal sick

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:44.190
people, or injured people.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.335
What's the purpose
of teachers?

00:13:46.335 --> 00:13:49.140
They educate.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.040
Architects design buildings.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.380
Engineers construct things.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:59.590
Journalists, theoretically,
reveal the truth.

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:05.400
So only business is defined
in this rather narrow,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.724
unflattering way that's
all about money.

00:14:09.724 --> 00:14:13.030
And yet, I've known
entrepreneurs all my life,

00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:15.240
I've known hundreds of
entrepreneurs, and with only

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.300
one or two exceptions did those
entrepreneurs start

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:22.230
their businesses primarily
to make money.

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.110
They wanted to make money, to
be sure, but that's not why

00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.920
they started it.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.120
It's not the purpose.

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.370
It's not why they exist.

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.180
My body cannot--

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.120
I can't live-- my body produces
red blood cells.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.190
If I stop producing red blood
cells, I'm going to die.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:44.520
But my purpose is not to produce
red blood cells.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.240
I have a more transcendent
purpose that gives purpose,

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.720
guidance, direction
for my life.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.270
And frankly, if you don't have a
purpose in your life, you're

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:55.550
going to suboptimize--

00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.540
you will not reach your full
potential as a human beings.

00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:01.900
We are purpose-driven animals
and we seek usually

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.110
transcendent purposes, some form
of the good, the true,

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:06.380
and the beautiful.

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.810
Or we identify also the heroic
as a fourth transcendent

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:14.330
purpose that animates humans'
ideals and also businesses

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:15.790
could follow.

00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:19.040
So the first principle of
conscious capitalism is find

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.600
your higher purpose.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:21.770
And it evolves over time.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.250
Whole Food's original higher
purpose was, when we started

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.900
it, was a very simple one--

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:29.650
we wanted to sell healthy
food to people, earn a

00:15:29.650 --> 00:15:33.250
living, have fun.

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:37.000
But as a business grows and
evolves, its purpose can grow

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.210
and evolve with it.

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.340
And now Whole Foods has much
more, as we've gotten larger

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.210
and our ability to do good in
the world has expanded, the

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.400
purpose has expanded with it.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.880
So now we want to help transform
the way people--

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.500
we know that 69% of Americans
are overweight, 36% are obese.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.310
We know that 80% of the money
we spend on health care in

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.390
America are for lifestyle
diseases such as heart

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.910
disease, stroke, type
2 diabetes,

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.400
cancer, autoimmune diseases.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:11.860
And these diseases are so
closely correlated with diet

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.100
and lifestyle.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.920
There's not going to be a
vaccination for cancer.

00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.360
There's not going to be a pill
you can take that's going to

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.660
reverse heart disease.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.310
These are things we're doing to
ourselves by the way we eat

00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.700
and the way we live.

00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.170
And so Whole Foods--

00:16:24.170 --> 00:16:28.840
one of our higher purposes now
is to educate our customers

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.720
and eventually the world on the

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.280
principles of healthy diet.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.980
And so people can reach their
highest and fullest

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:37.570
potential in life.

00:16:37.570 --> 00:16:38.820
We have a higher purpose
regarding the

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.290
agricultural system.

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:42.320
How do we create a more
sustainable agricultural

00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.850
system that is at the same
time highly productive?

00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:48.360
We've done this work in
sustainable seafood, we've

00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.830
done work in animal welfare
treatment, and now we're

00:16:50.830 --> 00:16:52.140
working on the big one--

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:58.240
because organic is great, but
it's kind of like it's stuck.

00:16:58.240 --> 00:16:59.440
It's either on or off.

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:04.060
It doesn't have a grading
for higher and higher

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.069
sustainability on the
agricultural, on the land.

00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:13.579
So we want to put things in like
ground water, nutrient

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:19.089
density of the soil,
environmental toxins.

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.839
There are different degrees of
toxicity and pesticides.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.910
You've got the dirty dozen,
which are highly toxic, and

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.770
you have others that
are less toxic.

00:17:26.770 --> 00:17:29.630
So all that needs to be measured
somehow or another.

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:34.050
And that information needs to
be fed back into the food

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:36.400
system so people can
be conscious of it.

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.633
So that's something Whole
Foods is going

00:17:37.633 --> 00:17:38.030
to be working on.

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:41.180
That's our next big project
in that regard.

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.600
We started a foundation called
the Whole Planet Foundation,

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.140
which does microcredit loans
in the developing world.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.100
And we've decided that
that's actually one

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:48.960
of our higher purposes--

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.780
to help end poverty.

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.570
We're now in 55 countries.

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:56.440
We've made loans that have
impacted over a million

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:57.970
people, improved their lives.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.830
These are working capital loans,
small loans to very

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:05.480
poor people, 93% women, has
a 98% repayment rate.

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.710
We have a volunteer program
where our team members can go

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:09.420
participate in it.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.120
And finally, the fourth higher
purpose is what I'm doing

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.040
right today with you, is that
to try to help businesses to

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.030
become more conscious,
to help the business

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.880
community to evolve.

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.660
Because unless business
community evolves, and

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.810
consciousness begins to shift
here, our country and this

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:31.090
world are going to move, and
are moving away, from the

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.570
principles that built
our prosperity.

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.350
For example, for most of our
history the United States

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:40.820
would have been ranked number
one in economic freedom.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:44.940
As recently as the year 2000,
we rank number three, only

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:47.580
behind Singapore
and Hong Kong.

00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:52.370
Today, we rank number 18, and
we're rapidly descending.

00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:55.540
We're losing our economic
freedom in America.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.910
And with it, our prosperity's
beginning to decline.

00:18:58.910 --> 00:19:03.850
They nation that was a light
onto the world for how to

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:05.480
create mass prosperity--

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:07.480
that light is beginning
to dim.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:10.710
So part of our purpose and my
purpose here today is to talk

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.920
about capitalism, and also to
talk about how businesses can

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:15.820
become more conscious.

00:19:15.820 --> 00:19:20.820
Because unless we can get that
approval rating up from 19%,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.430
the restrictions and controls
on business are going to

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.060
continue to multiply, and
we're going to move away

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:28.470
from-- we're killing the goose
that laid the golden eggs.

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:31.160
It's much harder if you're
young-- and everybody in this

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.410
room, just about as pretty
young-- it's very hard to

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:35.230
start a business today.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:37.980
Relatively speaking, compared to
when I started Whole Foods,

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.110
it was so much easier.

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:40.800
Now there's so many
restrictions, so many

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.960
barriers, so many bureaucratic
regulations you have to hop

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.420
over to practically
do anything.

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.280
So higher purpose,
first principal.

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:52.380
So Google has a higher
purpose, right?

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.440
Who wants to articulate what
that higher purpose might be?

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.500
You have a great slogan
that sums it up.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.390
Anybody want to take
a crack at it?

00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:00.840
Yes, sir.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.942
AUDIENCE: Organize the world's
information and make it

00:20:02.942 --> 00:20:04.260
universally accessible and--

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.320
JOHN MACKEY: There you go.

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.470
I think one of your co-founders,
I think, said how

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:13.380
can that not get you excited?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.420
That is very exciting.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:21.210
And Google is a transformative
organization that is improving

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.870
the world in countless ways.

00:20:22.870 --> 00:20:26.400
You are truly one of the
companies that is transforming

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.380
the world and rapidly.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:32.930
It's amazing how Google
has impacted our

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:36.010
world for the better.

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:40.350
And so every business has this
potential for higher purpose.

00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:43.690
Even widget makers have
potential for higher purpose.

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.770
It's simply understanding the
value that they're creating

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.220
and how they're improving
people's lives, and then

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:53.200
building their business model
around that higher purpose.

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.440
You put the purpose first.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:01.570
Secondly, we live in a much more
complex world and we have

00:21:01.570 --> 00:21:05.580
to come to understand that
there's a larger system,

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:08.420
almost a complex adaptive
system, that business exists

00:21:08.420 --> 00:21:11.020
in, which is summed up pretty
well with the stakeholder

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:12.380
model idea--

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:14.080
that there's various
stakeholders that are

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.520
voluntary exchanging with
the organization.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:20.000
So you have customers, you
have employees, you have

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.790
suppliers, you have investors,
you have the communities that

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:27.000
we live in, the larger
communities that the Earth's

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.190
part of, and we have
the environment.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:31.110
They're other secondary
stakeholders, such as the

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:36.900
government, the media, labor
unions, critics, activists, et

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:38.840
cetera, et cetera, that you also
have to take into account

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.820
and then our book talks
about that.

00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.180
But we identify those six major
stakeholders, the first

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.430
ones I named.

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.190
Business in the conscious
company does not merely create

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:52.030
value for its investors.

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:54.240
It creates value for all
of the stakeholder

00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.010
simultaneously.

00:21:56.010 --> 00:21:59.630
And I mean, Google is one of the
greatest examples of that

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:01.120
principle in action.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.350
Think about it.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:06.070
The value that you create for
customers is unbelievable.

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:10.290
I mean, I do this all the time
when I do a talk, I ask

00:22:10.290 --> 00:22:18.400
people, how many people here had
Googled at least one thing

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.050
in the last 24 hours?

00:22:20.050 --> 00:22:20.910
Virtually everybody--

00:22:20.910 --> 00:22:22.840
I know this group will all
raise their hands, but it

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.160
doesn't have to be--

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.500
wherever I go when I ask that
question, everybody raises

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:28.750
their hands.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:33.040
It's not just--

00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.465
of course you've got YouTube,
you've got all these different

00:22:35.465 --> 00:22:35.990
initiatives.

00:22:35.990 --> 00:22:39.480
I just heard about the car
initiative over lunch, and the

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:43.180
vision that we may end up--

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:46.095
In an urban environment, we now
might not have to even own

00:22:46.095 --> 00:22:48.400
cars-- that you'd have these
self-driving cars like your

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.680
bicycles and they'd just
be everywhere.

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:52.770
And you'd have a different
transportation system that

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:58.610
would be more environmentally
sustainable, would provide a

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.510
great deal of equity, and would
be very convenient.

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:04.760
That is a transformative
ideal.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.960
Those are the kind of ideas that
come out of the Google

00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:10.910
organization all the time.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.980
So we're creating value
for your employees.

00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.830
I mean, your food
is tremendous.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:16.790
They were showing me
your massage rooms.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:20.200
It's no accident Google's been
named, not only one of the 100

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.910
best companies to work for, but
the number one company to

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:28.300
work for, for four years, which
is no company has that

00:23:28.300 --> 00:23:30.870
distinction.

00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:32.580
Google's been an incredible
investment.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:36.050
Look at the value it's created
for its investors, and how

00:23:36.050 --> 00:23:39.160
much that stock has increased
since it went public is

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:40.410
phenomenal.

00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.320
If you think about your
suppliers that trade with you,

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.690
they're all benefiting
from their

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:47.110
relationship with the Google.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:49.400
So you're creating
these win-win-win

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.280
strategies as a business.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.020
That's what conscious
businesses do.

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.720
They do it in a conscious way.

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.820
Everybody wins.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:58.510
We kind of have this mental
block because of sports, that

00:23:58.510 --> 00:24:02.080
if somebody wins, somebody
else loses.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.020
But the great thing about
business, particularly

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:07.150
conscious business, is
no one has to lose.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:10.880
Everybody can win because
everybody that's voluntary

00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:12.180
exchanging is benefiting.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:15.010
Even competitors can win.

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:19.680
If you view your competitors as
engaged with you in a quest

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.790
for mutual excellence,
competitors help you push you

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:24.225
out of your complacency.

00:24:24.225 --> 00:24:27.730
They help stimulate
you to strive

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:31.080
harder, to become better.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.780
And so, at least in our
business, we love it when our

00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.800
competitors come up
with a good idea.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:40.700
Because we feel like we can
take their own ideas and

00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.850
improve on them faster than
they can improve on it

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:44.560
themselves, and spread it
through our organization

00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.950
quicker than they can spread
it through their own

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:47.450
organizations.

00:24:47.450 --> 00:24:50.820
So we love it when innovations
occur anywhere, in the food

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.790
business because it's like,
oh my god, that's so cool.

00:24:53.790 --> 00:24:56.670
Let's copy that and
make it better.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:58.130
So stakeholder philosophy.

00:24:58.130 --> 00:24:59.500
The conscious business
has a theory of

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.740
leadership that's different.

00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:06.390
It's not leaders who are in it
necessarily just to line their

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:07.960
own pockets.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:11.260
The history of leadership
has mostly been about--

00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.660
people are attracted to
it because they're

00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:14.315
attracted to power.

00:25:14.315 --> 00:25:16.320
There's some people that just
really want to be, lord it

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.050
over others-- there's power.

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.510
Or money.

00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.700
And they just want to
make a lot of money.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.310
And while those motives still
exist, in the conscious

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:27.560
business, they're more--

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.490
you could say you have a
militaristic drive or a

00:25:29.490 --> 00:25:30.810
mercenary drive--

00:25:30.810 --> 00:25:32.560
and now we have a
mission drive.

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:35.200
That people, that the best
leaders that we need for these

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.790
conscious businesses have a
sense of purpose, a sense of

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:40.860
missionary, activity, to make
the world a better place.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.960
And they serve the overall
organization, right?

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.770
They serve the company.

00:25:45.770 --> 00:25:47.020
They're become servant
leaders.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:52.270
And then the fourth part, you
have to create a great culture

00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:54.870
because human beings are
moving up Maslow's

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.310
Hierarchy of Needs.

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.790
The kind of things that used
to satisfy people 50 years

00:25:58.790 --> 00:26:00.720
ago, no longer cut it.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.890
We've got to create
organizations where human

00:26:02.890 --> 00:26:04.790
beings can flourish.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:07.180
They can self-actualize
themselves, they're fully

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.080
empowered, so they can
reach their full

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.250
potential as human beings.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:15.040
So those are the four principles
of conscious

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.470
capitalistic business--

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:20.350
higher purpose, stakeholder
integration, servant

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:23.000
leadership, empowered culture.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.440
You put all four of those
elements together, and you

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.670
have a different kind of
company, a company that is

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.070
making the world
a better place.

00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:36.810
So capitalism, I like to say,
has been good, but we can make

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:37.840
it so much better.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.980
If we become conscious of
purpose, creating value for

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.290
stakeholders, a different kind
of leadership philosophy and a

00:26:43.290 --> 00:26:45.980
different kind of culture.

00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:47.820
We will change that reputation
of business.

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:51.890
We will shift it from an 19%
approval rate to a 90%

00:26:51.890 --> 00:26:52.950
approval rate.

00:26:52.950 --> 00:26:57.140
We'll begin to get back the
freedoms that we're losing,

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:00.730
economic freedoms, and the world
will progressive at a

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.920
far more rapid rate.

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:06.460
So that's the vision that
we outlined in the book.

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.810
Google, again, as mentioned
numerous times, of course,

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:13.350
Whole Foods is mentioned the
most because I know the most

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:14.140
about that.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.920
So it's natural that I would
write about Whole Foods.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.660
So our story, my own awakenings,
my own growth as a

00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:23.000
human being is discussed
in the book in

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.070
some depth as well.

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.110
I think that kind of
sums up the book.

00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:29.810
At least can fuel
a few questions.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.880
So why don't we jump into that,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.761
let's get into questions.

00:27:34.761 --> 00:27:37.210
Yeah, why don't you help
me out here, Meng?

00:27:39.910 --> 00:27:41.040
AUDIENCE: John, first of
all, thank you for a

00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.920
great set of stores.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:42.990
I shop there all the time.

00:27:42.990 --> 00:27:43.620
JOHN MACKEY: Thank you.

00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.130
AUDIENCE: And happy to pay
the higher prices too.

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:46.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.830
JOHN MACKEY: You
can afford to.

00:27:49.830 --> 00:27:52.830
AUDIENCE: So whatever you said
makes eminent sense, it's a

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:53.410
no-brainer.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:55.350
Every company should
adopt it, right?

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.420
Nothing should hold us back.

00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:59.560
And yet, very few companies
have adopted this model.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.980
So what stops from the other 495
companies in the Fortune

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.080
500 from doing this?

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.310
JOHN MACKEY: They don't know.

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.930
Well, I think there's
certain--

00:28:08.930 --> 00:28:12.140
First of all, there's legacy
companies that are trapped in

00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:12.860
their own history.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.870
It's very difficult.

00:28:13.870 --> 00:28:16.150
Think of them as great
big cruise ships.

00:28:16.150 --> 00:28:19.980
You know how long it takes to
like turn a cruise ship?

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.950
Takes like 30 minutes.

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.800
They got so much momentum, to
be able to turn that cruise

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:26.350
ship around takes a long time.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:30.310
Well, these big legacy
corporations that have

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:33.580
operated under a different
philosophy and they have their

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:35.500
sort of entrenched culture,
it's very

00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:37.500
difficult for them to shift.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:40.560
That's why I really believe most
of them will not shift,

00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:44.200
but what will happen, is we'll
create a whole new conscious

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.640
business world around them,
and they'll eventually be

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.340
dinosaurs and will disappear.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:50.660
It's entrepreneurs.

00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:52.760
It's particularly the young,
millennial generation.

00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.330
I really wrote this book for
the young people because

00:28:55.330 --> 00:28:56.960
they're going to embrace these
ideas and they're going to

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.110
build the new companies.

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:02.360
Google is one of the great
examples, but there will be

00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.520
lots of other ones that are
going to be created, that are

00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.310
inspired by companies
like Google,

00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.260
inspired by Whole Foods.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:12.320
And so I don't worry.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.780
We have a chapter about how
companies can transform

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:17.390
themselves to become more
conscious, but I actually

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:19.470
think it's a lot easier to
start a new company.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.280
And then you can just do it
right from the very beginning.

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.910
You don't have a legacy
to overcome.

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:27.290
But this will triumph,
and it'll triumph

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:28.660
because it works better.

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:32.220
And in capitalism, whatever
works better, spreads.

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.260
If this didn't produce better
economic results, if it was

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:38.910
just idealism, it wouldn't
ultimately succeed.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.530
But the fact that it performs
so much better economically

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:45.500
too is what makes me assured
that it's going to be spread.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:46.460
It's going to spread--

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.950
and we wrote the book
to spread it.

00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:51.260
Surely, just idealistic
reason.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.880
All my roles are being donated
to the foundations, so I'm not

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:57.950
making a penny out of it But I
hope the ideas will spread--

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:02.114
that more businesses will
try to become conscious.

00:30:02.114 --> 00:30:04.150
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you kind of
touched on this earlier.

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.590
You mentioned Google, Whole
Foods founders, CEOs, and how

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:08.770
they have that ability
to kind of

00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:10.180
structure from the beginning.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:13.680
What advice would you give to
a new CEO who's at a legacy

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.930
company, who still has
responsibilities to the

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:18.660
street, quarterly earnings
calls, how would you advise

00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:21.240
them and their investors, say,
we may take short-term

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:25.140
increases or losses, increased
expenditures, to really change

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:25.660
our culture.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:28.750
How would you advise a new
CEO in that situation?

00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:31.780
JOHN MACKEY: Well, I can tell.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:33.900
You what we do is talk
about in the book.

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.070
I'll deal with the quarterly
thing in a second.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.210
First thing they have to
do is they have to go

00:30:39.210 --> 00:30:40.770
discover their purpose.

00:30:40.770 --> 00:30:43.100
And so we call a
purpose search.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.690
You bring your key stakeholders
together, you go

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:50.350
off site, you do a retreat,
and together it's like

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.090
archaeologists, you're
digging through--

00:30:52.090 --> 00:30:54.830
If it's a legacy company, they
had a higher purpose when the

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:56.510
entrepreneurs started it.

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:58.670
They may have forgotten it, the
bean counters might have

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:02.210
taken over, and it might be
financial goals only now, but

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.510
once upon a time they were
led by a higher purpose.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.710
So you can rediscover that.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:08.600
Or you can co-create it.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:11.280
You can say, let's have
a fresh start.

00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:13.150
What do we want to
do in the world?

00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:15.220
How can we make a difference?

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.840
So until they discovered that
higher purpose, the rest of it

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:20.240
doesn't make much difference.

00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:25.326
Regarding dealing with Wall
Street, you know, I'll have to

00:31:25.326 --> 00:31:26.576
tell you that--

00:31:30.448 --> 00:31:33.420
all of the stakeholders that
a company has, customers,

00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:37.480
employees, suppliers, investors,
communities--

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.420
the easiest one to
deal with, in my

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:41.350
experience, is the investors.

00:31:41.350 --> 00:31:43.790
The customers are far more
difficult, at least in the

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:45.280
food retailing business,
I can tell you.

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:47.900
Because no matter how well you
do, they still want your

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.940
prices to be lower.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:51.190
You get cracks at your place
being expensive all the time.

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:53.520
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.340
JOHN MACKEY: And they want
higher quality, they want

00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:56.960
better services.

00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:01.100
So however well you satisfy
them, the ante keeps going up.

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.810
Same thing with the people
that work for you--

00:32:02.810 --> 00:32:06.930
OK, so I get free food, free
massages, and all these other

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:11.370
benefits at Google, but what are
you getting for me lately?

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.980
People get easily adapted to
whatever benefits they receive

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.610
and they begin to take
it for granted.

00:32:17.610 --> 00:32:19.230
And they want more.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.190
The investors want more too.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:22.370
They want a higher
stock price, they

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:23.870
want greater dividends.

00:32:23.870 --> 00:32:26.320
But they're the least complex.

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.260
They just want you to
make more money.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:31.170
And in a lot of ways, that's
the easiest thing to do.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.060
So long as you do that, they
don't care about your

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:34.050
philosophy.

00:32:34.050 --> 00:32:37.200
And the rest of it, they pretty
much leave you alone.

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.220
But when you have customers,
if you accidentally say the

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:46.010
wrong thing when you're on APR
and use the wrong words, you

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.305
get a lot of hate mail, people
boycott you, they say they're

00:32:48.305 --> 00:32:49.890
never going to talk
to you again.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:55.470
So customers are a lot harder
to keep happy, in my

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.110
experience, than investors.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.920
But you still have the pressure
of the quarterly

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.090
earnings thing.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:04.000
And I think what I would do if
I was that CEO, I would begin

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.750
to explain the larger process.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.880
I would frame it up.

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.590
I would say OK, we've created
a three year plan

00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.460
or five year plan.

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:13.510
We're going to start at X and
here's what's going to happen.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.220
And then you're fully

00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.920
transparent with the investors.

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.470
You're telling them what's
going to happen.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:19.970
And then they can make
a decision--

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.350
OK, I'm selling the stock.

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:24.240
This guy's basically telling
he's going to--

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.880
they're not going to make as
much money for a while.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:29.090
And other people buy into the
vision and they become--

00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:32.750
you've got to attract the kind
of investors that you want,

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.380
that align with your values.

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:40.690
Whole Foods, for example, we
really cultivate our, we

00:33:40.690 --> 00:33:42.380
cultivate long-term holders.

00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:44.640
We are very transparent with
the investment community.

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.200
We tell them who we are,
what we're doing,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.840
what our values are.

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:52.950
We don't really want these day
traders or these speculators

00:33:52.950 --> 00:33:54.150
who are in and out
of the stock.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:33:55.250
We don't want them
to own our stock.

00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:58.100
We can't stop them from buying
our stock, but they're not the

00:33:58.100 --> 00:33:59.090
ones we're talking to.

00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.880
We're always talking to
the long-term holders.

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:06.220
And we keep them fully informed
and we do we say.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.560
So if know you're going to
have to cut earnings for

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.650
awhile while you make this
transition, then be

00:34:11.650 --> 00:34:15.469
transparent about it,
be honest about it.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:18.500
You get the investors that you
deserve, so make sure you

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.835
deserve good investors.

00:34:20.835 --> 00:34:21.989
AUDIENCE: Hi, I have a question

00:34:21.989 --> 00:34:24.090
about your hiring process.

00:34:24.090 --> 00:34:27.010
When it comes to culture, I
think at Google we know it's

00:34:27.010 --> 00:34:29.850
really important to make sure
that your new employees kind

00:34:29.850 --> 00:34:32.429
of fit that culture, so I'm
curious how you, both at the

00:34:32.429 --> 00:34:34.780
corporate level and the store
level look for that in

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.639
potential employees.

00:34:36.639 --> 00:34:39.260
JOHN MACKEY: Whole Foods does
a couple of unique things at

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:40.850
the store levels, in particular
where most of our

00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:45.460
people are, right, 95% of the
people are in the stores.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.429
First thing we do is
we hire people on a

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:49.090
probationary basis.

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.080
Well, the first thing we do is
you do group interviews.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.790
So we let the team interview
people, so it's not just one

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:57.600
person doing the interviewing.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.600
It's not a HR person doing
the interviewing.

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:04.230
It's the team leader, and their
top people on the team,

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:06.100
and they're doing the
interviewing.

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.850
And then when a person gets
hired, they get hired on a

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:12.400
probationary basis, from
30 to 90 days.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.870
And then they have to be voted
on by the whole team, and it

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:17.100
requires a 2/3 positive vote.

00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:20.580
So if the team doesn't approve
this person, they don't stay

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.000
on the team.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.820
That doesn't mean they're fired
from the company, they

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.285
could still find another
team to hook up on.

00:35:25.285 --> 00:35:27.460
But if that team may have
rejected them because--

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.540
I always say you can fool the
team leader, but you can't

00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:31.720
fool the whole team.

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.240
They see through you
collectively.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.260
So those are a couple of
things that we do.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.630
And practically at the corporate
level, we do

00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:44.930
multiple interviews and
they're always group

00:35:44.930 --> 00:35:45.950
interviews.

00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:49.480
Generally, we mostly
hire from--

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:51.560
promotions occur from
within the company,

00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:53.000
I mean 98% of them.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.030
We post all the positions.

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:55.930
People apply for it.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.895
I really think if you bring in
too many outsiders and then

00:35:58.895 --> 00:36:02.205
you elevate them above people,
you really demotivate people.

00:36:02.205 --> 00:36:04.290
It's like, I've been busting my
butt for this company and I

00:36:04.290 --> 00:36:07.430
didn't even get a shot
at this, that sucks.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:10.460
So that's what we do
at Whole Foods.

00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.560
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
your talk today.

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.980
I just wanted to kind of focus
on spreading this great idea

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.660
into different parts
of the world.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:22.410
It was really great seeing that
this idea of conscious

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.870
consumerism and capitalism kind
of spreading out in the

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:30.040
developed world like
Europe and the US.

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.140
I can see it could be a little
bit more challenging to spread

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:35.840
this idea, both for consumers
and companies

00:36:35.840 --> 00:36:37.680
in developing markets.

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:43.250
So my question is, how we'll
be able to help spread this

00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:45.810
idea to those in the developing
countries.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.560
JOHN MACKEY: That's a
very good question.

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.580
Because I do think consciousness
tends to--

00:36:53.580 --> 00:36:55.890
we talk a little bit about in
the book, but probably didn't

00:36:55.890 --> 00:36:57.710
explore it as much
as I'd like to--

00:36:57.710 --> 00:37:00.330
but I think consciousness moves
in rather predictable

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:04.310
stages, both for individuals,
for companies,

00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:06.430
and even for countries.

00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:10.810
So I always say it's bad to
try to enforce your values

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.930
that you might have and your
consciousness on some other

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:15.570
individual, or some
other company,

00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:17.100
or some other country.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:18.710
I think people have to
go through their own

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:20.420
evolutionary process.

00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:23.010
For example, I think it's
fundamentally wrong to try to

00:37:23.010 --> 00:37:29.320
enforce child labor laws,
environmental regulations, et

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:32.260
cetera, et cetera, on
other countries.

00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:36.110
Those countries have got
to reach their own

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:36.970
evolutionary journey.

00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.170
The United States has a bad
track record over our

00:37:39.170 --> 00:37:44.000
historic, as we know from
slavery, racism, child labor

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.080
abuses, environmental
degradation.

00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:50.620
The United States has evolved,
but we had to go through a

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:51.680
long hard period.

00:37:51.680 --> 00:37:53.360
We didn't just wake
up with it.

00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.680
So I think other countries
have to go

00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:57.110
through similar stages.

00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.500
Hopefully, they can go through
it faster because they have

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:04.230
the benefit of learning
from our experiences.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:07.840
But I just think there's a
natural upward flow in

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:08.860
consciousness.

00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.420
That's just the way I've
experienced my own life and

00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:13.470
that's why I experience
other people.

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:15.990
So I say you get the
ideas out there.

00:38:15.990 --> 00:38:18.970
Remember, we live in this
interconnected world today.

00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:22.360
It's so fascinating to me that
if we have an innovation,

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.610
like, let me tell you a story.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:29.340
About three years ago, one of
our stores in the Bay Area,

00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:30.590
actually in Santa Rosa.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:33.080
We opened a new store
in Santa Rosa.

00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.620
And they--

00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:36.520
without permission from Austin
or anything else, because

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.450
we're very decentralized and
empowered, in the beer and

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:43.130
wine department, they created
what they called a tap room.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:48.765
They had these 16 artisan craft
microbrews, and they set

00:38:48.765 --> 00:38:53.520
it up as a bar with the big
screen television, and they

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.000
created a special
ambiance for it.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.310
And now, if they'd asked
permission from Austin for

00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:03.390
that idea, probably just oh,
that's a stupid idea.

00:39:03.390 --> 00:39:05.120
You're really talking about
putting a bar in a

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:06.290
supermarket.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:07.940
Who the heck's going to want
to go to a bar in a

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.240
supermarket, it's not
going to work.

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.890
But of course, they didn't
have to ask permission.

00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:13.140
They could just do
the experiment

00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.180
and see what happens.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:17.820
So they open it up and within a
week, it's sales are higher

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:20.540
than the entire seafood
department at that store, in

00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.490
just this little tiny
little bar room.

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.770
And then other stores, because
the internet, the schematics

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:30.710
could be instantly sent around
the company, the sales, the

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.850
gross margins, the complete
financial results of it.

00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:37.285
And then other stores start
to do it, except

00:39:37.285 --> 00:39:38.300
they improve on it.

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.880
It's like, ha, we can
do better than that.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:45.440
And so you have this continued
upward flow of progress

00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:49.020
because it's they do this, and
then the new innovation occurs

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:51.260
there, everybody sees
that, and it's like

00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:52.050
that's a great idea.

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:54.030
We're going to do that, we
can make it even better.

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:56.730
So you have this continuous
improvement.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:00.270
And so because the internet
connects us together, and you

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.970
can easily send all this
information around, it's easy

00:40:03.970 --> 00:40:06.410
for ideas to spread.

00:40:06.410 --> 00:40:10.590
It used to be cultural
transmission took decades,

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:13.060
centuries, because
the information

00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.340
just couldn't flow.

00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.400
But today the information
flows instantaneously.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:21.570
So I think other countries are
going to advance at a very

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:26.910
rapid rate because they can
piggyback on the information

00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:28.690
that other countries are--

00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:31.490
I mean, look how so many
developing countries, they

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.370
don't even have to put in the
whole landline technology for

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:36.201
phones, they just piggy--

00:40:36.201 --> 00:40:37.520
They just, what's that word?

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.210
They leapfrogged over it.

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.600
They can just do cell.

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.470
You don't need to do that exact
same development thing,

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.020
so their evolution can
be accelerated.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:49.460
I do think that's what's
going to happen.

00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:50.990
People get impatient.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.580
It's a little bit like if you
have a child and you're

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.575
watching that child grow, you
won't see the child growing.

00:40:57.575 --> 00:41:00.480
But if you don't see it for a
year and you come back, it's

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.130
changed tremendously.

00:41:02.130 --> 00:41:05.640
For example, I've been to
Thailand twice my life.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:07.620
I went in 1990.

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:10.150
I couldn't believe how
inexpensive it was, and how

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:12.540
poor, and in a lot of ways,
backwards it was.

00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:16.620
I came back in 2007.

00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.090
I didn't recognize the place.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:20.170
It was unbelievable.

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:24.660
Where I could stay in Phuket
for $12 a night and get a

00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:28.790
pretty decent room, that same
room now $300 a night.

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.170
The whole country had become
immensely, much more

00:41:31.170 --> 00:41:32.420
prosperous.

00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:37.650
You couldn't even get around
Bangkok in 1990.

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:40.960
It was just one giant
scooter traffic jam.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.060
Now they have this monorail
system that goes all around

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.610
the city, you can
get everywhere.

00:41:44.610 --> 00:41:46.500
I mean, it's amazing how--

00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.390
But if I'd been living there,
I wouldn't have seen the

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:49.320
transformation.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.220
But not having seen it, I was
like blown away by it.

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:56.940
So I do think this evolution
is accelerating because in

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.850
fact, kind of my vision, I
always like to say that human

00:41:59.850 --> 00:42:02.410
resources are limited
on this planet.

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:04.540
We have ecological
constraints.

00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:06.940
But our creativity
is not limited.

00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:11.130
Human beings have infinite
limitless creativity and we

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:12.510
are rapidly accelerating it.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:16.780
So the degree that we can
empower every individual to

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:20.210
contribute their own
entrepreneurial creativity to

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:24.090
the larger world pool, at that
rate we will be able to

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.500
accelerate our evolution and
our advance and we'll solve

00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.610
new problems.

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:29.600
It's actually the young
generation who doesn't yet

00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.350
know what it can't do, that
creates most of the solutions

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.760
to the problems that their
parents' generation left to

00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:38.580
them because their parents
couldn't figure it out.

00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:41.395
So there's lots of problems for
young people in this room,

00:42:41.395 --> 00:42:42.790
and that's your job.

00:42:42.790 --> 00:42:44.190
You're supposed to
go solve them.

00:42:44.190 --> 00:42:47.290
And you're doing a lot of good
stuff here at Google, so

00:42:47.290 --> 00:42:48.540
that's really cool.

00:42:50.230 --> 00:42:52.760
AUDIENCE: Well, first of all,
thank you very much for having

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:55.220
a store about two miles
from my house.

00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:58.130
It makes me very happy
to shop there.

00:42:58.130 --> 00:43:02.340
And the question that I have,
it's actually probably a good

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.100
bridge off of what
you just said.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:07.540
Well, we're very young, most
of the people in this room,

00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:10.510
and we're very impatient.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.460
And it's actually really hard
sometimes to wait and to see

00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:19.330
results play out, or to even
kind of have that aha moment,

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:22.310
like yes, things are working,
because it takes some time.

00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:26.050
So my question to you is at
what point did you really

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.320
reach your aha moment, like yes,
this business model is

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.310
working, and yes, there's people
that are behind me that

00:43:32.310 --> 00:43:36.508
are supporting this, and I
should continue doing this.

00:43:36.508 --> 00:43:37.940
JOHN MACKEY: Well, I
think I've had a

00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.740
series of aha moments.

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:41.230
I mean, I continue
to have them.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.160
So I'm not sure exactly when--

00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.240
I do know when I got the
stakeholder theory, I write

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:52.020
about in the book.

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:56.310
I got it really a long time ago,
our very first store at

00:43:56.310 --> 00:43:57.560
Whole Foods Market.

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.010
In 1981, Austin had the worst
flood it had in 100 years.

00:44:04.010 --> 00:44:07.030
We had a 100 year flood and
we had eight feet of

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:08.590
water in the store.

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.520
And we were broke, we were
bankrupt, we were

00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.400
washed down the river.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.990
No flood insurance, we were a
young, fledgling business, and

00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:20.950
we came in the next day to start
cleaning up the mess,

00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:22.900
and what happened then
changed my life and

00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.320
I had an aha moment.

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.530
Because dozens of customers
showed up and helped us clean

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:28.820
up the store.

00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:31.750
And then people we didn't know,
just neighbors, came in

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.010
and pitched in.

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:34.270
And our team members came in.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.620
And we couldn't pay
their salaries,

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.590
they worked for free.

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.470
The suppliers gave us new
inventory on credit.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:45.260
The bank loaned us new money on
my signature loan, which I

00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.080
was thinking about changing my
name, that's how good my

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:50.200
signature was on that day.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.170
And the investors kicked
in more capital.

00:44:52.170 --> 00:44:55.410
So all the stakeholders
came together to

00:44:55.410 --> 00:44:57.160
save Whole Foods Market.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:59.670
And that was an aha moment for
me because I realized, oh my

00:44:59.670 --> 00:45:02.790
god, all of these
people matter.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:05.720
They all are creating the Whole
Foods Market experience.

00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.850
It's not just a few people.

00:45:06.850 --> 00:45:09.390
It's not just an egotistical
entrepreneur.

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:11.520
It's all of the stakeholders
are creating it.

00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:12.910
So that was a huge
transformative

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.270
experience for me.

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:19.800
It's good to be impatient
because that's what goads you

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.260
to make a change, to be
dissatisfied with the world

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.690
that you find yourself in.

00:45:24.690 --> 00:45:28.110
One of things I like to tell
young people, when I was

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.320
young, this world was really
screwed up, it really was.

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.830
I think it's a lot worse back
then, that it is today.

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:39.770
And I just always blame my
parents for it, like couldn't

00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:41.270
you guys have done
a better job?

00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:43.870
This world's got so many
problems with it.

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.020
And it was only when I got
older, I realized, god it was

00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.540
screwed up when my
parents got here.

00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:54.260
Someday you'll be older and
you'll see when your children

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:57.260
and young people come up and
say, I can't believe the

00:45:57.260 --> 00:45:58.130
world's messed up.

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.650
And you will see how much better
the world is than when

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:02.540
you were young.

00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.950
It's just that people don't
have a sense of history.

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:08.670
That's why I started up by
talking about how far the

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:10.950
world has come in 200 years.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:13.460
And it's come so far
in my lifetime.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:14.800
It's amazing.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:20.780
And you'll see in 30 years, that
humanity has collectively

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.050
advanced remarkably.

00:46:22.050 --> 00:46:24.180
But the young people there
will just still see new

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.590
problems because there'll
still be problems.

00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:32.130
The reality is that human
beings are not perfect.

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:34.530
We have lots of flaws,
we've got egos, and

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:35.970
we do stupid things.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:40.400
And we still have things like
war, and there's environmental

00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.650
challenges, and that's
what makes it

00:46:42.650 --> 00:46:44.500
interesting to be alive.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.390
So what I do know is that we
need your creativity and your

00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:53.030
dissatisfaction to help
contribute to making the world

00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:54.110
a better place.

00:46:54.110 --> 00:46:57.650
And I really think that the
idealism of the young people

00:46:57.650 --> 00:47:00.980
is why we are able to evolve.

00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.180
I know at Whole Foods Market,
our average age at Whole Foods

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:04.970
is similar to Google.

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:08.330
Our average age is about 30
or 31 at Whole Foods.

00:47:08.330 --> 00:47:12.950
And the young people are so
environmentally conscious.

00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:14.740
I always thought I was pretty
environmentally conscious, but

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.700
they really are.

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.240
And they push us in
this direction.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:21.270
The green mission teams that
we've created that are moving

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.880
Whole Foods towards zero
waste, all types of

00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:29.170
measurements, so we can do
better, are inspiring to me.

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:33.040
So get with it.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.890
AUDIENCE: So I have
a question.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:36.980
I feel like nutrition science
is a bit of a young science,

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:39.240
and so I was curious if you
could share your experience,

00:47:39.240 --> 00:47:42.320
how you kind of weed through and
find those trusted sources

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:45.120
of information.

00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.280
JOHN MACKEY: Well, in my own
case, part of it's what I've

00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:49.800
learned about my own body.

00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:52.350
I think ultimately, you got
to do a lot of dietary

00:47:52.350 --> 00:47:54.650
experiments and you got to find
out what works for you

00:47:54.650 --> 00:47:55.970
and what doesn't work.

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.290
The good thing is there's ways
to check now, you can check

00:47:58.290 --> 00:48:00.200
your cholesterol, you can check
your blood pressure.

00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:07.580
In fact, I got a app downloaded
today that, forget

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.350
the name of it, but it was an
app that would measure my

00:48:09.350 --> 00:48:10.700
stress level.

00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.955
And since I'm on this tour, I
figured my stress levels are

00:48:12.955 --> 00:48:13.520
going to be really high.

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.130
I tested at like the 1% level.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:17.600
I was like, this is a cool app
because I felt really good

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.620
about myself.

00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:24.040
So we've got much more
technology that helps us to

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:24.870
check the stuff out.

00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:27.450
But you've got to do your own
research, got to do your own

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:28.810
experiments.

00:48:28.810 --> 00:48:32.240
I have a definite philosophy
about healthy eating that is

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:35.010
that we should eat
whole foods.

00:48:35.010 --> 00:48:36.433
We shouldn't eat processed
foods, we

00:48:36.433 --> 00:48:37.620
should eat whole foods.

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.020
It should mostly be plants.

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.010
I've been a vegan
for 10 years.

00:48:40.010 --> 00:48:41.870
I don't think you have to be
a vegan, but probably--

00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:44.570
I'm an ethical vegan and I think
you probably just need

00:48:44.570 --> 00:48:47.100
to make sure you get your animal
foods down to maybe

00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.030
less than 10% of
your calories.

00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:52.180
And you eat nutrient-dense
foods, lots of fruits and

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:53.190
vegetables, in particular.

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:56.300
I really do believe that's the
healthiest diet and I've never

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:58.960
seen anybody eat that diet
and not flourish on it.

00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:01.636
But still, probably there are
some people that diet

00:49:01.636 --> 00:49:02.720
wouldn't work for.

00:49:02.720 --> 00:49:06.280
So I've read hundreds of books
on diet and nutrition, so I've

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.510
done my own research, my
own thinking about it.

00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:12.050
But if you're looking for the
definitive, it's not really a

00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.750
young science, it's just hard
to track this stuff.

00:49:14.750 --> 00:49:18.720
Because people lie about
what they eat.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:20.240
There's no good way
to know exactly

00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.380
what people are eating.

00:49:21.380 --> 00:49:24.060
There's no good controlled
experiments you can do that

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:25.440
really make any difference.

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:29.340
So Whole Foods has funded
some research.

00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.960
We have a program for our most
at-risk team members, those

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.710
who are obese, those who have
heart disease, those who have

00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:37.690
diabetes, it's what we call
a total health immersion.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:41.140
We take them off-site for a week
at the company's expense,

00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.750
this is strictly voluntary,
and we do intensive

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.050
nutritional healthy
eating education.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:47.590
We feed them a healthy diet.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:51.320
We take their biometrics stuff
the first day they arrive and

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.040
the day before they leave.

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.650
And I'll tell you a story
that kind of sums it up.

00:49:55.650 --> 00:49:58.950
We got this president of our
Southwest region, a guy named

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:01.930
Mark, his nickname's Flash.

00:50:01.930 --> 00:50:03.440
And he was obese.

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:06.830
And he was really, he was a
great leader in the company,

00:50:06.830 --> 00:50:09.800
but he wasn't really looking
like he's a Whole Fooder,

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.440
right, because he's not
healthy, he's obese.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.780
And I've nagged him, and I got
to him to go to the immersion.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.130
So I showed up at that immersion
on the last day, and

00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:21.390
I say hey, Mark, how's it going,
Flash, how's it going.

00:50:21.390 --> 00:50:23.530
This program is amazing.

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:25.170
So I've been here one week.

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:26.860
I've lost 10 pounds.

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.090
My cholesterol has dropped
40 points.

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:31.140
My blood pressure dropped
30 points.

00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:33.810
And I have pigged out
at every meal.

00:50:33.810 --> 00:50:37.050
I will eat this way the
rest of my life.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:38.410
Flash-forward one year.

00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:40.500
He's lost 95 pounds.

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:46.090
He's bicycling 180 miles every
week, and plus doing a century

00:50:46.090 --> 00:50:48.950
entry on the weekends.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:51.480
And his vitality is amazing.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:56.180
And of course, he's become a
missionary for healthy eating.

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:00.940
I mean, there are lots of
good books to read.

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:02.140
I can recommend them.

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:05.850
The science itself is still,
you say early stage.

00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:09.980
It's not that early, it's just
difficult for it to get to

00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.710
authoritative due to the
restrictions of the fact that

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:12.970
you can't--

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:15.910
You can do experiments on
rats, it's harder to do

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:20.668
experiments on human beings that
are really controlled.

00:51:20.668 --> 00:51:23.010
AUDIENCE: Kind of to piggyback
off of that question, I just

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:25.300
wanted to get your thoughts
about obesity, and

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.330
specifically, food deserts
in the US.

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:30.570
So it sounds like you're doing a
lot to help the employees at

00:51:30.570 --> 00:51:34.685
Whole Foods, but Whole Foods are
typically in large, urban,

00:51:34.685 --> 00:51:37.890
socioeconomically well-off
areas, and so I'm kind of

00:51:37.890 --> 00:51:42.140
wondering how you think we can
solve the food desert problem

00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:43.850
across the US.

00:51:43.850 --> 00:51:46.360
Because I think a lot of people
in areas would like to

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.790
eat healthy, but they
simply don't have

00:51:47.790 --> 00:51:48.670
the means to do that.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:50.340
They might be hundreds
of miles from the

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:52.800
nearest Whole Foods.

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.370
JOHN MACKEY: Well, I
think two things.

00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:59.230
One that's an entrepreneurial
opportunity for someone,

00:51:59.230 --> 00:52:01.615
someone young, someone
idealistic.

00:52:04.990 --> 00:52:09.160
So that is a problem in our
society, and when you have

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:11.110
problems, you have
opportunities for

00:52:11.110 --> 00:52:12.850
entrepreneurial initiatives.

00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.310
I can tell you what Whole
Foods is going to do.

00:52:15.310 --> 00:52:17.730
We are creating another
foundation, we're calling it

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:19.470
the Whole Cities Foundation.

00:52:19.470 --> 00:52:24.180
We will be setting up nonprofit
stores, basically in

00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.380
these food deserts.

00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:29.340
They'll be smaller, they'll have
less capital, lower rent,

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.050
different labor model, they'll
provide a small little

00:52:32.050 --> 00:52:36.450
kitchen, and a lot of education
component to it.

00:52:36.450 --> 00:52:38.950
And any money the stores make
will get recycled back into

00:52:38.950 --> 00:52:41.710
that community.

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:43.830
Our first ones are probably
going to be in Newark,

00:52:43.830 --> 00:52:46.710
Chicago, and New Orleans.

00:52:46.710 --> 00:52:48.670
And if they're successful,
we'll probably do them

00:52:48.670 --> 00:52:49.490
everywhere.

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:52.690
By successful, meaning they
can at least break even.

00:52:52.690 --> 00:52:54.980
So I'm pretty excited
about it.

00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:59.200
My co-CEO Walter Rob, who's an
amazing guy and a force of

00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:01.560
nature, this is his
pet project.

00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:05.330
So I know with Walter behind
it, it's going to be

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.710
successful.

00:53:07.710 --> 00:53:10.320
AUDIENCE: Thanks again
for the talk.

00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.060
First, I just would like to
comment, I'm really excited

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:17.330
about your work to make
sustainability and measurement

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:20.070
more obvious and
more rigorous.

00:53:20.070 --> 00:53:23.820
Just your comment of being a
ethical vegan, could you

00:53:23.820 --> 00:53:26.420
elaborate a little more
on how that has--

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:30.240
has that been a conflict for
yourself on serving meat at

00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.400
Whole Foods?

00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.160
JOHN MACKEY: No.

00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:34.810
It's not a conflict for me.

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:37.210
It's a conflict for a lot of
other people, but it's not a

00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:37.890
conflict for me.

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.410
Because I think people have
to make their own

00:53:40.410 --> 00:53:42.020
individual food choices.

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.060
I'm not a I'm not an animal--

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:46.290
I'm not a Nazi.

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:49.660
I don't believe you force your
values on everybody else.

00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:53.940
So I think people have to make
these choices themselves, and

00:53:53.940 --> 00:53:56.180
Whole Foods is doing a lot to
educate people about the

00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:57.965
principles of healthy eating,
which is mostly

00:53:57.965 --> 00:53:59.480
a plant-based diet.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.350
And I see shifts occurring, I
see society moving towards

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.140
more plant-based foods.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:08.380
But I mean realistically,
95% of our

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.810
customers eat animal foods.

00:54:10.810 --> 00:54:12.775
Let's take a look, poll of this
room, how many people in

00:54:12.775 --> 00:54:15.860
this room are strict vegans?

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:18.580
That's a pretty good percentage,
but you're not

00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:24.340
enough to sustain a viable food
retailing business, too

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:25.660
small a cohort.

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.230
So eventually, if we get more
and more people, we'll begin

00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:29.520
to have vegan stores.

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.130
But it's just not big enough.

00:54:31.130 --> 00:54:33.445
In our own surveys, it's only
about 5% of our customers are

00:54:33.445 --> 00:54:34.370
strict vegans.

00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.460
So if we were to try to do
that, well, I wouldn't be

00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:37.990
allowed to do it.

00:54:37.990 --> 00:54:40.440
I could issue the command--

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.430
we will now stop selling meat at
Whole Foods Market, and it

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:45.230
would be ignored.

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:47.370
No, I'm serious, we're really
going to do this.

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:50.970
I'm making a command, do this,
or I'm going to fire you.

00:54:50.970 --> 00:54:52.500
There would be a call going out
to the board of directors

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:56.610
very quickly, John has finally
lost it this time.

00:54:56.610 --> 00:54:57.900
We're going to have to do
something about him.

00:54:57.900 --> 00:54:59.440
And I'd be removed.

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.310
They wouldn't let me do that,
even if I thought it was just

00:55:03.310 --> 00:55:05.480
this great [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.270
I'm an idealist, but I'm
also a pragmatist.

00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:10.310
You do what you can
do in the world.

00:55:10.310 --> 00:55:13.960
I'm not impressed with purists
who are very pure, but don't

00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.255
have any impact.

00:55:15.255 --> 00:55:17.496
They're very self-righteous,
they're very judgmental,

00:55:17.496 --> 00:55:21.460
they're very unhappy, and
they're very ineffective for

00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.710
the most part.

00:55:25.330 --> 00:55:30.280
I will give you the argument
that as a ethical vegan that

00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.370
converted me and let's say, I
converted Milton Friedman at

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:36.485
92 years of age with
this argument.

00:55:39.840 --> 00:55:43.710
So if you eat animal foods, the
animals necessarily have

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:45.800
to die before you
can eat them.

00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.690
They will die if you start
eating them and

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:48.610
they're still alive.

00:55:48.610 --> 00:55:52.730
Most the time those animals
suffered in their death.

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.680
You don't need to eat animal
foods to be extremely healthy.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.830
You can eat a complete
plant-based diet.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.940
You have to do it intelligently,
but you can do

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:01.680
it and be of vibrant health.

00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:04.630
I'm much healthier today than
I was 10 years ago,

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:07.170
15, 20 years ago.

00:56:07.170 --> 00:56:10.510
People eat animal foods
from cultural habit.

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:13.110
And because they learned to
enjoy it, it's pleasurable,

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:15.870
they like it, tastes good.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:21.040
So can you justify causing the
death of animals simply for

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:22.742
your own pleasure?

00:56:22.742 --> 00:56:25.350
Because that's what it
reduces down to.

00:56:25.350 --> 00:56:28.890
I could not and haven't had any
animal food since then.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:31.290
So other people are very casual
about it, it's like

00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:34.450
yeah, I'm on top of the food
chain, screw them.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:36.400
I'm not that way.

00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.630
But I was so impressed because
I was having dinner with

00:56:37.630 --> 00:56:39.830
Milton Friedman, and he was
asking me that very question.

00:56:39.830 --> 00:56:42.420
And I gave him that syllogism.

00:56:42.420 --> 00:56:46.480
And he got very thoughtful about
it, and he announces to

00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.780
his wife, I cannot answer
John's syllogism.

00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.620
I have no choice.

00:56:50.620 --> 00:56:52.670
I must become a vegan.

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:57.340
He's 92, and his wife goes
Milton, you're 92 years old.

00:56:57.340 --> 00:56:59.950
It's too late for us.

00:56:59.950 --> 00:57:03.070
We might as well enjoy the
last part of our lives.

00:57:03.070 --> 00:57:06.150
So I don't know, are there
any final questions?

00:57:06.150 --> 00:57:08.290
CHADE-MENG TAN: I have one
final question for you.

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:11.870
John, so if everything you do
today, and the conscious

00:57:11.870 --> 00:57:15.000
business organization, if
everything you do today

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.330
exceeds the highest
expectations, what does the

00:57:17.330 --> 00:57:18.940
world look like in 10 years?

00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:22.310
And how do I, and how do
we Google help you?

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:22.990
JOHN MACKEY: I don't
have a lot of

00:57:22.990 --> 00:57:25.800
expectations about it so--

00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.200
I'm a guy that a long time ago
made a decision in life, the

00:57:28.200 --> 00:57:30.870
most important decision I ever
made, I decided when I was

00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:34.930
about 19 years old that I would
follow my heart wherever

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:38.130
it led me, that I would
be true to myself.

00:57:38.130 --> 00:57:40.410
So I'm a great believer in
your own inner guidance.

00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:45.540
Most people are too frightened
to do that, but I decided it

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:48.150
doesn't matter whether I fall
or not, I'm going to die.

00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.940
So there's no safety in life.

00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.150
You can't get out of
this place alive.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.370
In view of that, you
ought to go for it.

00:57:55.370 --> 00:57:57.560
You ought to go for the things
that you have the great

00:57:57.560 --> 00:58:00.750
passion about because that will
lead to a great life of

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.560
adventure, adventure, passion,
love, excitement.

00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:05.620
And that's what I've
been doing.

00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:09.400
So I'm being led, I think to
do this now, it's what my

00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:10.700
heart is calling me to do.

00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:11.710
So I'm doing it.

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:12.990
So I don't have that many
expectations of

00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:15.100
what's going to happen.

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:17.150
I hope we launch a revolution.

00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:21.150
Consciousness business becomes
the thing everybody's talking

00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:22.130
about, that'd be wonderful.

00:58:22.130 --> 00:58:25.860
But if it doesn't and it only
reaches a few people, I have

00:58:25.860 --> 00:58:28.220
no doubt that conscious business
is going to triumph

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:30.630
anyway because it
works better.

00:58:30.630 --> 00:58:33.440
And the new entrepreneurs and
the young people will adopt

00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.410
this type of philosophy because
they'll win in the

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:37.150
marketplace if they do.

00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:40.585
And that reality and that fact
gives me great assurance that

00:58:40.585 --> 00:58:41.835
it will win.

00:58:44.260 --> 00:58:46.100
I am not attached
to the outcome.

00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:48.950
That gives me a certain amount
of freedom to do what I think

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:52.580
my heart's calling me to do, to
be true to that, and we'll

00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:54.550
let it evolve the way
it needs to evolve.

00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:58.810
And I'll be somewhat content
with whatever that is.

00:58:58.810 --> 00:58:59.930
CHADE-MENG TAN: And my
friends, "Conscious

00:58:59.930 --> 00:59:03.340
Capitalism", available where
books are sold, And thank my

00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:04.590
friend, John Mackey.
