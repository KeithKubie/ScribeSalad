the closing would reset the timeout and

00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:22.220
the closing would reset the timeout and
 

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.749
the closing would reset the timeout and
i did one quick test of aesthetic tag

00:15:25.749 --> 00:15:25.759
i did one quick test of aesthetic tag
 

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.519
i did one quick test of aesthetic tag
that i'd set the timeout longer to see

being a genius I don't think you can it

00:32:44.529 --> 00:32:44.539
being a genius I don't think you can it
 

00:32:44.539 --> 00:32:45.940
being a genius I don't think you can it
has to be many of these great to use it

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:45.950
has to be many of these great to use it
 

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.610
has to be many of these great to use it
be horrible I think use the column size

00:32:48.610 --> 00:32:48.620
be horrible I think use the column size
 

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.070
be horrible I think use the column size
10 you yeah but that offense the column

00:32:51.070 --> 00:32:51.080
10 you yeah but that offense the column
 

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.499
10 you yeah but that offense the column
size of the next row down as well you

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:53.509
size of the next row down as well you
 

00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:56.259
size of the next row down as well you
can't do it on a column or row basis

00:32:56.259 --> 00:32:56.269
can't do it on a column or row basis
 

00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:57.580
can't do it on a column or row basis
right I wonder if some of these are

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:57.590
right I wonder if some of these are
 

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:59.980
right I wonder if some of these are
actually individual it's just a list

00:32:59.980 --> 00:32:59.990
actually individual it's just a list
 

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:02.100
actually individual it's just a list

so int well not all the others for you

00:33:05.379 --> 00:33:05.389
so int well not all the others for you
 

00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:07.480
so int well not all the others for you
because everything's at least the same

then when you recycle it with try and
 

00:33:14.299 --> 00:33:16.090
then when you recycle it with try and
recycle the veals name types and then is

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:16.100

do I would see if you can squeeze it

00:33:19.509 --> 00:33:19.519
do I would see if you can squeeze it
 

00:33:19.519 --> 00:33:21.399
do I would see if you can squeeze it
into a list view and just do a custom

00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:21.409
into a list view and just do a custom
 

00:33:21.409 --> 00:33:23.409
into a list view and just do a custom
list items inside a list to you it'll be

00:33:23.409 --> 00:33:23.419
list items inside a list to you it'll be
 

00:33:23.419 --> 00:33:25.119
list items inside a list to you it'll be
the simplest way you and you have a lot

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:25.129
the simplest way you and you have a lot
 

00:33:25.129 --> 00:33:26.560
the simplest way you and you have a lot
of control over it and you'll get all

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:26.570
of control over it and you'll get all
 

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:30.190

be even harder oh ah risk of say you're

00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:27.910
be even harder oh ah risk of say you're
 

00:43:27.910 --> 00:43:32.730

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960
Android oh you know how lot of devices
 

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.450
Android oh you know how lot of devices
have these soft buttons at the bottom

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:39.460

with a phone search generally having
your controls right next to those is

00:43:42.210 --> 00:43:42.220
your controls right next to those is
 

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.520
your controls right next to those is
problematic in itself because you can

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:44.530
problematic in itself because you can
 

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:45.810
problematic in itself because you can
have missed touches where you're

00:43:45.810 --> 00:43:45.820

back buttons would rather than the

00:43:49.710 --> 00:43:49.720
back buttons would rather than the
 

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:50.850
back buttons would rather than the
in-app control so I generally think

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:50.860
in-app control so I generally think
 

00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:53.370
in-app control so I generally think

00:43:53.370 --> 00:43:53.380
separating away from that is good but I
 

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:54.510
separating away from that is good but I

that it's kind of a bit hard to parse

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:25.420
that it's kind of a bit hard to parse
 

00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:26.220
that it's kind of a bit hard to parse
might look

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:26.230
might look
 

00:45:26.230 --> 00:45:27.660
might look
bit complicated could you just have like

00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:27.670
bit complicated could you just have like
 

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:30.180
bit complicated could you just have like
one in the drop drop down and 11 like in

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:30.190
one in the drop drop down and 11 like in
 

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:32.280
one in the drop drop down and 11 like in
line in the control itself in the screen

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:32.290
line in the control itself in the screen
 

00:45:32.290 --> 00:45:34.830
line in the control itself in the screen
itself it's a little tricky because down

00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:34.840
itself it's a little tricky because down
 

00:45:34.840 --> 00:45:36.270
itself it's a little tricky because down
the bottom we've got a player at the

00:45:36.270 --> 00:45:36.280
the bottom we've got a player at the
 

00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:39.900
the bottom we've got a player at the
moment in the design so it's a little

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:39.910
moment in the design so it's a little
 

00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:42.240
moment in the design so it's a little
hard to have extra it is just you know

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:42.250
hard to have extra it is just you know
 

00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.590
hard to have extra it is just you know
trying to avoid adding my not

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:43.600
trying to avoid adding my not
 

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:45.540
trying to avoid adding my not
necessarily at the bottom but like a row

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:45.550
necessarily at the bottom but like a row
 

00:45:45.550 --> 00:45:49.170
necessarily at the bottom but like a row
underneath a second row below the action

00:45:49.170 --> 00:45:49.180
underneath a second row below the action
 

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.109
underneath a second row below the action
bar yeah for like a subsequent filter

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119
bar yeah for like a subsequent filter
 

00:45:51.119 --> 00:45:53.730
bar yeah for like a subsequent filter
you could do I mean trying to avoid it

00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:53.740
you could do I mean trying to avoid it
 

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.400
you could do I mean trying to avoid it
because we've also got tabs as well

already know yeah i mean that's actually

00:46:07.170 --> 00:46:07.180
already know yeah i mean that's actually
 

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.580
already know yeah i mean that's actually
a kind of separate question because i

00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:08.590
a kind of separate question because i
