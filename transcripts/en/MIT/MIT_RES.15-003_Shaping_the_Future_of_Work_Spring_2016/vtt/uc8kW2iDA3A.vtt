00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.140
Hi.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.960
I'm Meryam Bukhari, a student in
the 2016 class of the MIT Sloan

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.040
MBA program.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.960
I'm 26 years old
and a millennial.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.040
What do young workers--

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.410
millennials-- today want
from their jobs and careers?

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.300
And how do they want to
establish and maintain

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.200
a balance between work and life?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.810
These questions are
important to lots of people--

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.410
employers wanting to recruit
and keep young talented workers,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.940
millennials like me who are
about to enter the workforce,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.930
and hordes of consultants
giving us and business leaders

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.850
advice about the
changing workforce.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.840
So let's start with
what our parents told us

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.100
when we were growing up.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.050
My parents, like I would
guess many of your parents

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.120
if you're a millennial, said
that if I worked hard in school

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.030
and got a good education,
I would do well in life,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.420
even better financially
and socially than they did.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.150
But today, many
of us are worried

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.980
that our generation,
the millennials,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.750
might not achieve that goal.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.620
And if we ask young
people today if that's

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.420
what they really want
out of their careers,

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.530
we get different answers.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.220
For example, the people who
took this course last year

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.500
said that their top
probability was addressing

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.850
big, important problems
at work, while also having

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.680
a sensible work-life balance.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.610
Doing well financially
was also important.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.210
But these data, like other
surveys of young professionals,

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.200
show that it's not at
the top of the list.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.710
Hi.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.200
My name is Eileen Rivera.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.420
And I'm a third year student
at Wellesley College.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.160
I'm also a millennial about
to enter the workforce.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.200
And as you saw, there is no
one single most important

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.030
aspiration.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.750
This extended quote from
a young woman in the class

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.610
illustrates how she sees these
different aspiration fitting

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:47.110
together.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.640
"My dream includes
a job where I do

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.850
important work, something that
gives back to the community.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.620
I dream of having a work-life
balance that melds together.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.060
I hope that I'm able
to utilize technology

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.920
to make work more accessible
and eventually have the option

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.570
to do work from home.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.160
I do hope to be able to find a
company that has a retirement

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.070
plan where the
company contributes

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.560
some percentage to the plan.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.580
In some regards, I hope to
have some of the same benefits

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.770
that my parents had--

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.070
health insurance,
retirement plans, et cetera.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.910
Most importantly, I want to
have passion for my work.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.490
I want my work to help people.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.750
And I hope to make
a decent living,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.690
while making the generations
before me proud."

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.700
All this suggests that even
though our generation shares

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.010
many of the same concerns
of prior generations,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.110
we care more about having an
impact and work-life balance

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.930
and money.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.100
Our generation of
workers also looks

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.310
very different than
workforces of the past,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.820
both in America and
around the world.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.630
Almost half of Americans
today are people of color.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.200
And many millennials
here and around the world

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.310
are children of immigrants
or immigrants themselves.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.545
We will all be working together,
learning from each other,

00:02:55.545 --> 00:02:57.420
and some of us will be
starting families that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.910
blend our diverse backgrounds.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.850
So we will want our workplaces
to embrace who we are

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.710
and where we come from.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.020
But many millennials are
also having a hard time

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.920
getting started.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.210
In the US, the
majority of millennials

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.560
say we are not earning enough
money to live like we want to.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.800
More than a third of
millennials report

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.760
that we depend on our families
for financial support.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.180
So many of us have to start
out in debt from student loans

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.420
and can't find full-time
or career-building jobs

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.090
in the fields we
studied in school.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.770
How does all this affect
how and where we work?

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.680
Well, for one thing, we move
around from job to job a lot.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.370
A recent survey said
people between age 22

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.170
and 32 change jobs between one
and four times in the last five

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.850
years.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.200
And 66% expect to change jobs
again in the next few years.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110
Many of us are also
sending a clear message

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.480
that we want more opportunities,
not just for ourselves,

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.570
but for everyone regardless
of race or the income bracket

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.870
in which they were raised.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.990
That's why some are protesting
against low wages of fast food

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.660
companies, racial injustices,
and income inequality

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.410
as seen by the Occupy
Wall Street Movement

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.607
in 2011 and by protests
of women and men

00:04:05.607 --> 00:04:07.190
who are forced to
work in unacceptable

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:11.297
conditions in garment factories
in global supply chains.

00:04:11.297 --> 00:04:13.130
What does this mean for
the next generations

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.710
of managers and leaders?

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.350
Sloan School MBAs who studied
data from last year's class,

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.350
concluded that as
managers of the future,

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.150
they will need to listen
to their employees,

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.320
engage them in solving
problems that really matter

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.450
to the organization
and to society,

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.350
and be flexible in
how, when, and where

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.280
people work so they can
be productive and attend

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.120
to personal and family affairs.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.662
Those are the messages
sent by last year's class.

00:04:37.662 --> 00:04:39.120
Let's see how this
year's class can

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.494
bring our voices
into the process

00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:42.679
of shaping the future of work.
