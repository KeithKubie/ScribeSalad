something to get out why would that be

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:19.170
something to get out why would that be
 

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.960
something to get out why would that be
the first thing they say when they're

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:20.970
the first thing they say when they're
 

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.670

they're not they're not quite too much
 

00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.889
they're not they're not quite too much
for me I compare this very much to the

00:09:30.889 --> 00:09:30.899
for me I compare this very much to the
 

00:09:30.899 --> 00:09:33.620
for me I compare this very much to the
visit uh you know the visit does have a

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:33.630
visit uh you know the visit does have a
 

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:35.509
visit uh you know the visit does have a
lobby's awkward scenes and kind of

00:09:35.509 --> 00:09:35.519
lobby's awkward scenes and kind of
 

00:09:35.519 --> 00:09:37.550
lobby's awkward scenes and kind of
awkward writing and stuff but if you can

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560
awkward writing and stuff but if you can
 

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:43.069
awkward writing and stuff but if you can
if you can get through that okay for me

00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079
if you can get through that okay for me
 

00:09:43.079 --> 00:09:44.660
if you can get through that okay for me

there is definitely a reward at the end
 

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:49.220
there is definitely a reward at the end
that I thought was very clever um and if

00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:49.230
that I thought was very clever um and if
 

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:51.920
that I thought was very clever um and if

movie because there's definitely a style
 

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.970
movie because there's definitely a style
to it but it's not distracting there's

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:20.980
to it but it's not distracting there's
 

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.210
to it but it's not distracting there's
maybe shots I can think of that I'm like
