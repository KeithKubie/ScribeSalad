00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.720
Kevin Hart here.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.400
Paterson, New Jersey.

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:07.407
Of course I'm not by myself,
I'm with some funny, funny

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.208
gentlemen.

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:12.812
Ty Raney, Cee Jay Craxx, Kendall
"Shorty" Ward, and Rey Gibbs.

00:00:12.845 --> 00:00:16.516
How would you guys describe
your style of comedy?

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:17.784
It's more personable.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.054
It's about myself
and my experiences.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.156
Like coming from a--

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.590
I don't want to say a
little dude's perspective.

00:00:24.623 --> 00:00:26.125
OK.

00:00:26.158 --> 00:00:27.760
But, uh, why you
look at me like that?

00:00:27.793 --> 00:00:31.197
Why'd you say "little dude"
then make eye contact with me?

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.801
I don't-- I consider
myself a very large male.

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:35.935
Does the family
support your craft?

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.671
Are they all about the
movement, the comedy movement?

00:00:38.704 --> 00:00:40.506
Naw.

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.374
No, I mean, my--

00:00:41.407 --> 00:00:42.675
[kevin laughing]

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.243
They supported me
more when I sold drugs.

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:44.844
They don't--

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:45.812
[all laughing]

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:47.447
--no, they don't believe in me.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.515
They don't even believe
this is going on.

00:00:49.548 --> 00:00:51.784
My girl wants me to get a
job soon as this is over,

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:53.419
soon as we get back.

00:00:53.452 --> 00:00:55.488
She got Home Depot
apps on the bed.

00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:57.190
Nah, they don't believe.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:01:02.328
Do y'all feel like comedy
is more sensitive today than

00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.729
what it was back in the day?

00:01:03.762 --> 00:01:05.731
I mean, for the most part,
being younger in the game,

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:09.435
I think sometimes you want
to make sure you ain't

00:01:09.468 --> 00:01:11.604
doing the wrong thing or step on
any toes or anything like that.

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.172
Sometimes you get
rules and regulations

00:01:13.205 --> 00:01:14.306
when you get to a show.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.677
So a lot of times it just
helps you adapt, you know?

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.313
Biggest bomb moment.

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.881
Worst show ever, that's what
I want to know right now.

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:22.548
- I do prison tours as well--
- Whoa.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.784
--in Pennsylvania.
Yeah.

00:01:24.817 --> 00:01:26.219
The inmates are there,
they're chilling.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.620
There's nothing
separating us from them,

00:01:27.653 --> 00:01:29.822
it's just bleachers,
the floor, and me.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:31.124
I've done one.

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.692
I've done one.

00:01:32.725 --> 00:01:34.827
So long story short, I
wasn't getting to the funny,

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.796
or the punch of my jokes.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:37.830
And there was this
one brother that

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:39.165
was just sitting in the front.

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:40.166
He had this long
goatee and he was

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:41.134
just staring at me like this.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.202
And I was like, all
right, I'm not getting

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:44.637
any reaction from anybody.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:45.905
I just looked at him, I
was like, brother do you

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:47.507
want me to get off the stage?

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.442
He just rubbed his chin,
he said, "absolutely."

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:50.276
[all laughing]

00:01:50.309 --> 00:01:52.445
I said, that's my time.

00:01:52.478 --> 00:01:53.379
I'm Ty Raney.
I'll see you all next time.

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:54.412
That was it.
