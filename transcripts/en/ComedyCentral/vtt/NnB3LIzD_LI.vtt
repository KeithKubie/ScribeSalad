WE GOT A GUEST, A PROSPY,
STAYING THE NIGHT.

00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:11.044
- I'M MIKEY, BUT ALL MY FRIENDS
AT HOME CALL ME LEGS.

00:00:11.078 --> 00:00:12.279
- LEGS.

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:14.214
WHAT, ARE YOU ON THE TRACK TEAM
OR SOMETHING?

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.415
- OH, NO, NO.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:16.550
CANADA CANCELLED TRACK

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.719
AFTER BEN JOHNSON SHAMED
OUR COUNTRY BY CHEATING.

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:21.054
[laughter]

00:00:21.088 --> 00:00:24.491
- I GUESS WE'RE NOT USED
TO YOUR CANADIAN COMEDY.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.361

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:29.396
[babies crying]

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.498
- MACKEREL, TRIPLETS.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.067
THREE TIMES THE BLESSING.

00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:37.304
- YEAH,
AT THREE TIMES THE COST.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:38.705
- I ADMIRE YOUR STRENGTH.

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:40.474
I THOUGHT BLIND PEOPLE
WORE GLASSES.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:41.775
- OH.

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:45.445
WELL, MY BLINDNESS WAS
A PREEXISTING CONDITION,

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:49.216
SO MY INSURANCE
DOESN'T COVER IT.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.451
I HAD TO BUY THE CANE MYSELF.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.620
- PEACE OUT.

00:00:53.654 --> 00:00:54.922
[school bell rings]

00:00:54.955 --> 00:00:57.591
- SO HOW ARE YOU ENJOYING
YOUR TIME HERE SO FAR?

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:58.892
- OH, IT'S QUITE COOL.

00:00:58.926 --> 00:01:00.794
IT'S DIFFERENT
THAN OUR CAFETORIUM, THOUGH.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.229
OH, HELLO.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.331
CAN I HAVE A SOFT BOIL WITH
THE BACK BACON ON BROWN BREAD,

00:01:04.364 --> 00:01:07.835
A SACK OF KETCHUP CHIPS,
AND, UH, A BAG OF HOMO MILK?

00:01:07.868 --> 00:01:09.536
- [laughs]
HOMO MILK?

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.471

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:14.141

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.983
- YEAH.
WELL, HOW WOULD YOU STORE IT?

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.652
- WHY DON'T YOU PUT 'EM
IN CARTONS?

00:01:25.686 --> 00:01:27.087
- BECAUSE WE KEEP IT IN A BAG.

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.956
- YOU CAN'T KEEP MILK IN A BAG.

00:01:28.989 --> 00:01:30.724
- OH, HEY, TOONS.
WHERE'S BECCA?

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:31.925

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.560
NURSING FOR THREE TAKES HOURS.

00:01:33.594 --> 00:01:35.262

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:51.745

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.146
