00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.760
Gerard Fernandez: I've been
playing games all my life.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.080
It's my passion.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.160
I also learned
how to program computers,

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.640
and then in 2001,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.000
we started the first
video games company

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.400
for mobile phones in Spain
called Microjocs.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.080
In 2013, my studio was acquired
by a big company.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.480
Some of the guys and myself,

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.800
we decided that
we should do something fresh,

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.280
something new,
and we founded Omnidrone.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.400
"Titan Brawl" is
a real-time strategy game.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.040
It's considered as a MOBA.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.280
MOBA is a massive
online battle arena,

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.400
but especially designed
for mobile devices.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.280
The game is today as it is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.800
thanks to
the early access program.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.440
We changed many things

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.160
from the learnings
from the community.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.400
Since we launched the game
on early access,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.440
we got more
than 2 million installs

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.320
on Android devices.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.240
Gonzalo Fasanella: We started
in the early access program

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.160
back at
the very beginning of it.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.560
The difference
between the early access program

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.040
and a traditional soft launch
is that users are

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.880
actively giving the team
feedback.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.440
So you not only check
the metrics you have,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.120
but they also provide
possible solutions,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.240
and so you end up by doing
the game players want to play.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.880
The thing about
not having the ratings,

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.520
but having the constructive
feedback was very good.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.440
The early access was
a great opportunity

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.640
for an indie developer,
someone starting,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.120
and very key
for us in Omnidrone.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040
When we started
with early access program,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.920
we approached it
in different stages.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.680
So the idea was at the beginning

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.680
to focus on the engagement
of the games.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.040
Once we sorted that out,

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.160
we focused on the retention
of the game,

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.840
and finally,
we focused on monetization

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560
to do a valued product
for the market.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.240
We managed with early access

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.880
to improve our retention
into 41%,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.120
the engagement by 50%,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.720
and the monetization by 20%

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.160
from the very beginning
of the program

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.320
till worldwide launch
of the game.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.640
Gerard Fernandez:
I feel very happy

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.600
working on
the video games industry

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.560
because it has been my passion
since I was a child,

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.400
and it's really inspiring
that through Omnidrone

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.760
we have a real chance

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.440
to shape the new era
of the video games.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.040
