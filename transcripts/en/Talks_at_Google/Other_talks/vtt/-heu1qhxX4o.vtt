&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Perfect.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.380
Excellent, well thanks everybody for joining
us tonight.

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:09.610
My name’s Paul Snow, I’m part of the team
at YouTube here in Los Angeles.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.610
[Cheering]

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:11.680
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: Woo, Paul!

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.680
Paul!

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.760
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: And goodnight!

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:14.760
We’re good!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.760
We’re good!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.760
[Laughter]

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.300
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: We have some gentlemen up here,
as well, that deserve much more clapping than

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.300
I do.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.300
[Laughter]

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.300
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I don’t want the clap.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.300
[Laughter]

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.650
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Alright, so you can do the Arsenio
Whoop instead, so make sure you do that.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.650
[Laughter]

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.930
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Let me go down the line.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.460
Andre Royo is here visiting us as well as
David Oyelowo, we also have Eli Kelley, we

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.510
have a guy named Rick McCallum as well.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.120
And we’ve just had the opportunity--
[Applause]

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:53.059
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: So welcome to Los Angeles, welcome
to Google Los Angeles and we’ve just had

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.459
the opportunity to screen Red Tails, amazing
movie.

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:59.909
We have a few questions that we’re gonna
start out with about the movie and about your

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:01.280
experience making it.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.460
But then we have an audience here that’s
anxious to ask you questions as well.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.070
So, you guys ready?

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.070
&gt;&gt;All: Yeah.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.720
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: So first off, for those that
haven’t seen the movie yet, it’s about

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.960
Tuskegee Airmen, we’d love to hear a little
bit about your guys' experience and how you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.480
first heard about the Tuskegee Airmen.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.290
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Well for me, personally,
my first encounter, uh, of the Tuskegee Airmen

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.440
was reading the script for Red Tails.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.750
And, uh, you know that in and of itself is
something I’m ashamed to say considering

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.530
how incredible these guys were and what they
did.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.890
But at least I have the excuse of being British.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.380
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: But when I,

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.760
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: but you’re still black.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760
[Laughter]

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.960
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: He just said but I’m still
black.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.060
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: It’s true.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.110
It’s true.

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.270
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Can you believe?

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.060
You’re right, I am still black.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.060
I am still ashamed.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
Thank you.

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.060
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: But, you know when I read

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.030
the script and when I started doing research
around the subject matter, what I was shocked

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.659
to find is that a lot of Americans, both white
and black, didn’t know either.

00:02:08.659 --> 00:02:14.599
And that’s when it became a real, kind of,
obsession of mine to be both part of telling

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.360
the story and to educate people about who
they were.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.579
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: For you.

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:20.579
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Thanks.

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:27.430
I grew up in a very, very small town called
Lagrange Georgia, which is about 45 miles

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.909
Southeast of Tuskegee.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.680
So there is very rich heritage there.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.430
A lot of the airmen have said that they used
to fly over where I grew up and as we were,

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.110
you know, maturing as children, these stories
of their bravery would always be told to us

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.110
as inspiration.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.120
So it was very near and dear to me already.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.390
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: I first heard, I never heard
of the Tuskegee Airmen until 1989 and George,

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.569
a very good friend of George Lucas’ had
told him the story and, uh, he loved, he loved

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.640
battles, he loved air sequences, he had used
them in Star Wars, the original Star wars,

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.189
and he was, the minute he heard the story,
the minute he told it to me, this was '89

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:16.829
for me and he had started about a year before.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.291
It was such a no-brainer because it was just
such a fantastic story about, you know, people

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:28.060
overcoming the most extraordinary odds, but
also an action adventure story, it had a lot

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.060
of history.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.980
And one of the biggest problems that took
us so long, um,

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.469
[Audience member coughing]
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: for him to actually come

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:39.329
up with a way to make it is it was so big
cause there was the Tuskegee part, which was

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:45.299
an extraordinary story of unbelievable racism,
a tragic part of American history.

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.799
Then there’s the great part of the guys
finally getting the shot, the chance that

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:50.950
they always yearned for.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.531
And there’s also, of course, when they came
back they were treated like absolute, can

00:03:54.531 --> 00:03:55.531
we swear?

00:03:55.531 --> 00:03:56.531
[Laughter]

00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:57.531
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Sure, go for it.

00:03:57.531 --> 00:03:58.531
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Treated like absolute

00:03:58.531 --> 00:03:59.531
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: There’s kids here.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:00.531
Kids everywhere.

00:04:00.531 --> 00:04:01.531
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Oh, sorry.

00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:02.531
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: All the kids right there.

00:04:02.531 --> 00:04:03.560
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Treated very badly, very
badly.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.909
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: So there’s these three
big, big stories so, um, but it was like,

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:11.379
“Oh my God, this is just such a fantastic
idea, this is such a fantastic story,” I

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.930
never thought we’d go through the pain to
try get it made for so long, but finally it

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.270
was worth it for us.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.280
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Excellent.

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.850
So you guys have been out talking to the public
about the movie.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.940
What’s been you’re experience around their
awareness of the Tuskegee Airmen.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.913
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Well, I mean, sorry Rick.

00:04:33.913 --> 00:04:42.950
I mean, now having seen the movie, some of
it is anger, some of it is sadness that it’s,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.920
“Why, now, do we know about this?”

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:52.150
Especially for young black people that you
know, we got a letter the other day from a

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.750
school that had attended a screening and they
were angry that it wasn’t part of the curriculum

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:04.380
and that it was kind of a footnote in terms
of the things that they get to learn.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.650
At the end of the day, what we do with Red
Tails that I’m so happy about is we celebrate

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:10.810
them as heroes.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:16.480
We don’t, you know, the film isn’t about
the brow-beaten black man, which is so much

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.810
of what you can see in these kinds of movies
in a sense, often that’s what’s portrayed.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.510
But these guys, one of the privileges for
us was getting to be with Roscoe Brown, getting

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.060
to be with Lee Archer, getting to be with
Bill Holloman, some of the airmen who were

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.000
exemplary as Tuskegee airmen during the Second
World War.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.011
You know, they never let the prejudice, they
never let the obstacles that they faced, be

00:05:42.011 --> 00:05:47.560
the thing that stopped them from doing what
they wanted to do, which was to both save

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.630
the world from, you know, a dictatorship,
and show themselves worthy of respect back

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:00.110
home and show themselves to be patriotic Americans,
and they did not let the prejudice stop them.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:05.020
So, you know, this is something that as people
are getting to see that in the film, that

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:10.440
there’s a combination of celebration, anger
and sadness that it had taken this long for

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.360
them to be celebrated in this way.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.090
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: That’s great.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.500
In watching the movie there was a pretty amazing
bond between the cast.

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.270
I heard some rumors about a boot camp, or
something else that was done that maybe helped

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.080
forge some of those bonds before the filming
started.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.080
[Laughter]

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.370
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: That was the best part for
me watching.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.370
[Laughter]

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.020
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I still want to choke you
for that

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.020
[Laughter]

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.180
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: For those that had to go through
it and those that watched others go through

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.420
it, you wanna tell us a little bit about what
you did?

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:42.780
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I personally went through
boot camp and before meeting George Lucas

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:45.240
and Rick, I hated them
[Laughter]

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.540
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Because they put us through
this.

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:55.750
When I tell you –. It was a tremendous mental
struggle, physical struggle, spiritual struggle

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:01.930
cause we wanted to kill everybody that we
saw, and the worst part about it was where

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:08.130
it was set up, it was set up in an abandoned
warehouse, uh, in the winter of Prague, the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:11.880
Czech Republic, so there’s snow everywhere.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:17.730
This warehouse has no heat, nothing is modern
about this and it was how many square feet

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.730
was it?

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:20.890
It was probably about--
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: It was probably about 4 to

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.800
5,000 square feet but there were also no windows.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:26.490
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: No, no, the warehouse was
about 4 to 5,000 square foot; the place we

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.760
slept in was a closet.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.170
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: It was 8 people, the beds,

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:42.790
the beds were, um, there was about a foot's
length between each bed, we woke up; our alarm

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:46.570
clock was M80’s shot gun rifle simulations.

00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.280
We had just impromptu 9 mile hikes in the
middle of the night.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.010
People fell out, people cried.

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:54.480
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Elijah cried.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.480
[Laughter]

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.630
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: No I didn’t cry, there
was a lot of precipitation.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:02.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: in the Czech Republic at

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.980
that time of the year, David.

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:04.980
[Laughter]

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.060
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: He cried.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:12.480
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: But it was one of those experiences
that it was genius because they set it up

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:18.410
where as the Tuskegee airmen had the same
situation, they only had each other.

00:08:18.410 --> 00:08:25.240
So there was a bonding experience that you
knew when those bombs went off, that the person

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.889
right next to you was gonna have your back
regardless of what went down.

00:08:28.889 --> 00:08:35.210
And that was kind of the trajectory of how
the bond got started, because we knew, you

00:08:35.210 --> 00:08:42.610
know listen, they set us up literally in 1940,
the music was period, the food was period,

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:47.070
the way we had to interact with, there was
no social media, no cell phones, no anything

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:49.150
for over a week.

00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:54.830
And that bond, it just set us up for not only
being brothers for the duration of the movie,

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.060
but for a lifetime, in my opinion.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:09:03.279
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: And also we were very aware
that we were being afforded a completely unique

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:06.000
opportunity.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.630
I defy you to find a movie of this scale with
a, you know, almost entirely African American

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:20.220
cast where we are the center of the story.

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:25.600
You know, it’s not told through a white
person’s perspective, or a white character.

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:32.900
Like Glory did or like, you know, The Help
did, or the Last King of Scotland did, or

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:38.510
Blood Diamond did, you know, the way Hollywood
tells black stories is to do it through the

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:41.340
prism of a white perspective.

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:47.640
And so we were, you know, this is the genius
of George and why we are eternally indebted

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:52.110
to George, is that like he did with American
Graffiti took a bunch of unknowns and just

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.710
went and did it anyway, like with, you know,
Star Wars when no one was making Sci-fi at

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.580
that time, and he did it anyway.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:04.650
He did that with us, you know, no one was
gonna make this movie with a bunch of no name

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:08.570
actors so to speak, I mean, Cuba and Terrence
are a different matter.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.140
But largely the film centers around these
pilots.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:15.980
So we were very, very cognizant of the privilege
of getting to do this.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:18.010
So that was very bonding as well.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.172
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: It is cool.

00:10:19.172 --> 00:10:22.460
It was cool to walk in; I missed the boot
camp, me and Method Man

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.460
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Oh man!

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:28.650
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Thank God we were the mechanics
and we don’t gotta do all that boot camp.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:29.650
[Laughter]

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:31.550
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: But as an actor, you know, goin'
onto the set and hanging out with the guys

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.830
when we got there, you know, it was unique
to see these guys all come together every

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:36.830
morning, they were like a family.

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:40.290
It wasn’t like people off, you know, you
go to other sets other actors are doing their

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.790
thing, they’re on Facebook, they’re not
really as together as these guys were every

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:47.080
morning at the hotel, eating together, working
out together, going for a run.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.420
I took notice of that; I joined in on the
run, me and Method Man, joined in on the run.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:53.990
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: You joined in on the run,
Method Man

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:56.660
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Well, you know.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:57.660
[Laughter]

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.486
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: He joined in, thought about
it, made a rhyme about it.

00:11:00.486 --> 00:11:01.486
It was special.

00:11:01.486 --> 00:11:02.486
[Laughter]

00:11:02.486 --> 00:11:03.486
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: When he forgot his lighter
for his cigarettes.

00:11:03.486 --> 00:11:04.486
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Ah, that’s messed up.

00:11:04.486 --> 00:11:05.486
[Laughter]

00:11:05.486 --> 00:11:08.360
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: But it was cool to see these
guys, it was cool, it was cool to see these

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.700
guys connected like that.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.610
You could feel the bond was there.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.190
And they did other things like take us up
on the B51s.

00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:14.190
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Yeah!

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:17.860
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: We all went up on that and that
was, you know, horrific and scary.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:20.540
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: So we definitely had experiences

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:25.210
that put us into the moment that you don’t
really get in films.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.210
[Laughter]

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:27.210
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Excellent.

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.210
Thanks.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:31.750
So we actually have a few youth groups with
us today from More Fire Nation.

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:33.580
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: More Fire Nation.

00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:34.580
Yeah.

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:35.580
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: There we go.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.230
And we’ve got Tomorrow’s Aeronautical
Museum here as well.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.970
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Aeronauticals.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:41.970
[Laughter]

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:44.910
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I am so sorry.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.910
[Laughter]

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.410
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: We’ve come so far.

00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.420
We’ve come so far.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.920
And now we go backwards.

00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:53.920
[Laughter]

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:58.210
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: So these youths, if somebody
asked them in a year when did they hear about

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:02.060
Tuskegee Airmen, they’ll have a very different
answer than what you did at the beginning

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.060
of this conversation.

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.110
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: That’s what it’s about.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:09.150
I think essentially there are minorities in
the United States.

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:17.310
Us as a culture right now, I feel like my
generation is fixated on fame.

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:22.420
Fame without works, meaning it happens overnight.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:29.610
The opportunities that we’re granted, the
opportunities that Andre, David, myself, even

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:34.380
Rick, we fought for everything that we’ve
got.

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:41.580
And for minorities, my feeling, my vision
for these kids are to understand that these

00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:44.350
are the shoulders that you stand on.

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.339
Michael Jordan, he’s amazing.

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:50.430
Tiger Woods is amazing, LeBron James is amazing.

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:52.190
These guys are phenomenal.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:13:00.060
But to actually see these men, to see these
modern day super heroes, I always like to

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:06.440
say the only thing that separated them from
being Superman or Batman or Spiderman was

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:07.440
their mortality.

00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.440
They went out, they fought, they saved the
world, it’s just as simple as that.

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:19.070
And for them see that, for them to see someone
that looks like them do that, you can’t

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:23.010
buy that type of inspiration, that’s life
long inspiration.

00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:27.540
That’s something that no one can really
verbally instill in you, that’s something

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:28.850
that you have to see.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.820
And I think that with this movie they were
able to see that.

00:13:32.820 --> 00:13:37.190
And from what I’ve seen across the country,
and hopefully will continue to see around

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:42.830
the world, is that kids of all colors will
get inspired to see that type of bravery.

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:43.830
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Excellent.

00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.830
Well thanks.

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:48.540
Let me open it up, I know there’s questions
from the audience both from the young people

00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:50.630
that are here as well as the rest of the audience.

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:53.540
There’s a microphone we’ll pass around
so if you have a question, raise your hand.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:58.440
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: We’re not leaving this
room til 1 o’clock in the morning.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.440
[Laughter]

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.750
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Uh, I can say that one of the things
I find encouraging is that although some of

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:09.850
the older generations haven’t heard the
story of the Tuskegee Airmen, I think, at

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.160
least, starting with my generation, I think
it’s something that’s starting to be taught

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.400
a lot more in schools.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:19.850
I mean, I grew up in Tennessee, which is not
exactly the most forward thinking of places,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:26.370
but even still I remember hearing about the
Tuskegee Airmen several times throughout middle

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:27.590
school and high school.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:32.590
But I’m also curious to hear how you guys
think this will be received by the international

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:38.370
community, especially you David as a Brit,
because it is a, although a very American

00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:46.920
story, it is also something that is very unique
to, uh, just on a human level, and a level

00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:48.360
of world history.

00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:54.210
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Well, I think one of the
things that drew George to wanting to make

00:14:54.210 --> 00:15:00.810
it is he recognized the universal truth in
terms of what these men did.

00:15:00.810 --> 00:15:07.600
We all face obstacles, whether it’s bullying
at school, whether it’s being a woman, whether

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.410
it’s being black or any sort of minority.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:15.250
Or just being alive on earth today you face
obstacles.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.790
And the great thing about the story, from
a universal point of view, like I’ve said

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:25.240
before is that they didn’t dwell on the
negative.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:31.899
They knew what they had, by way of talent,
they worked hard on it, and they went out

00:15:31.899 --> 00:15:35.330
and did their best every single time.

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:43.000
And also the universal truth, there’s a
beautiful biblical quote which is, “Greater

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.970
love hath no man than to lay his life down
for his friend.”

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:53.310
And that, to me, is the definition of love,
you know, to be prepared to lay down your

00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:58.320
life for another person, for your country,
for your family.

00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.019
If we all had that, to some degree, within
us, you know, I am absolutely certain the

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:06.160
world would be a better place.

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:12.820
And that’s why so often the war years are
called the “Great Generation” or “The

00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:18.340
Finest Generation” because that was a time
where just because of the circumstances, these

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:25.470
people had to put their lives on the line
for truth, for justice and for their countries,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:27.830
for the things that really mean so much.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:32.990
And what Elijah is alluding to, in terms of
the generation that we live in now, is that

00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:37.990
those kinds of pressures are certainly not
put on Western youth, you know, they’re

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:38.990
not.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:44.769
We are free to be obsessed with ourselves,
with our technology, with what we look like

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:51.529
and with the idea of fame, because there isn’t
that pressure placed upon us to, you know,

00:16:51.529 --> 00:16:53.120
look out for our fellow man.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:59.170
So that is, I think, the universal truth within
Red Tails that I hope that anyone alive today

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:07.030
would see, regardless of whether you’re
American or black or other race.

00:17:07.030 --> 00:17:14.670
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Okay, I have one question.

00:17:14.670 --> 00:17:22.880
Was it fun when you were a pretty boy?

00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:23.880
[Laughter]

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.920
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: [Inaudible]

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.570
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: That’s a great question.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.000
You know what, the,
[Laughter]

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.610
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Honestly, this is one of
the great things about being an actor is that,

00:17:38.610 --> 00:17:45.800
you know, as you guys know, as those of you
here that are kids, going around your house

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.010
going
[Gun sounds]

00:17:47.010 --> 00:17:49.040
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: You know you do that anyway.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:52.549
No one has to be paying you to do that.

00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:54.950
We literally got paid.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.950
Literally.

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.220
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I didn’t do that.

00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.350
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: He cried and did
[Gun noises]

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:02.110
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Why you keep telling people
I cried?

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:07.730
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Because you gotta tell the
people the truth.

00:18:07.730 --> 00:18:08.730
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Listen man.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.730
[Laughter]

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:10.730
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: The truth will set you free.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:11.730
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: It will, but, let us just.

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:13.010
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: it’s okay, they’ll still
think you’re cool.

00:18:13.010 --> 00:18:14.920
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: But literally because we

00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920
had to

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.130
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: [Inaudible]

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.200
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Because we obviously weren’t
up there flying, we were in a Gimbal, so it’s

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:28.360
a section of the plane that’s on poles that’s
being manipulated by these guys.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.770
Because we had to learn each battle, so you
had to learn which plane was going where,

00:18:32.770 --> 00:18:36.640
where you were looking at any given time,
which was really mind numbing by the way.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.799
But it was so much fun, because literally
we were in there and someone off camera was

00:18:40.799 --> 00:18:42.710
going, “B boys comin' at ya!”

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:44.309
[Gun Noises]
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: “Boom!

00:18:44.309 --> 00:18:45.309
Boom!

00:18:45.309 --> 00:18:46.309
Boom!”

00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:47.309
[Gun noises]
[Laughter]

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:49.110
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: “Look to your left, look
to your left!”

00:18:49.110 --> 00:18:51.590
[Gun noises]
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: So every time you see me

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:57.110
go, “Whoa!” like that, it’s because
Nate Parker, is literally sat down there going,

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:58.360
“Look to your right!”

00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.360
“Whoa!”

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:00.360
“Here he comes again!”

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.360
“Whoa!”

00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:04.390
[Gun noises]
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: So the answer to your question

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:06.280
is it was great fun.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:09.920
Pretty Boy wasn’t actually there, but visualizing
him and getting to shoot at him and getting

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.309
to do the trick where I do the flip and all
that.

00:19:12.309 --> 00:19:17.140
I mean really I couldn’t believe that I
was going home to a paycheck after a day like

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.140
that.

00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.429
So yeah, it was very fun.

00:19:19.429 --> 00:19:21.650
&gt;&gt;Male #3: When Deacon was going down on his
plane, what would go through your mind if

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:24.100
you knew you was gonna die, or you’d be
in really bad condition if you survived?

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.860
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Oh wow.

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:28.240
That’s a

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.679
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Very heavy duty.

00:19:31.679 --> 00:19:35.820
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: That is heavy duty.

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:36.820
[Laughter]

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.429
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: These kids is real smart.

00:19:40.429 --> 00:19:43.049
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: It is heavy duty.

00:19:43.049 --> 00:19:46.280
Well, the first thing that you do, obviously,
is

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.480
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Wet yourself.

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.680
That’s what I’d do.

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.680
[Laughter]

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:50.680
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Um,

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.680
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Gather some fuel.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.680
[Laughter]

00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:59.940
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I don’t know, for me, that,
a lot of things flashes in real life.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:06.760
I feel like a character like Deke, with his
spirituality, he would probably think about

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.429
what he’s left on earth.

00:20:08.429 --> 00:20:14.390
What kind of example he’s left for the people
around him, the family that he’s leaving.

00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:21.760
Um, for me personally, I would just want to
be fulfilled in everything that God had called

00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:23.070
me to do.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:28.160
Death is, I can be very candid, it’s not
something I look forward to.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:36.710
I’m terrified, just of the fact of losing
life, nobody knows what that entails.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:44.590
I think that what is inspired by the possibilities
of that is to be as great as you can while

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:46.100
you have life.

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:51.299
So that transition is as easy as it can be
knowing that you’ve done everything that

00:20:51.299 --> 00:20:56.820
you could for everybody that you can while
you’re here on earth.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:57.820
[Applause]

00:20:57.820 --> 00:21:07.660
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I just wanted to take a quick moment
at this moment it’s a great moment that

00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:08.660
was an awesome word.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:10.000
Thank you guys so much for making this film.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.620
All my kids are so grateful, uh, I’m speaking
on behalf of More Fire Nation, they’re all

00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:16.160
just really glad that y'all didn’t actually
die.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160
[Laughter]

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.300
&gt;&gt;Male #4: You guys are really alive.

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:28.080
So, they were asking on the way here, “Did
they really die?”

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:33.290
“No they didn’t, they’re gonna,”
[Laughter]

00:21:33.290 --> 00:21:36.850
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Red team go!

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:37.850
[Laughter]

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:41.830
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Before they crashed, like a second
before it hit the ground, how did the pilot

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:42.830
get out and survive?

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:43.830
&gt;&gt;Male #6: I think what he’s saying is that
the special effects

00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:44.830
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Look so real.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:47.040
&gt;&gt;Male #6: look so real that they are convinced
that those airplanes

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.040
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Really crashed?

00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040
Yeah.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.200
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Like, if those airplanes actually
crashed

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.510
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: How’d he get the heck outta
there?

00:21:57.510 --> 00:22:01.020
How’d he get outta there?

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.120
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Oh!

00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:10.524
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: There were many times when
I wanted the plane to crash.

00:22:10.524 --> 00:22:11.524
[Laughter]

00:22:11.524 --> 00:22:12.524
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: They were only 4 feet off
the ground so that was really hard.

00:22:12.524 --> 00:22:14.030
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I only have like 60 degree
burns, I mean I’m still

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.030
[Laughter]

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:16.030
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I’m still suffering man.

00:22:16.030 --> 00:22:17.030
[Laughter]

00:22:17.030 --> 00:22:18.030
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: It’s hard out there for
a pilot.

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.030
[Laughter]

00:22:19.030 --> 00:22:21.860
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Well, that means we did our
job well that you think that we were actually,

00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.420
I was never anywhere near an explosion.

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:25.420
[Laughter]

00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:28.380
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: That’s where the joy of
all the

00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:29.380
[Gun noises]

00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.380
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: That’s where it would have
ended.

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.380
[Laughter]

00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.380
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Blow that up!

00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.380
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.440
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Eatin' Twizzlers.

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.440
[Laughter]

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:42.429
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: That was all make believe.

00:22:42.429 --> 00:22:48.680
One of the great things about doing this film
with Rick and George and Lucas Films is that

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:55.260
they also own a company called ILM, Industrial
Light and Magic, who are some of the best

00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.750
in the world at computer generated imagery.

00:22:57.750 --> 00:23:04.650
So that make that stuff look so real, that
when I watched the movie I was like, the first

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:09.170
time I watched the movie, I’m gonna admit
this now, I got choked up about my own death.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:10.170
[Laughter]

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:11.500
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: That’s how real, I’m
serious.

00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.960
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: I did good!

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960
I did good!

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:14.960
[Laughter]

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.920
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I was sittin' behind him.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.190
And he was like, “Elijah, didn’t I die
really well?”

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.190
[Laughter]

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:23.740
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: “it was a great death”

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:24.740
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Beautiful!

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:32.820
No, I’m serious, I had like a lump in my
throat, I was like, and that’s a testament

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:34.179
to the great work that you guys do.

00:23:34.179 --> 00:23:36.480
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: The first time I sent you
the trailer, remember?

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:37.770
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:38.990
I watched it with my kids.

00:23:38.990 --> 00:23:43.960
Can you imagine, I have 3 sons, I have a 10-
year- old, a 7- year –old and a 3- year-

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.919
old, and can you understand how much of a
hero I am in my house?

00:23:48.919 --> 00:23:54.179
When I show them that trailer, “That’s
my Dad!”

00:23:54.179 --> 00:23:57.620
The best, the best.

00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:02.290
I don’t think we answered your question
but it was fun anyway.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:03.290
[Laughter]

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:09.010
&gt;&gt;Male #7: After realizing what the Tuskegee
airmen meant and what they did, as you being

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:11.330
asked to play a character of the Tuskegee
airmen, how did that feel for you?

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:19.150
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Well, now you have to keep
in mind that these guys, we got to meet these

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:28.280
men, these amazing men, who are as sharp,
as smart and as tactful as they are now as

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.870
they were then.

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:35.760
So you’re coming up to them every day and
literally Roscoe Brown would come up to you

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760
and look at you, “We didn’t wear our jackets
like this.

00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.760
There you go!”

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:41.530
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: And they have the like strongest

00:24:41.530 --> 00:24:49.450
grandfather hands that just grip you in ways
that you just don’t understand.

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:53.650
And they’re like 89-90 years old.

00:24:53.650 --> 00:24:59.720
So the greatest thing about it is you’re
getting firsthand information of how to portray

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720
them.

00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:06.070
The most frightening thing is if you don’t
do it right, those grapple hooks will come

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:10.780
out of nowhere and just grab you and tell
you what you’re doing right and what you’re

00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.020
doing wrong.

00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:17.010
They have this incredible quote, I don’t
wanna misquote it.

00:25:17.010 --> 00:25:21.470
It begins with, “Excellence,” Roscoe Brown
always says that, “Excellence is the only

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:22.470
answer to,” Uh, what is it?

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:23.470
To ignorance or?

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:25.850
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Ignorance and mediocrity.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:29.690
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Yes, “Excellence is the
only answer to ignorance and mediocrity.”

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:35.450
So that was the format and the equation that
they preached to us all the time.

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:38.050
“Just be excellent, you’re doing great.

00:25:38.050 --> 00:25:39.360
Just be excellent.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.690
Just be excellent through adversity to the
stars.”

00:25:42.690 --> 00:25:49.100
That’s how we got to the point to deliver
a film like Red Tails like we did.

00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:54.190
And, more than anything it was just an honor
for them to be able to teach us.

00:25:54.190 --> 00:26:01.770
We had an incredible director in Anthony Hemingway,
the creative side with Rick and George, as

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.770
well.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:09.120
But to know that these heroes that you’re
portraying are right behind camera, rooting

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:14.130
for you, you know, the feeling was unparalleled.

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:17.120
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Yeah it was a great responsibility
and pride.

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:22.220
My remembrance of being at the ranch with
a couple of the Tuskegee airmen and we were

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.919
asking the questions on, “What’d you do
here?”

00:26:23.919 --> 00:26:27.850
“What’d you think about this?” and one
of the cats asked them, “How’d you say

00:26:27.850 --> 00:26:28.850
hi to somebody?

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:29.850
Did you give them dap?

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:30.850
Did you give them a hand?

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:31.850
Did you bump their shoulders?”

00:26:31.850 --> 00:26:39.160
And this dude was like, “No, we walked up,
we shook their hand and we moved on.”

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.910
“So what?”

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:41.910
[Laughter]

00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:45.380
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: And it was just like, everybody
started sitting up like, “Oh shit!”

00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:46.380
“For real, my fault, my fault.”

00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:47.380
And you know, like Elijah said, they were
so proud of their story being told it made

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.049
us feel so proud that we were allowed to tell
their story.

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:53.380
And the two together, it was just you know,
memorable.

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:55.150
It was a fantastic experience.

00:26:55.150 --> 00:26:58.140
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: But we also learned that
they’re show offs as well.

00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.581
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Well, they got the right.

00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:00.581
They got the right to.

00:27:00.581 --> 00:27:03.559
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I did so many interviews
with Roscoe where, especially if there’s

00:27:03.559 --> 00:27:14.539
a pretty young lady, he’ll go, “You know
when there was lightening that blows up the

00:27:14.539 --> 00:27:16.470
train?

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.470
That was me.

00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:18.470
I did that.

00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:19.470
Get the record straight.”

00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:20.470
[Laughter]

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:21.470
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: [Inaudible]
[Laughter]

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.470
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Oh!

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:23.470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:27:23.470 --> 00:27:24.470
“I flew so low I bent my wing.”

00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:25.470
[Laughter]

00:27:25.470 --> 00:27:26.470
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I was like, “Real—yeah.”

00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:27.470
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: He waited a long time to say
it.

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:28.470
He waited like years.

00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:29.470
[Laughter]

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:30.470
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Yeah.

00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:31.470
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: You guys think this is a
spectacle to see them right now?

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.470
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Oh my goodness.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:33.470
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: It’s like you’re a 91-year-old
telling an 89-year-old to shut up because

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:34.700
they’re too young to talk.

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:37.400
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: it’s like that type of

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.400
stuff.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:39.400
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Literally.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.020
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: You know, it’s like people
telling lies about who dated Lena Horne.

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:45.260
It’s like that’s the types of things that
go on.

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:46.260
[Laughter]

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:47.260
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: “I danced with her all
night!”

00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.260
“No you didn’t!”

00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.260
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: “Shut up!

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:50.260
You didn’t dance with Lena Horne.”

00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:51.260
&gt;&gt;David Oyelow: “No you didn’t.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.260
You didn’t dance with Lena Horne.

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.260
How come I danced with her?”

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:54.260
“Okay.”

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:55.260
[Laughter]

00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.794
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: So we probably have time for
one or two more questions.

00:27:59.794 --> 00:28:00.794
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Well, we’re cool.

00:28:00.794 --> 00:28:01.794
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Great.

00:28:01.794 --> 00:28:04.940
&gt;&gt;Male #8: How did you feel when you had to
fix the P51 D Mustang?

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.560
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: I felt incompetent.

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.350
[Laughter]
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: I felt like I didn’t know

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.350
what I was doing.

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.900
Again, they gave us a lot of research.

00:28:13.900 --> 00:28:16.090
We were at an air museum.

00:28:16.090 --> 00:28:17.840
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Plane and Fame.

00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:21.890
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Plane and Fame and I dealt with
some mechanics, they walked me around, they

00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:25.470
taught me, gave me big, big books on how to
do it.

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:28.510
And there was no way in hell I could learn
that quick before we shot.

00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:32.559
But, you know, it wasn’t really about the
plane as much as it was about somebody else’s

00:28:32.559 --> 00:28:33.559
life.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:37.660
If I don’t do this plane right it might
cost my fellow man his death.

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:42.580
So it was very personal to really go through
that plane and be very precise on every part

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:45.230
of the plane to make sure it worked well for
the pilot.

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:50.240
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Which is why I died, cause
he didn’t know.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:51.240
[Laughter]

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.240
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: [Inaudible]

00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.890
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Oh man.

00:28:53.890 --> 00:28:59.250
&gt;&gt;Female #1: How did it feel to be a Tuskegee
Airmen?

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:02.614
Did it feel like you were a kid again playing
make believe?

00:29:02.614 --> 00:29:05.340
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Well like Elijah said, they
were heroes.

00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:07.770
They flew, saved the world.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:16.970
They were young and it was just, it was a
once in a lifetime opportunity, one that we’ll

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.630
take to our graves.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:24.669
I mean, one of the highlights for us was we
got to take the film to the Whitehouse and

00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:26.330
we got to screen it for the president.

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.200
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: And the first lady.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.890
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: And the first lady.

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:37.370
And what was so incredible, was we had a tour
of the Whitehouse before we showed it to them

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:42.910
and you know the Whitehouse with all that
history and with all these fusty white men

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.200
and their wigs and things like that through
the years.

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.500
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Rick and George.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.500
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Old and Balding.

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:49.500
[Laughter]

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.951
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I cannot believe you just
said that.

00:29:52.951 --> 00:29:53.951
[Laughter]

00:29:53.951 --> 00:29:54.951
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: The movie is over.

00:29:54.951 --> 00:29:55.951
We got paid.

00:29:55.951 --> 00:29:56.951
[Laughter]

00:29:56.951 --> 00:29:57.951
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: We got paid.

00:29:57.951 --> 00:29:58.951
We got a movie.

00:29:58.951 --> 00:29:59.951
[Laughter]

00:29:59.951 --> 00:30:06.460
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: But it was just so incredible
to be in that building with all that history,

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:13.080
both negative and positive, and then to be
standing in a room waiting for the president,

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.299
and for this cool guy to come in and go,
[Clap]

00:30:16.299 --> 00:30:17.900
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: “How y'all doin’?”

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:18.900
[Laughter]

00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:21.100
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: And you’re like, “Is
that the president?”

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:22.100
[Laughter]

00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:27.179
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: And he walked in and Michelle
Obama's giving hugs and the real Tuskegee

00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:28.179
Airmen were there.

00:30:28.179 --> 00:30:29.740
And you know, everywhere you looked there
were black faces.

00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:31.919
You could almost see those paintings going.

00:30:31.919 --> 00:30:32.919
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Melting.

00:30:32.919 --> 00:30:33.919
“I’m melting!

00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:34.919
I’m melting!

00:30:34.919 --> 00:30:35.919
What are they doing?”

00:30:35.919 --> 00:30:36.919
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Especially the Kennedy ones
[Laughter]

00:30:36.919 --> 00:30:40.640
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: That’s right.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:46.090
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: I didn’t mean that far.

00:30:46.090 --> 00:30:48.630
I didn’t mean that far.

00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:49.630
[Laughter]

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.281
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: So, you know, to get to do
the movie and then to get to see the

00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:53.669
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: And they served us popcorn.

00:30:53.669 --> 00:30:55.590
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: And the little cookies, little
plane cookies in the Whitehouse.

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.620
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: And M and Ms. Remember the M
and Ms?

00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.620
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Yeah!

00:30:58.620 --> 00:30:59.620
It was incredible.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:04.169
So the combination of getting to play those
men, getting to see them honored at the Whitehouse,

00:31:04.169 --> 00:31:08.050
being there while they’re, having this movie
come out while there is an African American

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:12.660
president, it’s just like stuff you’ll
tell your grandkids, you’ll take to your

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:14.740
grave, it was just the most incredible experience.

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:16.150
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Yo!

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:21.440
All my little brothers, this is not only a
movie, this is a movement.

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:27.570
This is something we want you guys to take
and cherish for the rest of your lives.

00:31:27.570 --> 00:31:29.510
You’re a part of this as well as us.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:32.780
We did this for and with you guys.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.929
Every day that we did this film we had people
like you in mind.

00:31:36.929 --> 00:31:42.070
And I never would have known that we would
have got to take the film to the Whitehouse.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:46.330
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: One of the best things that
has happened to me during the course of this

00:31:46.330 --> 00:31:53.309
experience is the guy who literally put this
bandage on me, you know from the ankle abrasion

00:31:53.309 --> 00:32:00.250
that I just had, said that he took his dad
to see Red Tails and it was the first time

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:03.960
his dad had been to the movie theater since
he saw Gandhi, thirty years ago.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:04.960
[Laughter]

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.960
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: He’s got good taste.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.700
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Yeah, “If I’m gonna see
a movie, it’s gonna be a good movie!”

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.300
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: “A movie like Gandhi!”

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:13.300
[Laughter]

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:18.320
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: So, you know, I mean that
was like in the early '80s, so that bears

00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:19.320
out what you’re saying

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.320
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Yes.

00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:22.919
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: This is truly something that
people feel an ownership of in a different

00:32:22.919 --> 00:32:24.540
way, you know, which is great.

00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:31.860
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: It creates a very honest
dialogue that can evolve into so many other

00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:34.029
things, and that’s great.

00:32:34.029 --> 00:32:39.179
You know, how many times have we heard people
say that men don’t know how to communicate?

00:32:39.179 --> 00:32:46.919
So for a 10-year-old kid talking to his 60-year-old
grandfather and they meet somewhere in the

00:32:46.919 --> 00:32:51.520
middle and get to share amazing stories that,
you know, these stories of triumph are timeless.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:55.590
Where like you said, whether you’re dealing
with bullying or that father who was dealing

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:58.720
with some kind of racial injustice, these
stories coincide with each other.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.370
And yeah, I never thought about that.

00:33:01.370 --> 00:33:04.200
It does bridge that gap.

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:09.560
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: And how often do you go to
the movie theater and see someone so dark

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.560
and sexy?

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:11.560
[Laughter]

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:12.560
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: You know it.

00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:13.560
Preach it.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:14.560
Preach it.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.560
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Like Elijah Kelley in a plane.

00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:22.320
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Pause, but preach it!

00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:23.570
[Laughter]

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:29.170
&gt;&gt;Male #9: When you first heard Ne-Yo’s
voice when he was acting did you laugh?

00:33:29.170 --> 00:33:30.170
[Laughter]

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:34.309
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Cut the camera!

00:33:34.309 --> 00:33:37.950
Cut the Camera!

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:42.970
Wow, this one, he’s on fire!

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:43.970
No.

00:33:43.970 --> 00:33:48.830
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Rick, over to you.

00:33:48.830 --> 00:33:50.810
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: Absolutely not.

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:55.260
I still don’t understand a single word he
said in the film but I never laughed.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.260
[Laughter]

00:33:56.260 --> 00:34:01.450
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: There is the 5 P’s.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:05.679
Prior preparation prevents poor performance.

00:34:05.679 --> 00:34:11.710
And when you are, we say it a lot in our generation,
when you’re on your grind, when you’re

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:15.050
knowing everything that you’re supposed
to know, when you have everything that’s

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.920
intact, the minute somebody questions you
about what you know, there’s an immediate

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:22.429
rebuttal in the right way.

00:34:22.429 --> 00:34:26.941
And whatever notion that was had about you
before then is canceled and there’s a new

00:34:26.941 --> 00:34:35.310
beginning right there because you are so intelligence
and you’re so mentally able to talk intelligently

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:40.750
and articularly, articulate about everything
that you’ve consumed, all the knowledge

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:47.640
that you’ve had, the bank of hard drive
that you’ve been acquiring over the years.

00:34:47.640 --> 00:34:49.869
You’re on and you’re ready.

00:34:49.869 --> 00:34:54.419
And that’s another thing that, you know,
the Tuskegee Airmen stood for, that was something

00:34:54.419 --> 00:34:59.180
that resonated all the way from just the mood
of who they were to coming on set and knowing

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.180
exactly what to do while we were there.

00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:06.160
And again that’s prior preparation prevents
poor performance.

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:15.450
&gt;&gt;Female #2: Was it hard for you to change
your voice in the movie to make it sound straight

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:16.450
English?

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:17.450
[Laughter]

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.190
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Make your voice sound right
and regular, David!

00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:21.380
It’s strange right?

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.380
[Laughter]

00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:24.930
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: What are you trying to say?

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.870
&gt;&gt;Female #2: To talk like that in the movie.

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:27.870
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Oh, okay.

00:35:27.870 --> 00:35:29.170
Well, that’s a compliment, I’ll take that.

00:35:29.170 --> 00:35:32.690
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: You know he thinks he’s
smarter than everybody because he talks like

00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:33.690
that.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:34.690
[Laughter]

00:35:34.690 --> 00:35:37.070
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: This is Elijah’s inferiority
complex.

00:35:37.070 --> 00:35:38.070
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: See!

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:41.080
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Every time I talk to him,
“I know what you’re doin’ David, you

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.080
think you’re so smart!”

00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:43.080
[Laughter]

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:53.010
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Let me tell you, David, in
my opinion is one of the most incredible actors

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:54.010
of our generation.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:36:02.930
It’s a testament to your, compliment, he
goes in so hard and he devotes himself at

00:36:02.930 --> 00:36:13.410
a very, very, very, very interesting and accurate
pace that I haven’t seen from a lot of people.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:20.790
And it’s something that a lot of people
on set learned from me, personally, and he’s

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:24.650
one of brightest stars in my eyes, performing
on screen.

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:32.240
I know that you guys lit up every time that
you saw Lightening and the strength that he

00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240
brought to the movie.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:43.050
And he’s an amazing performer; you’ll
see so much more of him.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:44.790
[Applause]

00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:49.599
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: I need 10 percent from the
rest of your movies.

00:36:49.599 --> 00:36:50.599
[Laughter]

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:51.599
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: Yeah, I’ll tell ya later.

00:36:51.599 --> 00:36:52.599
Yeah.

00:36:52.599 --> 00:36:53.599
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: 10 percent.

00:36:53.599 --> 00:36:54.599
[Laughter]

00:36:54.599 --> 00:36:55.599
&gt;&gt;David Oyelowo: I’ll hit you back.

00:36:55.599 --> 00:36:56.599
[Laughter]

00:36:56.599 --> 00:36:57.599
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: Alright.

00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.599
Andre, David, Eli, Rick.

00:36:58.599 --> 00:36:59.599
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Elijah!

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:00.599
You called me Eli man!

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:01.599
[Laughter]

00:37:01.599 --> 00:37:02.599
&gt;&gt;Paul Snow: I’m sorry.

00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:03.599
&gt;&gt;Andre Royo: Chill out.

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:04.599
Chill out.

00:37:04.599 --> 00:37:05.599
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: It’s black history month.

00:37:05.599 --> 00:37:06.599
&gt;&gt;Rick McCallum: That is so white.

00:37:06.599 --> 00:37:07.599
[Laughter]

00:37:07.599 --> 00:37:08.599
&gt;&gt;Elijah Kelley: Tuskegee Airmen, and he’s
gonna mess up my name on live internet.

00:37:08.599 --> 00:37:09.599
[Laughter]
