00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 ah 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.529
 now 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:41.610
 and have hot water and cold water 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.610
 at the same time as you want is perfect 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.410
 or the people that when I go we're 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.740
 always very happy because they do the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740
 shower 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.699
 the environment system the materials 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.470
 that we use are typical materials that in 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.940
 the neighborhood is discarded or burned 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.910
 because they have no final disposal of the 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.620
 trash then the letters we show you 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.240
 to families that with materials that 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.710
 before they burned they can have an access a 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.710
 basic service that they did not have to play 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.820
 the truth that I changed 100% so 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.299
 least I will have 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.969
 let's say hot water for my children not 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.460
 I have words to describe what 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:44.369
 they are doing for me the truth that no 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.610
 I can not believe the water issue yet 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.610
 hot 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.130
 The goal of the project is to be able to reach 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.470
 thousands of families not only in Argentina 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.920
 but in Latin America think that one day 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.060
 of rain and 35 people who 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.340
 voluntarily they come to learn about 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.170
 sustainability to work with 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.180
 family with the neighbors of the neighborhood and 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.950
 especially the most important thing to see the 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.300
 the youngest of the neighborhood working the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.300
 true that really without alcohol
