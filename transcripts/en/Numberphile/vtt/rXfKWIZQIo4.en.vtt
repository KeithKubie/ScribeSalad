00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.380
So we're going to talk about a problem

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.510
in geometry and it's called the moving

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.759
sofa problem. So the problem is inspired

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.189
by the real life problem of moving

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.440
furniture around. It's called - named after

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.480
sofas but it can be anything really. You

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.620
have a piece of furniture you're

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.269
carrying down a corridor in your house

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.900
or down some whatever place and you need

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.029
to navigate some obstacles. So one of the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.580
simple situations in capturing that

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.460
would be when you have a turn, a right turn,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.230
in the corridor. You need to move the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.090
sofa around. We're modeling this in two

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.920
dimensions so let's say the sofa is so

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.480
heavy you can't even lift it up you can

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.860
only push it around on the floor.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.690
Obviously some sofas will fit around the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.820
corner some will not and people started

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.710
asking themselves at some point: what is

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.510
the largest sofa you can move around the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.160
corner? So that's the question: what is

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.890
the sofa of largest area. [Brady]: Largest area,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.440
not longer [?] [Prof. Romik]: Not longest, not heaviest,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.100
just largest area. [Brady]: OK. [Prof. Romik]: not most comfortable

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.219
So here's an example of one of the most simple sofas you can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.500
imagine so it has a semi circular shape

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.120
and we push it down the corridor so

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.680
let's see what happens we push it until

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.589
it meets the opposite wall and now we

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.479
rotate it and of course because it's a

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.060
semicircle it can rotate just perfectly

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.400
and now it's in the other corridor so

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.049
you can push it forward. [Brady]: and what's the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.700
area of that one? Like is that a good area? [Prof. Romik]: First

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.840
of all we have to say that we choose

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.939
units where the width of the corridor is

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.590
one unit let's say one metre or

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.170
something like that then the semicircle

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.810
have radius one so I'm sure all your

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.490
viewers know that the area would be PI

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.619
over 2 because that's the area of a semi

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.840
circle with radius 1. Now whether that's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.150
good or not that's that's up to you it's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.650
not the best that you can do for sure

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.079
but it is what it is. So the next one

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.840
that I have here looks like this so it's

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.579
still a fairly simple geometric shape

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.250
and it was proposed by British

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.350
mathematician named John Hammersley in

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.840
1968. By the way, I should mention that

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.990
the problem was first asked in 1966 by a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.329
mathematician named Leo Moser. Let's

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.649
first of all check that it works and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.750
then I'll explain to you why it works. I'm

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.759
so you see you can push it and again it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.649
meets the wall and now we start rotating

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.240
it but while you're rotating it you're

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.549
also pushing it so you're doing like

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.989
this and it works perfectly now the idea

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.290
behind this hammersley sofa is you go

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.920
back to the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.200
previous one which is the semi-circular one

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.670
and you should imagine

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.410
cutting up the semicircle into two

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.510
pieces which are both quarter circles

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.760
and then pulling them apart and then

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.440
there's a gap between them and you fill

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.750
up this gap. Now, in order to make it work

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.040
so that you can move it around the

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.140
corner, you have to carve out a hole.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.420
Because that's what you need to do the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.400
rotation part and Hammersley noticed, and

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.270
this is a very simple geometric

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.700
observation, is that if the hole is semi

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.190
circular in shape then everything will

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.810
work the way it should and so it can

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.430
move around the corner and he also

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.050
optimized that particular parameters

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.269
associated with how far apart you want

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.519
to push the two quarter circles and so on.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.920
And then you work out the area of the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.870
overall area of the sofa and it comes

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.230
out to two pi over 2 plus 2 over pi. So

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.600
slightly more exotic number. Definitely

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.430
an improvement, right? Well that wasn't

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.900
the end of the story as it turns out.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.700
Hammersley wasn't sure if his sofa was

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.040
optimal or not. He thought it might be,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.200
people shortly afterwards noticed that

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.900
it's not, and only 20 something years

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.239
later, somebody came up with something

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.329
that is better - it's not really

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.950
dramatically better because the area is

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.440
only slightly bigger but it's dramatically

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.540
more clever, I would say. So this is a

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:26.220
construction that was discovered later

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.030
in '92 and it looks very similar to

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.730
the sofa that Hammersley proposed but

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.769
it's not identical. So it's subtly

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.930
different from it. Well here you see this

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.810
curve is a semicircle. Right? Here, we're

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.340
doing something a bit more sophisticated

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.380
so you see we've polished off a little

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.079
bit of the sharp edge here and also this

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.820
curve is no longer a semicircle it's

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.290
something mathematically more

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.840
complicated to describe and this this

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.850
curve on the outside here is no longer a

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.030
quarter circle. In fact it's a curve

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.650
that is made up by gluing together

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.800
several different mathematical curves.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.940
So this shape is quite elaborate to describe.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.380
The boundary of it is made up

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.019
of 18 different curves that are glued

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.720
together in a very precise way. [Brady]: Cool [Prof. Romik]: And,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.720
well, let's see it in action. [Brady]: Yeah! [Prof. Romik]: Okay so

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.880
we put it here we push it and you see, I mean

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.459
it looks roughly the same as what

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:18.870
happens with Hamersley's sofa, except

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.609
the small difference here is that you

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.740
have a gap now because we've carved off

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.270
this piece. So there's a little bit of

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.040
wiggle room here at the beginning.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.300
You can push it in several

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.719
different ways. There is no unique path

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:31.659
to push it. But anyway, if you push it you

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.129
see that it works just the same as

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:34.779
before. By the way, this was found by a

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:36.939
guy named Gerver, Joseph Gerver,

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.800
a mathematician from Rutgers University.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.360
The area of his sofa is 2.2195 roughly

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.520
so about half a percent bigger than

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.249
Hammersley sofa. A very small improvement

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:50.050
but like I said, mathematically it's a

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.120
lot more interesting because the way he

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.639
derived it was sort of by thinking more

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.770
carefully about what it would mean for

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.660
a sofa to have the largest area.

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.620
It's not just an arbitrary construction,

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.220
it's something that that was carefully

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:03.879
thought out and, you know, leads to some

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.349
very interesting equations that he

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.349
solved and he conjectured that this

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.120
sofa is the optimal one - the one that has

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.639
the largest area and that is still not

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:15.009
proved or disproved. So that's that's the

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:16.020
open problem here.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.140
[Brady] Did he conjecture

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.199
based on anything of rigor or was it

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.300
just he came up with so he's affected

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.800
he's fond of his desire.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.180
[Prof. Romik] Um, well it could be

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.180
that he's fond of his design I have no

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.480
doubt. Um, nobody has some real some pretty

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:31.870
good reasons to conjecture that it's

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.750
optimal because, like i said, the way it

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.270
was derived is by thinking what would it

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:38.710
mean for sofas to be optimal,

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.240
in particular it would have to be locally

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.000
optimal, meaning you can't make a small

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.399
perturbation to the shape, like near some

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:47.439
specific set of points, that would

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:49.599
increase the area. So, i mean, that's a

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.430
typical approach in calculus when you're

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.710
trying to maximize the function then to

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.509
find a max--the global maximum, you often

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.069
start by looking for the local maximum

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.930
right? So that's kind of the reasoning

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.490
that guided him. You could say that the

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.550
sofa satisfies a condition that is a

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.729
necessary condition to be optimal, so,

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:08.439
and it's the only sofa that has been

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.149
found that satisfied to this necessary

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:11.529
condition so that's pretty good

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:13.599
indication that it might be optimal.

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.580
I mean, of course, you know our imagination

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:17.979
is limited. Maybe we just haven't been

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:19.509
clever enough and haven't been able to

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.639
find something that works better, but

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.240
that's the best we can do.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.340
So recently I am, myself, became interested in this

00:06:26.349 --> 00:06:28.750
problem, more as a hobby then a some

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.520
kind of official research project I

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.129
start tinkering with it and trying to

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:35.139
wrap my head around some of the math that

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.900
goes into it, which is surprisingly tricky

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.760
but interestingly I was able to find

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.220
some new advances in sofa technology,

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.960
you could say. I did several things. The first

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.030
thing I tried to do is to get a good

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.710
understanding what Gerver had done.

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.560
Because it really wasn't obvious, I mean

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.200
i was reading his paper and it's kind of

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.360
pretty technical and dense. What can I do

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:57.910
next, I mean how can I improve on what

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.520
he had done, and of course, two obvious

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.770
choices would be to try to find a better

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.440
sofa than he did or to try to prove that

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.170
you cannot find a better sofa and sadly I

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.720
was unable to do either of those things

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:14.100
so that was a bit discouraging. But then,

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.360
I had an interesting idea to do

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.410
something that is essentially a

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.480
variation of what he had done. If we go

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.130
back to this thing with the the house

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.380
with the two corridors, right? Now imagine

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.730
that your house has a slightly more

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:27.460
complicated structure to it what if it

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.950
looks like this? So you have a corridor

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.840
and then a turn and then another corridor

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:32.980
and then another turn and another

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.870
corridor. Let's see what happens when we

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:37.150
try to put I mean even the simplest one

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.100
of these sofas through this corridor

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.940
right so we push it on through here we

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.820
rotate it to push it on through here and

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:49.750
now we get stuck because this is the

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.250
sofa that can only rotate to the right.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.460
Now of course, when you have it in your

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:55.690
room and you were sitting on it, that's

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.720
not really, it doesn't bother you. But for

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.430
the purpose of transporting it, that can

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.130
be a nuisance, right? So then I ask myself

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:08.140
the question that is the natural variant

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.410
or generalization of the original

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.210
problem and actually turned out of this

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.590
was a version of the problem that had

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.120
been thought about by other people as

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.530
well and I refer to it as the

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.840
ambidextrous moving sofa problem so this

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.330
is to consider all sofa shapes that

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:24.760
can move around this corridor meaning so

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.070
they can turn in both directions and out

00:08:27.070 --> 00:08:29.020
of that class of sofas to find the one

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.220
that has the largest area.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:33.160
So you're looking for the optimal ambi-turner?

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.979
Have you seen the film Zoolander?

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.580
[Ben Stiller as Derek Zoolander]: I'm not an ambi-turner.

00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:42.340
it's a problem I've had since i was a baby. Can't turn left.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.720
well then I ended up finding actually a new shape that that

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:47.640
satisfies this condition of being able

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.570
to turn in both directions it no longer

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:51.670
looks very much like a realistic sofa

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:53.800
but mathematically of course it's a well

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.080
defined shape it's perfectly good okay

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.890
so you push it you rotate it while

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.200
pushing it and it works and of course

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.000
it's going to work equally well in the

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.530
other direction because it's symmetric

00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:08.080
so it doesn't distinguish left from right

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.860
[Owen Wilson as Hansel]: There it is!

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.480
[Jon Voight as Larry Zoolander]: Holy Moley

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.980
[Will Ferrell as Mugatu]: It's beautiful!

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:17.760
[ Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries]: Derek you did it! That was amazing!

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.480
[Derek]: I know I turned left!

00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.260
[Prof. Romik]: It's quite subtle, in fact it's subtle in many of the same

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.900
ways the Gerver sofa is subtle so if you

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.860
remember I told you that to describe

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.770
Gerver's sofa you need 18 different

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:31.810
curves I mean there's three of them are--

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:33.400
that are just straight line segments

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.520
but the other 15 are just--are curved and

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.820
in a few of them are circular arcs so

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.440
that's not very complicated but the

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.510
other ones are really pretty--pretty

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.820
complicated to describe the curve you

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.290
can write down formulas for them and

00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.360
everything except there's some numerical

00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.770
constants that are involved that you

00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.779
can't write formulas for because they're

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.910
sort of we are obtained numerically by

00:09:54.910 --> 00:09:57.700
solving certain equations now with the

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.800
new sofa that I discovered and I did

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.420
that by applying the same idea that

00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.400
Gerver had developed and that I sort of

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.130
developed slightly further was led to in

00:10:06.130 --> 00:10:07.720
certain system of equations that I had

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.060
to solve and I solved it and that's

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.620
where the shape comes from and again it

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.779
turns out the shape is made of 18

00:10:13.779 --> 00:10:16.060
different curves that you need to glue

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:19.060
together in a very precise way so yes it

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.860
is definitely quite elaborate it's not

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.140
like it's not a circle it's not a square

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.840
it's something new.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.820
[Brady]: it seems to have like, pointy ends,
the ends seem pointed

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.540
[Prof Romik]: the ends are pointed yes they made a certain

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:33.339
angle and that angle is an interesting

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.960
numerical constant that also shows up in the analysis.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.520
[Brady]: what's the angle?

00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.680
[Prof Romik]: something like sixteen point six degrees and--but

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.510
more interestingly it has the precise

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:45.190
formula that i can write down for you

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.860
and this is another big surprise that I

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.589
had when I found this with--like I said

00:10:50.589 --> 00:10:52.779
with Gerver's sofa, it--you can

00:10:52.779 --> 00:10:54.310
describe it, i mean there's a full

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:57.339
description of what Gerver's sofa is but

00:10:57.339 --> 00:10:59.920
in math we like to distinguish between

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.540
things that can be written in closed

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:03.459
form and things that can't be written in

00:11:03.459 --> 00:11:05.740
closed form so a number like square root

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.750
of two is a number that you can write in

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:09.580
closed form right? of course that's just

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:11.410
shorthand for saying it solves the

00:11:11.410 --> 00:11:13.900
equation x squared equals two but there

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.779
are numbers that come from solving like

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:18.700
a system of maybe two or three equations

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.190
and there isn't a simple way to say this

00:11:21.190 --> 00:11:24.819
number is the arc cosine of

00:11:24.819 --> 00:11:27.459
thing or it's pi over 18 or something

00:11:27.459 --> 00:11:29.949
like that so it's not easily expressible

00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:32.019
in terms of known constants and that's

00:11:32.019 --> 00:11:33.910
the feature that Gerver's sofa has is that

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.609
to describe it properly you need to put

00:11:36.609 --> 00:11:39.069
in certain numerical constants that-- that

00:11:39.069 --> 00:11:41.199
cannot be written in closed form, whereas

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.959
when I found my new shape I discovered

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.700
that it can be written in closed form. in

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.649
fact all the equations that describe it

00:11:47.649 --> 00:11:50.799
are algebraic equations, not--not something

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:52.809
I was expecting at all and makes

00:11:52.809 --> 00:11:54.400
everything in some sense nicer.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:57.720
[Brady]: as Gerver's sofa is thought possibly to be the

00:11:57.729 --> 00:12:00.279
optimal solution is your optimal

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:02.829
solution here for the ambi-turner--
[Prof Romik]: yes

00:12:02.829 --> 00:12:05.229
[Brady]: proven to be optimal or you don't know

00:12:05.229 --> 00:12:06.759
[Prof Romik]: no I don't know it so the state of

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.350
affairs is precisely the same as with

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.499
the original problem namely that nothing

00:12:11.499 --> 00:12:13.869
is proved about what shape is optimal

00:12:13.869 --> 00:12:16.059
but I derive the shape that is a good

00:12:16.059 --> 00:12:18.519
candidate to be the optimal I mean I'm

00:12:18.519 --> 00:12:20.859
not going on record as you saying this

00:12:20.859 --> 00:12:23.439
is a conjecture of mine because I don't

00:12:23.439 --> 00:12:25.299
feel confident enough to make such a

00:12:25.299 --> 00:12:27.850
conjecture but certainly it would be a

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.279
very plausible candidate and if somebody

00:12:30.279 --> 00:12:31.689
were to come and show that it was optimal

00:12:31.689 --> 00:12:32.829
that wouldn't surprise me in the least

00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:35.559
and if they show it wasn't optimal and

00:12:35.559 --> 00:12:38.319
that would surprise me a little bit okay

00:12:38.319 --> 00:12:39.609
that's that's a good question because

00:12:39.609 --> 00:12:42.129
there's a bit of a story there so what

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:43.959
happened was that I was playing with

00:12:43.959 --> 00:12:46.269
this problem for several months actually

00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:48.579
as a little bit of the hobby that

00:12:48.579 --> 00:12:51.249
something served not to do with with my

00:12:51.249 --> 00:12:53.619
normal research and had more to do with

00:12:53.619 --> 00:12:56.850
my hobby of 3D printing.
