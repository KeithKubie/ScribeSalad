what happened I said what we had a

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220
what happened I said what we had a
 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.920
what happened I said what we had a
brainstorm and I said well what's the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930
brainstorm and I said well what's the
 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.149

result they said well I had a lot of
 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.100
result they said well I had a lot of
ideas and we're you know what are you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110
ideas and we're you know what are you
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.259
ideas and we're you know what are you
gonna do with it and they haven't really

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269
gonna do with it and they haven't really
 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.479
gonna do with it and they haven't really
made it actionable so here's the thing

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
made it actionable so here's the thing
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.030

good jazz team it can really you know
 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.420
good jazz team it can really you know
play off of each other but you know at

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430
play off of each other but you know at
 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.670

it at the d.school there'll be 150 you

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649
it at the d.school there'll be 150 you
 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.859

know post-its on the board but but

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
know post-its on the board but but
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810
know post-its on the board but but
that's not the end because you haven't

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820
that's not the end because you haven't
 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.539
that's not the end because you haven't
really done anything generating the

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
really done anything generating the
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.639

ideas is relatively simple once you get

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649
ideas is relatively simple once you get
 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:28.160
ideas is relatively simple once you get
good at it figuring out what you're

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170
good at it figuring out what you're
 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719
good at it figuring out what you're
gonna do with the idea is putting them

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729
gonna do with the idea is putting them
 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.870
gonna do with the idea is putting them
into sort of buckets often ideas are

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880
into sort of buckets often ideas are
 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.999
into sort of buckets often ideas are
clustered around certain themes so the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
clustered around certain themes so the
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.830
clustered around certain themes so the
first thing we do and we the reason we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
first thing we do and we the reason we
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.300
first thing we do and we the reason we
use the post-its is then we stop you so

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310
use the post-its is then we stop you so
 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.459
use the post-its is then we stop you so
get the brain storms over we're gonna

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469
get the brain storms over we're gonna
 

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:41.719
get the brain storms over we're gonna
now we're gonna do a little bit of

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
now we're gonna do a little bit of
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.190
now we're gonna do a little bit of
evaluation a little bit of what we call

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200
evaluation a little bit of what we call
 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.810
evaluation a little bit of what we call
naming and framing the ideas we're and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820
naming and framing the ideas we're and
 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.029
naming and framing the ideas we're and
put them into the clike this cluster is

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039
put them into the clike this cluster is
 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:48.709
put them into the clike this cluster is
all around one thing this cluster is all

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719
all around one thing this cluster is all
 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:50.450
all around one thing this cluster is all
around another thing this is these are

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460
around another thing this is these are
 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.190
around another thing this is these are
all wild cars they don't cluster at all

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
all wild cars they don't cluster at all
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.279
all wild cars they don't cluster at all
which kind of move the post-its around

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289
which kind of move the post-its around
 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.349
which kind of move the post-its around
and then we try to give them we try to

00:01:57.349 --> 00:01:57.359
and then we try to give them we try to
 

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:59.840
and then we try to give them we try to
you know put the buckets or sub buckets

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850
you know put the buckets or sub buckets
 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.879
you know put the buckets or sub buckets
into some kind of a framework and we

00:02:01.879 --> 00:02:01.889
into some kind of a framework and we
 

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:03.709
into some kind of a framework and we
just give it a name and the funny or the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719
just give it a name and the funny or the
 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.139
just give it a name and the funny or the
name of the better these are the crazy

grandmother ideas these are the ideas

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
grandmother ideas these are the ideas
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.300
grandmother ideas these are the ideas
you know if if you know if ducks could

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310
you know if if you know if ducks could
 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.670
you know if if you know if ducks could
you know fly or if chickens could fly

you know fly or if chickens could fly
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.289
you know fly or if chickens could fly
this is what the ideas would be so we

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299
this is what the ideas would be so we
 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.300
this is what the ideas would be so we
give them funny names but it's it the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310
give them funny names but it's it the
 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.630
give them funny names but it's it the
idea

to sort of bring them back down into

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
to sort of bring them back down into
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.870
to sort of bring them back down into
reality and put them into some kind of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880
reality and put them into some kind of
 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.390
reality and put them into some kind of
framework because at the end of my

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
framework because at the end of my
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.860

happened they say we had 150 ideas

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940
happened they say we had 150 ideas
 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.430
happened they say we had 150 ideas
turns out they were in about six

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440
turns out they were in about six
 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.890
turns out they were in about six
different categories and we when then we

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900
different categories and we when then we
 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.660
different categories and we when then we
rank the top ideas in each category and

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670
rank the top ideas in each category and
 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.420
rank the top ideas in each category and
we have seven ideas we would really like

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.910
got these ideas now you brainstorm all
the different ways just you could create

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920
the different ways just you could create
 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.340
the different ways just you could create
a prototype around those ideas and then

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350
a prototype around those ideas and then
 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.460
a prototype around those ideas and then
you name those bring them back out of

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470
you name those bring them back out of
 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:11.990

crazy land into something that's
 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.229
crazy land into something that's
actually real and then you have

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239
actually real and then you have
 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.460
actually real and then you have
something that you can work with so at

that's an actionable brainstorm and and
then you do the prototypes and you get

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
then you do the prototypes and you get
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:31.910
then you do the prototypes and you get
some new data and the world tells you

you get to brainstorm again but bringing

and it'll trickle out that's been one of
 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.100
and it'll trickle out that's been one of
the most successful innovations right in

the most successful innovations right in

it's things like that where you really
 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.800
it's things like that where you really
need a brand new idea that requires the

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810
need a brand new idea that requires the
 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.619
need a brand new idea that requires the
wild idea to get it started and then you

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629
wild idea to get it started and then you
 

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:04.999
wild idea to get it started and then you
can always bring it back and find ways

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:05.009
can always bring it back and find ways
 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:07.879
can always bring it back and find ways
to make it implementable
