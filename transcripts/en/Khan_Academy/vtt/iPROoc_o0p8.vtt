00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.900
- [Sal] We've already talked quite a bit

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.450
about the idea that if, look,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.450
if you have a market,
capitalist economy, that some,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.900
that this will lead,
hopefully, to economic growth,

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.870
economic growth, but by definition,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.850
a market economy will have
some folks who win more

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.450
and some folks who don't do as well,

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.000
and it's going to, you're
also going to have inequality.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.450
Inequality; so inequality is
essentially a fact of life

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.960
of a market economy,
and it's not necessarily

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.400
something that you just wanna turn off,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.440
because that might also
hurt economic growth,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.610
and that actually might
make everyone better off

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.620
because the economic growth
on a per capita basis

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.780
could also be benefiting people

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.800
who aren't in the top percentile
or decile or quartile.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
Not always, but it could be.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.490
But with that thought
in the back of our mind,

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.210
let's actually think a little bit more

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.130
about inequality and how it's measured,

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.230
and how it can be tied
to things like capital

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.540
and growth of income to
capital and returns on capital.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.290
So this right over here, this
is from Thomas Piketty's book,

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.290
and what's neat is he's
made all of the charts

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.460
of his book available
online, right over there,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.900
and this shows income
inequality in the United States

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.730
between 1910 and 2010,
and what you see here,

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.200
he measures it by the share of top decile

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.890
in national income.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.170
So top decile's the top 10%,
so this point right over here

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.270
tells us that in 1910,
the top 10% of earners

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.150
made a little over 40%
of the national income.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.170
As we go into the late
20s, that approaches 50%

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.820
of the top, the top 10% of earners

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.590
were making close to half
of the national income.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.570
And then as we go through
the Great Depression,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.380
and especially after World War II,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.390
this drops down into the low 30%s,

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.030
and then from the 1980s to the present,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.450
this has crept back up
to the high 40% range.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.980
So the top decile, the top 10% of earners,

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.537
are making close to half
of the national income.

00:02:05.537 --> 00:02:09.500
Now let's just visualize how
this happens, just numerically.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.473
So let's imagine this is
your economy in year one.

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.030
So this is your economy in year one.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.470
Actually, let me copy and paste that.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.540
I think that'll be useful.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.220
So copy, all right.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.650
And let's say that this is the fraction,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.140
I'll do it in orange, that
is going to the top decile.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.820
So let's say it's roughly
a third in year one.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.220
So this is the fraction that's
going to the top decile.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.260
This is 1/3 right over here.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.110
So the way that you have rising,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.200
so on this chart, this
would be kind of a 33.3,

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.150
so it would be someplace around here,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.010
so we could pretend like we're some date

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.000
in the 60s or 70s right over here,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
and now the way that you
have this chart moving up,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.160
where you have the top decile

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.560
having a larger and larger
share of national income,

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.260
is if this orange section grows faster

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.020
than this green section.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.020
So for example, this grew by 10%

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.463
while this grew by 5%,

00:03:17.331 --> 00:03:20.560
by 5%, over time this orange section

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.750
is going to take a larger and larger chunk

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.740
of the green section.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.030
Now as we saw in previous videos,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.500
even if this does happen,
and this is by definition

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.300
rising inequality, there
could be a scenario

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.970
where the other 90% are
still having a bigger pie,

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.800
and on a per capita
basis still might be able

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:41.390
to be better off.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.790
But the focus of this video is not that.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.430
The focus of the video is tying this idea

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.520
to the idea of increasing
returns on capital

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.170
driving this phenomenon,
driving inequality,

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.150
income inequality.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.710
So as we've seen before, income and wealth

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.440
are not the same thing, but
wealth could be a proxy.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.790
The more wealth that
you have, you will have

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.400
more income from that wealth.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.710
You will have return on that capital.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.360
So another way to divide the economy

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.710
is instead of thinking
of the top 10% of earners

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.350
and the other 90% of
earners, you could think of

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.670
how much of this income goes
to the owners of capital,

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.510
and how much of it goes to the
people who provide the labor?

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.610
So it's more of a labor-capital split

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.950
versus the bottom 90%-top 10% split.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.400
So here we could think of
this section right over here,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.940
and I'll just make it a different,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.610
so let's say this is right over here,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.620
this is how much is going
to owners of capital,

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.760
to capital, to owners of capital,

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.860
the people who own the
buildings, the real estate,

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.450
the resources, and how
much of national income

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:57.540
is going to labor.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.070
So this right over here,
this right over here

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.700
is going to labor.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.754
Now the same, a similar idea is, look,

00:05:08.754 --> 00:05:13.110
if this blue section grows,

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.063
consistently grows faster
than the green pie,

00:05:18.666 --> 00:05:20.860
then the percentage of
income that goes to capital

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.550
is going to grow more and more and more,

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:25.990
and because in capitalist market economies

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.820
capital is also not evenly distributed,

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.740
mainly because income is
not evenly distributed,

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.400
because capital is not evenly distributed,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.496
that this would essentially lead.

00:05:36.496 --> 00:05:39.270
As more and more income goes to capital

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.024
and that capital is
disproportionately owned

00:05:41.024 --> 00:05:44.790
by the upper decile of income or wealth,

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.490
then you're going to,
it's essentially going

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.540
to drive this phenomenon right over there.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.730
Now I wanna be very clear.

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.730
This growth right over
here, you'll hear the term

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.340
return on capital in
conjunction with Piketty's book

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.990
where they compare the return
on capital to growth rates.

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:05.060
This growth right over here
is not the return on capital.

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:06.920
In order to know the return on capital,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.050
you have to know how much,
you need to know the income

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.710
that the capital generated,
but you also have to know

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.931
the value of that capital,
and here in this diagram,

00:06:13.931 --> 00:06:16.760
all I know is the income
that the capital generated,

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.820
but I don't know the
value of that capital,

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.960
so I can't calculate
the return on capital.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.890
This growth that I'm
showing right over here,

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.660
maybe after a few years
this blue section grows

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.300
to over here, while the green section,

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.500
while the pie has grown
something like this,

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:32.910
this growth right over here,

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.910
you could view this as the
growth of income to capital,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:40.800
which isn't something
you hear a lot about.

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.780
But this growth right over here,

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.780
this growth, maybe this is
plus 5% for the total economy,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.470
this is the G that's often referred to.

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:54.193
This is the total growth of the economy.
