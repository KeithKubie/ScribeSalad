00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.880
Even when a movie is original, it isn’t
an entirely new idea per say.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.850
By now, just about every story has been told
and the works of yesteryear inspire the ones

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.850
of today.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.000
It isn’t out of the question for some movies
to bear similarities to others, but there

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.930
are times when Hollywood really scratches
the bottom of the barrel.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.570
There are numerous instances of studios releasing
“twin” films, which are projects with

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.860
nearly identical setups that come out just
months apart from each other.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.510
It happens more often than you’d think.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.820
Here are 10 twin movies suspiciously released
at the same time.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.030
Jobs and Steve Jobs

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.150
With both based on the life of tech icon Steve
Jobs, there were obvious parallels between

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.760
Jobs and Steve Jobs.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.510
The proximity of their release dates was the
stranger fact.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.680
Following Jobs’ death in 2011, there was
a race to get a biopic off the ground.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
The Ashton Kutcher starring Jobs was the first
in theaters, but was a critical dud.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.581
Two years later, Michael Fassbender teamed
up with Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for a

00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:01.580
different take – one that was far better
received, yet bombed at the box office.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.180
Fassbender was nominated for an Oscar, but
neither left much of an impact when it was

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.860
all said and done.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.250
No Strings Attached and Friends With Benefits

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.740
Even the most devout cinephile can’t keep
these two straight.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.340
Released in 2011, No Strings Attached and
Friends With Benefits both featured a couple

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.500
of attractive people agreeing to engage in
a casual sex-based relationship, only to fall

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.580
in love later on.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.520
They were even both called Friends With Benefits
when they started production.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.940
To avoid a further mix-up, Paramount changed
the name of their project, and both ended

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:30.800
up becoming hits at the box office.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.680
They may not have reinvented the rom-com wheel,
but there are worse ways to spend a date night.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.600
This is the End and The World’s End

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.700
Friends Simon Pegg and Seth Rogen discovered
through conversation that they were coincidentally

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.290
working on similar apocalyptic films about
a group of friends trying to survive a catastrophic

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.290
event.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.340
The main difference between the two was that
in Rogen’s This is the End, the actors are

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.170
playing fictionalized versions of themselves,
whereas The World’s End is a more traditional

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.050
narrative film with the cast portraying original
characters.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.140
Fortunately for moviegoers, they both served
up plenty of laughs and thrills, earning excellent

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.930
reviews and posting high figures at the box
office.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.100
We guess audiences just love watching the
world explode.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.679
It’s a premise that never gets old.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.510
Mission to Mars and Red Planet

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.100
Any sci-fi fan has dreamed about traveling
to Mars, and it’s long been a staple of

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.450
Hollywood films – well before The Martian
was nominated for Oscars.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.830
In 2000, Disney released Mission to Mars,
a film that was based on a Tomorrowland ride

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.790
that had closed in the 1990s.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.401
It proved to be somewhat successful, which
is more than we can say for Red Planet, which

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:31.280
was also about a trip to Mars.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.890
That movie bombed so poorly, director Antony
Hoffman never worked on a big time feature

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.890
again.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.300
Neither performed all that well with critics
though, so it’s hard to call Disney the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.190
out and out winner here.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.980
Megamind and Despeciable Me

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.200
Even by 2010, we had already had several superhero
movies.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.110
What about on focusing on a villain?

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.630
Hollywood determined the time was right for
two such projects as this decade began – releasing

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.540
Megamind and Despicable Me.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.710
Both were about evildoers with a heart of
gold who redeem themselves by stopping a larger,

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:58.710
greater threat.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.310
Since Megamind came out after Despicable Me,
it was criticized for copying off of the formula

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.120
– even though the two were probably in production
at the same time.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.610
What gave Despicable Me the edge were the
Minions, who are now just as popular on their

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.070
own as the film series.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.710
There’s still no Megamind 2.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.230
Observe and Report and Paul Blart: Mall Cop

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.390
Who knew mall security could be so funny?

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.180
Comedies Observe and Report and Paul Blart:
Mall Cop looked to give these underappreciated

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.800
law enforcers the spotlight in 2009, with
Seth Rogen and Kevin James out to prove that

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.200
mall policemen were more than just a punchline.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.230
There seemed to be room for both, since they
were going after very different audiences.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.060
Observe and Report was a classic, R-rated
Rogen vehicle, while Paul Blart aimed more

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.040
for family laughs with a PG rating.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.819
While neither was a critical darling, Paul
Blart was the overwhelming victor at the box

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.650
office, making enough to earn a sequel.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.129
Chasing Liberty and First Daughter

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:49.610
Political movies can always be interesting
– especially in an election year.

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.540
As US citizens geared up for the 2004 presidential
race, Hollywood was asking moviegoers to decide

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.620
which film about the president’s daughter
was better: Chasing Liberty or First Daughter.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:02.140
Both were bland rom-coms with the president’s
daughter as the protagonist, trying to shed

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.560
the life of luxury living in the White House
for a more “normal” existence.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.680
Neither film worked all that well, despite
some intriguing talent attached, leading to

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
both bombing at the box office.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.750
Maybe tales of the First Family aren’t as
fascinating as the one who’s actually in

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:15.750
charge?

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:16.750
Gordy and Babe

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.470
There was a boom in talking pig films in the
mid-1990s.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.310
Gordy and Babe were both released just months
apart from each other.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.470
The former was about a pig trying to find
his family after they were taken away to be

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:26.470
slaughtered.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.569
Though it reached theaters first, it was no
match for Babe, which was one of the five

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.210
Best Picture nominees of that year.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.270
It even won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects,
breaking new ground in talking animal pictures.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.249
Making it even more incredible is that it’s
from the mind of Mad Max creator George Miller,

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.580
so he showed impressive range with this film.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.229
The Equalizer and John Wick

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:53.050
2014 saw two throwback action vehicles find
success critically and at the box office.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.969
Starring Denzel Washington and Keanu Reeves,
the Equalizer and John Wick revolve around

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:01.240
ex-hitmen who come out of retirement to settle
a personal vendetta against the Russian mob.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.939
The motivations were different, but the comparisons
were obvious.

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:08.589
In a weird coincidence, the sequels to both
are scheduled for release in 2017, so these

00:05:08.589 --> 00:05:11.370
two blossoming franchises are going to duel
again next year.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.210
If it’s anything like the first round, fans
won’t be complaining and thoroughly enjoy

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:15.210
the ride.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.289
It’s hard to go wrong with either of these
actors in a leading role.

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:20.289
Batman V Superman and Captain America: Civil
War

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:25.339
After years of superhero films being fun escapism
for fans, 2016 decided to double down on the

00:05:25.339 --> 00:05:28.819
guilt and emotional toll metahumans face on
a daily basis.

00:05:28.819 --> 00:05:33.780
Launching the new DCEU, Batman V Superman
pitted the two iconic heroes together in a

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:37.639
philosophical battle to determine which brand
of justice was more appropriate.

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.249
Months later, Marvel released Captain America:
Civil War, which saw the Avengers split into

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:44.949
two factions and debate over the subject of
superhero accountability.

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:49.270
Both had very different critical and box office
performances, but they tackled similar, thought-provoking

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.689
concepts to deconstruct their genres.

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.930
It was interesting, but we’re looking forward
to the fun again.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.560
Those are our picks for twin movies released
at the same time.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.860
Are there any we missed?

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:59.990
Which ones do you prefer?
