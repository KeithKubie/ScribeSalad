Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and it's time for the Thursday afternoon. Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast. And

Speaker 2:          00:00:09       ahhh

Speaker 1:          00:00:11       just checking in on you. Just checking in on you. I'm actually recording this one's day before the game. Seven Jeff fucking with Ya. It's Thursday. I watched the game. I know what happened. All right. I got to say congratulations to the Saint Louis Blues on your first Stanley Cup Championship. Ever avenge Jake, your mother's Day's loss was it May 13th, 1970 something like that. 40 fucking nine years later. Um, I'm not gonna lie to you. I had a smile on my face when I was watching all those St Louis Blues fans going crazy. And one of my favorite things in the world is watching, uh, a franchise that hasn't won it in forever when it, but I feel like I got fucked over because they beat my team, so I couldn't fully enjoy it the same way. Like I, you know, I was rooting for the eagles, you know, to win a Superbowl. I just didn't want him to beat the Patriots.

Speaker 1:          00:01:07       So both of those, you know, I felt like I would've enjoyed way more, obviously if they weren't beating my team. But like Jesus Christ, hats off to the Saint Louis Blues Organizations, they played a fucking masterful game seven. It was such a great series where it was really just the speed of the Bruins versus this physical, we'll have the blues, what was going to win. And I got to say, oh, freckles kind of called it, did he not, did he not? I said, the way to beat the blues is you got a score first and pull him out of that fucking trap defense that they were playing, Eh, which would open up the ice for our speed. And that's what happened in game like game three in game six. Um, and when they went up one to nothing, and I was like, fuck, we need, we need to get this next goal.

Speaker 1:          00:01:59       We need to get this next goal. We can't have them. We can't have them up to, oh, I mean I haven't seen the trap defense played that well since the boring ass New Jersey devils one, three cups. Some of the worst hockey I've ever seen in my life as far as excitement went. But what I loved about the way the blues played it was as much as I was kind of being a fucking cunt about it, I actually in the end really enjoyed the way they played. Um, playing outside the lines a little bit, but that is playoff hockey. And you know, I lose looking up some hockey stats before game seven. The Bruins back in the day when the Canadians would always be this, you know, Don Cherry was our coach and it's something I read was just, he told him to have their sticks up high around Gila floor and we still didn't beat and Mckela Flora's whole fucking head was swollen and cut up by the end of this series.

Speaker 1:          00:02:49       So we've done shit like that. So I would be a real fucking pansy here if I was to complain about some of the rougher stuff. And just the bottom line was we, um, I set it, dude. I said, it said you don't want to go seven games with this team because you're going to be to beat up by the end. You know, if you're the finesse team, you gotta he gotta win it and five or six or they're just going to weigh you down. The way I saw him were down in San Jose, which is exactly what they did. And uh, I was too hard on Billington. I said he was astoundingly mediocre. I was as hard on him is they have been overly complimenting him. All right? First Rookie goaltenders I have a good 68 games. It's like Patrick while only one 15 and 1986 because you could only win 15.

Speaker 1:          00:03:36       All right. The first round was best three out of five. So it's not his fault that he couldn't have beat their ass and other fucking game. Um, not to mention he won the cons. My thing had a 1.92 goals against average. My thing about Billington was this and he had four fucking stand on your head saves in a game seven so you can never take that away from that guy. But that guy was definitely a different goal tender when he was down. Okay. When we win game six, when we were actually fucking got a little physical and we went up, you know, we, we, we went up a goal, you know, the same thing. We didn't gain three. All of a sudden the guy's given up five goals that game and getting pulled out of one game. So last night what I was watching, the problem that we were having, and I've never seen a team for check as well as the blue, uh, and in recent memory is the St Louis Blues.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       What they kept talking about their goaltender it, I don't know what the fucking game they were watching, what the game was between the goaltenders and like, have you ever seen a fucking team? Like they stop like every fucking past we made. There was like every time a Bruin had a puck there was like a, there was like a clock thousand 1000 to get rid of it, get rid of it or they would just going to come up and just physically take it away from you. We had the amount of passes that we would like through the air, like saucer pass try to do and they would just bat it down out of the air. Like they had like a fucking, I dunno, like they had a goaltender's stick. It was unbelievable how fucking amazing they were at that. I'm not good with the names cause I got a kid now and I got to watch the game with the fucking sound out.

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       But that number nine on the blues, I can't remember what your first or second goal and we, I think crazy. Somebody had the puck and he just knocked him down, kept in in our zone and I was like, and then you know, they're passionate, they're passing that keeping it in the zone the whole time ago. If they score here, then that number nine should get a fucking assist. And sure enough they ended up scoring I think on the tip shot or I can't remember. It was so sort of the partial breakaway backhander that guy got by Tuco. Um, but the big thing was to beat them. You had to go up cause when you went up then Billington came back down to earth and the problem last night as we got down and we got down early and then he got to stay behind the cushy confines of the way they were playing that trap defense and we did not have a power forward was what was lacking on our team.

Speaker 1:          00:06:02       We needed a guy in the slot taken the punishment and we were to beat up and just didn't have that fucking guy. So what was happening is when we got into their offensive zone, if you want, we watched the game the amount of times we had the puck in a good position and we would pass all the way to the other side of the ice, go wing to wing and an NHL goaltender. That's all day to go from post to post. And we just didn't get any traffic in front. And too many of our shots from, we're from out near the Blue Line where he had a wide open look. I mean, by the time we finally got traffic out in front and scored on him, it took us six on five. We had to have an extra guy so somebody could stand out in front. And, um, I dunno, I love the blues aggressive style, the way that they played and um, and they knocked us on our ass and we have to get bigger and stronger.

Speaker 1:          00:06:51       Congratulations that Bruins. They went way further this year than I thought they were going to. Um, you know, we definitely got it. You know, we got rid of too many like Sean Thorton's and Luke chichis and Adam McQuaids where we couldn't hit him back. And that was really, really hard to watch as a Bruins fan because I've never seen us get physically dominated like that. Um, but, uh, I dunno. I Dunno. I Dunno. It kinda ended up going the way I thought I was going to go. And I was honest the other day when I said I had absolutely no feeling on which way it was going to go in game seven, which I don't know how you could, because if you watch the Bruins and game won a game three and games six, you would think that the blues couldn't play with us. And then if you watch the Bruins end game fucking two, four, five and seven, you would've thought we would've got swept.

Speaker 1:          00:07:49       It was such a fucking weird series where it was, it was almost like just whoever got out front first like that was it and the game was going to be played the way they played it. You know, if, if the Bruins got out front, it was going to be a speed game and we were going to win in Billington was going to let up four or five fucking goals or they got out front and, and fucking, it was just going to be this physical game and we were, we were going to play 80% of the game in our, in our own fucking end. But, um, I don't know. I'll tell you this though. That's going to be a hell of a party on, on uh, on Saturday down there in St Louis. You guys totally deserve it. We're really, at the end of the day, we're the better team. I'm being a little cunty with your goaltender and it has nothing that, this isn't a personal attack on the guy.

Speaker 1:          00:08:35       I'm just so fucking sick of like sports casters in sports networks, the way they spew out stats with no sort of historical perspective is the same way a politician, you know, we'll fudge numbers and shit to make this guy doesn't like babies. You know, he voted no on this fucking thing and they don't look at what's attached to the fucking bill as to why this person voted no. Like this fucking horse shit where it's just like this guy just had more wins than Ken Dryden. It's like we can drive and play and I think you needed, he needed eight. There was only two rounds of the playoffs or you'd be watching like major league baseball and be like, I'll tell her, here's a stat that just came in so and so just pass babe Ruth the salt. And the Swat for most postseason play offs. It's like there, they're back in Babe Ruth played.

Speaker 1:          00:09:29       It was like whoever had the most wins in the American league that was winning the pennant. There was no play off. You just immediately went to the world series. So the best you could do is play seven games in a year. So now you could play, what is it? The first round is the best of five. You can play five and another four. You play 19 fucking games in one year now, so obviously you're going to start passing these guys sit down and say, hey, you know what I mean? He's who's getting, oh, I'm April. There's a reason why we're all sitting there, right? Oh, hey, this kid right now, he's got, I bet he's pinching himself, seen his name up, playing against eight fucker guard to attack attack. It's just, I don't understand that. It's just like, well, obviously if somebody is going to play three times as many games potentially every fucking year of their career, they're going to start passing some fucking amazing people.

Speaker 1:          00:10:20       You know, like Martin brought dirt. My main memory of this hall of fame, great goaltender was him stopping, dumping chase passes behind his fucking net. You don't have, the best I saw was Patrick Wa. That's the best I ever fucking soft. So that's why being a bit of a cunt, being a bit of a con, it definitely fucking, um, you know, it was fucking hilarious. As I watched the game and a cigar bar, I was so fucking sad when I left. I forgot my credit card. I've got to go back and get that today. But, um, I, uh, I was in there. I'm in New York. Nobody gave a shit about the fucking game. I had to tell him to turn the game on. And when the blues scored the first time on the deflection, the insult to injury was, I was sitting there and somebody just goes, oh, did they just score? And then he's watched the replay. He goes, Ooh, a ricochet.

Speaker 1:          00:11:21       It's just like, oh my God. Oh, ricochet. Okay. Um, anyways, but, uh, and then the ones in New York fans realized that I was rooting for Boston. They started giving me shit and I fucking destroyed them. And then they all had to shut the fuck up because they got nothing. They got nothing. They got fucking 97 fucking t. What do, what are you going to chant that me kind of what 2008 with the fucking Boston Celtics, the fuck out of here. Um, so anyway, and then I ended up fucking leaving it. Natus a slice of pizza. Like did you see, I loved, uh, what's his face? Um, El Pres there from fucking barstool that video. He took him just eating all kinds of bed. That's what I did. I went and I got to say, I was watching the game with Bobby Kelly and then I went, he dropped me off when I'm staying here in New York and I, uh, went over and just got a slice a pizza from the better famous race in the area and I'm just sat there by myself, like that weird fucking feeling, you know, when you're that close and you fucking lose and then it's the double whammy of not only did you lose, but that's the end of hockey for the year, which by the way, thank you Canada for hockey.

Speaker 1:          00:12:38       Jesus Christ. I still maintain, it's a fucking, it's the best of the four sports. Um, I was just sitting there eating that fucking thing by myself. Gone at fuck. And now I got to do the podcast and I got to eat crow the next fucking day while was fucking me. But I'm over it. And um, all right. So now that I've been a bit of a cup of tea, a goaltender, which he really doesn't deserve. Uh, so 1967 I'm going off the top of my head, cause one of these mall where fucking we know things took over my computer. I have a brand new laptop and they'd already it watch out when they say you need the new flash, whatever your flash player needs to be updated. I clicked on that. So now I have to spend a fucking day this week at the fucking apple store figuring out how to get rid of this fucking thing.

Speaker 1:          00:13:27       Uh, may all you fucking hackers out there burn in hell. All you fucking at the fucking assholes who did this. It's like you can't go after bankers. You can't go after fucking real pray. You got to fucking get some dumb bald fucking redheaded contracts team. Just lost the Stanley Cup final. You've got to fucking take over my computer so he can make more money off of JC Penney. You fucking assholes. So anyways, sad sacks fans. So this morning I got to go downstairs into the laundry room of a where I'm staying here and um, to do my laundry here, right? So I go downstairs to go do it. You figure Thursday morning, there's not going to be anybody here, but actually most of the machines would taken up. And fortunately I got one. And um, so I ended up going downstairs, you know, after the Washington was done in this guy sitting there and he's fucking assholes who does his laundry like once a leap year, he's got all these bags of shit and he's like taken up all the machines and he starts going like a, yeah, I'm just still waiting for one more, like worried, like I'm going to take one.

Speaker 1:          00:14:25       I go, that one's mine. It's almost done. He's like, all right. And the is mine is done. He's like, you want this? You want this, like trying to get me to take the basket, you know, over. And it's just like buddy, relax, right? So I take my shit out and you know, the stuff, I'm going to just let dry him the apartment. I fold that. And then I put my socks and underwears into the dryer and then all of a sudden he comes around the corner with this load of wet laundry and goes, I'm just going to leave this here. Absolutely. I'm like, what? He goes, I'm just going to leave this here. I'm like, what the fuck is he talking about? Then I realized that was somebody else's laundry. I'm like, is that somebody else's laundry? He's like, yeah, I got to. Don't drag me into this.

Speaker 1:          00:15:02       He goes, what? I go, don't drag me into this. That's not my laundry. Don't ask for my, okay, look, I'm the salting of the fucking laundry room. Things like you have to say anything. I'm like, you guys are fucking selfish cunt. Right? So I walk out just one of those people you just want to get away from. So I go out and I pushed the button and I'm waiting for the fucking elevator. Right? And I look up, I realized I didn't push the button because I'm so still thinking about the fucking game and what we could have done, which is all futile at this point. And I hit the up button and all of a sudden he comes walking out. So now it's like I got a fucking, I got a write up with this asshole. So I'm like, well, you know what? I'm the first floor of apartments. So worst case scenario, he gets off on my floor. You know? You know what this fucking asshole does. You know what he does? You know what it does? It gets in the elevator and he pushes lobby.

Speaker 1:          00:16:00       You fucking Billy. He got on my elevator. Okay. Which is a thing. My elevator is a thing. If you get on it first, it's your fucking elevator and if somebody gets on after you and then fucking hits a floor before you're getting off, they interrupted your life twice and they should apologize when they get off. I do it. That's my, that's my elevator out of kit. Is there anything worse when you're in a tall fucking building? You come down and some fucking asshole on 18 hits it and he gets on and then fucking hit 17 it's like he couldn't take the stairs.

Speaker 3:          00:16:32       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:16:32       yeah. Know you wear your wing tips. We're going to get scuffed up. Would you turn the corner? Oh, Bill, what are you really mad at? Ah, my team lost. God dammit. Um, oh, I was going to say, this is off the top of my head. The expansion six, if I remember correctly, was the Philadelphia flyers. Pittsburgh penguins, the Minnesota North Stars, the St Louis Blues, the La Kings in the California golden seals. So the California golden seals then I think became the Oakland Seals in, somehow they ended up in Cleveland and became the Cleveland Barons. And then they folded, or maybe a few of them sort of combined with Minnesota north stars. I can't quite remember what happened to them. So they never won one. Let's see if I can do this top of my head right. The flyers won at first 74 and 75 then the next ones to win it.

Speaker 4:          00:17:37       We're,

Speaker 1:          00:17:39       well, let's see here. Would it be the Dallas Stop Minnesota then be the Dallas Stars in 1999? No, the Pittsburgh Penguins. They want flyers. The penguins, the Dallas Stars in [inaudible] 99, then the La kings and then the fucking uh, Saint Louis Blues when it last night. So it took 52 years, 53 seasons, um, for the expansion six, all of those great fucking teams, um, that added so much to hockey, doubled the league.

Speaker 5:          00:18:19       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:18:23       To finally had the last one win the Stanley Cup. Here's the weird thing about hockey, right? Let's say you had a 16 league and you were adding another six teams who are obviously going to be weak, right? Because there are new teams. Okay. How would you divide those up if you're going to make two conferences once you take three of the original in one, three of the new and three of the original six and the other in three hockey didn't do that. They kept all the original six in one division and put all the expansion six in another division. So the first round of the playoffs was basically the Stanley Cup final between the two fucking original six teams. And that's why I believe we swept the blues in 1970. Last time he played, they were like go fucking brand new franchise.

Speaker 5:          00:19:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:19:09       So anyway, is there anything else that I wanted to talk about as far as hockey? I can't, I literally cannot even go on my computer. And what's funny is I, I tried refreshing and clearing all my web browser history and I lost all my passwords. I can't even get into my fucking email. It's a fucking nightmare. Um, so now I'm going to go over and, you know, talk to one of the geniuses at the apple store to see if they can fucking figure out one of the evil geniuses who came up with this mall where horseshit. Um, I've now realized I'm not clicking on anything anymore. Okay. I'm done with this shit. I'm going to get a rotary phone. If you want to get in contact with me, just fucking call me. Maybe I'll be home. Maybe I won't be, I'm just going to go back to old school shit cause um, you know, I was telling you when, you know, I have these acting gigs when I go down on the, um,

Speaker 5:          00:20:01       the, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:20:03       the set there, you know, in between setups, I don't bring my phone or anything cause I just feel like it just takes me out of what little game I have as an actor. I was actually down there and there was a book on a coffee table and I actually started reading it and I was like, this is what I should be doing between fucking, you know, when there was, when there's a long turn around, like it's going to be like a fucking half hour. You don't want to keep doing the lines in your head because then you can be like a robot when you go out there. At least that's how I'm wired. But actually reading a book and old man, Old Lady thing to do, it's fucking, it's the shit that could believe how enjoyable it was. It was actually, it turned out to is Pete Holmes's book, um, comedy God,

Speaker 1:          00:20:40       which I immediately thought was funny. I'm like, all right, is he just doing this thing where he sleeps? Like overly bragging, doing like a run burgundy thing? And it was actually a lot of look forward. I was skimming reading was a lot of it was about like him being brought up in religious and religion, overly religious and getting into stand up. And I read, uh, a couple of chapters of his book and I was trying to find to see if he had mentioned the first time I ever worked with him just to see what his take was on that weekend. The first time I've ever worked with Pete Holmes is I worked in at this comedy club. I don't even if it's still out there, was called Brewster's in Peoria, Illinois. Hometown of the Great Lake. Great Richard Pryor, grace comedian of all time. And um, we did this gig out there.

Speaker 1:          00:21:24       I just remembered it was like mostly a bar and on stage it was sort of done up like this old west kind of thing with like these big whiskey barrels and looking like provisions and shit where uh, like we were going to go onto the fucking Oregon trail or something. We're up on the, uh, up on stage and I believe a long time ago he actually posted a video of him bombing during that weekend and we both went out and watched the ring in an empty movie theater was the two of us and both got scared shitless watching that thing and had a great fucking weekend working with themselves, trying to get to that part where he first moved to New York. But I actually read the part where his marriage first marriage fell apart. Man, that fucking guy's a great writer. So check out that book. It'd be get a chance. There's also another book.

Speaker 5:          00:22:09       MMM, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:22:11       That just came out on Greg Geraldo, which I didn't even know was coming out, so I don't even know who wrote the thing. I just saw Bobby Kelly promoted it on his Instagram. So I'm definitely going to get that book. Um, you know, I don't know. I don't even know how to do with people. I don't know what I'm doing. I'm fucking devastated. I really am devastated. My fucking beloved Bruins lost. And I'm also oddly really happy for Saint Louis, you know, long suffering fans. It's just the weirdest fucking feeling.

Speaker 5:          00:22:45       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:22:45       I was actually sitting there with Bobby and we just don't do you this fucking bullshit. And I was just like, they play or the bed, they're the better team. They're the better team. And when they raised the cop, just seeing how excited the guys actually had a smile on his face and Bobby's looking and it's like, dude, I fucking love this shit. This is the best fucking trophy ever. Um, but I, I would be lying to you if I am not fucking, uh, if I didn't say I wasn't fucking devastated right now. Jesus Christ. And then, then that's it. Thank God for Moto Gp. Thank God I got into motorcycle racing because took to go from the end of the fucking NHL playoffs and just the level of intensity, you know, trying to ease your way, you know, into fucking the dog days of fucking baseball.

Speaker 1:          00:23:36       You know, I, I always equated it must be like what ric flair felt like after doing a road of, you know, of run of wrestling and then cut trying to come home to his family life and trying to come down from fucking woo styling, profiling. I'll let Shane screaming. It's like this fan version of that. So thank God for fucking Moto GP and I get to watch those fucking amazing lunatics race those bikes around a 200 miles an hour. And I'm not shitting on baseball because I do love baseball. Actually. Um, you know, I've been so into the NBA finals in the Stanley Cup final that, you know, the other day when there was a, there was a day off. I actually was like, I have to watch some sort of competition here. And I watched the Yankees mets game and I was able to get into it. Um, I prefer the Yankee feed over the meth feed just because I'm more familiar with that.

Speaker 1:          00:24:27       Michael K and all of that. And I also love listen Depaulo Neil and [inaudible]. But I was just sitting there. I Dunno, I have to tell you this, so let's, let's talk. So in the end, congratulations to the Saint Louis Blues. Congratulations to Billington for proving me wrong. I mean he had just forced stand on your head. Fucking saves in a game. Seven. I mean, you don't get lucky like that. I think the kid is the fucking real deal. All right there. I said it. Um, but I've gotten so into uh, this NBA final finals, Jesus Christ, jumping back and forth here. I was initially for Toronto and I still really kind of am because of the Toronto fans, but I have to play. At first I was making fun of Drake. Now I love them because I find myself watching him when the ball's being brought to court. Like he is so out of his fucking mind.

Speaker 1:          00:25:27       He's, he's literally pacing the sidelines. Like he's coaching the team. Like I was watching them when they were bringing the ball up and he was just manically making this spread, like spread the off fence fucking uh, gesture. And I'm going like, this guy has, has, has lost his fucking mind, like tease doing shit that I do in my living room when I know nobody's watching. He's doing this on television. So part of me, I don't want to run out a win cause I want to see this again. I don't want to see satisfied Drake. I want to see longing for a championship. Drake and a, that last game watching, uh, the warriors show why they fucking champions. You know, and I, I'm not, you know, I didn't get upset with Toronto fans cheering when kd went down. That was, that was fear more so than disrespect. That was just like, oh, thank God this guy is out. All right. Although there was that one cunt in the front row, you know, who was dressed, sort of like, you know, he looked like he listened to fucking remember those awful, uh, rap metal bands from the early two thousands. He looked like a fan of one of those bands and he was like waving bye bye. And it's just like, who the fuck does that? Who does that? Right? Um,

Speaker 5:          00:26:58       so

Speaker 1:          00:27:01       this is what I think happens in that series. I think golden state. I know, but you've got Leonard Leonard is just fucking ice water when you won't even give a fist pound to one of your own fucking players. That's when you know you're in the zone. He's like the fucking Marshawn lynch. Like his attitude when he doesn't give a fuck about anything. Except when you saw that quote, when they split it home and they were going out to golden state and the, the, I must set the teacher, the coach was going, you know, we go out there, we did, we get one, you all we to do is win one game. And he speaks up and said, fuck that. Let's win too. And then they did. He's like fucking John Wayne in a western. So I don't know. I don't actually, I gotta be honest with you. I will be happy either way.

Speaker 5:          00:27:55       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:27:57       Watching this series, no matter what happens, I will, you know, in the end I think I want to see Toronto went a little more just because they haven't won a championship in so long, but like the next championship, I really wanted to see Toronto when it was, I wanted to see them win a cup. Um, you know, I, I will tell you though, anytime I see Toronto fans gathering outside, watching something on a screen, I get a negative feeling going. Like, oh, how many times we've seen this, they gradually start peeling off. It's one of the saddest, slowest, um, departures of a fan base you're ever going to fucking see. But God bless them because they do show up. Um, so I wanted to go seven games. My gut feeling is golden state

Speaker 1:          00:28:43       comes out and wins game six and then loses game seven in Toronto. I just think Toronto might wear him down by that point. Uh, golden state is really banged up. But, uh, I will tell you what would be fucking sick as if Toronto goes into their building and fucking ends their dynasty in their own building. Oh. Oh, you know what, that will take me back to 1985 when Kareem hit that last fucking sky hook. I never forget that. And he ran down the court and he fucking made, he balled up both his fists like that's it. We got these motherfuckers and I was just like, ugh. They finally beat us in the final finals.

[inaudible] um, yeah. Why, why do I keep doing these by my self? I have the Star spangled banner is in my fucking head because the NBA finals in the Nhl finals have have never been on the same night and I've been watching all of them. So that's all I've been hearing every fucking night. Oh, C car and your c. And then when you watch the fucking NHL finals, you also get, Oh, Canada do glory.

Speaker 9:          00:37:02       Pretty Major.

Speaker 8:          00:37:02       Both set up and hockey and some fucking cash boo. The Alaskan pipeline and Fuckin people who think they're from France, um, just every fucking night. And uh, you know, start to fuck with me. Can you guys tell that I have absolutely nothing prepared for this week? Nothing funny to say. Um, I don't, I got nothing. It's a minute. 23 in and I'm ready to pull the fucking plug cause I've got too much shit to do. I'm actually recording this on a Sunday afternoon. A Beautiful, beautiful Sunday, sunny Sunday afternoon. Did you go to church below, Geesh? Uh, no I did not. Although when I was out in the forest, I gotta tell you when I, last week when I thought I was going to get eaten by a bear, I did pray to a higher power. And I know what a lot of people right now, a lot of you, Jesus freaks out there. A lot of you people who were into the old Jay star are probably like, yeah, see, see, you believe you believe. Um, I believe in higher power. Yes, absolutely. But I don't believe in the, in, in, uh, the stories. I don't think he's ever talked to anybody. That's, I think that's what I believe. You know, like today I was in the car and my girl was bugging me and I said to her, you know what? You're really making me want to slap you in the face.

Speaker 8:          00:38:38       You know what it is? She's held that on fucking painting the Goddamn apartment. I don't know why. All right. And I have to do a benefit tonight and then I have to go fucking go straight to the airport and take a red eye to Chicago coming in a day early because I got some friends out there and there, they got some ice time somewhere and you know, why not? I'll fucking come in a day early, play a little hockey, continue my Peter Pan Lifestyle. So of course she's just like, I want to pay to live and grow. We have to get this done. We gotta get drop cloth, we gotta get some paid, Yadda, fucking Yada. Right? So where did she go? I go, all right, what if, where, where are we going? Where are we going? And she's like, we have to go to home depot. All right. Which I fucking hate home depot, I can't stand it.

Speaker 8:          00:39:24       All right with that 900 foot ceilings and they're two employees that they have there and you finally run into one and it's like, you know, first of all you go win the fucking place. And that same feeling I had when I walked into the forest where I was like all alone and I didn't know what the fuck was going to happen. That's what you feel like when you go into these, these superstores is, they call them and then you walk in there when you finally fucking find somebody, you know, oh that's not my department. I just do window shades. You know, back in the day when you walked into a hardware store, the fucking person knew the whole goddamn store, first of all, because it was only the size of a, I dunno, I dunno. I've store and I know all you guys out there who get on your knees and slurp the corporate cock are going to tell me, well, you didn't have as many selections. Go Fuck Yourself. All right, swallow the load and kill yourself. Because though the old school hardware stores, they were better. You walk in, there was some grumpy guy there and you'd be like, yeah, I need a fucking widget and a no, no, no, no fucking shower curtain rink. And he'd look up, you know from some shitty was whittling on, he tell you exactly what the fuck it was and he continue whittling as a corner of his eye. He looked at you as you went in the wrong,

Speaker 10:         00:40:42       you written that down a on a bottom bottom.

Speaker 8:          00:40:47       You were one of those guys. Now you've got all those Douche bags out there, right? People work at home depot, basically people who couldn't get a job at the apple store, you know, they couldn't get one of those genius tee shirts and now they get an orange apron and then he'd just stand around. You know, you're looking at their nails. I don't know what. So anyways, we get down to this fucking place and uh, as we're driving there, all right? Evidently, whatever paint she wants to get, I wasn't involved in this fucking decision, you know? Um, whatever the brand is, we're on our way over there, which I really don't have time to do. She goes, oh my God, I hope they have, you know, Eddie Rabinowitz's, eggshell fucking Robin egg white or whatever the fuck she talking about. And immediately my head, I'm like, why didn't you call ahead?

Speaker 8:          00:41:36       Why didn't you call ahead? So what do you think happened everybody? What do you think happened? We went into the, the fucking monstrosity that is home depot with their 40,000 fucking different selections. Guess what? They didn't have the Eddie Rabinowitz, Robin Egg, fucking blue, God damn coffee cream, whatever the fuck it was called. They didn't have it. So immediately I get pissed. So she looks for a silver lining. Well at least they got drop cloth. Um, so then we got to get out of this some shit I didn't have fucking time to do anyways in judge. She wants me to stop and Mcdonald to go get her a fucking, uh, the lemonade frozen Frisbee or whatever the fuck drink they have there. And I'm like, no, I'm not doing it. I don't have time. So of course she starts pouting. So what do I do? I give in like a fag.

Speaker 8:          00:42:30       I given, you know, and I was sitting there and the God damn fucking line and uh, you know, Mcdonald's is hilarious now. Evidently they're trying to go healthy. I think the biggest loser is really starting to fuck with these fast food places. Cause all these fatties are finally realizing, Oh really? I can't have three, 7,000 calorie triple double cheeseburgers with Bacon on it. Evidently that's the reason why I have this slab of shit that's covering my knees at this point. Forget about my genitalia. I think they, uh, the biggest loser, I think that they've actually had an effect because I went there and you could actually get like a Waldorf salad or some shit, some salad with like an apple in, which was hilarious because you know, it's sucks. It's still somehow, and then they had like some low fat yogurt with WWE is, as long as Mcdonald's is doing it, it's somehow still going to come out to about 9,000 calories. So a, what the fuck was my point here? Let's talking about slapping her in the face.

Speaker 11:         00:43:28       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:43:29       Oh, that's what I said. I'm a slapping the face. Ah, Jesus Christ. I was going somewhere with this. The fuck was I talking about? How did I get into this is talking about going in the woods. Ah, Jesus ain't no, I don't even fucking remember. I'm such a long winded jackass. What the fuck was I talking about? There's something about slapped her in the face and then I didn't do that and that tied into some other shit that I can't fucking remember. Ah, fuck. Why do I try? Oh, it's talking about church, right? Why don't believe all that's right. That's right. Church. There we go. We're back on track. Everybody back on track. So I said, I'm going to, I really feel like slapping you in the face, this is when we want in the way of the Mcdonald's. And she goes, you know, obviously looking at him, looking at me like, don't do that. So I go, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to slap Jesus instead because she's into rosaries, you know, and she has it hanging from the fucking rear view mirror of our stupid Prius. So I'm gonna do, I'm gonna slap Jesus. Anyway, so he's sitting there on the cross, of course, always in that moment, look what I did for you. Right? So I just fucking slap them right on the cross and he flies back and forth. So she starts giving me shit. Don't slap Jesus. Right.

Speaker 8:          00:44:51       And uh, yeah, that's when I just kind of said, you know, he really think that this happened, that God, you know, took out as giant fucking hire being dick came into this fucking petri dish, the size of a Jacuzzi. Right. And then took out some sort of syringe in artificially inseminated. Uh, what's her face there? Jennifer was that was at his mom's name. Right.

Speaker 12:         00:45:16       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:45:18       Do you really think that happened? It didn't, it didn't happen. Am I saying there's not a higher power? No, I'm not saying that. I'm just saying all these fucking stories that they're telling you are there that made up, this guy did the, uh, you know, we came out of a womb that was never in a banged and uh, then he died for you when the only way to get into heaven is if you do what we say and uh, give us some money. I mean, how fucking dumb are you if you go into that shit, I can't help you. I can't fucking help you. But if you want to talk about a higher power, definitely believe in that shit. But none of us know what it is. I don't believe. I don't, I don't fucking know. I don't know where you go. I don't know what happens, but uh, neither does anybody else cause you read it in a book.

Speaker 8:          00:46:15       What happens when you die? Who wrote it? Who exactly wrote it? How dumb do I sound right now at all? You, Jesus freaks. Y'All rolling your eyes as you write with your feathered pen to punish yourself for some bullshit that you did. Um, here's something for you. I don't believe in ghosts either, right? We're just going to go right down the line of shit that I don't believe in. I don't believe in Jesus and I don't believe in ghosts, but, uh, I gotta admit this. Some sort of paranormal shit been going on in my fucking apartment lately. All right? We went on vacation, we came back and all our forks are missing except for two of them,

Speaker 8:          00:46:56       you know, and on two different occasions I've been playing guitar. I get up out of my little fucking play pen area, slash, office, and, uh, I walk in to talk to NEA and then I come back in. My settings are different on my fucking amp. So, uh, I think considering that the ghost stole my forks in his fucking with my amps, there's only one logical conclusion that this spirit, uh, died at a Scorpions concert. That's what happened. All right? And the only heavy metal fans got debt. Remember that? That song, there's no one like you and the guy had the forks in his eyes. Remember that Shit. I think that that's what's going on. So I'm going to be on the next season of a ghost hunters and I'm going to sit in there with some douche bag with a video camera yelling at the ghost. You have exactly four minutes to show yourself. Do you ever see that? Have I talked about that? How ridiculous that fucking show ghost hunters is? Those fucking idiots sit around yelling at the, they always somehow, first of all, they always know that ghosts name and they'll just be sitting there yelling at the ghost, like threatening, like threatening this spirit that evidently is, is hanging out in a kitchen for all eternity. You know Maggie, we know you're here. Alright, we're getting sick at this. You got four minutes to show yourself or packing up all our equipment.

Speaker 11:         00:48:35       Okay.

Speaker 8:          00:48:35       Right. And what do you think Maggie? Sinking. We'll do it. I don't give a fuck. This is the most entertaining shit ever. Sit here. Frustrating you guys. How, flicking the year, my little ghosts, fingers on the way up.

Speaker 8:          00:48:49       You guys believe in ghosts. Do you believe in that shit? I was actually watching a, there's some fucking channel, I can't remember the names of anything. It's called like Payola or something. Pirelli that's a tire or they, they have all these fucking unplugged, uh, sets by these bands. That's my computer making all that noise. And uh, I was watching one. Uh, you know, when you get to be old like me, he w you just lose touch with modern music, but there's bands that you just, you keep hearing their fall out boy, and I'll fuck you while you young people. Oh my God. That's like Thoreau, 2000, whatever. I don't give a fuck. I'm just saying they blend in. So one of them was my morning jacket. All right. Now when I grew up, no one would name a band my morning jacket. All right. You'd name it something that had to do with Satan or else I wasn't going to listen to it. So whenever I heard my morning jacket that just sounded like, uh, you know, it was going to be like that Jack Johnson's kind of stuff. You know, that shit that like women and hippies like.

Speaker 13:         00:49:57       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:49:59       Um, so I, I never listen to it, you know, I just thought it was going to be more like that fallout boy. Like that whining, crying. I remember like the last 10 years, that emo shit where, where was that song that, that I, I made fun of that one week.

Speaker 13:         00:50:18       [inaudible] two. Does

Speaker 8:          00:50:20       that sound like you're going to win anything? That sounds like you're already lost and you're walking home crying to your mom and you just talking shit cause you to fucking embarrassed knowing you lost. So I assumed that they were kind of like that and uh, I dunno man. I watched their, if they're unplugged set, they were fucking unbelievable and I want to download some of their shit. All right, legally. So let me know how's your latest album? Because there was somebody else who was on like leaky Lee was on before and I watched her shit and I loved it. And then I listened to it on iTunes and I was like, ah, the unplugged shit sounded way better. Her shit was like singing through all this distortion stuff. I, which I can't stand after a while, you know, it's like, bitch, just sing the Goddamn song.

Speaker 8:          00:51:08       Okay, stop sounding like you're fucking, I'm listening to it. Three floors above you. You know, if you're going to do some shit like that, do it the way Jimmy page did it and I felt like I was in on acid. You know how he used to do that shit and he and he would have it you back in the day you would listen to albums on headphones and bands knew it and they knew you were on drugs and they used to try to enhance the experience. That's how great rock used to be. Okay. That's how into drugs they were, they knew you were on drugs so they would make album and they were on drugs and they would make albums that would make being on drugs feel better and they used to do shit where they would, they wouldn't, whatever. They'd have some sort of some sort of effect going on and they would, they would make it go from the left side to the right side, just your speakers. But when you had headphones on, it felt like it pass through your Goddamn head is tremendous.

Speaker 8:          00:52:09       I don't know. I don't know what the fuck they do. The yell into a bullhorn throughout the whole fucking concert into a microphone like that. That's the best you can do. Who does that Shit, you know, does that all the time? Is that Guy Scott Weiland said his name, the guy from STP velvet revolver. He's big into that. Singing through the fucking bullhorn is he walks around in his a Nazi supermodel outfit. Anyways, this is the Monday morning podcast. Everybody, are you a new listener? I hope you are. I hope we continue to grow this podcast. Uh, I do one of these every God damn week and people send me questions. They asked for advice. They send me lists of underrated, overrated. We talk about Youtube fucking videos that we like. I curse a lot because I don't read. I'm not intelligent. Um, all right. Speaking of youtube videos, which I keep forgetting to talk about.

Speaker 8:          00:53:07       Um, I got a bunch at this point. Here's one you got to walk on. These are all, by the way, all of these can be viewed exclusively@theemmpodcast.com. Um, first off, I did another tour of a, you know, those videos I make where I do like the tours of Los Angeles and show you different parts of La. I'm actually, uh, I did want to New York City, um, and we just put that up so we'll have that on the MLM podcast page. And, uh, do you remember when I was sick a few weeks ago and I felt like Shit and all that, uh, this video was shot the day that I was getting sick. Notice when I'm on the subway, when I'm walking down there, look at the, the flop sweat on my giant forehead as I'm starting to get sick. Um, we got that and here's, here's a video that has since blown up, which pisses me off because I've been meaning to talk about this one for a month.

Speaker 8:          00:53:57       There's one a video called fan escapes. Um, I don't know if I talked to, I don't think I talked about this one yet. Um, it's basically some kid at an Astros game. He jumps out of the stands, runs across right field, gives a great head fake to a security guard, breaks his ankles. He goes up and over the wall. He just, and just fucking amazing. He basically climbs up the stadium and runs out the back of it. And as far as I know, he got away and uh, I would love a lot of Europeans to watch this. Who think every Americans are fat. Fuck, you should see this guy. This guy does like a good four or five pull ups and climbs up out of a stadium from basically center field. It's amazing. So definitely check that one out. There's another good one out there that I was watching called.

Speaker 8:          00:54:50       Uh, it's basically, uh, how to, how to talk to cops. And this one's funny because uh, you could live to people who actually are doing it, are actually complete dirt bags, but they know their rights probably cause they be getting arrested their entire life. And it's really fascinating. I saw this video a long time ago about how many rights you give up when the cops pull you over simply because you don't, you don't know the law and they just ask you questions. Like in this video, the guy goes, because the guy was videotaping, the copy comes over. He goes, when he videotaped me for, he goes, can I see that camera please? Now most people, 90% of you would be like, yes officer, here you go, because you're, you're, you don't want to get arrested. This guy was like, no. And the cop goes, why can't I?

Speaker 8:          00:55:36       The camera goes, AH, cause it's mine and you need a search warrant. And he just started rattling off this shit. And the cops just like at fuck, he knows the rule. I don't know if he knows it needs a search warrant, but you know, he needs probable cause. I'm video taping, it's illegal. It's not illegal to videotape. And he just, he stonewalls the guy and he goes, and I'm on my property, you're actually on my property, get off my property police. And every time he says the shit, you're like, oh my God, he comes to the beat down. But it never fucking happens. But who's kidding, who? The only reason why it goes down like this is because there's witnesses. There's too many people standing around because of this guy tried this shit in the middle of nowhere with a cop. The, the video camera would be up his ass and uh, he would also be facing some sort of charges of assaulting the police officer because the police sprained one of his fingers when he shoved the camera up his ass.

Speaker 8:          00:56:27       Um, at least that's been my experience. Um, what are the youtube videos? Let me make sure I read all of these. Let me show you and show, you know they used to, before I move onto the next topics here, uh, for Christ sake, where the fuck fucker, the other youtube videos. Oh, this is a good one. I think we actually did this one a long time ago. Uh, boyfriend, fuck you. Uh, you have to do that shit. We hit on a girlfriend. She lets you get on a girlfriend. He hit on some girl and she lets you do it for 10 minutes and then brings up her boyfriend, uh, this guy does the reaction that you want to do, uh, to call boyfriend. Fuck you. And then we got some music ones here, a crossroads festival. Uh, Steve Winward, Eric Clapton and Steve Jordan, my favorite drummer and Derek trucks. Um, what else do we got here?

Speaker 8:          00:57:16       Mark? Knopfler I haven't even looked at these. I've been so goddamn busy. We've got some, uh, music ones this week and a, what the fuck was the other one? Oh, I know what I wanted to talk about. You guys. Do you guys, do you have a guilty pleasure movie that you watch that you would be unbelievably embarrassed that other people would know that anytime you see it you definitely watch it. This is mine. It's actually called the good bye girl, which is arguably one of the gayest fucking movies of all time. All right. But what I love about it, the reason why I like it is cause it's Richard Dreyfus, his first big role. And I'm a big Richard Dreyfus Fan and I just love it because you see a guy seizing the opportunity that he's got this role and he just, he just goes all out. It's a total fucking chick flick or whatever.

Speaker 8:          00:58:08       But I dunno, he's always funny to me and the amount of shit that he has to do in the movie that I would be embarrassed to do when he pulls it off is why I always end up watching the movie. But, and I never watch it from beginning to end. I always catch it at some point. Plus I'm a sucker for any movie that's shot in New York and I get to see what New York used to look like. So that's another reason why I love watching that movie. And uh, it's just a great movie and a lot of different levels. There's another level where the only people of Color in that movie play muggers. Like you really see what the fuck's spike Lee is complaining about. When you fucking see, it's like, it's so like how white they make New York is unbelievable. This just wall the wall.

Speaker 8:          00:58:53       Fuck everybody's white. And then at one point though, gets her grocery stolen. So wretched drivers runs after this car load of people and out of the car jumps like two Puerto Ricans and a black guy and they get fucking Afros and knives. All of a sudden it turns into death. Wish this chick flick for like half a second. It's completely unnecessary in the plot in the movie other than to just remind why people to be racist. Um, but that's not what I wanted to talk about in that movie. What really interests me in that movie is I mentioned a zillion times as I drive a Toyota Prius and uh, when I drive it properly and I'm not slamming on the brakes and stop it on the gas, I can get 41 miles per gallon. Okay. Which is supposed to be good because a lot of shit gets 23, 25.

Speaker 8:          00:59:48       Now I've maintained for a while. Now that car's in the 70s, used to get like 33 35 miles of fucking gallon. And that's Goddamn almost, you know, 35, 40 years ago in this movie, this chick flick, the goodbye girl, that chick that, uh, Dreyfus is, is falling for. She's actually, you guys ever go to a car show, you know, they show all the, uh, whatever this year they, uh, coming up in October, they'll start having the car show and they have all the 2012, um, models that are coming out and speaking of models that have these broad standing next to him, at least they did back in the day, unless they consider it too sexist, they'd have good looking women standing there talking about the car. So anyways, her character does that in this movie and it's like, it's like 76, 1977, something like that. And she's standing in front of this Subaru talking about the car and says it gets 39 miles per gallon.

Speaker 8:          01:00:44       All right. See, this is why I don't believe in Shit. I don't believe in fucking anything. This is why everybody thinks, oh, you're paranoid. You're a fucking conspiracy theory. That's it. Fucking right there. 39 miles per gallon on this fucking all wheel drive Subaru or are those things back there weren't oh yeah, four wheel drive. Subaru got 39 miles per gallon. That was their claim. Okay. That's 19 fucking 76 or 77 you're telling me in 35 years, the best we've been able to do is get me an extra two miles per gallon on a fucking hybrid. It's complete bullshit. I think there's plenty of fucking oil and it's the whole thing's horseshit. You know what time I was riding, I was riding in a cab in New York City and this Pakistanian Dude was driving it, you know, surprise, surprise. And uh, I was talking to them about, I always like, I love talking to people who don't live here, you know who or who initially didn't live here and now live here.

Speaker 8:          01:01:52       Just getting their whole viewpoint on shit. Whether I agree with it or not, it's just interesting to me. So I was talking to him, this is the first time the gas prices were going through the fucking roof. And he says to me, he goes, do you know a Toyota Camry in this country? Gets like whatever the fuck it was at the time, 2125 miles per gallon. He goes, do you know in my country it gets like 38 39 miles per gallon or like 40 something ridiculous. He goes, do you know why that is? And I said, no. And he goes, because we can't afford a car that gets 23 to 25 miles per gallon because I guess where they live, whatever the fucking gas prices are, whatever their fucking economy is, they can't afford a car that gets that amount of miles. So they just adjust the goddamn engine.

Speaker 8:          01:02:35       That's what I'm saying, people's, that's all bullshit. I don't know where I'm going with this stuff and I don't know who to complain to. What about all those grease monkeys out there? You sit there and you watch these fucking shows on TV where they, they, they do like a build. They'll have some car, you know, like we're at Tate today. Well, you're not going to believe where we're going to do. We got a 1972 fucking GMC Willie's garbage truck and we're going to combine that with the 1975 Porsche nine 11. It's all gonna look fucking sweet. And they somehow do it. The fucking car runs and it fucking got like nine wheels and he goes flying down the street. He's got a fish tank in the back. Right. Why don't they use that talent to fuck with the engine and get it to get it to make like, you know, like a hundred miles per gallon or any of my podcasts listeners out there. Do you know how to do that shit?

Speaker 8:          01:03:27       Is it that fucking hard? Isn't it just a couple of twists of the screwdriver on a carburetor? Do they have carburetors anymore? Ah, Christ. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Let's, let's plow ahead. Everybody he's getting into conspiracy theory. Oh Gee, he, um, all right, let's go with advice here. Um, you know, like always, somebody sent me one and I can't remember, uh, with a fuck I put it, but some lady came over here from England and she lives just north of New York City. And, uh, she loves living here. She loves the excess of America is what she said, but her husband is, she said it's driving him nuts because he's an environmentalist and he is taking the environmentalist stance to the point that he won't flush the toilet when he just takes a piss. So she goes walking into the loo as she calls it and he's got his fucking piss in there and she's like, well what do I do about this is what you do, lady, you got to tell, just put a fucking brick or a stone in the back of your toilet so you won't use as much water and tell the dude to flush the Goddamn toilet.

Speaker 8:          01:04:32       Okay?

Speaker 11:         01:04:34       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:04:34       Just tell him to flush the toilet. I'm all for trying to conserve but flush the fucking toilet. All right. And furthermore, I don't like your attitude though, cause she did the classic where, you know, he's doing all this other stuff too for the environment. Like it's gonna matter. I hate people who've got that defeat us attitude. That's not going to fucking matter. You know, like when you vote for Ron Paul and they tell you that you wasted your vote by voting for somebody who's actually being honest, whether you agree with them or not. Like that's a wasted vote. I'll really waste it's a wasted vote to vote for that guy to try encourage more people like that who don't give a fuck to run for office. No, he's not gonna so that, that's why you vote. You vote cause you want to vote for a winner.

Speaker 8:          01:05:24       Ah, Jesus. That's depressing. The speaking of fucking depressing the fucking Stanley Cup finals this year. I can anybody figure it out? I think this has been one of the most torturous finals, um, for fans on both sides. God knows those connect cons wouldn't admit to it because now there were up three games to two, but you can't tell me during game three and four you weren't like, what the fuck happened to my team? Why are they playing like a bunch of pussies and allowing themselves to be pushed all over the ice? That's what's happened. Every home game. The visiting team just gets smashed in the mouth and does nothing about it. It's fucking driving me nuts. All right, I'm getting sick of you. Fucking cannot fans talk and shit like your team is fucking superior. You've won three one goal games. The twins. What have they done? Shit. They haven't done shit. What is Ryan Kessler done? Shit. He's done nothing. What about that fucking that God damn Lou Longo with his sad basset hound eyes behind his goalie mask. You bunch of punks. I actually liked your fucking team until we played you guys in the amount of shit. You guys have been talking.

Speaker 8:          01:06:47       I actually used to like your fucking team. I would have rooted for the, if the Bruins weren't in, I would have wrote it for the Canucks cause they never won one. But their fans are such con oh at their stupid hankies that they have during the Goddamn game. You only people who should do that. Our Pittsburgh Steeler fans, they came up with it. It was the terrible towel. Anyone else who does it? It's fucking gay and I can't wait for the Bruins win game six and game seven. So you fucking pussies are crying in your Goddamn hankies Jesus Christ. This is the thing though. I actually think they're a great team and they've got a tremendous amount of talent on there, but those mother fuckers are the cheapest sons of bitches I've ever seen in my life. I don't mind the hits. I don't mind that shit. You know, it happens.

Speaker 8:          01:07:34       All right. But the fucking, the diving and the flopping. Hey, I asked this the other day, uh, I was on Tsn, which is the ESPN up in Canada. I called in and I asked this, can some hockey fan please explain to me. All right. And one of the Games, the last game actually gained five all right. There at the lining up for a face off in a Burroughs is right next to Luke Cheech. So what he does is he puts his leg in front of Lucita stick and then just does a prat fall and acts like he trips. Okay. Now, I would think that either he get two minutes for diving or they would call Cheech for tripping because they didn't realize that, you know, that they got faked out. But for some reason Lou Cheech got two minutes for tripping and Burroughs get two minutes for embellishment or something stupid like that. I don't get that. It's like he either fucking trip the guy redundant. What does that penalty mean? Like, okay, he tripped you but he didn't trip you that bad. I don't know. I've had it in the fucking goddamn twins. Jesus Christ did [inaudible] flopping all over the fucking ice. That's how you want to win a cup, Vancouver. That's how you want to do it by pretending you got hurt.

Speaker 14:         01:08:56       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:08:57       Fucking shameless. Just a shameless fucking hockey team. I got no, I'd have absolutely no fucking respect for like I've lost all fucking respect for that Goddamn team and I can't believe it. There's no fucking reason for them to be doing that shit. They got enough weapons. They sort of have a good goaltender and there were great physical team. Why do you gotta play like fags? You know? Why is that what you guys do out there in Vancouver? Is that what you do when you're not going out on a fucking whale watch and listen to, to your euro trash music with your awful tight clothes that you wear up there at been to Vancouver for about 20 minutes. Beautiful scenery. If you're not looking at the people, um, uh, I can't wait to play Tampa or Vancouver just for the fan that actually takes this shit seriously. Um, anyways, plowing ahead, plowing ahead. Speaking of a,

Speaker 8:          01:09:57       speaking of what the fuck was I talking about? Oh, gay and all that type of stuff. A certain comedian got into a bunch of trouble for a bunch of stuff he said during a, during a, uh, during a standup performance and uh, people got offended and a, this really bugged me. I was watching a news program. I was watching a program that involved the news and this dude came on and the comedian apologized and they asked him what he thought he could go in. The guy was just like, well, you know, I think the apology was good, but I don't think it's enough. I think he should donate some money to the fucking blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And it just, it just killed the whole fucking thing for me. It killed the outrage. I should really just look at the guy at that. It's like, really at the end of it, all you want to do is just get some fucking money out of the guy. You know? I, I don't understand that. I really don't.

Speaker 8:          01:10:54       You know, somebody does something and then they apologize. That should be enough. You got, that's not enough. You've got to take the money out of his fucking wallet, you know? So if that's the case, then you really don't give a shit about the apology. You just want it. So you just using it as an, as an excuse to get some fucking money. Right? Yeah. Does that make any fucking sense? I Dunno. I'm basically judging the entire topic because of that one Douche I saw on TV. All right, let's plow ahead here before I have to fucking apologize to somebody. Um, uh, people of Vancouver. Do you think that is his, his apology that he made fun of your white belts and white shoes, your herb Tarlek euro trash way of fucking dressing at your dance clubs? The fact that he apologized, was that enough? Um, I don't think it's quite enough.

Speaker 8:          01:11:40       I think he should make a donation to the Vancouver, a mountainous region. Ag. Go Fuck Yourself. All right, dear bill, I am from Kansas City and there is currently radio commercials in which a law officer, a law, a law office, offers their services exclusively for women going through a divorce. Of course, they do this a ton of money involved there. Uh, they talk about how they were view all of the husband's finances and ensure the woman will receive the maximum amount the law will allow. And then he writes in capital letters. What the fuck are there any law offices that offer services exclusively for men? I doubted if there were, I would imagine there would be a huge protest from feminists all across the U S I know you've addressed this hundreds of times over, but why is it okay k to completely fuck a man over this commercial insinuates the man is already in the wrong.

Speaker 8:          01:12:42       This is absolute bullshit dude. Yet preach on this guys is speaking the Gospel here. Anyways, wanted to share this with you as, this is just another example of man bashing commercials. That just pissed me off. Um, all right, let's, let's, let's review this. Ah, yeah. Okay. First of all, he can't get mad at the lawyers because a, they're just going with the monies and um, and as you, as you, as you say that, if it was the opposite way that there would be feminist groups protesting. All right. That there in lies the fucking problem until men actually get together and start protesting that type of shit, which I would absolutely love to be a part of on any fucking level. I would love to see that happen. But what guys, we don't do that shit once we get you get punched in the face. Yeah. Fuck you. You get up and you walk away. Like you can't do that. Like, yeah, this should be guys protesting it. I think that would be fucking hilarious. Um, that's absolutely terrifying. That's one of 9 million reasons why I never got fucking married. That is just unfucking believable.

Speaker 3:          01:14:01       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:14:01       You know, I'll tell you what kills me is most women who would watch that, they always say the same thing. When you liked, you'll say to them like, can you believe that shit when they always say that saint? Yup. That's right. That's right. Yeah. That's what you get. That's what you get a big, stupid face. What the fuck? Have you ever done that? That's my whole, my whole thing with dad is just a, I don't know, you get married, you just better pray to God. It fucking works out. There's a guy that's all you have and the amount of power, it's not, it's not a balanced relationship because of the way that the divorce laws are. It's the second, you know, it's like when your single, you have an unbelievable amount of power as a guy, even if you're in a relationship, because that she, she can't get to you legally.

Speaker 8:          01:14:52       That's it. It's fucking over. You have your shit and that's it. And you're a guy and you can earn a fucking living and that's it. You don't have to worry about shit. And then the second you get married, you lose all power. Cause at any point should she can just divorce you and fucking take you for everything. You're worth, everything you work for. It's, it's just, it's fucking over. Look at tiger woods. Tiger Woods gave his wife a quarter of a billion dollars. She was a nanny. Fucking nanny were what? Nine figures for what she, he had a prenup was she was only going to get $5 million, only $5 million. Who here wouldn't kill for $5 million? I quit my podcast for a fucking 200 grand.

Speaker 8:          01:15:44       You know, you find out your husband, some dog going around cheating or whatever. That's, that happens to women. And the guy's a broke ass son of a bitch and they're left with nothing. So it's not like women always make out, but here's the situation. We find that your husband's a dog. The marriage is over. Oh, but I get $5 million, but that's not enough for the cont cause she knows he has a billion and she wants to get as much as that as she can. I swear to fucking God, I can't do these topics because it makes you see red because they're not entitled to it. It's bullshit. All right? If you marry the greatest golfer of a fucking generation who's won 14 titles, okay. And you haven't even won a game, a tiddly winks on a professional level, you're not entitled to that money. You're not. You are illegally, but you're not. You didn't fucking earn it. You can't. Ah, right. There you go, Bill. Get to the core of the hatred. All right, number two. Um, Bill, really the fucking new Norwegians get you for multiple gigs and London gets one night. Uh, you know how you know they hate, wait a minute too. What are you talking about?

Speaker 8:          01:16:59       The Norwegians. Okay. You're talking about the whole Scandinavian area. I'm in a different country every night. I'm an, I'm an England one night than Finland than Norway, Norway than and then Sweden. All right. That's totally equal. What are you bitching about? Uh, not to mention I already played London and I, the place was three quarters full. I don't think I need to do a week of dates there in front of nine, nine people per show. Um, alright bill. Really the fucking Norwegians get you. Get you for multiple gigs in London. Gets one night.

Speaker 11:         01:17:31       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:17:32       And I can't even, I don't know what he says here. You know they hate America Q over in Sweden too, right? What does that m e R I C U h l have to look that up. I don't know what that is. Are you trying to fill some sort of urge to pal around with people who are whiter than yourself? Well then look no further than London, sir. They are so white. They eat their pizza with forks and knives. Um, you what you think because you've been here before. You can just do London in a night and peace out. I use some sort of Anglo expert now. I'm just fucking around. Glad you give in London at least one night. Look forward to seeing you figures. I discover your con, uh, comedy after I move out to Los Angeles while I'm out here in Los Angeles. Sir, if you'd like to see me, I'm doing a, a benefit for a Greg Geraldo's wife and a family at the Wiltern theater. Um, what the hell's the fucking date? Ah, Jesus. They're built. How do you not know where the fuck you gonna be? Oh, you know what? I know when the fuck it is. It's uh, June 29th at the Wiltern theater. All right. Not only can you see me, sorry. You can see a bunch of other comics doing their fucking thing. All right, Jeff Ross is going to be out there. Slappy white. We're going to have a bunch of big names. I'm all right.

Speaker 8:          01:18:53       What is, oh, I can see. Email wasn't done here. By the way, that email you read from that guy who claimed to be French at a bunch of condescending misinformation in it. Right? That guy back and tell him he's a prick just like all the rest of the French, uh, per regions or otherwise. Francis full of garlic, eating pseudo mustache, having dickheads. Granted there women are clean shaven though. Uh, too bad. The majority of them look like dudes regardless.

Speaker 14:         01:19:21       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:19:21       Now why do you think he's saying all that shit people? Do you know why that is? It's because his country, his next to France, nobody likes the country. They're next to write. Although I do like Canada except for a Canadian Martirio Canadian fence and uh, even Vancouver connect fans with your hankies. Okay. In your prayer. False eight. When they, all those pratfalls that they do, do they play like a Benny Hill music at the beginning of the, of uh, whenever Vancouver has a home game, when they show the highlights and they got Wayne Wayne man pick a Dane, Dane, an amp, amp and name and name an nap. And then you show everybody flopping around on the fucking ice laughing cause they're cheating.

Speaker 14:         01:20:05       Okay,

Speaker 8:          01:20:05       you got a hell of a team and you might the cup. But Jesus Christ. How about next year? How about next year? You make some sort of vow that you're going to have some sort of fucking code of honors, something. Jesus. His whole fucking series. Which one of the sendings was it? Was it that fucking flopped onto his back and the ref didn't even call it? And when he got up, someone on the Bruins were going, was going, are you okay? Y'All right. Everything okay? Oh Jesus. What a bunch of pussies. Um, alright. Overrated. Underrated for this. Wreak a underrated jerking off on the clock.

Speaker 8:          01:20:46       Everyone should do this once in their lifetime. You might as well be getting blow by what? By your boss's wife. Oh, that's fucking hilarious. Yeah, but where do you do it? And then the odds are getting caught. That's a, that's part of the excitement. Fucking Weirdo jerking off at work were where exactly. Oh, jerking off on the clock. Oh, I see. So what, uh, you know what? I'm going home for lunch. Then you go back and you jerk off. Oh, but on lunch, you know on the clock, sir, could you please are, could you please elaborate and let me know where exactly it is that you jerk off at work. Any of my listeners and you guys, you have a jerk off at work has, is this what the podcast is this what it really has come down to. Anybody else ever rub one out at fucking work and when you do, what do you go? Obviously the bathroom. Wow. I mean you really risking your fucking career there. If you get caught rubbing one out. I'm trying to think of a job that you could have where you could get caught rubbing one out at work and people would laugh it off. Obviously a comedian, you know, if you will rub it, went out in the green room as long as you sold the rum out. You know, that's the amazing thing about show business. I was thinking about this shit the other day, that if you, if say you killed somebody, you committed murder, but it was judged a crime of passion.

Speaker 8:          01:22:14       You know, you lost your shit, you fucking killed somebody. So you go in a jail for at least 15 years. Okay, so 15 years, 17 years you get out, where are you going to get a Goddamn job? Okay. Other than just continuing to be a criminal, you know, selling drugs or some shit. You know, there's only two places that you, I think that you can get a job. You can become like a car salesman cause they don't give a fuck, you know, or you can get into show business. It's fucking amazing. You can cut, you can do a little walk right out of prison. If anybody is in prison listening to this shit. You know, if you have these privileges, you can get out of prison, you know, after doing 17 years. And then they hand you your fucking Xe Kava cheese that you wore when you walked into prison back and fucking 1993

Speaker 8:          01:23:09       with your goatee. And I can't believe Kurt Cobain just killed himself. Tee Shirt, right? Within a week, you could sign up for [inaudible], right? First fucking day, you go out to sign up for an open mic. You could write five minutes material and you could be on stage telling jokes within a fucking week. And not only could you be, not only would you be accepted when other comedians found out that you murdered somebody, their reaction wouldn't be like, holy fuck, you're a piece of shit. They would just be like, dude, dude, you should talk about that on stage. That, that could be your hook, man. You go up in your orange jumpsuit, right? You let people know that you killed somebody. And then first of all, no one's going to fucking hackle. Yeah. And then he can intimidate the crowd that if they don't laugh at your jokes, you're going to go be a fuck.

Speaker 8:          01:23:57       Do it again. You know, I was actually talking to somebody about that the other day about, you know, that's, that's a conversation that guys have a lot about. Do you think you could survive if you went to prison? And, uh, I was talking to Keith Robinson, uh, about this shit. And, uh, I was telling him that I would go into prison and I would immediately joined the area nation immediately. I would, I would have a bic pen out if I smuggled it in. I wouldn't have, would be drawing the swastika between my eyes, not because I believe in that shit. I just don't want to get raped.

Speaker 14:         01:24:38       So

Speaker 8:          01:24:39       I would be drawing that in on the bus ride into the prison. And I told Keith, you know, no offense that if I did see him in prison, I would have to call them the n word. I just would just, you know, not out of some racist shit. I just, I would not want, I just don't want to get raped and I have to bond with the fucking, uh, the psycho a, the psycho fucking, uh, what do you call them? What do you call those guys? The white supremacists. And I'd have to sit there listening to their awful music. I remember that from American history. X rent with that fatty was in the van singing the white man marches.

Speaker 8:          01:25:25       Oh, would I be counting down the fucking days? Jesus Christ. But you'd have to do it. You'd have to do it. You'd have to become a full on fucking area in maniac. But what are your, what are your options? You know? I mean, I'm all for, you know, not being racist, 100% all about it. I think it's ignorant and all that type of shit, but I draw the line at getting fucked in the ass. All right, fuck that. Fuck that noise, son. I'll say some shit that will make fucking a Charles Manson blush. Ah, well maybe that's the guy I'd knock out, can walking up to him with his vampire fingernails and just fucking slap the beard right off his face. Maybe that would prevent it. I don't know if anybody's ever been to prison. What exactly? Someone like me right before I commit to going in there and just shaving my head and acting like a, I'm part of the area in nation because that's the only way I see, you know, getting out of it. If anybody who's been listening to this shit has been to prison, how does a Ron Howard, Ralph mouth looking jackass like myself who hasn't had a fist fight since junior high outside of his family?

Speaker 8:          01:26:44       Um, how do, how do you survive? How do you do it? And that's the only option I can think. I got to go in there and I, I got to hang, oh Jesus. Then I'd have to get a bunch of awful tattoos. Ah, AH, Jesus Christ. I'd probably just kill myself. That's what I was joking about that. But then I wouldn't have the nerve to do it and then I'd get raped and then I'd be thinking as I was getting raped going, fuck, I should've done it earlier because now I got to kill myself. It's fucking unreal. So anyways, whenever you see these fucking people, when they, they, I remember long time ago there was some, like some kid in New York City, it was this classic case where he, he killed his girlfriend and he said that they were having rough sex and it got out of control.

Speaker 8:          01:27:39       Right. Which is complete horseshit. He killed her. Right. But that's what he said. So anyways, he ended up doing all of his time because he kept getting busted for shit. So when he was getting a in prison, so like they were talking about, uh, they were talking about him getting out. I remember he was getting out and they're like, so and so's getting out of prison, the, you know, the famous case, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And evidently he was quite a busy man when he was in prison and they start giving him shit going. Like he got busted on numerous occasions for selling drugs. He got into a couple of altercations with the guards and other inmates and they're talking about him like, he should have been there coloring. It's like, no, he was doing what he had to do so he didn't become somebody's girlfriend.

Speaker 8:          01:28:28       I hate when people do that when they talk about people not behaving nicely in prison as if that's a place where that is an option. I saw a guy one time, he was saying that I'm one of those prisons shows. He was talking about how whenever this they're coming into Yoursel, uh, they give you the option where you, you, you put your, you put your back to the door and then they reach it and they handcuff you and he's saying you can't do that. He goes, you're options are basically you back up like a bitch to the door and then all the other inmates look at you like you're a bitch or you fight him.

Speaker 8:          01:29:05       So what, what are you supposed to do? You got you. So you basically have to take a beat down from these fucking officers who address like robocop so that they don't rape you cause your bag just, it's fucking horrific. It's absolutely horrific. And the fact that I've blown off jury duty for the last fucking 16 months, speaking of being racist, that's one that people always say like to get out of jury duty. Like they always just go in there. You just go in there and you just say a bunch of racist shit. I love when people like, they think that that's how you do it. It's like, you know, yeah, war or you could just ignore it when it comes in the mail. You just don't respond to it. You could always do that as opposed to going down to the courthouse and just saying racist shit.

Speaker 8:          01:29:53       You know, you're, you're overthinking it. All right. Where the hell am I? Um, overrated. Uh, American football, even the name is inaccurate. Uh, Mexicans don't play it. Brazilians don't. Argentine teens don't. Hmm. Come Canadians don't play it much. No, they do play it. They have a whole league. You can't, you just too dumbed the name of another country. How about Venezuela? Dumb. Fuck. Um, and here's the crucial bit, nor does the rest of the world. This is a game where the super bowl is played only by American teams, yet they call themselves world champs. Dude, this is one of the oldest arguments I've ever heard. Even the World Cup events of hockey, rugby and rock, paper, scissors. Yes. That's a real event. Invite competitors for more than two nations. Uh, it's one of these few sports who's all American heroes? From Joe Montana to Walter Payton. We're a bunch of guys who only played against their compatriots. Well, you know what? If you pussies want to put together a team and try and join the NFL, I mean, they play a game in London every year trying to get you guys interested in it. You're not interested in the fucking game, and I guarantee whatever fucking team you put together, we'll kick the shit out of you. Just like we have in basketball are fucking sport. You can't

Speaker 8:          01:31:15       the fuck do you get off? Talking about football is a, you know what football is? Football is the correction to soccer. See, Americans were smart enough to realize how goddamn boring you're you're fucking sport is. And you want to talk about a bunch of people diving. I actually, I'm going to take it back. I'm going to actually apologize to the Vancouver Canucks for suggesting that they were diving on an insane level. Okay? Professional soccer players take it to an entirely different level. All right? Every time somebody comes up and barely touches you, you act like he just got thrown out of a fucking car and you sit there with your scarves singing songs cause you're so goddamn board waiting for a fucking goal to be scored. What would happen if you actually pick the Goddamn ball up and ran with it? It'd be exciting. Like rugby. Rugby is exciting as opposed to soccer or football, whatever the fuck you call it, and I know what you're saying like, yeah, but in rugby they're not pussies.

Speaker 8:          01:32:21       They don't wear helmets. Yeah. They don't hit each other as hard either. I've watched it. I've watched both. I think they're both awesome sports to watch. Both of them make me cringe, but the American game is way faster and way more fucking violent. It just is. All right. Our football players are actually dying in their 50s and donating their brains to science and they're finding that they have, this guys have died in their forties that the whatever the fuck they have on their brain, they don't see in the average. They see it basically with people who die of all simers in their eighties okay. People get paralyzed playing our game. All right. If you don't like our game, you know what it is the rest of the world, you know I, this is what I think it is. I just want to thank you big fucking problem with America is, is that you just like a lot of our shit. You like our music. You like our clothes, you like a lot of our culture and it kills you that we don't pay attention to your shit. You want our fucking approval on some goddamn level. Don't roll your fucking eyes at me. You do the fuck. Are you doing listening to this podcast? This is an American podcast, sir.

Speaker 5:          01:33:34       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          01:33:35       What is your fucking, other than our foreign policy, which I totally fucking understand. What is it? You know, because all the shit I just said about soccer, I actually really enjoy the premiere league. I really enjoy that and I just think it's cool that you had to go there and you sing songs and you drink fucking beer with your red fet faces. I think that's a good thing.

Speaker 5:          01:33:54       You know,

Speaker 8:          01:33:57       I actually, I respect the fucking game here. You come over here talking about fucking a, how the fuck is American football? Overrated. You never even said why it was overrated. It is American footballs. Yup. Yeah, but United States is in the Americas. You dumb. Fuck. What are we supposed to call it? Asian football. You know what? You're a God damn. Dummy aren't. Yeah, I on the Dole. Is that what you guys call welfare over there?

Speaker 5:          01:34:26       Uh,

Speaker 8:          01:34:27       what is it? Mexicans don't play. Brazilians don't play it. Our teachers don't. Yeah, they don't. They don't. What? Because they don't play it. We shouldn't play it. And it shouldn't be called American football. Even though we're in America. Explain yourself, sir. Uh, I'm tired of that whole fucking thing. Oh. Then he goes, well, let me digress. It's a great game. If you love commercial breaks. MMM. Well what your fucking game. Your

Speaker 11:         01:34:58       game needs a commercial break. You know what? Do you know what fucking soccer needs? Needs a Goddamn, it needs like a halftime show that's being played the entire time. If you get bored

Speaker 8:          01:35:12       one nil, we're into the penalty time and everybody's sitting there whistling in the crowd. You did something bad here. You got to, yeah.

Speaker 15:         01:35:20       Yellow card. Ooh, he took out the red card.

Speaker 8:          01:35:26       Oh Jesus. A bunch of guys running around in shorts. Um, anyways, advice. Hey, bill loved the podcast. Most guys would probably write in, uh, and how, and ask how to get their girlfriend to do anal. Well, I've got a question that's a little more practical. Um, or girl that I'm seeing absolutely loves anal. Oh, Jesus. Yeah. That, you know something. That's disgusting. All right. I'm just going to say that right off the bat that it's just fucking gross. That's something that for some reason became a big thing in porn for a while. And uh, you know, all I'm going to say is this, I try to keep it clean. Here. You participate in that act long enough, you're going to realize why at some point someday one time you're going to realize why you should never stick pp in there. All right. Without getting gross. Okay. She insist on it every time we have sex. Yeah. The other day after we got back from a road trip that involved way too much gas station food up. Here we go. Here we go. She was having an abnormal amount of gas.

Speaker 8:          01:36:35       All right, I'm going to pause here and give you guys a chance to just kind of walk away from your little recording devices so you don't have to listen to the rest of this. Here we go. Well, she eventually got up off the couch, ran to the bathroom and yelled. I just shit my pants. She was really cool about it. Oh Jesus. I mean, I mean, how cool can you be about it other than just being honest, but she's concerned about the effects of constantly having things shoved up her ass. Yeah. Well she should be. She just turned 30 and has only started doing anal on a consistent spaces for the last few years. Uh, I was wondering if you could, oh, well why are you bringing my girl into this? Get her to invite some of her friends over it and then rambly. Randomly asked her friends, which ones do anal on a consistent basis and whether or not they have problems shitting themselves. Thanks for the help. Uh, yeah, she didn't, I don't know. She didn't shit herself because of the sex you're having. She Shit herself cause you ate it a gas station, I think. Uh, but I can't tell you that. I, I, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah. I Dunno.

Speaker 11:         01:37:51       Okay.

Speaker 8:          01:37:53       You know, I dunno by, yes. I don't know what to tell you. I don't know where to go. I'm not a doctor. I'm not into doing that to a female and a, you know, let's see. Uh, let's see, uh, very soft membrane in there. You're dealing with, you're dealing with the budget issues there, buddy barge a fucking issue. There's no reason to do it. Um, what I would tell her is like, yeah, uh, that's why you shit yourself so you can get out of having to do that to her. Uh, you don't want to do that to the person you love though. Yeah. That's the mother. Your kids someday, uh, cut. Uh, or you know what we're done with that. I think it's about time in this fucking podcast. Let's go with one more of these. Hey, hello bill. I'm 18 years old. I built with my girlfriend for three years and honestly I'm tired of fucking honor.

Speaker 8:          01:38:45       Uh, the relationship is fine. Me and her get along great, but I feel like the excitement and the lust is gone. This is a becoming a problem is making it really difficult not to cheat. I'm guessing at some point you've had the same problem. I just want to know is this going to happen with every longterm relationship? I feel like I'm living the life of a middle aged, married man and are uh, already, but I don't want it to end it as me and her get along fine. Also, I just also just to add, we've recently tried basically every sexually and we've everything sexually and we've easily had sex more than 500 times, so there's no way to really spice things up anymore. Thanks.

Speaker 14:         01:39:31       Uh,

Speaker 8:          01:39:32       yes, I really think you would blow up over here in England. Fewer got your specials on TV over here. You seem to tap into the British humor. The podcast is great, man. Yeah, Dude. You know what, if anybody knows anybody over there and TV, I would love to get my specials on over there. I think I have to do local TV over there. I should probably try and do that. Do a local TV show over there. That's a great fucking idea. Um, what the hell was your question? Um, sir, there is no way to spice it up after you've banged a 500 times. You just better hope that you love her in the end. Sexual happened, uh, less frequent and uh, it's just how it is. It's just how it is. But then, you know, if you really loved this girl and your dumper, you're gonna, you're gonna be sad and be thinking about her as you're banging this new girl who you're going to be excited about fucking probably about 40 times and then you're going to be right back to it.

Speaker 8:          01:40:20       So, uh, that's why they say it's not the be all end all. Um, I don't know what to tell you. You know, I don't know. Why don't you go down the costume store store and dress up like a fucking Milkman? Why don't you start with that? I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what to tell you too. Yeah, it's fucking brutal and happens and happens to everybody. Uh, sorry to end on a fucking Downer there. Ah. Anyways, let's, let's go up. Let's go up here.
