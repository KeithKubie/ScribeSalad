- Oh, hi, guys.
Hi. Hi.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.349
Thank you, yes.
So, um...

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:25.918
I went to junior high school--

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:27.420
I grew up in
the San Fernando Valley,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.121
which is a suburb of here.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.289
- Whoo!
- And--thank you.

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:32.158
In the late '80s, early '90s,

00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:35.160
and it was
a fucking crazy time,

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.496
'cause that's when, uh,
N.W.A. came out

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.966
with "Straight Outta Compton,"
yeah?

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:44.870
And it--that album really, like,
blew the city apart.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.372
Like, they wouldn't let you

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:49.809
wear red or blue
to junior high school

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:53.346
because of all
the seventh grade gangbanging

00:01:53.346 --> 00:01:56.549
that went on, right?

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.451
And people are like,
"Christina,

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.486
have you seen the movie
'Straight Outta Compton'?"

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:03.389
I'm like, "Motherfuckers,
I lived that.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:08.193
Okay?
I ain't gonna go see that. No."

00:02:08.193 --> 00:02:11.130
And also,
around that same time, uh,

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.565
was Rodney King.

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:16.702
Poor Rodney King gets beaten up
by the LAPD in 1991.

00:02:16.702 --> 00:02:20.640
In '92, the four
piece-of-shit cops that beat him

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.309
get acquitted, and--
you're, like, 12 years old.

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.977
Do you even know
what I'm talking about?

00:02:24.977 --> 00:02:26.345
[laughter]

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.480
He got beaten by cops,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.682
and they put the cops on trial,
and they all got acquitted.

00:02:30.682 --> 00:02:33.485
And there was this thing
called the LA riots.

00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:35.154
[whispering]
The LA riots.

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:36.756
And it was so scary.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:39.325
You had to, like, you know,
lock your doors, and--

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.993
well, not me;
I lived in the suburbs.

00:02:40.993 --> 00:02:43.095
But other people did.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:44.931
The point is,
all that shit happens.

00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:49.869
LA is like a hotbed
of racial tension and awfulness.

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:52.505
And it's this exact moment

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.508
that the
LA Unified School District

00:02:55.508 --> 00:03:00.012
decides to embark on
a massive integration program.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:01.347
[laughter]

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.349
I live out in the suburbs

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:08.187
in a super, super white,
like, pretty nice school.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.523
And they decided
to bus in, like,

00:03:10.523 --> 00:03:14.526
violent gangbangers
from downtown.

00:03:14.526 --> 00:03:15.928
From where?
I don't know.

00:03:15.928 --> 00:03:17.931
From fuckin'
the awfullest neighborhoods

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.298
in the world.

00:03:19.298 --> 00:03:21.300
They bused in, like,
black and Mexican--

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.135
and not--not to--

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:24.737
Donald Trump had it some right.

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:28.407
Some of them were nice.

00:03:28.407 --> 00:03:29.642
Some--
[snorts]

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:33.212
Some, I assume,
were nice people.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.983
Not these demon seeds
that were in my school.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:39.218
And don't get me wrong.
I'm all for integration.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:40.720
I'm not, like, a--a bigot.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.421
I just--
I would have preferred

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.123
to have read about it later...

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:46.292
[laughter]

00:03:46.292 --> 00:03:47.459
In a book,

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.961
not, like, live through it.

00:03:48.961 --> 00:03:52.498
'Cause it was really terrible.
It was terrible.

00:03:52.498 --> 00:03:54.834
And the worst part is,
in seventh grade,

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.903
I was hard-core goth.

00:03:56.903 --> 00:03:59.405
[laughter]

00:03:59.405 --> 00:04:02.441
You guys know
what goth kids are, yeah?

00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:05.244
So goth is like...

00:04:05.244 --> 00:04:08.080
Goth is like
all the fun of being dead...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.183
[laughter]

00:04:11.183 --> 00:04:14.320
Except nobody gives a shit.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.788
Nobody cries for you.

00:04:15.788 --> 00:04:19.258
So, like, a goth kid
going to LA public school

00:04:19.258 --> 00:04:20.927
was a lot like a man

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:25.264
wearing a summer dress
and sandals to prison.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:27.433
Oh, shit got real
real quick

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.368
for this white girl.

00:04:29.368 --> 00:04:32.338
Dude, I had one friend
in public school--

00:04:32.338 --> 00:04:34.107
a Mexican girl,

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.942
a chola named Chula.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:37.777
[laughter]

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:42.648
No shit.
We met in remedial reading.

00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:45.518
And we got along
because cholas and goth girls

00:04:45.518 --> 00:04:47.386
have the same makeup.

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:50.122
[laughter]

00:04:50.122 --> 00:04:51.724
[snorts]
And we used to--

00:04:51.724 --> 00:04:53.960
she taught me how to smoke
cigarettes, you know?

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.128
Like, in the bathroom,
we smoked cigarettes.

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:57.363
And she'd talk about oldies.

00:04:57.363 --> 00:05:00.699
For some reason,
cholos love oldies.

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:02.401
"You like that song
'Angel Baby'?"

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:05.904
I'm like, "Fuck no.
Is that The Cure?

00:05:05.904 --> 00:05:09.008
I have no idea
what you're talking about."

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:11.544
But anyways, yeah,
her name was Chula,

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:14.580
and she was always like,
"You know what, Christina?

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.051
Our friendship is like
a blessing in the skies."

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:21.988
[laughter]

00:05:23.922 --> 00:05:25.491
I'm like,
"That's right, girl.

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.494
Way up there."

00:05:28.494 --> 00:05:30.329
So here it is,
seventh grade.

00:05:30.329 --> 00:05:31.764
I'm super, super goth.

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:34.667
I'm in this school
that's newly integrated,

00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:36.269
and it's a nightmare.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:39.772
And here's the thing--
like, I'm a female comic.

00:05:39.772 --> 00:05:42.608
You got to be really,
really fucked up in your head

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.043
to be a female comic,
right?

00:05:44.043 --> 00:05:46.411
It's masochistic.
It's horrible.

00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.247
Everyone hates us.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:50.016
I love it.

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.717
[laughter]

00:05:51.717 --> 00:05:54.954
I love it 'cause
I'm whacked in my head.

00:05:54.954 --> 00:05:56.856
I could have been
a normal white girl.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:06:00.526
I could have had a boyfriend
named Chad or Connor

00:06:00.526 --> 00:06:04.129
or Cooper or Skylar,
some nice football player

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:07.266
who finger-blasted me
behind the racquetball courts.

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:09.735
[laughter]

00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.437
No, dude.
I was different.

00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:12.905
And I think
what changed me--

00:06:12.905 --> 00:06:15.140
you know, you have, like,
one thing in your life

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.308
that happens to you, and...

00:06:16.308 --> 00:06:17.376
[clicks tongue]
Ah-ah!

00:06:17.376 --> 00:06:18.878
It just kind of...

00:06:18.878 --> 00:06:21.547
[laughter]

00:06:21.547 --> 00:06:23.882
I got into a fight.

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:28.554
And I got into a fight
with a black girl.

00:06:28.554 --> 00:06:30.222
[imitates record scratching]
Right.

00:06:30.222 --> 00:06:32.091
Look how weird
you fuckers got.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:33.559
Yeah.

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:37.997
I'm not saying
that all black girls

00:06:37.997 --> 00:06:41.734
are amazing boxers,
because that...

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:45.404
[laughter]

00:06:45.404 --> 00:06:48.740
That would be a stereotype,
you guys.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.111
A stereotype
that is completely fucking true.

00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.445
[laughs and snorts]

00:06:53.445 --> 00:06:54.780
That's what's up.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.982
MMA does not have shit
on a black girl.

00:06:56.982 --> 00:06:59.151
They will fuck you up.

00:06:59.151 --> 00:07:01.653
Even little black--
12-year-old black girls,

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:03.456
I see them doing
double Dutch in the street;

00:07:03.456 --> 00:07:07.592
I get the fuck
across the street.

00:07:07.592 --> 00:07:09.962
No way, dude.
No way.

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.830
Now, the girl
that messed with me,

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.100
her name was Rosina Johnson.

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:16.435
What?

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:19.772
Yes, that's that bitch's
real name.

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:24.476
Let her come find me now.

00:07:24.476 --> 00:07:27.180
So what happened is,
Rosina and I...

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.447
Do you buy that?

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:30.349
That I'm super-street?
I am.

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.351
So Rosina and I
had PE together.

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:34.019
That's physical education,

00:07:34.019 --> 00:07:37.990
something children don't have
anymore today, right?

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.993
And, uh, we would change
in the locker rooms, right?

00:07:40.993 --> 00:07:42.894
And this girl
would fuck with me.

00:07:42.894 --> 00:07:44.463
Like, she would mess with me,

00:07:44.463 --> 00:07:47.466
but she did it by, like,
singing songs at me.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:48.801
Like, first,
it started with her

00:07:48.801 --> 00:07:50.570
just calling me
"Beetlejuice."

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.638
She'd be like--

00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:56.642
Remember, like,
that stupid movie?

00:07:56.642 --> 00:07:58.310
"Hey, Beetlejuice,
Beetlejuice!

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:00.513
"Oh, shit, I see Beetlejuice
is coming up over here.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:03.015
"Beetlejuice!

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:04.750
Oh, damn,
she look like she Beetle--"

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.653
I'm like, "Yeah, I know.
I got it."

00:08:07.653 --> 00:08:10.222
But then one day,
after PE,

00:08:10.222 --> 00:08:12.691
they fucking--they used to sell
pickles for some reason.

00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:16.194
Like, you went to public school
in LA,

00:08:16.194 --> 00:08:20.032
after PE, they would sell you
the unhealthiest crap.

00:08:20.032 --> 00:08:24.169
It was, like, rock candy,
Now &amp; Laters, and then pickles.

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:26.539
I remember this bitch--
this bitch stole my pickle too.

00:08:26.539 --> 00:08:28.874
One day, she just took
my pickle.

00:08:28.874 --> 00:08:32.278
But what broke
the goth girl's back...

00:08:32.278 --> 00:08:35.948
[snorts]
Was...

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.850
she was singing at me
one day,

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:39.718
and I can't--I can't sing
what she sang

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:42.721
for legal reasons,
but--I don't know.

00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:46.125
What's a popular R&amp;B--
it's, like--

00:08:46.125 --> 00:08:47.926
[vocalizing and scatting]

00:08:47.926 --> 00:08:51.096
♪ Kiss my pussy 
And...

00:08:51.096 --> 00:08:52.698
♪ Why don't I fart
in your face? ♪

00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:54.200
♪ Fart in your face, girl 

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.401
♪ You know you love
sandwiches in my ass ♪

00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:59.438
I don't know.
So...

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.907
That was the song
she sang at me.

00:09:01.907 --> 00:09:03.542
♪ Kiss my pussy,
kiss my pussy ♪

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.411
♪ Kiss my pu-- 
And she would repeat it.

00:09:05.411 --> 00:09:07.479
And I couldn't take it anymore.
You know what I'm saying?

00:09:07.479 --> 00:09:09.147
I couldn't take it anymore.

00:09:09.147 --> 00:09:11.716
You can poke the little doggie
so much,

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:13.986
and the dog's gonna bite back.

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:17.255
And I turn, and I stop
in the middle of her singing,

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:19.291
and I say to her,

00:09:19.291 --> 00:09:22.060
I go, "Why don't you...

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.563
shut the fuck up?"

00:09:24.563 --> 00:09:28.901
[laughter]

00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:32.671
Oh, you guys think
that was a good idea?

00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:35.107
Oh, hey,
should I try heroin?

00:09:35.107 --> 00:09:36.776
[laughter]

00:09:36.776 --> 00:09:39.144
Yeah, I hear
nothing bad happens.

00:09:39.144 --> 00:09:42.081
[laughter]

00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:46.619
Dude, this girl
was a powerful fighter.

00:09:46.619 --> 00:09:48.153
I'm gonna break it down
for you.

00:09:48.153 --> 00:09:51.490
So first of all,
very physically intimidating.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:54.860
She had, like, upper body--
like Michelle Obama arms.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.429
I don't know
if you've ever seen her

00:09:57.429 --> 00:09:58.931
in those strapless dresses.

00:09:58.931 --> 00:10:00.599
And she would come at me,
dude.

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.668
She came at me with--
with windmills.

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:06.172
Just bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! Bam!

00:10:06.172 --> 00:10:09.274
Yeah, see, you were laughing
'cause you know that move.

00:10:09.274 --> 00:10:13.011
Go to worldstarhiphop.com.
You know it's real.

00:10:13.011 --> 00:10:15.447
Wham!

00:10:15.447 --> 00:10:21.353
Not only that, this girl
was a psychological warrior.

00:10:21.353 --> 00:10:23.956
She got inside of my head.

00:10:23.956 --> 00:10:27.693
And she did this
by repeating things.

00:10:27.693 --> 00:10:30.529
She would just get in my face
and just,

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:33.666
"Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:35.734
"Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:10:35.734 --> 00:10:40.639
"Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:10:40.639 --> 00:10:45.677
"Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no! Oh, no!

00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:48.814
Oh, no! Oh, no!
Oh, no!"

00:10:52.851 --> 00:10:55.187
"Un-uh, you don't know me!
You don't know me!

00:10:55.187 --> 00:10:56.856
"You don't know me!
You don't know me!

00:10:56.856 --> 00:10:58.491 line:91%
"You don't know me!
You don't know me!

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:00.326
"You don't know me.
You don't know me.

00:11:00.326 --> 00:11:02.161 line:91%
"You don't know me.
You don't know me.

00:11:02.161 --> 00:11:03.995
"You don't know me.
You don't know me.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:06.198
You don't know me.
You don't--"

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:09.668
Like, "Yes, bitch.
I don't know you.

00:11:09.668 --> 00:11:13.572
Just stop hitting me."

00:11:13.572 --> 00:11:16.374
Oh, my God.

00:11:16.374 --> 00:11:19.945
Having flashbacks.

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:22.548
And just a word of advice,

00:11:22.548 --> 00:11:24.850
during a fight,

00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:26.518
if someone
asks you questions,

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:30.389
do not answer the questions...

00:11:30.389 --> 00:11:32.024
they ask.

00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:36.428
Those are rhetorical.
Those are not for you.

00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:40.099
She was like,
"Oh, you think you cute?"

00:11:40.099 --> 00:11:42.935
I'm like, "I don't--I don't--
I guess I'm okay.

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:46.038
I'm not, like, a model.
[chuckles]"

00:11:46.038 --> 00:11:49.575
"Well, somebody's about
to get fucked up."

00:11:49.575 --> 00:11:53.212
"Is that somebody me?"

00:11:53.212 --> 00:11:54.880
Ugh, so stupid.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.316
It was the dumbest decision
of my life.

00:11:57.316 --> 00:11:59.485
It was,
because the biggest comeback

00:11:59.485 --> 00:12:02.054
I had in seventh grade--
this is my biggest comeback.

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:04.556
"So?"
That's all I had.

00:12:04.556 --> 00:12:07.126
[laughter]

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:09.828
Dude, Rosina Johnson
would come at me with, like,

00:12:09.828 --> 00:12:14.633
haikus, fables, stories,
rhymes.

00:12:16.902 --> 00:12:22.074
This girl would have me
choked out up against a locker.

00:12:22.074 --> 00:12:25.110
Like, she choked me out
at one point in this fight--

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.413
choked me out,
and in the middle of that,

00:12:28.413 --> 00:12:32.751
stopped to bust a rhyme.

00:12:32.751 --> 00:12:35.420
This is the exact rhyme
this girl spit

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:36.755
from seventh grade

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:38.089
from this ass-beating
I got from her.

00:12:38.089 --> 00:12:39.525
I gonna sing it
for you now.

00:12:39.525 --> 00:12:41.159
Here we go.
It was...

00:12:41.159 --> 00:12:43.162
[chuckles and snorts]
It was, um...

00:12:43.162 --> 00:12:45.964
♪ Talk to the hand,
it's yo' breath I can't stand ♪

00:12:45.964 --> 00:12:48.000
♪ I don't mean to be mean,
but you need LISTERINE ♪

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.370
♪ Not a sip, not a swallow,
but the whole damn bottle ♪

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.639
[laughter and applause]

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:57.309
Right.
Wow.

00:12:57.309 --> 00:13:00.278
[chuckles]

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:02.281
You know how hard it is
to get punched in the stomach

00:13:02.281 --> 00:13:04.183
and laugh at the same time?
Like...

00:13:04.183 --> 00:13:08.987
[chuckles]
"You're a genius.

00:13:08.987 --> 00:13:10.522
Oh, you're so funny."

00:13:10.522 --> 00:13:12.157
It was--it was hard.

00:13:12.157 --> 00:13:13.959
And here's the thing,

00:13:13.959 --> 00:13:15.227
I stood up for myself.

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:18.464
I pushed back
on Rosina Johnson.

00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:20.799
I pushed back.

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:23.902
Yes, I got my ass kicked,
but...

00:13:23.902 --> 00:13:26.906
at the end of the year
after all of that,

00:13:26.906 --> 00:13:28.540
we were okay.

00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:31.210
A weird thing happened.
Like, we were cool.

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.011
I'm not saying this bitch
was in my wedding,

00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:34.379
but I'm saying, like...

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:35.714
[laughter]

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:39.351
Oh, it's not like that,
but...

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:41.319
we were okay.

00:13:41.319 --> 00:13:43.822
And at the end of the year--
true story--

00:13:43.822 --> 00:13:45.557
at the end of the year,

00:13:45.557 --> 00:13:48.694
she even signed
my yearbook.

00:13:48.694 --> 00:13:51.997
Yeah, she wrote,
"Dear Christina,

00:13:51.997 --> 00:13:53.665
"you're a nice girl.

00:13:53.665 --> 00:13:55.400
"Stay sweet.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.170
Love, Rosina Johnson."

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.707
[applause]
Yeah.

00:14:01.707 --> 00:14:04.176
That's right.

00:14:04.176 --> 00:14:06.779
That's right,
so the moral of the story is,

00:14:06.779 --> 00:14:09.281
sometimes
violence is the answer.

00:14:09.281 --> 00:14:10.882
[laughter]

00:14:10.882 --> 00:14:13.685
