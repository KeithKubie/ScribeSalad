CHRIS DIBONA: Please mute your
phones for the spectacular

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:08.970
event that is forthcoming.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.085
You should do that, too.

00:00:10.085 --> 00:00:10.935
NEIL GAIMAN: Yeah, OK.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:11.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.726
CHRIS DIBONA: It's
a BlackBerry.

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:16.970
That was a Google, sort of
Android joke, there.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.010
CHRIS DIBONA: Have I not given
you enough Androids?

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.590
NEIL GAIMAN: You've
given me wonderful

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:23.830
Androids in the past.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.140
CHRIS DIBONA: You can
still have them.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.450
You want a Nexus 10?

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:27.330
You know, I can--

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.770
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.320
CHRIS DIBONA: You know,
I've got one.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.310
I'll have one brought over.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.640
NEIL GAIMAN: Let me talk about
the advantages of the

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.513
BlackBerry when it comes
to social media.

00:00:34.513 --> 00:00:35.986
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:35.986 --> 00:00:37.715
NEIL GAIMAN: Also, the flicking
things around with

00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:38.240
your thumb.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.290
I actually like flicking.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.790
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah,
it's flicky.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.342
NEIL GAIMAN: I like that.

00:00:41.342 --> 00:00:45.170
CHRIS DIBONA: So as you know,
Neil came up from Los Angeles

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.020
was your last stop?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.820
NEIL GAIMAN: It was, last
night we finished--

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.640
I say "we," because there's a
well-oiled machine on either

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.890
side of me, pushing books on one
side and putting pens in

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.990
and out of my hands
in the other--

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.530
and we wrapped at about quarter

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:01.370
to 3:00 in the morning.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.019
CHRIS DIBONA: Wow.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.730
Is that in Los Angeles
time zone?

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.240
It's a little different there.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.725
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:10.601
NEIL GAIMAN: How far
away are you?

00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:11.560
CHRIS DIBONA: Me personally?

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.610
No, OK.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.350
So, long bus trip, magical,
through the Coalinga's smell.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.070
Or did you take 101?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.980
NEIL GAIMAN: I slept.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.065
I don't know where
the bus drivers--

00:01:21.065 --> 00:01:22.190
there are two of them.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:29.300
Their names are Charlie and
Paul, and somehow you get in

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.240
the bus, you fall asleep, you
wake up in the next place.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.910
CHRIS DIBONA: It's like
teleportation.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.470
NEIL GAIMAN: Its magic.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.520
I think they just roll the world
under the bus wheels.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.410
The bus stays completely
still.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.810
CHRIS DIBONA: Maybe the bus
stays the same, everything

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.630
changes around it.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.830
So I'm going to let you do your
reading, and then we'll--

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.890
NEIL GAIMAN: Tell
them who I am.

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:50.665
They don't know.

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:51.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.335
NEIL GAIMAN: They're
all sitting here

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:53.560
going who is this person?

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.335
Why are we doing this?

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:55.850
CHRIS DIBONA: I'm sorry.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.800
I'd like to introduce
Dan Brown.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.170
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.110
CHRIS DIBONA: I was told the
number one New York Times best

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.800
selling author would be on
stage, and I just assumed--

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.730
oh no, it's you this
week, right?

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.700
Yeah, OK.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.997
So, congratulations.

00:02:14.997 --> 00:02:20.601
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:21.900
CHRIS DIBONA: It's you, Miss.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.150
Evanovich.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.970
It's Neil Gaiman, as you know.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.130
CHRIS DIBONA: Not really
Janet Evanovich

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.490
NEIL GAIMAN: Half the dozen
people [? walking. ?]

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.670
CHRIS DIBONA: Or the one
who does the "Z As In

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.570
Zebra" crime novels.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.970
She's wrapping it up, too.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.100
I'm sure she'll be number one
at some point, right?

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.060
Not Sookie Stackhouse,
but the other one?

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.625
NEIL GAIMAN: Dying
here, Chris.

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:48.776
Dying on stage.

00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:50.800
CHRIS DIBONA: They're not
here to listen to me!

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.460
They here to listen to you.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.730
So we should let you--

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.960
you had something you
wanted to read from.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.120
NEIL GAIMAN: I have a
couple of things I

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.470
want to read to them.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:01.440
I have a plan, a secret,
sort of weird plan.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.930
So, plan.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.920
I'll do a little reading, and
then last time I came in and

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.480
did a Google Talk, and the time
I came in before that, I

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.880
actually got up and just burbled
for a long time, and

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.330
then to questions.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.600
Let us assume no burblage.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.620
We will go straight
to questions.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.670
There's a lot of you.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.950
We'll do a bunch of questions,
and then I will read something

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.620
else that won't be out for a
while, so you get a sort of

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.680
sneak Googly preview.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.810
So that's the plan.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.660
CHRIS DIBONA: OK.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.270
You're being recorded.

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.990
You're OK with that?

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.780
NEIL GAIMAN: What!

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.350
CHRIS DIBONA: Because I
don't want to ruin the

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.232
surprise of a book.

00:03:44.232 --> 00:03:46.300
NEIL GAIMAN: Actually,
the last time I did

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.912
one of these, I was--

00:03:48.912 --> 00:03:51.201
CHRIS DIBONA: A younger man.

00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:53.790
NEIL GAIMAN: Younger,
significantly more beautiful,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.280
definitely less gray.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.330
And in a terrible, terribly
weird mood, because as I was

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.920
coming in through that door, I
got the email saying, your cat

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.376
just bit a kid and that is going
to have to be put down.

00:04:06.376 --> 00:04:07.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.820
NEIL GAIMAN: Oh, not my cat!

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.450
CHRIS DIBONA: I didn't think a
puma was a good choice for a

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.725
domestic animal.

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.620
NEIL GAIMAN: Just large,
black, and evil.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.839
And actually, having
nine lives, he

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.940
escaped that, that doom.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.840
So it's nice to be here at
Google, in the same place

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.630
without worrying about
cat death.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.270
Hello.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.000
Go and sit down or something.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.800
CHRIS DIBONA: Yeah, I'm going
to get out of the way.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.520
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.390
NEIL GAIMAN: Right.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.340
So for any of you who do
not know who I am, my

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.820
name is Neil Gaiman.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:42.990
I'm a writer.

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.620
I started out writing comics.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.820
Actually, no, I started
before that.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.230
I was a journalist, and then I
wrote comic books back when

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.540
they were still comic
books, before we

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.470
called the graphic novels.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.070
And then I started writing book
books, and somewhere in

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.950
there, I made some television,
and some films,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.200
and children's books.

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.460
Probably the most fun I've had
on this signing tour that I'm

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.210
on so far, which is my last
signing tour, is counting the

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.460
number of licensed,
as opposed to

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.290
unlicensed, Doctor Who t-shirts.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.646
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:22.646 --> 00:05:28.350
NEIL GAIMAN: It's currently
running at 4,000 to 6.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.190
I was amazed to see a licensed
t-shirt last

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.440
night in Los Angeles.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.400
So, I wrote a couple of episodes
of "Doctor Who," and

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.890
most recently, I wrote
a novel accidentally.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.820
And that's this.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.820
And it's called "The Ocean at
the End of the Lane," and

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.830
right now, it's at number one
on the "New York Times"

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.570
bestseller list.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.550
And it's getting me the best
reviews of my life, which has

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.440
not been a life entirely
devoid of good reviews.

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.100
But I've never seen anything
like this.

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:18.720
And the book is completely
and utterly accidental.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:29.420
It began about 18 months ago
when my wife, Amanda, who is a

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:33.870
musician and performer, went off
to Melbourne, Australia,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.120
to make an album.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.920
And I missed her.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.480
And I discovered that if you
have a wife who's making an

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.170
album, she doesn't have
much attention for

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.090
anything else in the world.

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.080
I would get a daily text saying,
"I love you, making an

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.590
album."

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:59.250
And as far as she was concerned,
that was it.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.300
She was doing her duty.

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.790
And as far as I was concerned,
it was I miss you, where did

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.060
you go, I had a wife, I had a
girlfriend before that, I had

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:06.050
a fiance before that.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:07.670
Before that I had a girlfriend,
and now I have

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.575
somebody making an album.

00:07:09.575 --> 00:07:11.630
NEIL GAIMAN: And I
thought, right, I

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:15.420
will write her something.

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:22.830
And the idea of essentially sort
of sending her a short

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:26.720
story was one that seemed
like a really good idea.

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.520
She's not actually--

00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:41.440
this may seem strange because I
am probably best known as a

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.530
writer of the fantastic--

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:47.550
but my wife doesn't really
like fantasy very much.

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.170
So I thought, well, OK, I can
dial down the fantasy, and

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:53.160
I'll put in things she likes.

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.506
And she likes me.

00:07:54.506 --> 00:07:56.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.370
NEIL GAIMAN: So I'll put
some me in there.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:05.252
And she likes honesty, and
she likes feelings.

00:08:05.252 --> 00:08:09.460
And I don't normally do
feelings, because I'm male.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.332
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:11.332 --> 00:08:12.460
NEIL GAIMAN: And English.

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:14.132 --> 00:08:17.110
NEIL GAIMAN: A killer
combination.

00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.290
But I thought, OK, I'll do a
short story, and it'll have

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:22.120
that stuff.

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.820
And I'll set it--

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:28.250
it won't quite be my family,
and it won't actually be

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:30.700
autobiographical, but the kid,
the viewpoint character, is

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.320
going to be very much me.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.090
And I will have some fun with
this, and I'll write her a

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:37.539
short story.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:42.200
And after a few weeks, I went,
you know, I'm really not

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.904
writing a short story here.

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:47.810
I'm probably writing
a novelette.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:52.000
There are about sort of 10,000
to 18,000 words, maybe 10,000

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.570
to 14,000 words, something
like that.

00:08:55.570 --> 00:08:59.420
And then I thought, OK, well,
a week or so later, I'm

00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:00.910
obviously writing a novella.

00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:09.660
And I wrote an email to my
editors, and I said I'm

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.430
writing a novella.

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:12.160
Don't really know what we'll
do with it, but there is a

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.550
novella happening.

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:17.640
And my plan had originally been
to finish the thing and

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:22.210
send it to Amanda in Melbourne,
but she finished

00:09:22.210 --> 00:09:23.370
making her album.

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:27.070
And she came back to America,
and she went to Dallas to mix

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:30.360
the album, so I went to
Dallas to be with her.

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:33.360
And every day she'd mix her
album, and every day I would

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.780
go to a local coffee shop, and
I finished writing my book on

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.380
the first day, and then
I started typing.

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.000
And I typed it out.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.270
Every night, I'd
read it to her.

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.020
And every morning, I'd say, OK,
where do you remember up

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.140
to before you fell asleep?

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:55.130
And she'd tell me, and
I'd read it again.

00:09:55.130 --> 00:10:00.200
And when I finished, I did
a would count, because

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:03.490
technology allows you to do that
these days very simply.

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:08.770
And sent a very surprised email,
slightly apologetic

00:10:08.770 --> 00:10:12.620
email, to my editors on each
side of the Atlantic saying I

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.970
appear to have accidentally
written a novel.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:16.856
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.856 --> 00:10:18.532
NEIL GAIMAN: I'm very sorry.

00:10:18.532 --> 00:10:20.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:21.890
NEIL GAIMAN: And I'd never
written a novel that hadn't

00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.480
been planned before.

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.130
I'd always known that I was
writing something, and I knew

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:26.245
that it was happening.

00:10:26.245 --> 00:10:30.950
And here I was with
an extra book.

00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:36.640
And didn't actually think that
it was anything other than

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:43.300
this weird, kind of very
personal book.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.680
I'd written things over the
years, mostly short stores, a

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:48.980
few graphic novels--

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.570
"Violent Cases," "Mr. Punch"
were both graphic novels--

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.410
a few short stories, which would
all be these kind of

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.040
peculiar, not really
autobiographical stories, but

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:07.310
using big, chunky
autobiographical elements.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:15.660
And generally speaking, they got
nice critical response and

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.350
sank without trace, were never
really heard of again.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.220
And suddenly I'd written
something, and I'd send it out

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.900
to friends to read and give
me their reactions.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:27.680
And they'd email back saying
it's the best thing you've

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.030
written, and I cried.

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.760
And I go, OK, it must
be the feelings.

00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.954
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:35.954 --> 00:11:39.920
NEIL GAIMAN: So, I'm going to
read you just a little bit of

00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.580
this, because I know we have
limited time, and Chris and I

00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:47.350
took up most of it doing
possibly the worst comedy

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.890
routine ever seen in this
entire building.

00:12:02.852 --> 00:12:06.830
"Nobody came to my seventh
birthday party.

00:12:06.830 --> 00:12:09.490
There was a table laid with
jellies and trifles with a

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:12.370
party hat beside each place and
a birthday cake with seven

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:15.120
candles on it in the center
of the table.

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.750
The cake had a book drawn
on it in icing.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.120
My mother, who had organized
the party, told me that the

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.790
lady at the bakery said they'd
never put a book on a birthday

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:26.630
cake before, and that mostly for
boys, it was footballs or

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:27.740
spaceships.

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.530
I was their first book.

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.820
When it became obvious that
nobody was coming, my mother

00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:37.510
lit the seven candles on the
cake, and I blew them out.

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.500
I ate a slice of the cake, as
did my little sister and one

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:43.350
of her friends, both of them
attending the party as

00:12:43.350 --> 00:12:48.070
observers, not participants,
before they fled, giggling, to

00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.400
the garden.

00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.270
Party games had been prepared
by my mother, but because

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:55.960
nobody was there, not even my
sister, none of the party

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.740
games were played.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.830
And I unwrapped the newspaper
around the [? past ?] the

00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:04.690
parcel gift myself, revealing a
blue plastic Batman figure.

00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:08.230
I was sad that nobody had come
to my party, but happy that I

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.570
had a Batman figure, and there
was a birthday present waiting

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:13.930
to be read, a boxed set
of the Narnia books,

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:15.870
which I took upstairs.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:19.930
I lay on the bed and lost
myself in the stories.

00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:21.540
I liked that.

00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.370
Books were safer than other
people, anyway.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.980
My parents had also given me a
"Best of Gilbert and Sullivan"

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.310
LP to add to the two
that I already had.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.760
I'd loved Gilbert and Sullivan
since I was three when my

00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:36.860
father's younger sister,
my aunt, took me to see

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.780
"Iolanthe" play filled with
loads and fairies.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.280
I found the existence in nature
of the fairies easier

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:46.880
to understand than that
of the lords.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.720
My aunt had died soon after of
pneumonia in the hospital.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.250
That evening, my father arrived
home from work, and he

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:57.640
brought a cardboard
box with him.

00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.080
In the cardboard box was a
soft-haired, black kitten of

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.140
uncertain gender whom I
immediately named Fluffy and

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.400
which I loved utterly
and wholeheartedly.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.490
Fluffy slept on my
bed at night.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:12.760
I talked to it sometimes when
my little sister was not

00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.610
around, half expecting it to
answer in a human tongue.

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:17.300
It never did.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.390
I did not mind.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:20.930
The kitten was affectionate,
and interested, and a good

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.690
companion for someone who's
seventh birthday party had

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:26.740
consisted of a table with iced
biscuits and a blancmange and

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.260
cake and 15 folding chairs.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.820
I do not remember ever asking
any of the other children in

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:37.280
my class at school why they'd
not come to my party.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.560
I did not need to ask them.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.760
They were not my friends,
after all.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:43.430
They were just the people
I went to school with.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:46.730
I made friends slowly
when I made them.

00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:48.730
I had books, and now
I had my kitten.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:51.160
We would be Dick Whittington
and his cat, I knew.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.530
Of if Fluffy proved particularly
intelligent, we

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.580
would be the Miller's son
and Puss in Boots.

00:14:56.580 --> 00:14:59.300
The kitten slept on my pillow,
and it even waited for me to

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.960
come home from school sitting on
the driveway in front of my

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:05.470
house by the fence, until a
month later it was run over

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.960
the taxi that brought the opal
miner to stay at my house.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.770
I was not there when
it happened.

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:13.920
I got home from school that
day, and my kitten was not

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:14.960
waiting to meet me.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.775
In the kitchen was a tall, rangy
man with tanned skin and

00:15:17.775 --> 00:15:19.120
a checked shirt.

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:21.560
He was drinking coffee
at the kitchen table.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.050
I could smell it.

00:15:23.050 --> 00:15:25.830
In those days all coffee was
instant coffee, a bitter, dark

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:28.682
brown powder that came
out of a jar.

00:15:28.682 --> 00:15:31.690
'I'm afraid I had a little
accident arriving here,' he

00:15:31.690 --> 00:15:32.610
told me cheerfully.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:36.510
'But not to worry.' His accent
was clicked, unfamiliar.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.460
It was the first South African
accent I'd had.

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.496
He too had a cardboard box on
the table in front of him.

00:15:42.496 --> 00:15:46.220
'The black kitten, was
he yours?' he asked.

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.660
'It's called Fluffy,' I said.

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.410
'Yeah, like I said, accident
coming here.

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.940
Not to worry, disposed
of the corpse.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.230
Don't have to trouble
yourself.

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:54.860
Dealt with the matter.

00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:56.600
Open the box.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.250
'What?'

00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:00.100
He pointed to the box.

00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.296
'Open it,' he said.

00:16:02.296 --> 00:16:04.690
The opal miner was a tall man.

00:16:04.690 --> 00:16:07.100
He wore jeans and checked shirts
every time I saw him

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.090
except the last.

00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:11.080
He had a thick chain of pale
gold around his neck.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.280
That was gone the last
time I saw him, too.

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.250
I did not want to
open his box.

00:16:16.250 --> 00:16:17.440
I wanted to go off on my own.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.020
I wanted to cry for my kitten,
but I could not do that if

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:22.220
anyone else was there
and watching me.

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.580
I wanted to mourn.

00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:26.170
I wanted to bury my friend at
the bottom of the garden, past

00:16:26.170 --> 00:16:28.890
the green grass fairy ring into
the rhododendron bush

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:32.110
cave, back past the heap of
grass cuttings where nobody

00:16:32.110 --> 00:16:34.550
ever went but me.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.550
The box moved.

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.660
'Bought it for you,"
said the man.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.390
'Always pay my debts."

00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.160
I reached out, lifted the top
flap of the box, wondering if

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.870
this was a joke, if my kitten
would be in there.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:50.300
Instead a ginger face stared
up at me truculently.

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:55.100
The opal miner took the
cat out of the box.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:58.942
He was a huge, ginger-striped
tomcat missing half an ear.

00:16:58.942 --> 00:17:01.070
He glared at me angrily.

00:17:01.070 --> 00:17:04.190
This cat had not liked
being put in a box.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.560
He was not used to boxes.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:09.280
I reached out to stroke his head
feeling unfaithful to the

00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:11.869
memory of my kitten, but he
pulled back so I could not

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:14.470
touch him, and he hissed at me,
then stalked off to a far

00:17:14.470 --> 00:17:19.986
corner of the room where he sat,
and looked, and hated.

00:17:19.986 --> 00:17:24.140
'There you go, cat for a cat,"
said the opal miner, and he

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:26.430
ruffled my hair with
his leathery hand.

00:17:26.430 --> 00:17:28.339
Then he walked out into the
hall, leaving me in the

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:32.110
kitchen with a cat that
was not my kitten.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.011
The man put his head back
through the door.

00:17:35.011 --> 00:17:39.050
'He's called Monster,'
he said.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.370
It felt like a bad joke.

00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:45.890
I propped open the kitchen door
so the cat could get out,

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:47.970
then I went up to the bedroom,
and lay on my bed, and cried

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:49.860
for dead Fluffy.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.990
When my parents got home that
evening, I do not think my

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:53.290
kitten was

00:17:53.290 --> 00:18:03.417
even mentioned." [APPLAUSE]

00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:05.610
CHRIS DIBONA: So now you wanted
to take some questions?

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:06.800
NEIL GAIMAN: Yeah, why not?

00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.300
CHRIS DIBONA: So I'm going to
quote Thomas Stoppard--

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:12.300
NEIL GAIMAN: Actually, before we
do, just I would say after

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:14.990
that, things get
much stranger.

00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.520
There we go.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.140
Now.

00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:18.970
CHRIS DIBONA: I'm going to quote
Tom Stoppard quoting

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:24.170
Neil Gaiman, with some
liberties. "A question is a

00:18:24.170 --> 00:18:28.051
short interrogative that can
be answered by its victim."

00:18:28.051 --> 00:18:31.710
Although he didn't say "victim."
The point is often

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:33.920
people give speeches
here at Google.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.070
NEIL GAIMAN: Nobody at
Google would do that.

00:18:36.070 --> 00:18:37.380
CHRIS DIBONA: This is
what I told him.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.840
So if you have a question,
there's a

00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:40.200
microphone right there.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.950
Feel free to use it.

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:43.560
I can't believe there's
no questions.

00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:44.410
Here we go.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.465
All right, now I'm going
to fade away.

00:18:48.465 --> 00:18:49.670
NEIL GAIMAN: Whop
was that man?

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.380
Where did he come from?

00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:51.470
Where has he gone?

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.790
Hello.

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:52.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.180
So, I'm just curious if there
are any random moments from

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.750
your childhood that have stuck
with you all your life, that

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:03.683
pervade everything you write?

00:19:03.683 --> 00:19:05.530
NEIL GAIMAN: You know,
there really aren't.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:09.270
I mean, strategy the driving
force-- although I was

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:14.250
absolutely willing to pillage
and ransack my childhood

00:19:14.250 --> 00:19:17.870
mostly for the moments of
corroborative detail.

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:20.490
The process of writing a novel,
the process of writing

00:19:20.490 --> 00:19:25.390
fiction, is really the same
process that you use to

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:27.460
convince a teacher that the
dog really did eat your

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:31.530
homework, and you need to
get the color of the

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.790
dog right and stuff.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:37.940
So for corroborative detail, I
would absolutely go and raid

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:46.000
and pillage my childhood, but
the story itself actually

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.150
began much more with fictional
things from my childhood.

00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:54.140
One of the things that drives
the book is a family called

00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:57.900
the Hempstocks, who are as far
as we can tell pretty much

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:01.860
immortal and have been living
in the farm at the end of my

00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:04.450
lane for thousands
upon thousands of

00:20:04.450 --> 00:20:05.500
years, if not millions.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.000
I mean, the youngest of them,
who is 11 but has obviously

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:16.670
been 11 for a very, very, very
long time, claims that the

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:19.340
duck pond in her garden is
actually the ocean, and they

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.980
came across that ocean
from the old country.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.550
And her mother says that she's
wrong, and actually the old

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:27.600
country sank.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.030
And then old Mrs. Hampstock,
who claims to be able to

00:20:31.030 --> 00:20:34.225
remember the Big Bang, says
they're both wrong, and

00:20:34.225 --> 00:20:35.890
actually the old country
blow up.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.850
AUDIENCE: When you were writing
"Sandman," did you

00:20:41.850 --> 00:20:45.240
have a real view of the overall
story structure and

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.250
where the plot was going from
the beginning, or did it

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:51.170
really evolve substantially
over time?

00:20:51.170 --> 00:21:00.150
NEIL GAIMAN: When I was doing
"Sandman," I had an idea of a

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:03.180
shape from the very beginning,
but I didn't actually think I

00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:07.690
was going to be allowed
to do that shape.

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.910
What I thought was going to
happen, because in those days

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.530
there was a sort of
weird matter of

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.890
honor from comics companies.

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.110
They tended to do 12 issues, a
year's run of a comic, and

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:24.170
then cancel it if it wasn't
really selling anything.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:28.310
And I expected that what I was
doing here was going to be a

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:33.160
minor critical hit and a major
commercial disaster.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:40.320
So I plotted an eight-issue
storyline because I knew that

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.580
issue eight is when they'd
phone you up and say, OK,

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:47.420
you're not selling anything,
and we're canceling it, and

00:21:47.420 --> 00:21:50.420
you've got to wrap it up.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.630
And we're going to 12 issues,
and then we're done.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.680
So I thought, OK, it'll be eight
issues, and then I'll do

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.970
four short stories,
and we'll be done.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:01.180
And even though I sort of sowed
the seeds for stuff that

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:04.910
I planned to do if it kept
going, that was what I thought

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:05.960
was going to happen.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.190
Except by issue eight, it was
obvious that we were selling

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.350
more than anything like
that had ever sold.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:14.450
We weren't actually selling
"X-Men" or "Batman" or

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:15.930
"Superman" numbers or anything,
but we were

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:22.770
outselling any comparable for
mature readers thing.

00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.510
And at that point, I actually
went, OK, now if I do this, I

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.270
can do this thing.

00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:35.050
And I took the plot, was pretty
sure that by issue 40

00:22:35.050 --> 00:22:39.540
it would all be done, and
went off and did it.

00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:42.430
And of course, it all took twice
as long as I thought,

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:46.270
and after a while I was saying,
well, it'll probably

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.560
wrap up at issue 50,
and then issue 60.

00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.450
And then I started saying
if I ever get to

00:22:50.450 --> 00:22:53.760
issue 75, I'll be surprised.

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.530
And then I managed to finish
it at episode 75.

00:22:57.530 --> 00:23:01.490
And it's not that I knew
everything, but I knew the

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.140
shape of the story.

00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:11.230
And I also knew because you're
writing serial fiction, you

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:14.000
don't have to know everything.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.870
You have to have room
for happy accidents.

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:20.700
You have to have room to do
something, and then go, oh my

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.860
gosh, that character is great,
and bring them back.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:27.120
You have to have room for
all that kind of thing.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.355
So there was a lot of that.

00:23:30.355 --> 00:23:32.200
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name's Corey.

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.430
I work at the Google
Children's Center.

00:23:35.430 --> 00:23:38.360
And one of the things that I
believe we at the Google

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:42.380
Children's Center and you have
in common is just this great,

00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:46.120
very intense respect for
children and their

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.430
perspective.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:50.630
So I've read, and I watch videos
of you talking about

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.240
respect for young children, and
how you write for children

00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:55.300
and adults, and I was just
wondering, can you talk a

00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.050
little bit about how do know, as
you're writing a story, is

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:00.000
this going to be for children?

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.745
Is this going to
be for adults?

00:24:02.745 --> 00:24:04.770
NEIL GAIMAN: Mostly, you know.

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.020
I mean, mostly.

00:24:09.091 --> 00:24:14.470
I was in China a few years ago,
and I was talking to my

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:15.650
Chinese publisher.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:20.380
And I said, why is it that none
of my picture books our

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.200
in print in simple Chinese
on the mainland?

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.690
My picture books are all in
print from Taiwan and in Hong

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:31.650
Kong, but nothing
on the mainland.

00:24:31.650 --> 00:24:38.180
And they said, ah, well, it's
because they show a lack of

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:43.010
respect for the family unit on
the part of the children and a

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:45.240
lack of respect for authority.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.230
And children question authority
in them, and they do

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:50.740
bad things, and they're
not punished.

00:24:50.740 --> 00:24:52.162
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:52.162 --> 00:24:54.160
NEIL GAIMAN: And
I thought, OK.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:57.550
So then it became a point of
honor for me, that I had to do

00:24:57.550 --> 00:25:01.720
a story in which all of those
things happened that would get

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.320
published in mainland China, and
I decided I would write a

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.070
book about a baby panda
who sneezed.

00:25:10.620 --> 00:25:12.940
So I did a book called
"Chu's Day."

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:17.860
And at that point, you know
you're writing for children.

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:20.550
You also know that whenever
you're writing for children,

00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:27.890
you're writing for adults, and
you're writing for adults that

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:31.120
if a kid likes a book-- if a
little kid likes a book--

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.260
it's not that you're going
to have to read

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:33.660
that book once a week.

00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:35.930
You may have to read that
book four times a night.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:37.562
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:37.562 --> 00:25:40.800
NEIL GAIMAN: For eight
months for a year.

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.400
There are books that I read my
kids that are imprinted on the

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.490
back of my head.

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:51.560
There was one called "Catch the
Red Bus" about a father

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.490
bear taking his family with
various colored modes of

00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.410
transportation to the seaside.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:25:58.340
It's not great literature.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.671
I could recite it all
still to this day.

00:26:00.671 --> 00:26:02.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:02.826 --> 00:26:10.660
NEIL GAIMAN: So you're always
aware of the adult readership.

00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:13.750
Sometimes you're writing
things for kids--

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:17.450
what I try and do is write for
me if I'm writing for kids,

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:20.530
and just go what did I like
when I was that age?

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:22.870
And not even what did I like
trying to look back at it, but

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.210
what is the seven-year-old
inside me like?

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:30.330
What does the 9-year-old, what
is the 11-year-old like?

00:26:30.330 --> 00:26:33.430
And that kind of works, treating
things with that kind

00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.000
of respect.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.840
I just did a book, which I'll
try and do a reading of-- when

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.210
we get to the end of this, I'll
do a little reading--

00:26:44.210 --> 00:26:49.100
called "Fortunately the Milk,"
which is ostensibly a kid's

00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:52.690
book, but it's probably the
funniest thing and the

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.010
silliest thing I've
ever written.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:02.340
And that I knew it was for
kids, but was absolutely,

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:08.160
happily, and joyfully throwing
in jokes and bits that were

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.340
simply for adults, and going
I don't really care.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:14.600
Adults and go and buy a version
with a respectable

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.310
cover or something.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:19.690
Next question?

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:21.770
AUDIENCE: In "American Gods"
and "The Sandman," you have

00:27:21.770 --> 00:27:24.640
this whole idea of gods being
just like people who walk

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.440
among us, who just have
normal lives.

00:27:26.440 --> 00:27:27.390
I think that's really cool.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:29.780
I was just wondering
how did that idea

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.030
start up in your head?

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:37.600
NEIL GAIMAN: I remember the
exact moment that the plot for

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.660
"American Gods" came together,
which was slightly different

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.490
to "Sandman." In "Sandman," I
just loved the idea that if I

00:27:45.490 --> 00:27:50.520
was going to do a story about an
anthropomorphic incarnation

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.840
of the idea of dreaming, that
he'd look human because it's a

00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.390
comic, and he has to look
like something.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:05.550
So at that point, when you're
bringing gods on, mostly in

00:28:05.550 --> 00:28:09.500
"Sandman" I kept my gods off in
cool, [? godey ?] places,

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.300
except for the few that
have retired.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.630
One was working as a travel
agent in there, and he

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:15.960
definitely retired.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:21.260
In "American Gods," it came from
another sort of thing.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:25.980
It came from me flying to
Iceland, having a stopover in

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:28.060
Iceland, getting in really early
in the morning, getting

00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:30.860
no sleep on the plane, but
going, you know, I'll just

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:34.460
keep going until it gets dark.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.400
And it was July the 3rd.

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.930
NEIL GAIMAN: I love the fact
that you guys have seen where

00:28:40.930 --> 00:28:44.310
this plan goes wrong
way before I did.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:48.860
And what actually happened in
Iceland was that about 3

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:52.630
o'clock in the morning, it got
a little bit overcast for

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.490
about half an hour, and
then the sun was out.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:56.380
And my body clock was just
going, I don't know

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.440
what's going on.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:03.240
So at 1 o'clock the following
day, I'm wandering the streets

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:07.350
of Reykjavik, and the
world has gone flat.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:12.580
Everything is flat, everything
is weird, and nothing is open

00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:14.690
except for a tourist office.

00:29:14.690 --> 00:29:16.560
So I wander into the tourist
office, because there's

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.670
nothing else in Reykjavik on
that Sunday, and I see the

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:27.770
travels of Leif Ericson laid
out on a tabletop diorama.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:31.220
And I look at them, I think,
that's really interesting.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.480
And then I thought, I wonder
if they brought

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.780
their gods with them.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:40.140
And suddenly it was like
everything was there.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:45.550
I thought, oh, obviously they
did, and then they died out.

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:49.060
And then having died out, the
gods will be just sort of

00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:52.820
hanging around, and now they'd
be eking out a living on the

00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.760
edge of things, pumping
gasoline

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.555
and doing minor scams.

00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.750
We'd have this sad, lonely, blue
collar gods, and I can

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:07.170
say everything I want to say
about the peculiar American

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.700
immigrant experience, which is
one that I was going through.

00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.180
I mean, having been here for
eight years, and going, you

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:13.790
know, it's nothing
like the movies.

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:14.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.110
NEIL GAIMAN: It seems to be a
real place with all sorts of

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:20.470
quirks that are not getting
documented.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.660
So that was the driving
point for that.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.410
AUDIENCE: In "The Ocean at
the End of the Lane," and

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.840
hopefully I can keep this
spoiler-free, after the first

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.680
cut and stitch, the narrator
says he wants to remember, and

00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:34.350
then he's still him.

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:38.040
But at the end of the book, he
doesn't remember anything that

00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:39.260
occurred at the farm.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:41.180
And I was hoping you could
explain your decision

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:42.313
to make that so.

00:30:42.313 --> 00:30:45.520
NEIL GAIMAN: God, not without
completely spoilering the

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.430
entire book, not only for
everyone here at Google, but

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:51.280
given that this will go up onto
the web, for everybody in

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.900
the whole world for all time.

00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.210
NEIL GAIMAN: Sidle over
to me at the end and

00:30:57.210 --> 00:30:59.270
we'll do two minutes.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:04.210
But it is a book in which
various strange things are

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:11.830
done with memory, and it is, as
my friend Terry Pratchett

00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:14.800
sometimes uses to describe
things, it is a very quantum

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:16.690
sort of a book.

00:31:16.690 --> 00:31:17.690
I was actually pleased.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:19.650
The "New York Times" just
reviewed it, and they did

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:22.930
actually observe something that
I felt when I was writing

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:27.800
it, which is it's probably not
science fiction, except it's

00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.810
science fiction in the Arthur
C. Clarkian sense of any

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:34.000
sufficiently advanced
technology is

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.450
indistinguishable from magic.

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:42.140
So you've got a kid who is
seeing things as magic that

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.243
probably, actually aren't.

00:31:43.243 --> 00:31:46.400
AUDIENCE: You've spoken about
possibly revisiting London

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.940
Below at some point.

00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:50.180
Any plans?

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:55.350
NEIL GAIMAN: So did anyone here
catch the BBC adaptation,

00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:58.155
the radio adaptation, of
"Neverwhere" recently?

00:31:58.155 --> 00:31:59.780
A couple of hands going up.

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.400
Wasn't it good?

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.470
A couple of hands get waved
enthusiastically.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:12.830
So BBC Radio 4 did an adaptation
of "Neverwhere, the

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.360
world of London Below, with
people like Benedict

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:20.190
Cumberbatch, and James McAvoy,
Sir Christopher Lee, all these

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:21.020
amazing actors.

00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:23.630
Anthony Steward Head,
Natalie Dormer.

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:24.490
A fantastic cast.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.720
Bernard Cribbins, which
meant a lot to me.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.300
And I loved listening to it, and
I got so enthused I went,

00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:33.610
oh, I miss this place.

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:40.520
And I'd been asked for a short
story by George RR Martin and

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.540
Gardner Dozois's for an
anthology they were putting

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.230
together called "Rogues."

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:50.280
So I sat down, and I wrote to my
first piece of "Neverwhere"

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:56.600
fiction in 15 years, and it's
a very long short story.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:58.640
I think probably, it's
technically a novelette.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.830
NEIL GAIMAN: Called "How the
Marquis Got His Coat Back."

00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:06.670
And it'll be published,
I guess, sometime in

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:11.100
2014, and it's fun.

00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:14.220
I get to do stuff that have
been in my head about the

00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:18.730
"Neverwhere" world for a long
time and had never actually

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:19.210
been written.

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:22.220
So you get to meet the shepherds
of Shepherd's Bush

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.530
and the elephant of Elephant
and Castle.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:28.050
So, yes, more coming.

00:33:28.050 --> 00:33:31.430
And then one day, I will
probably do the other

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:33.530
"Neverwhere" novel that I've
been meaning to do, which is

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:35.050
called "The Seven Sisters."

00:33:35.050 --> 00:33:36.940
I'm just a really lousy
writer of sequels.

00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:38.790
I always mean to.

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:41.030
People say Gaiman does not write
sequels as if there is a

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:42.570
moral imperative there.

00:33:42.570 --> 00:33:43.800
I will revisit stuff.

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.330
I'm not!

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:45.710
I always mean to.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:53.890
I'm just somebody who if on the
one hand I have the option

00:33:53.890 --> 00:34:02.320
of doing something that I've
done before, know how to do,

00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.310
that people liked, and that
people are waiting for, and

00:34:07.310 --> 00:34:11.175
that a publisher would pay me
a lot of money to do, and on

00:34:11.175 --> 00:34:14.139
the other hand I'd have
something that I have no idea

00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.090
how to do and no idea if people
like or not, I will

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:23.130
tend to go off on this
hand from a kind of

00:34:23.130 --> 00:34:25.880
"Oh, shiny," level.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.850
That's where I go.

00:34:27.850 --> 00:34:29.500
So I always mean to.

00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:32.790
Everything in my head, by the
time I finished it, I know

00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:35.000
where I'm going to
go next with it.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:35.580
Not everything.

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.219
There is no "Coraline
II" in my head.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:41.230
But most things. "Neverwhere,
there's more.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:42.674
"Stardust," there's more.

00:34:42.674 --> 00:34:44.270
"American Gods," there's more.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.429
I'm just rubbish at ever
getting to them.

00:34:47.429 --> 00:34:50.800
I go and do different
things instead.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.320
AUDIENCE: So do you have any
advice for someone who would

00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.860
like to start doing creative
writing but has no idea where

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.470
to start whatsoever?

00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:59.030
NEIL GAIMAN: Depends.

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:02.190
Are you the kind
of person who--

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.985
do you read a lot?

00:35:02.985 --> 00:35:05.050
AUDIENCE: I read a lot,
yes, and I write

00:35:05.050 --> 00:35:07.202
snarky emails [LAUGHTER]

00:35:07.202 --> 00:35:08.530
AUDIENCE: But that's about it.

00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:10.160
I've been told they're
very good.

00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.720
NEIL GAIMAN: When you say
creative writing, do you want

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:12.320
to write fiction?

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:13.710
Do you want to write
humorous essays?

00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:14.530
There's an awful lot--

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.870
AUDIENCE: Fiction,
I would think.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.020
NEIL GAIMAN: You want
to do stories?

00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:17.800
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.430
NEIL GAIMAN: OK.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.750
So my advice is start
writing stories.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.396
AUDIENCE: Just like, do it?

00:35:22.396 --> 00:35:24.620
NEIL GAIMAN: Really, it's almost
as simple as that.

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.940
It's start writing, pick
a style, pick a theme.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:34.790
You're not expected straight out
of the hat to be a brave

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:38.150
and original voice producing
fine and wonderful fiction.

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:42.490
It's much more like the first
pancake on the griddle, which

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:45.570
is going to do this weird,
black, messy thing that you

00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.610
will either give to your
dog or to a child.

00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:49.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:49.290 --> 00:35:50.110
NEIL GAIMAN: Trying to convince

00:35:50.110 --> 00:35:51.360
them, yeah, it's nice.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:36:00.490
You write, you finish things,
you start the next thing, you

00:36:00.490 --> 00:36:03.150
write that, you finish it.

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.456
Somewhere in there, you
get reasonably good.

00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:07.920
AUDIENCE: Give these
to people?

00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.695
Or do you just--

00:36:08.695 --> 00:36:11.130
NEIL GAIMAN: Yeah.

00:36:11.130 --> 00:36:17.440
The point I always found that
I would always learn more

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:20.850
about what I'd done the moment
I saw it in print, or these

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:22.090
days, probably the
moment you'd see

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:23.510
things up on the web.

00:36:23.510 --> 00:36:24.080
Buy, yeah.

00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.650
Show them to people.

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.920
But the most important thing
when you're just starting out

00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:30.510
is write the next one.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:35.210
Assume that you have a million
words inside you that are

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.000
absolute rubbish, and you need
to get them out before you get

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:39.760
to the good ones.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.160
And if you get there early,
that's great.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.745
That's really my
biggest advice.

00:36:43.745 --> 00:36:44.750
AUDIENCE: All right,
thank you.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:47.200
NEIL GAIMAN: Read everything
you can, read outside your

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.690
comfort zone, and write a lot.

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.460
AUDIENCE: One of the things
that I've noticed--

00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:56.630
I've been following you
since "Sandman"--

00:36:56.630 --> 00:36:58.300
is that you've definitely
tried lots of different

00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.210
mediums and different
media types.

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:02.670
I've wondered if you've ever
thought about going into any

00:37:02.670 --> 00:37:04.990
of the interactive media types
like video games or anything

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.720
like that with your writing?

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.940
NEIL GAIMAN: Back in the '90s,
I had about four excursions

00:37:12.940 --> 00:37:17.595
into the world of video games
and computer games.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:22.980
There was a "Sandman" game that
was meant to be really

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.460
cool, and worked on that
for a long time.

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:27.030
There was several others.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.510
And what would happen is I would
put in a lot of work on

00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:33.010
these things.

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:37.310
And normally, contracts would
get signed in there, and

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:40.215
somewhere between contract
signing and the first check

00:37:40.215 --> 00:37:44.360
being cut, I would get a sad
phone call explaining that

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:48.010
they were now going out of
business, and it was lovely

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:49.880
working with me.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.060
There was one company who
actually said, OK, they're

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:55.650
coming in to shut us down
this afternoon.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.750
I have the notebook computer
that we were going to send you

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:00.680
on my desk.

00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:03.790
I'm putting it in a FedEx
envelope with your name on it,

00:38:03.790 --> 00:38:05.320
and then I'm losing
the FedEx slip.

00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:06.810
You didn't get it from me.

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:07.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:09.670
NEIL GAIMAN: And they were
gone that afternoon.

00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:11.750
But I went, well, at least
this time I got a

00:38:11.750 --> 00:38:12.510
computer out of it.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:13.760
That's kind of cool.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.470
So somewhere by the end of the
'90s, that sort of went from

00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:25.360
'93 through about '99, and
I thought I cannot be

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:31.050
responsible for somehow,
Jonah-like, destroying any

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:35.560
more of these nice start-ups, or
these otherwise apparently

00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.380
healthy companies.

00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:37.750
They show me all the
stuff they've done.

00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.750
I go this is great, and then
they start with me, and they

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.695
lie on their back, and put their
legs in the air, and

00:38:43.695 --> 00:38:44.580
move no more.

00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.348
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:46.348 --> 00:38:50.440
NEIL GAIMAN: Very recently I've
started toying with and

00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:52.670
playing with and getting a
little bit involved in the

00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:57.530
sort of dipping my toe
in kind of territory.

00:38:57.530 --> 00:38:59.400
Again, very nervously just
going, well, I like you

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.280
people, but I don't want to
drive you out of business.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:02.900
But we'll see.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:09.835
If enough time has passed,
maybe things will change.

00:39:09.835 --> 00:39:11.170
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.110
My name is Leila, and when
things don't go so well for

00:39:14.110 --> 00:39:17.080
me, I try to make good art.

00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:20.770
And me and my wife really,
really enjoy your work, and I

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:23.310
know that your wife was the
inspiration behind this book,

00:39:23.310 --> 00:39:25.040
as you've mentioned before.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:28.400
And I really, really enjoy
your wife's work as well.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.760
She's an amazing singer,
an amazing composer.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.070
And I was wondering, has
she ever written

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.360
any songs about you?

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.730
And if she has, what
are they called?

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.578
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.578 --> 00:39:43.720
NEIL GAIMAN: It is a bone of
occasional contention between

00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:49.990
us at this point that the song
that I actually show up in as

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:56.310
me the most and for the longest
is a humorous song--

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.360
but true--

00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.970
by my wife about how much
she hates Vegemite.

00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.838
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.838 --> 00:40:06.570
AUDIENCE: Mine hates
vegetables.

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:07.780
NEIL GAIMAN: She also
hates Marmite.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.870
I It's this English yeast-based
spread.

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.550
Pretty salty, but you can spread
on things, and nobody

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:16.040
except the English and
Australians like, and the

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:20.460
Australians had Marmite, and
the English don't really--

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.200
are they different?

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:22.872
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:22.872 --> 00:40:25.690
NEIL GAIMAN: You just try
getting into Australia now.

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:27.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:27.634 --> 00:40:30.030
NEIL GAIMAN: Not only are they
different, but I discovered

00:40:30.030 --> 00:40:31.890
through extensive Googling
at one point when I got

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:34.290
interested that--

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:38.020
Googling, capital G, obviously,
and whatever TMs

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:41.290
and copyright things need--

00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:46.080
through extensive Googling that
New Zealand Marmite is

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:49.570
sugary and sweet, and it's
a completely different--

00:40:49.570 --> 00:40:51.870
while they have the name
Marmite, it's actually nothing

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:54.310
like English Marmite.

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.070
But she wrote this song which
begins with this whole thing

00:40:57.070 --> 00:41:03.050
about how much she loves me, and
then goes rapidly into why

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:08.460
I eat Vegemite, and will
put this evil,

00:41:08.460 --> 00:41:10.130
cancerous stuff on my bread.

00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:16.660
And it's a heartbreaking
song for me.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.530
For everybody else, they just
think it's really funny, and

00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.210
I'm going, no, I love you.

00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:22.890
Why this song?

00:41:22.890 --> 00:41:23.710
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:26.290
NEIL GAIMAN: So that, I think,
is the only song that I

00:41:26.290 --> 00:41:28.510
actually really get
to crop in as me.

00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:33.590
And she had a very bad
experience with Marmite as a

00:41:33.590 --> 00:41:37.810
small girl when the English
neighbors were babysitting,

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:42.150
and the neighbor kid got a large
spoon of Marmite and

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.060
told her it was chocolate
spread.

00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.748
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:45.748 --> 00:41:48.100
NEIL GAIMAN: So her first
experience with Marmite was

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:52.550
every bit as bad as my first
experience with wasabi, which

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:53.515
is another story for
another day.

00:41:53.515 --> 00:41:56.070
AUDIENCE: I actually though
wasabi was avocados, so I

00:41:56.070 --> 00:41:57.330
popped the whole thing
in my mouth.

00:41:57.330 --> 00:41:58.430
NEIL GAIMAN: Ditto.

00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:59.165
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:59.165 --> 00:42:00.480
AUDIENCE: I understand,
thank you.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:03.190
NEIL GAIMAN: There is a moment
where you are suddenly staring

00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:04.310
out of your nostrils.

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.982
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:04.982 --> 00:42:07.390
NEIL GAIMAN: How this is
physically possible, I don't

00:42:07.390 --> 00:42:09.960
know, but you are gazing
on the naked,

00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.706
screaming face of God.

00:42:11.706 --> 00:42:15.460
And in my case, of course, I was
at an incredibly important

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:18.260
dinner with incredibly important
people, had just

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:21.280
done this thing, and then spent
the longest two minutes

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.980
of my life waiting for the other
people at the dinner all

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:26.210
to look the other way so I could
get it out of my mouth

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.460
and into a napkin.

00:42:29.970 --> 00:42:31.720
Yes, let's do one more question,
and then I'm going

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.347
to read a little bit
more to you.

00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:40.030
AUDIENCE: What are
your feelings or

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.560
thoughts about patents?

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.340
The reason I ask is [LAUGHING]

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.730
two ladies recently--

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:53.870
I don't know how recently-- came
out with an inflatable

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:57.490
bike helmet, and every time I
talk to somebody about it,

00:42:57.490 --> 00:43:01.020
they talk about, oh yeah, Neil
Gaiman had that idea in "Snow

00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:01.925
Crash."

00:43:01.925 --> 00:43:03.470
NEIL GAIMAN: That was actually
Neal Stephenson.

00:43:03.470 --> 00:43:04.680
It's the other Neil!

00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.964
There's two of us.

00:43:05.964 --> 00:43:08.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:08.425 --> 00:43:10.460
NEIL GAIMAN: It's OK, I love
it when that happens.

00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:16.830
He's the other Neil.

00:43:16.830 --> 00:43:20.056
He is the bold-bearded Neal
who spells it with a A.

00:43:20.056 --> 00:43:21.200
CHRIS DIBONA: Less hair.

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.200
NEIL GAIMAN: He has less
hair up there,

00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.660
more hair down there.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.270
And the best thing about Neal
Stephenson is we have a

00:43:28.270 --> 00:43:32.110
photograph of the two of
us with Neil Armstrong.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:37.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:44.360
NEIL GAIMAN: Forming the perfect
trifecta of Neils.

00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:46.185
I will throw in one
bonus question.

00:43:46.185 --> 00:43:47.750
Person in red, come forward.

00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:50.420
CHRIS DIBONA: A palate
cleanser.

00:43:50.420 --> 00:43:54.405
AUDIENCE: There is obviously a
huge mythological component in

00:43:54.405 --> 00:43:56.590
your-- not a component, an
oeuvre in your work--

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.690
and especially Hindu mythology
as well, which I was very

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:00.850
surprised to find.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:01.310
Could you--

00:44:01.310 --> 00:44:04.820
what inspires you to include
through so much myth

00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:06.070
in all of your work?

00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.850
NEIL GAIMAN: The question is
what inspires me to put so

00:44:11.850 --> 00:44:13.410
myth into my work--

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:18.290
I wish I had an origin story.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.775
I really do.

00:44:19.775 --> 00:44:22.490
I would say, well, when I was
four years old, I was bitten

00:44:22.490 --> 00:44:23.830
by a radioactive myth.

00:44:23.830 --> 00:44:26.170
And people go, ah
ha, that was it.

00:44:26.170 --> 00:44:28.830
And I don't.

00:44:28.830 --> 00:44:34.370
I do know that when I was
about six years old, I

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:38.180
stumbled upon a copy of Roger
Lancelyn Green's "Tales of the

00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:43.850
Norsemen" and just loved all
of the stories of Thor and

00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.520
Odin and Loki and the giants.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:47.450
And I just thought these
are fantastic.

00:44:47.450 --> 00:44:52.660
And I saved up my own pocket
money, and I went out, and

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.910
there was another book by him,
"Myths and Legends of Ancient

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:58.890
Egypt," and I went and bought
that, and just thought this

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:00.060
stuff is amazing.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.030
This is so cool.

00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:03.200
This is the best stuff.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:10.640
So wherever I could after
that, I would read myth.

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:13.400
I discovered very rapidly
that you actually

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.830
get the coolest stuff.

00:45:14.830 --> 00:45:18.240
And this was hugely important,
I think, when I was a kid and

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.050
started realizing that in the
books of myths they told for

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:24.800
kids, they took out the sex
and the violence and the

00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.730
really weird bits.

00:45:26.730 --> 00:45:31.160
But if you went into the adult
section and read the books on

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.340
myths, you could get
the completely

00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:37.570
brain mashing stuff.

00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:41.820
So I would absolutely do that.

00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:47.440
But I love methodologies, And
I genuinely love building

00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:51.620
them, I love thinking about
them, I love creating them,

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:53.310
and I love playing with them.

00:45:53.310 --> 00:45:55.700
And they tend to be
very equal for me.

00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:58.310
One of the reasons, I think,
why I had so much fun, and

00:45:58.310 --> 00:46:03.870
I've had so much fun, writing my
episodes of "Doctor Who" is

00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:08.790
that was the first mythology
I ever really encountered.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:11.720
I was three years old, and
I discovered the Daleks.

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:19.130
And by the time I was five, I
knew what TARDIS stood for.

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:22.560
And I got my dad to buy me a
copy of "Dalek World" on

00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:27.900
Victoria Station, and it was
this amazing hardback, large

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.060
format book with comics and
articles about Daleks, and I

00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.570
learned all this stuff.

00:46:33.570 --> 00:46:35.800
I knew the history of Skaro.

00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:38.820
I learned that measles
was a Dalek disease.

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:41.560
I discovered that Daleks cannot
see the color red,

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.740
which worried me because
there are red Daleks.

00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.464
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:45.464 --> 00:46:48.510
NEIL GAIMAN: And I would worry
about what they could see.

00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:51.410
My God, that was weird, just
some bumps went past.

00:46:54.816 --> 00:46:58.110
It's only funny if you like
"Doctor Who." Otherwise, you

00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.680
can sit there going, I have no
idea what he's talking about.

00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.530
But you know, I love
mythologies, and I love

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:03.800
building them.

00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:07.380
So for me, it's part
of the fun.

00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:08.000
And thank you.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:09.550
AUDIENCE: Thank you for
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:11.540
NEIL GAIMAN: You
are so welcome.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:16.600
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:21.610
NEIL GAIMAN: Given that I'm
talking to Google, and given

00:47:21.610 --> 00:47:24.160
that you are obviously the
great minds of our

00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.820
generation--

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.500
I know this because my
son is one of you--

00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:35.680
I thought it would be really
nice to finish with a reading

00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.520
from my next book, which has not
come out yet, and will not

00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:41.690
come out until September.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:46.990
And this is a book called
"Fortunately the Milk." that

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.790
was actually in peculiar ways
inspired by my son, Mike.

00:47:55.090 --> 00:48:00.755
And it's about a dad.

00:48:00.755 --> 00:48:06.360
It's about a father who gets
to go off and do one of the

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:13.760
heroic and brave things that
fathers get to do, which is to

00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:19.520
say, go out and get the milk
for his children's cereal.

00:48:19.520 --> 00:48:29.950
And he takes a long time to get
back, and when asked why,

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.585
he starts to explain.

00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:38.650
Well, let me tell you in his own
words why he takes a while

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:42.512
to come back with the milk
for their cereal.

00:48:42.512 --> 00:48:45.520
"'I bought the milk,'
said my father.

00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:48.640
'And I did indeed say a brief
hello to Mr. Ronson from over

00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:50.070
the road who was
buying a paper.

00:48:50.070 --> 00:48:52.550
I walked out of the corner shop
and heard something odd

00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:54.810
that seemed to be coming
from above me.

00:48:54.810 --> 00:48:57.040
It was a noise like this.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.380
Thum, thum.

00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.880
I looked up and saw a huge
silver disk hovering in the

00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:05.190
air above Marshall Road.

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.820
Hello, I said to myself.

00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:09.060
That's not something
you see every day.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:11.530
And then something
odd happened.'

00:49:11.530 --> 00:49:13.555
'That wasn't odd?' I asked.

00:49:13.555 --> 00:49:15.870
'Well, something odder,'
said my father.

00:49:15.870 --> 00:49:18.160
'The odd thing was the beam of
light that came out of the

00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:21.110
disk, a glittery, shimmery beam
of light that was visible

00:49:21.110 --> 00:49:22.030
even in the daylight.

00:49:22.030 --> 00:49:23.280
And the next thing I
knew, I was being

00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:24.600
sucked up into the disk.

00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:27.880
Fortunately, I put the milk
into my coat pocket.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:29.640
The deck of the disk
was metal.

00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:34.400
It was as big as a playing
field or bigger.'

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.980
'We have come to your planet
form a world very far away,'

00:49:37.980 --> 00:49:39.515
said the people in the desk.

00:49:39.515 --> 00:49:41.710
I call them people, but they
were a bit green and rather

00:49:41.710 --> 00:49:44.130
globby, and they look
very grumpy indeed.

00:49:44.130 --> 00:49:46.600
'Now as a representative of your
species we, demand that

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:49.060
you give us ownership
of the whole planet.

00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.905
We are going to remodel it.'

00:49:50.905 --> 00:49:54.160
'I jolly well won't,' I said.

00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.640
'Then,' it said, 'we will bring
all your enemies and

00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.930
have them make you miserable
until you agree to sign the

00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.040
planet over to us.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.190
I was going to point out to them
that I didn't have any

00:50:03.190 --> 00:50:06.070
enemies when I noticed a large
metal door with 'Emergency

00:50:06.070 --> 00:50:10.100
Exit, do not open for any
reason, this means you' on it.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.945
I opened the door.

00:50:11.945 --> 00:50:15.020
'Don't do that,' said a
green, globby person.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:18.630
'You'll let the space-time
continuum in.' But it was too

00:50:18.630 --> 00:50:21.510
late, I had already pushed
open the door.

00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:23.170
I jumped.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.720
I was falling.

00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.900
Fortunately, I'd kept tight hold
of the milk, so when I

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:30.480
splashed into the sea,
I didn't lose it.

00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.010
'What was that?" said
a woman's voice.

00:50:33.010 --> 00:50:34.210
'A big fish?

00:50:34.210 --> 00:50:35.500
A mermaid?

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:37.870
Or was it a spy?'

00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:40.030
I wanted to say that I wasn't
any of those things, but my

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:42.060
mouth was full of seawater.

00:50:42.060 --> 00:50:43.710
I felt myself being a
hauled up onto the

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:44.920
deck of a little ship.

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.015
There were a number of men and
a woman on the deck, and they

00:50:47.015 --> 00:50:49.115
all looked very cross.

00:50:49.115 --> 00:50:53.280
'Who be ye, land lubber?' said
the woman, who had a big hat

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:56.400
on her head and a parrot
on her shoulder.

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:57.575
'He's a spy!

00:50:57.575 --> 00:51:01.070
A walrus in a coat, a new
kind of mermaid with

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:04.250
legs,' said the men.

00:51:04.250 --> 00:51:07.050
'What are you doing here?"
asked the woman.

00:51:07.050 --> 00:51:09.680
'Well,' I said, 'I just set
out to the corner shop for

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:12.020
some milk for my children's
breakfast and for my tea, and

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:12.960
the next thing I knew--'

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:17.310
'He's lying your, majesty!' She
pulled out her cutlass.

00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:20.390
'You dare lie to the queen
of the pirates?"

00:51:20.390 --> 00:51:23.520
Fortunately I'd kept tight hold
of the milk, and now I

00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.400
pointed to it.

00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:28.020
'If I did not go to the corner
shop to fetch the milk,' I

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.520
asked them, 'then where did this
milk come from?' At this,

00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.440
the pirates were completely
speechless.

00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.390
'Now,' I said, 'if you could let
me off somewhere near to

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:38.843
my destination, I would be
much obliged to you.'

00:51:38.843 --> 00:51:41.140
'And where would that happen
to be?' said the

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.280
queen of the pirates.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.390
'On the corner of Marshall Road
and Fletcher Lane,' I

00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:46.773
said. 'My children are waiting
for their breakfast.'

00:51:46.773 --> 00:51:50.270
'You're o n pirate ship now,
my fine bucko,' said the

00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:53.380
pirate queen, 'and you don't
get dropped off anywhere!

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:55.350
There are only two choices.

00:51:55.350 --> 00:51:58.275
You can join my pirate crew,
or refuse to join and will

00:51:58.275 --> 00:52:00.450
slit your cowardly throat, and
we'll go to the bottom of the

00:52:00.450 --> 00:52:03.410
sea where you will
feed the fishes.'

00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:06.960
'What about walking the
plank?" I said.

00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.990
'Never heard of it,"
said the pirates.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:11.860
'Walking the plank,' I said,
'is what proper pirates do.

00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.600
Look, I'll show you.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.980
Do have a plank anywhere?'

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.770
It took some looking, but we
found the plank, and showed

00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:21.610
the pirates where to put it.

00:52:21.610 --> 00:52:23.970
We discussed nailing it down,
but the pirate queen decided

00:52:23.970 --> 00:52:27.130
it was safer just to have the
two fattest pirates sit

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:29.030
on the end of it.

00:52:29.030 --> 00:52:30.490
'Why exactly do you
want to walk the

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:34.190
plank?' the pirate queen.

00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:35.420
I edged out onto the plank.

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.640
The blue Caribbean water
splashed gently beneath me.

00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:41.730
'Well,' I said, 'I've seen lots
of stories with pirates

00:52:41.730 --> 00:52:44.650
in them, and it seems to me if
I'm going to be rescued--'

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:47.060
At this, the pirates started
to laugh so hard their

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.480
stomachs wobbled, and the parrot
took off into the air

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:49.910
in amazement.

00:52:49.910 --> 00:52:51.870
'Rescue?' they said. 'There's
no rescue out here!

00:52:51.870 --> 00:52:54.118
We're in the middle
of the sea.

00:52:54.118 --> 00:52:56.490
'Nevertheless,' I told them,
'if you're going to be

00:52:56.490 --> 00:53:00.620
rescued, it will always be
while walking the plank.'

00:53:00.620 --> 00:53:03.570
'Which we don't do," said the
pirate queen. "Here! have a

00:53:03.570 --> 00:53:05.990
Spanish doubloon and come and
join us in our piratical

00:53:05.990 --> 00:53:06.800
adventures.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:09.040
It's the 18th century,' she
added, 'and there's always

00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:12.900
room for a bright, enthusiastic
pirate."

00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:14.650
I caught the doubloon.

00:53:14.650 --> 00:53:16.480
'I almost wish that I could,'
I told her, 'but I have

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.290
children, and they need
their breakfast.'

00:53:19.290 --> 00:53:20.585
'Then you must die.

00:53:20.585 --> 00:53:22.080
Walk the plank.'

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:24.530
I edged out to the
end of the plank.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:25.660
Sharks were circling.

00:53:25.660 --> 00:53:28.880
So what piranhas.

00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.790
And this was where I interrupted
my dad for the

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:32.220
first time.

00:53:32.220 --> 00:53:34.130
'Hang on,' I said.
'Piranhas are a

00:53:34.130 --> 00:53:37.502
freshwater fish.' [LAUGHTER]

00:53:37.502 --> 00:53:41.160
NEIL GAIMAN: "'What were
they doing in the sea?'

00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.590
'You're right,' said
my father.

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:43.710
'The piranhas were later.

00:53:43.710 --> 00:53:44.130
Right.

00:53:44.130 --> 00:53:47.850
So, I was out at the end of the
plank facing certain death

00:53:47.850 --> 00:53:49.820
when a rope ladder hit my
shoulder and a deep, booming

00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:56.750
voice shouted, 'Quickly, climb
up the rope ladder!'

00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:59.250
I needed no more encouragement
than this, and I grabbed the

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:00.350
rope ladder with both hands.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:02.100
Fortunately, the milk was
pushed deep into the

00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:03.810
pocket of my coat.

00:54:03.810 --> 00:54:06.160
The pirates hurled insults
at me and even discharged

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.030
pistols, but neither insults
nor pistol shot found their

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:12.990
targets, and I soon made it to
the top of the rope ladder.

00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:15.255
I'd never been in the basket
of a hot air balloon.

00:54:15.255 --> 00:54:17.930
It was very peaceful up there.

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:20.810
The person in the balloon basket
said, 'I hope you don't

00:54:20.810 --> 00:54:23.300
mind me helping, but it looked
like you were having problems

00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:25.210
down there.'

00:54:25.210 --> 00:54:28.310
I said, 'You're a
stegosaurus.'"

00:54:28.310 --> 00:54:36.410
[LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE]

00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:52.798
[MUSIC PLAYING]
