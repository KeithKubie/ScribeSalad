Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab, and today we've been investigating the truth, the fact of the matter, and this next segment to set it up. I guess all I really want to say is it sometimes getting to the fact of the matter, a fact of the matter, the way Arrow just did. That can be tricky. Yeah. You end up finding things that you didn't expect that are way more complicated than you expected. The story begins with our producer, Pat Walters started for him when he was talking with an ex CIA agent.

Speaker 2:          00:31          So maybe you've taken me to, was this the summer of 1981?

Speaker 1:          00:37          Okay. In the summer of 1981, I was being transferred from a one overseas post to another. This is a mural [inaudible] and I'm a retired CIA officer. But in 1981 Merle was still at the CIA and he was posted out in the sticks out and in the Boonies, somewhere in Southeast Asia. And, and, and why, why were you [inaudible]? Yeah, I had, I had a little disagreement with my, uh, previous chief and I ended up in, uh, in this remote, a jungle backwater, I guess is the best way to phrase it. Can you say what country you in? Um, I'd rather not.

Speaker 3:          01:17          Oh.

Speaker 2:          01:17          In any case, as much as Merle did not want to be there, it turned out that this little backwater was ground zero for what was about to become one of the strangest stories of the Cold War. Just to set the scene. The story happens in Laos, which is that kind of narrow country between Vietnam and Thailand. The time is a few years after the Vietnam War, right after the war, U s army left pulled out all of our troops and once we were gone, the communists basically took over the region, the communist being the Vietcong and their allies and Laos, the path at Lao group, outdoor Lucia Chateau,

Speaker 1:          01:53          gee, it was may of 1975. All of a sudden, the Vietcong, the Pathet Lao had infiltrated and they were all over our village and I knew that the Americans had left.

Speaker 2:          02:02          This is an Yang. Robin and I spoke with him and his niece. Kalia translated for us. [inaudible] lives in Minneapolis, but in 1975 he lived in a tiny village in the mountains of Laos. [inaudible] is part of a tribe called the Mon and inc says, as soon as the Americans left, Lao and Vietnamese soldiers showed up in his village, there was a hundred of them. They came in cars and in a way you could say they were out for revenge because during Vietnam War, thousands of Mong soldiers had fought on our side and as soon as we were out of the picture, that's when the killing started. Thanks. As it began with isolated attacks, [inaudible] pod villagers started getting killed in random fields. [inaudible] they just find one of their neighbors shot dead in his rice patty one day or a woman would go fetch water and never come back. Yellow car show done a partial for long. It was a village and I know the name of the village. I know the name of the village chief, the pathic Lao, which again is the communist army in Laos had gotten suspicious that these villagers may have been hiding guns in the jungle, like plotting to rebel against the government. So one day, but that law went over and you thought, or the whole village,

Speaker 4:          03:15          that's when we knew that the laws of humanity had been, had been terminated

Speaker 2:          03:20          and not long after that. And in his family long with thousands of other mung flood their villages when the hiding in the jungle, this is where things stood when Merle got his assignment and um, before he left DC and flew over to Asia, I stopped in our headquarters and while I was there I was briefed by our desk officer who told him about what was happening with communist raids, the on fleeing. But then the desk officer said something kind of odd. There had been these reports from refugees, refugees, like an about this yellow, these yellow droplets falling from the air.

Speaker 5:          04:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          04:00          PBS went out to the camps and interviewed some of the refugees, Wendy and crab who, oh, area. I said this yellow stuff that was falling out of the sky was coming from planes. We only saw the powders free prom. Yet some refugees talked about powder, some talked about liquid, you know a yellow miss sometimes, but they all said whatever this was. When it landed, it mean people buy a mentally ill and they all talked about how after this stuff fell from the sky, when did powder reach the ground? It's dark on everything left behind is yellow spots.

Speaker 4:          04:29          Well now you know yellow drops everywhere all over the landscape.

Speaker 2:          04:34          Ang remember the first time you saw it? Oh, show it Amanda. She was hiding in the woods somewhere and somebody came running into him and said, Ang, you have to come and see this yellow stuff. Just fell on a village up on the hill, ran up the hill and sort of crashed out of the forest and just stopped.

Speaker 6:          04:50          No,

Speaker 4:          04:51          right there at the edge of the village, a glued Lucia toe. I learned let p electronic too. I saw my dad call and two dead pigs and several dead chicken and all the people who've been exposed, they, they were all having stomach trouble.

Speaker 2:          05:04          Ink says people were doubled over carving their stomach writhing in pain, throwing up some, throwing up blood [inaudible] things that people began to suffer from. Everything from diarrhea to headaches, rashes.

Speaker 4:          05:16          There was a person, and I have the photo right here in my keeping a, her Capa Ma, who had been exposed in her eyes, her eyes were destroyed entirely, and many people inc says, didn't recover. What I saw was people dying, they wouldn't get better. They would die.

Speaker 2:          05:32          Hmm. Marel says the thought in CIA was that this might be some kind of chemical weapon, right? Did it have a name at that point? Yellow rain, yellow rain. By the time Marel got to Southeast Asia, hundreds of these reports had come in. Hundreds and several thousand people had been reported killed by this stuff. But you know, in those kinds of situations and in Southeast Asia, generally, you know there are tons of rumors, but you have to be careful of what you believe, what you don't believe, and you have to rely on evidence, which they just didn't have no until all of a sudden they did. Just a few months after Maura got there and they started getting these reports that refugees and collected samples off of leaves, some refugees had shown up with leaves covered in these yellow spots. Here's a closeout where I see, look again, this is Matt Mussels and he's at Harvard chemists and chemical weapons expert. The U S government asks to help examine these samples. Yeah, I went up and visited him in his office in Cambridge. Here's some on leaves. These are only leaves rug back. These are all dried out. Now this leaves are small, black, brittle, which only makes the spot stand out even more because there's this incredible bright yellow. They're tiny. They're there two or three millimeters across. And that says, when scientists put these leaves under a microscope and looked inside the yellow spots, they saw that the spots had a very high content of toxin called t two

Speaker 2:          06:52          which is a poison. And while T2 does grow in nature, the concentrations that they found in these spots was way too high to have occurred naturally in which demonstrated that this was, you know, in fact a, uh, a new type of a chemical weapon.

Speaker 7:          07:08          Okay.

Speaker 8:          07:08          We now had physical evidence.

Speaker 2:          07:11          This is secretary of State Alexander Haig, the fall of 1981,

Speaker 8:          07:15          which has been analyzed and found to contain abnormally high levels of potent mycotoxins and eating poisonous substance in the United States. Said today it has evidence that chemical warfare has been waged in parts of Southeast Asia. The U s obtained a test sample of twigs and leaves. Chemical analysis found high levels of three toxic chemicals.

Speaker 2:          07:37          The news of this poisonous yellow rain became an instant political crisis. Refugees in camps along the Thai border had been telling for years of a yellow rain or rain that was followed in limits by vomiting, bleeding, and death. Because everybody knew the Lao and Vietnamese armies were not capable of making this stuff. No Vietnam could not even make their own rifles. They were pretty backward in that sense, which really left only one likely suspect circumstantial evidence points to the Russians. The Soviet Union may be engaging in biological warfare. The Soviets, of course denied. They were involved. Soviets said it was a slanderous accusation that the u s government did not believe them. Show me your union. Their allies are violating the Geneva Protocol of 1925 and in the summer of 1982 in a speech to the UN, President Reagan officially accused the Soviet Union of supplying and using chemical weapons in Southeast Asia. There is conclusive evidence that the Soviet government has provided toxins for you should allow and camp a chia. Three years later, Congress passed legislation authorizing the production of a chemical bomb called the big guy, the 500 pound bomb, and it's been to be carried on high performance here and within two years in factory in pen bluff, Arkansas, again churning out thousands of bounds designed to carry Sarah and gas. Really? I don't know why

Speaker 7:          08:55          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:56          this would be the first time the United States had manufactured a chemical weapon in nearly 20 years. All this in effect because of the yellow rain.

Speaker 9:          09:08          Ooh,

Speaker 2:          09:09          but before we jump ahead, in the, in November of 1982 they were two days of press briefings by the State Department, and this is where things really start to get weird. The State Department had gotten everybody together to explain it. Some British scientists had looked at the spots and in addition to the poison, they found something else. All the samples had a very high content of pollen from flowers, which initially didn't make any sense like why would pollen be toxic? But eventually the government officials came to this kind of terrifying conclusion that in fact, this was a very, very clever communist mixture. Somehow the Russians had found a way to use pollen as a vector to transmit this toxin. If it falls right on your skin, it would intoxicate you poison you, but if these drops should fall on a leaf or a rock, then the wind would read, disperse these Poland Greens, which we've just the right diameter to penetrate to the dip the lungs, thereby making it a more deadly weapon.

Speaker 2:          10:15          Matt remembers hearing that and thinking that just seemed completely bonkers to me. I knew a lot about chemical weapons. And you'd never heard of anything like that before? No. So he sent some of these samples around to other scientists. He knew in one afternoon he's sitting in his lab and he gets a call. I remember the phone call is the guy who called and Tom Sealy. I'm a professor in the department of Neurobiology and behavior at Cornell University. Matt pick up the phone. Tom said to him, Hey, I analyzed the samples you sent me, and then he said, the State Department explanation is not parsimonious, meaning meaning this yellow stuff is not a chemical weapon. Then he paused. He said it's B, and then he used a four letter word. I think we can use that word because that all right. Yeah. You said it was beaten

Speaker 9:          11:01          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:02          what these what we call fecal spot of Honeybee

Speaker 9:          11:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:07          that was their idea. Yeah. They were like, look, here's the thing. Every winter bees kind of hibernate during the winter. There are no flowers and there is no Pauline, there's no nectar. There's nothing for the bees to go out and collect so that they stay inside confined to their hives all winter feeding their babies fattening up the new worker bees for the next season. And since they're very fastidious, they do not defecate in their nests. They don't poop all winter. Right. So the become immensely constipated. And then on the first warm days, they all fly out on mass to like a hundred feet off the ground.

Speaker 9:          11:47          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:48          all at the same time. It is called the cleansing flight in anybody who cultures, bees. And if you get caught beneath the situation, Tom says,

Speaker 10:         11:57          it feels like light raindrops hitting your arms, hitting your forehead.

Speaker 2:          12:01          So this was their theory that the yellow rain was not a chemical weapon, it was just be droppings. They published this and the government was like, seriously, even a bunch of prestigious scientists came forward and said that it was an absurd explanation. Kind of crazy and embarrassing a, let's not forget that this rain was toxic and B, honeybees and southeast Asia don't even hibernate. There is no winter in Southeast Asia. It's the tropics. So Southeast Asian bees never get constipated and they never do the big poop. Those Eric, good objections. No, Matt and Tom Counter by going to Thailand 12 and I flew out there and they go into the jungle plants and beehives and one day they're staring up at a high end in the flesh. They see it happen. The bees shoot up into the sky

Speaker 10:         12:45          and within a minute or two after that we started to get rained upon by the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          12:51          B feces. So to tell the government, sorry, we think it happens here too. [inaudible] wait, that's only half of it. I mean what about the toxic part? The whole idea that these bees are pooping poison. That is a hard one, but while Matt and Tom were in Thailand, some labs had started retesting those original samples because you see the poison had been detected by one particular lab in Minnesota at the beginning, but now that these yellow spots were such a big deal, other labs all over the world began to retest them and they couldn't find anything. British never found trees. The Swedes never found a trace. The Way Matt sees it, the analyses were wrong. He thinks that lab, the lab in Minnesota that had been doing this work inadvertently contaminated the pollen because this lab did lots of other work with Mycotoxins, large quantities of these toxins. The government obviously wanted to be sure they did their own rules, tests of the samples. They didn't find anything. They sent a team to Southeast Asia to verify the bees do the poop shower thing and they do.

Speaker 10:         13:56          And my friend, it's a good friend pong tip who was part of that team, told me that in the bar at the end of this multiday excursion, off the record, one of the gentlemen said, well, I guess we owe the Soviets and apology on this one,

Speaker 2:          14:09          which hasn't ever happened. In fact, yellow rain is still, that's morale again in the U S Army Chemical Corps manual is, you know, one of the, the possible weapons that might be used. Oh really? Yeah, it's still there. It's still, it's still there.

Speaker 4:          14:25          I have a, I have a clarifying question before I interpreted that. So, so they found toxins initially and then when they looked again at those samples that talk to them were no longer there. That's right. Okay. A lot. Like, you know, I had the [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          14:39          at a certain point in our conversation with Ang, the Hmong guy, Robin and I talked to earlier with his niece, Kalia translating for him. We explained that the evidence they'd been attacked by chemical weapons seem. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          14:50          I interpreted that for uncle

Speaker 2:          14:52          a little shaky. Hi John [inaudible]. Uh, [inaudible] ain't response was if this was just be thesis, how do you explain the kids dying, the, the people and the animals dying? Uh, where there is this yellow thing where there are no bees, um, whole whole villages die. We asked Kalia to tell Ang what the scientists had told us that the Hmong were definitely dying. The moment were under real attack. They were being fired out from airplanes and by soldiers. And, but more importantly, even if they weren't killed by those direct attacks, they were on the run through the jungle mountain nourished and drinking from contaminated streams. Diseases like dysentery and cholera were rampant. And the way a lot of people see it is that they may have missed, attributed some of those mysterious deaths to this cloud of bee poop that looked like it could have been a chemical weapon.

Speaker 4:          15:44          Hi, John Gig with hydro Noosa. The Ang says no more [inaudible] not a chance to what I've seen, and there is no inkling in my mind that those deaths were not caused by starvation. Dysentery. It was chemicals that with our killing my people.

Speaker 2:          16:02          So we wanted to know, and this was an honest question, did he see something that would contradict the scientist story?

Speaker 4:          16:09          Did the source of the rain, was there always a plane and then rain plane and then rain or did sometimes the rain happen without a plane? [inaudible] [inaudible] we never saw what they said was that it was always just being dropped on them. And it will always, always be in drop where there are heavy concentrations of Hmong people. Hmm. But that's what we knew. We don't know whether there was a plane causing it. It was just you just see the dust or see the, you have to understand that the planes are shooting bullets and bombs every day, all the time. And so, so whether it was a bombing plane or a yellow plane was incredibly hard to distinguish. [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          16:57          everybody runs when you hear the plane. So mom, people don't watch bombs coming down. You came out, you sneak your head out and you watch what happened in the aftermath. You saw broken trees, you saw yellow in the, in the aftermath of what had been bombed. [inaudible] Ma [inaudible] I saw with my own eyes that [inaudible] on the leaves eating two holes with my own eyes. I saw Paul and that could kill the grass, could kill leaves, could kill trees, but he himself is not clear whether it's the bee stuff or whether it's other stuff, because there was so much stuff coming down from the sky. [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible] you know that, that, that were chemicals being that being used against the mall in the mountains of Laos, whether this is the chemicals from the bom or yellow rain chemicals were being used, it feels to him like this is a semantic debate and it feels like, um, there's a sad lack of justice that, that, that the word of a man who survived this thing must be pitted against a professor from Harvard who's read these accounts. Um, as far as I can tell,

Speaker 1:          18:07          your uncle didn't see the bee pollen fall. Your uncle didn't see a plane. All of this is hearsay.

Speaker 4:          18:23          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          18:23          What's your [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          18:27          my uncle says, um, for the last 20 years he didn't know that anything, anybody was interested in the death among people that you bargain. He agreed to do this interview because you were interested in to know what happened to them about what happened and the world has has been on interest for the last 20 years. He agreed because you were interested. She took a gay more attractive that the story would be hurt and at the moment that's who'd be documented and recognized. That's why you agreed to the interview that the moral heart is broken, that our leaders have been silenced and what we know has been questioned again and again. It's not a surprise to him or to me.

Speaker 7:          19:02          Okay.

Speaker 4:          19:04          I agreed to the interview for the same reason the radio lab was interested in the Hmong story that they were interested in, documented the dust that happened. There was so much that was not told. Everybody knows that chemical warfare was being used. How do you create bombs? If not what chemicals? We can play the semantics game. We can but I'm not interest in. My uncle is not interested. We have lost too much heart in too many people in the process.

Speaker 7:          19:30          What

Speaker 4:          19:33          I I think that, I think the interview is done.

Speaker 7:          19:37          Okay

Speaker 1:          19:54          now. Um, nope that wasn't the end of the interview. They kept on talking Robert and bad explained to Kalia that we know we're reporters. We're just trying to figure out what happened. One thing I do want to make clear, we informed the gangs in advance that we wanted to talk about the controversy surrounding yellow rain. We were very clear about that. We did not intend to ambush them, but this interview troubled us. We talked about it for months arguing back and forth about what it meant to the story, what it meant for us personally and uh, we decided at a certain point to bring that conversation into the studio. We're going to play you that conversation as we originally podcast and then we'll have some things to say on the other end.

Speaker 7:          20:40          Okay.

Speaker 1:          20:41          That started by a talking about the moment that you just heard on tape that somehow that

Speaker 11:         20:48          moment was when the whole story changed for me. How exactly like I think that there was something about like the way that she was pointing away from the thing that we had been looking so hard at and saying, stop looking at that. Look over here. Yeah. Like she like she didn't convince me at all that this wasn't a chemical weapon, but she convinced me that we were missing something. Yeah. What I'm hearing her say there,

Speaker 1:          21:22          not having been in this interview is quit focusing on this yellow rain stuff because when you do that, you're shoving aside the much larger story, namely that my people were being killed. Right. So you're what she's saying. So you're wrong.

Speaker 11:         21:36          That is absolutely into my mind. That is not fair to us. How is it not fair? It's not fair to ask us to not consider the other stories and the other frames of this story. The fact that the most powerful man in the world, Ronald Reagan used this story to order the manufacturer of chemical weapons for the first time in 20 years. If the United States with the manufacturer chemical weapons again and then use them because the Russians supposedly had, then people would have died. Ugly deaths in the consequence of that, and that is not unimportant. That's hugely important, but it's not important to her. So should that not be important to us, but I, yeah, I mean she's saying think that, I dunno. I, I think that until she, until she said the things that she said at the end of that interview, I don't think that I had fully appreciated the, the volume of pain that was involved in that moment for them. Yeah. Yes. I thought, I thought her reaction was very balancing, but her desire was not for balance. Her desire was to monopolize the story and that we can, sure. We can say that though. Oh, if you listen to the words, that's okay.

Speaker 1:          22:50          She said No. I just think that they feel like their trauma has never been fully acknowledged and that they've attached it to this because maybe they felt that they had to, they've attached it to this idea that yellow rain was a chemical weapon. And if yellow rain suddenly isn't a chemical weapon that doesn't just unvalidated the yellow rain, it negates their whole loss. And I think she might be right, but it's like, I also think that the scientists are right, it's not a chemical weapon. And I also think you're right that, to call it a chemical weapon has big consequences. So what do you do when three truths are right at the same time? This is where we stop.

Speaker 11:         23:33          So that was our original conversation and when the podcast went out, a lot of people were very upset by me in particular. So I think I want to, if I could add just a couple of things here. First of all, clearly it was wrong to say that Kalia Yang was trying to monopolize our conversation because after all, we are the editors. We choose what to put on the air. And in this case we chose, we were looking for evidence that despite what the scientists thought, that maybe there was a chemical weapon here and we wanted to find an eye witness to see if anybody saw a bomb open and yellow rain come out. That's what reporters do. We test truths. And that is why I was persistent. I had no idea what the youngs were going to say. And when they got angry, I was, I was embarrassed. And when I got angry in my conversation with Jed and pat, that was not right. And for that, I apologize to Kalia and Mr. Young in particular, I have to ask questions and search for truth. But in this case, given how much Mr Yangs had already suffered, I should have done it with more respect.
