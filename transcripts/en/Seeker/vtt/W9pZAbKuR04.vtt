00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.950
Look at these babies.

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.889
Oops, sorry.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.759
That was probably, NSFW.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.590
Hey there handymen and women, this is DNews,
I'm Trace.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.530
January 30, 1787, Thomas Jefferson wrote a
letter to James Madison, saying "I hold it

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.340
that a little rebellion now and then is a
good thing, and as necessary in the political

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.180
world as storms in the physical."

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.180
But by "rebellion," I don't think he meant
that candidates should "debate" by making

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.980
fun someone's hands, and by extension, their
sex organs.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.960
But even still, is there ANY correlation between
the male penis, and OTHER parts of the body?

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.440
Firstly, no.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440
Nope.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
No.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
None.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440
No.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.840
A study in the journal BJU International literally
looked at and systematically reviewed tens

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.280
of thousands of male members to finally deflate
any debate about our sizes.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.219
This any other studies have found average
penis sizes had no strong correlation with

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.370
testicular size, weight, or whatever.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.710
There is very shaky evidence linking digit
ratio of the second and fourth finger to hormonal

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.340
exposure in the womb, which may correlate
with penile proportions.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.399
The study was published in the Asian Journal
of Andrology in 2013.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.049
So, yes, this one small study of Korean men
says the ratio between two of your fingers

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.469
might be important…

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.549
Julian and Julia covered it here, but scientists
are skeptical.

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.070
But, you know what they say about men with
big feet though, right?

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.070
Big shoes.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.329
And that's about all you can infer in this
context.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.840
A study by London's St. Mary's Hospital and
University College Hospital of 104 men found

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.799
no correlation between their shoe size and
their penis size.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.409
So look, there's not really any strong, irrefutable,
repeated scientific evidence that visible

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.360
body parts, relate in any way to penis size.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.279
The average, by the way, is 3.6 inches (9.6cm)
flaccid and 5.2 inches erect (13.1cm).

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:45.759
If that seems small to you, assess why you
think so, and if the answer is the sex theater

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:47.579
of pornography, stop.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.469
The human male has the largest penis of any
primate in the animal kingdom, and only 5

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.329
in 100 men have an erect penis over 6.3 inches
(16cm).

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.609
And after all that, if you're worried about
penis size, welcome to the club.

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:03.899
Only a third of men surveyed were satisfied
with theirs according to a 2013 Journal of

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.200
Sexual Medicine paper.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.860
The researchers said most men surveyed had
issues with their height, weight and penis

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.230
size; their feelings on the matter were heavily
tied to self-esteem.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.150
In fact, the researchers found no matter the
size, some people just bratwurst braggarts

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.670
even those with a teeny weenie.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.650
Finally, women surveyed in a paper in Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences in 2013

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.010
found size is just one little factor in a
huge array of measures of attractiveness.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.209
Big dongs were related to attractiveness,
but small ones didn't hurt, the ladies honestly

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.240
just didn't care about it that much.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.340
As Science Magazine wrote, "To really reap
the benefits of a big penis, a guy needs to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.560
be attractive in the first place."

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.239
Also attractiveness aside, does the size of
pretty much ANYTHING under your clothes make

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.870
you a good or bad leader?

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.560
We are watching people vying for the most
powerful office in the U.S. verbally measuring,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.989
fat-shaming, and comparing hairstyles.

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.530
They're concentrating on appearance, and people
aren't laughing at them but with them.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.640
But even still, they're not alone, appearance
is something politicians worry about… for

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:31.489
example, why don't campaigning dudes have
beards anymore?
