00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
The thing is, every successful person you know

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.040
has failed at what they love to do, before.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.340
I've been unsuccessful in my career,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:11.400
you just didn't know about it,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.440
because I wasn't famous yet.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:13.400
And I was trying to be famous!

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.000
I was trying to get a record deal for six years!

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.600
And I kept getting turned down.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.000
Any successful person you know,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.200
even though it seems like

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.680
everything just happened for them,

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.040
it usually was preceded by a bunch of failure.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.000
Or at least a significant amount.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.700
But the great ones aren't the ones that don't fail,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:33.400
they're the ones that learn from their failure,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.420
and they keep going.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.940
And they're persistent, and they're tenacious.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.380
And for me,

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.280
I was trying to get a record deal from 1998 to 2004.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.760
And I got turned down by every major record label,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.740
including the one I'm signed to now.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.880
And for me that means that,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.140
even when you hear no,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.740
you have to keep going through all those no's,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.980
until you get to yes.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.120
And with learning something new,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.520
I think, it's the same principle.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.680
When I was younger, I didn't really know

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.940
that you could just get better at things.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.180
Because I think we're so used to that idea that

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.960
you're talented at something,

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.800
and it's sort of fixed, you know?

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:18.060
The idea that, "oh, he's just a good singer," you know.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.160
And even with singing, I've gotten better at singing.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.160
as I've gotten older.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.080
I wasn't singing in a way that was sustainable,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320
and I wasn't breathing right.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.320
I wasn't doing a bunch of things correctly.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.020
I realized that there was a ceiling that I couldn't crack through,

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.600
unless I actually studied,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.560
and worked under a coach to get better.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.900
And this idea that things are just fixed,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.060
is proven not to be the case.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.460
You can get better at things, you can grow.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.960
And even people that are innately talented

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.440
still need to go beyond that basic talent

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.940
that they have and cultivate it.
