00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:08.460
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hello.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.370
Thanks for coming today and
helping me welcome--

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.400
and I'm really hoping that
I get this right--

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.800
Dario Maestripieri to Google to
give us a talk on his new

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.550
book called "Games
Primates Play--

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.140
An Undercover Investigation of
the Evolution and Economics of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.500
Human Behavior." He's a
professor from the University

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.220
of Chicago of five different
things that

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.650
he said not to mention.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.850
But among them are comparative
human development and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.850
evolutionary biology.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.810
So he's an expert
in the field.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.320
So if you could just join me
in giving him a round of

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.125
applause to say welcome, thanks
for coming to Google.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.420
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: It's
a pleasure to be here.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.740
Can you hear me OK?

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.670
Great.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.690
In 1964, two important events
occurred-- at least,

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.410
important to me.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.360
First, I was born that year.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.550
And second, in 1964 is the year
in which this book was

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.320
published, "Games People Play."
In this book, which

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.910
went on to become a huge
bestseller, sold over 5

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:24.310
million copies, the author, a
psychiatrist named Eric Berne,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.230
argued that when people interact
with others in their

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.590
relationships, they do so
according to particular

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.160
patterns, particular rules
that typically result in

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.430
predictable outcomes.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.560
And so he had an explanation
as to why these rules exist

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.370
and why we play the games
that we play in social

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.460
relationships.

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.440
Well, in the almost 50 years
since this book was published,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.600
there's been a great deal of
progress in the science of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.860
human relationships.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.530
And I think there are
disciplines other than

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.510
psychology and psychiatry that
can help us understand why

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.940
people play the games that
they play in their

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.160
relationships.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.000
There are at least these three
disciplines that I think make

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.100
an important contribution.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.240
One is evolutionary biology.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.009
And that's because I think that
human nature is very much

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.199
expressed in our social
behavior.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:13.720
So I think that people have
biological predispositions to

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.960
act in certain ways towards
others, and that the genetic

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.760
basis and the neural,
physiological, cognitive,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.930
behavioral mechanisms that
control social behavior evolve

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.800
by natural selection.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.280
And natural selection tends to
produce behaviors that have

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.370
high benefit to cost ratios--

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.110
that is, behaviors that are
advantageous to the

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.690
individuals that exhibit these
behaviors and have

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.370
relatively low cost.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.410
Another discipline that I think
is helpful to understand

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.770
human relationships is
behavioral economics.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.780
Behavioral economists
assumed that

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.930
human behavior is rational--

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.030
that people behave in ways
that increase, again, the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.480
benefit to cost ratio, that we
behave in ways that increase

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.950
the benefits to ourselves
at a small cost.

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.760
The difference in the approaches
that economists

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.210
take versus evolutionary
biologists is that the

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.740
economists assume that rational
behavior is the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.220
product of a conscious choice,
that we think about the way we

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.990
want to behave and make these
conscious decisions.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.550
Whereas biologists don't assume
that all behavior is

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.270
the product of conscious
choice.

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:17.280
The idea is natural selection
essentially takes care of the

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.110
rationality aspect
of our behavior.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.770
So we behave in some occasions
unconsciously.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:25.520
The third discipline that
I think can help us is

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.430
primatology, which is the study
of the behavior of other

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.300
non-human primate species.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.950
And we need to know about this
because the same evolutionary

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.720
processes that shaped human
social behavior in some cases

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.630
have also shaped the behavior
of other primate species,

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.800
which means that there are
primate species in which

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.100
individuals play the
same games in their

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.910
relationships as we do.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.980
So what I do in my book is to
offer an overview of human

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.310
social relationships, discuss
some of their problems, and

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.000
some of the solutions
to these problems.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.750
So I began by discussing some
issues that arise when we

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.200
interact with strangers, for
example, in the elevator, or

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.990
lift, the way you call here.

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.650
Then, some issues relative to
interactions with family

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.270
members, and what happens when
we try to help our relatives

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.730
by behaving nepotistically.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.350
The way we deal with friends and
foes-- for example, when

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.610
it comes to issues of dominance
and power or

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:21.250
cooperation and competition.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.880
And finally, how we
deal with business

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.680
and romantic partners.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.430
So some of the problems that
arise in the cooperative

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.770
relationships that we establish
with particular

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:30.420
individuals.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.480
For example, I'll talk about
the commitment problem, and

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:36.480
the need in long-term
relationships to assess the

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.740
strength of the bond that we
have with our partner, and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.260
also the issue of how
to find an ideal

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:43.810
partner to begin with.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.400
And then I will conclude by
giving you some evolutionary

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.600
explanations as to why the
games that we play in our

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.970
relationships really were not
invented by human beings, but

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.670
can also be observed in
other animal species.

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.370
So let me begin by saying a
few things about why is it

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.240
that sometimes when we interact
with stranger in a

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.380
sort of harmless situation,
such as in the elevator,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.660
sometimes we unconsciously
perceive that there is some

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.560
danger there, that there is some
risk in that situation.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.137
I had the idea for the first
chapter of this book, and then

00:05:18.137 --> 00:05:21.050
for the whole book, when I lived
in a high-rise building

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.080
in Chicago a few years ago, the
transportation building.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.500
I lived in an apartment
on the 22nd floor.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.170
So every morning, I took the
lift to go down, and then to

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.760
go up at the end of the day.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.250
And every day, almost
inevitably, I met somebody new

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.070
that I didn't know, because
there's so many apartments in

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.920
this building.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.210
And as you all know because you
found yourself millions of

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.560
times in this situation,
sometimes, whether you're

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.340
alone with a strange or with
multiple people, you do

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.350
everything you possibly can to
avoid making direct eye-to-eye

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.980
contact, to behave in ways
that might be annoying to

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.990
others, to make loud noises.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.570
So you'll stare at the floor
or the ceiling or you will

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.380
check your watch even though
you already know

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.470
what time it is.

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.510
Sometimes you'll press a floor
button that's already been

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.460
pressed but you go ahead
and do it anyway.

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.890
Essentially, you don't want to
acknowledge the presence of

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:08.610
the other individual.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.770
You're a little uncomfortable
about this.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:14.750
So why is it that this
situation occurs?

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.090
Why is it that we have to face
these dilemmas in the elevator

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:21.700
between making or not making
eye contact, smiling or not

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.320
smiling, talking or not talking,
pressing or not

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.040
pressing a button that's already
been pressed, and what

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.030
to do, how not to reveal the
little tension that sometimes

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.880
we reveal through our
self-directed behavior-- we

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.120
scratch our heads a little
bit when we're nervous.

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.840
So why is it that we're
uncomfortable being in a

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.220
restricted space with
a stranger?

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.190
This is not a hot topic for
research by any stretch of the

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.420
imagination these days.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.720
But in the 1960s, it was.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.620
And an anthropologist named
Edward T. Hall wrote a book

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.940
called "The Hidden Dimension,"
in which he argued that people

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.920
have a personal space that is
analogous to an invisible

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.310
bubble that we carry around
ourselves everywhere we go,

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:02.975
and that we respond
to an invasion of

00:07:02.975 --> 00:07:03.850
this personal space.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.130
So when somebody gets
too close to

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.770
us, then we get defensive.

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.810
And he drew an analogy between
people's personal space and

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.240
animals' territories.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.150
So the idea is that when an
animal who has a territory,

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.850
this territory is invaded by a
stranger, the animal would

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.280
respond aggressively or try
to defend the territory.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.420
And so that was the explanation,
which I never

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.940
really found very convincing,
first of all, because I don't

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.440
think it's a real explanation.

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.010
It doesn't explain why there is
this bubble and why is that

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.240
we don't like having
this bubble

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.520
invaded by someone else.

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.750
It's simply a description of
what happens, but without

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:36.540
really explaining why
this happens.

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:40.020
So I have a different
explanation, and it's

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.480
illustrated here by
these two slides.

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.280
I don't know if some of you
remember this old movie from

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.570
the '80s directed by Brian De
Palma called "Dressed to

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:51.640
Kill," but in one of the most
famous scenes of the movie, a

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.910
character played by actress
Angie Dickinson is in the

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:57.230
elevator going up to
the seventh floor.

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.760
And the elevator door opens and
the killer, who's dressed

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:07.080
like a woman, wearing a wig and
sunglasses, slashes the

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.240
woman's face with
a razor blade.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.410
And so there are a lot of scenes
in horror movies in

00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.860
which people are murdered
in elevators.

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.420
I think it's the second most
common place for murders to

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:20.230
occur after the shower,
if you think about it.

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.100
So that's another cartoon that
sort of illustrates some of

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:26.440
the unconscious fears that we
might have if we ride in

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.540
elevators with strangers.

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.960
So I think that the real reason
why we act the way we

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:33.429
do is not that we're concerned
about our bubble being

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.539
invaded, but that our mind
unconsciously registers that

00:08:36.539 --> 00:08:39.600
there is a risk of aggression,
being so close to a stranger

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.580
in a situation where there's
no opportunity to escape if

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.530
there is a fight.

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.890
So for example, we don't make
eye contact, because in all

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.780
primate species, direct
eye contact is

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.040
perceived as a threat.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.860
So we consciously know this,
that if we stare at somebody

00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:56.250
in their eyes, they might
not like that.

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.320
And they might think that
we want to pick

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:57.950
a fight with them.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.060
And so we avoid that.

00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:05.290
So if we put two monkeys in a
cage who have not met before,

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:06.990
you see exactly the
same dynamics.

00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:09.980
You see the same elevator
behaviors.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:14.990
You see the same efforts to
try and act indifferent.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.920
Then there's things that
are unique to humans.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:19.510
So one thing that I've noticed
on my many elevator rides in

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:23.810
Chicago is that sometimes I
re-press a floor button, and

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:25.740
then a stranger walks into the
elevator and presses this

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:26.400
button again.

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.240
Why?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.900
Is it that the person did not
see that the button was

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.680
already lit?

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.860
That was not the case, because
I notice that they actually

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:36.360
look at the panel, they realize
the button is already

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:37.620
lit, but they press it again.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.480
Why?

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.520
Again, I think this has to do
with trying not to acknowledge

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.680
the presence of the
other person.

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.855
So if you see the button has
already been pressed, you're

00:09:47.855 --> 00:09:50.100
acknowledging there's somebody
there, he's pressed the

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:52.970
button, happens to be going
to the same floor as I am.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.620
So there's something
that links us.

00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:59.460
We even share goals.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:02.090
Animal researchers like to think
that sharing of goals is

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:05.980
a very important aspect of our
lives and behavior, something

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.930
that might be unique
to humans.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:10.770
So it might be the hallmark
of personhood.

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.110
And so it's just easier, if
you have to deal with a

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.560
potentially dangerous stranger,
not to acknowledge

00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.840
that this person is there, that
it's a real person has

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.010
goals, and that you connect
in some way.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.460
So it's just easier just to
ignore and just press the

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:23.500
button again.

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:25.030
And sometimes this happens.

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.680
So I mentioned that you can put
two monkeys in a cage and

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.890
observe some of the
same behavior.

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:31.310
And that's what I did when I
was a college student many

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.470
years ago at the University
of Rome in Italy.

00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:37.420
My very first experiment I
worked with nonhuman primates

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.442
was to put two monkeys
an a cage.

00:10:40.442 --> 00:10:43.770
I had many different
combinations of individuals,

00:10:43.770 --> 00:10:46.990
some of which had met before,
they were housed in the same

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:49.970
group, and others instead
who had not met before.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.590
So I let them be together in
this cage for an hour, I

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.900
recorded their behavior, and
I observed what happened.

00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.750
So in the pairs of monkeys that
had met before, they knew

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.980
each other, what happened was
that these monkeys very

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:03.980
quickly started grooming
each other.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.490
So they spent almost the entire
hour grooming each

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:10.020
other, which is an affiliative
behavior, it reduces tension.

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:13.110
So essentially, the monkeys
tried to deal with the

00:11:13.110 --> 00:11:16.570
awkwardness of the situation by
engaging in this behavior.

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:20.180
The pairs of monkeys in which
there was no previous

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:23.480
familiarity, initially they
showed a lot of elevator

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.850
behaviors, a lot of anxiety, a
lot of avoiding eye contact.

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:30.100
And then, two different
subgroups of pairs emerged.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.680
There was one subgroup of pairs
in which each monkey of

00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.560
the pair requested to be groomed
by the other monkey.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:39.050
And monkeys do this by showing
the part of the body that they

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:42.460
want to have groomed-- for
example, an arm or the back or

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.440
their body.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.360
But typically, the other
monkey would not start

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.200
grooming, instead would respond
to this request with

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:48.930
another request.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.390
So he said, no, I'm
not grooming you.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.370
You groom me.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:55.560
And they kept on rejecting these
advances from the other.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.920
And so there was very little
grooming going on the whole

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.500
hour because they kept on asking
each other to groom and

00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.720
kept on saying no, you do it.

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.450
You're turn.

00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.200
Whereas in other pairs, grooming
started very late in

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.090
the session.

00:12:08.090 --> 00:12:09.840
And eventually, when it started,
essentially one of

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.510
the two monkeys did
all the work.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.710
Those monkeys seemed very
concerned about the situation

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.830
and essentially accepted
to do most of the work.

00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:18.630
So initially, I couldn't make
any sense of these differences

00:12:18.630 --> 00:12:19.290
in behavior.

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.190
And then finally, I realized
that the monkeys were playing

00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:25.180
a game, which in economics and
game theory is called the

00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:28.640
prisoner's dilemma, which is
a way in which cooperative

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.010
interactions may or may not
occur when two individuals are

00:12:32.010 --> 00:12:33.730
put together in a situation
like this.

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:36.830
And I'm sure you're all familiar
with this model, but

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.380
for those of you who are not,
so it's a hypothetical

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:43.320
situation in which two men are
accused of the same crime and

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.530
they are interrogated by the
police independently in

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.170
separate rooms, where they
cannot communicate.

00:12:49.170 --> 00:12:51.490
And each person has
two options.

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:52.870
They can either confess--

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:55.240
they can say, I did it.I
committed the crime.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.270
This is called the cooperate
move Or they can accuse the

00:12:58.270 --> 00:13:00.590
other, which is called
the defect.

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.510
And the payoffs in this game are
the convictions that they

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:06.050
get depending on what they do.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:08.560
So the number of years of prison
sentence that they get.

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.640
So if they both defect, they
both get three years.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:17.870
If they both cooperate, they
both get one year in jail.

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:21.610
But what's interesting is what
happens if one person

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:23.600
cooperates and the
other defects.

00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:27.520
So the person who defects
actually walks away with no

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.480
sentence at all, whereas the one
who cooperates gets a very

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.400
heavy sentence, five
years in jail.

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:36.220
So as you can see from this
matrix, if you take the

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.630
perspective of player one,
you see that it's always

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:42.240
advantageous to defect not
knowing what the other person

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:46.760
will do, because if you defect
and the other cooperates, you

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.615
get zero years versus
one year, so

00:13:48.615 --> 00:13:49.960
it's better to defect.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.686
And if you defect and the other
defects, you get three

00:13:51.686 --> 00:13:52.760
years versus five.

00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.390
So not knowing what the other
will do, if you have certainty

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.880
that the other will cooperate,
you might choose to cooperate.

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.020
But not knowing, it always
pays to defect.

00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:04.640
This is what you do if
you interact with a

00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:05.840
stranger only once.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.700
But if interactions with the
same individuals are repeated,

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.440
then the best strategy's called
tit for tat, which is

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.420
that you simply do what the
other person has done in the

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.200
previous move.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:18.100
So if the other partner has
cooperated in the previous

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.180
move, you cooperate.

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.460
If they defected, you defect.

00:14:20.460 --> 00:14:23.910
And sort of keep track of
the previous moves.

00:14:23.910 --> 00:14:27.340
So these are some of the
problems that arise in

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:28.540
interaction with strangers.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.520
The main problem is that you
don't know what the stranger's

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:32.390
intentions are.

00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:35.870
You don't know whether they're
friendly or hostile.

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:38.700
The situation gets more
complicated if this encounter

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:41.950
with a stranger occurs in a
restricted space, and where

00:14:41.950 --> 00:14:43.480
the cost of aggression
will be high.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.110
If two monkeys get into a fight
in a small cage, there's

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.850
a good chance they'll get
seriously injured.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.420
The solution to this problem is
to develop these protective

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:53.390
behavioral strategies.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:58.730
So when cooperation is possible,
the solution to the

00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.535
problem depends on whether
you're interacting with the

00:15:01.535 --> 00:15:04.540
other individual only once,
in which case you

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.410
tend to behave selfishly.

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.980
If you interact repeatedly,
instead, tit for tat

00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:11.430
is the way to go.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:14.600
Now, these sorts of problems do
not occur when you interact

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:17.230
with people you know very well,
and especially with

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:20.270
family members, because you have
a shared interest with

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:21.020
these people.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.990
So there's all kinds of
different problems that arise

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.290
with family members.

00:15:26.290 --> 00:15:28.560
And one general problem with
relatives is that you

00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.510
have to help them.

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.870
Especially if you have children,
you want your

00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:33.730
children to be successful
in life.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:37.430
And so sometimes you end up
behaving nepotistically.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:39.260
What is nepotism?

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.180
Nepotism is widespread
in nature.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.040
Biologists are very
familiar with it.

00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.870
And to a biologist, nepotism
simply means to favor your

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.080
relative members at the expense
of non-relatives.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.320
There is no animal species on
this planet where individuals

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.880
favor non-relatives at the
expense of family members.

00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.910
So nepotism is a human
phenomenon.

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:04.300
This is a cartoon that sort of
illustrates the issues, where

00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:07.000
somebody's looking for a job and
the guy says, you've got a

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.860
great CV but you're not quite
what we look for, because they

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.270
look for the sons
of the owner.

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:14.640
And so there's a photo with
all the same face.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:15.960
That's what they're
looking for.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:21.230
So in preparing for writing for
this book, I came across

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:25.420
an interesting book written by
Adam Bellow, who happens to be

00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.590
the son of former University of
Chicago English professor

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:32.730
Saul Bellow, who was also
a Nobel Prize winner for

00:16:32.730 --> 00:16:33.690
literature.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:36.770
So his son Adam wrote a book
called "In Praise of

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.260
Nepotism," in which he made some
interesting claims, which

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:42.400
I try to summarize in the slide,
just to give you a gist

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.570
of what he says about
nepotism.

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:46.500
So let me read it very
quickly to you.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:48.520
He says, "Nepotism
is something we

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.100
can hardly do without.

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:52.300
For one thing, nepotistic
concern for the welfare of

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:55.250
children is the engine of
the capitalist system.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:57.940
Take that away and you destroy
the main incentives for

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.080
innovation and the creation
of wealth.

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.170
For another, meritocracy
unleavened by

00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:04.440
personal ties is inhumane.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.180
Finally, on the individual
level, nepotism is a

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.190
profoundly moral relationship,
one that transmits social and

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:12.710
cultural values and forms a
healthy bond between the

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:13.790
generations.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:17.470
In short, nepotism works, it
feels good, it is generally

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:18.680
the right thing to do.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.410
It has its origins in nature,
has played a vital role in

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:23.920
human social life, and boasts
a record of impressive

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.690
contributions to the progress
of civilization."

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:29.430
So that's an interesting
position to take.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:31.260
Obviously, I agree with some
of the statements here.

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:34.440
I agree that nepotism
has its origins in

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.140
nature, as I explained.

00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:39.920
But there is a big difference
between nepotism in animals

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.390
and nepotism in humans.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.370
So I wrote an article that was
published in a magazine in

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:46.930
which I elaborate on
this argument.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:49.080
And one of my chapters in
the book is about this.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.110
But just to make a long story
short, the difference between

00:17:54.110 --> 00:17:58.820
nepotism in animals and in
humans is that when animals

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.900
behave nepotistically to help
their family members, they

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.050
don't break any rules,
because there are no

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.240
rules in animal societies.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.080
There's no moral rules, there's
no societal rules,

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.310
cultural norms, there's
no laws.

00:18:09.310 --> 00:18:10.180
There's no right or wrong.

00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.290
There is no morality.

00:18:11.290 --> 00:18:13.870
Animals are amoral.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.160
Whereas in humans, the problem
with nepotism is not that we

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.680
help our relatives, but
it's how we help them.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:24.450
And almost inevitably, when we
help relatives, we end up

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.310
breaking some rules.

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:28.530
We end up breaking
some moral code.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.250
We end up breaking some laws,
some cultural norms, and in

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.140
some cases, we end up
committing crimes.

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:36.360
So there are people--

00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.670
dictators, for example-- who
will murder others in the

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.870
process of helping their
family members.

00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:46.200
So I sort of provide a very
alternative view of the

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.800
benefits and the problems with
nepotism in human societies

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.500
versus in animals.

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.770
Now let me switch gears a little
bit right now and talk

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:57.730
about how we deal with friends
and foes with regard to issues

00:18:57.730 --> 00:19:01.040
of dominance and power,
something that everybody has

00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.050
some interest in, I believe.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:07.560
So again, when I was writing
this book, one day, I happened

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:13.200
to think about the fact that
human beings have evolved

00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.710
essentially to interact face
to face with others.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.090
For much of our evolutionary
history, we had relationships

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.950
with people that we could see
directly, that we could hear,

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:24.010
and that we could touch.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.330
But these days, instead we
maintain social relationships

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:32.330
over email or over Facebook
or Google+, or whatever.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:35.170
So we maintain a relationship
with people that we can't see.

00:19:35.170 --> 00:19:38.070
So I wondered if this way of
maintaining relationships has

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:41.330
altered some fundamental
way the way we have our

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.635
relationships.

00:19:41.635 --> 00:19:45.300
And then I started thinking
about the dynamics, for

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.785
example, in which emails are
exchanged between people.

00:19:48.785 --> 00:19:51.460
I realized that no, even though
we use email, there's

00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:55.870
still some dynamics in these
email exchanges that remind us

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:57.890
of the way we used to deal with
relationships, and also

00:19:57.890 --> 00:19:59.800
the way other primates
deal with it.

00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.080
For example, if you think about
it, the way two people

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:04.910
exchange email messages with
one another, the way it

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:08.200
happens is that typically there
is an email conversation

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.140
with the messages going back
and forth which begins when

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.680
one person sends an email to
another one, typically asking

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:16.060
some questions or sharing some

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:17.750
information, making some requests.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.660
The receiver of the email thinks
about it then replies

00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:22.940
after a while, answering
the questions.

00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:24.560
And the first person writes
another email.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.060
There's some interval of time
between the email and the

00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.210
response, so the exchange goes
back and forth for a while.

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:32.380
And then at some point,
somebody doesn't reply

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:34.460
anymore, and that ends
the conversation.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:36.670
And then maybe there'll be
another conversation about a

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:39.350
few days later or months
or whatever.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.960
Well, if you think about it,
who starts the conversation

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:46.810
exchange, how long it takes to
reply, how long or short the

00:20:46.810 --> 00:20:49.300
replies are and who ends
the conversation.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.650
In my view, these are not
random phenomena.

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.310
There is a logic to it.

00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:56.530
And I think the logic has to do
with differences in status

00:20:56.530 --> 00:20:58.290
between the two individuals.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.720
In every relationship, there
is an individual who's

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.790
dominant, an individual
who's subordinate--

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:05.060
one of higher status and
one of lower status.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.890
And what this means is that
there are different

00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:08.660
benefits and costs.

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:12.030
So the person of lower status
has more to gain from the

00:21:12.030 --> 00:21:14.500
interaction, and so is more
willing to invest.

00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.490
The other one has less interest
in investing.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.760
To illustrate this point, let
me give you an example, a

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.500
hypothetical email exchange
between, say, a graduate

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:27.440
student named Jessica and her
advisor, Professor Smith.

00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.320
They're having an email exchange
which begins when

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.630
Jessica writes a long,
unsolicited email to Professor

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.230
Smith in which she asks a lot of
questions and requests some

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:37.510
information.

00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:39.800
Professor Smith sees the email,
he lets it sit for a

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:43.430
while, and then sends a short
reply answering all the

00:21:43.430 --> 00:21:45.560
questions, providing
all the information

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:47.240
that Jessica requested.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.155
Obviously, Jessica's very
encouraged by the fact that

00:21:49.155 --> 00:21:50.730
she got the reply
from her boss.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:54.630
And so immediately, she sends an
even longer email with more

00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.180
questions, more requests
for information.

00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.590
This time, Professor Smith waits
a little bit longer.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.730
He waits until the next day,
and then responds with an

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.170
email that is a little bit
shorter than the first one.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:08.780
But Jessica then writes
back and writes two

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.860
or three more emails.

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:14.320
Professor Smith replies later
and later, and with

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.920
increasingly short messages,
until after email number five

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.290
from Jessica, Professor Smith
lets this email sit

00:22:23.290 --> 00:22:25.330
indefinitely in his mailbox
and that's the end of the

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:26.450
conversation.

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.970
If I described the way two
chimpanzees groom each other,

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:31.730
you'll see that there's some
interesting similarities in

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:32.820
the dynamic.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.870
So the way grooming is
exchanged between two

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:38.140
chimpanzees is that the
subordinate individual

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.940
approaches the dominant and
starts grooming, does so for a

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:43.520
very long time, then stops
and asks for the

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.290
dominant to groom back.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:47.700
The dominant thinks about it for
a while, then grooms the

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:50.310
subordinate, but for a very
short bout, and then stops and

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:51.770
says, now, your turn again.

00:22:51.770 --> 00:22:54.700
And so the subordinate grooms
for a very long time again,

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.330
then stops and asks the
dominant to reply.

00:22:57.330 --> 00:22:59.960
The dominant this time waits
even longer, and his reply is

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.890
even shorter, and the grooming
goes back and forth until the

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.810
dominant simply gets
up and walks away.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:07.270
And that's the end of
the email exchange.

00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:08.920
So there's an interesting
similarity.

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.520
So nothing has changed
completely because of email as

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.070
a medium for communication.

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:19.910
But let me tell you about what
dominance is and why we should

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:20.470
care about it.

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.870
So I'll use a simple example
to illustrate a game theory

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:26.360
approach to dominance.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:31.580
Let's imagine that one day Yogi
Bear and Boo Boo Bear

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.780
meet in the middle of a forest
and find an apple.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:35.990
They're both hungry, they both
want the apple, the apple

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:38.090
cannot be shared.

00:23:38.090 --> 00:23:39.760
And so each bear has
two options.

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.290
They can either threaten the
other to escalate a fight to

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:43.230
get the apple--

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:45.350
that's called the hawk move--

00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.050
or they can let the other
bear get the apple.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:48.870
That's called the dove.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.610
Essentially, you behave
submissively.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:54.680
In this case, just to keep
things simple, let's assume

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.580
that if they have a fight,
each has a 50% chance of

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.300
winning the fight.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:02.450
In reality, the contests are
never symmetrical like this.

00:24:02.450 --> 00:24:04.620
But in this situation, there are
three possible outcomes,

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:08.580
three possible situations; one
in which both bears play hawk,

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:11.240
so there's a fight over the
apple; one in which they both

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.780
play dove, so there's
negotiation over who gets the

00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:17.210
apple; and the third situation
is one in which one plays hawk

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:18.690
and the other one plays dove.

00:24:18.690 --> 00:24:20.090
That's dominance.

00:24:20.090 --> 00:24:23.350
So dominance is a situation in
which a disagreement or a

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.240
conflict of interest is resolved
by one individual

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.493
acting aggressively,
threatening, to escalate a

00:24:28.493 --> 00:24:30.620
fight and the other one say,
OK, you can do it.

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:32.870
You can have your way.

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.190
Why does dominance occur?

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.980
Why does dominance exist?

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:41.000
Because it would be very
expensive in terms of energy

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.280
and time, and counterproductive
in many way,

00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.550
to resolve all disagreements
through fighting or

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:46.680
negotiation.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.100
Imagine how many times, those
of you who are married, you

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.530
disagree with your spouse over
what food you're going to eat

00:24:53.530 --> 00:24:55.650
at dinner or what TV channel
you're going to watch every

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.910
evening if you have to fight
over every disagreement, or if

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:01.530
you have to negotiate over who
decides this and that.

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:04.170
I think that this would be
a huge strain on your

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.250
relationship, with a lot of
negative consequences.

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:08.770
And that's why dominance
exists.

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:11.640
If there's one person who calls
the shots all the time,

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:15.410
essentially this makes things
easier, quicker, and saves

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:19.350
everybody a lot of stress.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:23.990
So dominance is a ubiquitous
phenomenon, a universal

00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:27.130
aspect, I think, of all
human relationships.

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:29.910
There's dominance between
parents and children.

00:25:29.910 --> 00:25:32.960
There's dominance between
siblings.

00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:36.560
Children fight to establish
dominance with their peers as

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.960
early as two years of age.

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.550
There's studies of kids on
playgrounds where they

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.560
establish dominance
with each other.

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.960
I think there is dominance
in romantic relationship.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.020
You can ask yourself whether
you or your partner is more

00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:49.320
dominant in your relationship,
who makes the decisions.

00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.510
And obviously, there is
dominance in the workplace.

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:54.560
There's dominance between
employers and employees.

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.960
And I want to talk a little
bit more about

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:56.920
this type of dominance.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.380
So imagine a company
such as this one.

00:26:00.380 --> 00:26:02.500
Every individual, every
employee, has a dominance

00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.800
relationship with every
other employee.

00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:09.700
The result of this is a
dominance hierarchy that looks

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:11.120
a little bit like this.

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.400
So there is somebody at the
top and other people of

00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.390
various levels, various
steps of the ladder.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:22.340
So suppose that you're
a new employee.

00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:23.940
You just joined this company.

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:26.510
Typically, you find yourself
sort of towards the bottom.

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:27.370
But you're ambitious.

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:28.480
You want to climb the ladder.

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.870
So how do you do it?

00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:33.660
How do you climb the ladder
in the workplace?

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:35.880
It turns out that there's
different ways to do it--

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:37.550
different strategies.

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:42.270
So I talk about these strategies
and illustrate them

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.530
with a hypothetical character.

00:26:44.530 --> 00:26:47.070
So the first strategy is
illustrated by a person I call

00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:48.630
the good citizen.

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:51.750
So this is a new employee who
joins the company and is very

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:56.020
friendly, very submissive, says
yes to all requests for

00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:58.350
work, attends all the business
meetings, never complaints

00:26:58.350 --> 00:27:01.720
about anything, never rocks
the boat, never asks for a

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.750
salary raise or promotion--

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:07.350
essentially, the strategy is
to be a good citizen and to

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:10.360
wait passively for things just
to take their course.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.840
And to hope that you will slowly
and gradually increase

00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:17.670
in rank through a seniority
system where eventually you

00:27:17.670 --> 00:27:20.820
are rewarded for your good
behavior by your bosses.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.830
Some people use this strategy
and it may work, but if you

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:26.150
happen to be the ambitious
type who wants to climb

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.910
quickly and maybe get at the top
sometime soon, I would not

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:29.705
recommend this strategy.

00:27:29.705 --> 00:27:32.255
At some point, you need to rock
the boat if you want to

00:27:32.255 --> 00:27:33.610
get up there.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:36.970
So then there's a second
strategy, illustrated by this

00:27:36.970 --> 00:27:38.850
individual I call
the young Turk.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.750
So this is a guy or a woman who
I said has no patience,

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.360
has no interest in playing
the good citizen.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.320
He wants to get up and
get there fast.

00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.360
And so he will challenge
the person on the top

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.700
almost on day one.

00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:52.990
So imagine that you're a
new employee at Google.

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.390
The first day you join the
company, in a business

00:27:55.390 --> 00:27:56.910
meeting, you say, I
have issues with

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.430
the CEO of this company.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.430
I have proof that he's, I don't
know, embezzled money,

00:28:01.430 --> 00:28:03.250
whatever, and I can
be a better boss.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.800
And see how that goes, whether
this strategy works.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.110
Essentially, it's
a coup d'etat.

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:09.600
It may or may not work,
depending on the

00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:10.600
circumstances.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.610
People who attempt this
typically are very

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:14.400
self-confident, very cocky.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.520
They obviously think
they have reasons

00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.730
why this might succeed.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:19.420
And it might under certain
circumstances.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.095
Then there's a third strategy,
illustrated by a character I

00:28:23.095 --> 00:28:25.090
call the Machiavellian
strategist.

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:27.940
So this new employee is somebody
who initially acts

00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.180
very nice to everybody, very
friendly, will establish

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:34.780
relationships with every other
employee in the company, will

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.000
take everybody out to lunch the
first month, but in the

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.710
meantime, will gather
information about the dynamic

00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.540
of power within the company.

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:45.290
So this person finds out who
has power and who doesn't,

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:49.620
who's going up and who's going
down on the hierarchy, who is

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.820
friends with whom, who's enemies
with whom, who's

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.120
sleeping with whom--

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.590
essentially, identifies a few
key players and establishes

00:28:56.590 --> 00:28:58.110
alliances with these
key players.

00:28:58.110 --> 00:29:00.690
And then after a while, when the
good opportunity presents

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:04.650
itself, using the base of
support that this person has

00:29:04.650 --> 00:29:07.000
built, eventually this person
will challenge the person at

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.470
the top and try to
take their place.

00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:12.890
So the interesting thing about
these strategies is that if

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.860
you study a particular kind
of monkeys, called macaque

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:18.670
monkeys, which I study.

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.750
These are Asian monkeys that
live in large groups.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.330
They have dominance
hierarchies,

00:29:22.330 --> 00:29:24.360
just like our own.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.020
If you study males in the
process of migrating to a new

00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:31.260
group-- so males leave the group
in which they're born

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:33.910
and join a new group when they
reach puberty, at about four

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:35.520
or five years of age.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.490
So they join this new group
where they don't know anybody,

00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.110
there's a well-established
dominance ladder, and

00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:42.130
obviously, these males would
like to get to the top and be

00:29:42.130 --> 00:29:44.100
the alpha male because there's
all kinds of benefits

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.240
associated with that.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:46.670
Well, they can do one
of three things.

00:29:46.670 --> 00:29:48.440
We happen to be equivalent
to what you

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.630
could do in a company.

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:53.420
So you can act as a good
citizen, what we call the

00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:54.930
"unobtrusive immigrant"--

00:29:54.930 --> 00:29:57.870
behave submissively, start at
the bottom of the hierarchy,

00:29:57.870 --> 00:30:00.880
and hope that gradually and
slowly, you will increase in

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:04.130
rank, essentially to a seniority
system, because the

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:06.230
older, more senior, more
dominant people eventually

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.250
will die or get sick or leave
the company, and you will

00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.340
essentially be rewarded
for your patience

00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:13.520
and your good behavior.

00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.280
Then there is the "challenge
immigrant," the guy who joins

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:19.720
the group and on day one picks
a fight with the alpha male,

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.260
challenges the alpha male--they
have a big fight.

00:30:21.260 --> 00:30:23.330
This is a young male,
typically, a very

00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:26.420
self-confident, strong, high
testosterone, risk taker.

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.620
In some cases, this
is successful.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.860
So he will defeat the alpha
male in a fight and will

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.770
become alpha in one day.

00:30:33.770 --> 00:30:35.400
And then there's the "challenger
resident"--

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.870
somebody who's a little more
Machiavellian, will join the

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:41.280
group, behave submissively
initially, establish

00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:44.010
relationships, gather
information, make alliances,

00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.630
and then one day, maybe a year
later, launch the challenge.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:49.200
So things are very similar.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.540
So the question is, why is it
that we see these three

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:52.380
different strategies?

00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:56.430
Why do they exist, and what's
the best strategy for you in

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:59.040
whatever situation you
find yourself to be.

00:30:59.040 --> 00:31:02.110
So there's theories in biology,
which also I use some

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:04.940
principle from economics, that
essentially tell you these

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:08.020
strategies exist and there's
pros and cons depending on the

00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.610
structure of power within
the organization.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.360
So in the figures there, that's
the power ladder.

00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.420
And it makes a difference how
this ladder is positioned,

00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:18.640
whether it's positioned sort of
against the wall sort of in

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.650
a gentle slope like that, almost
horizontal, or whether

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.142
it's almost vertical
like that, it's on

00:31:23.142 --> 00:31:24.760
a very steep slope.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.090
In the first case, essentially,
you find yourself

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:31.410
in a large organization where
this system of power is pretty

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:32.500
egalitarian.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:35.530
Power is distributed among
different people, not just in

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.060
the hands of one person at the
top, and there's a high degree

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:39.450
of social inertia.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:42.060
So in this situation, the
benefits of being right at the

00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:44.670
top are relatively low because,
as I said, power is

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:45.230
distributed.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:47.680
It's not all in the hands
of one person.

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.180
And the cost of attaining top
rank through a direct

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:50.780
challenge--

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.310
for example, of your CEO--

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:54.820
are potentially high because the
CEO has a lot of support.

00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:56.390
There's a lot of inertia.

00:31:56.390 --> 00:31:59.400
So the chance that you might
succeed in that are very low.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.910
So I recommend the "good
citizen," or, if you're a

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:04.780
monkey, the "unobtrusive
immigrant" strategy.

00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.300
But if you find yourself in a
different situation in which

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.250
there is a steeper
slope ladder--

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:12.590
the system is more despotic, the
power is concentrated in

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:15.150
the hands of one person or
a couple of people--

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.950
then the benefits of top rank
are very high, because it

00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:19.370
makes a big difference
being at the top.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:22.850
So there's high stakes in
challenging the leader.

00:32:22.850 --> 00:32:26.080
The cost of a direct challenge
might vary.

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.650
For example, in a small group
where the leader does not have

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:33.140
a strong base of support, it
pays to try an immediate

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:35.900
challenge because you have
higher chances of succeeding.

00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.580
So you might want to try
the "young Turk" or the

00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:39.860
"challenging immigrant"
strategy.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.370
Whereas in the larger group,
the cost is higher.

00:32:42.370 --> 00:32:44.300
So in both cases, the benefits
are very high because there's

00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.050
a lot at stake.

00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.970
But in the second case, the
costs are higher, and so it

00:32:47.970 --> 00:32:50.450
pays to wait a while, to gather
information, to build

00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:52.410
alliances, and then
to challenge.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:54.470
So you want to be a
Machiavellian strategist in

00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:55.650
this situation.

00:32:55.650 --> 00:32:57.870
So these are some of the things
that we can learn from

00:32:57.870 --> 00:33:01.880
evolutionary biology, from
economics, and from studying

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:03.440
other primate species.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.900
There's more we can learn
about relationships with

00:33:06.900 --> 00:33:09.920
friends and foes when it comes
to issues of cooperation and

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.130
competition.

00:33:11.130 --> 00:33:15.460
To illustrate this, I brought
a slide of my research

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.160
institute at the University
of Chicago.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:17.595
It's called the

00:33:17.595 --> 00:33:19.460
Biopsychological Science Building.

00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:21.460
And that's a colleague of
mine, Dr. Steve Shevell.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:22.980
He's a psychologist.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.640
He loves espresso, as I'm
sure many of you do.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:29.200
So he bought, years ago, a very
fancy espresso machine,

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.890
and runs an espresso club, which
means that people go

00:33:31.890 --> 00:33:34.460
there in the morning and
make their own coffee.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:38.010
And then they mark a paper sheet
on the wall reporting,

00:33:38.010 --> 00:33:40.530
essentially, how many cups of
coffee they've had that day.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.200
At the end of the month,
you count, and

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.860
people pay their bills.

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:44.590
So nobody checks.

00:33:44.590 --> 00:33:46.140
Nobody monitors.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:50.090
Somebody in the UK, at the
University of Newcastle, had a

00:33:50.090 --> 00:33:52.790
similar system where people
would make themselves coffee

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.240
and tea and then the put coins
in a box to pay for their

00:33:56.240 --> 00:33:57.280
coffee and tea.

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.350
So this psychologist did an
experiment where on a certain

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:05.350
week, he would put, or she put,
an image of flowers on

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:08.170
the file cabinet right above
the coffee maker.

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:09.550
And on the following
week, there'd be an

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.929
image of two eyes.

00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:12.480
And then these images
alternated.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:13.889
So one week there were
flowers, one

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:14.960
week there were eyes.

00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.860
And then they checked and
recorded how many coins people

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:17.710
put in the box.

00:34:17.710 --> 00:34:20.250
So you can see from that graph,
every week there were

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.827
eyes, people paid a lot
more for their coffee

00:34:22.827 --> 00:34:24.280
and for their tea.

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.820
So why is that?

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:28.060
Is that that people think that
somebody's watching, there's

00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:30.100
somebody hidden in the
cup over there

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:31.010
monitoring what they do?

00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:32.469
No, obviously not.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:36.260
But unconsciously, every time
we see eyes, we think that

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.920
there's some perception that
we're being watched.

00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:41.290
And when people perceive that
they're being watched, there's

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:43.880
a lot of studies that show
that they tend to be more

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:47.260
honest, more cooperative,
more generous.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.280
So there's studies showing, for
example, that if you take

00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:51.980
a computerized test with another
person in which you

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.909
can choose whether or not to
cooperate and the image on the

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:58.090
desktop, the background image,
has a pair of eyes like this--

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.730
and they don't even need
to look that human--

00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:03.180
so people tend to cooperate
more, tend to be more generous

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.880
and to be nicer if there's a
desktop image like this.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:10.030
And there's even a study that
showed a robot, this robot

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:12.890
built at MIT called Kismet,
that does not look like a

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:17.640
human being at all, but
has big, big eyes.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.160
And so when people see the
picture of the robot, they so,

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.610
oh, somebody's watching me.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:24.960
And so, for example, studies
have shown that people are

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.620
more likely to cooperate in a
prisoner's dilemma game or to

00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:31.780
contribute to the pool in public
goods game-- these are

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:34.860
experiments that economists
use--

00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:38.290
if their identity's revealed
than if they play anonymously.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.210
And also, it's well known that
people are more likely to

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:44.725
donate money to charities if the
identity's revealed and if

00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:47.040
the amount of their contribution
is acknowledged.

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.450
So why this happens is that if
you're being watched, or if

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:53.375
you think you're being watched,
unconsciously, there

00:35:53.375 --> 00:35:57.850
is a potential gain from
behaving yourself.

00:35:57.850 --> 00:36:01.940
So you establish a good
reputation, which could mean

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:03.370
good business in the future.

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:05.950
So people take notice
of who acts

00:36:05.950 --> 00:36:07.680
cooperatively and who doesn't.

00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:09.900
And if you don't behave yourself
while you're being

00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.490
watched, you might gain
a bad reputation.

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:15.720
And people sometimes go a great
length, and they're

00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.870
willing to invest a significant
amount of money,

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.000
to give somebody a
bad reputation.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.530
In this case, this was an angry
woman whose husband

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:24.840
probably cheated on her.

00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.560
And she obviously spent a lot of
money to put this billboard

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:31.500
out there essentially giving her
husband a bad reputation

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:34.480
and trying to prevent him from
finding mates in the future.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.820
So when you're in the

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.260
spotlight, it pays to cooperate.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.310
So if you're being watched,
the reputation benefits of

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:44.630
cooperation are high.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.970
The costs of cheating
are high too.

00:36:47.970 --> 00:36:51.320
But what if you know for a fact
that you're not being

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.730
watched, and nobody's
watching?

00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:56.250
What if you're operating in
conditions of anonymity or in

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:56.930
the darkness?

00:36:56.930 --> 00:37:00.570
In that case, the benefits of
being competitive might be

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.360
high, and the costs are low
because you think, or you

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.930
know, that you're not
going to get caught.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:09.890
So to illustrate that, I discuss
in my book the New

00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:13.160
York City power blackout
of 1977.

00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:18.480
So one day that year, a large
part of the city was left in

00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:22.250
the darkness for several hours
due to a lightning strike.

00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.510
And that night, hundreds
of people were

00:37:24.510 --> 00:37:27.070
mugged, raped, or murdered.

00:37:27.070 --> 00:37:29.600
Over 1,500 stores were looted.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:32.280
More than 500 police officers
were injured.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:35.180
More than 4,000 people
were arrested.

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:37.090
And many more probably committed
crimes that were not

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.290
arrested, were not caught.

00:37:38.290 --> 00:37:40.580
And most of these people had no
previous criminal record,

00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:42.790
so it's not like all the career
criminals committed

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.270
crimes and no one else did.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:47.740
This was the large mass
arrest in the

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.320
history of New York City.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:52.040
There is a proverb in Italy that
goes something like this,

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.310
[SPEAKING ITALIAN], which means
opportunity turns men

00:37:56.310 --> 00:37:58.000
into a thief.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:58.970
What does that mean?

00:37:58.970 --> 00:38:01.280
What's a good opportunity
for stealing?

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.510
It's one in which the benefits
are high and

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:04.850
the costs are low.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:06.820
If you know, or think, you're
not going to get caught,

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:09.040
that's a good opportunity
to be a thief.

00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:13.070
And so if you believe in this
proverb, you can think that

00:38:13.070 --> 00:38:15.770
essentially there are two
different ideas, or different

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:18.530
views, as to why there's police
officers out there

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:20.370
patrolling the streets.

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:23.050
Some people think that the world
is divided into good

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.810
people who never do anything
wrong and bad people.

00:38:25.810 --> 00:38:28.210
And the police officer out
there are essentially

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:30.550
protecting the good people
from the bad people.

00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:34.760
But there's another view,
which is that the police

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:37.480
officers are out there not to
protect the good people from

00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.750
the bad apples, but essentially,
to discourage

00:38:39.750 --> 00:38:43.430
everyone from committing crimes,
and to make sure that

00:38:43.430 --> 00:38:45.550
they're punished
if they do so.

00:38:45.550 --> 00:38:48.440
So the bottom line is that
people are sensitive in these

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.630
changes in benefit
to cost ratios.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.100
And whenever the benefits of
behaving selfishly are high

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:56.760
and the costs are low because
you don't get caught, then

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.420
people have a tendency to behave
in a more competitive,

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.580
more selfish way.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:04.240
There's another example I use
in my book of how anonymity

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:07.770
may promote competitive
impulses.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:11.750
And that is the way the peer
review process works in

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:14.330
academia, the fact that
professors and researchers

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:17.380
review each other's papers
and grant applications.

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.640
And in most cases, they
do this anonymously.

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.480
So when you review somebody's
paper, you know the author of

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:26.410
the paper, but they don't
know your identity.

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:28.790
So peer review is anonymous,
in general, to protect

00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:31.050
reviewers from the wrath
of rejected authors.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.050
So the idea is that if you
know the identity of the

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:35.510
person who rejected your grant
application or your paper,

00:39:35.510 --> 00:39:37.330
you're going to try
and retaliate.

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:40.950
That this occurs, there
is evidence of that.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.480
This is a well-known episode.

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:48.420
In February, 2010, a biology
professor in Alabama who was

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.290
denied tenure in her department
by her colleagues

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:53.580
shot to death three of them
in a faculty meeting.

00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:56.530
She went there with a rifle
and killed them all.

00:39:56.530 --> 00:39:59.425
So you can be angry if
you get rejected.

00:39:59.425 --> 00:40:02.750
But the question is, in this
system, who protects authors

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:04.260
from the anonymous reviewers?

00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:06.950
So the anonymous reviewers are
in a position in which they

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:09.010
can be competitive with authors
and get away with it

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.260
because their identity
is unknown.

00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.560
Does this really happen, or is
this just the product of my

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.660
paranoid imagination?

00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:17.340
It does happen.

00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.490
There are studies of the
anonymous peer review system

00:40:20.490 --> 00:40:23.400
that shows that manuscripts are
more likely to be accepted

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:25.820
when authors request that
competing researchers be

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.020
excluded as reviewers.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:30.010
So if you know who the potential
bad guys are and you

00:40:30.010 --> 00:40:32.670
tell them, I don't want these
people to review my stuff,

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:35.760
there's a better chance that
your paper will be accepted.

00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.750
Also, there's studies that have
compared single blind

00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.230
reviews, in which the author
is known and the reviewer's

00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:44.015
anonymous, and double blind
reviews, in which both author

00:40:44.015 --> 00:40:45.720
and reviewer are anonymous.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:48.680
It turns out that reviewers are
more likely to recommend

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.070
rejection of authors who are
women, who are colleagues from

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.500
a competing institution, or
citizens of another country in

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.840
single blind and double
blind reviews.

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.480
So when they know the identity
of the author, there's all

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.740
kinds of biases against
particular groups of people

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.480
that are expressed in
this situation.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:07.330
And I think anonymity plays
a role in this.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.990
There's also competition
between age cohorts.

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:14.500
I was once told by an NIH grant
officer that senior

00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:15.720
scientists sometimes
kill they're young.

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.860
They're not so nice
to younger people.

00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:20.280
There's competition between
different age groups.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.930
And there's also some sort of
tribal competition between

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.330
groups of researchers that work
with different topics and

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:27.070
different questions.

00:41:27.070 --> 00:41:28.400
So I'm a monkey researcher.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.470
I work with monkeys.

00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:32.890
When I apply for grants, I'm
terrified that my grant

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:35.690
application might be reviewed by
people who work with rats,

00:41:35.690 --> 00:41:38.060
because the rat people want to
exterminate all the monkey

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:41.340
people because they think that
our animals are cooler than

00:41:41.340 --> 00:41:44.470
theirs and so they want to
reject our application.

00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:46.950
So there is some of this
stuff going on.

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.440
The bottom line is that the
darkness, unfortunately,

00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.880
conditions of anonymity, tend
to favor competition because

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.150
the reputation benefits of
cooperation are low.

00:41:55.150 --> 00:41:57.050
If you behave yourself, you
don't get credit because your

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.710
identity is not known.

00:41:58.710 --> 00:42:00.590
Well, the costs of cheating are
low too, because you don't

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:01.970
get caught.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:05.510
So these are some issues
you need to consider.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:07.660
Let me say a little bit more
about some of the issues that

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:11.630
arise in cooperative
relationships with business or

00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:13.040
romantic partners.

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.470
So typically, when you
establish a long-term

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:18.730
relationship in which there's
some degree of cooperation,

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.630
whether it's business or
romantic, like marriage, at

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:24.580
the beginning, typically, the
benefits of the relationships

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:26.600
are greater than the costs
for both individuals.

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.670
Otherwise, why would you start
up that relationship, right?

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:31.120
Well, what happens
with time is that

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:32.990
circumstances often change.

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.910
And this benefit to cost ratio
might change for one of the

00:42:35.910 --> 00:42:38.805
two individuals, so that at some
point, the cost of being

00:42:38.805 --> 00:42:41.140
in that relationship become
greater than the benefits.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.080
So that individual for whom this
happens is tempted then

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:47.660
either to end the relationship
or to start cheating.

00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.320
So economists describe this
as the commitment problem.

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:54.800
How do you keep a cooperative
relationship together?

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:55.970
And there's reasons to
keep it together.

00:42:55.970 --> 00:42:57.460
For example, if it's a marriage,
there might be

00:42:57.460 --> 00:42:58.350
children involved.

00:42:58.350 --> 00:43:00.560
If it's a company, there might
be other employees that might

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.340
suffer from the break-up
and stuff like that.

00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:04.570
So how do you keep
it together?

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.820
How do you know that your
partner is committed?

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.500
How do you maintain this
commitment in spite of these

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.390
changes in benefit
to cost ratios?

00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:15.070
Because these changes
will happen.

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:18.700
And an American economist named
Bob Frank a few years

00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.720
ago published a book called
passions within reason, in

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:25.160
which he advanced this theory
about the evolution of

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:25.960
romantic love.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:30.190
He argued that romantic love
evolved to provide a solution

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.530
to the commitment problem
in romantic cooperative

00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:33.470
relationships.

00:43:33.470 --> 00:43:36.550
In other words, for two people
to stay together, he argued,

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:39.720
at some point, rational
decisions don't matter

00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.360
anymore, because these benefit
to cost ratio will change.

00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:44.480
So you need some irrational
feeling, you need some

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:47.160
irrational force that's going
to make you stick to your

00:43:47.160 --> 00:43:50.390
partner in the relationship,
regardless of the losses that

00:43:50.390 --> 00:43:52.610
you have and whatever
changes in these

00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:54.430
cost to benefit ratios.

00:43:54.430 --> 00:43:55.920
So here's this idea.

00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:59.010
So that's why we fall in love,
to make sure we maintain

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:01.890
commitment in spite of
cost and benefits.

00:44:01.890 --> 00:44:03.020
Is this really true?

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:09.490
Is this really true that this
view of love explains our

00:44:09.490 --> 00:44:11.940
knowledge of this phenomenon
in every situation?

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:12.770
How about this?

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:15.300
Does this view of love as a
solution to the commitment

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:18.260
problem explain Cyrano
de Bergerac?

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:20.430
You know the story
of this play.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.440
Cyrano is in love with
a woman who does not

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.450
reciprocate his love.

00:44:24.450 --> 00:44:27.160
In fact, she doesn't even know
that he's in love with her.

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.740
But he's in love with
her for years.

00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:31.850
And so obviously, love here
is not about maintaining

00:44:31.850 --> 00:44:32.400
commitment.

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.330
It's not about maintaining the
relationship, because they

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.350
don't even have a
relationship.

00:44:36.350 --> 00:44:40.060
So an important part of love
is really the longing for a

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:40.580
relationship.

00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:41.790
You want to be with somebody.

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:43.740
And whether you're actually with
this person or not, it

00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:46.660
doesn't really change the fact
that you love this person.

00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:51.670
So I think that the economist
theory does not apply to all

00:44:51.670 --> 00:44:53.180
situations in which
love occurs.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.570
And there's other issues that
I discuss in my book.

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:59.840
So here's a different theory
that I consider as to why love

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.420
has evolved, why is it that
people fall in love, which I

00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:03.970
think is pretty unique to
the species, actually.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.710
There's no equivalent of
romantic love in others.

00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:08.190
To understand the function of
love, I think you have to

00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:10.390
think about the function
of emotions.

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:11.600
Love is an emotion.

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.100
And the function of emotions
in general are to energize

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:15.460
motivation.

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.510
So if you feel a strong positive
or negative emotion,

00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:20.800
that's going to make you want
to do something, or make you

00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.620
want to avoid something a lot
more than if this emotion was

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.240
not present.

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:27.500
So emotions energize
motivation.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.210
And so one possibility is that
love evolved essentially to

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:33.920
motivate men and women to get
together, to reproduce, and

00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.550
stay together at least as long
as it takes to raise one or

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:40.300
more children to make sure
that they survive.

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.050
So you're all familiar with this
old movie "The Seven Year

00:45:43.050 --> 00:45:47.650
Itch." The title comes from some
divorce data back in the

00:45:47.650 --> 00:45:50.910
'70s suggesting that most
couples who divorce do so

00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:52.880
after seven years.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.800
Most recent data suggests that
it's actually four years.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.340
And there's interesting
research done by

00:45:57.340 --> 00:46:00.700
anthropologists to suggest
that in non-industrial

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.710
societies, typically a woman has
a child every four years.

00:46:04.710 --> 00:46:08.380
So women breast feed their
children for four years.

00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.660
And so after four years, when
the child is actually--

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.890
has a pretty good chance that
he will survive or she will

00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.930
survive, because the first
couple of years are really

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:19.440
risky in terms of infant
survival, then that woman will

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:23.250
move on and have another child
or maybe split up.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:28.150
So the idea is that it takes two
parents to raise a child

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:29.190
successfully.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:32.240
And so when two people get
together and stay together--

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:36.195
if love didn't exist, if there
was only sex, I think people

00:46:36.195 --> 00:46:37.730
would still have sex, but I
don't think that they would

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:39.500
spend much time together.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.580
So the best illustration of this
principle that love is an

00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.540
energizer--

00:46:43.540 --> 00:46:46.560
I found this monologue from one
of my favorite radio show

00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:48.290
hosts, Joe Frank.

00:46:48.290 --> 00:46:51.230
He's based in Los Angeles,
has a radio show.

00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:54.350
This is taken from his "Love
Prisoner" monologue.

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:55.450
You can read it for yourself.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.750
It sort of really speaks to this
notion that when you fall

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:02.145
in love, it generates so much
energy, you're willing to do

00:47:02.145 --> 00:47:02.840
all kinds of things.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.940
And that motivates you to
establish and maintain this

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.170
relationship.

00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:08.760
So what about the commitment
problem?

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.860
If love is not the solution to
the commitment problem, how do

00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.440
we solve the commitment
problem?

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.050
Well, here's how baboons have
come up with a solution to the

00:47:17.050 --> 00:47:20.980
commitment problems In baboons,
two males form a

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:24.000
political alliance where they
help each other in fights.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.660
So when one baboon gets into a
fight with another, his ally

00:47:26.660 --> 00:47:28.280
will intervene and help him.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:30.380
So these alliances
can be long-term.

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:31.890
They're cooperative
relationships.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.630
And every now and then, the two
baboons need to figure out

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:35.320
whether the other male is
still committed to the

00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.270
relationship, whether they
can be trusted or not.

00:47:37.270 --> 00:47:41.440
So what they do to check the
commitment is they get

00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:44.340
together and they fondle
each other's genitalia.

00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.870
They briefly handle the other
baboon's testicles.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.750
It turns out that the word
"testify" comes from the Latin

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:53.750
word "testes," which means
"testicle," because in ancient

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:56.900
Rome, two men who made a pledge
of allegiance would

00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:58.550
hold each other's testicles.

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:00.370
And a man would hold his
own testicles while

00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:01.310
testifying in court.

00:48:01.310 --> 00:48:02.860
And that's where the
word comes from.

00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:04.700
So why do the baboons do
this and why do the

00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:06.220
ancient Romans do this?

00:48:06.220 --> 00:48:09.770
Well, the idea is that if
you're in a cooperative

00:48:09.770 --> 00:48:13.940
relationship, you need to test
the strength of the other

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:15.280
person's commitment.

00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:17.460
And there's weak ways and
strong ways to do this.

00:48:17.460 --> 00:48:19.890
If you're in a romantic
relationship, you can ask your

00:48:19.890 --> 00:48:21.840
partner, do you still love me?

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.690
Are you sure you still
want to be with me?

00:48:23.690 --> 00:48:26.520
And that can be a fine
way to test.

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:29.810
But sometimes people are not
good with words and they say

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:31.420
things they don't mean, or
sometimes they don't even know

00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.010
what their real feelings are.

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:36.950
So research in biology suggests
that a stronger test

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:40.640
instead involves behaving in
ways that are risky, that are

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.950
dangerous, that are physically
intrusive--

00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:46.300
essentially, in ways that raise
a cost of the other

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:46.910
individual.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:48.450
And then you wait
for a reaction.

00:48:48.450 --> 00:48:50.730
If the other individual is
willing to pay that cost, is

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:52.890
going to be patient and tolerate
your intrusion or

00:48:52.890 --> 00:48:55.870
your annoying behavior, then it
means they're committed to

00:48:55.870 --> 00:48:56.700
the relationship.

00:48:56.700 --> 00:48:59.830
And you can have reason to relax
about the relationship.

00:48:59.830 --> 00:49:03.920
If they're intolerant,
then it's bad news.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:07.270
So the idea here is that the
best way to assess how much an

00:49:07.270 --> 00:49:10.640
individual values your
relationship is to see what

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.250
kind of price they're
willing to pay.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:14.880
It's a basic principle
from economics.

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:17.120
So that's called The
Handicap Principle.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.730
And the person who advanced this
theory also argued that

00:49:19.730 --> 00:49:22.870
it's not a coincidence, not an
accident that many expressions

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:25.490
of love and affection in
humans seem to have

00:49:25.490 --> 00:49:27.580
stress-inducing elements.

00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:31.120
If you think about it, why is
it that lovers, for example,

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.340
French kiss?

00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:34.575
Why French kissing as opposed
to-- if you think about it,

00:49:34.575 --> 00:49:37.380
it's a pretty intrusive,
invasive kind of thing.

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.520
You would agree to French kiss
somebody only if you really

00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:42.690
love this person or you're
committed to the relationship.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:44.260
And there's other elements--

00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.880
he obviously has some ideas
about sex, also, being

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.190
intrusive and stressful.

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.760
And you might disagree
with that.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:54.350
But the general idea is that
you impose a cost and see

00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:56.625
whether the other individual is
willing to pay this cost.

00:49:56.625 --> 00:50:00.130
So for the baboons, obviously,
having somebody come and touch

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:02.580
your testicles, very
risky business.

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:06.160
This baboon could put you out of
business in five seconds if

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.360
they have bad intentions.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.500
And the baboon who does this
also is taking a big risk,

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:13.410
because you saw the size of the
canines of the baboons.

00:50:13.410 --> 00:50:15.640
You could get bitten in the head
and be out of business.

00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.270
So there's risk-taking
on both sides.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.840
And there has to be a lot of
trust involved in this test of

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.670
this relationship.

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:26.130
So what biology and economics
tell us is that if you find

00:50:26.130 --> 00:50:28.800
yourself in a long-term
cooperative relationship, you

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.460
must do all these things.

00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.790
You must find out how your
partner behaved in previous

00:50:32.790 --> 00:50:33.370
relationships--

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:35.610
so gather information about
previous behavior.

00:50:35.610 --> 00:50:38.030
You have to monitor his or her
every move and play tit for

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:40.350
tat, like the prisoner's
dilemma.

00:50:40.350 --> 00:50:42.840
You have to provide incentives
and rewards for cooperation as

00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:45.610
well as discouragement and
punishment for cheating.

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:47.630
You have to use any means
at your disposal--

00:50:47.630 --> 00:50:50.010
including feelings, morality,
religion, and the legal

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:52.140
system-- to make your
partner behave.

00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:54.460
And finally, you have to check
the strength of his or her

00:50:54.460 --> 00:50:57.060
commitment with bizarre, risky,
annoying, or sexually

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.530
daring behaviors on
a daily basis.

00:50:59.530 --> 00:51:02.630
But the bad news is that,
despite all of these

00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:04.980
precautions, a cooperative
relationship between two

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:07.000
individuals might
still go wrong.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.450
And the simple reason for that
might be that you picked the

00:51:09.450 --> 00:51:11.770
wrong person to begin with.

00:51:11.770 --> 00:51:13.780
So how do you know if you picked
the right person or the

00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.980
wrong person for you?

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:18.710
Well, typically, the way people
pick their partners

00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:21.370
occurs in the context
of a market.

00:51:21.370 --> 00:51:24.830
So we all operate in mating
markets, or marriage markets.

00:51:24.830 --> 00:51:28.020
And the idea of the market is
that men and women have

00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:31.200
different announcements that
members of the sex find more

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.440
or less appealing
or attractive.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.830
In the case of men, women tend
to care about a slightly older

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:39.450
age, high physical
attractiveness, wealth, power,

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:42.210
high social celebrity status,
and so on and so forth.

00:51:42.210 --> 00:51:46.070
Whereas men care about younger
age in women, physical

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:47.260
attractiveness, et cetera.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:49.550
There's all kinds
of other things.

00:51:49.550 --> 00:51:51.630
In a market, there's the laws
of supply and demand.

00:51:51.630 --> 00:51:54.410
There are a few individuals that
have the endowments that

00:51:54.410 --> 00:51:57.180
make them appealing, and
many others who don't.

00:51:57.180 --> 00:51:59.820
So there's people like Angelina
Jolie and George

00:51:59.820 --> 00:52:02.430
Clooney who are in very high
demand-- everybody wants

00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:04.200
people like that as
their partners--

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.610
but in very low supply.

00:52:05.610 --> 00:52:08.410
So the laws of the market are
such that individuals in that

00:52:08.410 --> 00:52:11.020
situation can pretty much
pick and choose any

00:52:11.020 --> 00:52:12.050
partner they want.

00:52:12.050 --> 00:52:13.130
And they seem to do that.

00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:15.270
So these are the partners
that they chose.

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.120
Although, I hear that George
Clooney has already moved on

00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:19.785
and changed his mind,
and looking for

00:52:19.785 --> 00:52:22.350
a new partner already.

00:52:22.350 --> 00:52:24.870
And there's other ways in which
couples are matched for

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:25.460
endowments.

00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:28.730
So this is an example of a
couple where individuals might

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:32.020
be matched in looks,
personality, social status.

00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.370
That's another celebrity
couple.

00:52:33.370 --> 00:52:36.730
I don't know how many of you
know Flavio Briatore, an

00:52:36.730 --> 00:52:40.090
Italian Formula One
businessman.

00:52:40.090 --> 00:52:41.840
The couple is matched because
even though he's not as

00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.320
attractive as his wife,
he's got a lot of

00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.660
money, celebrity status.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:46.760
And so there's good matching.

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.070
And so the idea is that this
matching occurs in the market.

00:52:52.070 --> 00:52:55.730
Whether or not people like it
or they want it, it's the

00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:59.080
result of the market, the fact
that individuals differ in

00:52:59.080 --> 00:53:02.170
these endowments, that there is
competition for people with

00:53:02.170 --> 00:53:04.930
high endowments, and that there
is the laws of supply

00:53:04.930 --> 00:53:05.740
and demand.

00:53:05.740 --> 00:53:08.850
So good matching is a
good thing for you.

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:10.120
It makes couple more stable.

00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.470
It makes it unlikely that the
relationship is associated

00:53:12.470 --> 00:53:15.670
with different cost/benefit
ratios for the two partners,

00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:18.900
and that might lead to one
partner to cheat or end the

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:19.770
relationship.

00:53:19.770 --> 00:53:22.260
So how do you know where you
stand in the mating market,

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:23.660
what's your mate value is.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.830
People pretty much figure out
the value of their endowments

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:29.410
with experience, with feedback
from other people,

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.980
particularly during adolescence,
and usually end

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:36.470
up pairing with an individual
who has similar value.

00:53:36.470 --> 00:53:40.240
A human mating market is by no
means unique to our species.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.010
There's mating markets
like this in birds,

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:44.690
other mammals, primates.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:46.350
And they're not all about sex.

00:53:46.350 --> 00:53:49.680
There are markets about other
things-- for example, in fish,

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:54.490
there is a species of large fish
that needs smaller fish

00:53:54.490 --> 00:53:56.910
to swim inside their mouth and
clean their mouths from

00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.025
parasites and other things.

00:53:58.025 --> 00:54:00.860
These are called the cleaner
and the client.

00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:04.590
So studies have shown that how
each fish chooses a partner

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.580
for this thing, it's a complex
operation that essentially

00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:08.450
involves a market.

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:10.850
There are some cleaners, they
have very high endowments.

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:11.705
They have a good reputation.

00:54:11.705 --> 00:54:12.790
They do a good job.

00:54:12.790 --> 00:54:13.810
They don't cheat.

00:54:13.810 --> 00:54:16.680
There are [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.452
instead who are nice, others
who end up swallowing the

00:54:19.452 --> 00:54:21.740
little fish instead, so they
have a bad reputation.

00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:24.720
So the way these fish pick and
choose one another, it's

00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.890
really regulated by the
laws of the market.

00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:30.060
So let me wrap this up now and
tell you why is it that we see

00:54:30.060 --> 00:54:32.750
all these similarities between
humans and other species and

00:54:32.750 --> 00:54:33.960
these games that we play.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:35.490
There's two processes that
account for these

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:36.380
similarities.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:39.090
One is called convergent
evolution, the idea that

00:54:39.090 --> 00:54:42.000
organisms dealing with similar
social problems come up with

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.410
similar solutions
independently.

00:54:44.410 --> 00:54:47.190
And I mentioned some of
these situations--

00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:49.630
elevator effects,
market dynamics,

00:54:49.630 --> 00:54:51.440
cooperation, nepotism.

00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.630
The other phenomenon is called
phylogenetic inheritance, the

00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:57.350
idea that two species that are
closely related might be

00:54:57.350 --> 00:55:00.010
similar in their behavior
because they inherit these

00:55:00.010 --> 00:55:01.740
behaviors from a common
ancestor.

00:55:01.740 --> 00:55:03.640
So for example, chimpanzees and

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.360
humans are closely related.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.980
We're very similar in some
behaviors because we inherited

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:10.270
these behaviors from an ancestor
that we share with

00:55:10.270 --> 00:55:12.990
chimpanzees about 5 to
6 million years ago.

00:55:12.990 --> 00:55:16.000
It's difficult to demonstrate
the inheritance of

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.780
behavior like this.

00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:20.350
But they say a picture's worth a
thousand words, so here's my

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:21.320
contribution.

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:23.540
This shows that even the most
beautiful human smile has a

00:55:23.540 --> 00:55:24.960
long evolutionary history.

00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:27.520
That's a smile in a rhesus
monkey and a chimpanzee, and

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:28.910
that happens to be my wife.

00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:30.160
Thanks for your attention.

00:55:38.245 --> 00:55:40.590
And if you have any questions,
I'll be happy to

00:55:40.590 --> 00:55:41.840
try to answer them.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.480
AUDIENCE: I have one.

00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:49.230
I have loads, actually.

00:55:49.230 --> 00:55:52.540
But I'll try to stick to one.

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:54.600
I was interested in what you
said about dominance and

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.900
subordination.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.050
And your explanation for
dominance is that it just

00:55:58.050 --> 00:55:59.870
makes life easier in general--

00:55:59.870 --> 00:56:02.260
faster and more efficient
things happen.

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:06.360
And then I was thinking about
how we're kind of product up

00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:11.740
with values that tell us that,
well, democracy is right and

00:56:11.740 --> 00:56:13.180
equality is right.

00:56:13.180 --> 00:56:16.090
And you need to take in
everyone's views and then

00:56:16.090 --> 00:56:17.340
figure out what's best
for everyone.

00:56:17.340 --> 00:56:20.680
So that kind of seems completely
contrary to what

00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:23.320
you've just said is kind of
the natural way, or the

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.850
biological inherited way.

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.130
So I'm just wondering what
your thoughts are.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:30.750
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: Well, I
guess I mentioned, I think

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:35.600
dominance is sort of an
intrinsic aspect of every

00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.520
dyadic relationship.

00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.650
Between two people, it's almost
inevitable that things

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:41.920
can't be exactly on a level
of balance and equality.

00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:45.220
On a larger scale in a society,
obviously, there's

00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:48.480
different degrees in terms of
how power is handled-- so

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:51.010
there's despotic systems, which,
obviously dominance is

00:56:51.010 --> 00:56:52.440
right there in your face.

00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.830
So there's despots who use and
abuse their power and systems

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:58.250
that are more egalitarian
and democratic.

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:00.200
But that doesn't mean that
in these egalitarian and

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.720
democratic systems there's
no dominance.

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.810
Obviously, there's people
with power and

00:57:03.810 --> 00:57:04.860
people with less power.

00:57:04.860 --> 00:57:07.530
And having or not having power
is associated with all kinds

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:09.400
of benefits and perks
and resources,

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:10.560
and things like that.

00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:13.120
So it's really an inevitable--

00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:16.920
I mean, communism tried to
eliminate distinctions of

00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:20.170
power, and we know how
well that worked.

00:57:20.170 --> 00:57:25.160
So I think it's better to
understand that the tendency

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:28.610
to be dominant is almost a
universal aspect of animal

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.230
behavior, including
human behavior.

00:57:30.230 --> 00:57:32.580
Which doesn't make it
necessarily a good thing.

00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.840
So it's not like, oh, it's
good to be dominant.

00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.380
One thing that people can
realize is that if you happen

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:40.280
to be in a dominant position at
work or at home, dominance

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.710
comes with responsibility.

00:57:41.710 --> 00:57:44.700
So the fact that you have the
potential to make decisions

00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:48.500
means that you need to do it
nicely, in a way that takes

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.820
into account the needs and the
rights of other people.

00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:55.330
So there is a sort of a gentle,
kinder aspect to

00:57:55.330 --> 00:57:58.260
dominance which is an
opportunity if you happen to--

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:00.160
you also have an opportunity
to lead.

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.980
And if you have the ability
and the resources to lead,

00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.620
then there's nothing wrong
with that, right?

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:07.008
AUDIENCE: Are you kind of
saying that despite our

00:58:07.008 --> 00:58:11.150
highest ideals that we're kind
of programmed to fall into

00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:12.800
those patterns of--?

00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:13.900
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: Well,
ask yourself.

00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:17.740
Usually, say, if I ask you to
think about 100 different

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:19.940
relationships that you have with
people you know, starting

00:58:19.940 --> 00:58:23.230
with your family members, your
friends, and ask you to think

00:58:23.230 --> 00:58:25.820
whether you think you're
dominant or subordinate in

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:27.990
each one of these relationships,
my guess is

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:29.830
that you can give me
a good answer in at

00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:31.720
least 95% of the cases.

00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:34.410
I think if you think about it,
in 95% of your relationship,

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.440
you have a pretty good idea
whether you're the one who

00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:38.050
calls the shots or
not so much.

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:40.290
There might be 5% where
things are unclear.

00:58:40.290 --> 00:58:42.330
So does that mean dominance
is universal?

00:58:42.330 --> 00:58:45.496
I think it's pretty
pervasive, yeah.

00:58:45.496 --> 00:58:46.746
Yeah?

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:56.180
AUDIENCE: Can I just follow
on from that?

00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:00.180
It seems to me there's another
big factor beyond dominance

00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.700
and cooperation and negotiation
which also is

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.030
quite low cost, which is just
agreeing that you'll have

00:59:06.030 --> 00:59:07.740
certain customs and patterns.

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:09.530
That's how my relationship
works with my wife.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:12.720
There are lots of things that we
need to do which has a cost

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:14.150
to each of us, whoever
does it.

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:16.450
But we've just agreed that one
of us will do one, generally,

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.230
and the other will
do the other.

00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.790
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI:
That's great.

00:59:18.790 --> 00:59:22.640
There is division of labor and
there is ways to cooperate in

00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.180
a way that is complementary.

00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:27.770
But still, in every long-term
cooperative relationship,

00:59:27.770 --> 00:59:30.540
there is always the potential
for disagreements.

00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:34.010
No matter how good, how strong
your relationship is, you end

00:59:34.010 --> 00:59:37.660
up disagreeing over a number of
small issues, big issues on

00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:39.300
a daily basis.

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.110
And this is not just
in humans.

00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:44.700
It happens in many species
of primates.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.350
Aggression and fighting is most
common between closely

00:59:47.350 --> 00:59:48.610
related individuals--

00:59:48.610 --> 00:59:52.120
pairs of siblings, mothers and
daughters, males and females

00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:53.400
who associate frequently.

00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:55.870
They fight with each
other all the time.

00:59:55.870 --> 00:59:59.080
The most frequent crimes are
committed in pairs of people

00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:00.150
who know each other well.

01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:01.750
So it's not that you go out
and kill strangers.

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.480
You go and kill your wife or
your child, stuff like that.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.590
So your relationship can
be-- the point I'm

01:00:06.590 --> 01:00:07.670
trying to make is--

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.340
I'm not trying to sell
some pessimistic

01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:11.190
view of human nature.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:14.110
But it's that its intrinsic to
the notion that if you're in a

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:16.900
long-term relationship with
somebody, there's many

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:21.120
opportunities for disagreeing
about the way you do things.

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.840
And fighting all the time, or
negotiating all the time,

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.490
every single time, it's
just not productive.

01:00:27.490 --> 01:00:28.620
It's not cost effective.

01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:29.770
It's stressful.

01:00:29.770 --> 01:00:31.330
It's expensive energetically.

01:00:31.330 --> 01:00:34.460
It might damage your
relationship.

01:00:34.460 --> 01:00:36.230
It's not nice to negotiate
all the time.

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:39.480
Sometimes it's nice to make
a decision and go on.

01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.940
And move on.

01:00:41.940 --> 01:00:44.770
AUDIENCE: Actually, it's similar
to what you're saying.

01:00:44.770 --> 01:00:48.530
Just thinking about lots of
different relationships, it

01:00:48.530 --> 01:00:53.400
strikes me as the dominance
interplay actually varies

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.260
depending on what the topic
happens to be that they're

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:56.210
discussing.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:01:01.520
So it's not like husband/wife,
employer/employee, the

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.400
dominant person's always the
same person throughout.

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:10.110
So I didn't see much
coming out--

01:01:10.110 --> 01:01:11.260
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: Dominance
is more complex than,

01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:13.810
obviously, the way
I presented it.

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:16.140
So dominance, first of all,
is a characteristic of a

01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.170
relationship, not a
characteristic of an

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:19.050
individual.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.040
Which means that you can be
dominant in one relationship

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:21.995
but subordinate in another.

01:01:21.995 --> 01:01:24.670
It depends on the relationship,
not on you.

01:01:24.670 --> 01:01:27.480
But it's also that there are
individuals who tend to act

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:30.150
dominant, and to be dominant
in many relationships, and

01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:31.760
others instead who are
dominant in very few

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:32.980
relationships.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.890
In some cases, dominance is
independent of context, which

01:01:36.890 --> 01:01:39.030
means that if you're dominant
in a relationship,

01:01:39.030 --> 01:01:39.830
you call the shots.

01:01:39.830 --> 01:01:42.070
You make decisions in every
single context.

01:01:42.070 --> 01:01:46.080
In some cases, dominance is
context dependent, which means

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:49.340
that you make decisions about
one domain and the other

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.990
person makes the decisions
in another domain.

01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.910
There's differences between
species and the extent to

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:55.380
which this happens.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:58.670
In general, if there is a large
difference in dominance,

01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:01.230
so if you're really of a
higher status than your

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:04.240
partner is, you tend
to make most

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.390
decisions across contests.

01:02:06.390 --> 01:02:07.950
But it's sensitive to the
environment, to the

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:09.160
characteristic of the
other individual.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.310
It's not a unitary concept.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.376
It can be complex to explain.

01:02:13.376 --> 01:02:15.110
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can we just
take two more questions?

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.100
Is that OK?

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.980
Because there's one
over there.

01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:21.400
AUDIENCE: My question is, one
thing you started out with in

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.760
your lecture, or in your story
here, is basically that pretty

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:28.390
much everything humans do has a
at least rudimentary version

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:30.370
in the animal kingdom,
correct?

01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.120
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: In some
primate species, yes.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:33.710
Not everything.

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.280
Not everything.

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.710
AUDIENCE: But then you go on
and you say, oh, but humans

01:02:37.710 --> 01:02:38.890
are special.

01:02:38.890 --> 01:02:39.860
And I don't get that.

01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.690
Why are you suddenly-- are you
saying humans have a soul,

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:43.870
something that is not--

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.550
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: OK,
so humans are special.

01:02:46.550 --> 01:02:49.240
And every animal species
is special.

01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.590
Your domestic cat is special.

01:02:50.590 --> 01:02:51.280
They're not like dogs.

01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.490
Dogs are special.

01:02:52.490 --> 01:02:54.330
Chimpanzees are special.

01:02:54.330 --> 01:02:56.510
Every species is special
in its own way.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:59.880
Humans are special when compared
to other primates,

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.130
especially because we have
a very large brain.

01:03:02.130 --> 01:03:05.000
So our large brain essentially
allows us to do things with

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:07.500
our minds that other animals
don't do, which is, for

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:10.380
example, produce abstract
thought.

01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:12.710
We are unique in the animal
world in our ability to think

01:03:12.710 --> 01:03:16.240
about things that don't exist in
reality, that exist only at

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.580
an abstract level.

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:20.310
Also, we're unique in our
ability to think about

01:03:20.310 --> 01:03:23.170
religion, to think about God,
to think about spirituality,

01:03:23.170 --> 01:03:26.810
to think about the future and
plan years in advance of

01:03:26.810 --> 01:03:31.690
things that might happen, to
produce art, for example.

01:03:31.690 --> 01:03:34.620
So there's all these ways-- and
to produce cultures and

01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:37.110
laws and moralities, and
things like that.

01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:39.700
I didn't say much about this
stuff because that's not what

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.520
my book is about.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.660
My book is about social
relationships.

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:46.180
So the idea here is that despite
of these large brains,

01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:49.580
and despite of this potential
that we have to think in

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:53.140
abstract ways-- to be moral, to
be artistic, intellectual--

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:55.260
when it comes to the day-to-day
problems of social

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:58.460
relationships, we end up using
solutions that have been

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.840
around a long time, that come
to us almost instinctively,

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:05.010
that our mind unconsciously
processes.

01:04:05.010 --> 01:04:07.470
And so these solutions
are what we share

01:04:07.470 --> 01:04:08.570
with these other animals.

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:12.230
So if I had written a book about
morality or God or art,

01:04:12.230 --> 01:04:16.790
obviously I would have less of
a reason about primates.

01:04:16.790 --> 01:04:19.190
But I do talk in one of
my chapters about--

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:21.420
because actually, somebody
yesterday asked me this

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:25.480
question, what about virtuous
people like artists or

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.010
religious leaders.

01:04:27.010 --> 01:04:29.080
Can you compare those
to primates?

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:31.060
They've accomplished so much.

01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:33.240
And the thing is that there's
always an interesting

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.760
disconnect between what these
people have accomplished in

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:40.150
their intellectual life, in
their public life, and what

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:41.390
they do in their
personal lives.

01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:44.610
Sometimes talk about Pablo
Picasso and the issues he had

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:45.800
in his private life.

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:47.583
Sometimes you read about the
personal lives of these people

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:50.110
who were very virtuous in
public, but they have a

01:04:50.110 --> 01:04:52.360
history of marriage and divorce,
of extramarital

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.070
affairs, of greed for money,
and things like that.

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:57.540
So when it comes to your
relationships and social

01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:00.640
lives, I think people are much
much more similar to each

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:03.310
other than they are different
because we share this

01:05:03.310 --> 01:05:04.560
background.

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:11.580
AUDIENCE: So when you gave a
comparison of communication

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:16.495
with another person over email
or in life, then one thing

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:19.830
came to my mind that with
internet and with email and

01:05:19.830 --> 01:05:22.750
instant messaging, you can
actually allow yourself to

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.610
have conversations with several
different people.

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:29.250
And these conversations will be
unrelated from each other.

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:34.920
So does it somehow change
something in the patterns, or

01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:37.060
are there new patterns
appearing?

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.490
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: I'm
sure there are, yes.

01:05:38.490 --> 01:05:42.640
I'm sure there's all kinds of
new things that originate with

01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.370
the ability to interact
simultaneously

01:05:45.370 --> 01:05:47.740
with multiple people.

01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:50.630
But as there are benefits,
there's probably also costs.

01:05:50.630 --> 01:05:53.940
So there's something that you
lose if you don't have that

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:55.780
direct, face-to-face
interactions.

01:05:55.780 --> 01:06:00.200
When we speak in person, we use
facial expressions, we use

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:04.130
hand gestures to tell the other
person, look, what I'm

01:06:04.130 --> 01:06:05.160
saying right now,
I mean it very

01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:07.410
seriously or just for fun.

01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:10.950
You can say, sometimes you
make me want to kill you.

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:12.680
But if I say it with
a smile on my face,

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.800
you know I'm joking.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.600
If I say it on email,
you don't know what

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:16.070
to interpret that.

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:17.990
You have to use a little
emoticon with a little smiley

01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:19.840
face to say I'm joking.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.520
But do emoticons really
do it all?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:28.590
Do they really replace all the
facial expressions, all the

01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:31.270
other gestures that we use to
supplement the information

01:06:31.270 --> 01:06:33.000
that we provide with
our words?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.610
In my view, they don't.

01:06:34.610 --> 01:06:37.170
And also, there's all kinds of
other dynamics that come into

01:06:37.170 --> 01:06:40.990
play, including relative status,
costs and benefits,

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:42.610
what your expect from
the relationship.

01:06:42.610 --> 01:06:46.200
That all plays a role in our
communication dynamics, no

01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:48.370
matter how high tech they are.

01:06:51.310 --> 01:06:53.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm afraid that
we've run out of time.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.300
But I just want to say thanks
again for coming in and

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.110
talking to us today.

01:06:56.110 --> 01:06:56.670
DARIO MAESTRIPIERI: Thanks
for having me.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:57.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's been a
really interesting talk.

01:06:57.850 --> 01:07:00.020
And if you could just give him
another round of applause to

01:07:00.020 --> 01:07:01.270
say thank you.
