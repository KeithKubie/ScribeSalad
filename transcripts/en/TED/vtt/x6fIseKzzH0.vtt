00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.306
The basic problem
with working in an office

00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:04.946
is you're just not in control
of your work environment.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.170
[The Way We Work]

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.746
Howdy, my name is Matt,
and I'm the CEO of Automattic,

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.626
the company behind WordPress.com,
Jetpack and WooCommerce.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.866
We're coming up on over 800 employees,
and they live everywhere,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.666
from California to Alabama, Mississippi,
to where I live in Texas.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.546
They're also in 67 countries.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.863
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand.

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:29.943
Some of them choose not even
to have a home base, they're nomads.

00:00:29.968 --> 00:00:32.301
Whether they are in RVs
or traveling through Airbnbs,

00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.701
they are in new places
every day, week or month.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.821
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi,
we don't care where they are.

00:00:37.845 --> 00:00:40.781
Our focus on distributed work
didn't happen accidentally.

00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:43.381
It was a conscious choice
from the very beginning.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:45.701
Notice I don't use the word "remote,"

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:47.421
because it sets up the expectation,

00:00:47.445 --> 00:00:49.581
that some people are essential
and some aren't.

00:00:49.605 --> 00:00:52.061
I use the word "distributed"
to describe what we do,

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:53.452
where everyone is
on an equal playing field.

00:00:53.582 --> 00:00:55.066
I think a distributed workforce

00:00:55.091 --> 00:00:56.704
is the most effective way
to build a company.

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:58.973
The key is you have to
approach it consciously.

00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:00.290
When we started WordPress,

00:01:00.448 --> 00:01:03.424
many of the first 20 hires
were people I'd never met in person.

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:06.033
But we'd collaborated online,
sometimes for years.

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:09.599
I wanted to continue that
for one simple reason.

00:01:09.624 --> 00:01:11.561
I believe that talent and intelligence

00:01:11.586 --> 00:01:13.334
are equally distributed
throughout the world.

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:14.633
But opportunity is not.

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.355
In Silicon Valley,
the big tech companies fish

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:19.635
from essentially
the same small pond or bay.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.595
A distributed company
can fish from the entire ocean.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.115
Instead of hiring someone who grew up
in Japan but lives in California,

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:27.995
you can gain someone who lives, works,

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:31.035
wakes up and goes to sleep
wherever they are in the world.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.555
They bring a different
understanding of that culture

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.235
and a different lived experience.

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.555
At the base of the decision
to go distributed,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.195
there's a desire to give people autonomy
over how they do their work.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.035
Unless you're in a role
where specific hours are important,

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:45.555
you can make your own schedule.

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.195
Everyone can have a corner office,
their windows, the food they want to eat,

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:52.035
you can choose when there's music
and when there's silence.

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:54.475
You can choose what temperature
the room should be.

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:56.555
You can save the time
you'd spend commuting

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.915
and put it into things
that are important to you.

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.675
A distributed workforce
is ideal for a technology company.

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:03.035
But people often ask me,

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:06.315
"This works great for y'all,
but what about everyone else?"

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.541
If you have an office,

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:10.274
you can do a few things
to build distributed capability.

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:12.865
First: document everything.

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:15.679
In an office, it's easy
to make decisions in the moment,

00:02:15.703 --> 00:02:17.075
in the kitchen, in the hall.

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:18.435
But if people work remotely

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.275
and some members of the team
are having those conversations

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:22.555
they don't have access to,

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.834
they'll see these decisions being made
without understanding the why.

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:29.275
Always leave a trail of where you were
and what you were thinking about.

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:31.635
This allows others to pick up
where you left off.

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.155
It allows people in different
time zones to interact,

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.915
it's also great to think about
as an organization evolves,

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:38.563
people leaving and people joining.

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:41.814
Try to have as much communication
as possible online.

00:02:41.873 --> 00:02:46.315
When everything's shared and public,
it allows new people to catch up quickly.

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:48.355
You also need to find the right tools.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:51.995
There are so many apps and services
that help with day-to-day communication,

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:54.355
video conferencing, project management.

00:02:54.486 --> 00:02:58.237
The things that changed how you work
probably aren't objects anymore.

00:02:58.381 --> 00:03:00.623
They're things you access
through your computer.

00:03:00.648 --> 00:03:03.715
So experiment with different
tools that enable collaboration,

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.995
see what works.

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.995
Create productive, face-to-face time.

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.275
In a traditional office,

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.635
you're in the same place
48 weeks out of the year

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:12.795
and you might have
three or four weeks apart.

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.075
We try to flip that: we come together
for short, intense bursts.

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:17.715
Once a year we do a grand meet-up

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.155
where the entire company
comes together for a week.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.675
It's half-work, half-play.

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:23.555
The primary goal is connecting people.

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.475
We want to make sure
everyone's aligned and on the same page,

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:29.155
and they have a deeper connection
with their colleagues.

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:31.315
When they work together
the rest of the year,

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.955
they can bring together
that understanding and empathy.

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.235
And the final practice:

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:38.217
give people the flexibility
to make their own work environment.

00:03:38.242 --> 00:03:40.635
Every person at Automattic
has a co-working stipend

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:42.755
that they can put
towards a co-working space

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:46.155
or just to buy coffee, so they don't
get kicked out of the coffee shop.

00:03:46.179 --> 00:03:49.075
One group in Seattle
decided to pool their stipends together

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:50.915
and rented a workspace on a fishing pier.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.835
Each person who joins the company
gets a home-office stipend.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:57.115
This is money they can invest
in getting the right chair, monitor,

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.950
the right desk setup, so they can have
the most productive environment for them.

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:04.795
Today, there are just a few companies
that are distributed first.

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.755
In a decade or two,
I predict that 90 percent of companies

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:10.275
that are going to be changing
the course of the world

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:11.795
are going to function this way.

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:15.755
They will evolve to be distributed first,
or they'll be replaced by those that are.

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.195
As you think about
what you're going to build next,

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:20.315
consider how you can tap
into global talent,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:23.435
give people autonomy to live and work
where they feel they should

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:27.075
and still participate fully in whatever
it is that you're creating together.
