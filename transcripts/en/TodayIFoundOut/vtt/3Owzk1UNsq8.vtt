00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.610
Bumping into a rock or a reef, war, swamped
by rough weather or high waves, pilot error

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.860
or pirates, there are a variety of ways a
ship can sink.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.230
After it does, depending on whether it floated
out on its own, was thrown overboard or sank

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.230
to Davy Jones Locker, the equipment, cargo
and bits of ship that leave a wreck have distinct

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.550
names, with the distinction classically being
important in maritime law.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.740
Flotsam denotes that wreckage from a ship
that is later found floating on the sea’s

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.740
surface.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.579
The word traces its roots to the early 1600s
and the Anglo-French floteson, which derived

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.070
from the Old French flotaison (meaning “a
floating.”)

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.200
The word in English was spelled flotsen until
the mid-1800s, when it took on its modern

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.200
variant.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.930
Jetsam, first seen in the mid-1500s, is the
stuff that was purposely thrown off a ship

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.840
by its crew to lighten its load (usually during
troubling times), and is washed ashore.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.210
The word is a modification and contraction
of the Middle English jetteson, itself from

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.539
the Anglo-French getteson and Old French getaison
(meaning “a throwing.”)

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:20.399
As for the often more figurative expression
“flotsam and jetsam,” this appears to

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.760
have popped up around the early to mid-19th
century, with one of the earliest known documented

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.090
instances, according to the OED, appearing
in the June 1, 1861 edition of All Y.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:38.090
Round: “Turkey buzzards were searching for
flotson and jetson in the shape of dead Irish

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.369
deck hands.”

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.319
As for other similar shipwreck terms, any
wreckage from a ship that sinks is lagan (ligan),

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.380
a word that apparently derives from an Old
English (500-1150 AD) word that meant, among

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.790
other things, to lie down and be at rest.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.240
Wreckage that sinks to the ocean floor and
has no hope of recovery is called derelict;

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.099
this word traces its origins in English to
the 1640s and is derived from the Latin derelictus

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:03.100
for solitary and deserted.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.789
Its meaning of an abandoned vessel may be
traced back to the 1660s.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.000
Researchers with the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimate

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.420
that as many as one million shipwrecks remain
underwater in the world’s oceans, and a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.850
majority of these remain undiscovered.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.180
For instance, during the 300-year Spanish
plunder of the Americas, it is estimated that

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.290
10% of what was shipped off was lost; these
wrecks are today collectively worth several

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.620
billion dollars.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.530
At least one treasure hunter estimates that
there remains approximately $60 billion worth

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.239
of lagan resting on the floors of the world’s
oceans.

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:48.840
One recovered wreck in 2012, the H.M.S. Victory
that sank in the English Channel in 1744,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.659
contained four tons of gold coins worth, if
auctioned for their historical value, up to

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.760
$1 billion, although the gold itself was only
worth about $160 million.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.819
A risky business, treasure salvagers sometimes
have their finds taken away.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:11.340
For example, in 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court
affirmed the 2009 decision of a lower federal

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.999
court that the treasure hunters’ claim to
$600 million in found gold and silver was

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:20.650
insufficient to defeat other claims by the
Spanish government.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.280
Adding insult to injury, the treasure hunters
(Odyssey Marine Exploration) were also eventually

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.889
ordered to pay a portion of Spain’s legal
fees in prosecuting the suit.

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:34.969
Learning from the experience, before beginning
a subsequent salvage operation of the Victory

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:40.879
in 2012, Odyssey negotiated an agreement whereby
they would document the site prior to salvage,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.290
and then recover items of historical significance
that would be given to the claimant, Maritime

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.430
Heritage Foundation (which received the title
for wreck from British authorities).

00:03:50.430 --> 00:04:29.090
In exchange, the foundation will pay Odyssey
for the items recovered.
