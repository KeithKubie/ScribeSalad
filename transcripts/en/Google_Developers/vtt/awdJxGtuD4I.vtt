MANDY WAITE: Welcome to Google
Developers Live Presents Women

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.610
Tech Makers, today from
Campus London.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.750
My name's Mandy Waite.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.880
I'm a developer advocate for
the Google Cloud platform.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.780
EZE VIDRA: And I'm Eze Vidra.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.140
And I'm the head of
Campus London.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.620
We have Sue here today,
Dr. Black.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.610
SUE BLACK: Hello, hi.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.050
MANDY WAITE: Yes.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.070
So quick introduction of Sue.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.800
Dr. Sue Black is an
award-winning computer

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.820
scientist, an inspiration--

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.560
an inspiring and passionate
leader--

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.010
we should have rehearsed
this--

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.960
who excels at bringing
people together to

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.310
solve complex issues.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.640
She's a senior research
associate at the Department of

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.220
Computer Science at the
University College London, UK.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.110
She has been instrumental in
championing awareness of and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.980
support for Bletchley
Park, and has

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.200
recently become a trustee.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.380
Keen to champion women in
computing, Sue set up the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.990
BCSWomen online network in 2001,
and has recently become

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.680
a strategic adviser for ACM-W.
Sue also sits on the UK

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.690
Foreign Secretaries Group on
freedom of expression.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.960
Passionate about computer
science and its benefits to

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.570
individuals, organizations,
and the economy, Sue has

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.260
recently set up a nonprofit
organization called The 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.850
Foundation to promote computing
to the public.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.800
Sue is a frequent public
speaker, media savvy, and

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.770
social-media-holic.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.820
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.120
EZE VIDRA: Aren't we all?

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.410
So welcome, Sue.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.730
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:57.365
Thanks very much.

00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:59.090
EZE VIDRA: It's great to
have you here today.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.500
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.950
EZE VIDRA: OK.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.430
So we're going to start off
with some straightforward

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.510
questions about your background

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.170
and history in computing.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.415
It would be really interesting
to find out what kind of

00:02:07.415 --> 00:02:09.750
inspired you to go into computer
science and into

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.070
computing in general.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.380
So I understand from reading
various articles and such like

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.220
you have a PhD in software
engineering.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.190
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.320
MANDY WAITE: You also started in
the CS path at [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.360
College.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.812
But you did computer science
at South Bank University.

00:02:24.812 --> 00:02:25.680
SUE BLACK: That's right.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.110
MANDY WAITE: So what did you
first decide to actually

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.120
pursue an education in tech?

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.123
And what motivated you to
study computer science

00:02:31.123 --> 00:02:32.090
specifically?

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.720
SUE BLACK: Well, I suppose to
start with, I guess-- someone

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.330
was asking me a while ago how
it was I first knew I was a

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.190
geek, so maybe that's kind of
a better place to start.

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.520
And thinking back, the first
time that I could think of was

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.460
when I was about seven or eight,
I used to save up all

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.685
my pocket money and buy math
textbooks with my pocket money

00:02:50.685 --> 00:02:52.480
at the weekends.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.920
So I guess that was one of the
first signs that I was

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.240
interested in this area.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.040
Maths was always my best
subject at school.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.745
And there wasn't really
computing at school, because

00:03:00.745 --> 00:03:01.220
I'm really old.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.710
There wasn't really computing
at school when I was there.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.920
So I couldn't take
it at school.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.980
When I was thinking about going
to university, I thought

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:11.900
of maths again.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.390
So I studied maths
at [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.435
College.

00:03:13.435 --> 00:03:16.700
And as part of that course,
we did a bit of

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.700
computing as well.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.980
And I really liked
the programming.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.280
I found it really interesting.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.170
And in a much broader sense, I
suppose, I really have always

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.640
felt that technology and
computing is kind of the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.790
subject of the future.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.890
It's really exciting.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.120
And it kind of enables you to
do so many things in so many

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.980
different areas.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.680
So it doesn't really kind
of pin you down.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.950
It kind of broadens out your
opportunities, I suppose.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.520
So when I was choosing
a degree, I

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.220
could have chosen maths.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.560
I was choosing between
maths and computing.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.320
And I thought firstly that
computing is the future, which

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.010
I still believe.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.390
And also I thought
it would help--

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.240
I'd be more likely to get a job
if I did computing than if

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.840
I did maths, which probably
isn't true, because I think,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.050
you know, it's probably just
as easy to get a job with a

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.350
maths degree.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.180
But I mean, that's kind
of how I got into it.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.600
And then once I was studying
computing at university, I

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.420
really liked the research
aspect in my final year.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:16.870
And that's kind of what led
me into doing a PhD.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.010
And software engineering I think
is kind of the practical

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.915
side of computer science.

00:04:21.915 --> 00:04:25.140
And I'm a very practical person,
so I think that's how

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.780
I ended up doing software
engineering.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.170
MANDY WAITE: Excellent.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.310
So was there ever any chance
you would do philosophy or

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.350
art, anything like that?

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.860
Was that--

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.000
SUE BLACK: Well, I didn't
actually think about it.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.740
Yes.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.310
Before I did the maths
course at [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.220
College, I did kind of think
around that whole area.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.050
And actually, I did a return
to study course a long time

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.265
before that.

00:04:43.265 --> 00:04:45.070
And we studied various different
subjects, and that

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:49.950
included like philosophy,
economics, English literature.

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.780
And I really did like the
politics and economics stuff

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:56.266
that we did.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:59.150
So I could have gone that way,
but technology is the future,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.060
so I didn't.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.040
MANDY WAITE: So you're
a self-described

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.656
social media junkie.

00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:06.522
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:05:06.522 --> 00:05:08.330
MANDY WAITE: It's kind of like
aren't we all nowadays.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:09.430
It seems to be a big
part of life.

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.420
SUE BLACK: My name's Sue and
I'm a social-media-holic.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.360
EZE VIDRA: This is rehab.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.150
SUE BLACK: Good.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.600
Good.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.630
I'm glad I finally found it.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:19.476
MANDY WAITE: So I've asked
this question of

00:05:19.476 --> 00:05:21.500
a few people today.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.150
How has social media
changed your life?

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.382
And has it improved your
life, do you think?

00:05:25.382 --> 00:05:25.780
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:26.530
Absolutely.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.850
It really has changed my life.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.410
I mean, in terms of finding
people that you can connect

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:38.660
with quite easily, Twitter was
kind of my intro, I suppose,

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.080
into the whole social
media thing.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:47.200
And from being on Twitter for
not very long at all, I ended

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.790
up finding people or they found
me who are interested in

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:50.760
the same kind of things.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.150
And that's kind of how the
Bletchley Park and social

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:57.600
media campaigning aspect
came about.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:01.610
And now, you know, I mean with
Facebook and Google+, there's

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:08.130
so many social media conduits or
kind of channels that it's

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:13.440
wonderful in that you can really
find people that you

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:14.280
get on well with.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.790
I quite often give the example,
as a computer science

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.860
academic, I go to conferences.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.710
And so kind of around the world,
I know people in my

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.550
area that I want to go
down the pub with

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.860
and have a chat with.

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:30.200
So that's kind of a subset of
all the people that I meet in

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.880
the sort of computer
science academic

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.130
software engineering role.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.760
What social media enables you to
do is to find those kind of

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.670
people, so the people I would
get along with, but they're

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.450
not in the same kind of
career path as me.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.660
They might be in marketing or
any kind of career, basically,

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:54.330
because somehow, through social
media interaction--

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.230
I suppose mainly because
of search, really.

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.750
Because of search, you can find
people and people can

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.960
find you that have
shared interests.

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.280
And for me, sense of humor
is really important.

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.430
And so finding people with the
same sense of humor, you can

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:07.750
do that through social media.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:09.060
So that's wonderful.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.280
And personally, I've probably
got 50 to 100 friends that I

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.204
get on really well with who I
never would have met if it

00:07:17.204 --> 00:07:19.320
weren't for social media.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.420
So that's kind of
the plus side.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:23.550
And also, of course, the
campaigning and kind of social

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:26.430
change, social media has
empowered loads of

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.810
people in that way.

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.130
So it's helped with
Bletchley Park.

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:33.330
But it's also helped with other
campaigns and the whole

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.750
Arab Spring, just that way of
connecting which just wasn't

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.240
there before.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.220
EZE VIDRA: Can you give us an
example where social media

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:45.500
changed how you accomplish
things in your work or run a

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.830
campaign using social media
that was successful?

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.240
SUE BLACK: So you mean like
Bletchley Park as an example?

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.840
EZE VIDRA: Yes, for example.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.010
SUE BLACK: Well, we've done
various things over the years

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:57.290
using social media.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:04.480
And one example is because what
you can do is you can

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.000
find people that are interested
in the same things

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.640
as you, so obviously, Bletchley
Park specifically,

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.570
you can search for Bletchley
Park and see who's talking

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.230
about it using social media.

00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:16.360
But also then if you've got
something about Bletchley Park

00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:18.420
on your profile, other people
searching for Bletchley Park

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.140
can find you.

00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:20.950
And so if you start
conversations with these

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:25.370
people, over time that builds up
into a community of people

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:27.280
that are not just interacting
with you, but interacting with

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.650
each other, which I think
is wonderful.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.150
And so one example of where that
made a kind of concrete

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:37.690
difference was that with Kelsey
Griffin at Bletchley

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:40.760
Park and Professor Jonathan
Bowen at South Bank

00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.860
University, we wrote a paper
about Bletchley Park which we

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:47.930
submitted to the museums in a
web conference in Denver a

00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:49.250
couple of years ago.

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.900
And so we wrote the paper
and submitted it.

00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.820
And the paper was accepted.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.500
And then I realized that we
didn't have the funding to go

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.660
to the conference.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.070
And I thought, oh, I've put
Bletchley Park in a situation

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:06.100
now where I'm trying to get
people to raise funds for

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:07.960
Bletchley Park but they're
now going to have to

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.590
pay for this to happen.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:11.720
So I was kind of in a bit of
a quandary about what to do

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.720
about that.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:18.110
And some great friends on
Twitter, this time, Paul

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.460
Clarke and Daren140--

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.980
gosh, I know people's Twitter
IDs, but I can't remember

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:25.710
their real names.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.860
They're people I know
really well.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.110
Sorry, Daren--

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.950
encouraged me to set up a
JustGiving account to help

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.743
fund our trips, so me and Kelsey
could go over to the

00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:37.330
States to present this paper.

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:39.220
And so I kind of ummed and ahhed
about it for a while.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.720
And then I thought,
I'll give it a go.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.540
So I set up a JustGiving page.

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.790
And within two weeks, we raised
enough money, it's over

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:50.250
2,000 pounds, just from friends,
community people that

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:53.940
love Bletchley Park, through
Twitter for us to go to the

00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.440
conference.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:59.830
That's just one thing, but a
very specific thing that it

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:01.000
really did help with.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.440
EZE VIDRA: Yes.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.030
Very effective.

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:06.300
MANDY WAITE: So on the subject
of Bletchley Park, that's a

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.100
good lead into my
next question.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.845
Bletchley Park was the home to
British code breakers during

00:10:10.845 --> 00:10:11.300
the Second World War.

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.820
And thanks to their efforts and
the work that they did,

00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.700
it's been said frequently that
it reduced the length of the

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.300
war by about two years, saved
millions of lives.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:19.880
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.060
11 million people a
year were dying.

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:21.230
MANDY WAITE: Yes.

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:21.840
Exactly.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:25.170
So it's an amazing effort that
deserves a lot of recognition.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.350
And Bletchley Park is a big part
of that, so it has huge

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.440
historical significance.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.560
And thanks to all the
campaigning that you've done

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:35.190
with other people as well and
your continued support, it's

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.460
been preserved for our
national heritage.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:39.345
You're a Bletchley
Park trustee now.

00:10:39.345 --> 00:10:39.670
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:43.250
MANDY WAITE: And you've talked
a lot on many occasions about

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:48.030
how the campaign initiated and
what it's done so far.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:49.970
But what's next for
Bletchley Park?

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:52.840
What do we need to do
to continue the

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.620
momentum we have so far.

00:10:54.620 --> 00:10:58.900
SUE BLACK: Well, the future is
very exciting for Bletchley.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.450
We got I think 4.6 million from
Heritage Lottery last

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.630
year, which we've got match
funding for as well, so it's

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.650
about 6 million or 7 million
now being spent on

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:10.830
renovating the site.

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:14.570
And the idea is to kind of take
it back sympathetically

00:11:14.570 --> 00:11:18.350
to like a 1940s feel, which
I think will be really

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:20.420
wonderful, because you know, if
you've been there, if you

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.010
just imagine going in and it
actually does seem like it's

00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.520
1940, to me that-- oh,
I just can't wait

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.230
until it's like that.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.790
So that money's for specific
renovations.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:33.870
But there's a 26-acre
site there.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.320
There are lots of other
buildings, huts, blocks, which

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:37.520
needs attention.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.040
And basically, Bletchley Park
is doing well, but they need

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:42.810
more money.

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.950
Give us your money.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:47.690
So please--

00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:50.850
I really want everyone to go up
there and see it, because I

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.870
think once you go up there,
you get a feel for what

00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:57.240
happened there, for how
important it is, for what the

00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.880
site is like.

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.340
It's an amazing place.

00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:01.120
And so go and visit.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:03.760
And get your friends to visit.

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:08.000
And also, anybody in technology
companies, it would

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.580
be great to have more
sponsorship and funding from

00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:14.490
technology companies, so if
anyone can help with that,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:15.350
that would be great.

00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:16.740
So it's a very bright future.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.160
But we need more money.

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.570
EZE VIDRA: So the
year is 2018.

00:12:19.570 --> 00:12:20.740
You've acquired the money.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.140
What's the vision?

00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:23.800
What would you like
to accomplish if

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.020
everything is renovated?

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:28.990
SUE BLACK: Well, it's going to
be an international museum,

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:33.790
basically, which with 26 acres,
it's a massive site.

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:38.500
So it'll be a state of the art
museum, but also it'll be like

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.605
walking into the 1940s.

00:12:39.605 --> 00:12:43.310
So it will be interesting to
actually see how that kind of

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:45.180
all comes together.

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.690
And I think there will be like
a state of the art conference

00:12:49.690 --> 00:12:50.790
center there.

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:54.780
There will be educational
facilities, because the great

00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.710
thing about Bletchley Park is
that it brings together kind

00:12:57.710 --> 00:12:59.705
of the humanities and
the sciences.

00:12:59.705 --> 00:13:03.220
You know, we've got Colossus,
the world's first programmable

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:06.240
digital computer, there,
used as part of the

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.710
code-breaking effort.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.850
We've also got the amazing
history from the Second World

00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:14.010
War, and the fact that it
shortened the war and saved so

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.080
many lives.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.740
We've also got the whole thing
about the women that worked

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.960
there, because most people
think that--

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.850
well, my idea when I first went
there was it was probably

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:26.290
50 middle-aged blokes in tweed
jackets sitting around smoking

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.890
pipes doing the Times
crossword.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:30.890
That's kind of my image of what
was at Bletchley Park.

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.860
But in fact, it was more
than 10,000 people.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:35.660
And more than half of
them were women.

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.550
And I was there last week
or the week before.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:43.220
The Duchess of Cornwall came
up to see and talk to 60 of

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:44.760
the women that worked there.

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.600
And they were I think from 16
upwards, but mainly kind of

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.750
late teens, early 20s.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.710
They went there from school
and university to work.

00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:58.780
There were more than 5,000
girls, basically, you know,

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.190
like young women, working
there who did all

00:14:01.190 --> 00:14:02.110
this amazing stuff.

00:14:02.110 --> 00:14:05.020
And we don't really know hardly
anything about their

00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:06.490
contributions.

00:14:06.490 --> 00:14:10.810
So there will be something
telling their story as well.

00:14:10.810 --> 00:14:11.520
Absolutely.

00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.390
MANDY WAITE: That's great.

00:14:14.390 --> 00:14:16.540
One of my favorite features of
Bletchley Park, which I had

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:19.590
the fortune to see in November,
a VIP tour of

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.450
Bletchley Park which
was amazing.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.530
I actually say the Alan
Turing Papers.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.830
Alan Turing is the father
of modern computing.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.485
Both you and Eve agree
with that.

00:14:27.485 --> 00:14:27.740
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.366
MANDY WAITE: Some people say
it's von Neumann, but--

00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:32.100
[INAUDIBLE].

00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:33.910
He's a real hero to me.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.430
But until yourself and Simon
Meacham actually drew it to my

00:14:37.430 --> 00:14:41.305
attention, I had no idea about
Alan Turing's papers and the

00:14:41.305 --> 00:14:43.430
fact that they were going to go
off to [INAUDIBLE] country.

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:45.850
And then you did all of this
work to raise the funding to

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:49.490
actually keep the papers
in Bletchley Park.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.650
So as a consequence, they're
there now in this wonderful

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.680
Alan Turing exhibit at
Bletchley, which I recommend

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:55.440
that everybody see
if they go there.

00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.940
SUE BLACK: Well, that was
actually a massive combined

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.265
effort, because it was a guy
called Gareth Halfacree that

00:14:59.265 --> 00:15:03.740
set up a JustGiving asking for
people to give money to help

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:04.870
Bletchley buy the papers.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:09.630
And then I luckily met Megan
Smith at a conference, a

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:13.470
Google VP who was speaking,
and she said she'd help.

00:15:13.470 --> 00:15:15.860
And then Simon Meacham got
in contact with me.

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.910
And Google gave $100,000
towards

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:20.060
it, which was wonderful.

00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:22.490
But then that actually
didn't make the

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.530
price that was needed.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.980
And so Bletchley Park, Simon
Green at Bletchley Park found

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.610
other funders basically
to come in.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:31.230
And so again, it's kind of like
there's lots of things

00:15:31.230 --> 00:15:33.660
around Bletchley Park, but most
of it is all kind of--

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:35.630
it's a team effort of lots
and lots of people

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:36.670
doing bits and pieces.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:38.930
And that's one of the things I
really love about it, is that

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.300
because people feel so strongly
about Bletchley lots

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.490
of people, very different
people, work together to make

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:47.290
the good things happen.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.860
MANDY WAITE: So I wanted to
continue on a theme of Alan

00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:51.730
Turing and just briefly, what
do Alan Turing's papers

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:52.670
represent to you?

00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:55.575
Why are they so important to
everybody in this country?

00:15:55.575 --> 00:15:57.270
SUE BLACK: Well, because they're
kind of like some of

00:15:57.270 --> 00:16:01.390
the fundamental papers in
computing and the first ideas

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.460
of computing.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.220
He's been called the father of
computer science, and I think

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:08.490
for very good reasons with
the Turing machine

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.270
and the Turing test.

00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:13.705
So what's interesting for me
was finding out-- because a

00:16:13.705 --> 00:16:14.880
lot of this stuff
I didn't know.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.442
I wasn't taught on my
computing degree.

00:16:19.442 --> 00:16:19.820
Yeah.

00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.150
I can't believe I don't think
I was taught anything at all

00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:22.835
about Alan Turing.

00:16:22.835 --> 00:16:25.540
And so probably lots of
other people weren't

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:28.940
But it's been great over the
last few years how lots of

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.200
people now know his name.

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:33.360
And with the centenary last
year, some fabulous work done

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.650
by Barry Cooper who ran that--

00:16:36.650 --> 00:16:36.890
yeah.

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:40.540
It's just great that it's all
kind of out there now.

00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:43.990
And actually, there's a great
AudioBoo that I did with

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.800
Julian Wilson who works at
Christie's, who looked after--

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.800
who handled the papers, who in
five minutes tells you exactly

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.410
why Turing's papers
are so important.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:54.940
MANDY WAITE: Oh, excellent.

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:56.425
SUE BLACK: So that's on
my AudioBoo stream.

00:16:56.425 --> 00:16:57.450
EZE VIDRA: Check it out.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:16:59.910
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:01.290
MANDY WAITE: It's been said of
you that you're an inspiration

00:17:01.290 --> 00:17:03.146
to ladies either working
in or thinking

00:17:03.146 --> 00:17:04.880
of working in computing.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.790
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:05.790 --> 00:17:08.579
get exactly to the heart of
Women Techmakers, what Women

00:17:08.579 --> 00:17:11.710
Techmakers is all about, to
provide inspirational role

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:14.635
models for people of all ages
who are considering education

00:17:14.635 --> 00:17:16.430
or careers in technology.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:20.810
So my question to you as a
role model, does it take

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:22.196
something special to
be a role model?

00:17:22.196 --> 00:17:24.060
Can anyone be a role model?

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:24.800
SUE BLACK: Yeah.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.260
No, I don't think it takes
anything special.

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:27.964
I don't think I'm anything
special.

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:30.660
I'm just someone who's
passionate and works hard, is

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.530
how I see it really.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.650
And I'm very happy if people
can see me as a role model,

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:38.100
because I think we do need
more women role models in

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:39.230
tech, definitely.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:42.100
There are some amazing people,
like Steve Shirley.

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:44.670
I don't know if you know
Dame Stephanie

00:17:44.670 --> 00:17:46.870
Shirley as she is now.

00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:50.010
She's just written a fantastic
autobiography, which I'm

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:51.260
partway through, so I recommend

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.440
everyone please read that.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:56.900
And Wendy Hall is a great
role model, sort of in

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.510
the academic sphere.

00:17:58.510 --> 00:18:03.490
There are so many great women
around, but we do need, and it

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:07.080
seems women particularly need
role models to kind of help

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.680
them think that they
can do it too.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:11.760
So if I can go any way
towards doing that,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.460
then I'm very happy.

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.600
EZE VIDRA: On the topic of role
models, who are your role

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.040
models or have they changed
throughout the years when you

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.700
started off in computer
science and now?

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.170
SUE BLACK: Well, I mean, I
think at the beginning I

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:25.920
probably didn't really
know any, really.

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:27.840
I mean, I don't think
I really knew--

00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.070
I don't think I knew
about Ada Lovelace.

00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:33.220
I don't think I knew about
Steve Shirley.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.510
I can't really think of any
women in tech that I

00:18:36.510 --> 00:18:39.990
knew at that time.

00:18:39.990 --> 00:18:42.790
So now, Steve Shirley is
definitely a great

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:43.850
role model for me.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:46.660
I mean, what she's done is
amazing, going from being a

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:50.550
refugee in the Second World War
through to setting up her

00:18:50.550 --> 00:18:56.875
own company working only, I
think at least to start with,

00:18:56.875 --> 00:19:00.020
with women, programming at
home and women with kids

00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.810
programming at home, and
building that into a massive

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.320
software empire.

00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:08.560
I think she sold it for I
can't remember how many

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.320
million sometime ago.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.880
And it really gets me kind of
that we still haven't got to

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.460
that level now where that's
a normal thing to do.

00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:21.320
But I think she kind of ran the
company solely with women

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.490
working at home to start with.

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:25.520
So yes, she's great
role model.

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.600
Wendy Hall is a great
role model too.

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.270
She's sort of been banging the
drum for a long time, since

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:32.120
before I was involved.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:34.740
And she's been very
supportive to me.

00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:36.650
So she's great.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:39.794
There are so many now, but we
still need more, right?

00:19:39.794 --> 00:19:40.650
MANDY WAITE: Yes.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.190
Please stay tuned for a future
Women Techmakers.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.802
We'll be having Wendy
Hall in this chair.

00:19:45.802 --> 00:19:46.726
SUE BLACK: Yay.

00:19:46.726 --> 00:19:47.650
MANDY WAITE: Which
is fantastic.

00:19:47.650 --> 00:19:48.470
SUE BLACK: She's great fun.

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.600
MANDY WAITE: So talking about
women in computing, women in

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.952
technology, what Women
Techmakers is all about, so

00:19:53.952 --> 00:19:57.330
this is kind of an opinionated
question,

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:58.730
but statistics suggest--

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:02.350
and I've read a lot of
statistics, statistics of

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:04.980
statistics as well, that the
pipeline from education to the

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.540
workplace is more of a funnel
that narrows very rapidly when

00:20:08.540 --> 00:20:10.340
it comes to women progressing
towards a career in

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:11.910
technology.

00:20:11.910 --> 00:20:14.770
It also seems to be as much
about choice as it is about

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.790
ability, more so even that women
are actually choosing

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:21.740
actively not to pursue
roles in technology.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.910
So specifically when it comes to
computing, why do you feel

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:28.650
that women decide not to pursue
careers in technology?

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:30.815
SUE BLACK: Well, it's hard to
speak for women as a whole.

00:20:30.815 --> 00:20:35.675
But I guess my ideas around
that would be that they

00:20:35.675 --> 00:20:36.340
probably just don't know.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:40.850
They don't know what it is to
start with, how cool it is,

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:44.450
and how kind of empowering
technology can be, because you

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.600
don't need to know that much, I
think, really, to be able to

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:50.210
kind of take advantage
of technology.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:54.090
I think we've kind of got this
image of like typical

00:20:54.090 --> 00:20:56.810
programmers as like the typical
person in tech.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:20:59.670
And I think we need to move
away from that and kind of

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:01.540
change that stereotype.

00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:05.430
And so I think women
just don't realize

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.255
that they can do it.

00:21:06.255 --> 00:21:08.320
And they don't know what
it would do for

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.710
them if they could.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:14.095
I mean, with the 
Foundation, the charity that I

00:21:14.095 --> 00:21:19.200
set up, our next big project is
called TechMums, which is

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.160
all about getting mums a
bit more tech-savvy.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.590
And I've kind of found
throughout my career that when

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:30.210
I talk to people outside of my
sort of peer group in tech,

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.904
when I talk about being in
computing, quite a lot of

00:21:33.904 --> 00:21:37.445
people just kind of roll their
eyes at me or go politely and

00:21:37.445 --> 00:21:38.270
they're like, oh, god.

00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:40.170
You're so boring.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:43.420
Or they think I'm a boffin and
it's just something that they

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.120
could never do, or talk about
kind of IT failures that we've

00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:49.542
had over the years.

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:53.440
But you know, it is just such
a cool area to work in.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.990
And there are so many
different types of

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:56.020
opportunities.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.000
Everyone doesn't have
to be a programmer.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.670
I think it's good to understand
how software works,

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:08.190
and to understand basic things
like an algorithm, what an

00:22:08.190 --> 00:22:11.200
algorithm is, how software
works, that it's basically

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:15.480
just a list of instructions
and stuff that makes stuff

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:19.785
happen on a computer,
and a bit of kind

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:21.650
of web design skills.

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:24.320
I think most people can
do that kind of stuff.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.390
And actually, we ran a workshop
day with kids called

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:35.480
 Tech last year where we
had like 90 8-year-olds doing

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.570
basic programming in Scratch
and playing around with

00:22:39.570 --> 00:22:43.810
Raspberry Pis, and doing
a bit of app design

00:22:43.810 --> 00:22:45.200
with Apps for Good.

00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:49.680
And in a day, 90 kids learnt
to do some of this stuff.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.610
So if 8-year-old kids can
do it, women can do it.

00:22:52.610 --> 00:22:54.140
Mums can do it.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:55.560
We need to get that
message out there.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:56.930
And that's what TechMums
is all about.

00:22:56.930 --> 00:22:59.330
EZE VIDRA: If you look at the
newspaper as well, like most

00:22:59.330 --> 00:23:01.950
of the jobs that are the most
popular jobs today in social

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:06.320
media and in basic entry
level tech didn't

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.490
exist 10 years ago.

00:23:07.490 --> 00:23:11.060
So what would you recommend
maybe as part of your work

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:14.300
with  as well, to someone
entering the world of

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.290
tech, especially women entering
tech or considering

00:23:16.290 --> 00:23:16.890
to enter tech?

00:23:16.890 --> 00:23:19.210
Like what's the first step
that they need to take in

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:21.740
order to be more tech-savvy?

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.220
SUE BLACK: Well, I suppose I
would say do our TechMums

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.905
course, because it's all about
kind of hand-holding people

00:23:30.905 --> 00:23:35.790
over the sort of mental barrier
from thinking they

00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:38.660
don't understand it and they
can't do it to feeling that

00:23:38.660 --> 00:23:41.520
they're kind of empowered and
they know which way to go.

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.610
And so the idea is that we are
going to run a series of

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.280
workshops in a school,
Bishop Challoner

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.730
School in Tower Hamlets.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:52.955
And the aim is that we kind of
collect together everything

00:23:52.955 --> 00:23:55.530
that we've done and put into
a virtual box so that any

00:23:55.530 --> 00:23:58.910
organization can then run that
workshop themselves.

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:59.580
EZE VIDRA: That's great.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:03.630
SUE BLACK: And our aim is to
start small but build it up

00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:06.110
quickly so that we can get
it across the country.

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.858
So anyone can help with that.

00:24:07.858 --> 00:24:08.666
Let me know.

00:24:08.666 --> 00:24:09.070
MANDY WAITE: Yes, definitely.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:10.300
That would be really
interesting.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.870
I had a conversation recently,
I think it was in conjunction

00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:14.775
with women in tech, it may have
even been on one of the

00:24:14.775 --> 00:24:15.070
interviews.

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:16.355
I'll have [INAUDIBLE] check.

00:24:16.355 --> 00:24:19.220
But I mentioned that I felt it
was very important that we

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.580
start teaching the basics of
computing at a very early age,

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.580
almost the same time
as writing.

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.830
It's a fundamental skill.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:28.120
Interacting with the
technology in your

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.070
surroundings is a fundamental
skill that you're going to

00:24:30.070 --> 00:24:31.510
need as you grow up.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.860
And you've mentioned on the blog
that we're only reaching

00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:37.040
computer science
at GCSE level.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:40.040
Should we be doing more to teach
young people, very young

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:43.300
people, children in elementary
school, primary school?

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:43.770
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:44.380
Absolutely.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:44.990
Absolutely.

00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.810
I mean, I can't see-- you know,
like we read books to

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.380
kids and we teach them basic
maths from when they're

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:53.210
talking and like understanding
things.

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:57.300
So why not put some things
towards kind of technology

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.620
skills in that?

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:01.330
I mean, I had a conversation
on Twitter a while ago with

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.520
someone who was saying,
no, no, no.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:05.340
We shouldn't teach it before
a certain age.

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:08.650
And in our conversation they
kind of thought that I was

00:25:08.650 --> 00:25:11.110
saying we should teach C++ to
four-year-olds, which of

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.400
course I don't think
is a good idea.

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.020
But the thing is, like
understanding algorithms like

00:25:16.020 --> 00:25:18.940
I was saying before, so
understanding step-by-step

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:23.200
instructions-- where we can
teach our kids about cooking,

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.650
why can't we teach them
about algorithms?

00:25:25.650 --> 00:25:28.510
And then that can lead into a
conversation about software

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:34.330
and computing, because I think
teaching kids how to, I don't

00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.170
know, make a cake, you get your
ingredients together and

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.370
you do certain things
with them.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:40.480
And you end up with some
result at the end.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.010
Well, you know, that's kind of
around the mindset of what you

00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:44.550
would do if were writing
some code, if you

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:46.170
were writing a program.

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:48.060
And there's nothing wrong with
that, so why is there

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.740
something wrong with--

00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:53.375
I think it's just people not
really thinking about what it

00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:53.705
actually means.

00:25:53.705 --> 00:25:54.540
EZE VIDRA: It's interesting.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.790
In Estonia, for example, they
started teaching kids from the

00:25:57.790 --> 00:25:59.040
age of eight.

00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:00.190
And it's part of
the curriculum.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:03.850
But I guess one of the questions
that we get from

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:07.920
start-ups around technical
talent is, how do you think is

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.240
the curriculum a fit for then
getting a job in tech?

00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.620
Do you think that there's--
apart from starting them a

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.820
younger age, do you think there
needs to be changes to

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:20.590
the curriculum to equip them
for the actual jobs they're

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:21.350
going to do?

00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.521
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:21.580
Yes.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.370
Absolutely.

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:27.090
I mean, we're teaching math
skills at five and reading,

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:28.730
literacy, and that
kind of stuff.

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.160
So why can't technology
be in there as well?

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.420
And I think it should be.

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.230
And again, you can teach--

00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:36.000
you don't have to be
teaching coding.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.020
But you could be teaching
things, like, you know, we had

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:40.000
Logo back in the--

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:40.990
whenever.

00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:42.180
Some people are still
doing Logo.

00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:44.810
That kind of stuff.

00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:47.540
And even like the youngest kids,
you can talk to them

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:51.820
about step-by-step things
that they do.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.260
It doesn't have to
be about coding.

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.780
But I think about getting the
kind of key concepts in there,

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:59.740
kind of like hard-wired from
when they're young will help

00:26:59.740 --> 00:27:02.210
so much later on.

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.510
MANDY WAITE: I agree.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:04.715
I think technology is going to
change in such way that it

00:27:04.715 --> 00:27:06.800
won't be about programming
any more.

00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.990
The way you interact with things
will be much different

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.600
than writing code.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.680
But it will be very similar,
but everybody will be doing

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.760
it, just like what people
are doing on

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.430
their phones currently.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.530
SUE BLACK: Yes.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:16.960
Absolutely.

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.100
And the thing is, we kind of
all are starting to do that

00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:20.480
kind of stuff.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.930
We just don't realize that's
what it is, I think.

00:27:22.930 --> 00:27:25.300
So that's another message
to get over, really.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.730
EZE VIDRA: Yes.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.480
MANDY WAITE: So I have a crazy
question to ask you.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.080
It's probably going to
be the last question.

00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.946
Guys, how are we
doing for time?

00:27:32.946 --> 00:27:34.760
MALE SPEAKER: A few minutes.

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.540
MANDY WAITE: We've got
a few minutes left.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:35.940
That's excellent.

00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:37.770
So I'm going to ask
you this question.

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:40.070
You said you think you'd
be able to answer it.

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.515
SUE BLACK: Oh, gosh.

00:27:40.515 --> 00:27:42.440
I've forgotten what it was.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.510
MANDY WAITE: Well, I read on
your Posterous blog that you

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.450
love learning about the
history of computing.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:49.650
And so thanks to you and thanks
to Lynette Webb, I've

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.850
been introduced into that
rich history as well.

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.230
It's amazing.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:54.940
I absolutely share
that passion.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.070
I just wish I had more
time to pursue it.

00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:01.870
But say like in 100 years, what
will historians be saying

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:05.242
and writing about this
particular era in the history

00:28:05.242 --> 00:28:06.565
of computing?

00:28:06.565 --> 00:28:08.168
SUE BLACK: I'd forgotten
you said you were

00:28:08.168 --> 00:28:10.900
going to ask that.

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:15.870
I guess I think it will all be
about when we really connected

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.820
to each other, so kind of the
social media thing, but kind

00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:23.590
of on a really big scale,
because we can now find so

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:24.840
much information.

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.150
We can now connect to
so many people.

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:32.570
I mean, I think search is just
amazing, and not just because

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:35.700
we can look up what we want to
buy at the shops or something,

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:39.830
or something on Wikipedia, but
because once everyone across

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.200
the world gets online, which is
happening gradually, we'll

00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:46.840
be able to find anything and
anyone anywhere and then

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:51.210
connect up in ways that we
can't even imagine yet.

00:28:51.210 --> 00:28:54.360
But there's just so much
information out there and the

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.030
ability to search it, that I
think that's going to be-- the

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:00.130
kind of connecting everybody and
everything up together is

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:01.540
going to be the big thing
that's kind of

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.616
happened at this time.

00:29:03.616 --> 00:29:04.082
MANDY WAITE: OK.

00:29:04.082 --> 00:29:05.014
That's excellent.

00:29:05.014 --> 00:29:07.850
I totally agree.

00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.530
Before we wrap up, do you want
to actually say anything about

00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:11.510
what you're actually working
in currently?

00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:12.750
SUE BLACK: Well, TechMums,
I've been

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.470
plugging that really hard.

00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:17.080
That's our latest project.

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:17.390
Yes.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:22.240
So we'll be running a TechMums
workshop and putting TechMums

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.550
in a virtual box.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.570
So if anyone wants to help us
with that, or across the

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:31.020
country wants to get involved in
terms of running some sort

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.640
of workshops or hosting
a workshop or even

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.800
participating, then please
get in touch.

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:37.690
MANDY WAITE: Awesome.

00:29:37.690 --> 00:29:38.890
Well, thank you Sue.

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:40.230
And wonderful to have
you along today.

00:29:40.230 --> 00:29:41.270
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.400
MANDY WAITE: Thank you,
Eze, for stepping in.

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:42.650
EZE VIDRA: Thank you.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:43.825
Thanks for having me.

00:29:43.825 --> 00:29:44.100
Nice to meet you.

00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:44.550
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.410
Yes, you too.

00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:47.170
MANDY WAITE: Thank you,
everybody, from Campus London.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:47.970
My name's Mandy Waite.

00:29:47.970 --> 00:29:49.580
Eze Vidra, and Sue Black.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:49.850
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:51.100
EZE VIDRA: Thank you.
