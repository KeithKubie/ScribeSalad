00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.840
 In this video, I want to solve some of the issues that contain 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.200
 On the properties of the foundations 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.860
 But, before doing so, let's do 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.970
 A quick review of what the basics are 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.380
 Suppose I have 2 ^ 3 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.630
 You might say, is this worth 6? 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.010
 I will tell you no, not worth 6 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.580
 But this means that the 2 multiplied by itself three times 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.940
 Ie Sisawe 2 × 2 × 2, where 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.549
 2 x 2 = 4 

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:35.220
 4 × 2 = 8 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.090
 If you ask, how much output 3 ^ 2? 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.110
 It means you will hit 3 herself twice 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.220
 Ie 3 x 3 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.030
 It is equal to 9 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.060
 Let's do one more solution 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.080
 I think you've absorbed the general idea, if you have not 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.080
 I've seen this before 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:03.020
 Suppose I have 5 ^ 7 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.120
 Which is equal to 5 multiplied by itself seven times 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:16.280
 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.960
 These seven times, right? 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.200
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560
 The output will be quite a very large number 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.710
 I will not calculate it now 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.470
 If you want to count it yourself, it is up to you 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.620
 Or use the calculator to do this, but assure you that output 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.320
 very big 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.400
 So what you will quickly recognize is 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.000
 The foundations raise the value of the numbers quickly 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.700
 The V517 would produce a huge and massive number 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.920
 But in any case, this was a simple review of the basics 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.130
 Let us now go deeper into algebra, using the foundations 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.610
 Let's say 3x output - let me do this in a different color - 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:59.670
 How much output is 3x × 3x × 3x? 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.340
 Well, the thing you should remember about the beating 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.990
 Is, that ranking does not matter when you do an operation 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 Multiply 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.440
 So the issue can be written in the following picture 3 × 3 × 3 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.550
 X x x x x x 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.620
 The issue of ranking is due to us, this part 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.160
 Here, 3 × 3 × 3, equals 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.780
 3 ^ 3 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.210
 This part, x multiplied by itself three times 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.750
 X x 3 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.050
 The result can be written as follows 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.570
 3 ^ 3 × x ^ 3 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.960
 Or if you know the output of 3 ^ 3, which is 9 × 3 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.240
 It is equal to 27 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.180
 The final output is 27x ^ 3 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.840
 Maybe you're saying now, it's not a matter of 3x × 3x × 3x 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.830
 Ie (3x) ^ 3? 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:53.140
 is not it? 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.480
 I beat 3x herself three times 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.560
 I will tell you, yes it is 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.210
 These can be interpreted as 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.730
 (3x) ^ 3 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.950
 Thus, we have dealt with one 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.280
 Of the characteristics of the foundations 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.290
 They gave this 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.600
 When I have a number multiplied by a number, and every amount 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.430
 Raised to power 3, this equals every value of them 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.490
 3 These values ​​are multiplied by each other 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.290
 If (3x) ^ 3 equals 3 ^ 3 × 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.860
 x ^ 3, ie 27x ^ 3 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.730
 Let us solve more examples 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:39.050
 What if you asked how much output 6 ^ 3 × 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.410
 6 ^ 6? 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.860
 The output will be quite huge, but I want 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.480
 Write it in a number that is raised to power 6 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.290
 Let me write 6 ^ 6 in a different color 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.460
 6 ^ 3 × 6 ^ 6, km 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.540
 Result of the matter? 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.200
 Well, 6 ^ 3, we know it's about 6 multiplied 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.880
 Herself three times 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.400
 Ie 6 × 6 × 6 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.440
 This amount is multiplied by - I will write the multiplication signal 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.060
 In green 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.430
 Use orange to write two numbers 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.990
 This equals 6 × 6 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.430
 Well, how much output 6 ^ 6? 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.540
 He's 6 multiplied by herself six times 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:27.180
 Ie 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 × 6 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.380
 × 6 Other 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.620
 How much would it be? 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.740
 Well, we'll beat 6 here by herself 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.560
 How many times? 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.650
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.640
 Eight, nine times, right? 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.450
 Three times here, plus 6 times 

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.450
 If we hit her own nine times 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.910
 3 + 6 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.360
 This equals 6 ^ 3 + 6 or 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.100
 6 ^ 9 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.650
 And so we have touched on 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.130
 Another property of the properties of the foundations 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.100
 In this case, when we dealt with the foundations, 6 ^ 3 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:05.760
 The number 6 was the foundation 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.190
 Ie we took the raised basis of force 3 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:11.900
 When we multiply two numbers 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.360
 They have the same foundation, in which case the foundations are gathered 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.850
 Let me resolve several issues on this 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.020
 I will use purple 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.420
 Suppose I have 2 ^ 2 × 2 ^ 4 × 

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.030
 2 ^ 6 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.840
 Well, we have the same foundation for all these values, if 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.340
 We can gather the foundations 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.490
 This equals 2 ^ 2 + 4 + 6 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.970
 It is equal to 2 ^ 12 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.680
 This is logical, because we have 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.440
 2 multiplied by herself twice, 2 multiplied by herself four times 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.880
 And 2 multiplied by itself six times 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.000
 When we multiply all these values, output 2 will be multiplied by itself 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.350
 12 times, or 2 ^ 12 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.740
 Let me do it briefly, using some 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.150
 Variables, but the idea remains the same 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.570
 How much is x ^ 2 or x ^ 2 × x ^ 4 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.610
 Well, we can use the property we learned 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.060
 We have the same foundation, ie x 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.300
 Thus the output will be x ^ 2 + 4 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.100
 Ie x ^ 6 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.380
 If you do not believe me, how much is x ^ 2 output? 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.210
 x ^ 2 = x x x 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.110
 If we want to hit this b 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.630
 x ^ 4, means that we will multiply the amount by x multiplied by itself four times 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:46.200
 x x x x x x x 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:49.560
 In the end, how many times will we beat X herself? 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.470
 Well, one, two, three, four, five, six times 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.280
 x ^ 6 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.470
 Let's have one more solution 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.280
 It is better for us to solve more examples 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.760
 We now move on to the next property, even 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.590
 We combine it with other properties 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:14.320
 Suppose I have (a ^ 3) ^ 4 

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.610
 I will tell you what the property is, and explain why 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.450
 Are logical 

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:19.880
 When we raise the number of a particular bass, then raise 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.680
 The whole amount is for another, so we can strike the foundations 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:28.160
 Here the output will be a ^ 3 × 4 ie 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.020
 a ^ 12 

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.730
 What is considered logical? 

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:35.340
 Well, because we have a ^ 3 here 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.820
 Multiplied by itself four times 

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:41.330
 Which equals a ^ 3 × a ^ 3 

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.300
 × a ^ 3 × a ^ 3 

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:48.430
 Well, we have the same foundation, so we can gather the foundations 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:52.620
 Ie the output will be ^ 3 × 4 

00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:57.910
 This equals a ^ 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:03.600
 It is the same as 3 x 4 

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.010
 Which equals a ^ 12 

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.580
 Let's review the characteristics we learned 

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.560
 In this lesson, along with a review 

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:19.830
 The basics, if we had x ^ a × b 

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.550
 This will equal 

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:25.120
 x ^ a + b 

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.950
 We have seen this here 

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:30.615
 x ^ 2 × x ^ 4 = 

00:08:30.615 --> 00:08:32.490
 x ^ 6, ie the output of 2 + 4 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:39.500
 We also saw that if we had (x x y) ^ a 

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:42.440
 This is equivalent to x ^ a 

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.680
 × y ^ a 

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.810
 We've seen it in this video 

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.570
 Here at the top 

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:53.000
 3x ^ 3 is equivalent to 3 ^ 3 × 

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.130
 x ^ 3 

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.410
 That's all I said before 

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.460
 3x ^ 3 is equivalent to 3 ^ 3 × 

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:01.730
 x ^ 3 

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.720
 And the last property 

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:10.710
 If we have x ^ a and then raise all the amount of force b 

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:15.430
 Equals x ^ a × b 

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.460
 We also saw this, where if we had a ^ 3 and raised it 

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.690
 For force 4, this is equal to a ^ 3 × 4 

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:25.280
 Ie a ^ 12 

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.970
 So let's apply these properties to a set of 

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:48.070
 More complex issues. For example, say (2xy) ^ 2 × 

00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:55.060
 (-x ^ 2 y) ^ 2 × 

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.900
 (3x ^ 2 y ^ 2) 

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.330
 We want to simplify them 

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:04.980
 And the best value to start with is to simplify 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:07.550
 This phrase is to make it look 

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:08.930
 -1 × x ^ 2 × y ^ 2 

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:13.350
 If we took this part and we squared it, that would be 

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:15.670
 As each statement of power is raised separately 2 

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:19.590
 If this part can be simplified to -1 ^ 2 

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:26.320
 X x ^ 2 × y ^ 2 

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.270
 Hence if we simplify it, -1 ^ 2 

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:31.890
 = 1, x ^ 2-- Remember that you can 

00:10:31.890 --> 00:10:35.100
 To hit the foundations - equals 

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.770
 x ^ 4 y ^ 2 

00:10:37.770 --> 00:10:40.345
 This is simplifying the middle part 

00:10:40.345 --> 00:10:43.760
 Let us now see if it can be combined with other parts 

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:47.410
 The other parts are, 2xy ^ 2 

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:51.350
 And 3x ^ 2 y ^ 2 

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.380
 Well, now we can continue 

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.400
 Multiply the values ​​together 

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.710
 We have learned that it is in the multiplication process 

00:10:56.710 --> 00:10:58.860
 The order of values ​​does not matter 

00:10:58.860 --> 00:10:59.930
 So I can change the order 

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.150
 We will hit 2 × x × y ^ 2 

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.600
 X x ^ 4 × y ^ 2 × 3 × 

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.550
 x ^ 2 × y ^ 2 

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:10.290
 I can rearrange this arrangement 

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:11.800
 In a way that makes simplification easier 

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.995
 I can hit 2 × 3, and then go to 

00:11:16.995 --> 00:11:18.610
 Phrases x 

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:19.960
 Let me use this color 

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:30.330
 I have x x x x ^ 4 x x ^ 2 

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:36.080
 Now y, y × 2 

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:40.036
 × y ^ 2 × y ^ 2 

00:11:40.036 --> 00:11:42.950
 × y ^ 2 again 

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:44.600
 Now what is the outcome of this? 

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.880
 Well, 2 x 3 

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.200
 Of course we know how much they produce 

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.330
 Equals 6 

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:53.450
 The output of x × x ^ 4 × x ^ 2 

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.310
 Well, the thing to remember here is that x is about 

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:57.340
 x ^ 1 

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:00.480
 For any number raised to Force 1, the output is the same number 

00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.130
 As you know, 2 ^ 1 = 2 

00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:05.970
 And 3 ^ 1 = 3 

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.780
 How much is this? 

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.190
 Equally - we have the same foundation as x 

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:19.760
 So we can combine the bases, x ^ 1 + 4 + 2 

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.250
 I will combine in the next step 

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:25.510
 Then the y statements, 

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.100
 × y ^ 2 + 2 + 2 

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.120
 How much will the product? 

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.840
 It will be 6x ^ 7 

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:39.250
 y ^ 6 

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:41.310
 I will leave you with a question and I think you 

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.290
 You know his answer, which is interesting 

00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:44.900
 What happens when we raise 

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:46.710
 Number of strength 0? 

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:50.360
 If I assume I have 7 ^ 0, how much is equal? 

00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:52.350
 I will tell you - this shows that 

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:56.820
 Obviously - equal to 1, and 1 ^ 0 

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:58.740
 Equals 1 too 

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:01.600
 Any number is raised to 0, I mean any number other than zero 

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:06.060
 When lifting the force 0 will be produced 1 

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.230
 This will give you some 

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.320
 Intuition for Reason 

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.460
 Think of it this way 

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.100
 3 Let me write the powers 

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.260
 Or 2 or 3 

00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:23.800
 We will use base 3 

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.420
 If 3 ^ 1 = 3 

00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:26.340
 I think this is logical 

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.760
 3 ^ 2 = 9 

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.610
 3 ^ 3 = 27 

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.590
 Of course, we try to find an output 

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:35.700
 3 ^ 0 

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:36.410
 Think about it 

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:39.040
 Each time we subtract the value of the exponent 

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.680
 Each time we subtract the value of the exponent by 1, therefore 

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.160
 We divide by 3 

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.640
 Let's move from 27 to 9, divide by 3 

00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:48.000
 Let's move from 9 to 3, also divide by 3 

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.400
 So if we move from this expanse to that, we may have to 

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.630
 Divide on 3 again 

00:13:51.630 --> 00:13:54.950
 Therefore, any number we raise to force 0, and in these 

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:58.050
 Our case, 3 ^ 0 = 1 

00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:59.940
 See you in the next view
