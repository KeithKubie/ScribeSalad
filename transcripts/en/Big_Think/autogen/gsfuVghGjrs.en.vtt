and so as I've already alluded I think

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500
and so as I've already alluded I think
 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.020
and so as I've already alluded I think
it's it's our human destiny to to go

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030
it's it's our human destiny to to go
 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.910
it's it's our human destiny to to go
beyond earth to hopefully create a an

beyond earth to hopefully create a an
 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.560
beyond earth to hopefully create a an
outpost on the moon similar to what we

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
outpost on the moon similar to what we
 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.570

have the South Pole that where we could

have the South Pole that where we could
 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.300
have the South Pole that where we could
conduct deep-space research and also

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310
conduct deep-space research and also
 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.360
conduct deep-space research and also
create a waypoint to resupply spacecraft

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370
create a waypoint to resupply spacecraft
 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.720
create a waypoint to resupply spacecraft
that could travel further on to Mars and

wouldn't it be amazing if we could send

wouldn't it be amazing if we could send
 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.770
wouldn't it be amazing if we could send
a spacecraft and/or crew there and

some simple life forms there is quite
high that would change everything to

high that would change everything to
 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.020
high that would change everything to

we're discovering these exoplanets
