00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.283
The two main brain regions involved in schizophrenia are the prefrontal cortex

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:08.980
and the hippocampus. If you remember, the prefrontal cortex is involved in

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.824
working memory, paying attention and staying focused and organizing our

00:00:12.824 --> 00:00:17.520
thoughts. People suffering from schizophrenia have disfunction in this region

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.451
of the brain. Secondly, people with schizophrenia often have smaller

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.928
hippocampi, which affects learning and memory and can lead to some of the

00:00:24.928 --> 00:00:28.710
disorganized thinking seen in schizophrenia.
