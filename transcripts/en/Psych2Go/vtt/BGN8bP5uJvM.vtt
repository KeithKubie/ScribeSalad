00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.880
Fact: An Anti-social is someone who doesn't care and violates others while in asocial is someone who doesn't like to socialize

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.920
I am guilty of making this mistake and confusing the two terms too before

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.949
I used to think that an anti-social refers to someone who doesn't like to socialize

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:37.020
But it turns out that in the field of psychology the proper term for someone who doesn't like to talk is called an asocial

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.809
anti-social behavior or anti-social personality disorder ASPD

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.919
is diagnosed as a personality disorder in which the person exhibits a lack of conscience for wrong-doings

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.909
an individual's personality becomes overwhelmed by an abnormal

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.839
mentality that causes negative patterns of behavior

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.680
ASPD, typically manifests during late childhood to early adolescence and continues into adulthood

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.010
according to the National Institute of health NIH

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.879
people who are diagnosed with antisocial behavior often display patterns of not only resistance to authority

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.549
but also frequent manipulation

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.239
exploitation and violation of rights of others

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.509
The exact cause of ASPD is unknown because there are many genetic and environmental

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.900
Factors that affect the development of this disorder a person is a greater risk of developing anti-social personality

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.949
if they are male, was abused as a child, have parents who also have ASPD, or

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.828
grew up with alcoholic adult figures

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.680
children with ASPD tend to display cruelty towards animals as well as have a high tendency to enjoy setting

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.670
illegal fires

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.809
symptoms that manifest in adults include frequent bursts of anger, arrogance, manipulation with remorse,

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.618
aggressive behavior and violent tendencies, no regard to personal safety or the safety of others and

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.788
lack of guilt or regret of any wrong-doings

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.469
some examples anti-social behavior include but are not limited to

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.050
harassing, conning, lying, bullying, etc. others, here's a list.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.950
However in my own non-professional opinion

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.630
someone who is anti-social carries similar characteristics as

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.669
psychopaths namely someone who hurts others without any clear or logical motives. On the other hand

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:46.410
asocial is a term to describe a person's behavior that is characterized by the deliberate avoidance of social interaction

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.040
people who are diagnosed as a social tend to be inconsiderate or quite hostile towards others

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.000
asocial behavior is frequently observed in people who suffer from personality autism spectrum or

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.690
mood disorders some include schizophrenia, depression,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.159
autism, asperger syndrome and social anxiety disorder

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.130
Here are some questions to ponder about

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.329
How does anti-social behavior link to psychopathy?

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.879
What is the line between someone who is just displaying anti-social behaviors because they are still young or having personal problems,

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.359
versus someone with early signs of psychopathy?
