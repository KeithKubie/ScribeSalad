Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. Hi, I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today, oh, I dunno what we're talking about. We're in a doubtful state of mind. Constant doubt. That's the topic. Yes. Like in the last chapter, we met a person who had a real a doubt pile up. He lost his faith in God. He lost his girl. This may be an extreme example of something that we all go through every day, right? Yeah. I mean you wake up and then you have to get something done and then some little voice inside you says, you know, you can't do this. Sure about this, but still you gotta act cause you're an adult. So what do you do in that case? How do you act without the feeling of certainty? Hello? Hi, Mr Sanny. Yes. Okay. And we met someone who thinks about this all the time. This is an area that I'm pretty well versed in.

Speaker 1:          00:45          Would this be your stock in trade? This would be very much so. Her name is Annie Duke. I'm a decision strategist. But you might know her better as a bad ass poker player. Well in 2004 I won a bracelet which is a a world championship. I also won the tournament of champions that year. That was the cheers one a lot. Now when we call up Annie, we had this idea about poker that I think a lot of people have, which is that it's like this game about tills like reading your opponent, watching the way their nose quivers so that you can tell when they're bluffing or when they've got a good hand. Nope. Taos are actually a very small part of the game fact. She says they often backfire. I remember the first tournament I played after it was on TV, I had a hand that was kind of a close decision and this guy moved all of his chips into the pot and God, he was just confident like I could see like he was really confident in his hand, so I threw my hand away.

Speaker 1:          01:44          But then in a subsequent game she sees the same guy doing exactly the same thing. He pushes all his chips in looking super confident. I was like, wow, he must have like a crazy hand, like two aces. And he turns his hand over face up and he's super confident in it. And it was a really bad hand. It was just the hand that he thought was good. So the problem for me was that I read him totally correctly, but what I didn't understand was that he didn't, let's call him inexperienced, he didn't know what a good hand or a bad hand was. But then you get players who are a little bit more experienced and sometimes they would do what's called a reverse towel. Is it like a double fake? Right? They'd basically pretend to be overconfident. So she think they're dumb and I'm in the Biz. They call that hollywooding. So she says, unless you've played someone a million times, it's really hard to know how to read them and what's worse. The good players, they do nothing. Doing nothing is the best choice, which you try to disappear. You pick a spot on the table, stare at it. What do you do in the case where there aren't any signals to read? And the only thing you really know is that you know nothing. Well actually what you sort of figure out is that you don't need to know.

Speaker 1:          02:56          The real breakthrough moment for me was when I stopped trying to figure out anything with certainty. And here any laid out a way of thinking, I just leave caming doubt that we find completely fascinating. And that has paid off for her to the tune of about $4 million. Huh. Well, you know, I think that, do you mind if we just back up? Okay. Like how did you get to be Annie Duke? Um, well I was, I was born Annie letterer and then I married someone with the last name Duke and thought that's much easier to be Annie Duke. Well, I went to Columbia Undergrad, double major in English literature and Psychology, psychology. Then I went to U Penn, studied cognitive psychology there. I had a national science foundation fellowship. And then right at the end, um, just really had this realization that I didn't really want to be an academic holy hell. Like what am I going to do now? Okay, well I need some money. I'll play some poker while I'm figuring it out. And as you played a lot of poker to that point, no, but I'd watch my brother play a lot.

Speaker 2:          03:57          Well she, she would come out and she would sit behind and watch. That's Annie's brother. This is Howard Howard letter sounds exactly like his sister, but with a deeper voice.

Speaker 1:          04:06          He started mentoring me a little bit. Um, and I started making money right away. She was very competitive. I think your mother tearing out her hair at this point or was she agreed at that point? My parents had just given up hope. My brother when he was 18, he, my grandfather, grandfather had the family, a $2,000 check for the two of us to help with college. And um, my brother gambled it away

Speaker 2:          04:28          and a little poke around in the back room. Well that might've been the very early phase. I was a terrible poker player. It has since become a very decorated, open player. And he's also been in the news recently because an online poker company, he was associated with cold, full tilt. So we've gotten into some legal difficulties. But back when he was starting, so I started, he says he would play in these tiny little games 36 hours straight, which was not atypical for me back then and it was all very seat of the pants. But I, but I, I arrived in this wonderful situation, fortunate he happened to be learning the game, which you would later teach to his sister at a time, you know, 1983 1984 when the game was changing radically.

Speaker 3:          05:09          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:09          poker poker was this Texas gambler thing happening in Vegas. Like the Cliche we just talked about, you know, that you play with your gut with the Texas Dolly and Amarillo slim and who knows what's going on over there. But then like in so many other things, the geeks took over.

Speaker 4:          05:27          Okay,

Speaker 2:          05:28          well, you know, there were these games, I was playing it and I was, people will peg the change to different times, different places. But for Howard, it began in New York. Yup. When he joined this regular game, but huge game. These are Wall Street traders, world champion, bridge players, brilliant people. They get together after Wall Street, closed play for about eight hours. Then go to a bar and carefully deconstruct the eight hours they just played, you know, hey, what were you thinking in that? Why did you do that? Why you you, you weren't really bluffing, but you made this big bet w and out of those conversations

Speaker 1:          05:58          came the style of play that you now find everywhere. Yeah. Hold on. Okay, let, listen. If you Google the phrase right now, hold them odds chart, you're going to be able to give him, hold him, hold him, hold him odds chart. We ended up talking to our friend Mike about all this. My name is Mike [inaudible]. I cover sports for NPR and he's also spent a fair amount of time in underground poker clubs. By the way, it's always a misnomer cause in New York City they're always on the ninth floor of an office building or something like that. Anyway, he showed us these, these charts. Yeah. Okay, and what my God, look at this thing. What is it? It's like my nightmare. It's like a spreadsheet with tons and tons of numbers. Well first I'll say this, but Mike says, don't be afraid. These charts, this is how you achieve zen in an uncertain world.

Speaker 1:          06:43          Okay, let's say, let me give you a situation. Let me give you a situation. You're playing the game of hold'em and there's only one card to come. The river card that is the last card and hold them. And you figure in fact just explained in Texas hold'em, each player gets two secret cards that they can see and the dealer puts down a bunch of a community cards one by one that everyone can see. And the game is who can combine their secret cards with the community cards to make the best hand. Exactly. Now say one of your secret cards is a heart. And on the board, the community cards include three, three hearts. Okay, I've got one in my hand that's for dealers about the deal. Another card. And if the last card is a heart, well damn, I would have a flush. So I want to know what are the odds of me getting that last heart.

Speaker 1:          07:31          Every decent poker player will know how to calculate this automatically. And for the non decent ones, Weldon, there's the chart. You know there are 13 of every suit in the deck. You know there are 13 hearts in the deck and there are three hearts on the board. One of my hand. That means that you can figure that there are 30 minus three minus one nine cards in the deck out of the 46 that we don't know about that can complete my flush. Now look at this chart I'm looking at nine. Number nine is all the way to the right nine flush draw night. So when you do the odds that you wind up having a about a 20% chance of victory of getting that last heart. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          08:09          Uh,

Speaker 1:          08:09          okay. So what do you do in this circumstance? Am I one more time? What am I in my odds? Your odds are 20% you bet. Do you go for it? Do you stay in, be bold or do you fold? I personally, I fall totally at fault. Of course you fall. I walk away. Get out of there. I quit the game. Live to fight another day. Exactly. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not necessarily. Every poker. And he says there are times when 2020 5% sure means bet. Bet. Bet. I know that sounds counterintuitive. So let me explain what I mean. And this is the none of it right here. Let's say that someone bats $100 and there's already $200 in the pot. Okay? That means that for you continue with your hand, you have to put in $100. So if you win the pot, you'll win $300 and if you lose the pot, you'll lose $100 right?

Speaker 1:          09:06          In order to break even, you could lose the pot three times because you'd lose $100 three times. So that would be negative 300 and you could win the pot once. That makes sense, right? Cause you're going to get 300 and then you would break even. So you could lose $100 on Monday, $100 on Tuesday. You lose another a hundred on when they, but if you win the 300 back on Thursday, yeah, you're good. You just need to win one out of every four times, so that means that you have to win the pot 25% of the time. Those are your pot odds. Pot odds are what dictates good bets. The amount that's in the pot determines how certain you have to be that your hand is good, which is a really cool concept I think because if you're pot odds are 25% and all you really need to be is 25% sure that you have a good hand, which you are in the hearts case.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Sometimes you have to be 40% sure. Sometimes you have to be 30% sure you know if there's $70 in the pot and you only have to call 10 you know now you're in the 15% range in terms of how certain you have to be. That your hand is good. In that case, you can bet this hand that you really not sure about knowing that while you might lose this time, if I do that a million times in my poker life, the law of high numbers indicates that I'm going to be very much a winner in the long run. It might be the very long run, but you should be ahead in the long run because it's not. It's not about winning the hand all the time. It's about winning the hand enough at the time. That is what she got watching her brother. I'm sure that I'm just quoting him and that's warm comfort. I mean that's, that's weird. So the man, the probabilities or what you carry it care about most. Yeah, because that sort of embracing of uncertainty [inaudible] some really wonderful things for you. If you're in a situation where you only have to have the best hand 25% of the time. If you're playing well, you're going to have a bad hand a lot of the time. It's okay.

Speaker 1:          10:54          It's actually a relevant and that's really the big bonus of this way of thinking. You begin to learn how to avoid that very human tendency to feel shamed.

Speaker 2:          11:03          There is when you lose, you just float right above it.

Speaker 1:          11:09          If you're making good decisions, then you're making good decisions. You have to be somewhat outcome blind, but sometimes that's not so easy. Yeah. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          11:22          there is no event on the planet like it. 2004 the world series of poker, biggest tournament in all of poker. What a tournament this is, they handle emotionally. Three people at the table and he Duke. This guy, Phil Hellmuth is a big player and and his brother Howard, they've played together for so long. It never for 2 million, never been in this type of position. The 2 million is an alive, they get their cards and hey, Duke was sixes. I had two. Six is pretty good hand and she'll open with 70,000 big fat opening bet over to Phil. Phil thinks no, they'll help me with immediately gets out of the way again. He folds over to our letter room and here's where things get interesting. Instead of folding like that Guy Phil, my brother moved in on me. Howard goes all in against his sister. Decision now to Andy with the pocket sixes.

Speaker 2:          12:15          Any things? Should I stay in? Should I bail? Well, mathematically, two six is actually rates to be the best hand there. So brother, it's on. Yeah. However, when they turn over their cards and remember she has two sixes actually he's got a seven and it turned out he had two seven. Yup. That's what he wants. A four to one favorite. And Annie knows she's in trouble, her brother in a commanding position and he was 82% to win the hand. They both knew that if they play this hand a hundred times, he's gonna win about 82 of them. The only thing that can save her is if the dealer now turns over a sixth is 18% chance and here comes the flop.

Speaker 2:          13:00          Dealer turns, blueprints, the cards and he gets her six at a full house. Oh God. And she immediately feels horrendous for her brother and I won the hand. And that's the end of the line for a Howard Lederer, Annie Duke Knox or big brother out in the video. You see her getting up from the table? She hugs her brother. Oh, this is very difficult for Annie. I want to, you see her emotions and you must have mixed about that failure. Look, I was 82% when that pot. That was incredibly, I'm like, yeah, and she my sister too. I taught her how to do that. Yeah, no, I wanted to win that hand. That's, that's for sure. I, I was upset when my mom watched that. She called me up and she was like in tears and she was like, how could you knock your brother out of the tournament?

Speaker 2:          13:59          And I was like, I now I know your favorite is now. Here's the thing. If you, if your superior cards do not win the day, you know we have vocabulary to deal with that. It's called a bad beat. A bad beat. A bad beat is when you had the cards that should've won and you got beat. Wow. There's a term that should catch on right there. If, say in stock investing you were to say, look, you, you invested for all the right reasons, but the stock went down because someone you'd never heard of shorted it. That was a bad beat. Do you know what, I wonder what, like, you know, this whole, uh, rigorous probabilistic way of thinking, is that something that you just acquire once you know the math or do you have to first be of a certain cast of mind in order to Kinda get into it? Well, that's, I'm not sure it would work for me. You have to be from a pretty unusual family techno to get constellation that

Speaker 1:          14:51          I'll tell you what our family's like. So, um, my brother and my brother in law both knew my boyfriend before we, me and my boyfriend started dating. OK. And they, when they found out we were going on a date, they made a market for what the probability was that we would actually end up together together. That he was willing to give me $27. If they get married, I have to give him a hundred. I was offering 73 to 27 what is wrong with you? And I was like, are you insane? We haven't gone on a date together. Exactly. They've never gone on a date yet. I made one of the best bets ever. I assume you'd be happy to lose that then. I'm going to be, I'm going to be thrilled. But, but that's how gamblers think. I mean, it's not a bad way or taints anything, it's just, that's the way that we memorialize the fact that we had a fundamental difference of opinion

Speaker 3:          15:55          that works. You know, if you're bidding on your sister's marital status I suppose, but if, if it's, uh, if it's bigger stakes, like going back to the beginning of the program where we were concerned with the presence or on presence of God, that's not a mathematical thing.

Speaker 6:          16:11          Oh, well I'm not so sure that's true, Sarah. And what'd you like to say something? They're there. You know, there was a guy named Pascal, I don't know if you've ever heard of them. They have who thought that you could do exactly that. So he was one of the first thinkers of probability. So all this stuff we've been talking about, but he at some point was also struggling with the question of God and he couldn't decide for sure. He always thought there was a chance that he did exist, a chance he didn't. So he didn't know what to do. So he came up with an idea. He said, if I decided to believe him, him [inaudible] all right. In that scenario, if he exists eternal forever, happy, happy. If you believe in him and he happens to be there, then you win. You win the pot big time forever.

Speaker 6:          16:52          Like infinite. Now, if I decide to not believe in God, that's my other option. [inaudible] and now I'm a not believer. If he does exist and you don't believe very, very, very infinite, bad, eternal damnation forever, you go to hell, then you go to hell. So there's a huge infinite payoff to believing in God and there's an infinite downside to not believing in God the pot eyes. So no matter how I speak, yes, because no matter how unlikely it is that God actually exists, this is like Annie having an infinite amount of money on the table. No matter how bad her cards are, how unlikely is she thinks she'll win? You gotta Bet. You have to bet the pot. Odds are saying that you must believe in God is what you're is. That's what Pascal said. Pascal said, if you do the math the way Andy does the math, believe in God.

Speaker 6:          17:44          What are the pot odds on God? But that's ridiculous, by the way. You know? That's ridiculous. [inaudible] why? Because you've Kels, faith is lesser his. His belief in God because he got to it through math is somehow lesser than, I don't know, say Saint Augustine or someone you were spending less because, because we're talking here about grace and love and being connected, and it's, it is. It is a daredevily heart of your hearts full of emotion. That's what rules here, and that's what guide you. It is not calculating the odds. The od Sir looking pretty a divine right now.
