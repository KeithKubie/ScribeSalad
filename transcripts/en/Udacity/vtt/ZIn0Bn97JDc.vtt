00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.070
So, stochastic games, originally due to Shappley, have a bunch

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.790
of different quantities. State, actions,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.310
transitions, rewards, and discount factors. And

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:09.860
here's how we're going to do it. We're going to, we're going to

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.760
say that s, little s, is, is one of the states.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.650
And actions could be like little a, but actually, since

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.180
we're going to focus mostly on two player games for the moment,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.370
I'm going to write actions as a and b. Where a

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.230
is an action for player one and b is an action

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.600
for player two. Sound okay?

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.310
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.410
&gt;&gt; Alright. So next we have the transition function.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.990
So, the transition function says: If you're in some

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:35.900
state, s, and there's some joint action that's taken,

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.890
like all the players choose their action simultaneously, a comma

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.490
b, then what's the probability of reaching some next

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.970
state s prime? And we can write rewards the same

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.070
way. So there's reward for player one, given that

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.120
we're in state s and there's a joint action ab.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.410
And there's the reward for the other player, the second player.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.190
And a discount factor is you know, like a discount factor.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.888
&gt;&gt; Totally makes sense. So oh its the same discount factor for everyone.

00:00:59.888 --> 00:01:03.870
&gt;&gt; Yes! Good a good point. One need not define things

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.840
that way, but in fact that is the way it's always defined.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.450
&gt;&gt; Hey, not to go of on a tangent here, but sometimes I see

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.460
NDP's and things like stochastic games defined

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.180
with a discount Factor being a part

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.700
of the definition, and sometimes not. Like it's just a part of

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.190
the prob, definition of the problem or sometimes its a parameter of an

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.160
algorithm. Which do you prefer? Why do you, why haven't, why have

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.220
the discount factor actually listed as part of the definition of the game?

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.520
&gt;&gt; I have no justification other than it's nice to

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.420
have listed the things that might be important as oppose to

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.540
you know, working through algorithms for while and then saying,

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.480
oh yeah there's this other number that kind of matters too.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.270
&gt;&gt; Okay

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.420
that's fair. I was just curious. So one of the things that I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.790
actually find really interesting is that this model was laid out by Shapley.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:47.373
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.590
&gt;&gt; One of the, like a former Nobel prize winner. I guess

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.750
once you're a Nobel prize winner, you're a Nobel prize winner forever.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.840
&gt;&gt; So, Shapley, the Nobel prize winner, and

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.200
as we're going to see in a moment, this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.070
model is actually a generalization of MDPs, but

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.230
Shapley published it before Bellman published about MDPs.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.070
&gt;&gt; Oh. This is pre-Bellman.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.060
So MDPs, to some extent, can be thought of

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.639
as a narrowing of the definition of a stochastic game.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:11.614
&gt;&gt; Huh.

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:17.400
&gt;&gt; So, all right. Let's do a little quiz. And see that we

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.510
really understand the relationship between this model

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.580
and other things that we've talked about.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.330
&gt;&gt; Okay.
