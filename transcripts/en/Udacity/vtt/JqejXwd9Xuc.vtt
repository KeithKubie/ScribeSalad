00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
As we hinted before, this special syntax in HTML is called a tag.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It's kind of like a price tag you might attach to a shirt or another item you're buying.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
This modifies nearby text and tells you how to interpret it,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
whether you can wash it or not in a machine, how much it costs,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
whether or not it should be bolded or underlined--that sort of thing.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Another super common kind of tag is the anchor tag,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
which is used to add hyperlinks to webpages.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In some sense this is the defining characteristic of what it means to be a webpage.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Here I've written a fragment of HTML that includes such an anchor tag.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
It begins here, but unlike the relatively simple bold and underline tags,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
it has an argument.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
This means pretty much the same thing it did when we were talking

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
about functions in Python or math.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here the argument or my sine function is pi.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Here the argument or modifier for my anchor tag is href equals.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This stands for hypertext reference--the target of this link.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Here I've given a string that is a URL, a web address.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Hypertext transfer protocol google.com.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
This text in the middle is often rendered in blue with an underline, although it doesn't have to be.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Then over here we're ending the anchoring tag. Let's see how this plays out.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Here I've the old "Eric Blair was really George Orwell" text,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
but I've added a new sentence--"Click here for a link to a webpage."

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Right after the anchor starts, the text is rendered in a slightly different color.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
If we were to click on it, you can potentially see down in the lower left

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
that it goes to google.com.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Just to break this down, if this is a fragment of HTML,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
then the words "Click here and now" will all be drawn on the screen.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This syntax marks the beginning of the anchor tag.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
This syntax, left angle bracket slash a right angle bracket,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
marks the end of the anchor tag.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This part in here is the argument of the tag.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It contains extra information for things that are more complicated

00:02:07.000 --> 09:59:59.000
than simple bold or underline.
