00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
[Dr. Wilson] So let's now start talking about what is the deep web.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.300
Because your web server can say a few things.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.440
As well as saying "here's your page"

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.300
it can also say "I don't know what that page is."

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:11.900
So if I say...

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.800
Can we go to "nottingham.ac.uk/freeStuffForMax"?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.200
It goes: I'm sorry I don't know what that is.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.200
Page not found. We don't have "free stuff for max".

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.800
It can also say you're not allowed to
go there.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.350
So it can say if I want to go to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.369
"nottingham.ac.uk/hr/increaseMySalary.html"

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.190
It will say "sorry you can't go there" that's a bit of the web you're not allowed to see and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.000
that's really what the Deep Web is is
bits of the web that google is not to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.120
see or can't find or hasn't found and so
the easiest way of looking at the Deep

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.050
Web is it's just a huge portion of the
web which google doesn't have the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.610
password to go and see your hasn't come
across yet or is sitting unconnected to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.610
the rest of web somewhere

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.190
there's four bits

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.269
of what makes the deep web or four nice
examples, let's say, of what makes the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:04.120
Deep Web different from the web

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.250
one is that stuff behind passwords so
any place that you go we have to type in

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.360
the password is a place that Google can
coax it doesn't have your password so it

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.340
it can't look at your bank information, it can't look at your profile page on amazon.co.uk

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.280
and in fact if you make your profile on
facebook not public

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.640
you essentially pulled your profile on
facebook down into the deep web rather

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.479
than having it on the surface bit of the
web and but all the normal pages like

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.350
the main page of facebook.com is on
the normal web the surface web that google

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.490
can see it just simply can't get X it
doesn't have to probe the password that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.179
you have

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.440
there's also lots of dynamic content so
this is the second part content which

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.890
gets generated based on what you do or
where you are is that

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.500
and so if you go on to amazon.co.uk
and search for something Google hasn't

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.890
seen that search results because it
hasn't typed in every single possible

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.929
word you could ever type into amazon search

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.319
so you see the products. It's found most
of the products, so it's indexed all those

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.970
pages because it has links to on the
front page of amazon but it hasn't seen

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.450
all the dynamic things that you create
because you typed in a word that it had

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.940
thought typing in and so this is dynamic
content that it can't access and so your

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.340
facebook feed is another type of dynamic
content which is always changing and so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.550
it's A) it can't get there because it doesn't have the
password and B) the last time i looked

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.220
it was different to the time you just
looked so hasn't seen it

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.700
there's also something called the robot
exclusion standard which is a nice thing

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.379
that's most websites have a little file
which is robots.txt on the server and

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.910
that says to google or other things are
browsing automatically you can look at

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.940
those pages but please don't look at
those pages and Google simply just

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.489
doesn't look at them because it was asked not to.
So there's large portions that the

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.420
website designers say please don't index
this but you can look at that

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.069
[Brady] Does that just rely on trust though

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.800
[Dr Wilson] Yes. Yeah, so you could write a spider that
works like Google spider which just

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.680
ignores robots.txt but you'd be somewhat
breaking the rules by doing that. Um...

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.600
[Brady] Is that a legal thing, or just...?

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.020
[Dr Wilson] I don't know is the fair answer

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.860
It could be... it
could just be a politeness thing just like

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.230
most standards on the internet.
And so then the four type of stuff

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.099
that's in the Deep Web is just stuff
that nobody's ever linked to it, so it's never

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.880
been found as this google spiders have
never followed a link to find it and

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.170
therefore it's just it's there but
Google hasn't seen it so it's not that

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.840
it's hard to access is just so deep that
nobody's found it

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.989
so my laptop has a web server on it HTTP
server and so i can host web files on my

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.540
laptop and when I connected it to the
Internet

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.489
it got a unique address and so people
can type in that address and then see the

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.180
web pages that are on my laptop and so
technically kind of anybody could do

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.180
that and then you just tell your friends

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.860
the unique kind of code for how to get
there.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.060
Not the web link because you didn't create
web link maybe and your friends type in

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.099
the 1.128.193.274, go look
at your laptop and then never tell

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:04.410
anybody else about it because your
little secret web page for you and your

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.700
friends and so that's just a part of the
web that Google never came across and it

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.940
won't come across it until either you
tell Google about it or someone links to

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.320
it from another web page that Google's seen.
And so all this is deep web stuff and

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.010
which is perfectly normal stuff that Google just doesn't have access to or

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.750
hasn't found and so that's the best way
to look at the Deep Web is just all the

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.800
parts of the web that Google can't just
walk up and see, or hasn't come and

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.880
visited yet. So how big is the Deep
Web is an interesting question

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.419
Google's index for the normal web or surface web went past

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.479
1 trillion pages not too long ago
that was a kind of milestone it went

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:40.229
past

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.820
so Google knows about one trillion pages
but latest estimates of the Deep Web

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.440
that it's ninety-five percent whereas
the five percent that google has seen is

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.539
there's one trillion pages so it's much much
bigger 500 times bigger and that

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:57.810
sort of makes sense because ninety five
percent of facebook is stuff you look at

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.110
after you've logged in with your
password so and there's only a small

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.430
portion that Google can see which is
before you log in and and there's whole

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.419
websites which you just need a password
to access forums or academic literature

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.560
or just huge resources of content that
google doesn't go and see

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.970
and so it's very very big it's just not
very scary and not very unusual

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.330
it's just behind passwords. So this takes
us then towards the dark web

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.680
because we now know what the internet is
and the physical connections we got the

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.490
web is which is just software for
transferring information and we know the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.570
Deep Web is which is just the bits as
the web we have seen so what is the dark

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:37.080
web

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.479
so the best way to look at the dark web
is that it's just the web but built

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:45.360
differently so it's not surprising
really and then the web was just some

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.240
software that someone built in this
describes how people share information

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.770
and so you could rebuild that and put it
so saying get that page you could have

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.169
built it to say send me that page

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.560
you know it's just asked a different
question use a different code speaking

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.180
it's like a different language and so
there are several dark webs on the

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.450
internet they sit on the internet and
overlay the same internet like the

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:07.140
web does

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.610
they just talk different languages they
have secret handshakes and and they

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.960
encrypt things in different ways and
they store websites in different places

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.870
and you have to look at you have to go
somewhere else to find out where it is

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:23.580
and so a good example of a dark web is
tour which is the onion where they call

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.900
it then you go to . onion pages rather
than . com pages

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.610
you know it's just different language
different codes and they the way you

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.070
asked for a page is differently so ever

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.940
where you might have in to Chrome and
say I'd like to see that page about

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:46.530
horses which is on the dark web and the
dark web goes or would you can get page

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:47.190
about horses

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:51.390
that's not how we do things here so you
kind of have to say the panda has orange

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.409
shoes and then suddenly gives you that
page about horses that you wanted the

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:58.080
interest is just talking a different
language is essentially transferring

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.150
pages of information like the web does

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.900
you just have to ask it the right way so
does not mean that all the people who've

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:08.940
got websites out there would have to
rebuild their website as an onion type

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:15.480
we're only if you want to be only on the
onion whip and so you can be browsing

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.010
the interweb using Tor which is the
onion browser and that we can look

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.520
perfectly well a normal web pages you
can go to Google on it but it also knows

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.600
how to or where to find out where the
onion physical computers are and then it

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.250
knows how to ask for it and and it's the
other thing it does there was something

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.910
is it sends you on a secret strange and
unusual route through the internet to

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:36.450
get there

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.730
so if you look at google.com on Tor but
when i did this morning it was in German

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:45.060
because the last place that I came out
on the strange the route was in the

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.240
computer somewhere in Germany and this
is sort of why they call it the onion

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.190
web because it has many layers that you
go through

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.790
so when it asks to view a web page it
wraps up that request into several

00:07:53.790 --> 00:07:57.750
layers of encryption and then send it to
the first computer which unlocks the

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.050
first layer and says okay thanks now i
know where to go for the second one goes

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.680
to a computer in Australia and says
unwrap the next layer and then it goes

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.910
to a computer German accent and that one
asks my google have come to see it and

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:12.240
then it kind of gets wrapped back up
again comes all the way back to you and

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:15.870
which is why they call it the onion and
web for the onion browser

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:20.700
it sounds like a kind of huge game of
pass the parcel mixed in with one of

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.550
those old nineteen eighties films where
somebody's trying to trace that

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:26.070
complicated really clear phone call or
something

00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:29.130
I'm gonna bounce just call through nine
different relay stations throughout the

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.600
world and our two satellites this
designed to be more anonymous and more

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.320
private and what you're doing so it's
also a bit like a secret spy who's kind

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:40.620
of got into a building suddenly and
taking off his coat and hat he's wearing

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.310
an apron and then walks into the kitchen
and seems perfectly normal in there and

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.590
then as you get out the back of the
kitchen he takes off the apron is in

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:50.370
overalls and then suddenly drops down
into the sewer and he kind of goes along

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.090
a bit in there is a overall is looking
like a sewer here and then pops up the

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:57.480
top takes off his overalls in a perfect
suit ready to go for a meeting somewhere

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.480
to get a package and then has to do the
reverse to get back in

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.620
so it protects you and anonymity by
encrypting everything and lots of layers

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.520
sending in an unusual routes that you
would normally expect and then avoids

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.960
being sort of seen on the

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.440
more servers and then on the way and by
doing that

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:19.080
so yeah so basically that's why I into
your analogy that come interact with

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:22.680
just the normal world or you can talk to
the spies is that a good way of thinking

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.250
of it

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:26.850
yeah it's it can do either the secret
stuff that's on Tor. I can do the normal

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.750
stuff that's on the normal web and so
people have to say all the dark web

00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:34.620
that's the place where bad things happen
and that's not what it's designed for

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.100
the fact that it's anonymous means that
bad things can happen on it more easily

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.110
but you can do good things on it when
you have more anonymity so it's slightly

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:47.040
safer perhaps to go and do your online
banking in a public cafe

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:53.040
if you encrypted first and there is a
HTTPS which is secure HTTP and that's

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.700
one way of making more secure but then
you can also wrap it and onion layers

00:09:56.700 --> 00:10:02.040
and send often so suddenly you're sort
of more safe in a public place and doing

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:04.140
something that you want to do more
privately

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:11.190
so is it dangerous is a question of what
use your anonymity for rather than that

00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:14.520
it's specifically designed for dangerous
things because people anonymous they can

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.620
do things which are less legal perhaps. I
don't know there's some known flaw of

00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:24.900
the onion web and there's ways of
tracking what happens if you carefully

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:31.350
synchronize events that happened the
different stages and you can also if you

00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:36.030
view things like Flash over the Tor
browser that breaks all the ideas of it

00:10:36.030 --> 00:10:40.140
because it's this built-in different way
so when you login to tourists and to say

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.080
don't use Flash because that will give
away your location but if you do this

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.710
normal stuff that will be fine, and but
there are people who use it to put on

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.500
pages so those things like the silkroad
which is people knew about which is a

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.060
place where people could sell and buy
drugs because and you were more

00:10:57.060 --> 00:11:00.270
anonymous so that people could host the
website more honest me and all the

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.779
people could go and visit in on

00:11:01.779 --> 00:11:07.300
anonymously. So it's illegal activity
that's been facilitated by anonymity

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.930
there's lots of positive things that
could be facilitated by anonymity so

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:16.449
people who are in an oppressive areas
can browse the web or anonymously

00:11:16.449 --> 00:11:19.449
they can communicate with people more
honestly and so on

00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:23.559
so let's bring it all back together and
talk about the difference in the Deep

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:27.850
Web the dark web the web and so on so
and the Deep Web was just an area which

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:32.199
is fairly normal of the web or just
behind passwords or does not found and

00:11:32.199 --> 00:11:35.499
the dark web is a part of the deep work
for us it's a different copy of the web

00:11:35.499 --> 00:11:40.629
really which specifically tries to hide
itself was talking secret code is

00:11:40.629 --> 00:11:45.339
wearing camouflage and its hiding as
much as it can be different and to be out of

00:11:45.339 --> 00:11:49.420
the way away from google and so then
just makes it private

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.649
so the physical internet of computers is
kind of physical connections or

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:57.040
computers together that have IP
addresses each one of those physical

00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:02.410
computers can have a web server on it so
that it can talk in software and share

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:05.559
information and pages and so this is the
web

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:09.579
the Deep Web is just part of it which
people can't get too easily and then the

00:12:09.579 --> 00:12:12.699
dark web is like a copy of the web that
talks in just the different ways

00:12:12.699 --> 00:12:15.699
different languages

00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:22.110
start with the basics of the weapon
internet and because most people confuse

00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:25.200
those as well as confusing the Deep Web
in the dark where and how the different

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:28.320
and we're just going to try and figure
all that out today
