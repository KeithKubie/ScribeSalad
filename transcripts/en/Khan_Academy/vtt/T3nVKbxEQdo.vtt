00:00:00.534 --> 00:00:02.554
- [Voiceover] A secant
line intersects the graph

00:00:02.554 --> 00:00:06.047
of f of x is equal to
x squared plus five x

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:09.669
at two points with x
coordinates three and t

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:12.551
where t does not equal three.

00:00:12.551 --> 00:00:15.585
What is the slope of the
secant line in terms of t?

00:00:15.585 --> 00:00:19.404
Your answer must be fully
expanded and simplified.

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:21.015
And my apologies ahead
of time if I'm a little

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:22.139
out of breath.

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:24.261
I just tried to do some
exercises in my office

00:00:24.261 --> 00:00:26.331
to get some blood moving
and I think I'm still

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:27.469
a little out of breath.

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:31.117
Anyway, so we want to
find the slope of the

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:32.723
secant line

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:34.477
and they essentially give us two points

00:00:34.477 --> 00:00:35.830
on the secant line.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.256
They tell us what x is at
each of those two points

00:00:39.256 --> 00:00:40.995
and if we know what an x is,

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:42.731
we are able to figure out what f of x is

00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:44.170
at each of those points.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.161
So we could make a little table here.

00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:49.828
We know x and we know f of x.

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:54.040
So when x is equal to three

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.357
what is f of x?

00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:57.713
Well it's going to be three squared

00:00:57.713 --> 00:00:59.546
plus five times three.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.956
Well this is going to be nine plus 15

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:04.956
which is 24.

00:01:05.837 --> 00:01:07.920
So this is going to be 24

00:01:09.308 --> 00:01:11.558
and when x is equal to t

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:14.990
what is f of t?

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.740
Well it is going to be
t squared plus five t.

00:01:20.306 --> 00:01:22.859
And so we have two points
now that are on this line,

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:24.027
this is the secant line.

00:01:24.027 --> 00:01:25.979
It intersects our function twice

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.795
so it has these two points on it.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.042
So we just have to find
our change in y between

00:01:30.042 --> 00:01:31.690
these two points.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.988
Change in y and our
change in x, change in x.

00:01:35.988 --> 00:01:39.061
And I'm assuming that
y is equal to f of x.

00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:41.894
So our slope of our secant line is

00:01:42.927 --> 00:01:44.538
change in y

00:01:44.538 --> 00:01:46.070
over change in x.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.831
Our change in y, if we
view this as our end point,

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.831
the second one with the
t in it is our end point

00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:53.858
is going to be that minus that.

00:01:53.858 --> 00:01:57.275
So it's going to be t squared plus five t

00:01:58.502 --> 00:01:59.335
minus 24

00:02:01.378 --> 00:02:05.330
and then in our denominator our ending x

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.096
minus our starting x is
going to be t minus three.

00:02:10.096 --> 00:02:11.561
Now they tell us our answer must be fully

00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:13.072
expanded and simplified.

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:15.367
So maybe there's a way to
simplify this a little bit.

00:02:15.367 --> 00:02:17.813
Let's see, can I factor
the top into something

00:02:17.813 --> 00:02:19.490
that involves

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.823
a t minus three?

00:02:23.582 --> 00:02:25.165
All right,

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:26.448
so in the numerator, let's see,

00:02:26.448 --> 00:02:27.537
negative three

00:02:27.537 --> 00:02:29.488
times positive eight is negative 24.

00:02:29.488 --> 00:02:31.404
Negative three plus
positive eight is five.

00:02:31.404 --> 00:02:33.639
So we can rewrite this as

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:34.639
t plus eight

00:02:36.078 --> 00:02:36.911
times t

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:40.776
times t minus three.

00:02:43.253 --> 00:02:46.153
And so we could say this
is going to be equal to

00:02:46.153 --> 00:02:48.349
if we cancel out the t
minus three or we divide

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.892
the numerator into the
denominator by t minus three

00:02:50.892 --> 00:02:54.700
it's going to be equal to t plus eight.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.535
Now if we wanted to be really strict,

00:02:57.535 --> 00:02:59.410
mathematically strict,

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.787
this expression isn't
exactly the same as our

00:03:02.787 --> 00:03:04.807
original expression right over here.

00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:06.382
What makes them different?

00:03:06.382 --> 00:03:08.204
Well they're going to
be true for all of t's

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.176
except where t equals three.

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.835
This thing right over here
is defined at t equals three.

00:03:12.835 --> 00:03:15.674
In fact when t equals three
this expression is equal to 11.

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:19.798
But this thing up here was
not defined at t equals three

00:03:19.798 --> 00:03:21.878
so if you wanted to be particular about it

00:03:21.878 --> 00:03:24.987
you want this expression
to be the exact same thing

00:03:24.987 --> 00:03:26.070
you would say

00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:29.494
four t does not equal three.

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:34.528
Now this can take the
same inputs as this one

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:35.945
right over there.

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:40.392
But I'm assuming where
t does not equal three.

00:03:40.392 --> 00:03:43.526
So you could view this
as maybe a little bit

00:03:43.526 --> 00:03:44.359
redundant.

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.253
But this would be,

00:03:45.253 --> 00:03:49.420
this is the slope of the
secant line in terms of t.
